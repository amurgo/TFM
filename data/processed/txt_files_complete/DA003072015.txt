Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Parkin, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Presenting Officer (14 March 2016)
     Mr L Tarlow, Presenting Officer (5 July 2016)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow promulgated on 13 January 2016.

 2. Mr Gomes Semedo, to whom I refer as the  appellant,  is  a  citizen  of
    Portugal born on 10 January 1996.  He entered the United Kingdom  as  a
    dependant  of  his  mother  on  13  July  2009.   He  has  lived   here
    continuously since then, attending school and then college.  He has two
    children from two different relationships.

 3. The appellant has a number of convictions:-

      a) On 29 September 2011 a conviction at Stratford Juvenile  Court  for
         handling stolen goods  resulting  in  a  referral  order  for  nine
         months.

      b) On 28 March 2012 he was cautioned for shoplifting.

      c) On 27 May 2014 he was convicted of travelling on  a  train  without
         paying a fare and fined �50 plus costs.

      d) On 29 May 2014 theft from a dwelling and sentenced to pay a fine of
         �150 and costs.

      e) On 11 March 2015 at  Snaresbrook  Crown  Court  of  two  counts  of
         robbery and sentenced to two years' imprisonment.

 4. On  account  of  the  most  recent  and  most  serious  conviction  the
    respondent  made  a  deportation  order  against  him.   The  appellant
    appealed against that decision pursuant to  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations").

 5. The appeal came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  sitting  at  Hendon
    Magistrates' Court on  23  December  2015.   The  judge,  having  heard
    evidence from the appellant, his mother and  his  girlfriend  concluded
    that:-

      i) the appellant had not acquired a permanent right of  residence  due
         to a gap of five months and 25 days between  13  July  2012  and  7
         January 2013 [4],  it  being  noted  [23]  that  he  did  not  have
         compulsory medical insurance which would have been  necessary  were
         he to have claimed the right of residence as a student;

     ii) he appellant represents  a  low  risk  of  re-offending  [25],  the
         offender manager having found that he  posed  a  low  risk  of  re-
         offending and a medium risk of serious harm to others in the  OASys
         assessment to which weight could be attached;

    iii) the appellant fell into the category of offender identified in Essa
         (EEA: rehabilitation/integration) [2013] UKUT 00316 at [32]-[34] in
         that his life in the United  Kingdom  is  likely  to  be  with  the
         support of his mother and girlfriend while  he  re-establishes  his
         life in the community under licence;

     iv) Taking into account all the  circumstances,  his  removal  was  not
         justified  in  order  to  address   any   "genuine,   present   and
         sufficiently serious threat" posed by his continued presence [29].

 6. The respondent sought permission to appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    judge had erred:-

      i) In failing to provide reasons for the finding  that  the  appellant
         intends to lead an honest life which  underpinned  the  conclusions
         that  the  appellant  did  not  present  a  genuine,  present   and
         sufficiently serious threat;

     ii) in finding that he presented a low risk, had failed  adequately  to
         address the continued denial of the offence for which he  had  been
         convicted in the context of a  lengthy  and  prolonged  history  of
         offending;

    iii)  in  concluding  that  the  respondent  was  seeking   to   justify
         deportation solely on the  basis  of  past  offending  contrary  to
         Regulation 21(5)(e) and thus the finding that he  did  not  pose  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat is  unsustainable.



     iv) in failing to consider  the  principle  of  proportionality  within
         Regulation 21(5)(a) and the finding that the appellant  intends  to
         return to college and support his children were equally lacking  in
         reasons.

      v) in his assessment of rehabilitation by failing to take into account
         the decision MC (Essa principles recast) Portugal [2015]  UKUT  520
         in light of the decision in Dumliauskas & Others  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
         45.

 7. On 29 January 2016 First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher granted  permission
    on all grounds.

    The hearing on 14 March 2016

 8. Mr Jarvis submitted that the judge's findings were unclear it being not
    at all clear whether he  had  concluded  that  the  appellant  did  not
    constitute a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat  before
    going on to assess matters which  improperly  included  a  reliance  on
    possible rehabilitation.  He submitted further that the judge had erred
    in his approach to the  OASys  Report,  this  is  not  binding  on  the
    Secretary of State.

 9. Mr Parkin accepted that it was unclear whether the judge had  concluded
    that  the  appellant  did  not  constitute  a  genuine,   present   and
    sufficiently serious threat although it was implicit  in  the  decision
    that he had reached this conclusion.  He  submitted  that  the  judge's
    approach to the OASys Report was open to the judge and that  the  judge
    had not misdirected himself with respect to that.

The Law

10. The powers of the United Kingdom to exclude and remove from the  United
    Kingdom, that is to deport, are governed by the Citizenship  Directive.
    Its provisions are reflected in  Regulations  19  and  21  of  the  EEA
    Regulations. Reg. 21 provides as follows:-










    Decisions taken on public policy, public  security  and  public  health
grounds


    21.     (1)       In this regulation a "relevant decision" means an EEA
             decision  taken  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health.


         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.


         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
             with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15 except
             on serious grounds of public policy or public security.


         ...


         (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
             or public security it shall, in addition to complying with the
             preceding  paragraphs  of  this  regulation,   be   taken   in
             accordance with the following principles-


             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;


             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;


             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
                  represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
                  threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                  society;


             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;


             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.


         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
             policy or public security in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
             resident in the United Kingdom the decision  maker  must  take
             account of considerations such as the age,  state  of  health,
             family and economic situation  of  the  person,  the  person's
             length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's social
             and cultural integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
             extent of the person's links with his country of origin.

11. I do not accept, contrary to what is averred in the grounds  of  appeal
    at [1] that the judge has not provided full reasons  for  the  findings
    set out at [24]; that is evidently a summary of  what  follows  in  the
    paragraphs set out below.  Further, it was sufficiently clear from  the
    determination that the judge was aware of the  appellant's  denial  and
    took this into account; what is said in the grounds  at  [3]  does  not
    identify that the judge's assessment of this matter  was  perverse  nor
    for that matter do I consider that the judge's reference at [25] to the
    Secretary of State's intentions identify any error of law.

12. What is said in the grounds at [6] and [7] do not  identify  errors  of
    law.  The fact that these are said to be submissions is indicative that
    this is an attempt simply to put the Secretary of State's  case  rather
    than to identify any error.  This is not a lack of evidence in terms of
    findings nor do they properly identify that the judge's  findings  were
    perverse.

13. As was noted in Dumliauskas at [55] the power to deport  is  predicated
    on a real risk  of  re-offending.   That  is  also  apparent  from  the
    decision in SSHD v Straszewski [2015] EWCA Civ 1245, in  particular  at
    [17].

14. It is evident from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal at [18]-[22]
    that the judge directed himself properly as to  the  law  although  not
    identifying the facts as provided for in Dumliauskas [55].

15. There is, I consider, merit in the submission that the judge's decision
    is unclear as to whether he found that the  appellant  does  present  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat.   The  finding  that
    someone is at low risk of re-offending  is  not  of  itself  sufficient
    given that here it is also clear from the OASys Report that in two  out
    of the three categories the risk was medium.  Indeed,  the  probability
    of proven re-offending as part of the OGRS3  score  is  57%  after  two
    years, 39% after one year.  That is not to say that the judge was wrong
    to attach weight to the OASys scores as a whole.

16. While I accept that it would in the circumstances have been open to the
    judge given the other findings of fact to conclude that removal was not
    proportionate, the findings on that do rely on what was said in Essa to
    a significant degree.  There is no indication that the judge was  aware
    of the difficulties in so doing  as  identified  in  Dumliauskas.   The
    position is as set out helpfully in MC (Essa recast) in the headnote.

17. The fact that the judge did go on  to  consider  rehabilitation  is  an
    indication that he had  found  that  the  appellant  does  represent  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat given that, had he not
    done so there would have been no need to consider these  issues  -  see
    Dumliauskas at [52]-[55].

18. Accordingly, I  am  satisfied  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did involve the making of an error of law in  that  the  judge
    failed properly to address the issue or indeed answer the  question  of
    whether the applicant is a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat. That error  is  made  material  by  the  flawed  assessment  of
    proportionality flowing from a failure of the judge to  direct  himself
    as to the prospects of  rehabilitation  and  in  directing  himself  to
    follow Essa  rather  than  directing  himself  to  follow  Dumliauskas.
    Accordingly, I set the decision aside for it to be remade.

    Hearing on 5 July 2016

19. Given that the appellant is  aged  under  21  and  was,  prior  to  his
    imprisonment, living with his  mother  who,  as  it  appears  from  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Social Security), had acquired the
    permanent right of residence on 3 December  2014,  Mr  Tarlow  accepted
    that the appellant had in fact acquired permanent residence, before his
    imprisonment.

20. It then became apparent that the appellant had now been  released  from
    detention, was employed, and was living with his  mother.   Although  I
    had given directions to remake the decision in the Upper  Tribunal,  it
    in reality, given the change in circumstances since the hearing in  the
    First-tier Tribunal, it would be necessary to make  fresh  findings  of
    fact an all material issues through the prism of  the  acceptance  that
    the appellant now meets the requirements of reg.  21  (3)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.



SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS.

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error of law and I set it aside.

 2.  I  remit  the  decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a   fresh
    determination on all issues, save the acceptance by the respondent that
    the appellant acquired the permanent right of residence  prior  to  his
    imprisonment in 2015.
