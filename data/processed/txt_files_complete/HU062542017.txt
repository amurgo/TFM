For the Appellant:     Mr Oshunrinade, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a national of Zimbabwe, was aged 10 years  of  age  when
    she applied on February 7, 2017 for leave to enter the  United  Kingdom
    under paragraph 297 HC 395.  She had applied to  join  her  mother  and
    stepfather who live in the United Kingdom.

 2. The respondent refused her application on April 5, 2017  on  the  basis
    that she did not satisfy the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The respondent considered the application with reference  to  paragraph
    297 HC 395.

 3. Her appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal E M M Smith  on
    April 11, 2018 and in a decision promulgated  on  April  13,  2018  her
    appeal was dismissed  on  human  rights  grounds.   In  dismissing  her
    appeal, the Judge considered  the  appeal  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules and, in particular, Section  EC-C.   The  reason  the
    Judge considered it under this provision rather than paragraph  297  HC
    395 was the appellant's mother only had discretionary leave  to  remain
    and in order to succeed under paragraph  297  HC  395  the  appellant's
    mother had to have settled status.

 4. The appellant appealed this decision on  April  23,  2018  arguing  the
    Judge had materially erred.  The grounds stated the appellant wished to
    provide further evidence of her school attendance and  performance  and
    to provide a statement outlining her own wishes to live in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The grounds themselves did not identify a specific  error  in
    law, although I found on the Tribunal file additional grounds that were
    dated May, 25 2018 and had been submitted later, albeit  only  received
    by the Tribunal on August 8, 2018.

 5. Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  O'Callaghan  granted  permission  to
    appeal on July 13, 2018 without having seen these  additional  grounds.
    The Judge noted that the appellant/sponsors were unrepresented  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal  hearing  and  found  there  was  an  "obvious  and
    arguable issue" arising from the Judge's finding that  a  12  year  old
    child was leading an independent life with her grandmother, and  having
    found the sponsors maintained the appellant to a large degree,  it  was
    also arguable the Judge had erred in saying there was no evidence of  a
    strong mother/child relationship.

 6. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response dated  September  26,  2018  in
    which he argued that as the appellant failed to  demonstrate  they  met
    the Immigration Rules, the Judge was entitled  to  reach  the  findings
    contained in the actual decision.

 7. No anonymity direction is made.

    SUBMISSIONS

 8. Mr Oshunrinade accepted the additional grounds received by the Tribunal
    on August 8, 2018 may have been filed as  additional  grounds  as  they
    postdated not only the date of the written grounds but also a date that
    the Judge granting permission  had  considered  them.   He  raised  two
    issues, namely the finding by the Judge that the appellant was  leading
    an independent life; and secondly, the  Judge's  finding  about  family
    unit.  He submitted that the finding at paragraph  26  of  the  Judge's
    decision was flawed because the appellant was a 12-year-old  child  and
    could not be living an independent life.  He pointed out that  she  was
    under the age of 18, unmarried and  had  maintained  contact  with  her
    mother and her stepfather and the  latter  had  visited  her  on  three
    occasions.  There was evidence financial support  was  being  provided.
    The Judge erred by placing too much weight on the fact the  appellant's
    mother had  not  visited  her  daughter  since  leaving  Zimbabwe,  but
    overlooked the fact that her partner had visited  the  appellant.   The
    Judge was wrong to find the appellant was living a separate/independent
    life.

 9. Mr Bramble relied on the  Rule  24  response  and  submitted  that  the
    appellant had not demonstrated compliance with  the  Immigration  Rules
    and having considered the limited evidence placed before the  Tribunal,
    the Judge concluded that the  appellant's  family  unit  was  with  her
    grandmother and no longer with her mother.   At  paragraph  19  of  the
    decision the Judge set out the evidence  that  was  considered  and  at
    paragraph 30 the Judge made it clear that he had tried  to  extract  as
    much  information  as  possible  out  of  the  sponsors  and  that  the
    appellant's bundle, handed in on the day of hearing  only  contained  a
    single letter from a doctor in Harare and evidence of  money  transfers
    that dated back to 2010.  He submitted that paragraphs 26 and 28 of the
    decision adequately dealt with the issues and that the current  grounds
    of appeal amounted to a disagreement.  The Judge had made it  clear  in
    the decision that if additional evidence had been adduced it would have
    given him more to consider.

10. Mr Oshunrinade responded to these submissions and pointed out that  the
    stepfather was a British citizen, although he  accepted  the  appellant
    had never lived with the stepfather but had met him on three occasions.
      He  reiterated  that  the  finding  the  appellant  was  leading   an
    independent life was flawed and he invited the Tribunal  to  set  aside
    the decision.

    FINDINGS ON GROUNDS

11. This appeal originally came before Judge Smith who unfortunately had no
    representatives  before  him.   The  appellant's  mother  and   partner
    attended at the appeal hearing, but there was  no  representation  from
    the respondent's office  and  the  Judge  took  this  into  account  as
    evidenced by the content of paragraph  30  of  the  decision  where  he
    wrote:

         "... as the  sponsor  and  the  mother  were  unrepresented  I  had
         endeavoured to extract as much favourable  evidence  from  them  as
         possible ..."

12. The grounds for which permission has now been granted did not  identify
    any error in law but sought to address the concerns raised by the Judge
    with additional evidence.  I was satisfied that the additional  grounds
    of appeal that were received by the Tribunal on August 8, 2018 had  not
    been lodged with the application or considered by the  Judge  who  gave
    permission.  Nevertheless, I have considered  those  grounds  alongside
    the submissions that were made to me as permission to appeal  had  been
    granted.

13. The main challenge centred around paragraph 26 of the Judge's  decision
    in which the Judge wrote:-

         "I am satisfied that the appellant cannot satisfy the provisions of
         paragraph E-LTRC.1.4. and 1.5. in that it is clear that she is  not
         part of the sponsor or the mother's family and that for the last 10
         years she has formed an independent life with  her  grandmother  in
         Zimbabwe".

14. Paragraph E-LTRC.1.4. and 1.5 of Appendix FM are the  wrong  provisions
    to apply because they relate to eligibility requirements for  leave  to
    remain as a child and the Judge in this appeal was  concerned  with  an
    application for entry clearance.  Having said  that,  the  relationship
    requirements referred to by the Judge mirror  the  correct  provisions,
    namely paragraphs E-ECC.1.4. and  1.5.   The  reference  to  the  wring
    provision would not amount to an error in law.

15. The question for this Tribunal to consider was whether the  wording  of
    paragraph 26 amounted to an error in law.

16. Having considered the submissions I am not persuaded that it does.

17. What the Judge stated, albeit perhaps the  use  of  independent  should
    have been omitted, was that the appellant had formed a  life  with  her
    grandmother in Zimbabwe and the Judge concluded that the appellant  was
    leading a separate life to one led by her  mother  and  was  no  longer
    wholly dependent upon either her mother or her partner.

18. In order to meet entry clearance requirements,  the  Judge  had  to  be
    satisfied that either the appellant's mother had and continued to  have
    sole responsibility for  the  appellant,  or  there  were  serious  and
    compelling family or other considerations which made exclusion  of  the
    child undesirable and that suitable arrangements had been made for  the
    child's care.

19. Whilst the Judge accepted at paragraph 28  of  his  decision  that  the
    appellant's mother had provided financial support, it is clear from the
    content of paragraphs 26 to 29 of the decision that the Judge  did  not
    accept the appellant's mother had sole  responsibility  or  that  there
    were any serious and compelling family or  other  considerations  which
    made her exclusion undesirable.

20. In order to satisfy the Immigration Rules the  appellant  also  had  to
    demonstrate that the financial requirements of E-ECC.2.1.  of  Appendix
    FM and the provisions of Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration  Rules  were
    met.  Looking at the respondent's  bundle  it  may  well  be  that  the
    minimum  income  requirement  could  be  met  because  the  appellant's
    mother's partner's annual salary was over �38,000 and  the  appellant's
    mother had earned �13,000 at the date of application  in  the  previous
    financial year.

21. However, there was no evidence that Appendix FM-SE  was  complied  with
    and this was a  requirement  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Whilst  the
    financial requirements were not considered by the Judge, the absence of
    the relevant documentation in either bundle meant the  appellant  could
    not satisfy the Rules. It therefore follows that the  Judge's  decision
    correctly addressed the relevant issues and the reference by the  Judge
    to "independent life"  had  to  be  read  in  context  rather  than  in
    isolation.

22. It was argued that the Judge  did  not  attach  enough  weight  to  the
    evidence concerning  the  appellant's  mother's  partner  visiting  the
    appellant, but ultimately this was something which would have had to be
    considered outside of the Immigration Rules where  the  starting  point
    would have been were the Immigration Rules  for  entry  clearance  met.
    The Judge was clearly hampered by a lack of  evidence  and  whilst  the
    concerns raised have  potentially  been  addressed,  in  part,  by  the
    grounds of appeal those documents were not before the Judge and are not
    matters that I can consider.

23. Having considered the evidence that was placed  before  the  Judge  and
    looking at his decision as a whole, I find there is no error in law and
    I dismiss the appeal.
