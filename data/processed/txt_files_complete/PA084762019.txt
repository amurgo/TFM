Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a  re-making  of  the  appellant's  claim  to  be  in  need  of
    humanitarian protection under Article 15(c) as  set  out  in  paragraph
    339C of the Immigration Rules:

         "Substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the  person
         concerned, if returned to the country of return, would face a  real
         risk of suffering serious harm and is unable,  or,  owing  to  such
         risk, unwilling to avail  themselves  of  the  protection  of  that
         country".

 2. The appellant is a national of Iraq, born on 1 January 1989.   He  came
    to the UK on 27 November 2007 at the age of 18.  He claimed asylum  but
    that claim was refused on 16 January 2009.  The appellant  appealed  to
    the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal and on 16 January 2009  Immigration
    Judge Wallace refused his appeal.  As set out in paragraph  11  of  the
    respondent's current refusal letter dated 21 August 2019, Judge Wallace
    did not find the appellant to be a credible witness  and  his  evidence
    was  found  to   be   vague   and   to   contain   contradictions   and
    inconsistencies.  Judge  Wallace  concluded  that  the  appellant  "has
    manufactured an asylum claim in an attempt to legitimise  his  stay  in
    the United Kingdom".

 3. The appellant became appeal rights  exhausted  on  5  March  2009.   He
    remained in the UK, however, and in 2018 applied for  indefinite  leave
    to remain. That application was refused on  19  April  2018.   He  made
    further submissions on asylum and  protection  grounds  on  20  January
    2019.  The respondent refused to grant leave  on  the  basis  of  those
    submissions but accepted that they amounted to a fresh claim.

 4. The appellant appealed again, this time  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    His appeal was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ford  in  a
    decision dated 27 January 2020.  Certain parts of that decision  remain
    relevant to the decision that must be made now.

 5. In paragraph 22 Judge Ford did not accept that the appellant had  never
    had a CSID document.   In  paragraph  23  Judge  Ford  found  that  the
    appellant could be expected to obtain details of his CSID document from
    adult male relatives in Iraq but had chosen not to do so.  In paragraph
    24 Judge Ford found further that the appellant was not consistent about
    his evidence of being able to contact his family in Iraq. In  paragraph
    25 (vi) Judge Ford again found the appellant "to be incredible  in  his
    account of only having one contact with his family after arrival in the
    UK and I find that he has lied on this issue".  She went on to find:

         "I find that he can contact his family should he choose to  do  so.
         I also find that he  has  a  father,  uncle  and  brother  who  can
         approach the government office where his  details  were  registered
         and assist him in securing the  necessary  details  to  re-document
         himself and secure a CSID".

 6. In paragraph 28 of the decision Judge Ford accepted that the  appellant
    was from Kirkuk.  In paragraph 29 she again found  that  the  appellant
    was able to  contact  adult  male  family  members  for  assistance  in
    securing documentation and that those family members  could  offer  him
    material support on his return to Iraq.

 7. In paragraph 30 Judge Ford concluded that  the  appellant's  claim  for
    protection because of a dispute with another family or  for  any  other
    reason was not credible.  She found:

         "His account continues to be vague and inconsistent and he has only
         added to the  credibility  concerns  in  his  further  submissions.
         Having assessed the evidence as a whole, he has failed to establish
         even the core of his claim to the lower standard of proof".

 8. The appellant appealed against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Ford.  His application was initially rejected by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in  a  decision  dated  5  March  2020.   However,  the  Upper
    Tribunal, in a decision  dated  15  May  2020,  granted  permission  to
    appeal.  The grant of permission said this:

         "2.   I  am  however  prepared  to  grant  permission.   It  is  in
                particular arguable that in its assessment  of  whether  the
                Appellant would be reasonably likely to obtain  an  identity
                document from the Iraqi Embassy in London [at FTT  �36]  the
                Tribunal has failed to have regard to Dr Fatah's evidence in
                AAH Iraq CG [2018] UKUT 00212 (IAC) that the embassy  staff,
                and the central  authorities  in  Iraq,  are  working  under
                significant  constraints  and  are  not  generally  helpful.
                Whilst it may remain possible to obtain documents  from  the
                embassy, the question for the Tribunal was  whether  it  was
                reasonably likely that this Appellant, who has been  in  the
                United Kingdom since 2007, could do so.

         3.   Given the guidance in SMO and Others  (Iraq)  CG  [2019]  UKUT
                00400 (IAC) the question of documentation  was  of  critical
                significance, at least as far as humanitarian protection  is
                concerned.  The First-tier Tribunal  accepts  [at  FTT  �32]
                that the Appellant's  home  area  is  Kirkuk.   In  SMO  the
                Tribunal found [at UT �431] it to be likely that Kirkuk  has
                a new 'INID' terminal  and  so  it  would  not  in  fact  be
                possible, as the First-tier  Tribunal  finds  here  [at  its
                �36], for a family member to  obtain  a  card  by  proxy  on
                behalf of the Appellant.  This would leave the Appellant  at
                Baghdad  Airport  with  no  identity  documents  for  onward
                travel, and in accordance with the  Home  Office  concession
                accepted  by  the  Tribunal  in  SMO,  at  a  real  risk  of
                destitution,  and  conditions  contrary   to   the   minimum
                standards set out in  Article  15(b)  of  the  Qualification
                Directive".

 9. The appeal then came before Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins on 26  October
    2020 for a decision on error of  law.   In  a  decision  issued  on  19
    November 2020, Judge Perkins found an error of law in the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Ford.  At  the  hearing  before  the  Judge
    Perkins, indicated in  paragraph  5  of  the  decision,  the  appellant
    indicated that he no longer intended to pursue the  asylum  element  of
    his claim but maintained the ground of  humanitarian  protection.   The
    issues in dispute at the error of law hearing were therefore limited to
    whether the appellant could obtain documentation enabling him to return
    to Iraq and travel safely to his home area of  Kirkuk.  The  respondent
    accepted that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in  the  assessment  of
    whether the appellant could obtain documentation enabling him to return
    safely to his home area; see paragraph  6  of  the  decision  of  Judge
    Perkins.  The error of law finding was limited to  this  narrow  point;
    see paragraph 10. The appeal was then reserved for a re-making  on  the
    limited issue  of  the  appellant's  ability  to  obtain  documentation
    enabling him to return to Iraq and travel  safely  to  his  home  area.
    Thus the appeal came before me.

10. A great deal is no longer in dispute. It  is  common  ground  that  the
    appellant does not have any form of identity document that  will  allow
    him either to return to Baghdad  Airport  or  to  travel  from  Baghdad
    Airport to his home area. From the decision of Judge Ford there are the
    extant findings that he is from Kirkuk and has a number of male  family
    members there who can be  expected  to  assist  him  in  obtaining  the
    documentation. The finding in paragraph 431 of SMO that it is  unlikely
    that the appellant's family in Iraq can  obtain  a  CISD  by  proxy  in
    Kirkuk was  not  disputed.  The  question  was  therefore  whether  the
    appellant could obtain  an  INID  or  other  document  from  the  Iraqi
    authorities in London enabling him to travel  to  Baghdad  airport  and
    onward to Kirkuk.

11. The parties before me accepted that the  country  evidence  on  how  an
    undocumented Iraqi might be able to return safely to Iraq has moved  on
    since the Tribunal's findings in SMO.  The latest material was set  out
    respondent's  Country  Policy  and  Information  Note  "Iraq:  Internal
    relocation, civil documentation and returns" issued in June 2020.  Both
    parties addressed me on this document.

12. The CPIN sets out in paragraphs 2.6.15 to 2.6.16:

         "2.6.15   Since  SMO  was  promulgated  in  December  2019  further
                information regarding the issuance of CSIDs in  the  UK  has
                been obtained by the Home Office in April  2020  [see  Annex
                I].  When asked to describe the process of obtaining a  CSID
                from the Iraqi  Embassy  in  London  the  Returns  Logistics
                department stated:

                    'CSID cards are being phased out and  replaced  by  INID
                    (Iraq  National  Identification)  cards.   It   is   not
                    currently possible to apply for an INID card outside  of
                    Iraq. As a result,  the  Iraqi  embassy  in  London  are
                    advising their nationals in the UK to apply instead  for
                    a 'Registration Document (1957)'  which they can use  to
                    apply for other documents such as passports or  an  INID
                    card once they have returned to Iraq.

                    'The registration document (1957) must be applied for on
                    the applicant's behalf by a nominated representative  in
                    Iraq.  In order to start the application, the individual
                    requiring documentation would normally provide at  least
                    one copy of a national identity document [see  paragraph
                    2.6.24 for list  of  national  identity  documents]  and
                    complete  a   power   of   attorney   (to   nominate   a
                    representative in Iraq) at the Iraqi embassy along  with
                    the embassy issued application forms.  If they  have  no
                    copies of identity documents they  also  would  need  to
                    complete a British power of attorney  validated  by  the
                    FCO and provide parents' names, place and date of  birth
                    to their nominated representative in Iraq.

                    'Once issued the nominated representative will send  the
                    registration document (1957) to the applicant in the UK.
                     The process takes 1-2 months.

                    'The  HO  cannot  apply  for  documentation  other  than
                    Laissez Passers on someone's behalf but the  embassy  is
                    willing to check to see if the individual already  holds
                    documents and provide copies if necessary.'

         2.6.16   Based on the above information, it is highly unlikely that
                an individual would be able to obtain a CSID from the  Iraqi
                Embassy while in the UK. Instead  a  person  would  need  to
                apply for a registration  document  (1957)  and  would  then
                apply for an INID upon return to their local CSA  office  in
                Iraq".

13. The CPIN at paragraph 5.6.4 relies on a European Asylum Support  Office
    (EASO) "Country of Origin Information Report - Iraq: Internal mobility"
    document dated February 2019 as confirmation that an INID:

         "... cannot be issued through Iraqi  embassies  and  Iraqis  abroad
         must go to Iraq to get one.  The cards cannot be issued to a  proxy
         representative due to the need for fingerprints and iris scans".

14. The most  recent  country  evidence  therefore  shows  that  the  Iraqi
    authorities  in   London   are   advising   Iraqi   nationals   without
    documentation to apply for  a  registration  document.   This  document
    "must  be  applied  for  on  the  applicant's  behalf  by  a  nominated
    representative in Iraq".  As before,  it  is  not  disputed  that  this
    appellant is has male relatives in Iraq who can make  that  application
    for him.  The fact that the appellant does not currently have a copy of
    a national identify document is not a bar as he can cure that  omission
    by way of a British power of attorney validated by the FCO and sent  to
    his relatives in Iraq.

15. The appellant argues that this process would be  difficult  because  of
    the approach taken by the Iraqi authorities in  London.  He  relies  on
    evidence given by an expert witness, Dr Fatah, in  an  earlier  country
    guidance case of AAH (Iraqi Kurds - internal relocation) Iraq  CG  UKUT
    00212 (IAC).  At paragraph 105 the Upper Tribunal set out as follows:

         "Second, the anecdotal evidence on the willingness of officials  to
         assist undocumented IDPs is not  promising.   Dr  Fatah  cites  the
         findings of the NGO 'Ceasefire Centre for Civilian Rights' who were
         told  by  interviewees  that  they  were  met  with   indifference,
         corruption, incompetence and even sarcasm by bureaucrats.  Dr Fatah
         confined his own observations on embassy staff in the UK to  saying
         that they are, in general,  'not  helpful'.   Dr  Fatah  attributes
         this, in part, to  the  fact  that  post-Saddam  many  professional
         career  civil  servants  were  sacked  in  the  process   of   'de-
         Ba'athification'".

16. It is my view, however, that, set against the clearly laid out  process
    for obtaining a registration document, the generalised  statement  from
    Dr Fatah that the embassy staff are "not helpful" is not sufficient  to
    show that the appellant will be unable to obtain the documents he needs
    to return to Iraq and travel to his home area where he  can  obtain  an
    INID.

17. Further, the  information  from  the  Iraqi  authorities  contained  in
    paragraph 2.6.16 of the CPIN states that someone who has a registration
    document can return to Iraq and then  obtain  an  INID  from  a  "local
    office". This indicates that a registration document is sufficient  for
    an individual to travel internally in Iraq to their home area and I was
    not taken to any material suggesting otherwise.

18. It is therefore  my  conclusion  that  the  appellant  can  obtain  the
    necessary documentation to return to Baghdad and then travel to  Kirkuk
    and can then obtain the INID he needs to re-establish himself in Iraq.

19. For these reasons, it is not my view that the appellant has shown  that
    he is in need of humanitarian protection.
