For the Appellant:     Mr  Tarlow,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Williams, CNA Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The Respondent is a national  of  Somalia  date  of  birth  20th
       October 1990. She currently resides in Kampala, Uganda.  On  the
       7th February 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Boyes)  allowed
       her appeal against the decision of the Respondent to refuse  her
       entry clearance to the UK as the spouse of a person present  and
       settled here.  The Respondent's sponsor is her husband  Mr  Gedi
       Ali.

Background and Matters in Issue

    2. The application had been considered with reference  to  Appendix
       FM of the Immigration Rules and refused on the  basis  that  the
       Respondent had not demonstrated that she  met  the  requirements
       set out in paragraph E-ECP 3.1.  It was  accepted  that  Mr  Ali
       earned �16,380 in his employment at the 'Maple Leaf Bakery'.  He
       had claimed to have additional income from 'Gees  Good  Grocery'
       which would take him over the threshold of  �18,600  per  annum,
       but the Entry Clearance Officer could not take evidence of  this
       into account, in essence because Mr Ali had been  working  there
       for less than 6 months.

    3. The First-tier Tribunal found as fact that Mr  Ali  was  earning
       the claimed �16,380 from Maple Leaf Bakery. The Judge could  not
       however be satisfied as to any earnings from Gees  Good  Grocery
       because of insufficient documentary  evidence.  The  appeal  was
       therefore dismissed under the Rules.    The  Judge  went  on  to
       consider Article 8.   She begins by setting out the key areas of
       enquiry identified by Lord Bingham in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27. She
       found that there was a family life and that the  decision  would
       interfere with it. It is noted that the sole reason for  refusal
       is the failure to meet the financial  requirements  set  out  in
       Appendix FM, provisions that were the subject of the  appeal  in
       MM and Others [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin).   Judge Boyes cites from
       the reasoning of  Blake  J  in  that  case  and  finds,  on  the
       "particular facts of this case", that  the  application  of  the
       minimum income requirements (in E-ECP 3.1)  are  an  unjustified
       and proportionate interference with the  parties'  Article  8(1)
       rights.  In addition to the 'MM point' the  Judge  identified  a
       number  of  other  factors  which  led  to  the  decision  being
       disproportionate: the Sponsor had come to the UK  as  a  refugee
       and could not return to Somalia (thus  precluding  married  life
       from continuing there); he had integrated into  British  society
       to the extent that he had a home and a job which he  would  lose
       if he had to go to Uganda; he  had  no  connection  with  Uganda
       himself and "would struggle  to  survive"  there.   Finally  the
       Judge had  considered  whether  it  would  be  proportionate  to
       require the Respondent to make a fresh application. Particularly
       relevant to that matter  was  the  fact  that  this  couple  had
       married as long ago as the 28th October 2010. An application for
       entry clearance soon after had failed because the Respondent was
       under 21 at the date of application, a provision under the Rules
       which was subsequently found to be unlawful by the Supreme Court
       in Quila [2011] UKSC 45.  But for that  unlawful  provision  the
       Respondent would have been granted entry clearance long ago.  In
       those circumstances the First-tier Tribunal did not consider any
       further delay to be reasonable or proportionate.

    4. The grounds of appeal are that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in
       failing to have regard to Gulshan [2013] UKUT  00640  (IAC)  and
       Nagre [2013] EWHC 720  (Admin).  There  was  no  regard  had  to
       whether there  was  a  good  arguable  case  for  proceeding  to
       consider Article 8.   Further the grounds take  issue  with  the
       conclusions reached by Blake J in MM  and  Ors.   Before  me  Mr
       Tarlow did not pursue these 'MM' grounds.





Error of Law

    5. It will rarely if ever be a material error of  law  to  fail  to
       specifically cite a case where it is clear that the Tribunal has
       applied the right principles.

    6. Mr Tarlow submitted that the entire Article 8 reasoning in  this
       case was flawed for failure to refer at the outset to the 'test'
       set out in Gulshan, Nagre and related cases.    The  grounds  of
       appeal state that 'test' to be  "that an  Article  8  assessment
       shall  only  be  carried   out   when   there   are   compelling
       circumstances not recognised by the Rules".  Its  is  also  said
       that "Gulshan makes it clear that at this stage an appeal should
       only be allowed where there are exceptional circumstances".   In
       granting permission to appeal Judge Hemingway observed that this
       somewhat misstates the position post-Gulshan.    She  cites  the
       guidance in full: "after applying the requirements of the Rules,
       only if there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to
       remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go
       on to consider whether there are  compelling  circumstances  not
       sufficiently recognised under them".  Whichever way you put  it,
       the point being made is that the way we approach Article  8  has
       changed since the statement of changes to the Immigration  Rules
       made on the 9th July 2012. That  is  because  on  that  day  the
       Secretary of State expressly sought to integrate Article 8  into
       the Rules, formulating new paragraphs which would reflect  where
       parliament considered the balance should be struck  between  the
       rights of the individual and the rights of the state.

    7. I am quite satisfied that Judge Boyes had directed her  mind  to
       that fact. She had clearly had regard to  the  decision  in  MM,
       which addresses such changes head on, and in fact sets  out  (at
       paragraph 90) the Secretary of State's own guidance  that  post-
       July  2012  positive   Article   8   decisions   must   identify
       "unjustifiably harsh consequences",  later  to  be  approved  in
       Gulshan and Nagre,  the  latter  decision  being  referenced  at
       paragraph 84 of MM.  The failure to refer in  terms  to  any  of
       these cases has not affected the decision, since it is  apparent
       that the Judge had in mind that there needed  to  be  particular
       factors which would render the decision unjustifiably harsh.  As
       I have set out above (at paragraph 3) she has identified those.

    8. There is no criticism of her proportionality balancing  exercise
       per se; if it accepted that the findings on proportionality were
       open to Judge Boyes it can hardly be said that there was  not  a
       "good arguable case" for going on to  consider  Article  8.   If
       there was an error in not expressly setting  out  the  dicta  in
       Gulshan it is not, in this case, such that the  decision  should
       be set aside.


Decision

    9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law
       and it is upheld.
