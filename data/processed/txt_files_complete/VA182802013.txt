                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Boutros Kwame Boadi is a Ghanaian citizen born on 20th  May  1995.   On
    19th August 2013 he applied for entry clearance to come to  the  United
    Kingdom for a period of three weeks as  a  visitor  to  stay  with  his
    uncle, the Sponsor named above.  In the interest of continuity  I  will
    refer in this determination to Mr Boadi as the Appellant and to the ECO
    as the Respondent, the titles by which they were known before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 2. The application was refused by the ECO on 11 September 2013.  He  noted
    that  the  Appellant  was  a  student  and  said  that  there  was   no
    satisfactory evidence  of  the  Appellant's  parents'  situation.   The
    application was refused as it  was  not  accepted  that  the  Appellant
    intended a genuine visit following which  he  would  return  to  Ghana.
    Maintenance and accommodation were also put  in  issue.   The  decision
    concluded by stating that the  right  of  appeal  was  limited  to  the
    grounds referred to in Section 84(1)(c) of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.  The Appellant appealed, lodging  various  further
    documents.  The Entry Clearance Manager reviewed the matter and  stated
    that the issue of maintenance was now accepted.  I  presume  that  also
    included  accommodation.  However  the  evidence  as  to  the  family's
    circumstances was not regarded as adequate and it was  noted  that  the
    Appellant had finished school and it was not clear what he intended  to
    do on completion of his studies.  The decision  would  not  breach  the
    ECHR.

 3. In the Notice of Appeal it was requested that  the  matter  be  decided
    without a hearing,  on  papers.   The  appeal  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Moore  at  the  Newport  Centre.   In  a  determination
    promulgated  on  22nd  May  2014  he  allowed  the  appeal  under   the
    Immigration Rules and made a whole fee award of ï¿½80 in  favour  of  the
    Appellant.

 4. The Respondent sought permission to appeal, asserting  that  the  judge
    had misdirected himself in law.  It was noted that  the  Appellant  had
    made his application on 19th August 2013 and that  on  25th  June  2013
    Section 52  of  the  Crime  and  Courts  Act  came  into  effect  which
    restricted the appeal  rights  for  visitors  coming  to  visit  family
    members in the UK and those restrictions  applied  to  any  application
    made on or after 25th June  2013.   Section  88A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 had been amended to remove a  right  of
    appeal for persons visiting specified  family  members  except  on  the
    residual grounds mentioned in Sections  84(1)(b)  and  (c),  namely  on
    human rights and race  relations  grounds.   The  judge  had  erred  in
    purporting to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules and had gone
    beyond his jurisdiction.  It was also stated that as the Appellant  was
    applying to visit his uncle he could not have benefited from a right of
    appeal under the Immigration Rules unless the application had been made
    prior to 9th July 2012, which it  was  not.   It  was  clear  from  the
    refusal notice that the right of appeal was limited.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Pooler on 12th June 2014.

 6. At the hearing before me I went through the application in some  detail
    with the Sponsor and  explained  the  changes  in  the  law  which  had
    occurred prior to the Appellant's application being made. It was  clear
    to me that the judge had exceeded his  jurisdiction  in  purporting  to
    allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules when there was no right of
    appeal on that basis.  I accordingly set aside his decision.

 7. Mr Bernieh on behalf of the Appellant then addressed me  in  connection
    with the remaking of the decision.  He claimed that  there  was  family
    life as between himself and the Appellant.   In  Ghanaian  society,  he
    said, the family structure was extended and he regarded  the  Appellant
    as part of his family.  He had always advised him.  The Appellant was a
    bright student and the Sponsor wanted to  support  him.   He  submitted
    that the decision was in breach of Article 8 ECHR.  He  also  said  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law as sufficient evidence  was
    before the ECO for the application to be granted, as was borne  out  by
    the fact that Judge Moore had allowed the appeal.   He  also  submitted
    that there was an element of racial discrimination.  All persons should
    be treated the same.  He said it was apparent from the  fact  that  the
    application had been refused that there  had  been  discrimination.   I
    pointed out that the Grounds of Appeal made only a passing reference to
    human rights and there was no reference to discrimination.  Mr  Bernieh
    responded that Article 14 was  relevant.   The  Appellant  had  been  a
    genuine visitor but a visa had not been granted.  His human rights were
    undermined and it was a classic example.

 8. In response Mr Smart pointed out that family life within the meaning of
    Article 8 was restricted.  Discrimination had not been  raised  in  the
    Grounds of Appeal which were before the judge.

 9. I now remake the decision in the light of the evidence  before  me  and
    the submissions made.

10. With regard to Article 8 I have to consider whether the  Appellant  has
    shown that family life exists between himself  and  the  Sponsor.   The
    Appellant lives in Ghana and the Sponsor in the  United  Kingdom.   The
    Appellant is an adult.  He lives with his parents in Ghana.  There  was
    no evidence that the Sponsor supports him in a  financial  manner  (the
    Appellant's case was that he was well provided for by his  parents)  or
    that he is dependent upon the Sponsor (as distinct  from  his  parents)
    for emotional support.  As Mr Smart had  pointed  out  the  concept  of
    family life for the terms of Article 8 is restricted.

11. Following established case law, in particular Kugathas  v  SSHD  [2003]
    EWA Civ 31 I find that although the Appellant and Sponsor  are  related
    there is no family life between them for the  purposes  of  Article  8.
    The decision under appeal therefore cannot breach the Appellant's right
    to family life.

12. With regard to private life the Appellant's private life  is  evidently
    centred on Ghana where he will have  friends  and  where  he  has  been
    pursuing his education.  He wished to come to see his uncle for a three
    week visit.  Whilst that would have been  a  pleasant  and  instructive
    experience the loss of  the  opportunity  to  pursue  it  is  far  from
    qualifying  as  an  interference  with  the  Appellant's  private  life
    protected by Article 8.  The restricted nature of Article 8  protection
    is illustrated in recent case law.  At paragraph 57 of Patel and Others
    v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 Lord Carnwath stated:

          "It is important to remember that  Article  8  is  not  a  general
         dispensing power.  It is to be distinguished from the Secretary  of
         State's discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules,
         which may be unrelated to any protected human right."

    He went on to comment that the opportunity for a promising  student  to
    complete his course in  this  country,  however  desirable  in  general
    terms,  was  not  a  right  protected  under  Article  8.   Given  such
    expressions of the limited reach of Article 8 it is quite apparent that
    the spending of a short holiday in another country with an uncle cannot
    come within the terms of Article 8.  As I find  Article  8  not  to  be
    engaged the Appellant cannot succeed on human rights  grounds.  Article
    14 cannot stand alone.

13. There was no claim of discrimination made in the Grounds of Appeal.  In
    any  case  there  was  no  evidence  before  me  of  any   element   of
    discrimination on a racial basis.  All that the Sponsor could point  to
    was the fact that the application had been refused when he thought that
    it should have been allowed.  There is no arguable merit in this point.

14. The Sponsor  also  sought  to  argue  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law as on the evidence the application should  have
    been granted.  This ground of appeal is not one available under Section
    84 of the 2002 Act.

15. The appeal therefore falls to be dismissed.  As  the  appeal  has  been
    dismissed there can be no fee award.

Decisions

The original determination contained a material error on a point of law  and
I have set it aside.

I have remade the decision and for the reasons set out above the  appeal  is
dismissed on all grounds.

As the appeal has been dismissed there can be no fee award made.
