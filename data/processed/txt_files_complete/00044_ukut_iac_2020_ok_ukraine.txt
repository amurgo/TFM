                            DECISION AND REASONS


Permission should not be granted on the grounds  as  pleaded  if  there  is,
quite apart from the grounds, a reason why the appeal would fail.



Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Lingam ('the Judge'), sent to the parties on 3 September 2019,
    by which the appellant's appeal against the decision of the  respondent
    to refuse to grant her international protection was dismissed.

Anonymity

 2. An anonymity order was issued by the Judge and no application was  made
    by the parties that it be set aside. We confirm the order  pursuant  to
    rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  in  the
    following terms:

         Unless the Upper Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise,  no  report
         of these proceedings or  any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall
         directly or indirectly identify the appellant  or  members  of  her
         family. This order applies to, amongst others,  the  appellant  and
         the respondent. Any failure to comply with this  order  could  give
         rise to contempt of court proceedings. We do so in order to avoid a
         likelihood of serious  harm  arising  to  the  appellant  from  the
         contents of her protection claim becoming known to the public.

Background

 3. The appellant is a national of  Ukraine  and  presently  aged  33.  She
    asserts that  she  clandestinely  entered  the  United  Kingdom  on  31
    December 2015. She was encountered by immigration  officers  during  an
    enforcement visit to a property in East London on 18 March 2019 and she
    claimed asylum four days later, asserting that she  possesses  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution at the hands of the  Ukrainian  authorities
    because she is a military draft evader.

 4. She states that she studied at a college between the ages of 15 and 18,
    obtaining a nursing diploma in 2004. In her interview she describes the
    three-year  course  as  covering  practical  tasks  such  as   applying
    dressings, taking blood and giving injections. As a  junior  nurse  she
    worked as a feldsher in her village, a role she details in her  witness
    statement to be  akin  to  a  doctor's  assistant.  Ms  Panagiotopoulou
    confirmed at the hearing that a feldsher is a health care  professional
    who provides various medical services limited  to  emergency  treatment
    and outpatient practice. In Ukraine, they provide primary  health  care
    at outpatient clinics in rural areas, where there are no other  primary
    care providers. By way of her undated witness statement  the  appellant
    details that she was not permitted to  undertake  any  task  without  a
    doctor being present, though she was 'able to go to people's houses  if
    someone has blood pressure and then I can give them an injection'.  She
    married at the age of 19 and had three children.  Whilst  on  maternity
    leave after the birth of her first child she  commenced  an  accounting
    diploma by means of distance learning as her nursing wages  were  poor.
    Her evidence  is  inconsistent  as  to  whether  she  qualified  as  an
    accountant. She returned to work as a nurse in her village in September
    2010 after her second period of maternity leave and  undertook  limited
    roles. Her marriage ended in 2014, whilst she  was  pregnant  with  her
    third child.

 5. She asserts that she received her first military call-up papers in  May
    2014 but as she was a single mother who was  pregnant  with  her  third
    child, she did not take any  steps  in  respect  of  the  call-up.  She
    received further call-up papers in December 2014, 3  months  after  the
    birth of her third child. As a qualified  nurse  she  was  required  to
    attend a local army office. On this occasion  she  contacted  the  army
    officer to explain her circumstances but was informed that  her  mother
    could look after the children.

 6. We observe that  the  respondent's  CPIN  'Ukraine:  Military  Service'
    version 5.0, dated October 2018, confirms the present compulsory  draft
    age for men as being between 20 and  27.  Women  with  military-related
    specialties and who are fit for military service in  terms  of  health,
    age and family status are 'included in the list of  registered  persons
    liable for military service'. The note details at  �3.10.1  that  women
    called up may include field doctors and nurses.

 7. The appellant states that she left Ukraine  in  April  2015,  initially
    travelling to Poland by car and then to France via  Belgium  by  plane,
    utilizing a Schengen visa. She then clandestinely entered this  country
    on 31 December 2015 hidden in a lorry. She  details  by  means  of  her
    witness statement that she claimed asylum 'straight away' consequent to
    her arrival but it was not 'logged' by the respondent until  after  she
    was encountered. This was clarified at the  hearing  to  the  appellant
    having seen a solicitor after her arrival, but not 'formally' attending
    the respondent's offices.

 8. She details that after her arrival in this country her mother  informed
    her that further call-up papers were sent  to  her  at  home,  dated  7
    October 2016, 7 November 2016 and 21 November 2016. Her mother received
    a summons requiring the appellant to attend court in December  2016  in
    relation to her failure to abide by her military call-up. According  to
    a court document presented to the respondent, on 12 December  2016  the
    appellant was found to be  subject  to  'Article  336  of  the  Law  on
    Preparedness   Activity   and   Mobilisation'   and   having   received
    mobilisation  certificates  she  was  found  guilty  of  having  evaded
    military  service.  She  was  sentenced  to  a  term  of   two   years'
    imprisonment.





Hearing before FtT

 9. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at Yarl's  Wood  on  8  August
    2019. At the hearing, the appellant relied upon a  letter  from  Viktor
    Nedokus, a lawyer in Ukraine, dated 29 July 2019.  The  translation  of
    the letter details:

         'On the provision of written clarifications with regard to  holding
         [O.K.] criminal liable, at the petition of the  defendant's  mother
         [M.T]


         I, Victor Ihorovych Nedokus, hereby  certify  in  writing  that  on
         15/11/2016, [M.V.], mother of [O.K.] applied with a request for the
         legal defence of her daughter in the court of the city of  Buchach.
         In conformity with Article 336 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, the
         accused broke the Law of Ukraine based  on  the  'Law  of  Military
         Service and Liability for Military Service', and in accordance with
         the above, had failed to appear before the court. I, as  a  lawyer,
         refused to act as her representative since [O.K.] broke the law  of
         the country.


         Also, on 23/12/2016, after the trial, [M.V.] addressed to me V.  I.
         Nedokus for appealing. After finding that [O.K.] is not staying  in
         the territory of Ukraine, I refused to defend her.'

10. The appellant also relied upon a report from Professor  Mark  Galeotti,
    Senior Associate Fellow with the Royal United Services Institute, dated
    30 June  2019.  Professor  Galeotti  expresses  his  best  professional
    assessment as being that the call-up papers, court determination and  a
    reference from the appellant's former employers are genuine, though  he
    observes a caveat as to the court document which mentions 'Article  336
    of the Law on Preparedness Activity and Mobilisation'. He observes that
    there is no such article 336, though the text accurately describes  the
    law. He suggests that this might be a typographical error.

11. The Judge found several inconsistences  in  the  appellant's  evidence,
    including as to her history of employment. Her answers as to  what  she
    learned on her nursing course were 'so non-specific' that  despite  the
    wide range of study areas arising in a three year course she could only
    say that she had 'lessons and then ... went to a hospital  ...  present
    at operations ... had practice ... main thing is how to take blood from
    a vein'. As to her general medical knowledge, her answers at  interview
    identified an inability to identify  normal  blood  pressure  readings,
    normal resting heartbeat or even competent knowledge as to the  working
    of arteries. The Judge found,  to  the  requisite  standard,  that  the
    appellant is not a qualified medical nurse or practitioner and so  does
    not fall into a category of female medical worker  who  is  liable  for
    military service. In such circumstances, she will  not  be  subject  to
    call-up and so possesses no well-founded fear of persecution  upon  her
    return to Ukraine.

12. The Judge considered the  issue  of  call-up  and  prosecution  in  the
    alternative, with  the  appellant  being  a  qualified  female  medical
    worker. She was satisfied that the postponement of military call-up for
    a single mother, permitted under the Law of Ukraine  on  Military  Duty
    and Military Service, Part 1, Article 17, detailed  at  �4.2.1  of  the
    October 2018 CPIN, was  applicable  in  the  circumstances.  The  Judge
    concluded  at  [86]  that  the  appellant  has  not  been  subject   to
    prosecution in absentia and would not be prosecuted upon return:

         'The following is a consideration of  the  evidence  taken  at  its
         highest. The evidence in VB and Others supports the view that it is
         highly  unlikely  that  even  as  a  draft  evader,  she  would  be
         prosecuted. In the unlikely case she  was  to  be  prosecuted,  the
         probability would be that she would face  a  financial  penalty.  I
         consider that even if the country  guidance  considers  the  prison
         conditions in Ukraine breach article 3 ECHR, it  is  very  unlikely
         that as a single parent of three young children  that  a  custodial
         sentence would be imposed on her. Besides, there is no  claim  that
         she suffers  from  any  health  issues  that  would  aggravate  her
         circumstances either whilst awaiting a re-trial or prosecution.'

Decision on error of law

13. In the country guidance decision of VB and Another (draft  evaders  and
    prison conditions) Ukraine CG [2017] UKUT 00079 (IAC) it was held  that
    it is not reasonably likely that a draft-evader  avoiding  conscription
    or mobilisation  in  Ukraine  would  face  criminal  or  administrative
    proceedings  for  that  act,  although  if  a  draft-evader  did   face
    prosecution proceedings the Criminal Code of Ukraine does  provide,  in
    Articles 335, 336 and 409, that a custodial sentence may be imposed for
    such an offence. It is a matter for any Tribunal to  consider,  in  the
    light of developing evidence, whether  there  are  aggravating  matters
    which may lead to the imposition of an  immediate  custodial  sentence,
    rather than a  suspended  sentence  or  the  matter  proceeding  as  an
    administrative offence and a fine being sought  by  a  prosecutor.  The
    Tribunal further found that there  is  a  real  risk  of  anyone  being
    returned to Ukraine as a convicted criminal  sentenced  to  a  term  of
    imprisonment in that country being detained on arrival, although anyone
    convicted in absentia  would  probably  be  entitled  thereafter  to  a
    retrial in accordance with Article 412 of the Criminal  Procedure  Code
    of Ukraine.

14. A Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  granted  permission  on  all  seven
    grounds of appeal drafted by  counsel  who  represented  the  appellant
    before the Judge. We take this opportunity to observe that the  grounds
    were not drafted by Ms. Panagiotopoulou.  The  complaints  are  varied,
    ranging from a purported failure by  the  Judge  to  come  to  a  clear
    finding as to whether the appellant worked as a feldsher in Ukraine  to
    an asserted failure to  lawfully  take  into  consideration  an  expert
    report. The criticisms are primarily directed at  the  Judge's  adverse
    findings  as  to  the  appellant's  employment  in  Ukraine   and   her
    prosecution in absentia. We observe that there was no challenge to  the
    Judge's finding in the alternative at [86] that even if  the  appellant
    was subject to a prosecution for draft evasion,  it  is  very  unlikely
    that as a single parent of three young children she would be  subjected
    to a custodial sentence. Noting the problem that faced her  as  to  the
    express  failure  to  challenge  the  finding  of  fact  at  [86]   Ms.
    Panagiotopoulou submitted that there was  an  'implicit'  challenge  to
    this paragraph of the decision  identifiable  within  ground  6,  which
    states:

         'At paragraph 80 and  82,  the  Judge  has  erred  in  law  in  her
         alternative  argument  that  even  if  the   appellant   had   been
         prosecuted, she would be entitled to a retrial and would  thus  not
         be at risk. The country guidance case of VB made it  clear  that  a
         person prosecuted in their absence would be apprehended  on  return
         at the airport [103]; that even  if  entitled  to  a  retrial,  the
         individual would be held in a  pre-trial  detention  centre  (SIZO)
         pending the hearing [54]; that a person who has previously run away
         is not likely to get bail [104]; and that there is a real  risk  of
         ill-treatment during this time. Thus. The Judge  is  clearly  wrong
         that even if the appellant is apprehended, she will not be at risk.
         '

15. In considering Ms. Panagiotopoulou's  submissions  as  to  an  implicit
    challenge to a  different  paragraph  being  identifiable  within  this
    ground, we commence on the basis  that  this  Tribunal  will  expect  a
    professional representative to  set  out  grounds  of  appeal  with  an
    appropriate degree of particularity and legibility. When examining this
    ground, it is clear to us that [80] and [82] comprise at their core  an
    observation  as  to  the  relevant  Country  Guidance  decision  and  a
    subsequent comment as to it being unclear why  the  appellant's  mother
    did not approach a  second  lawyer  when  seeking  representation.  The
    author of the grounds has erroneously sought to elevate the observation
    and comment into findings of fact. We are satisfied that this ground of
    appeal, which proceeds on the basis that having  been  sentenced  to  a
    custodial term the appellant would be  detained  on  return,  does  not
    implicitly engage with the findings made at [86] that even when  taking
    the  evidence  presented  at  its  highest,  the  appellant's  personal
    circumstances are such that she could not establish  to  the  requisite
    standard that if she were a draft evader she would be  prosecuted,  and
    if in the unlikely case she were to be prosecuted,  as  the  mother  of
    three  young  children  that  she  would  not  receive  a  sentence  of
    imprisonment.  Consequently,  the  appellant  has  not  challenged  the
    alternative finding at [86] establishing that she does  not  possess  a
    well-founded fear of persecution on her return to Ukraine and therefore
    this appeal must fail.

16. We observe that when considering applications for permission to  appeal
    to this Tribunal, judges must give  careful  consideration  to  whether
    there is any, or any meritorious, challenge to an alternative basis for
    refusing or allowing an appeal as the absence of  such  challenge  will
    normally be determinative as to the prospect of success.

17. We address the remaining grounds  relied  upon  briefly.  Ground  1  is
    misconceived,  seeking  to  elevate  comments  and  observations   into
    findings of fact. The Judge did not accept that  the  appellant  was  a
    qualified nurse or nursing practitioner. She makes a number of  adverse
    credibility findings as to the appellant's employment  at  [54],  [55],
    [57] and [58] of the decision. At [52] the Judge is clearly noting  the
    evidence  before  her  as  to  the  appellant's  nursing  studies   and
    commenting that the proffered  explanation  is  'not  straightforward'.
    This is a comment and not a finding of fact. The Judge again  considers
    the appellant's evidence at [53], this time as to her employment  as  a
    feldsher. Contrary to the assertion made within ground 1, the Judge  is
    simply noting the evidence presented and is  not  making  a  favourable
    finding of fact. At [56] the Judge is considering evidence  purportedly
    authored by the appellant's former hospital employer and  accepts  that
    if she were working in her claimed role her earnings  would  have  been
    low. This is clearly not  a  finding  that  she  was  so  employed,  as
    evidenced by observations earlier  in  the  paragraph  as  to  'if  her
    account of employment were true ...' and 'whilst on maternity leave for
    four years (if true) ...' Contrary to  the  assertion  at  [5]  of  the
    grounds the Judge unequivocally found at [61] that the appellant is not
    a qualified nurse. Her finding at [60] is that the  appellant's  stated
    role was no more than being an assistant to a doctor  engaged  in  non-
    medical duties. Having made such finding of fact, the  appellant  could
    not satisfy the field doctors and nurses category  established  in  the
    list of registered persons liable for military service.

18. The Judge was entitled to consider the evidence presented in the round,
    and the evidence of Professor Galeotti is limited to his  consideration
    of scanned copies of the call-up papers, hospital reference  and  court
    document, the latter being subject to a  significant  caveat.  However,
    the grounds are not accurate in asserting at [9] that the Judge  placed
    'no weight' on Professor Galeotti's evidence. She confirmed at [77]  of
    her decision that she placed 'little'  weight  on  it  because  of  her
    finding at [76] that the appellant's evidence as to being  informed  by
    her mother in 2015, whilst she was  in  France,  that  authorities  had
    visited the family home seeking her to attend court for draft  evasion,
    but the final three  call-up  papers  were  dated  7  October  2016,  7
    November 2016 and 21 November 2016.  On  her  own  evidence  they  were
    issued whilst the authorities were seeking to prosecute her.  This  led
    to the Judge concluding  that  the  appellant  was  simply  making  her
    account up as she went along. When  considering  the  evidence  in  the
    round, we conclude that the Judge was entitled to give  limited  weight
    to Professor Galeotti's opinion as to the genuineness of the  documents
    in light of  the  vagueness  and  significant  inconsistencies  in  her
    evidence as to her employment and prosecution.

19. We are satisfied that the Judge's  approach  to  the  letter  from  Mr.
    Nedokus was  lawful.  We  have  found  this  document  to  be  entirely
    unimpressive. On its face, a  member  of  the  Ukrainian  National  Bar
    Association refused to represent the appellant  at  her  trial  because
    'she broke the law of the  country',  in  circumstances  where  he  was
    capable of advancing significant mitigation on her behalf such  as  her
    being a single mother of three young children. The position adopted  by
    Mr. Nedokus as to his unwillingness to attend and present mitigation in
    the face of a potential custodial sentence for  draft  evasion  appears
    not only contrary to his professional role but also in  stark  contrast
    to the situation identified by  the  Tribunal  in  VB,  at  [67],  when
    considering the  circumstances  in  Ukraine  around  the  time  of  the
    appellant's purported trial, namely that the  imposition  of  custodial
    sentences for draft evasion was rare:

         'We lack a straight-forward set of official statistics on the issue
         but information obtained by the FCO, UNHCR and newspapers indicates
         only a couple of persons would appear to have actually been sent to
         prison for conscription or mobilisation evasion, with  evidence  of
         suspended sentences, probation or  fines  in  only  tens  of  other
         cases.'


20. A further concern as to the reliability of the letter is  that  despite
    having informed the appellant's mother that he would not represent  her
    daughter  at  her  trial  because  she  'broke  the  law',  her  mother
    unsuccessfully returned and sought to instruct him  in  respect  of  an
    appeal. No reasonable judge could place any weight on this  problematic
    document, which we consider to be wholly unreliable.

21. Ground 4 suffers from the same difficulty as ground 1 as the author  of
    the grounds seeks to  elevate  observations  made  by  the  Judge  when
    considering the evidence  before  her  into  credibility  findings.  We
    observe that Ms. Panagiotopoulou did not pursue this ground  before  us
    beyond simply relying upon its content. The Judge was simply addressing
    the appellant's evidence in the round and sifting it to  identify  what
    weight to give to various strands. Her comments on  peripheral  matters
    were no more than that.

22. The evidence from the appellant's mother is limited in nature.  At  its
    highest it details that she received three military call-up  papers  on
    behalf of her daughter and a court summons. She details that she sought
    to instruct Mr. Nedokus. Whilst the Judge gives  limited  consideration
    to the mother's evidence, we are satisfied  that  it  is  incapable  of
    establishing the appellant's case when considered in the round with the
    other evidence presented in  this  matter,  including  the  appellant's
    evidence.   The   appellant's   evidence    suffers    from    numerous
    inconsistencies, her knowledge as to nursing is  severely  limited  and
    she is unable to provide specific evidence as to her three-year nursing
    course. The court determination relied upon refers  to  a  non-existent
    criminal law provision and the letter  from  Mr.  Nedokus  is  entirely
    unreliable.

23. Ms. Panagiotopoulou appropriately withdrew ground 7 at the hearing. The
    Judge observed the appellant's failure to seek international protection
    in Poland, Belgium or France as she travelled to the United Kingdom and
    further noted her failure to claim asylum in this country  for  several
    years. The Judge gave lawful reasons for not accepting the  appellant's
    explanation  for  such  delay  in  approaching   the   United   Kingdom
    authorities for asylum and these detailed reasons are  not  challenged.
    As Ms. Panagiotopoulou accepted before us, section 8 of the Asylum  and
    Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 was  'in  play'  in
    this matter.

24. For these reasons, this appeal must fail.
