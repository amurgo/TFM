Turkey -  adjudicators- proper findings

Representatives
Ms N Nnamani  of  Counsel  instructed  by  Howe  &  Co  Solicitors  for  the
appellant; Ms C Hanrahan  for the respondent.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
1. This case is reported in order to reiterate yet again the  necessity  for
adjudicators in Turkish cases  to  make  properly  reasoned  and  clear  and
consistent findings of fact.  The  appellant,  a  national  of  Turkey,  has
appealed with leave of the Tribunal against a determination of  Adjudicator,
Mr J D L  Edwards,  dismissing  the  appeal  against  the  decision  by  the
respondent giving directions for removal following refusal to grant  asylum.



2. By his glaring failure to make proper findings of  fact  the  Adjudicator
in this case has given us little choice but to remit. At paragraph 25  first
four lines he stated that he did not find the appellant's  account  credible
and at sub paragraph 25 (g) he added that by virtue of there being "so  many
unlikely features  to  his  account"  he  could  not  even  accept  "certain
aspects" of his case. Yet in the body of paragraph 25 and  at  paragraph  28
he then appeared to accept, on the basis of no reasons whatsoever, that  the
appellant was a HADEP supporter who had vague links, albeit quite old,  with
the PKK and who had been arrested and detained on three  occasions.  Despite
earlier appearing to doubt whether the appellant's claimed brothers were  in
fact his brothers, he then went  on  to  consider  the  relevance  of  their
evidence on the basis that they were in fact  his  brothers.  Possibly  that
might have been a valid step had he then examined  their  evidence  -  which
showed that two of them had been accorded refugee status -  adequately;  but
in fact he did not.

3. Then at paragraph 28 he said: "There is no  evidence  of  any  particular
surveillance targeted on him...He remained in the country for a  long  time,
with his identity being checked by the  authorities  without  attempting  to
leave". His reference here to "[n]o  evidence"  is  extremely  difficult  to
square  with  the  appellant's  witness  statement   evidence,   which   the
Adjudicator himself inaccurately touched upon at paragraph 18. This  was  to
the effect that he had been subject after his last  release  from  detention
to continuous searches of his cafï¿½, raids on his house  and  questioning  on
the street.

4.  The  difficulty  raised  by  the  Adjudicator's  mixture  of  unreasoned
acceptance of key parts of the appellant's  account  with  poorly  explained
rejection of other key parts is that if the appellant's case  was  taken  at
its highest and it were accepted that  there  had  indeed  continued  to  be
continuous harassment of him by the authorities, he might  have  been  able,
at least arguably, to succeed under  the  criteria  set  out  in  ACDOG.  In
addition Miss Nnamani had adduced recent documentary  evidence  which  might
be relevant to a consideration of whether the Tribunal  determination  in  O
[2004] UKIAT 00038  (dealing with  the  GBST  system)  fully  reflected  the
recording systems that would exist in respect  of  someone  who  (like  this
appellant) had been fingerprinted. Miss Nnamani said she  would  be  content
with a remittal in this case,  but  her  submissions  in  respect  of  these
materials do merit further consideration at the remitted hearing.

5. We can only hope that the next Adjudicator will pay rather more  heed  to
the Tribunal's frequent warning about the need for adjudicators  in  Turkish
cases to make proper findings of fact: see ACDOG [2003]  UKIAT  00034  paras
40-41 and [2003] 00072 U (Turkey). Presumably the all too common failure  to
make proper findings arises out of a  belief  that,  even  if  a  claimant's
account is largely or fully accepted, it can be said that a claimant is  not
at risk on return  in  any  event.  In  our  view  that  is  rarely  a  safe
assumption to make in Turkish cases; and, in the context of  Turkish  cases,
the general advice against making "even if" findings contained in the  Court
of Appeal judgment in He [2002] Imm A R 590  continues  to  have  particular
force.

6. For the above reasons the appeal is allowed to  the  extent  that  it  is
remitted in accordance with Rule 22 of the Immigration  and  Asylum  Appeals
(Procedure) Rules 2003 to be heard by an adjudicator other than  Mr  J  D  L
Edwards.

                                                              VICE-PRESIDENT
