Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr H Kannagara of Counsel instructed by Paul John &
                    Company Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of Mauritius.  The  first  named  appellant
    was born on [ ] 1976 and she is the mother of the second appellant  who
    was born on [ ] 1988.  A reference hereinafter to the  appellant  is  a
    reference to the first named appellant.

2.   The appellant was granted leave to enter the UK  as  a  student  on  26
    June 2006 and has remained as a student with  leave  until  15  October
    2014.  Her daughter arrived in April 2008 as the appellant's  dependant
    and her leave has been  extended  in  line.   On  7  October  2014  the
    appellants applied for further leave  to  remain.   These  applications
    were refused on 10 March 2015.  The appellant had not submitted a valid
    Confirmation of Acceptance for  Studies.   The  appellant's  daughter's
    application was refused.

3.   The appellants  appealed  and  their  appeals  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Hembrough on 29 September 2015.  At that hearing it  was
    accepted that the appellants could not succeed under  the  points-based
    system there being no Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies.

4.   Having heard the oral evidence from both appellants the judge  recorded
    that the appellants' representative submitted:

         "that  whether  considered  under  paragraph  276ADE  (1)  (iv)  or
         paragraph EX.1 (cc) of Appendix FM or Section 117B (6) of the  2002
         Act the outcome of the appeal was likely to turn on my  finding  as
         to whether it was reasonable to expect the  second  appellant,  who
         has been here lawfully for 7 years and is thus a qualifying  child,
         to leave the UK, having regard to the obligation imposed by Section
         55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009  to
         safeguard and promote her welfare."

5.   The judge records his agreement with that submission but noted he  must
    first  make  some  preliminary  findings  in  relation  to  the  second
    appellant's mother.  The determination continues:

         "32. It was not argued on her  behalf  that  there  would  be  very
             significant obstacles  to  her  re-integration  into  life  in
             Mauritius where she has spent most of her life and  where  she
             has family residing, and I so find.  She was formerly employed
             as a teacher.  She has worked as a teacher in the UK where she
             has  also  been  studying.   Her  knowledge  and  skills   are
             therefore current and it is reasonable to infer that she  will
             have references available to her.  In the  absence  of  expert
             evidence to the contrary I reject her evidence that she  would
             have difficulty in finding employment because of her age  (39)
             and lack of connection.


         33.  I also reject her evidence that she would have nowhere to live
             and would be without support on return.  Her parents  and  her
             brother live in Mauritius and it is reasonable to expect  that
             they might provide support at least  in  the  short  term.   I
             assume that there is also a family home  there  but  I  accept
             that given her estrangement for her husband this  may  not  be
             available to her.


         34.  Of perhaps more importance  however  is  the  fact  that  when
             making her application she submitted a Lloyds  Bank  statement
             for an account in her name  with  a  credit  balance  of  over
             �17,000 at 4 September 2014.  Information in the public domain
             indicates this to be many times the  average  annual  wage  in
             Mauritius.  The bank statement also shows a transfer of  �2000
             from another account in her name  which  would  indicate  that
             other funds are also available  to  her.   I  find  that  upon
             return she has the skills and experience to be able to  obtain
             employment and sufficient funds available to  accommodate  and
             maintain herself (and her daughter) to an acceptable  standard
             while she looks for work.


         35.  For the avoidance of doubt therefore I dismiss any  appeal  by
             the first Appellant based on paragraph 276ADE (1) (vi) of  the
             Immigration Rules.


         36.  As she and her daughter fail to be removed together there will
             be no interference in their family life inter se.  Having been
             here since 2006 and having regard  to  the  low  threshold  of
             engagement I accept that she has established  a  private  life
             that potentially engages the protection  of  Article  8  ECHR.
             However in light of my above findings I am satisfied that  her
             removal is in  accordance  with  the  law  and,  absent  other
             factors, necessary for the economic welfare of the country."

6.   The judge considered the provisions of Section 117B  of  the  2002  Act
    which he sets out in paragraph  37  of  the  decision  and  noted  that
    Parliament had stated that the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    control was in the public interest.  The appellant had accepted in  her
    evidence that she had come as a  student  for  temporary  purposes  and
    could have had no legitimate expectation that she or her daughter would
    be allowed to remain unless they could satisfy some requirement of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Little weight should be given to any  private  life
    established by her while her immigration status  was  precarious.   The
    judge  observed  that  considering  the  first  appellant's  appeal  in
    isolation "I would have no hesitation in holding that  her  removal  is
    necessary and proportionate to the legitimate aim already  identified."



7.   Having rejected an application by the appellants'  representative  that
    the matter be remitted to the Secretary of State  the  judge  concluded
    that he was sufficiently informed to make an assessment in relation  to
    the second appellant's best interest.  He referred to Section 55 and ZH
    (Tanzania) v Secretary of State [2011] UKSC.  He then directed  himself
    by reference to subsequent authorities and the determination  continues
    as follows:

         "48. Put shortly it was submitted that the  removal  of  the  first
             appellant to Mauritius with her mother would  be  contrary  to
             her best interests because the level of integration  that  she
             has achieved in the  UK  and  her  lack  of  familiarity  with
             Mauritian culture and the  potential  adverse  effect  on  her
             mental health.


         49.  The cases do not decide that a child's period of residence for
             more than 7 years should result  in  the  grant  of  leave  to
             remain.   Length  of  residence  is  simply  a  factor  to  be
             considered as part of a holistic assessment of best interests.
              I note the finding in MK (best interests  of  child)  Nigeria
             [2011] UKUT 00475 (IAC) that factors relating  to  the  public
             interest in the maintenance of effective  immigration  control
             should not form part  of  the  best  interests  of  the  child
             consideration.


         50.  The starting point for consideration is that it is in the best
             interests of a child to live with and be brought up by his  or
             her parents in the cultural environment to  which  he  or  she
             belongs.  I am satisfied that this is so in this appeal.


         51.  The second Appellant is not  a  British  citizen.   She  is  a
             Mauritian citizen with an entitlement to  all  of  the  rights
             appurtenant  to  such  citizenship.   Mauritius   is   not   a
             'struggling, impoverished and  plague  stricken  West  African
             state' as was the case in MK (section 55 -  Tribunal  options)
             Sierra Leone [2015] UKUT 00223 (IAC).   It  is  a  Westernised
             tourist destination albeit with a distinct culture of its own.
              There was no evidence before me from which I  could  conclude
             that the culture or the environment would be so alien  to  the
             second Appellant as to present substantial  obstacles  to  her
             integration.  I note that she spent the first 9 years  of  her
             life there and the next 8  years  living  with  her  Mauritian
             family in the UK.


         52.  Whilst no background country information was  relied  upon  by
             the Appellants I am aware from having decided other appeals in
             relation to  Mauritius  that  its  citizens  have  freedom  of
             religion, expression  and  movement.   Education  to  tertiary
             level  and  health  care  are   free.    There   are   several
             universities and places of higher learning whose  courses  and
             qualifications are accredited by universities in the UK.


         53.  I have found that the first Appellant is capable of supporting
             her  daughter  to  an  acceptable  standard  upon  return   to
             Mauritius where the second  Appellant's  father,  grandparents
             and wider family reside.  It is also reasonable in my view  to
             expect that the  first  Appellant  would  seek  some  form  of
             financial contribution from her  husband  for  her  daughter's
             maintenance.


         54.  The second Appellant is presently in  the  first  year  of  an
             elective and modular course in fashion design in  the  UK  and
             there was no reliable evidence before me  that  she  would  be
             unable to undertake a similar course in Mauritius.  When asked
             about this her evidence was that she had made no enquiry.


         55.  The primary languages spoken  in  Mauritius  are  English  and
             French and these are the media of tuition in the  schools  and
             universities.  There is therefore no  barrier  to  the  second
             Appellant's academic advancement.  There was no evidence  that
             she would be unable to engage in the same  range  of  sporting
             activities in Mauritius as in the UK.


         56.  I accept that she has a network of friends in the UK including
             a boyfriend although I was told  nothing  of  his  immigration
             status and he did  not  give  evidence  or  submit  a  witness
             statement.


         57.  If she is removed to Mauritius  with  her  mother  there  will
             inevitably be some disruption to  her  relationships  but  the
             reality is that as her education and her life  progresses  she
             will have to grow and adapt, learn new  skills  and  establish
             new friendships and relationships and there are in my view  no
             obstacles preventing her from doing this  in  Mauritius.   She
             can maintain her relationships in the UK by  means  of  modern
             communications media and possibly visits.  In  due  course  it
             may be possible for her to return to the UK as a student."

    The judge then refers to documents submitted by  the  second  appellant
    and found that it was clear that she had had  a  volatile  relationship
    with both of her parents but that no intervention or support  had  been
    contemplated or required after June 2014.  He was also  referred  to  a
    letter from the  Tower  Hamlets  Child  and  Adolescent  Mental  Health
    Services team (CAMHS) dated 16 September 2015 which details the effects
    on  the  appellant  of  the  consequences  of  the  breakdown  in   the
    relationship between her parents.

8.   The judge, having looked at the documents in the round, found  that  it
    was  clear  that  the  second  appellant  had  suffered  a  degree   of
    psychological distress and depression arising from the breakdown of her
    parents' relationship.  He continued: this particular  driver  has  now
    disappeared  although  her  evidence  was  she  maintains  intermittent
    contact with her father.  With  the  support  of  her  mother  and  the
    various mental health and young people's services available in  the  UK
    she has now made a good recovery."

9.   The determination concludes as follows:

         "62. She is now extremely  concerned  about  the  prospect  of  her
             removal to Mauritius.  This is in my view entirely natural and
             understandable.  I  have  found  that  there  are  no  social,
             cultural, financial or educational factors that would indicate
             that her removal  would  be  contrary  to  the  obligation  to
             safeguard and promote  her  welfare.   She  will  continue  to
             benefit from her mother's support on return.


         63.  I find the reference in the CAMHS letter to her being  'highly
             vulnerable to change' to be perplexing.  She is a 17� year old
             girl on the verge of womanhood.  Change is part of  her  life.
             Setting aside the breakdown of her parents'  relationship  she
             has recently changed schools.  She will change  again  if  she
             progresses  to  university.   This  may  involve   relocation,
             independent living  and  making  a  new  set  of  friends  and
             associations in the process.  When she  enters  the  world  of
             work her circumstances will  change  again.   As  regards  her
             network in the UK there was no evidence before me  as  to  the
             nature and extent of that network and the reality is that very
             few people  maintain  their  close  school/college  ties  into
             adulthood.


         64.  When giving her evidence I  find  that  the  second  Appellant
             displayed a degree of petulance which also comes across in her
             letter to the Tribunal.  She has clearly set her mind  against
             a return to  Mauritius.   Whilst,  given  her  background,  it
             possible that she may require  some  professional  support  in
             coping with the natural and understandable distress caused  by
             the transition in the short term, it is in my view  reasonable
             to expect her to access such  services  as  are  available  in
             Mauritius.  If she was suffering from a physical  disease  for
             which treatment was available in Mauritius  it  could  not  be
             suggested that it would be contrary to her best  interests  to
             do so.  The 2011 WHO Mental Health  Atlas  records  that  free
             mental health care provision is available in Mauritius.


         65.  The best interests of the children are a primary consideration
             not the primary consideration and have to be balanced  against
             the requirements of immigration control  and  looking  at  the
             evidence before me in the round I find that I  have  not  been
             satisfied that requiring the second  Appellant  to  return  to
             Mauritius with her mother would be contrary to the  obligation
             to safeguard and promote her welfare so as to place the UK  in
             breach of its obligations under Section 55 of the 2009 Act  or
             Article 8 ECHR.  To put it another way I am satisfied that  it
             is reasonable to expect her to leave the UK."

10.  The judge accordingly dismissed the appeal both under  the  Immigration
    Rules and on human rights grounds.

11.  The appellants applied for permission  to  appeal  and  permission  was
    granted by the First-tier Tribunal on 23 April 2016  on  the  following
    point:

         "Given the finding that the second appellant was lawfully  resident
         in the UK for seven years and was a  qualifying  child  ...  it  is
         arguable that Judge Hembrough may have erred materially in  law  in
         the consideration of Section 117B(6) of the NIA 2002  (as  amended)
         and the best interests of the second appellant (see PD  and  Others
         (Sri Lanka) [2016] UKUT 108)."

12.  The respondent filed a response on  4  May  2016  contending  that  the
    judge  had  considered  all  relevant  factors  in  relation  to   both
    appellants including the age, length of residence, ties and  impact  of
    removal on the second appellant.  He had given proper consideration  to
    all relevant factors in light of the best interests of  the  child  and
    had given proper reasons for finding that  return  was  reasonable  for
    both appellants.

13.  Mr Kannagara  submitted  that  the  only  issue  was  the  question  of
    reasonableness in relation to the second appellant who had  spent  over
    seven years in the United  Kingdom  lawfully.   Although  Mr  Kannagara
    acknowledged that the judge had  referred  to  relevant  case  law  and
    legislation, he had erred in  paragraph  65  of  the  determination  in
    finding as he did.  If the appeal of  the  second  appellant  had  been
    allowed the first named appellant could also have remained with her  in
    the United Kingdom.  The judge had erred in applying less weight to the
    second appellant and what she had done  in  the  UK.   She  had  needed
    mental health treatment  and  support  and  Mr  Kannagara  referred  to
    paragraph 61 and the reference to the second appellant having  suffered
    a  degree  of  psychological  distress  and  depression  following  the
    breakdown of the parental relationship.  The letter from the CAMHS team
    was a crucial document which the judge had not accepted.  He had  erred
    in giving insufficient weight to this letter.  He  had  also  erred  in
    referring to the need for short term support in Mauritius in  paragraph
    64.  It was not clear why he had reached the opinion that support would
    only be needed in the short term.

14.  The appellant had arrived as a 9 year old at a  crucial  point  in  her
    life and had been at  school  and  was  now  at  college.   She  was  a
    qualifying child and it was not in the public interest to  remove  her.
    She had gone through a difficult period following her parents' divorce.
     The case of PD and Others had not been available at the  time  of  the
    judge's decision and the facts were very similar.  The  child  in  that
    case was younger.

15.  The appellant had said in her statement  that  she  knew  little  about
    Mauritius and the judge had materially erred in law.

16.  Mr Tarlow submitted there was no material error of law.  The  issue  of
    weight to be given to a particular matter was a question for the First-
    tier Judge.  The judge had noted the length of residence  correctly  in
    paragraphs 62 to 65 of the decision.  He had made findings open to  him
    and the grounds were no more than an expression  of  disagreement  with
    the judge's conclusions.

17.  In reply Mr Kannagara argued that in view of the appellants' length  of
    residence the judge should have found in their favour  and  the  second
    appellant needed professional help and removal was unreasonable.

18.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the judge's decision  if  it  was
    flawed in law.

19.  The judge directed himself by reference to  the  authorities  available
    to him and the case of PD (Sri Lanka) was heard and  promulgated  after
    the judge's decision.  In that case  the  Tribunal  decided  that  when
    considering Article 8 claims of multiple family members:

         "Decision-makers should first apply the Immigration Rules  to  each
         individual applicant and, if appropriate, then consider  Article  8
         outside  the  Rules.  This  exercise  will  typically  entail   the
         consideration and determination of all claims  jointly,  so  as  to
         ensure that all material facts and considerations  are  taken  into
         account in each case."

20.  I note that in paragraph 40 of PD (Sri Lanka) the  Tribunal  stated  as
    follows:

         "Judicial decision making in the sphere of immigration  and  asylum
         law  is  rarely  straightforward.   The  present  appeals  are   no
         exception in this respect.  We consider that the application of the
         reasonableness test involves a balance of all  material  facts  and
         considerations.  The application of this test  will  invariably  be
         intensely fact sensitive, see EB (Kosovo)  v Secretary of State for
         the Home Department [2008]  UKHL  41,  at  [7]  -  [12],  per  Lord
         Bingham.  ..."

21.  This was a case in which  the  appellants'  advocate  had  invited  the
    judge to concentrate on the question of whether it  was  reasonable  to
    expect the second appellant to leave the United Kingdom but  the  judge
    expressly stated that he  should  make  some  preliminary  findings  in
    relation to the child's mother.  In other words he looked at the family
    in the holistic manner commended by the Tribunal in the case of PD (Sri
    Lanka).  Having considered the position of the mother and the statutory
    provisions it appears to me that the judge gave very careful  attention
    to the position of both parties and had full regard to  the  period  of
    residence of the appellant in the United Kingdom, noting that  she  had
    spent the first nine years of her life in Mauritius and the next  eight
    years with her Mauritian family in the UK.

22.  The judge had the benefit if hearing oral evidence from both  witnesses
    and it is quite clear that  he  gave  the  evidence  full  and  careful
    scrutiny.  He also had regard to the documentary evidence and I do  not
    find that he misdirected himself in  referring  to  that  evidence  and
    summarising the effect of it in paragraph  61  of  his  decision.   His
    comments on the CAMHS letter in paragraph 63 of the decision were  open
    to him.  As Mr Tarlow submits the complaints  about  the  determination
    are in reality no more than an expression of disagreement with findings
    of fact conscientiously made by a judge who had full regard to all  the
    material before him giving it such weight as he deemed appropriate.   I
    do not find that his approach would or might have been different had he
    had the benefit of the guidance of the Tribunal in the case of PD  (Sri
    Lanka).

23.  For the reasons I have given this appeal is dismissed and  the  judge's
    decision is confirmed.  The judge made an anonymity order which  it  is
    appropriate should be continued.




Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.



TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The judge made no fee award and I make none.
