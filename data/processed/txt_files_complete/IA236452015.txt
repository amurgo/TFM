               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Komolafe, Solicitor of Stella Maris Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Hanes made
    following a hearing at Taylor House on 17th November 2016.

 2. The appellant had applied for a residence card as a confirmation  of  a
    right to reside in the UK as the  extended  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national but was refused on  11th  March  2015.   The  judge  concluded
    following the decision in Sala (EFMs: Right of appeal: Albania)  [2016]
    UKUT 411 that there was  no  statutory  right  of  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State and dismissed the appeal for want of
    jurisdiction.

 3. The appellant  made  an  out-of-time  application  to  challenge  Judge
    Hanes's decision and was given permission to do so by Judge Ford  in  a
    decision dated 20th December 2017.

 4. In the light of the decision in Khan v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 both parties agreed that the First-tier
    Tribunal had been wrong in  law  to  conclude  that  it  did  not  have
    jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

Notice of Decision

Accordingly the decision of Judge Hanes is set aside.  The  appeal  will  be
re-heard by a judge other than Judge Hanes at Taylor House on a date  to  be
notified.

No anonymity direction is made.
