For the Appellant:     Not Represented

Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Respondent with regard to a determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Fox) promulgated on 9th April 2014. For the sake of clarity  and
    continuity however, I shall continue to refer to the Secretary of State
    as the Respondent and Mr Abdul as the Appellant.

 2. The appeal was dealt with on the papers in the First-tier  Tribunal  at
    the Appellant's request. Similarly, there was neither attendance by the
    Appellant nor any representative on his behalf before me in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 3. In the First-tier, Judge Fox noted that the Appellant had  applied  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant   and  that  his
    application had been refused due to  a  lack  of  sufficient  funds  as
    required by the Rules. The Judge noted that the Appellant was  required
    to have �9,000 for 28 days but for part of the period in  question  the
    documents showed he had only �8,922.22. The Judge noted that the  funds
    fell short by only �77.78 and considered it unreasonable  to  deny  the
    Appellant the opportunity  to  study  for  that  amount  of  money  and
    therefore found at paragraph 15 that the Appellant met the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules.

 4. In allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules when  he  had  quite
    clearly found that he did not meet the Rules the Judge made an error of
    law. Furthermore, even if the Judge had allowed the appeal on Article 8
    grounds on the "near miss" principle that would also have been an error
    of law.  It has been made clear by the Court of Appeal  in  Miah,  Bibi
    and Salman v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 261 that there is no such thing  as a
    "near miss" applicable to the Immigration Rules - an  Appellant  either
    meets the Rules or he does not. In this case the Appellant did not.

 5. In allowing the appeal therefore the judge made an error of  law  which
    was determinative of the outcome  and  therefore  clearly  material.  I
    therefore set aside his determination and I redecide the appeal.

 6. The Appellant clearly could not meet the  maintenance  requirements  of
    paragraph 245ZX (d) and therefore fails under the Immigration Rules.

 7. So far as Article 8 is  concerned  there  is  no  evidence  that  would
    indicate there are any arguable grounds for allowing  the  appeal  when
    the Appellant does not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    in accordance with Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules -  correct  approach)
    [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) . This Appellant has been in the UK only  since
    2012. It is not a case where he is part-way through a course of  study.
    He has  completed  one  course  and  is  seeking  to  start  a  second.
    Accordingly, the refusal does not represent a  disproportionate  breach
    of his private or family life.

 8. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed such that  the  Appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State is dismissed.





Signed                              Date 26th June 2014
