                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. This appeal comes before me in order to re-make  the  decision  in  the
    appeal pursuant to a decision finding an error  of  law  following  the
    hearing at Field House on 2 December 2014.  The error of  law  decision
    is a matter of record and should  be  read  as  part  of  the  decision
    herein. (For ease of reference I have reproduced its text in  an  Annex
    set out at the end of this Decision.)

 2. The appeal is against a decision of the Respondent dated 7 August  2013
    to remove the Appellant following a refusal of an application for leave
    to remain based on family and  private  life  -  most  particularly  in
    respect of the Appellant's relationship to Mr Thomas Paul  Williams,  a
    British Citizen.

 3. The Appellant's immigration history is summarised at paragraph 3 of the
    'error of law' decision in these terms:

         "The Appellant  is  a  national  of  the  Philippines  born  on  14
         September 1969. She entered the UK  on  26  July  2010  with  entry
         clearance as a domestic worker and  was  granted  leave  to  remain
         until 8 January 2011. An out-of-time application for further  leave
         to remain was refused with  no  right  of  appeal  in  March  2011.
         Thereafter the Appellant sought to regularise her status in the  UK
         pursuant to her relationship with Mr Thomas Williams - initially on
         the basis of being his fianc�e and subsequent to their marriage  on
         17 December 2011 as a spouse. Representations made  in  April  2011
         were refused  with  no  right  of  appeal  in  June  2011.  Further
         representations were made in or about November  2012  (supplemented
         by further  representations  in  July  2013),  culminating  in  the
         removal decision that is the subject of this appeal."

 4. In pursuing her appeal the Appellant now relies on  section  R-LTRP  of
    Appendix FM, and in the alternative on a 'free-standing' application of
    Article 8 of  the  ECHR  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.  Ms  Physsas
    acknowledges that the Appellant does not now contend that she  has  'no
    ties' with the Philippines, and accordingly  paragraph  276ADE  is  not
    relied upon.

 5. In respect of paragraph  R-LTRP.1.1  it  is  uncontroversial  that  the
    Appellant and her partner are in the UK, and  that  the  Appellant  had
    made a  valid  application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  partner  (R-
    LTRP1.1.(a) and (b)). Ms Physsas acknowledges in her Skeleton  Argument
    (paragraph 11) that the Appellant had overstayed by more than  28  days
    and therefore did not meet the requirements under E-LTRP.2.2(b), and in
    consequence  could  not  satisfy  R-LTRP.1.1.(c).  In  respect  of   R-
    LTRP.1.1.(d) the ultimate focus in this appeal is on subsection (iii) -
    i.e. whether paragraph EX.1 applied.  The  relevant  provision  of  the
    exception contained in  paragraph  EX.1(b)  is  "the  applicant  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner who is in the UK and
    is a British Citizen, settled in the UK or in the UK with refugee leave
    or humanitarian protection, and there are insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life with that partner continuing outside the UK".

 6. The Respondent does not dispute that the Appellant is in a genuine  and
    subsisting marital relationship with Mr  Williams,  who  is  a  British
    citizen, (see RFRL at paragraph 22), and accordingly the issue  in  the
    appeal under the Rules is that of "insurmountable obstacles  to  family
    life... continuing outside the UK".



Evidence / Facts

 7. Ms Physsas helpfully accepts that  the  summaries  of  the  Appellant's
    evidence and of Mr Williams' evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    set out at paragraphs  6-8  of  the  decision  of  Judge  Newberry  are
    accurate. So far as is relevant those paragraphs are in these terms:

         "6. [W]hilst working for her employer as a  domestic  worker,  [the
         Appellant] met Mr Thomas Williams in or around  August  2010.  They
         married on 17 December 2011. ... They are very happy together. They
         jointly attend the JIL Group which is a born  again  church  group.
         They attend church together. The Appellant has many friends in  the
         UK.

         7. She says she cannot return to the Philippines. Both her  parents
         have passed away and she has no property to return to. She says her
         husband would not  be  able  to  endure  the  long  flight  to  the
         Philippines. She says that she has been married to husband for over
         two and a half  years  and  that  they  have  created  a  life  for
         themselves during this period.

         8.  Mr  Williams...  is  a  British  subject.  He  lives  with  the
         Appellant.... He owns [their home] subject to a small mortgage.  He
         is a 'sorter' with the Post Office for whom he has  worked  for  34
         years. He earns over �25,000. He explained  that  he  has  mobility
         problems which started to  worsen  following  the  passing  of  his
         parents. He says that the Appellant is  a  great  help  to  him  in
         managing what is in effect a disability."

 8. However, Ms Physsas emphasises that the further witness  statements  of
    the Appellant  and  Mr  Williams,  both  dated  19  December  2014  and
    contained in the bundle  filed  for  the  rehearing  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal, add further detail - in particular  regarding  the  financial
    dependence of the Appellant on Mr Williams, and the  financial  support
    given by Mr Williams to the Appellant's children  in  the  Philippines;
    the statements also contain more detail concerning Mr Williams' medical
    circumstances.

 9. Both the Appellant and Mr Williams adopted their witness  statements  -
    that is the statements before the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  more
    recent statements dated 19 December  2014  -  in  examination-in-chief.
    There were no supplementary questions  for  either  in  examination-in-
    chief. They were each cross-examined by Mr  Duffy.  Each  witness  also
    answered a few questions by way of clarification from  me.  There  were
    also some questions by way of re-examination of  Mr  Williams.  I  have
    made a note of the evidence in the Record of Proceedings  which  is  on
    file and I have had regard to all that has been  said  at  the  hearing
    before reaching my decision.

10. I have also had regard to the  supporting  documentary  evidence,  both
    before the First-tier Tribunal and contained in the bundle  before  the
    Upper Tribunal

Consideration

11. The Appellant's case, both under  the  Rules  and  in  respect  of  any
    freestanding consideration of Article 8, is necessarily  based  on  the
    same factual matrix. It is essentially argued  that  a  combination  of
    circumstances make it "not practically  possible  and/or  unreasonable"
    (Skeleton Argument at paragraph 17) for Mr Williams to relocate to  the
    Philippines, and that it would be disproportionate for the Appellant to
    quit the UK to make an application for entry clearance "because of  the
    impact on Mr  Williams  of  the  Appellant  having  to  leave  the  UK"
    (paragraph 18). The circumstances relied upon are: Mr  Williams  has  a
    job and has been in  the  same  employment  for  34  years;  he  has  a
    mortgage; he has lived in the UK since birth; he has mobility  problems
    due to his size which do not permit him to travel long  distances;  the
    Appellant provides him with daily support; and the  Appellant  and  her
    children are financially dependent on him.

12. In my judgement such matters as Mr Williams' residence  and  employment
    in the UK do not in themselves impact on the practicality of relocation
    of the couple to the  Philippines.  I  consider  that  the  concept  of
    insurmountable obstacles necessarily relates to the  practicalities  of
    relocation: indeed inherent in paragraph EX.1 - save in respect of  the
    more particular circumstances of a recognised refugee or a person  with
    humanitarian protection - is the concept of a  relevant  partner  being
    established in the UK by way of being a British citizen  or  a  settled
    migrant. Nor, in the wider concept of an Article 8 consideration, do  I
    consider  that  the  circumstances  of  Mr  Williams'   residence   and
    employment are in any way exceptional.

13. As regards Mr Williams' mobility problems I do not accept that there is
    anything in the supporting evidence to make  good  the  assertion  that
    there would be insurmountable  practical  difficulties  in  respect  of
    travel to the  Philippines.  Whilst  I  accept  that  he  has  mobility
    problems by virtue of his weight and a  diagnosis  of  osteo-arthritis,
    and  also  that  he  lacks  flexibility  such  that  he  benefits  from
    assistance in dressing his lower body, most particularly in respect  of
    shoes and socks, there is nothing in the supporting  evidence  (see  in
    particular Appellant's bundle at pages 22-39) to the effect that he  is
    unfit to travel by aeroplane or otherwise. It is to be  borne  in  mind
    that he is in full-time employment and is far from being housebound; in
    so far as it may be likely that lengthy periods of immobility may cause
    discomfort and/or stiffening of his lower limbs I bear in mind that  it
    is possible to get up and  move  around  on  an  international  flight.
    Whilst I also note the history of concerns  relating  to  raised  blood
    pressure and a slightly enlarged heart, there  is  nothing  to  suggest
    that these matters render the Appellant unfit to fly.

14. Nor in my judgement has anything been shown  to  demonstrate  that  the
    Philippines is inherently a place which would present the  Appellant  -
    and more particularly Mr Williams - with  insurmountable  obstacles  in
    settling. I accept that  Mr  Williams  may  face  difficulties  in  the
    employment market  (albeit  no  express  evidence  of  the  nature  and
    conditions of the employment market were provided to me),  but  in  the
    context of resettling I am not persuaded that the  Appellant  would  be
    unable to find any employment and nothing has been provided  to  me  by
    way of finances or in respect of the potential capital to  be  realised
    by the sale of Mr Williams' home. In  the  absence  of  such  financial
    information I am not persuaded that the Appellant has demonstrated that
    the couple's relocation  to  the  Philippines  would  face  significant
    financial obstacles.

15. Moreover in this context it is to be noted that the Appellant has adult
    children in the Philippines. Whilst historically she has supported them
    through her employment I am not satisfied that it has been  shown  that
    they could not now return the favour by supporting their mother and her
    partner in the event that the Appellant was herself unable to find  any
    source of income through employment.

16. In all such circumstances I am not persuaded  that  the  Appellant  has
    satisfied  me  on  a  balance   of   probabilities   that   there   are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life  with  Mr  Williams  continuing
    outside the UK. In my judgement the  Appellant  does  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules: the Respondent's decision was in
    accordance with the Rules.

17. For the  avoidance  of  any  doubt,  and  notwithstanding  the  further
    submissions submitted in writing by the Respondent in  respect  of  the
    amendments  to  the  Immigration  Rules  by  way   of   definition   of
    'insurmountable obstacles' (new paragraph EX.2), further to my analysis
    in the 'error of law decision' I have applied the Rules as  they  stood
    prior to such an amendment.

18. I turn to a consideration of Article 8. I am not persuaded  that  there
    any exceptional features in this case that impact  upon  relocation  to
    the Philippines. Mr Williams residence and employment are not  unusual;
    his medical conditions are not unusual or  particularly  grave.  In  my
    judgement  the  Rules  adequately  and  proportionately   address   the
    circumstances of the Appellant and Mr Williams. Accordingly, and in any
    event, in this context in my judgement the reality is that the  Article
    8 issue is to be considered on the premise that the couple will seek to
    establish a home in the UK and the effect of the Respondent's  decision
    would be potentially to separate them for a period of time  whilst  the
    Appellant pursued an application for entry clearance from abroad;  i.e.
    a situation analogous to that in Chikwamba.

19. In this context what is particularly relied upon is the  daily  support
    given to Mr Williams by the Appellant. I  entirely  accept  given  that
    their's is a genuine marital relationship that there is  a  significant
    element of mutual  emotional  support  and  love,  and  also  that  the
    Appellant provides practical assistance to her husband.  I  accept  the
    consistent testimonies of the Appellant and her husband to  the  effect
    that she assists him with bathing and  dressing,  and  also  undertakes
    household chores including preparing meals.

20. I am not, however, satisfied that Mr Williams would be unable  to  cope
    pending any temporary separation from the Appellant. There  is  nothing
    in the medical evidence that supports the  notion  that  he  inevitably
    requires care and support in respect of daily living activities. In his
    oral evidence he told me that his regular treatment amounted to no more
    than over-the-counter analgesics (painkillers). He could  get  his  own
    trousers on but his main problem was in respect of his socks and shoes;
    if he wore shoes with a Velcro fastening he  could  do  this  using  an
    adapted stick, but the results might be loose; he also stated  that  he
    required  help  bathing  his  lower  body.  Told  me  that  before  his
    relationship with the appellant he  had  had  nobody  to  help  him  in
    consequence he would go to work with no socks and his hygiene was poor.
    I  was  not,  however,  satisfied  that  Mr  Williams  had  made   full
    exploration of the possibility of  obtaining  aids  that  would  better
    assist with putting on socks and doing up  his  shoes.  Adaptations  at
    work had amounted to no more than swapping his locker and offering  him
    advice on bending: in my judgement were the Appellant  to  be  under  a
    more  significant  disability  such  that  he  required   the   regular
    assistance of a third party it is reasonable to expect that more  would
    have been done by way of adaptation and/or exploring aids.

21. In all the circumstances I find that it is more likely than not that Mr
    Williams would be able to manage his activities  of  daily  living  and
    continue his employment in the absence of the Appellant.

22. The Respondent provided supporting evidence of the processing times for
    visas in Manila. Most (98%) applications are processed within 60 days -
    and indeed 65% of processed within 30 days.

23. Although no such concerns were expressly articulated, I  could  readily
    understand if the Appellant and Mr Williams were to have concerns  over
    possible delay and/or failure to secure entry  clearance  as  a  spouse
    were the Appellant to return  to  the  Philippines  for  that  purpose.
    However,  on  the  face  of  it  the  Appellant  appears  to  meet  the
    requirements for entry clearance. Further, there is no evidence of  any
    undue delay in processing applications  from  the  Philippines.  Indeed
    given the acceptance of the relationship by the Respondent - and indeed
    the findings in this regard made by the First-tier Tribunal -  much  of
    any entry clearance application should be processed readily and without
    controversy. Accordingly, any possible reluctance to submit  themselves
    to the inherent uncertainty of an  application  process  cannot  in  my
    judgement sound  with  any  material  significance  -  far  less  be  a
    determinative factor - in the absence of any adequate evidence that the
    system does not operate fairly. Such uncertainty  as  is  engendered  -
    which is inherent in any system involving  a  process  of  application,
    evaluation, and decision - cannot in itself provide a justification for
    by-passing the established system of immigration control.

24. Nor do I find that there  is  any  other  feature  of  this  case  that
    justifies the relaxation  of  the  established  system  of  immigration
    control through the fair and consistent application of a published  set
    of Rules.

25. In general terms, outside the concept  of  an  arranged  marriage,  any
    couple in love seeking to marry will inevitably have discussions  about
    their prospective married life, and such  discussions  will  inevitably
    involve consideration of matters beyond the romantic and  will  include
    some consideration of where will be the marital home. If one  or  other
    or both of the prospective  parties  to  the  marriage  is  subject  to
    immigration control then necessarily that will add a further  dimension
    to such discussions - particularly in the context of where  the  couple
    may live. If they think they may like to live together in the UK,  then
    necessarily with reference to the Immigration Rules  this  will  add  a
    particular further dimension. In this case the Appellant can have  been
    under no illusion that the Rules would not favour her application:  she
    had made an application based on Article  8  in  April  2011  that  was
    refused in June 2011. In my judgement the  Appellant  and  her  husband
    went into the marriage, and made the current application, knowing  full
    well the possible outcome. They must be taken to have married  in  that
    knowledge and to that extent to have factored in the  possible  adverse
    outcome, and therefore have resigned themselves to the  possibility  of
    dealing with it if it eventuated. (If not -  they  were  reckless,  and
    that should not now sound in their favour.)

26. Ultimately, this is essentially a couple who would  prefer  not  to  be
    apart for any time. That is not  an  exceptional  feature,  and  in  my
    judgement does not justify a relaxation of the  system  of  immigration
    control such as to avoid the requirement for entry clearance.

27. During the course of the hearing Mr Duffy identified, and  explored  in
    his questions to the Appellant and Mr Williams, that were the Appellant
    to succeed in obtaining entry clearance from abroad she would be  on  a
    faster route to settlement than if she were to succeed in  her  appeal.
    This circumstance was not something that either  the  Appellant  or  Mr
    Williams had been aware of prior to  the  hearing.  I  mention  it  for
    completeness: it does not, in my judgement, directly  impact  upon  the
    Article 8 balance that I must undertake. However the Appellant may take
    some succour from the fact that a temporary absence in order to  secure
    entry clearance as a spouse may in due course  lead  to  her  acquiring
    settled status in the UK far quicker (in 5 years rather than 10  years)
    than by way of pursuing the instant application and appeal.

28. Be that as it may, in all of the circumstances of this particular  case
    I do not consider that any exceptional or compelling  factor  has  been
    shown as to why the Appellant's circumstances and those of her  partner
    should be determined in a more generous way than the Rules would allow.
    Accordingly, whilst there is no particular controversy  in  respect  if
    the first four Razgar questions, I  find  that  the  fifth  question  -
    proportionality, is not  to  be  answered  in  the  Appellant's  favour
    bearing  in  mind  the  public  interest  in  maintaining  a  fair  and
    consistent  system  of  immigration  control  primarily   through   the
    consistent application  of  a  published  body  of  Rules  approved  by
    Parliament.

29. For the avoidance of any doubt I have had regard to the public interest
    considerations in section 117B  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002,  and  have  factored  such  matters  into  my  overall
    consideration  of  proportionality.  The   maintenance   of   effective
    immigration control is in the public interest; there are no concerns in
    respect of the Appellant's ability to speak English or  in  respect  of
    her partner's ability to ensure the couple's financial independence.  I
    do note however  that  the  relationship  with  Mr  Williams  has  been
    established at a time when the Appellant had no extant leave.

30. There is  present  here  nothing  of  comparable  circumstance  to  the
    presence of a child of the couple or a difficult country situation that
    were identified in Chikwamba as favourable factors in an evaluation.  I
    do not consider Mr Williams' mobility /  care  needs  to  be  similarly
    compelling. The Respondent's decision is  proportionate  and  does  not
    breach the Appellant's or Mr Williams' or anybody else's human rights.

Notice of Decision

31. The appeal is dismissed.


Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal I. A. Lewis     4 September 2015


                                   ANNEX:

                       TEXT OF 'ERROR OF LAW' DECISION

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Newberry promulgated on 4 September  2014  allowing  Ms  Sain's  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary of State dated 7 August  2013  to
    remove her from the UK.

 2. Although before me the Secretary of State is the appellant and Ms  Sain
    the respondent, for the sake of consistency with the proceedings before
    the First-tier Tribunal I shall hereafter  refer  to  Ms  Sain  as  the
    Appellant and the Secretary of State as the Respondent.

Background

 3. The Appellant is a national of the Philippines  born  on  14  September
    1969. She entered the UK on 26 July 2010  with  entry  clearance  as  a
    domestic worker and was granted leave to remain until 8  January  2011.
    An out-of-time application for further leave to remain was refused with
    no right of appeal in March 2011. Thereafter the  Appellant  sought  to
    regularise her status in the UK pursuant to her  relationship  with  Mr
    Thomas Williams - initially on the  basis  of  being  his  fianc�e  and
    subsequent  to  their  marriage  on  17  December  2011  as  a  spouse.
    Representations made in April 2011 were refused with no right of appeal
    in June 2011. Further representations were made in  or  about  November
    2012  (supplemented  by  further   representations   in   July   2013),
    culminating in the removal decision that is the subject of this appeal.

 4. There was before me  some  initial  confusion  as  to  the  application
    history. The papers currently available  to  me  omit  details  of  the
    representations made in or about November 2012; indeed the RFRL dated 7
    August 2013 commences by thanking the  Appellant  for  the  application
    made on 12 April 2011 (which had already been rejected). Be that as  it
    may, following a preliminary discussion with the representatives it was
    common ground before me that the relevant  application  post-dated  the
    amendments to the Immigration Rules that came  into  force  on  9  July
    2012, and as such paragraphs 276ADE and Appendix FM were applicable.

 5. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons set out in his determination.

 6. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which was granted by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Simpson on 28 October 2014.

Application to Amend Grounds

 7. Mr Jarvis sought leave to amend the Respondent's grounds  of  challenge
    to reflect amendments to the Immigration Rules introduced  with  effect
    from 28 July 2014, in particular in respect of paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)
    and the addition of paragraph EX.2 in Appendix FM by way of  explaining
    the meaning of 'insurmountable obstacles'. In this context it was noted
    that although the appeal had been heard on 30 June 2014, and signed  27
    July 2014, its promulgation date was 4 September 2014. The  application
    was raised in general terms, and no specific  written  amended  grounds
    were formulated or otherwise advanced.

 8. Ms Physass objected to the application. She noted  that  no  particular
    reason was advanced as to why the amendment was only  being  raised  at
    this stage in the proceedings, and indicated that she was not  prepared
    to deal with the substance of any as yet unformulated amendment,  which
    would potentially occasion an  adjournment  and  therefore  unnecessary
    delay. More particularly, however, she directed  my  attention  to  the
    wording of HC532, by which  the  various  amendments  were  introduced,
    emphasising the following under the heading 'Implementation' in respect
    of the particular changes to 276ADE and Appendix  FM:  "The  changes...
    take effect on 28 July 2014 and apply  to  all  applications  to  which
    paragraph 276ADE to 276H and Appendix FM apply (or can  be  applied  by
    virtue of the Immigration Rules), and  to  any  other  ECHR  Article  8
    claims (save for those from foreign criminals), and which  are  decided
    on or after that date". Ms Physass submitted that such wording,  whilst
    indicating that the changes would apply to applications  still  pending
    at the date of change, did not indicate that any  applications  already
    decided could be re-evaluated under the new Rules  when  on  appeal.  I
    agree with that submission.

 9. Accordingly, in circumstances where the changes to the Rules  were  not
    relevant to the First-tier Tribunal's consideration of the  case  under
    the Rules, the proposed amendment served no  purpose.  I  rejected  the
    Respondent's application.

10. As regards Article 8 and the amendments by way of the addition of  Part
    5A to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum 2002, I observe  that  it
    is  not  apparent  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  undertook  a
    'freestanding'  Article  8  assessment  in   the   alternative   to   a
    consideration of the case under the  Rules.  There  is,  therefore,  no
    necessity to amend the grounds in this respect.

Consideration: Error of Law

11. In my judgement the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  is
    materially flawed in a number of significant respects.

12. In the first instance, there is a lack of clarity  as  to  whether  the
    Judge favourably determined the appeal by reference to paragraph 276ADE
    or Appendix FM, or both. Whilst  reference  is  made  to  both,  it  is
    impossible to discern any discreet clear analysis or discreet  findings
    in respect of either.

13. In so far as the Judge  gave  consideration  to  the  Appellant's  case
    pursuant to paragraph 276ADE, he erred in failing to determine the case
    either  with  express  reference  to,  or  otherwise  in  substance  in
    accordance with, the guidance in  Ogundimu  (Article  8  -  new  rules)
    Nigeria [2013] UKUT 00060 (IAC) in respect of the meaning of 'ties'  in
    paragraph 276ADE(vi).

14. In Ogundimu the UT considered paragraph 399A of  the  Rules  where  the
    same wording - "no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the
    country to which he would have to go" - appears. The use  of  the  same
    wording in paragraph 276ADE of the Rules  is  expressly  recognised  in
    Ogundimu: see paragraph 122. The following passages from paragraphs 123
    and 125 are key:

   "The natural and ordinary meaning of the word 'ties' imports, we  think,
         a concept involving something more than merely remote and  abstract
         links to  the  country  of  proposed  deportation  or  removal.  It
         involves there  being  a  continued  connection  to  life  in  that
         country; something that ties a claimant to his or  her  country  of
         origin. If this were not the case  then  it  would  appear  that  a
         person's nationality of the country of proposed  deportation  could
         of itself lead to a failure to meet the requirements of  the  rule.
         This would render the application of the rule,  given  the  context
         within which it operates, entirely meaningless." And -

   "Whilst each case turns on its own facts, circumstances relevant to  the
         assessment of whether a person has ties to  the  country  to  which
         they would have to go if they were required  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom must include, but are not limited to: the length of time  a
         person has spent in the country to which he would have to go if  he
         were required to leave the United Kingdom, the age that the  person
         left that country, the exposure that person has had to the cultural
         norms of that country, whether that person speaks the  language  of
         the country, the extent of the family and friends that  person  has
         in the country to which he is being deported  or  removed  and  the
         quality of the relationships that person has with those friends and
         family members."

15. The Judge's analysis is wholly deficient. At paragraph 12, he lists the
    Respondent's reasons for concluding that the  Appellant  retained  ties
    with the Philippines. At paragraph 13 the Judge does not address any of
    these matters, but instead refers to the strength  of  the  Appellant's
    relationship with her British citizen partner. The  Judge  then  states
    his conclusion - "I do not consider that the Appellant  has  'ties'  to
    the Philippines which outweigh the marriage to a British subject".

16. This appears, inappropriately, to introduce a comparative  test.  There
    is no such comparative test justified by  the  wording  of  the  Rules.
    Moreover, there is otherwise a failure to evaluate, or make  any  clear
    findings in respect of, the issue of 'ties'. It is to be recalled  that
    this is in the context of an Appellant who has five children living  in
    the Philippines, two of whom are minors  living  with  the  Appellant's
    sister.

17. In so far as the Judge may have been considering Appendix FM  there  is
    an absence of any express reference to the relevant Rules in respect of
    leave to remain as a partner, and  in  particular  an  absence  of  any
    express reference to paragraph EX.1. This in itself need not  be  fatal
    if the Judge had otherwise conducted an analysis and made  findings  in
    substance congruent with EX.1(b). He has not done so.

18. The Judge plainly  placed  considerable  weight  on  the  fact  of  the
    Appellant's  relationship  with  her  British  citizen  partner:   "The
    Appellant's marriage to Mr Williams is a material and weighty factor in
    this case" (paragraph 13). The fact of the marriage is not  a  'weighty
    factor' when considering the question of insurmountable obstacles under
    EX.1: rather it is the precondition for embarking on a consideration of
    the question of insurmountable obstacles; it is the premise  underlying
    EX.1(b) - "This paragraph applies if the applicant has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with a partner who  is  in  the  UK  and  is  a
    British citizen... and there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
    life with that partner continuing outside the UK" (my emphasis)  -  and
    therefore cannot in itself be a weighty  consideration  in  determining
    the applicability of the further requirements of that paragraph of  the
    Rules.

19. Further the Judge  applies  a  test  of  reasonableness  -  "I  am  not
    persuaded that it is  reasonable..."  (paragraph  13)  -  which  in  my
    judgement, does  not  properly  reflect  the  test  of  'insurmountable
    obstacles', which whilst mitigated by the observations of the Court  of
    Appeal in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, necessarily  must  involve
    something more than the mere concept of reasonableness.

20. The Judge did not apparently conduct a freestanding Article 8  analysis
    beyond the express requirements of the Rules.

21. In all such circumstances I find that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    materially erred, and that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal must
    be set aside.

22. Both parties agreed that  it  was  possible  and  appropriate  for  the
    decision in the appeal to be remade before the  Upper  Tribunal.  After
    brief discussion with the representatives I  decided  that  the  appeal
    should be adjourned, reserved to me, permitting the Appellant  3  weeks
    to file and serve any further evidence upon which she wished to rely. I
    gave an oral Direction to this effect at the hearing.

23. I also indicated to the parties, and to the  Respondent  in  particular
    that, notwithstanding my observations at paragraph 8 above, I would  be
    prepared to hear further argument if any relevant case law or  guidance
    could be produced as to the way in which the Tribunal  should  consider
    the amendments to the Rules in cases where the decision  that  was  the
    subject of the appeal had been made prior  to  such  amendments  coming
    into force.

Notice of Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  contained  a  material
    error of law and is set aside.

25. The decision in the appeal is to be remade before the  Upper  Tribunal,
    reserved to me, on 27 January 2015.
-----------------------
[1] Although the Secretary of  State  is  the  appellant  and  Ms  Sain  the
respondent in the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal,  for  the  sake  of
consistency  with  the  proceedings  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and
bearing in mind that following the 'error of law' hearing  the  decision  in
the appeal is being re-made, I shall hereafter  refer  to  Ms  Sain  as  the
Appellant and the Secretary of State as the Respondent.
