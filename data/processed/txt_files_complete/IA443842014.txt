Representation:
Appellant   Mr Richardson, Counsel, instructed by Nasim and Co
Respondent  Mr Tarlow (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan.  The  appellant  entered  the
    United Kingdom on October 7, 2017 having been given leave to enter  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 4 student until January 17, 2011. His visa was
    extended in the same category until August 28, 2913 when he was granted
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post study work) Migrant.

 2. On August 20, 2014 he submitted an application to  vary  his  leave  to
    enable him to remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.  This  was
    refused by the respondent on October 16, 2014  because  the  respondent
    was not satisfied the appellant had  provided  the  required  documents
    under Appendix A Paragraph 41-SD of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The appellant appealed this decision on November 4, 2014, under Section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 4. The appeal came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Plumptre  on
    July 6, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on July 22, 2015 she refused
    the application having regard to the Immigration Rules.

 5. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on  August  5,  2015  submitting
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Plumptre had erred but  permission  to
    appeal was refused  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Astle  on
    November 16, 2015 on the grounds there  was  no  error  in  law.  Those
    grounds were renewed to the Upper Tribunal on December 1,  2015.  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Taylor found on December 9, 2015 it was  arguable  there
    had been an error in law because it was arguable the decision  was  not
    in accordance with the Rules because the respondent may have considered
    the application with reference to the wrong Rule. In a rule 24 response
    dated December 22, 2015 the respondent argued that it mattered  not  if
    the right Rule had been considered  because  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Plumptre had found the offer of funds was not genuine.

 6. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I extend that Order.

 7. The matter came before me on the above date.

    SUBMISSIONS

 8. Mr Richardson referred  back  to  the  application  form  and  original
    decision and submitted that the First-tier Judge had erred because  she
    failed to engage  with  the  crucial  point  that  the  respondent  had
    firstly, considered the application  under  the  wrong  provisions  and
    secondly, had considered an issue that the respondent had not raised or
    considered in the refusal letter. He submitted the application made  on
    August 20, 2014 and it had been made on the  basis  the  appellant  has
    access to �200,000 (See Section G 3A of the application form)  and  the
    appellant ticked the appropriate  box  indicating  this.  However,  the
    respondent considered his application on different  basis  namely  post
    study worker and access to �50,000. The main differences were that such
    an application brings with it additional documentary requirements  (see
    table 4D of Appendix A) over and above those set out  in  Table  4A  of
    Appendix A. These requirements are contained in paragraph  41-SD(e)  of
    Appendix A. At the original hearing this was pointed out  to  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Plumptre but she did not deal with  it  because
    on the face of it she did not understand the point counsel was  making.
    Her options, if she had accepted this point would have been  to  either
    send it back to the respondent for decision in accordance with the  law
    or consider it under the correct Rule herself. The first error  of  law
    therefore related to the failure by the Judge to  consider  this  under
    the correct Rule.

 9. Mr Richardson went onto submit  that  her  second  error  was  to  then
    consider  a  refusal  under  paragraph  245DD  despite  the  fact   the
    respondent had deferred any consideration of this due to her  incorrect
    application of the Rules.  At  the  hearing  the  representatives  were
    content to deal with the case on submissions  but  the  Judge  decided,
    during submissions, that she wanted to  hear  some  oral  evidence.  Mr
    Richardson submitted this was the Judge's second error as  it  was  not
    her role to make a primary decision  on  genuineness  in  circumstances
    when the respondent had not raised it. The third  error  was  that  the
    Judge's approach breached the  Rules  of  common  law  fairness.  Judge
    rejected counsel's claim that this was a new matter at  paragraph  [23]
    but it had never been raised in the refusal letter. He submitted  there
    was a material error in law.

10. Mr Tarlow relied on the Rule 24 letter dated December 22, 2015. After a
    brief discussion concerning  the  original  decision  he  accepted  the
    original decision had been taken under the wrong Rule. He accepted many
    of the points made by Mr Richardson but submitted that as the Judge was
    not satisfied about the genuineness of the  funds  it  mattered  little
    which Rule was applied.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

11. Mr Tarlow agreed with me that the application had been considered under
    the wrong Rule. He further  agreed  that  in  her  refusal  letter  the
    Secretary of State had not considered any issues under paragraph  245DD
    HC 395.  I  pointed  out  to  him  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had
    specifically reserved the right  to  request  independent  third  party
    verification under paragraph 245DD HC 395.

12. I posed the question to him that if the respondent had  considered  the
    application under the wrong Rules and had  not  considered  independent
    third party verification then how could he argue that the decision  was
    in accordance with the Rules when the Judge's reason for  refusing  the
    application was based on both those points.

13. Mr Tarlow indicated that if I felt the decision was not  in  accordance
    with the law then he would tend to agree with me and  that  the  matter
    should ne referred back to the respondent for a fresh decision.

14. I was satisfied that was the appropriate course of  action.  The  judge
    had struggled to come to terms with which Rule should  be  applied  and
    has of her  own  volition  called  for  evidence  to  be  given  during
    submissions. Mr Tarlow accepted the wrong Rule had been applied and  it
    seems that if the Judge wanted to consider paragraph 245DD HC 395  then
    she should have clarified whether that was  the  respondent's  position
    and then considered whether the respondent, as primary  decision  make,
    should have been given the opportunity to deal with the issue.

15. By failing to deal with these two issues I am satisfied  there  was  an
    error in law. The Judge may well  be  correct  that  genuineness  is  a
    matter to be  considered  but  the  third  party  should  be  given  an
    opportunity to address the concerns now raised by the  Judge  and  this
    can best me achieved by asking the Secretary of State to make  a  fresh
    decision having regard to the correct Rules.

16. Both representatives invited me  to  remit  this  matter  back  to  the
    Secretary of State on the  basis  the  original  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.

17. In the circumstances I find the decision is not in accordance with  the
    law because it suffered from a defect in procedure. The effect of  this
    determination is the October 16, 2014 decision is quashed and that  the
    application remains outstanding awaiting a lawful decision.

    DECISION

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I have set  aside  the  decision.
    The matter is remitted back to the Secretary of State for  the  reasons
    set out above.
