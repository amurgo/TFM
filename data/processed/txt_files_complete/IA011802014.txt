                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1.  This is an appeal against a  decision  and  reasons  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge McIntosh promulgated on 31st July 2015 in  which  she
       allowed an appeal against a decision made by the Secretary of  State
       on 12th December 2013 to refuse  the  respondent's  application  for
       leave to remain in the UK under the Immigration Rules and upon human
       rights' grounds.


    2. Permission to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Frankish on 23rd November 2015.


    3. On 28th January 2016, the appellant notified the Tribunal  by  email
       that pursuant to Rule 17(1) of the Upper Tribunal  Rules  2008,  the
       appellant gives notice of her withdrawal of her  Notice  of  Appeal.
       The appellant has now  made  a  decision  to  grant  the  respondent
       limited leave to remain in the UK as a parent.


    4. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Kotas confirmed  that  the  appellant
       wishes to withdraw the appeal, and for obvious reasons, there was no
       objection on the part of the respondent.


    5. In the circumstances, I give my consent to  the  withdrawal  of  the
       appeal by the appellant and the withdrawal of the appeal  shall  now
       take effect.


 Notice of Decision


    6. The Tribunal consents  to  the  withdrawal  of  the  appeal  by  the
       appellant.
