                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr M Blundell for the Secretary of State
Mr J Collins (counsel instructed by Rasiah & Co) for the claimant

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator  (Mr  JK  Stanford),
   sitting at Surbiton on 25 February, allowing an asylum and human  rights
   appeal by a Tamil citizen of Sri Lanka. Leave was given to challenge the
   adjudicator's finding of exceptional circumstances (see below).

2. Jeyachandran [2002] UKIAT 01869 (written by Collins P)  sets  the  scene
   for appeals of this type under current conditions, as  both  sides  were
   aware. While the circumstances of each individual case (of a  Sri  Lanka
   Tamil) still need to be considered, "...  it  is  only  the  exceptional
   cases that will not be able to return in  safety."  (�  8)  Since  those
   words were written, the situation has changed markedly for  the  better:
   in the course of the third week of September 2002, the ban on the  Tamil
   Tigers was  lifted,  and  peace  talks  started  between  them  and  the
   government.  By  5  December,  those  talks  had  resulted  in  a  joint
   declaration, described by the BBC as a 'breakthrough', by the government
   side as 'irreversible', and by the Tamil Tigers as 'historic'.
3. While there is  still  no  concluded  peace  agreement,  for  which  the
   government would need a two-thirds majority in Parliament, and which the
   President still opposes; while  negotiations  between  the  parties  are
   currently suspended; and while a number of  atrocities  leave  room  for
   doubt as to the Tamil Tigers' commitment to democracy in the areas  they
   control, it must be perfectly clear to any reasonable  person  that  the
   tide of history has turned, leaving many claims of this  kind  high  and
   dry on the shores of the past. There is certainly nothing to  be  gained
   from reference to any case heard before Jeyachandran came out on 10 June
   2002. We have to decide this case on an individual basis; but it remains
   clear  that,  for  such  an  appeal  to  succeed,  it  must  indeed   be
   exceptional. The peace process is, regrettably, stalled at present;  but
   there is nothing to show it is no longer  in  being.   There  have  been
   recent disquieting events on the political front in Colombo; but nothing
   to show that the situation on the ground  has  changed  so  far,  or  is
   likely to do so in the immediately foreseeable future.


4. The effect of Jeyachandran was considered by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
   Selvaratnam  [2003]  EWCA  Civ  121.  They  endorsed  the  approach   in
   Jeyachandran, though they took the view that it had been  misapplied  in
   the case before them. The clearest explanation is per Peter Gibson LJ at
   � 16:

      ... it is only in exceptional cases that  a  person  returned  to  Sri
   Lanka will attract the attention of the authorities there and that  such
   persons are likely to be limited to those who are  wanted  persons.  The
   question is whether the case of the applicant is an exceptional case  as
   a person likely to be of interest to the Sri Lankan authorities  and  so
   likely to be detained, it being conceded  that,  once  he  is  detained,
   there is a substantial risk of persecution.

      That is the question before us in the present case


   The Court of Appeal revisited the question of the approach to  be  taken
   by the Tribunal in cases of this kind  in  Indrakumar  [2003]  EWCA  Civ
   1677.  In the judgment of Hale LJ, at  paragraph  13,  she  sets  out  a
   number of different types of appeal. Both sides rightly agreed  the  one
   with which we are concerned is that at sub-paragraph (iv):





   There are findings as  to  the  application  of  those  general  country
   conditions to the facts in  the  particular  case.   There  will  be  an
   inference to be drawn by the adjudicator and then,  if  appropriate,  by
   the Tribunal. The Tribunal will be entitled to draw its own  inferences,
   just as is the appellate court under the CPR, once it  has  detected  an
   error in the adjudicator's approach."


6. Hale LJ goes on at paragraph 14:

   How should those principles be applied to this case?  The question, as  I
   have already indicated is  whether  the  Tribunal  was  simply  taking  a
   different view from the adjudicator. If that were the case that would  be
   an error of law on the part of the Tribunal, with which this Court  could
   interfere.  On the other hand, was the Tribunal, having found an error in
   the adjudicator's approach, simply substituting its  own  inferences  for
   those drawn by the adjudicator?  This is something that the  Tribunal  is
   entitled to do and this Court cannot interfere.


7. The history in this case is clearly set out by the  adjudicator  and  the
   significant part consists in four  periods  of  detention.   First,  from
   February to June 1998 when the claimant was detained by the Tamil  Tigers
   on suspicion of being a spy for the Sri Lankan Army.  He said  that  they
   had ill-treated him although the adjudicator did not  accept  that.   The
   second was between July 1998 and August 1999 when most unfortunately this
   time he was detained by the Sri Lankan Army as a suspected  spy  for  the
   Tamil Tigers. The third was from September 1999 to December 1999 when  he
   was  detained  by  PLOTE,  a  paramilitary  Tamil  organisation  on   the
   Government's side, in Vavunya.  He was further ill-treated which resulted
   in his being taken to hospital from where he escaped.


8. The adjudicator accepted both those periods of  detention,  as  also  the
   fourth, which  took  place  in  Colombo  in  January  to  February  2000,
   resulting in his release on bribe, and departure for  this  country.   It
   has not been suggested at any stage in this appeal that  the  adjudicator
   was not entitled to make those  primary  findings  of  credibility.   The
   question before us is as to the consequences which  should  have  ensued.
   The adjudicator's view of that appears at paragraph 35:

   I find that although this appellant may not  be  on  a  wanted  list  in
   relation to particular crimes there is a  serious  possibility  that  he
   will be on the security service files.  He has  been  in  their  custody
   twice and detained also by the LTTE and PLOTE and was not released in  a
   way which demonstrated a clear  conclusion  that  they  were  no  longer
   interested in him.  I find that if he were to be detained then again his
   scarring may fuel any suspicions held that he is a member  or  supporter
   of the LTTE.  That could again lead, despite the progress made towards a
   ceasefire and peace agreement, to detention and torture  or  other  ill-
   treatment while  in  detention.   I  find  that  this  appellant  is  in
   exceptional circumstances."


   That view is led up to by  what  the  adjudicator  had  to  say  in  his
   credibility findings at paragraph 24:

   I find that he has  been  caught  up  in  a  spiral  of  suspicion,  his
   detention by one group probably triggering suspicions by others.


9. Both sides agree that there was and is no specific evidence in this  case
   about any interest there might have been in this claimant by what in this
   country we should call the security services, as opposed to the  security
   forces.  The security forces (army and police) clearly  were  responsible
   for his second and fourth detentions, and to some extent for  the  third,
   although most  of  that  was  in  the  hands  of  PLOTE,  who  are  their
   collaborators.  We take the view that the adjudicator must have  intended
   to refer to the security forces and not "security service"  at  paragraph
   35.   Mr  Blundell's  case  is  that  takes  this  claimant  out  of  the
   exceptional  circumstances  required  by  Jeyachandran.  There   is   the
   additional point that the latest of these events took place a whole  year
   before the ceasefire in Sri Lanka, which the adjudicator  does  not  seem
   fully  to  have  taken  into  account  in  his  credibility  findings  or
   conclusions; and there is nothing to show  that  the  claimant  is  still
   wanted, as required in terms of Selvaratnam.

10. Mr Collins, rightly in our view, puts forward the third  detention  from
   September to December 1999 in Vavunya as being the significant one.  That
   is not because of any reason for it as to  which  there  is  and  was  no
   evidence but because it was ended by the claimant's escape  from  custody
   which, if  not  exactly  lawful,  was  at  least  in  the  hands  of  the
   authorities' allies.  Mr Collins,  however  concedes  that  there  is  no
   visible link between that detention and the last of January  to  February
   2000 in Colombo and that the latest  records  likely  to  exist  on  this
   claimant are likely to justify his release from that last detention.   Mr
   Collins  does  not  rely  on  the  claimant's  scarring  except,  as  the
   adjudicator did, to say that if the other facts in the case resulted in a
   significant enough interest in this claimant for him to be  detained  and
   strip searched then it would come to light.

11. Mr Collins has taken us through the background  evidence  as  to  recent
   events.  The passages to which he referred  us  come  first  from  a  BBC
   release of 22 April 2003 and the headline says most of what needs  to  be
   said, "Sri Lanka  steps  up  security:  Sri  Lankan  President  Chandrika
   Kumaratunga has placed security forces on a state of  high  alert".  This
   had followed the suspension of peace  negotiations  by  the  Tamil  Tiger
   side, to which we have already referred.The next item on which Mr Collins
   relied was a Guardian item of 21 August 2003 headlined, "Plot to kill Sri
   Lankan President". This is said to have resulted in increased security in
   the capital, Colombo, where the plot was due  to  be  carried  out.    Mr
   Collins suggests that the increased security may also extend  to  Colombo
   Airport to where, if at all, this claimant would be returned.   There  is
   no specific background evidence about that: as most people  dealing  with
   these cases know, the evidence had always suggested that  those  returned
   there were questioned, whether or not they  were  Tamils,  and  it  seems
   nothing has changed in that respect.


12. Mr Blundell concedes that  recent  events  and  the  current  stand  off
   between the President and the Prime Minister are disquieting, as we  have
   already indicated; but his main submission is that there  is  nothing  in
   them to show any revival of interest in persons such as this claimant.

13. In our view the adjudicator's decision is extremely well  set  out,  and
   in that respect almost a model of its kind.  He deals with  the  evidence
   at paragraphs 10-15, sets out his findings at paragraphs 24-31 and  draws
   his conclusions at  paragraphs  34-36,  all  in  chronological  order,  a
   principal not always respected by adjudicators or  others.   However,  we
   are left with his reference, which clearly he regarded as significant, to
   the "security service".  The adjudicator seems to have regarded  that  as
   taking this claimant outside the normal run of cases of this kind.  If it
   were to be looked at on that basis, then clearly it was a figment of  his
   imagination. The history of army and police detention  accepted  in  this
   case, though regrettable, is nothing extraordinary for cases of this kind
   before the ceasefire; and, as we already noted, the adjudicator does  not
   remind himself anywhere in his findings or conclusions that these  events
   had all ended a whole year before that happened. There does not  seem  to
   have been anything before him, and there is certainly nothing before  us,
   to show why any interest there might have been in this  claimant  in  the
   state of affairs at that time should have revived by the present.

14. If we had to consider whether this adjudicator was plainly wrong in  his
   decision then we should unhesitatingly  say  that  he  was;  but  on  the
   authority of Indrakumar that is not the question before us. We start from
   those errors of the adjudicator, which in our view led  him  to  a  wrong
   approach to the way that this claimant would be affected by  the  general
   situation in Sri Lanka, and so to take a wrong  view  as  to  whether  he
   would be at any real risk on return. In our  view  of  all  the  evidence
   before us, the right conclusion is that the claimant's history,  for  the
   reason we have already given, would not put him at any real risk  on  his
   return, and it follows that this appeal is allowed.
