                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  G  C
    Solly promulgated on 18 April 2019.   The  judge  dismissed  an  appeal
    brought by the appellant, a citizen of Nepal born in  1991,  against  a
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer dated 6 August 2018  to  refuse
    him entry clearance to settle in the United Kingdom  as  the  dependent
    son of his mother, the widow of a former Ghurkha soldier.

Factual Background

 2. The appellant was born in Nepal.   His  father  served  in  the  Gurkha
    regiment until 1960, but sadly died when the  appellant  was  only  two
    years old, in 1993.  The appellant lived with his mother, also  citizen
    of Nepal, in Nepal until she moved to  this  country  pursuant  to  the
    Ghurkha settlement scheme in September 2014.  The appellant remained in
    Nepal.  On 14 May 2018, the appellant applied for  entry  clearance  as
    the adult dependent relative of his mother, who is the sponsor in these
    proceedings.  The respondent refused the application on the basis  that
    there was no evidence  that  the  appellant  was  unable  to  care  for
    himself.  No details of his financial commitments  in  Nepal  had  been
    provided, and the support he did receive could continue.   Annex  K  to
    Chapter 15 of the Immigration Directorate  Instructions  did  not  make
    provision for the adult children of an ex-Gurkha widow.  There were  no
    exceptional circumstances meriting a grant of exceptional leave.

 3. It is the refusal of that decision that was  under  appeal  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 4. Before the judge, the appellant's written evidence was that he had been
    funded by, and was dependent upon,  his  mother,  from  Nepal.   He  is
    unemployed, unmarried and fully dependent upon her.  He pointed to  the
    cultural practice in Nepal of adult sons remaining  as  part  of  their
    parents' household until they marry.  His case was that  "family  life"
    existed between him and his mother, for the purposes of  Article  8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights ("the ECHR").

 5. At the hearing, the sponsor's written and oral evidence was that she is
    employed as a kitchen assistant with a  taxable  income  of  just  over
    �18,600.  That, on the evidence before the judge, gave a net income  in
    the region of around �1,319 monthly,  although  the  judge  noted  that
    there was some evidence demonstrating that in February 2018 she had net
    pay of �1,429.  The judge  considered  the  evidence  relating  to  the
    circumstances of the sponsor's living arrangements.  She had provided a
    tenancy agreement relating to a two bedroom property, claiming  one  of
    the rooms was vacant, and could be occupied by her son.   Her  evidence
    was that she remitted �200  to  �300  a  month  to  the  appellant,  in
    individual consignments of around �100 or �110, �190 or �200.

 6. The judge had credibility concerns with  the  evidence.   She  was  not
    satisfied that the property the  sponsor  said  she  rented  alone  was
    solely occupied by her.  The tenancy agreement suggested that there was
    another resident.  Although the sponsor said that that person  was  her
    landlord, the judge rejected  that  suggestion,  as  the  landlord  was
    specified as a third party elsewhere on the tenancy agreement,  with  a
    different name.  The judge  was  also  concerned  about  the  sponsor's
    ability to support the appellant to the sum claimed; given, as was  her
    evidence, she paid �1,200 each month in rent, and based on  her  income
    in the region of �1,300 monthly, the judge was concerned that it  would
    not be financially possible  for  the  sponsor  to  have  remitted  the
    claimed levels  of  support:  see  [30].   The  judge's  concerns  were
    compounded as the sponsor was also responsible for the utility bills in
    the property.  The judge rejected the sponsor's evidence  that  utility
    bills and other ancillary expenses were included in the rent of  �1,200
    a month, as the tenancy agreement said they were extra.

 7.  The  judge  reached  global  conclusions  on  the  claimed   financial
    dependency at [33].  She said  that  the  sponsor's  evidence  was  not
    credible.   The  judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had  some   health
    conditions and did accept that they existed to an extent, but  did  not
    find that there was any significant feature to those health  conditions
    which provided compelling or other reasons  for  the  appellant  to  be
    dependent on his mother.  At  [47]  the  judge  accepted  the  cultural
    practice in Nepal of adult sons remaining with their parents  or  their
    parents' household, but said:

         "I am not on the evidence  satisfied  that  the  appellant  is  not
         reasonably financially independent given my findings in relation to
         his ability to care for himself, work and the provision of  finance
         in Nepal.  I am not satisfied that there are any  special  features
         in this case in support of emotional support  save  these  cultural
         issues and  the  health  I  have  accepted  to  the  extent  of  my
         findings".

 8. The references to the financial provision in Nepal were to the military
    pension that the appellant's father  had  accrued  during  his  service
    which, the judge found at [31], was paid to the appellant.

 9. Against the background of those findings of fact, the judge  then  said
    at [48]:

         "I have considered whether Article 8 is engaged given  my  findings
         of fact."

10. The judge did not say in terms what her findings were  in  relation  to
    Article 8, in particular whether it was engaged or not.   At  [50]  the
    judge said that there was "currently  family  life  ...  split  between
    Nepal and the UK".  Then at [51] she outlined the  leading  authorities
    in relation to the  existence  of  family  life  between  adult  family
    members, in particular Kugathas v the Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31 and said,

         "given my findings of fact I consider that Article 8 is not engaged
         as the appellant is currently able to enjoy family  life  with  his
         mother when she returns to Nepal."

Grounds of Appeal

11. The grounds of appeal contend that the judge made  inadequate  findings
    relating to the so called historic wrongs suffered  by  former  Ghurkha
    soldiers, and that the judge failed to demonstrate what is described as
    "a common sense approach" in  relation  to  this  issue.   The  grounds
    further contend  that  the  judge  failed  in  her  assessment  of  the
    appellant's finances by reference to a pension the  appellant  received
    from his father's military service, and also contended that the judge's
    analysis of the sponsor's financial circumstances in this country  were
    flawed.

12. Permission to appeal was granted on all  grounds  by  Designated  Judge
    McClure of the First-tier Tribunal.



Discussion

13. During the course of submissions, Mr Khalid developed  the  grounds  of
    appeal, which were not settled by  him,  submitting  that  the  judge's
    findings concerning Article 8 were flawed, as well as  relying  on  the
    grounds' contention that the findings of fact were flawed.  Ms Everett,
    for the respondent, submitted that the judge's primary findings of fact
    relating to dependency did not appear to be infected  by  any  material
    error, but conceded that the judge's overall and  operative  Article  8
    analysis was flawed.  I agree that it  was  flawed  for  the  following
    reasons.

14. I find that the operative analysis  by  the  judge  in  dismissing  the
    appeal did not address, in terms, whether Article 8 was engaged or not.
     That was surprising given the judge had identified at [48] that it was
    necessary to consider that very issue.

15. Ms Everett's concession was properly made.   Confusion  arises  because
    the judge appears to make a finding that family life does exist between
    the appellant and the sponsor, stating that it was "split between Nepal
    and the UK".  That appears to suggest that the judge found that  family
    life had been found to continue to exist between the appellant and  the
    sponsor.  The term  "family  life"  has  a  distinct  meaning  in  this
    context,  as  is  readily  apparent  from  the  judge's  self-direction
    relating to the Article 8 jurisprudence, at [51] and also [14] to [17].
     When the judge referred to "family life", she must have been referring
    to the concept as it exists for the purposes of Article 8.

16. The judge's finding at [51], namely that  the  appellant  is  currently
    able to enjoy family life with his mother when she returns to Nepal, is
    unclear.  The judge appeared to find that Article 8 was not engaged  on
    the basis of credibility findings.   However, by  suggesting  that  the
    appellant and his mother are able to enjoy family life when she returns
    to Nepal, taken with the judge's earlier reference at  [50]  to  family
    life being split between Nepal and the UK, it is not clear whether  the
    judge was applying the correct test for the engagement of family  life.
    Ms Everett was right  to  concede  that  this  aspect  of  the  judge's
    decision was not defensible.

17. The approach taken by the judge in the final sentence of  [51]  appears
    to be based on the premise that family life is some form of oscillating
    concept, whereby upon the sponsor returning to Nepal it is revived, and
    upon her returning to this country it somehow ceases.  As a  matter  of
    law, that cannot be correct.  Family life either exists or it does not.
     If it is engaged, it will transcend the distance between Nepal and the
    United Kingdom, whereas if it is not engaged, when the  mother  returns
    to Nepal she will merely enjoy normal emotional ties with her son.

18. It appears that the judge's analysis in  the  final  sentence  of  [51]
    conflated the quite distinct  issues  of,  on  the  one  hand,  whether
    Article 8 is engaged, and, on the other, whether if it is engaged,  any
    interference with it is proportionate.  By  referring  to  family  life
    being enjoyed by the appellant and  the  sponsor  upon  her  return  to
    Nepal, the judge appears in fact to have been addressing the concept of
    proportionality of interference with  family  life,  once  established,
    whereas she presented those findings in the context of making a finding
    that Article 8 was not engaged.  That finding of course conflicted with
    her earlier finding that family life was split between  Nepal  and  the
    United Kingdom.

19. It follows, therefore, that  the  judge's  decision  is  not  clear  in
    relation to whether family life is engaged,  and,  if  so  whether  any
    interference is proportionate.  In this respect, I accept Ms  Everett's
    additional concession that  the  judge  took  into  account  irrelevant
    matters in reaching that decision.  At [46] the judge  had  found  that
    the appellant's father would not have taken the opportunity  to  settle
    in the United Kingdom, had there been an earlier opportunity to do  so,
    on the basis that there was no evidence of what  his  intentions  would
    have been.  Putting aside for one moment how  the  appellant  would  be
    able to adduce evidence concerning what his father may have done, had a
    highly restrictive and subsequently  unlawful  immigration  regime  not
    been in force when he was 2 years old, as Ms Everett notes that was not
    a valid consideration.

20. It follows that this decision must be set aside.  The judge's reasoning
    concerning the engagement of Article 8 is not clear, leaving the reader
    of the decision wondering whether  the  judge  found  the  Article  was
    engaged or not,  and  whether  she  conflated  Article  8(1)  and  (2).
    Secondly, the judge took  into  account  an  irrelevant  consideration,
    namely the intentions of the appellant's father  at  the  time  of  the
    appellant's birth, in the short period that elapsed before  his  father
    died.

21. The question then arises as to whether this  decision  should  this  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, or retained with the  findings  of
    fact preserved in this Tribunal.  While there is considerable force  to
    Ms Everett's submission that the primary findings of  fact  reached  by
    the judge are sound, I consider that this is a case where the  findings
    of fact are entwined with the judge's subsequent Article 8 analysis.  I
    also take into account Mr Khalid's  submission  that  the  sponsor  was
    unrepresented before the First-tier Tribunal.  A  supplementary  appeal
    bundle was submitted for this appeal hearing which featured  pay  slips
    tending to demonstrate that the appellant's income was much higher than
    it had been thought to be by the First-tier  Tribunal  previously.   Of
    course, those new documents are incapable of  going  to  the  issue  of
    whether the judge erred in her findings of fact, which were established
    on the basis of the evidence before her.  It may well be the case  that
    there are good reasons not to treat those documents  as  reliable.   It
    will be necessary to consider whether the  appellant  and  the  sponsor
    could  reasonably  have  been  expected  to  rely  on  those  materials
    previously.  There may be extensive findings of fact to be made.

22. In my judgment, the most appropriate course in light of  the  potential
    for extensive findings of fact, some of which could entail  assessments
    of the credibility of the appellant and sponsor,  notwithstanding  that
    the fact that many of the judges' factual conclusions were  within  the
    range of findings open to her on the evidence, would be to  remit  this
    matter to the First-tier Tribunal with  no  findings  preserved  to  be
    heard by a different judge.

23. I allow this appeal.



Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge G C Solly involved the  making  of
an error of law and is set aside.  The case is remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal to be reheard by  a  different  judge  with  no  findings  of  fact
preserved.

No anonymity direction is made.
