Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms. S Iqbal, instructed by Marsh and Partners
For the Respondent:    Ms. K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against  a  decision  and  reasons  by  First-tier
       Tribunal ("FtT") Judge A W Khan promulgated on 15th September  2016.
       The Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal against a  decision  made
       by the respondent  on  7th  July  2015  to  reject  the  appellant's
       application for a residence card as confirmation  of  the  right  of
       residence,  as  the  extended  family  member  of  an  EEA  national
       exercising treaty rights in the UK.


    2.  The grounds of appeal are twofold.  First, on 19th September  2016,
       the Upper Tribunal published its decision in Sala  (EFMs:  Right  of
       Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC), which establishes that there is  no
       statutory right of appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of
       State not to grant a Residence Card, to a person claiming to  be  an
       Extended Family Member.  Second, if a right of appeal did exist, the
       Judge erred in  his  consideration  of  the  evidence,  and  reached
       findings upon material matters that are  irrational,  and  were  not
       open to him.


    3. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Cruthers  on
       22nd March 2017.  The Judge noted that based on the decision  of  the
       Upper Tribunal in Sala, arguably, there was no right of appeal to the
       FtT.  In granting permission, the Judge expressed no view as  to  the
       merits of the appellant's challenge to the findings made by  the  FtT
       Judge. The matter comes before me to consider whether the decision of
       the FtT Judge involved the making of a material error of law, and  if
       the decision is set aside, to re-make the decision.


    4. At the hearing before me, Ms Iqbal applied for an adjournment of the
       hearing.  She submits that the question as to  whether  a  statutory
       right of appeal exists against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
       State not to grant a Residence Card, is one of  the  matters  to  be
       considered by the Court of Appeal in MK  (Pakistan)  in  July  2017.
       She submits that the issue is also to be considered in  a  reference
       made by the Upper Tribunal to the European Court in SSHD -v- Rozanne
       Banger (C-89/17).  Ms Iqbal  accepts  that  any  decision  from  the
       European Court is some way off, but submits that the hearing of  the
       appeal before me should be adjourned pending  the  decision  of  the
       Court of Appeal.


    5. The application for an adjournment  was  opposed  by  Ms  Pal.   She
       submits  that  Sala  establishes  that  the  refusal   to   exercise
       discretion under Regulation 17(4) of the 2006 EEA Regulations,  does
       not attract a right of appeal, as  it  is  not  an  'EEA  decision'.
       However, here, the Judge also found that the appellant does not meet
       Regulation 8(2)(a) of the 2006 Regulations  as  an  extended  family
       member.


    6. I refused the application for an adjournment.  In my judgement,  the
       decision of the Court of Appeal in the forthcoming appeal will be of
       no assistance to the appellant, and there is nothing to be gained by
       an adjournment.  The appellant's first ground of appeal is that  the
       FtT had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal.  If the appellant is
       correct in her first ground of appeal, and the decision in  Sala  is
       upheld by the Court of Appeal, the Upper  Tribunal  equally  has  no
       jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.   That will be the end of the
       matter.


    7. If, however, the Court of Appeal finds  that  the  decision  of  the
       Upper Tribunal in Sala was wrong and there does  exist  a  statutory
       right of appeal before the FtT,  the  appellant  has  been  able  to
       exercise her statutory right of appeal.  Here, the Judge found  that
       the  appellant  does  not  meet  Regulation  8(2)(a)  of  the   2006
       Regulations as an extended family member.


    8. Having refused the application for an adjournment of the hearing,  I
       went on to hear the parties' submissions upon  the  two  grounds  of
       appeal advanced on behalf of the appellant.


    9. Ms Iqbal maintains that the decision of the Upper Tribunal  in  Sala
       establishes that there is no statutory right of appeal  against  the
       decision of the respondent not to grant a residence card to a person
       claiming to be an  extended  family  member  and  so,  whatever  the
       parties might have thought at the time, there was in fact  no  right
       of appeal.  The FtT had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal.  The
       Tribunal erred in hearing the appeal and its decision should be  set
       aside.


   10. She submits that if the Tribunal  did  have  jurisdiction,  the  FtT
       Judge  makes  findings  that  are  irrational  and  or  inadequately
       reasoned.  She submits that at paragraph [12], the  Judge  fails  to
       give adequate reasons for his finding that  the  appellant  was  not
       financially dependent upon her brother, whilst she was living in Sri-
       Lanka.  She submits that in the appeal of  the  appellant's  sister,
       Diana Varatharaja, the  FtT  Judge  accepted  that  the  appellant's
       sister was financially dependent on  the  same  brother.   Ms  Iqbal
       submits that the decision of the FtT Judge in  the  sister's  appeal
       should have formed the starting point for the Judge's assessment  of
       whether the funds sent by the brother to Sri-Lanka, was evidence  of
       financial dependency in  the  manner  described  by  the  appellant.
       She also submits that the Judge failed to reach an adequate  finding
       regarding the appellant's evidence that she receives ï¿½50 every  week
       from her brother, and has been doing so since 2009, as  evidence  of
       her current dependency on her brother.  Finally,  she  submits  that
       the Judge failed to properly assess the evidence before  him  as  to
       the address at which the appellant claimed to be living,  and  fails
       to give adequate reasons for his  finding  that  the  appellant  had
       practised deception.


   11. The respondent has filed a rule 24 response dated  5th  April  2017.
       The respondent states in the Rule 24 response that  the  appellant's
       claim that the Tribunal did not have  jurisdiction,  proceeds  on  a
       misunderstanding  of  the  ratio  of  the  decision  in  Sala.   The
       respondent claims that the  decision  in  Sala  is  limited  to  the
       discretion to be exercised by the respondent under Article 17(4)  of
       the 2006 Regulations, whereas here,  the  appellant  was  unable  to
       satisfy the requirements of Regulation 8, such that the question  of
       discretion does not arise.  Before me,  Ms  Pal  conceded  that  the
       effect of the decision in Sala is that there is no  statutory  right
       of appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  not  to
       grant a Residence Card, to a  person  claiming  to  be  an  Extended
       Family Member, and the Tribunal had  no  jurisdiction  to  hear  the
       appeal.


   12. Ms Pal submits that in any event, the Judge has  carefully  set  out
       the evidence before him and has reached findings that were  open  to
       him, and given adequate reasons for those findings.  She submits the
       Judge was entitled  to  reject  the  explanations  provided  by  the
       appellant during her evidence as to financial  dependency  upon  her
       bother whilst the appellant  lived  in  Sri  Lanka,  and  since  her
       arrival in the UK.  She submits the Judge carefully  considered  the
       competing and conflicting evidence, and it was open to the Judge  to
       reach the findings that he did, on the evidence before the Tribunal.


 Discussion


   13. The Judge cannot be criticised for dealing with the  appeal  in  the
       way that he did. It  was  commonly  accepted  that  extended  family
       members of EU nationals residing in the  United  Kingdom  enjoyed  a
       statutory right of appeal to the Tribunal against a decision by  the
       respondent to refuse to issue  them  with  a  residence  card.   The
       appellant's appeal was heard on 25th August 2016 and the decision of
       the FtT Judge was promulgated on 15th September 2016.  Neither party
       claimed that there was in fact no right  of  appeal,  and  that  the
       Tribunal therefore had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.


   14. This appeal, like Sala, concerns the right of appeal of an  extended
       family member as defined in Regulation 8 of  the  2006  Regulations.
       Regulation 8(2) defines an  extended  family  member  as  including
       someone who satisfies the conditions in Regulation  8(2).   That  is
       the provision which the appellant in this appeal claimed to satisfy,
       and which the judge concluded, she did not satisfy.   Regulation  17
       provides that the respondent must issue a residence card to a person
       who is not an EEA national and is the family member of  a  qualified
       person or of an EEA national with a  permanent  right  of  residence
       under regulation 15 or to a person who is not an  EEA  national  but
       who is a family member who has  retained  the  right  of  residence.
       However, Regulation 17(4) provides that the respondent may  issue  a
       residence card to an  extended  family  member  not  falling  within
       regulation 7(3) who is not an EEA national on application if (a) the
       relevant EEA national in relation to the extended family member is a
       qualified person or an  EEA  national  with  a  permanent  right  of
       residence under regulation 15; and (b) in all the  circumstances  it
       appears to the respondent appropriate to issue the  residence  card.
       In Sala, the Tribunal held that an extended family member of an  EEA
       national  has  no  right  of  appeal  under  Regulation  26  of  the
       Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006 against  the
       refusal of a residence card. The Tribunal held that  the  rights  of
       extended family members  derive  not  from  EU  law,  but  from  the
       respondent's discretion to  issue  a  residence  card  following  an
       extensive  examination  of  their   personal   circumstances   under
       Regulation 17(5).


   15. The decision of the Upper Tribunal in Sala (EFMs: Right  of  Appeal)
       [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC) was published on 19th September  2016,  just
       four days after the decision of the FtT Judge was promulgated.    It
       is now common ground between the parties  before  me,  that  on  the
       present state of the law, there is  no  statutory  right  of  appeal
       against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  not  to  grant  a
       Residence Card, to a  person  claiming  to  be  an  Extended  Family
       Member.


   16. The FtT had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal and the  decision  of
       the FtT is therefore set aside.


   17. I do not in the circumstances need to consider the remaining grounds
       relied upon by the appellant. However, I  have  carefully  read  the
       paragraphs that the appellant seeks to criticise and the decision as
       a whole. The Judge carefully sets out the evidence  before  him  and
       considers the inconsistencies in the evidence, and the  explanations
       given by the appellant and her brother in their evidence.  It is now
       well established that although there is a legal duty to give a brief
       explanation of the conclusions on the central  issue  on  which  the
       appeal is determined, those reasons need not  be  extensive  if  the
       decision as a whole makes  sense,  having  regard  to  the  material
       accepted by the Judge.   It  is  equally  well  established  that  a
       finding might only be set aside for error of law on the  grounds  of
       perversity if it was irrational or unreasonable  in  the  Wednesbury
       sense, or one that  was  wholly  unsupported  by  the  evidence.  On
       appeal, the Upper Tribunal should not overturn a judgment  at  first
       instance, unless it really could not understand the original judge's
       thought process when the Judge was making  material  findings.    If
       the FtT had had jurisdiction to determine the appeal, I  would  have
       had no hesitation in concluding that the appellant's further grounds
       amount to nothing more than a disagreement with findings  that  were
       properly open to the Judge.


 Notice of Decision


   18. The appeal is allowed.  The decision of FtT Judge  Khan  promulgated
       on 15th September 2016 is set aside.


   19. There is no right of appeal against the respondent's decision.   The
       Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and the  appeal  is
       therefore not admitted.
