Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
point of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal should apply to the  Upper
Tribunal for permission, at the hearing at which the decision is  given.  If
no application is made,  the  Tribunal  must  nonetheless  consider  at  the
hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule 44(4B)  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).

Judge Jackson:

 1. This  is  an  application  for  Judicial  Review  by  Hisham  and  Sana
    Jamarkani,  a  husband  and  wife  resident  in  Syria,   against   the
    Respondent's refusal of  their  applications  for  entry  clearance  as
    visitors to the United Kingdom dated 23 September 2019.  The Interested
    Parties are the Applicants' family members in the United  Kingdom  whom
    they applied for entry clearance to visit.  There is  also  a  document
    stating that Mager Jarmakani (one of the Interested Parties)  has  full
    authority to  conduct  proceedings  on  the  Applicants'  behalf  in  a
    document entitled 'Power of Attorney' dated 20 November 2019.


 2. Whilst this application has been listed for a  substantive  hearing  in
    the Upper Tribunal, the only outstanding issue between the  parties  is
    costs; the decisions under  challenge  having  been  withdrawn  by  the
    Respondent with subsequent further decisions having already  been  made
    to grant entry clearance to both Applicants.  It has been necessary  to
    list an oral hearing as the parties have been unable to agree a form of
    consent to dispose of the application and the  Applicants  refused  the
    offer for the issue of costs to be determined on the papers by a Judge.




 3. In  summary,  the  Applicants  seek  their  reasonable  costs  of  this
    application for Judicial Review and the Respondent seeks no order as to
    costs up to 1 July 2020 and her costs thereafter.  The history of  this
    application for Judicial Review and in particular the  conduct  of  the
    parties throughout, particularly since July 2020, is  relevant  to  the
    assessment of the parties' respective applications for costs and it  is
    therefore necessary to set this out in some detail.


 4. The application for Judicial Review was initially deemed issued  on  31
    December 2019 in the High  Court,  an  earlier  attempt  to  lodge  the
    application having been made in Manchester on 20 December  2019  having
    been returned.  On 28 January 2020, the  High  Court  transferred  this
    application for Judicial Review  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  pursuant  to
    section 31A of the Senior Courts Act 1981, a decision  affirmed  by  Mr
    Justice Supperstone on 10 February 2020 following a  challenge  to  the
    transfer order and a request for reconsideration.


 5. The Applicants' challenged the decisions in relation to  each  of  them
    dated 23 September 2019 (later upheld on review on 27 November 2019 and
    in pre-action correspondence on 10  December  2019)  on  the  following
    grounds.  First, the Respondent's refusals were illegal,  unreasonable,
    unfair and discriminatory, in particular  because  the  Respondent  had
    failed to take into account factors in the Applicants' favour  such  as
    their strong family and cultural links to  their  home  area  in  Syria
    (including caring for their three  year  old  grandson)  and  that  the
    Sponsors are permitted  to  finance  their  visit  in  accordance  with
    paragraph 4.3  of  Appendix  V  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  of  which
    sufficient evidence was provided with the applications.   Further,  the
    Applicants have previously complied with immigration law and the second
    Applicant returned home after a visit in 2009 in  compliance  with  her
    visa.  Secondly, the Respondent's refusals were in breach of Article  8
    of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Thirdly, the  Respondent's
    refusals breached  the  Applicants'  legitimate  expectation  of  being
    granted  visas  having  complied  with  all  of  the  necessary  rules.
    Fourthly, the Respondent's refusals were discriminatory against  Syrian
    nationals contrary to Article 14 in combination with Article 8  of  the
    European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.   Fifthly,  the   Respondent's
    refusals breached section 29 of the Equality Act 2010.


 6. The relief sought  by  the  Applicants  in  their  application  was  as
    follows:


          i) Quashing of SSHD's 23 September 2019 refusals  of  Jarmakanis'
             visitor visa applications;
         ii) SSHD grant Jarmakanis' visitor visas forthwith;
        iii) Indemnity Costs against SSHD (SSHD  failed  to  address  above
             issues despite 2 PAP-Compliant letters from us),

         And as Interim Order:


         iv) HO to disclose to us SSHD's policy and guidance  documents  on
             SSHD's visa streaming process, SSHD's technical information on
             how the algorithm system used to screen visa applicants works,
             and how both have impacted on the Claimants in our  case  (was
             asked for this in both our PAP-Compliant letters, in vain).


 7. The grounds of challenge state that indemnity costs are sought  on  the
    basis that the Applicants have paid $242  for  their  applications  for
    entry clearance and thousands of pounds for help from lawyers  ensuring
    the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  were  met  and  yet  the
    Respondent persisted in refusing the applications and  maintaining  the
    refusals.


 8. In an order dated 10 March 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam refused
    to admit the application for permission to apply for Judicial Review on
    the basis that it was 25 days out of time,  a  significant  breach  for
    which there was no good reason and in any event there was  no  arguable
    error of law in the decision under challenge.


 9. The Applicants sought to apply  to  set-aside  the  decision  of  Upper
    Tribunal Judge McWilliam and renewed their application  for  permission
    to apply for Judicial Review on 27 March 2020.


10. On  22  June  2020,  the  Applicants'  Counsel  objected  to  the  oral
    permission hearing going ahead virtually (rather  than  face  to  face,
    referring to virtual hearings having many disadvantages);  objected  to
    the time estimate of two hours when  the  Applicants  had  consistently
    sought a full day permission hearing and when there was an  outstanding
    application to set aside the permission decision  on  the  papers.  The
    application to set-aside and a further application to adjourn the  oral
    permission hearing were rejected on the basis that  they  were  invalid
    (as they were not accompanied by a fee) and in any event set aside  was
    inappropriate when there was a valid application for oral renewal.  The
    SKYPE video hearing was converted to a telephone one using BTMeetMe and
    the parties were sent the necessary details.


11. Following a hearing on 23 June 2020, in a decision sent to the  parties
    on 7 July 2020 and again on 8 July 2020, Upper Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul
    varied the earlier decision of Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam to  admit
    the Respondent's Acknowledgment of Service and the order made  relating
    to costs.  In regard to the renewed application for  permission,  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Rintoul granted permission to apply for Judicial  Review
    for the following reasons:


          3) It is arguable that the respondent acted irrationally  in  her
             consideration of the material tending to show the  applicant's
             links with Syria; and,  consequently,  acted  irrationally  in
             concluding that the requirements of the Immigration Rules were
             not met.
          4) It is also arguable that, on the particular facts of this case
             where dependency appears to be accepted,  that  there  was  an
             arguable breach of article 8 in terms of  respect  for  family
             life.
          5) It is also  arguable  that,  and  given  that  permission  has
             already been given by the High Court on this issue,  that  the
             respondent  acted  unlawfully  in  the  use  of  the  impugned
             algorithm to make a decision in this case.

12. In  addition,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul  observed  that  as  the
    Applicants' daughter-in-law, Monika, is a Polish citizen as well  as  a
    British Citizen, she falls within  the  definition  of  "EEA  national"
    within  regulation  2  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 (as amended); such that the Applicants  are  dependent
    family members within regulation 7 of the same and entitled  to  family
    permits under regulation 12.   This  was  a  matter  on  which  it  was
    suggested the Applicants may wish to take advice.


13. Finally, Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul  directed  the  parties  to  make
    submissions as to what directions should be made in this case by  close
    of business on 14 July 2020 (amended from the original  order  for  the
    same by 7 July 2020 due to a delay in the decision being  sent  to  the
    parties).


14. On 1 July 2020, the Respondent proposed a draft consent  order  to  the
    Applicants to settle these proceedings on the basis that the Respondent
    would  withdraw  the  decisions   under   challenge,   reconsider   the
    applications within four months (absent special circumstances) and  pay
    the Applicants' reasonable costs, to be assessed if not agreed.  On the
    same date, Mr Rosemarine sought confirmation from the  Respondent  that
    they would agree to pay for his work at a rate of �500  per  hour.   No
    other matters of substance were raised  in  relation  to  the  proposed
    terms of consent at that point or at any later  date.   The  Respondent
    confirmed on 3 July 2020 that the Applicants' reasonable costs would be
    paid, to be assessed if not agreed and noted that costs  are  a  matter
    for  settlement  or  assessment  after  agreement  is  reached  on  the
    substantive issues.  No agreement was reached between  the  parties  at
    this time.


15. The Respondent made written submissions pursuant to the  directions  of
    Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul on 3 July 2020.  These briefly set out the
    history of the claim and the recent correspondence between the  parties
    as to a possible settlement.  The Respondent sought  dismissal  of  the
    application for Judicial Review on the basis that it was  academic  and
    reasonable terms had been offered to settle the  application.   In  the
    alternative,  a  stay  of  proceedings  was   sought   to   allow   the
    reconsideration offered.


16. On 7 July 2020, the Applicants made an application to admit two witness
    statements with accompanying documents in support of an application for
    wasted costs against the Respondent on an indemnity basis.


17. On 8 July 2020, the Upper Tribunal reminded the  Respondent  that  once
    permission has been granted and the requisite fee paid, the application
    for Judicial Review can not be dismissed without  a  hearing  and  both
    parties were reminded of the costs consequences of proceeding  where  a
    settlement has been proposed and it is open to them to agree  that  the
    application be withdrawn for that reason and costs to be determined  by
    a Judge on the papers, or for costs to be assessed if not agreed.


18. In a letter dated 7-13 July 2020, the Applicants' Counsel wrote to  the
    Respondent,  with  the  heading  'Very  Urgent  Letter  Before  Further
    Action', albeit seeking to settle the extant proceedings on  the  basis
    of agreement to (or  something  close  to)  (i)  the  Applicants  being
    granted their visas straightaway; (ii) the Respondent's algorithm being
    discarded or at least suspended pending  the  substantive  decision  in
    JCWI v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department,  and  to  include
    something meaningful to the Applicants about achieving something in the
    national interest through these proceedings; and (iii) indemnity costs,
    if not agreed, to be determined at a face to face  hearing  listed  for
    one day in Manchester.  A list of reasons are given as to  why  it  was
    said that costs had been wasted by  the  Government  Legal  Department,
    which included allegations of intimidation; unreasonable  and  improper
    conduct, including  but  not  limited  to  back-dating  correspondence,
    writing directly to the litigants in person and not to  their  Counsel,
    disingenuously misleading the Applicants and  instructing  a  barrister
    who was also a UTIAC Judge.


19. In a letter addressed to Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul,  dated  14  July
    2020, Mr Rosemarine sought a stay of proceedings and an order requiring
    the Respondent to make a fresh decision within one month; as well as  a
    request for indemnity costs.  A draft order  was  included  (which  had
    been sent to the Respondent on 6 or 7 July 2020), which goes beyond the
    confines  of  this  application  for  Judicial  Review   and   includes
    contradictory provisions as to costs.


20. A formal application was also made by the Applicants on 14  July  2020,
    which was re-made on 30 July 2020, to continue  their  application  for
    Judicial Review; for a stay of proceedings  until  1  month  after  the
    Respondent made a fresh decision on the entry  clearance  applications;
    costs on an indemnity basis and in the event the  proceedings  are  not
    settled, for the substantive hearing to be listed for a  face  to  face
    hearing with a 1 day time estimate in Manchester to save costs (due  to
    Mr Rosemarine being based in Manchester).


21. The accompanying documents also sought (i) exemplary wasted costs on an
    indemnity basis against the Respondent and her agents for 'flagrant and
    prolonged incompetence' (or indemnity costs on any other  basis);  (ii)
    an order for assessment of reasonable costs;  and  (iii)  admission  of
    witness statements from the Applicants and the Interested Parties.


22. The supporting submissions for a wasted costs order include, by way  of
    example as to the matters relied upon (as these are relevant to matters
    later in this decision), the following (not quoted in full primarily to
    avoid repetition and quoted using the original formatting  used  by  Mr
    Rosemarine):


         "1. The Evidence supporting J Wasted Costs claim is substantial and
         clear.  After c40 years of law, I submit this is a clear  cut  case
         of continuing Wasted Costs by SSHD and its agents, for which J seek
         Indemnity Costs.  ...


         2. SSHD has known, from before the Jaramakani JR Applicants applied
         for visas, that the Jarmakani  JR  Applicants  have  an  "automatic
         right to residence in the UK"  as  a  consequence  of  their  being
         "direct family members" of an EEA  national.   SSHD  has  known  it
         because it is made very clear by SSHD's own internal  Guidance  for
         SSHD Staff entitled: "Free Movement Rights: Direct Family Rights of
         EEA Nationals."  That Guidance is itself based upon ECHR's Art  8's
         right to family, and resulting Immigration (European Economic Area)
         Regulations  2016  which  transpose  the  Free  Movement  Directive
         2004/38/EC), and ECtHR  and  ECJ  jurisprudence,  including  Toufiq
         Lounes v SSHD [2017].


         SSHD's Continuing "flagrant and prolonged incompetence" has  wasted
         ALL our costs, ab initio


         3. GLD and SSHD failing to act on this knowledge has wasted ALL our
         costs, ab initio, from SSHD refusing J's visa  applications.   This
         includes the legal costs involved in deciding how to progress  this
         matter; preceding  our  1st  PAP  letter's  cover  email  expressly
         invoking ECHR's Art 8's right to family.  Our ECHR Art 8  Right  to
         Family rights are asserted by us plenitudinously and plentifully in
         our 2019 JR Permission Bundle ... that SSHD knew throughout (or  is
         deemed to know  by  court  precedent)  from  receipt  of  J's  visa
         applications, that Jarmakani parents were "Direct family"  entitled
         to "automatic rights of residence" and thereby automatic rights  of
         entry to the UK.  On that basis, SSHD have wasted all our costs  de
         initio from the very beginning of all work done to consider how  to
         show that RFRL was wrongful.


         Consequently SSHD/GLD should pay indemnity costs for  all  of  work
         done by us all.  A list of authorities  will  follow.   ...  SSHD's
         belated concessions on 1 July 2020 came as a bolt from the blue, in
         that we were fully expecting to go to a full JR  hearing,  as  SSHD
         conceded nothing, nothing, nothing, before 1st July 2020  in  these
         proceedings.


         SSHD's Continuing "flagrant and prolonged  incompetence"  from  its
         1st PAP Reply
         4. SSHD's agent's reply of 27 Nov 2019 to  our  1st  PAP  does  not
         engage with the right to family.  It  doesn't  even  refer  to  it.
         Indeed SSHD's agent's reply is so unsatisfactory  and  in  conflict
         with PAP reply rules, that we immediately twice put SSHD on  notice
         of our seeking Indemnity Costs for it.  ...  Again,  GLD  and  SSHD
         failing to act on all this  knowledge  above  has  wasted  ALL  our
         costs, throughout this  litigation,  from  beginning  to  end,  and
         continuing.  This by itself justifies a Wasted Costs  Order  on  an
         Indemnity basis.


         5. ... Mr Chahal personally, has, in our submission,  misled  Judge
         Rintoul, by claiming that J continuing with this litigation is,  in
         Mr Chahal's own words, "academic" ...


         6. Briefly put, SSHD  and  GLD  ...  have  been  negligent  in  not
         conceding J's JR cases, at every stage since our 1st PAP letter, or
         SSHD and GLD have deliberately concealed their knowledge ...


         7. Yet instead of conceding, SSHD and GLD  have  implacably  fought
         tooth and nail  against  granting  Jarmakani  JR  Applicants  their
         visas.  Mr Chahal himself labelled J's case as "unarguable" ...  We
         submit that Mr Chahal apparently misled the  1st  permission  Judge
         into following Mr Chahal and granting costs against us, wasting our
         costs  by  forcing  us  into  very  much  work  to   reveal   those
         misrepresentations.


         8. Apparently misleading and intimidating  correspondence  from  Mr
         Chahal personally
         9. We've previously submitted that Mr Chahal apparently  misled  us
         into believing that Mr Chahal had posted us his AOS,  whereas  none
         of the Jarmakanis every received such, and I  never  received  such
         until after 6 April 2020 (2 months late), when it  was  accompanied
         by a cover letter apparently back-dated to 14  February  2020.   Mr
         Chahal repeatedly failed to provide any proof of posting or  answer
         to what appears to be substantial back  dating,  combined  with  an
         intimidatory threat of refusal of future visa applications,  unless
         J paid his costs (which Mr  Chahal  had  not  been  granted  on  14
         February 2020)


         ...


         14. GLD's Mr  Chahal's  continuing  negligent  and/or  unreasonable
         misrepresentations, meant to  damage  the  Jarmakanis'  fundamental
         interest
         15. In Mr Chahal's email to UTIAC of 3 July 2020, Mr Chahal  states
         the following, all of which are,  in  our  submissions,  apparently
         negligence and/or unreasonable misrepresentations meant  to  damage
         the Jarmakanis fundamental interest in getting  their  visas  asap,
         and to obstruct the national interest in the current discriminatory
         and unlawful Algorithm, either being abandoned or brought into non-
         discriminatory legality through fair changes to its use.


         16. The misleading statements are as follows:


         17. Mr Preet Chahal: "it is clear that this judicial review is  now
         academic in light of the attached  consent  order".   In  fact,  Mr
         Chahal's consent order bears almost no relation to the  result  and
         orders sought in any of Jarmakanis 3 PAP letters and JR Bundle ...


         18. Mr  Preet  Chahal:  "The  Applicants  ...  has  indicated  that
         settlement depends on whether an hourly rate of �500  per  hour  is
         accepted".  In fact, this was never said by the Applicants.  On the
         contrary, this hourly rate is quoted in The  Applicants  Agreements
         with their Counsel.  Seeking SSHD's payment of it for  the  reasons
         given  to  SSHD  is  reasonable  in  itself,  and  additionally   a
         negotiations' trial balloon (opening trail  balloon  to  test  your
         willingness to settle.)  But Mr Chahal has preferred  to  weaponize
         it.


         ...


         23. To encourage a fast settlement of all remaining issues, and  as
         proof of good will, Jarmakanis are  prepared,  at  this  stage,  to
         settle for Indemnity Costs instead of Exemplary Wasted Costs on  an
         Indemnity Basis.  But they will withdraw their preparedness to make
         this concession, if the matter goes ahead to  a  full  JR  hearing.
         The Jarmakanis and I have tried to be constructive, reasonable  and
         fair, at all stages.


23. On 28 July 2020, this application for Judicial Review  was  struck  out
    for  failure  to  pay  the  continuation  fee;  albeit  this   was   an
    administrative error and overturned  with  the  proceedings  reinstated
    (see below).


24. In an order dated 6 August 2020, Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul  dealt
    with  matters  arising  since  the  grant  of  permission,  making  the
    following decisions:


          1. The application for judicial review, struck  out  on  28  July
             2020, is reinstated.
          2. The application to adduce witness statements is rejected.
          3. The application for a stay is refused.
          4. The application for  the  proceedings  to  be  transferred  is
             refused.
          5. The application for indemnity costs is refused.
          6.  Unless  a  signed  consent  agreement   disposing   of   this
             application, save as to costs, is  served  within  10  working
             days of the issue of this  order,  this  application  will  be
             listed for hearing without further notice and without  further
             directions, it not now being appropriate  to  make  the  usual
             case management directions.
          7. Any communication from the parties must be in  12pt  type  (no
             larger or smaller) without the use  of  underlining,  bold  or
             italics unless used to identify a cited  case  or  within  the
             heading of notepaper.  The Upper Tribunal will reject  without
             consideration any emails, letters,  documents  or  submissions
             which do not comply with this direction.


25. The reasons given for these decisions included, so far as relevant, the
    following:

         1.       ...
         2.       It is noted that this action  is  now  entirely  academic.
             The respondent has offered to reconsider the applications  for
             entry clearance and, it appears, she is no  longer  using  the
             algorithm impugned in the grounds of challenge.  There is  now
             no prospect of the Upper Tribunal making  any  order  in  this
             case, as the applicants' have achieved  all  that  they  could
             reasonably have achieved.  There is no basis on which it could
             realistically be argued that a mandatory order could  be  made
             ordering that entry clearance  be  granted,  nor  any  purpose
             served in a declaration or other order.   The  application  is
             thus academic, and the sole remaining issue is  costs.   While
             it is noted that the applicants do not consider that the offer
             to reconsider is sufficient, an order quashing  the  decisions
             is the only remedy (apart from costs) that could realistically
             have been ordered; and, that would have been some  time  hence
             from the date on which the offer to reconsider within 3 months
             was made.
         3.       The parties are reminded of their duty to assist the Upper
             Tribunal with the overriding  objective  to  deal  with  cases
             fairly  and  justly  (rule  2,  Tribunals   Procedure   (Upper
             Tribunal) Rules 2008).
         4.       No purpose is now served  by  staying  proceedings  or  in
             taking further evidence as costs are the only remaining issue.
              Accordingly, these applications are refused.
         5.       The usual order in cases such as this where  a  reasonable
             offer to settle has been made is for  the  application  to  be
             withdrawn given that agreement and for the respondent  to  pay
             the applicant's reasonable costs to be assessed if not agreed.
         6.       The applicants have  behaved  unreasonably  in  requesting
             that an order for costs be made on  an  indemnity  basis  even
             before the action is brought  to  an  end  still  less  is  it
             reasonable to delay it to get an agreement as  to  the  hourly
             rate applicable for counsel.
         7.       The applicants appear to be unaware that, in continuing to
             litigate, they are at risk of the respondent's costs  incurred
             from the date of the offer to be  set  against  any  award  of
             costs to them.  Further, were  the  matter  to  proceed  to  a
             substantive hearing, these would almost certainly outweigh the
             costs awarded to them, if any, given  that  their  conduct  in
             pursuing this action could be seen as unreasonable.   Further,
             any net costs awarded against them would become  a  litigation
             debt for the purposes of paragraph V.14A  of  the  Immigration
             Rules.  The effect of this would be that any application for a
             visit visa would normally be refused until it was paid.
         8. ...
          9. The parties are again reminded of their  duty  to  assist  the
             Upper Tribunal.   That  includes  presenting  documents  in  a
             coherent and legible form; the Upper Tribunal is not  assisted
             in any way by the use of italics, bold type or typefaces which
             vary in font size or use fonts greater than 12 point.


26. On 10 August 2020, Mr Rosemarine  wrote  to  the  Respondent  with  the
    heading '2nd Very Urgent Letter Before  Further  Action'  stating  that
    until visas are received by the Applicants, the  real  dispute  is  not
    settled and unless agreement  was  reached  within  four  working  days
    (including the date of the letter)  to  the  visas  being  granted,  an
    application would be made to transfer proceedings to the High Court and
    amend the grounds of challenge.  The letter goes on to make  a  request
    for a family permit to be issued under Regulation 12 of the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 although it  is  acknowledged
    that no formal online application had been completed for the  same,  as
    would normally be required.


27. On 17 August 2020, the Applicants made a formal  application  to  amend
    their grounds of claim, seeking a remedy of either a grant of the entry
    clearance applications  or  a  legally  valid  refusal  forthwith;  and
    damages for breaches of the Equality Act 2010 and/or Article 8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights for failure  thus  far  to  make  a
    lawful decision on the entry clearance applications.  The  applications
    were made on the basis that the Applicants  had  already  informed  the
    Respondent on 10 August 2020 that the real dispute between them was not
    settled; the withdrawal of the  decisions  under  challenge  not  being
    enough to bring proceedings to an end.  Further applications were  made
    for the substantive  hearing  to  be  listed  in  Manchester  where  Mr
    Rosemarine is based before a  non-Field  House  Judge  (given  previous
    complaints of apparent bias against a Judge in  Field  House)  and  for
    Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul to be recused because of apparent bias.


28. In an order dated  18  August  2020,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kopieczek
    refused the further applications made by  the  Applicants,  summarising
    and endorsing the decisions and explanations given  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Rintoul in his decision dated 6 August 2020.  The application  to
    amend the grounds of claim  was  refused  as  was  the  application  to
    transfer the proceedings to Manchester; and so far  as  necessary,  the
    application for Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul to be recused was  refused
    because the allegation of bias was wholly  without  merit  and  in  any
    event, as the Judge granting permission, he would  not  deal  with  the
    substantive hearing.  Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek further stated:


         ...
         10. In case it is not already clear from Judge Rintoul's  decision
             dated 6 August 2020, the applicants  should  be  in  no  doubt
             about the consequences for them in terms of costs, in  pursing
             this claim to a substantive hearing in circumstances where the
             claim is now academic.  The respondent's costs are  likely  to
             be substantial.
         11. The same applies in the event that all that is  considered  at
             the  substantive  hearing  is  costs.   A   hearing   is   not
             appropriate only to consider the matter of costs.  If that  is
             all that is considered at the hearing, the  applicants  should
             not consider themselves immune from an  adverse  costs  order,
             because costs can readily  be  dealt  with  on  the  basis  of
             written submissions.
         12. The applicants are also  reminded  of  paragraph  7  of  Judge
             Rintoul's decision  dated  6  August  2020.   The  application
             notice to which this present decision relates, does not accord
             with his direction in terms of font size and bold type.
         13. In the event that there  is  no  hearing,  any  written  costs
             submissions from either party must not exceed two sides of A4,
             and Judge Rintoul's paragraph applies equally in that respect.


29. On 18 September 2020, the Applicants  sent  what  was  described  as  a
    seventh  pre-action  protocol  letter  to  the  Respondent  about   the
    continuing failure to grant  visas  following  a  further  request  for
    information  to  reconsider  the  applications  and  stating  that  the
    application for Judicial Review would be pursued until  the  visas  are
    granted.


30. On 23 September 2020, the Respondent indicated to the  Applicants  that
    their applications for entry clearance had been granted with  practical
    arrangements in process for the issue of the visas.


31. On 25 September 2020, the Applicants wrote to  the  Respondent  with  a
    draft consent order to settle this application for Judicial Review.  It
    asserted that the Applicants are  entitled  to  compensation  from  the
    Respondent but in the interests of being ever reasonable and avoiding a
    hearing, this is not  pursued  in  the  form  of  consent.   The  terms
    proposed were as follows:

         UPON the Respondent granting, on 23 September 2020, the Applicants'
         visa applications fully filed with  the  Respondent  on  10  August
         2019, and the Respondent conceding the Applicants' Judicial  Review
         suit in its entirety, and that the Judicial Review proceedings were
         rightfully brought, and continued to date;


         BY CONSENT, it is ordered that:-


          0. The substantive hearing listed for 2 October 2020 be vacated.
          1. The Respondent's refusal decisions of 23  September  2019  are
             hereby quashed, and Applicants do have leave to  withdraw  the
             above-numbered claim for judicial review.
          2. The Respondent do pay the Applicants' reasonable costs of this
             judicial review, to be  assessed  in  detail  if  not  agreed,
             assessment to be by a Manchester Costs Judge at a face-to-face
             oral hearing, listed for 1 day (Jarmakanis'  costs  for  which
             hearing itself to be paid by Respondent.)
             [Explanation: Both Applicants' and  both  Interested  Parties'
             Barrister, the Family's only immigration lawyer for c8  years,
             consulted and deeply involved at all stages  in  this  heavily
             documented case since September 2019, is Manchester based,  as
             are 3 witnesses to work done.  The Manchester Barrister is  in
             a  high  risk  Coronavirus  category  after   life-threatening
             condition, is old (58 in October 2020), and has  been  advised
             not to travel outside of Manchester.  He does not  drive.   It
             would jeopardize his life for the  assessment  to  be  outside
             Manchester.]
          3. The Applicant's claims for wasted costs  to  be  paid  by  the
             Respondent on an indemnity basis are to be assessed as  above,
             if not agreed.


32. A skeleton argument and bundle of documents was filed on behalf of  the
    Applicants on 28 September 2020 in preparation for the  hearing  listed
    on 2 October 2020 (later  updated  on  1  October  2020),  including  a
    background summary of the case, continued allegations of misconduct  by
    the Secretary of State and/or her  legal  representatives  and  in  the
    absence of agreement between the parties to settle the matter, a  draft
    order of what was, at that date, sought by the Applicants.   The  draft
    order was in the following terms:


         UPON the Respondent granting, on 23 September 2020, the Applicants'
         visa applications fully filed with  the  Respondent  on  10  August
         2019, and the Respondent conceding the Applicants' Judicial  Review
         suit,  the  Judicial  Review  proceedings  having  been  rightfully
         brought, and continued to date;


         It is ordered that:-
          1. The Respondent's refusal decisions of 23  September  2019  are
             both hereby quashed.
          2. The Respondent do pay the Applicants' reasonable costs of this
             judicial review, to be  assessed  in  detail  if  not  agreed,
             assessment to be by a Manchester Costs Judge at a face-to-face
             oral hearing, listed for 1 day (Jarmakanis'  costs  for  which
             hearing itself to be paid by the Respondent.)
             [Explanation: Both Applicants' and  both  Interested  Parties'
             Barrister, the Family's only immigration lawyer for c8  years,
             consulted and deeply involved at all stages  in  this  heavily
             documented case since September 2019, is Manchester based,  as
             are 3 witnesses to work done.  The Manchester Barrister is  in

             not to travel outside of Manchester.  He does not  drive.   It
             would jeopardize his life for the  assessment  to  be  outside
             Manchester.]
          3. The Applicants' claims for wasted costs up to,  and  including
             today, all be paid by the Respondent on  an  indemnity  basis,
             and are to be assessed as above, if not agreed.
          4. The Respondent do pay the Applicants �10,000 on account within
             1 month  towards  the  Applicants'  legal  costs,  under  Rule
             10(10).
             [The Applicants' lawyer has done hundreds of hours of work  in
             this case of national importance  -  the  first  to  be  given
             permission to JR  the  Respondent's  Algorithm,  necessitating
             very great research, because of the Respondent's  refusals  to
             provide  Applicant  with   any   of   Respondent's   Algorithm
             documentation.]
          5. The Respondent never again hire a  UTIAC  Judge  who  sits  in
             Field House, London, for any proceedings there.
             [In  the  national  interest,  but  not  essential   for   the
             Jarmakanis].


33. By way of e-mail dated 30 September 2020, the  Applicants  appeared  to
    apply for the hearing listed at 10am on 2 October 2020 to be  moved  to
    the Manchester High Court if the Respondent had not by  then  signed  a
    consent order in relation to these proceedings.  As above,  a  previous
    application to transfer these proceedings to Manchester was refused  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek in a decision dated 18 August  2020  and
    no new or further reasons were given for the repeat application at this
    very late stage; nor were any reasons given as to  why  a  remote  oral
    hearing was not appropriate or accessible to the parties or why a  face
    to face hearing was required (particularly in  circumstances  where  Mr
    Rosemarine claimed to be vulnerable and a remote  hearing  offers  much
    greater protection against the spread of Covid-19).


34. I refused that application in a decision dated 30  September  2020  for
    these reasons and because the hearing was in any event academic save as
    to costs and wholly unsuited  for  an  oral  hearing  at  all  (whether
    remotely or in person) and the pursuance of the same was  unreasonable.
    The parties were again reminded of  their  duty  to  assist  the  Upper
    Tribunal with the overriding objective and that in this case, there was
    no good reason why the application for Judicial  Review  could  not  be
    settled by consent with provision for assessment of costs on the  basis
    of written submissions if this could not be agreed.  The  parties  were
    directed to file written costs submissions, accompanied by  a  schedule
    of costs by no later than midday on 1 October 2020 for  the  matter  of
    costs to be determined at a hearing if that remained necessary and  for
    summary assessment of costs to be undertaken.


35. On 30 September 2020, the Respondent, referring  to  the  order  above,
    sought confirmation  from  the  Applicants  as  to  whether  they  were
    agreeable to a withdrawal of proceedings with the issue of costs to  be
    determined on the basis of written submissions.


36. On 30 September 2020, the Applicants filed an application  notice  with
    the Upper Tribunal.  On its face, the  form  failed  to  identify  what
    order was sought or why, referring only to three  of  the  eight  pages
    attached to the application.  Within those pages, it is stated that the
    Applicants welcomed and agreed with the comments in my  decision  dated
    30 September 2020 that "... a substantive hearing on 2 October 2020  is
    wholly inappropriate to resolve the only  outstanding  issue  of  costs
    between the parties and that there is no good reason for the matter not
    to be settled by consent in the usual way, for the  application  to  be
    withdrawn and agreement for  the  Respondent  to  pay  the  Applicant's
    reasonable costs to be assessed, if not  agreed."  albeit  my  decision
    continued "In the alternative, for the application to be withdrawn  and
    costs (including any application for wasted costs) to be determined  on
    the papers  by  an  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  on  the  basis  of  written
    submissions ...".


37. It was further stated that the Applicants had, on  29  September  2020,
    signed two  different  draft  consent  orders  and  sent  them  to  the
    Respondent; which she failed to sign.  The Applicants  maintained  that
    it was the Respondent acting unreasonably in not signing either consent
    order and that they have repeatedly sought to avoid the  need  for  any
    hearing.  The Applicants requested that  whether  or  not  the  consent
    order(s) are agreed, the hearing be vacated on the basis  that  nothing
    useful can come out of it.  There was however no  proposal  as  to  how
    this application for Judicial  Review  could  be  concluded  without  a
    hearing in the  absence  of  an  agreed  consent  order  and  no  other
    suggestion or request made as to what should happen if the hearing were
    to be vacated.


38. The first consent order proposed was in the following terms:


         UPON the Respondent granting, on 23 September 2020, the Applicants'
         visa applications fully filed with  the  Respondent  on  10  August
         2019, and the Respondent conceding the Applicants' Judicial  Review
         suit and Applicants' reasonable costs,


         BY CONSENT, it is ordered that:-


          0. The substantive hearing listed for 2 October 2020 be vacated.
          1. The Respondent's refusal decisions of 23  September  2019  are
             hereby quashed, and Applicants do have leave to  withdraw  the
             above-numbered claim for judicial review.
          2. The Respondent do pay the Applicant's reasonable costs of this
             judicial review, to be  assessed  in  detail  if  not  agreed,
             assessment to be by a Manchester Costs Judge at a face-to-face
             oral hearing, listed for 1 day (Jarmakanis'  reasonable  costs
             for which hearing itself be paid by the Respondent.)


39. The  second  consent  order  signed  by  the  Applicants  proposed  the
    following terms:


         UPON the Respondent agreeing to withdraw  her  decisions  dated  23
         September 2019 refusing entry clearance as visitors and agreeing to
         reconsider those decision (sic) within 4 months of this order being
         sealed (absent special circumstances);


         BY CONSENT, it is ordered that:-


          1. The Applicants do have leave to  withdraw  the  above-numbered
             claim for judicial review.
          2. The Respondent do pay the Applicant's reasonable costs of this
             judicial review, to be assessed if not agreed.


40. There was no explanation at all of why two alternative forms of consent
    were proposed which contained materially different terms.   The  second
    consent order was essentially that offered by the Respondent on 1  July
    2020 and rejected at the time and was, by 29  September  2020,  out  of
    date and its terms  had  been  overtaken  by  subsequent  events.   The
    Applicants offered no reason as to why the terms were now, nearly three
    months later, acceptable or appropriate whereas there was no  agreement
    to the same when originally proposed.


41. Finally, the documents simply  state  it  will  take  weeks  to  submit
    details of the costs of hundreds of hours work done on this application
    over more than a year and given that the documentation is considerable,
    the claim is not appropriate for summary assessment of costs.


42. In a decision dated 1 October 2020, I refused  the  Applicants'  formal
    application to adjourn the hearing listed for 2 October  2020  for  the
    reasons already given on 30 September 2020 and because the  only  issue
    remaining having been costs since 7 July 2020, there was no  reason  as
    to why the parties had not fully prepared to deal with that sole  issue
    at the hearing, forced by their unreasonable failure to agree a form of
    consent.  The suggestion that there was insufficient time  within  that
    period was rejected and the lack  of  compliance  with  the  procedural
    rules and Upper Tribunal directions was noted.


43. On the morning of the substantive hearing,  the  Applicants  lodged  an
    application notice applying for all of their costs of this  application
    for Judicial Review to be paid for by the Respondent for the reasons to
    be  given  separately  by  Counsel.   This   application   was   wholly
    unnecessary, the Applicants having originally sought costs as  part  of
    the remedy in their initial claim and in circumstances where  they  had
    also made multiple applications in relation to costs already.


44. The submissions on behalf of the Applicants from Mr Rosemarine set  out
    what are described as  'fundamental  errors  of  law'  by  Field  House
    Immigration  Judges.   These  included  the  classification   of   this
    application for Judicial Review  as  academic  since  the  Respondent's
    offer to withdraw and reconsider the decision  in  July  2020,  on  the
    basis that mere withdrawal was not sufficient  in  circumstances  where
    the Applicants  sought  the  grant  of  their  applications  for  entry
    clearance  as  visitors,  indemnity  costs  and   disclosure   of   the
    'discriminatory algorithm policy and guidelines documents' which it  is
    said are in the national interest and of national importance.  Further,
    the withdrawal of the decision under challenge  was  submitted  not  to
    have  any  impact  on  the  Respondent's  continuing  breach   of   the
    Applicants' right to respect for family life under  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights, the Immigration (European Economic
    Area) Regulations 2016 and the Equality Act 2010 which it is  said  are
    fully pleaded aspects of this claim; together with a continuing  breach
    of the Respondent's own guidance on the time taken  to  determine  visa
    applications.  On behalf of the Applicants it was  submitted  that  the
    Respondent  unreasonably  sought  further  evidence  to  determine  the
    applications for entry clearance  and  that  if  the  claim  was  truly
    academic, then further proceedings would have been needed to deal  with
    this and other matters.


45. Mr Rosemarine additionally submitted that both he personally,  as  well
    as the Applicants, had a legitimate expectation of the reasonable costs
    of this application being paid by the Respondent who is  estopped  from
    withdrawing the previous offer to do so.  Mr Rosemarine  asserted  that
    it would be unjust, unreasonable and unfair to deprive  the  Applicants
    of legal  fees  paid  and  owing;  with  detrimental  reliance  on  the
    Respondent's offer by the Applicants and by  Mr  Rosemarine  personally
    (who relies on medical evidence as to his own ability to work  on  this
    application and who states he did  not  chase  fees  owed  to  him  and
    declined work from other clients with confidence  that  the  Respondent
    would be paying for the work he had undertaken on this application).


46. Finally, it is asserted that there is an inequality  of  arms  in  this
    case because the Respondent has had a greater number of lawyers working
    on this case than the elderly, foreign, non-English speaking Applicants
    have had, relying only on one elderly Counsel.


47. The submissions on behalf of the Applicants are accompanied by what  is
    described as a schedule of costs, but is in fact nothing of  the  sort.
    The document contains a list of reasons as to  why  in  excess  of  112
    hours of work was undertaken by  Mr  Rosemarine  on  this  application,
    requiring his particular combination of expertise, legal and linguistic
    skills in what is said to be a very complex and ground breaking  claim.
    There follows a list of broad headings of work  and  estimates  of  the
    time spent on each by Counsel, with in excess of 93 hours  prior  to  8
    July 2020 (a significant part of which was pre-action) and in excess of
    20  hours   since   8   July   2020,   including   further   pre-action
    correspondence.  Counsel's hourly rate claimed is �300, although he has
    been instructed at a rate of �500 per hour.  Including  court  fees  of
    �154, the total claim for costs is  �33,754.   Finally,  it  is  simply
    stated that the Applicants can not afford to pay the Respondent's costs
    and if ordered to do so, they would  be  prevented  from  visiting  the
    United Kingdom, defeating the purpose of the application  for  Judicial
    Review.


The Applicants' position


48. In summary, as set out in the updated  skeleton  argument  filed  on  1
    October 2020, the Applicants stated that they continued to object to  a
    substantive hearing on 2 October 2020  and  have  repeatedly  tried  to
    settle this application for  Judicial  Review  by  consent  once  their
    principal goal of visas being granted had been achieved and since then,
    the Respondent has acted unreasonably in refusing to agree to the  form
    of consent offered.  The Applicants continue to seek  their  reasonable
    costs on an indemnity basis from 27 November  2019  (the  date  of  the
    Respondent's first pre-action response) up to and including the hearing
    on 2 October 2020 and reasonable costs for the period 23 September 2019
    to the date on which costs are paid.  The Applicants assert  that  they
    cannot afford any further costs without the Respondent  paying  towards
    the necessary costs of detailed assessment and therefore  seek  payment
    of �10,000 on account towards their much greater reasonable costs.


49. The Applicants' skeleton argument also alleges bad faith, flagrant  and
    prolonged incompetence, a breach of duty  of  candour  and  conspicuous
    unfairness amounting to an abuse of power against the Respondent and/or
    her legal representatives.  The  Applicants  continue  to  assert  that
    their original applications for  entry  clearance  provided  sufficient
    evidence to show that they fully complied with the requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules (albeit later it is  accepted  that  because  of  the
    further  work  in  response  to  a  request  for  more  evidence,   the
    applications were granted), the request for further  information  prior
    to the grant of  visas  was  unnecessary  and  pursued  in  bad  faith,
    designed to set a trap for the Applicants and disrupt  the  preparation
    needed for this application  and  it  was  reasonable  to  pursue  this
    application  for  Judicial  Review  until  visas  were   granted,   the
    Respondent being wrong to state  previously  that  the  Applicants  had
    already been offered all  they  could  expect  to  achieve  from  these
    proceedings.  It is said that if the Applicants had previously  settled
    in July 2020, they would  have  immediately  had  to  bring  a  further
    application for Judicial Review on almost identical legal grounds.

The Respondent's position


50. In summary, the Respondent's position is that  an  entirely  reasonable
    offer of settlement was made to the Applicants, originally  on  1  July
    2020 and formally renewed on 15  September  2020  (with  limitation  on
    costs to 1 July 2020 only).  The  terms  of  the  draft  consent  order
    provided the Applicants with the relief to which they would be entitled
    if they were ultimately successful in  this  application  for  Judicial
    Review, together with payment of their reasonable costs (up to the date
    of offer of settlement).  The Applicants have rejected the offers  made
    and made repeated applications for wasted and/or indemnity costs,  even
    after the refusal of the application for indemnity costs  on  6  August
    2020.


51. The Respondent withdrew the decisions under challenge and  reconsidered
    the applications  made;  with  the  Applicants  being  informed  on  23
    September 2020 that the applications would  be  granted  (the  physical
    visas themselves having subsequently been issued).


52. The Respondent submits that the Applicants' conduct of this application
    for Judicial Review has been unreasonable to such an extent that  there
    should not be a costs award in their favour at  all  and  in  addition,
    that the Respondent should be awarded her costs from the date of  offer
    of reconsideration of the decisions under challenge  on  1  July  2020.
    Finally, the Respondent sought again on 30 September  2020  to  resolve
    this application by consent with provision  for  the  only  outstanding
    issue of costs  to  be  determined  on  the  papers  following  written
    submissions by the parties, but this was refused.


53. The following factors are highlighted  by  the  Respondent  as  to  the
    Applicants' unreasonable conduct throughout these proceedings.   First,
    the Applicants refused to  accept  a  reasonable  offer  as  to  costs,
    instead persisting in multiple applications for wasted and/or indemnity
    costs and despite guidance from the Upper Tribunal being  given  as  to
    the reasonableness of the offers made.


54. Second, the Applicants made multiple applications to the Upper Tribunal
    and ignored orders in response to them.


55. Third, the Applicants  made  costs  applications  which  were  entirely
    unfounded.   The  Respondent's  conduct  has   been   entirely   proper
    throughout these proceedings and does not form any basis for  an  award
    of indemnity or wasted costs.  In particular, the Applicants' assertion
    that the Respondent's failure to recognise rights under the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016  amounted  to  "flagrant  and
    prolonged incompetence" formed no part of the  Applicants'  application
    for Judicial Review.


56. Fourth, the number and manner of applications made  by  the  Applicants
    caused the Respondent to incur significant additional costs.


57. Fifth, even prior to the Applicants' grant of permission, their conduct
    justified an award of costs against them.   The  grounds  of  challenge
    were diffuse, not in good order and repetitive.   The  application  for
    Judicial Review was lodged out of time, with  attempts  being  made  to
    issue in the High Court twice and with no good reason  for  the  delay.
    These matters all increased the Respondent's costs in dealing with this
    application.


58. Sixth, the Respondent is concerned that the Applicants' Counsel  claims
    to have worked "round-the-clock" on  this  case  since  September  2020
    (presumably 2019), suggesting an  unreasonably  and  disproportionately
    high costs bill, only to be increased by the repeated  requests  for  a
    one day hearing for detailed assessment of  costs  in  relation  to  an
    application which did not proceed beyond the permission stage (save  as
    for costs).


59. Seventh, the Applicants  have  inexplicably  focused  throughout  these
    proceedings  on  obtaining  indemnity  costs  from  the  Respondent  in
    circumstances where there is nothing out of the ordinary  in  terms  of
    the Respondent's conduct which would justify any such order.

The hearing

60. The substantive hearing was held remotely, by video,  using  Skype,  to
    take precautions against  the  spread  of  Covid-19  and  as  the  sole
    remaining issue of costs  should  have  been  a  relatively  short  and
    straightforward issue which could be determined  by  remote  means  (or
    much more appropriately, on the papers as no substantive hearing at all
    should have been required in this claim).  The file  contained  all  of
    the documents in paper format,  with  electronic  copies  of  the  most
    recent documents and bundle also filed  and  available  electronically.
    The parties confirmed that the Upper Tribunal had all of  the  relevant
    documents, as did they.


61. The Applicants have, on a number of occasions, including on the day  of
    the hearing, objected to the use of Skype for a  remote  video  hearing
    and maintained a request for a full day face to face hearing listed  in
    Manchester for the convenience of their Counsel.   Formal  applications
    for the same were made repeatedly and refused by the Upper Tribunal  on
    every occasion (as detailed above).  The Respondent did not  object  to
    the means of hearing.


62. Just prior to the start of the hearing, the Applicants stated that they
    had not received the Skype invite for the hearing.  This  was  sent  to
    the e-mail address on record for Mager Jarmakani initially on 18 August
    2020 and resent on the morning of the hearing.  Those details must have
    been received as he and Mr Rosemarine (as direct access  Counsel)  were
    present remotely using the log in details provided.


63. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Rosemarine stated that he  was  unable
    to join the hearing by video on Skype, for reasons  which  he  did  not
    fully elaborate on and was therefore dialling in by telephone  instead.
    I offered a short adjournment and assistance from the Upper Tribunal to
    allow Mr Rosemarine to join the video  call  if  there  were  technical
    difficulties that could be resolved,  which  was  declined;  as  was  a
    similar offer just prior to the adjournment over lunch.


64. In the absence of any specific reasons given to me  at  or  before  the
    hearing (although there was some reference to reasons having been given
    on some unspecified earlier date to the Upper Tribunal),  in  light  of
    the earlier refusals of the request for a  face  to  face  hearing  and
    given that all parties were able to log in either by  phone  or  video;
    the hearing proceeded as listed.


65. During the course of the hearing, there were occasional difficulties in
    Mr Rosemarine and I hearing each other which were raised at the time by
    those  unable  to  hear  and  with  anything  missed   being   repeated
    immediately following any issue being raised.  I am satisfied that  all
    such issues were dealt with sufficiently at the time.  There are  small
    or short parts of the dialogue not fully picked  up  by  the  recording
    equipment in court situated away  from  where  I  was  sat,  but  I  am
    satisfied that I was able to hear all of the submissions made and  have
    my own written record of proceedings reflecting that.


66. Shortly before the adjournment for lunch  and  again  just  afterwards,
    there were significant difficulties in hearing  Mr  Rosemarine  to  the
    extent that investigations were undertaken to find an alternative means
    to  continue  the  hearing  whereby  everyone  could  hear  each  other
    sufficiently.  In the end, it is understood that an  alternative  phone
    line was used by Mr Rosemarine to connect to the  hearing  and  matters
    then proceeded without any further  significant  difficulties.   Again,
    submissions were repeated  as  needed  and  clarification  obtained  on
    matters that had not previously been heard in full.  The hearing lasted
    for almost a full court day solely  on  the  issue  of  costs,  but  no
    additional matters in relation to  the  audio  quality  or  substantive
    matters that had not been covered were raised in the time available  at
    the end of the hearing.


67. After the hearing, on 4 October 2020 and re-sent on 5 October 2020,  Mr
    Rosemarine e-mailed the Upper  Tribunal  with  a  complaint  about  the
    quality of the hearing stating that many times he  could  neither  hear
    myself nor Ms Thelen and that I had stated the same during the hearing.
     It was suggested that a solution to the  problems  would  be  proposed
    within a few days and in the  meantime,  a  request  was  made  not  to
    finalise this decision.  Other matters of complaint were raised in this
    correspondence  which  are  not  relevant  to  the  hearing  itself  or
    substantive matters in issue within this application such that I do not
    address them here.  Similarly, Mr Rosemarine sent a further e-mail on 6
    October 2020 referring to the quality of the audio during  the  hearing
    and attaching a one page summary document  as  to  why  the  Applicants
    distrusted the Home  Office  to  assist  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  the
    Respondent.  This document raised nothing further of substance relevant
    to the application for Judicial  Review  which  had  not  already  been
    raised in oral submissions.


68. There was no further  communication  on  the  issue  of  audibility  of
    proceedings during the hearing  until  much  later  in  relation  to  a
    transcript of proceedings (which I return to below), nor has there ever
    been any proposed solution that I was asked to await.  I  am  satisfied
    that the issues  with  the  audio  did  not  go  beyond  those  already
    addressed above and rectified at the time during the hearing, such that
    no further action on this is required.


69. On recommencement of the hearing in the afternoon, Mr Rosemarine stated
    that there had been a dramatic development over the lunch  adjournment,
    that he  had  received  a  short  whatsapp  message  from  one  of  the
    Interested Parties which he sought permission to play or permission for
    him to repeat the contents of the same to the  Tribunal.   The  message
    was said to concern the reasonableness of the  Applicants'  refusal  to
    sign the consent order proposed in early July 2020.  This  was  further
    to an application being made at 13:40, by Mager Jarmakani (in the  name
    of Hisham Jarmakani) to allow  Mager  Jarmakani  to  speak  during  the
    hearing.  There was no explanation of the purpose of  the  application,
    whether it was to give evidence or for some other reason; there was  no
    accompanying written statement; no explanation as to the subject matter
    of what was to be covered and no explanation at all let alone any  good
    reason for  the  timing  of  the  application  during  the  substantive
    hearing; nor why the application was any different to those  previously
    made to rely on written evidence  from  Mager  Jarmakani  (and  others)
    which had been refused (as set out above).  The formal application  had
    not reached me by the time the hearing had resumed,  nor  had  it  been
    received by Ms Thelen or those instructing her.   The  application  was
    then forwarded to myself and the Respondent during the hearing.


70. I refused the application on the basis that  it  consisted  only  of  a
    single sentence requesting permission to give evidence with no  reasons
    whatsoever,  no  written  statement  and  no  indication  of  why   the
    application was made only during the course of the substantive hearing.
     Mr Rosemarine however continued to pursue a request for the Interested
    Party to be heard, or to instead play or read out the further  evidence
    from a whatsapp message and referred to witness statements having  been
    given previously (albeit permission had previously been refused to rely
    on the same).  The application had already been  refused,  the  further
    submissions were inappropriate and Mr Rosemarine was asked to  continue
    with the substantive matters in the hearing.


71. Also during the course of the hearing, Mr Rosemarine  made  submissions
    that I would inevitably be influenced by the earlier decisions  of  two
    other  Upper  Tribunal  Judges;  neither  of  whom,  he  alleged,   had
    considered the Applicants' position.  The inference appeared to be that
    either I was biased or somehow  not  approaching  this  hearing  in  an
    impartial way, such that I clarified with Mr Rosemarine  whether  there
    was any such specific accusation or any application for  me  to  recuse
    myself.  Mr Rosemarine stated that he did not say that I was biased  or
    impartial, only that we are all influenced by the decisions  of  others
    and in this case, those others did not consider the Applicants' side of
    the question and were deprived of their right to be  heard,  which  has
    become a  major  issue.   Mr  Rosemarine's  submissions  were  entirely
    unclear, unsupported and  inappropriate;  but  on  the  basis  that  he
    expressly confirmed no formal concerns of  bias  or  impartiality  were
    being made and no application for recusal, the hearing continued.

Submissions on behalf of the Applicants

72. At the outset of the hearing, I  summarised  my  understanding  of  the
    issues in the proceedings, being one  of  costs  only  given  that  the
    substantive matters in the claim  were,  as  previously  identified  by
    Upper Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul  and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kopieczek,
    entirely academic.  Mr Rosemarine opened  his  submissions  by  stating
    that I had totally misconceived the  issues;  that  the  claim  is  not
    academic even as at the date of  hearing  because  the  Applicants  had
    still not physically received their visas.  Mr Rosemarine proceeded  to
    state that the Upper Tribunal was both complacent and complicit in  the
    Home Office breaches and submitted "Ma'am, there's a  deadly  virus  in
    your Tribunal.  It's highly contagious.  Your Tribunal  has  caught  it
    from the Home Office ...",  essentially  suggesting  that  I  had  been
    infected with a virus spread from my colleagues who had caught it  from
    the Home Office.  That was a wholly unprofessional and unnecessary  way
    to begin what should have been impartial, objective  legal  submissions
    on the issue of costs and a statement made  in  thoroughly  poor  taste
    given the Covid-19 pandemic.


73. I pause here before returning to the content of the submissions made to
    deal with a discrete point which arises as to the submissions  recorded
    above.  Following the hearing, there was a submission by Ms Naik QC  on
    behalf of Mr Rosemarine to remove the  latter  part  of  the  paragraph
    immediately above from the  judgment,  which  I  decline  to  do.   The
    request was made in the context  of  written  representations  made  in
    response to a notice to show cause addressed  to  Mr  Rosemarine  which
    followed the circulation of an initial draft judgment  provided  on  an
    embargoed basis for the usual corrections  and  to  allow  for  a  full
    response to the notice to show cause.  The  request  was  made  on  the
    basis that Mr Rosemarine had not made any such submission about a virus
    but instead had read from a script which said "SSHDS's  Jarmakani-visa-
    virus - a virus that stops Jarmakranis' c16+ year old  attempt  to  see
    their sons" and suggesting that  Mr  Rosemarine  was  therefore  either
    misheard or misunderstood due to the audio issues in the hearing and he
    was not given  an  opportunity  to  complete  this  submission.   These
    representations  were  maintained  despite  Mr  Rosemarine  and   those
    representing him not taking the opportunity given  to  them,  at  their
    request, to listen to the audio recording to check the factual accuracy
    of the approved transcript which recorded this submission.


74. I am satisfied that there were no audio difficulties around this  point
    in the hearing such that the submission was in any way misheard (and as
    above,  I  am  overall  satisfied  that  at  points  where  there  were
    difficulties in audibility, these were immediately resolved during  the
    hearing).  This judgment is drafted on the basis of what I heard during
    the substantive hearing, the accuracy  of  which  is  supported  by  an
    approved transcript of the hearing and the audio recording  from  which
    it was transcribed.  The submission actually made by Mr Rosemarine  was
    that recorded in paragraph 70 above, it was not misheard or in any  way
    misunderstood and for the reasons which are  self-evident,  was  wholly
    inappropriate and unprofessional.  In these circumstances, the  request
    to remove part of a draft judgment was inappropriate  and  without  any
    proper evidential foundation.


75. On the actual matters arising in the case, Mr Rosemarine submitted that
    the claim was not academic because although the original decisions  had
    been withdrawn, achieving the first remedy sought, the  visas  had  not
    yet physically been issued such that the second remedy sought  had  not
    been fully achieved  (albeit  once  the  decision  to  issue  had  been
    communicated the Applicants immediately sought to settle  proceedings).
    The third remedy sought was for indemnity costs because the  Respondent
    had failed to address the errors in the decisions  made  at  pre-action
    stage.   The  final  remedy  sought  was  for  an  interim  order   for
    disclosure, in the national interest, to bring  down  the  Respondent's
    hostile and discriminatory algorithm.  The Applicants preceded the JCWI
    in that regard  and  were  the  first  parties  to  pursue  and  obtain
    permission to challenge the algorithm.  Mr Rosemarine confirmed that no
    interim order for disclosure had been made and stated that it was still
    important because the algorithm breached  the  Equality  Act  2010  for
    which the Applicants were entitled to damages and the  documents  about
    it to pursue such a claim.


76. Mr Rosemarie submitted that this application for  Judicial  Review  was
    not academic  in  early  July  2020  when  the  Respondent  offered  to
    reconsider the decisions under challenge because only a long period  to
    reconsider the decisions in the future was  offered  which  "was  worse
    than worthless to the Applicants and would have  been  idiocy,  madness
    and crazy to agree to".  The Respondent's offer was said to be  cynical
    and was a gross abuse of the Respondent's powers, as well as  abuse  by
    her legal advisers in contacting the litigants  in  person  about  this
    behind Counsel's back.  Mr Rosemarine suggested  that  if  the  consent
    order had been agreed in July, the Applicants would have to immediately
    begin a fresh application for Judicial Review on the  basis  of  delay,
    that the Respondent had not issued the visas that the  Applicants  were
    entitled to in the twelve months since the applications were made.


77. It was further submitted that if the consent order had been  agreed  in
    July, there was no reasonable expectation that  the  visas  would  have
    been granted, even though they have since been  granted.   The  reasons
    given for the Applicants to suspect a further  refusal  were  that  the
    algorithm challenged was discriminatory, it  was  still  in  place  and
    systemic discrimination by the Respondent's staff still  existed,  with
    institutional bias and discrimination  against  Syrians;  all  of  this
    being in the context of the Respondent accepting that she was operating
    a hostile immigration environment.  In addition, Mr Rosemarine referred
    to the decisions under challenge which stated that future  applications
    would be refused but could not explain  the  relevance  of  that  to  a
    reconsideration of the outstanding applications  once  those  decisions
    had been withdrawn (which they had been by the time of the hearing).


78. Mr Rosemarine also submitted that the visas were granted because of the
    pressure of the ongoing application for Judicial  Review  but  with  no
    reasons given for  the  assertion,  only  repeated  references  to  the
    Respondent being unreasonable in seeking further evidence before a  new
    decision was made and in seeking any costs in this case.  The relevance
    of these points were said to be that it would have been unreasonable to
    sign the proposed  consent  order  in  circumstances  where  a  further
    immediate application for permission to apply for Judicial Review would
    have been necessary against the request for  further  evidence  of  the
    failure to give a lawful reason for refusal  (albeit  the  applications
    had not at that stage been refused on reconsideration,  nor  were  they
    ultimately refused when the decisions were taken).


79. I asked Mr Rosemarine on what basis the Upper Tribunal could  or  would
    have granted a mandatory order for the  issue  of  entry  clearance  to
    these Applicants, as originally sought.  He stated that  this  is  High
    Court litigation and the application will definitely be  sent  back  to
    the High Court, suggesting this may be on appeal but the Applicants are
    seeking to settle matters before that.  The question was  repeated,  to
    which Mr Rosemarine repeated his earlier submissions on his view of the
    absurdity of  the  Applicants  agreeing  to  the  draft  consent  order
    proposed in early July 2020.  On the  third  attempt  to  identify  the
    basis upon which the Applicants claim that a mandatory order would have
    been granted in this application for the issue of  entry  clearance  if
    the  substantive  application  for  Judicial   Review   proceeded,   Mr
    Rosemarine asserted that 'we' have proved that  the  refusals  were  in
    breach of Human Rights and the Upper  Tribunal  is  bound  by  the  EEA
    Regulations  and  the  Equality  Act  as  well  as  the  provision   of
    entitlement to a practical remedy, where there is a right, there  is  a
    remedy.


80. I sought confirmation from Mr Rosemarine that the most  recent  written
    submissions on costs contained the entirety of  the  Applicants'  claim
    for costs, which was for the Respondent to pay their  reasonable  costs
    of this application.  Mr Rosemarine stated that the  Applicants  sought
    their reasonable costs, including indemnity  costs  on  an  appropriate
    basis but that they have not sought all the indemnity  costs  they  are
    entitled to.  Upon a further request for clarification,  Mr  Rosemarine
    stated that it is only reasonable costs now being sought with  the  aim
    of obtaining a costs award  in  the  Applicants'  favour,  although  he
    continued to maintain that they were entitled to indemnity costs.


81. As to the question of whether the Applicants' conduct  in  refusing  to
    agree  the  consent  order  in  early  July  2020  was  reasonable,  Mr
    Rosemarine reiterated the practical difficulties, time and money  spent
    by the Applicants making their applications for entry  clearance;  that
    they were denied a visit to their family  in  16  years  and  11  years
    respectively for each Applicant and were exasperated that they had  not
    been granted entry clearance and that the Respondent  was  proposing  a
    long period of time before acknowledging that  they  were  entitled  to
    visas.


82. Mr Rosemarine submitted that all of the work done could be  undone  now
    by a very late application by the Respondent to  seek  �6000  in  costs
    contrary to their previous offer  to  pay  the  Applicants'  reasonable
    costs.  I reminded Mr Rosemarine that although the amount  claimed  had
    only recently been available, the possible adverse  costs  consequences
    of pursing the application had clearly been set out by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Rintoul and Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek.  The response to this
    was that Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul did not disclose his knowledge of
    his colleague Judge representing the Respondent which  evolved  into  a
    submission that the grant of permission by Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul
    was tainted by apparent bias and therefore was of no  consequence.   Mr
    Rosemarine then stated it would not be  of  no  consequence  but  there
    would be complex and serious legal  consequences  (without  identifying
    any)  and  confirmed,  when  invited  to  clarify,  that  despite   the
    submission, he did not intend or want to undermine the decision in  the
    Applicants' favour to grant permission to apply  for  Judicial  Review.
    Mr Rosemarine was unable to explain the relevance of these  submissions
    to the issue of costs and reasonableness or otherwise of the conduct of
    the parties when failing to reach agreement to settle this application.


83. Mr Rosemarine continued to rely on his  written  submissions  that  the
    Applicants had a legitimate expectation to payment of their  reasonable
    costs, even though they did not sign  the  consent  order  making  that
    offer in July 2020.


84. In relation to the reasonableness of the consent order proposed by  the
    Respondent, Mr Rosemarine sought to rely on  the  case  of  R  (MMK)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  (consent  orders  -  legal
    effect - enforcement) [2017] UKUT 198 (IAC) in which the Respondent had
    not, in accordance with the terms of a  consent  order,  made  a  fresh
    decision and the applicant in that case was required to issue  a  fresh
    application for Judicial Review.  The case was primarily relied upon as
    a basis for the Applicants' mistrust of the Respondent to do as offered
    in the consent order proposed.


85. Mr Rosemarine stated repeatedly in submissions that the Applicants were
    entitled to await the grant of their visas before agreeing  that  these
    proceedings  should  be  disposed  of  by  consent  and  that  once  an
    indication that this would happen had been given in the week before the
    hearing (albeit the visas themselves had not physically  been  obtained
    as at the date of hearing) they made all efforts and reasonable  offers
    to reach agreement which were  refused.   I  specifically  referred  Mr
    Rosemarine to the two consent orders that were proposed and  asked  why
    either was reasonable for the Respondent to agree to.  No clear  answer
    was given to that question, in fact no reference was made at all to the
    terms of either consent order proposed by the Applicants at the end  of
    September 2020.  Instead, Mr  Rosemarine  persisted  in  repetition  of
    other matters and in particular that the Respondent was not entitled to
    request further information before taking a fresh  decision,  it  being
    unreasonable and unfair, with reference to there  being  authority  for
    that, albeit none was identified.


86. As to the principles for an award of costs,  Mr  Rosemarine  relied  on
    Boxall [2001] 4 CCLR 258 at paragraph 22 and proceeded to list  a  line
    of cases in which it had since been approved.  It was submitted that in
    accordance with these principles,  the  Applicants  have  succeeded  in
    their application and are therefore entitled to their costs.


87. At the end of his submissions,  Mr  Rosemarine  accused  Ms  Thelen  of
    submitting a skeleton argument which was full of mistakes; referred  to
    the application for  Judicial  Review  being  filed  on  time;  to  the
    Acknowledgment of Service being filed late such that the Respondent was
    not entitled to participate in proceedings and asserted that there were
    mistakes in the decision granting permission of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Rintoul.  These matters were not elaborated on and were  in  any  event
    irrelevant to the only remaining issue of costs.


Submissions on behalf of the Respondent


88. Ms Thelen began by confirming  that  her  skeleton  argument  had  been
    settled  on  instructions  and  with  express   approval   from   those
    instructing her, with familiarity of the application and there were  no
    known errors.


89. Ms Thelen submitted the  following  five  points  in  relation  to  the
    application for Judicial Review being academic from  early  July  2020.
    First, that the standard position is that where a decision maker agrees
    to reconsider a decision, in the ordinary course  any  application  for
    Judicial Review  would  become  academic  because  realistically,  that
    reflects the entirety of substantive relief that could in any event  be
    ordered by  the  Tribunal.   Secondly,  there  is  nothing  about  this
    particular application for Judicial Review that would take  this  claim
    out of the ordinary or indicate  that  the  Tribunal  would  order  the
    Respondent to grant the applications for entry clearance.  This is  not
    a case which permits only one outcome to the  application  requiring  a
    mandatory order, particularly where the application  had  only  reached
    the permission stage.  The Applicants have not pointed to any authority
    in support of such a suggestion.  Thirdly, the grant of  permission  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul demonstrates  arguability  of  traditional
    errors in discretionary decision making and it is unlikely on the facts
    of this case, in particular that if a breach of Article  8  was  found,
    that such  matters  could  only  be  determined  one  way  to  make  it
    appropriate for a mandatory order.  The grant of permission also raised
    a new point not in the grounds of challenge which provides  no  support
    for a mandatory  order.   The  fact  that  the  Respondent  offered  to
    withdraw the decisions and reconsider them a week after  the  grant  of
    permission  does  not  demonstrate  bad  faith  but   rather   entirely
    reasonable and prompt decision-making to resolve the claim.   Fourthly,
    there is no basis upon which the Applicants could  reasonably  need  to
    hold out in order to obtain a visa and any  consent  order  could  have
    made provision for review after a specific period if a  fresh  decision
    had not been taken as indicated  and  this  would  have  avoided  three
    months of unnecessary correspondence incurring  costs  on  both  sides.
    Finally, the subject matter of correspondence since early July 2020 has
    not been about the substance of the application for Judicial Review but
    predominantly about costs.


90. On 1 July 2020, the Respondent's draft consent order included an  offer
    to pay the Applicants' reasonable costs of this application as  in  the
    ordinary course, they would be entitled to that.  As a starting  point,
    that offer was rejected and the Applicants are not entitled to  recover
    any of their costs after that reasonable offer was made.   However,  on
    the facts of this  case,  Ms  Thelen  submitted  that  the  Applicants'
    conduct has been so unreasonable and has resulted in  such  significant
    costs to the Respondent, that she should be entitled to her costs  from
    the point of her reasonable offer to settle and  that  the  appropriate
    order prior to that date is no order as to costs.  The reasons for this
    are set out in Counsel's skeleton argument and continue  to  be  relied
    upon.


91. As a general point, Ms Thelen highlighted the multiple applications and
    items of correspondence from and on behalf of the Applicants  from  the
    beginning  of  July,  which  she  described  as  a  confused  pool   of
    documentation for the Respondent to deal with.  The documents  included
    two  applications  for  wasted  and/or   indemnity   costs   (with   no
    differentiation  between  the  two),   an   application   to   continue
    proceedings but also an application for a stay and  an  application  to
    adduce witness evidence;  as  well  as  correspondence  about  possible
    settlement and costs.  There were a  significant  number  of  different
    matters for the Respondent to consider and respond to, including a list
    of very serious allegations made  against  the  Respondent  and/or  her
    legal representatives.


92. The Respondent was faced with a claim which was  difficult  to  follow,
    difficult to read, consisted of  multiple  applications,  multiple  and
    inconsistent requests for indemnity and wasted costs without any  legal
    foundation or analysis of the basis for such a claim and  no  authority
    for the propositions made.


93. Ms Thelen submitted that this is and should have been a straightforward
    case, one in which  permission  was  refused  on  the  papers,  granted
    permission at an oral renewal  hearing  and  with  a  prompt  offer  to
    reconsider.  What followed was not straightforward or necessary and the
    Applicants were warned repeatedly by  the  Upper  Tribunal  that  their
    behaviour was unreasonable and that they were at risk of having to  pay
    the Respondent's costs if they persisted.  Counsel for  the  Applicants
    had also entirely ignored the Tribunal's express reminder of  his  duty
    to assist the Tribunal  by  presenting  documents  in  a  coherent  and
    legible form, which is a matter of efficiency for all.


94. In relation to the Respondent's request for updated  information,  this
    was a brief request to update on the Applicants' current  circumstances
    which far from being abusive and manipulative as claimed, was  no  more
    than good practice before a new decision was issued to ensure  that  it
    was based on up to date information.


95. In response to the allegation of costs  being  threatened  against  the
    Applicants as a reason to withhold issue of a  visa,  it  is  simply  a
    matter of the Immigration Rules that litigation debts  are  taken  into
    account but not relevant to the present applications as the  Respondent
    has already confirmed that they have been granted.  If a costs order is
    made and remains outstanding, that could only be  potentially  relevant
    to any future applications.


Post-script to the hearing


96. Following the conclusion of the substantive  hearing,  there  has  been
    repeated  correspondence  from  the  Applicants  and/or  their  Counsel
    seeking,  inter  alia,  to  make  further  submissions  (for  which  no
    application has been made and  no  permission  granted);  make  further
    complaints against the Respondent and/or her legal representatives  and
    make further complaints against the Upper Tribunal.  In response to one
    of those communications, the Respondent  has  confirmed  the  issue  of
    visas to the Applicants.  The other matters have not been pursued  with
    any formal application to the Upper Tribunal and will not therefore  be
    considered further.




Discussion

97. This application for Judicial Review is, and always should have been  a
    straightforward one, as should have been the ancillary matter of costs.
     As set out repeatedly by three Judges of the Upper Tribunal  prior  to
    the hearing (including myself), an oral hearing to deal solely with the
    issue of costs was wholly unnecessary and inappropriate.  The issue  of
    costs should always be dealt with proportionately by reference  to  the
    substantive case and should not as a matter  of  practice  occupy  more
    time and resources of both  the  Tribunal  and  the  parties  than  the
    matters of substance in issue in the claim.  This is not what  happened
    in  this  application,  which  should  never   have   resulted   in   a
    disproportionate use of almost  a  full  day's  hearing  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal solely on the issue of costs and would not have done, but  for
    the wholly unreasonable conduct of the Applicants who  have  failed  to
    undertake any objective or rational assessment of the merits  of  their
    claim and more particularly, of the resolution of any  application  for
    costs which could and should have proportionately been done by a  Judge
    on the papers pursuant to  written  submissions  if  the  parties  were
    unable to agree on costs in  principle.   Whilst  I  accept  that  this
    application has been pursued by litigants acting  in  person,  with  an
    Interested Party conducting the litigation on their behalf pursuant  to
    a Power of Attorney, they have at all times been assisted  and  advised
    by Mr Rosemarine of Counsel on a direct access  basis.   Unfortunately,
    Mr Rosemarine has demonstrated repeatedly in the content  and  tone  of
    his submissions the same failure to undertake an objective or  rational
    assessment of the claim, or the means by which it  would  appropriately
    and proportionately be resolved.


98. The applications for costs to resolve between the parties, are  as  set
    out above, (i) the Applicants' application for their  reasonable  costs
    of this application for Judicial Review, which the Respondent  resists;
    and (ii) the Respondent's application for her costs from 1  July  2020,
    which the Applicant resists.  As expressly confirmed by  Mr  Rosemarine
    during the hearing, the Applicants no longer pursue any application for
    indemnity or wasted costs against the Respondent (despite a  continuing
    claim to entitlement to the same) which is appropriate considering that
    the same application(s) have already been refused by the Upper Tribunal
    with no new matters being raised in relation to  this;  the  Applicants
    have not set out the relevant authority or test for such an application
    or order and what has been set out in the course of  these  proceedings
    would not in any event support an award of costs against the Respondent
    on an indemnity basis or a wasted costs order.  The two primary reasons
    given for the applications made, that the Respondent failed to  resolve
    the issues at pre-action stage and that the Respondent failed to  issue
    EEA Family Permits (which have never been applied for and which  formed
    no part of these proceedings as pleaded), form no appropriate basis for
    indemnity or wasted costs against the Respondent.


99. For the  avoidance  of  doubt  and  without  unnecessarily  going  into
    detailed reasons in response to each and every allegation of misconduct
    by the Respondent and/or her legal representatives,  I  pause  here  to
    make it clear that there is no evidence of any  unprofessional  conduct
    by either as claimed.  The very  serious  allegations  that  have  been
    repeatedly made against the Respondent and/or her legal representatives
    are wholly without foundation and serve only to demonstrate fundamental
    misunderstandings about the  nature  of  Judicial  Review  proceedings,
    professional conduct (particularly in relation to litigants in  person)
    and costs.


100. In relation to the Applicants'  application  for  costs,  the  test  in
    public law cases such as the present one is  set  out  in  M  v  London
    Borough of Croydon [2012] EWCA Civ 595, as  per  Master  of  the  Rolls
    (not, as submitted by Mr Rosemarine, Boxhall which  although  for  some
    time was the leading authority, has been superseded  for  many  years).
    Three categories of cases  are  set  out,  together  with  the  general
    principles for each, in paragraphs 60-65 as follows:

          1. Thus, in Administrative Court cases, just as  in  other  civil
             litigation, particularly where a claim has been settled, there
             is, in my view, a sharp difference between (i) a case where  a
             claimant  has  been  wholly  successful  whether  following  a
             contested hearing or pursuant to a settlement, and (ii) a case
             where he has only succeeded  in  part  following  a  contested
             hearing, or pursuant to a settlement, and (iii) a  case  where
             there has been some compromise which does not actually reflect
             the claimant's claims. While in every case, the allocation  of
             costs will depend on the specific facts, there are some points
             which can be made about these different types of case.


          1. In case (i), it is hard to see why  the  claimant  should  not
             recover all his costs, unless there is some good reason to the
             contrary. Whether pursuant to judgment following  a  contested
             hearing, or by virtue of a settlement, the  claimant  can,  at
             least absent special  circumstances,  say  that  he  has  been
             vindicated, and, as  the  successful  party,  that  he  should
             recover his costs. In the latter case, the defendants  can  no
             doubt say that they were realistic in settling, and should not
             be penalised in costs, but the answer to that  point  is  that
             the defendants should, on that basis, have settled before  the
             proceedings were issued: that is one of the main points of the
             pre-action   protocols.   Ultimately,   it   seems    to    me
             that Bahta was decided on this basis.


          1. In case (ii), when deciding  how  to  allocate  liability  for
             costs  after  a  trial,  the  court  will  normally  determine
             questions such as how reasonable the claimant was in  pursuing
             the unsuccessful claim, how important it was compared with the
             successful claim, and how much the costs were increased  as  a
             result of the claimant pursuing the unsuccessful claim.  Given
             that there will have been a hearing, the court will  be  in  a
             reasonably good position to make findings on  such  questions.
             However, where there has been a settlement, the court will, at
             least normally, be in a significantly worse position  to  make
             findings on such issues than where the case  has  been  fought
             out. In many such cases, the court will be able to form a view
             as to the appropriate costs order based  on  such  issues;  in
             other cases, it will be much more difficult.  I  would  accept
             the  argument  that,  where  the  parties  have  settled   the
             claimant's substantive claims on the basis that he succeeds in
             part, but only in part, there is often much  to  be  said  for
             concluding that there is no order for costs. That I think  was
             the approach adopted in Scott. However, where there is not  a
             clear winner, so much would depend on the particular facts. In
             some such cases, it may help to consider who would have won if
             the matter had proceeded to trial,  as,  if  it  is  tolerably
             clear,  it  may,  for  instance  support  or   undermine   the
             contention that one of the two claims was  stronger  than  the
             other. Boxall appears to have been such case.


          1. In case (iii), the court is  often  unable  to  gauge  whether
             there is a successful party in any respect, and, if so, who it
             is. In such cases, therefore, there is an even  more  powerful
             argument that the default position  should  be  no  order  for
             costs. However, in some such cases, it may well be sensible to
             look at the underlying  claims  and  inquire  whether  it  was
             tolerably clear who would have  won  if  the  matter  had  not
             settled. If it is, then that may  well  strongly  support  the
             contention that the party who would have won did better out of
             the settlement, and therefore did win.


          1. Having said that, I should add that I have read  what  Stanley
             Burnton LJ says in his judgment, and I agree with it.


          1. Having given such general guidance on costs issues in relation
             to Administrative Court cases which settle on all issues  save
             costs, it is  right  to  emphasise  that,  as  in  most  cases
             involving judicial guidance on costs, each case turns  on  its
             own facts. A particular case may have an unusual feature which
             would, or at least could, justify departing  from  what  would
             otherwise be the appropriate costs order.

101. I find that the present application for Judicial  Review  falls  within
    the first category, a case in which the Applicants have achieved  their
    primary remedy sought, namely the withdrawal  of  the  decisions  under
    challenge for fresh decisions to be taken by  the  Respondent.   Whilst
    further remedies were sought by the Applicants which were not  achieved
    directly as a result of these proceedings, nor would have  likely  been
    granted  following  successful   substantive   consideration   of   the
    application by the Upper Tribunal (such as the grant of entry clearance
    and the issue of visas, albeit the Applicants have ultimately  obtained
    this following the fresh decisions in their case on the basis of up  to
    date evidence available), this is not a case which on its  facts  falls
    in to the second category of cases where it  could  be  said  that  the
    Applicants have only succeeded in part.


102. As such, in the  normal  course  of  events  and  as  proposed  by  the
    Respondent  in  the  draft  consent  order  in  early  July  2020,  the
    Applicants would have been  awarded  their  reasonable  costs  of  this
    application for Judicial Review.  However, the Respondent submits  that
    given the Applicants' conduct in these  proceedings,  both  before  and
    after that proposed consent order, that the more appropriate  order  is
    no order as to costs.


103. Although there is significant force in the submissions made  on  behalf
    of  the  Respondent  in  relation  to  the  Applicants'  conduct  after
    settlement was proposed in early July 2020, there is far less force  in
    relation to the earlier period.  This  application for Judicial  Review
    was poorly pleaded, with the majority of  the  grounds  being  unclear,
    unparticularised, vague and unsupported; and it was  accompanied  by  a
    bundle which included a not insignificant number of  wholly  irrelevant
    documents (such as news articles critical of the Home Office but not on
    issues even remotely relevant to this application for  Judicial  Review
    or the Applicants' circumstances).


104.  However,  the  pursuance  of  the  application  was  not  unreasonable
    (particularly in light of the grant of permission showing that  grounds
    were arguable), it followed pre-action correspondence (albeit similarly
    unclear and unparticularised at least in part) and did not display such
    significantly  poor  or  unreasonable  conduct  that  would  amount  to
    sufficient reason to depart from the usual position that the Applicants
    should recover their reasonable costs of the application, at least  for
    the period up to the first offer of settlement by the Respondent.


105. In relation to the period after the first offer of settlement, for  the
    following reasons I find that the Applicants' conduct was so  poor  and
    unreasonable in refusing to  engage  meaningfully  in  the  process  of
    settlement  and  in   pursuing   these   proceedings,   with   multiple
    applications,  up  to  and  including  a  wholly  disproportionate  and
    unnecessary hearing to be such that not only are they not  entitled  to
    their reasonable costs after 1 July 2020; but that  the  Respondent  is
    entitled to her costs after that point.  These are matters on which the
    Applicants were repeatedly warned by the Upper Tribunal,  albeit  these
    were consistently ignored.


106. First, the proposed form of consent first  offered  by  the  Respondent
    was entirely reasonable and there was and remains no  good  reason  for
    its rejection by the Applicants, either in terms of substance or in the
    ancillary matter of costs.  The terms of the draft  consent  order  for
    the withdrawal and reconsideration of  the  decisions  under  challenge
    were reasonable, comprehensive and reflected what in  reality  was  the
    best that the Applicants could hope to achieve even if  they  succeeded
    following a substantive oral hearing of their claims.  As above, on the
    facts  and  given  the  nature  of  the  applications  and  grounds  of
    challenge, this was never a case  in  which  there  was  any  realistic
    prospect of the Upper Tribunal  granting  a  mandatory  order  for  the
    Applicants to be granted entry clearance and Mr Rosemarine  was  unable
    in  oral  submissions  to  identify  any  basis  on  which  this  would
    realistically have happened,  referring  either  to  wholly  irrelevant
    matters or simply repeatedly asserting that the  original  applications
    for entry clearance in August 2019 were sufficient for entry  clearance
    to be granted.  The most that the Applicants could have rationally  and
    objectively achieved in these proceedings was  for  the  withdrawal  or
    quashing of the decisions under challenge.   This  was  made  expressly
    clear in the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul  dated  6  August
    2020.


107. On behalf of the Applicants, Mr Rosemarine submitted that there were  a
    number of reasons as to why it was unreasonable for the  Applicants  to
    have agreed to the first proposed consent order, including, inter  alia
    the  long  period  within  which  reconsideration  was   offered;   the
    expectation of a further (unlawful) refusal of  the  applications;  the
    expectation that  the  Respondent  would  not  comply  with  the  terms
    offered; the immediate  need  for  further  identical  Judicial  Review
    proceedings and a failure to agree at least aspects of payment of costs
    (Counsel's hourly rate) in advance  of  any  schedule  of  costs  being
    provided.


108. In relation to the time for reconsideration, this was a point on  which
    the Respondent made a further offer of a shorter time period and  which
    did not feature significantly in the correspondence by or on behalf  of
    the Applicants.  Aside from one piece of correspondence  on  behalf  of
    the Applicants to the Upper Tribunal, the Applicants did not  expressly
    dispute the length of time proposed for reconsideration of the decision
    (by reference to the  Respondent's  guidance  for  standard  processing
    times or otherwise) nor was any  alternative  period  proposed  to  the
    Respondent by way of correspondence or in  a  consent  order.   At  its
    highest, the Applicants made a number of proposals  for  consent  which
    included a mandatory order for the applications for visit visas  to  be
    granted, in  one  case  in  as  little  as  within  four  days  of  the
    correspondence.  For the reasons already given, this was not a case  in
    which a mandatory order was ever going to realistically be made.


109. In all of the circumstances, including the difficulties  of  continuing
    normal business caused by Covid-19 during the summer of 2020, the  time
    period offered for reconsideration was not unreasonable  and  certainly
    no slower than the Applicants were likely to achieve as an outcome,  by
    pursuing this application for Judicial Review to a substantive hearing.
     In fact, the Respondent did in any event reconsider  the  applications
    and granted them prior to the substantive hearing,  such  that  if  the
    substantive hearing had been pursued for a mandatory order,  the  issue
    of a visa would have taken longer than it did and  likely  longer  than
    that which had been proposed on 1 July 2020 by the Respondent.


110. In relation to the Applicants'  expectation  of  a  further  (unlawful)
    refusal, there was no rational or objective basis for any such concern.
     Mr Rosemarine sought to rely on  the  cover  letter  accompanying  the
    refusal decision which stated "Any future UK visa applications you make
    will be considered on their individual merits, however you  are  likely
    to be refused unless the circumstances of  your  application  change.".
    However,  those  decisions  had  been  withdrawn  and  were  no  longer
    therefore of any effect, instead, what was offered (and what  occurred)
    was a fresh consideration of the applications made with the benefit  of
    up to date evidence upon which there was no indication  of  any  future
    refusal which could bite.  Further, the Respondent confirmed  that  the
    algorithm challenged was no longer in use (as already set  out  in  the
    decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul dated  6  August  2020),  such
    that the Applicants could not reasonably be concerned  that  any  fresh
    decision would be tainted by the claimed illegality and  discrimination
    on that basis.  In any event, as has been shown by  subsequent  events,
    the concerns were  wholly  unfounded  as  the  applications  have  been
    granted, there has been no further refusal of the applications  and  no
    arguable unlawfulness in the fresh decisions.


111. In relation to the expectation that the  Respondent  would  not  comply
    with the terms of her  proposed  consent  order,  there  was  again  no
    rational or objective basis for the same and in any event,  there  were
    options available to the Applicants to  deal  with  any  such  matters,
    either in proposing alternative terms in the consent order  (which  was
    not pursued), or if need be, further proceedings to enforce  the  terms
    if and when breached.  Mr Rosemarine's reliance on MMK as an example of
    where the Respondent had not complied with the  terms  of  an  approved
    consent order does not provide  any  basis  for  refusing  to  agree  a
    reasonable proposal to resolve these proceedings and  shows  only  that
    there would be a further remedy available in the event of  any  breach.
    In any event, again as shown by subsequent  events,  even  without  the
    Applicants agreeing to the draft  consent  order,  the  decisions  were
    withdrawn and reconsidered  (with  a  positive  outcome)  within  three
    months by the Respondent.


112. Mr Rosemarine's submission that the Applicants would  have  immediately
    had grounds to issue an identical Judicial Review application following
    agreement of the proposed consent order was wholly without  foundation.
    At its highest, any further application could only  have  been  on  the
    basis of delay and not on the same grounds as the  present  application
    because there would no longer be any substantive decision to challenge,
    and even if the applications had been refused when  considered  afresh,
    the Applicants could not have reasonably assumed that any refusal would
    contain the same or even any arguable errors.  Any  delay  claim  would
    not have been immediate given the proposed  time  for  reconsideration.
    There is no identifiable or rational basis upon  which  the  Applicants
    could have reasonably refused the Respondent's proposed  consent  order
    on the basis that an immediate or identical  application  for  Judicial
    Review would have been necessary or appropriate.


113. The final issue raised and the one which featured most  prominently  in
    correspondence between the parties was as to the Applicant's  Counsel's
    fees and in particular,  the  request  that  the  Respondent  agree  in
    advance of any schedule of costs, an hourly rate of �500 for him.   The
    precise claim for costs or part thereof, as  opposed  to  an  award  of
    reasonable costs is not an appropriate reason to  refuse  a  reasonable
    proposal of consent (which included provision for payment of reasonable
    costs, to be assessed if not agreed) and even less so in  circumstances
    where this correspondence was isolated from  any  indication  of  total
    costs or hours worked and came directly from Counsel.  This  point  was
    also clearly made to the Applicants in the decision of  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Rintoul dated 6 August 2020.  As in the usual course of  Judicial
    Review proceedings, agreement as to substance and costs in principle is
    wholly appropriate, with the assessment of the amount of  costs  to  be
    determined afterwards.


114. Secondly, the Applicants' repeated applications to the  Upper  Tribunal
    and failure to comply with directions was unnecessary and  unreasonable
    for the reasons identified in the decisions of  Upper  Tribunal  Judges
    Rintoul and Kopieczek set out already  above.   The  applications  were
    unclear, unparticularised, unsubstantiated and repetitive; contrary  to
    the overriding objective and failed to comply with  basic  professional
    standards  expected  of  a  reasonably  competent  barrister  for   the
    presentation of court documents (despite the  repeated  reminders  from
    the Upper Tribunal on this point) in the context of an application  for
    Judicial Review which was, by early July 2020, academic.  The assertion
    that the claim was not academic unless and  until  the  Applicants  had
    achieved all of the remedies sought, particularly the  grant  of  entry
    clearance, was misconceived for the reasons already  given  above  that
    there was no realistic basis for any such mandatory order being made by
    the Upper Tribunal even if the  Applicants  were  successful  on  every
    ground at the substantive stage.


115. Thirdly, the draft consent orders proposed by the Applicants  were  all
    inappropriate and unreasonable at least in some respects.  For example,
    some contained entirely contradictory costs provisions;  the  tone  and
    language used was inflammatory  and  inappropriate;  the  inclusion  of
    provisions about who the Respondent may instruct in any application for
    Judicial Review was wholly outwith the grounds of this application  for
    Judicial Review and the inclusion of  provision  for  a  one  day  oral
    hearing on costs, prior to any costs schedule even  being  prepared  by
    the Applicants, was premature in the extreme.  The Upper Tribunal would
    not have approved any of the proposed consent orders by the Applicants,
    even  if  the  Respondent  had  agreed  to  them  given  the  poor  and
    inappropriate drafting contained in each of  them.   There  was  not  a
    single rational or reasonable offer of settlement  by  the  Applicants;
    nor was there  any  rational  or  reasonable  correspondence  with  the
    Respondent on any matters  relevant  to  the  substance  of  the  claim
    (separate to the matter of costs) as to the terms of the consent orders
    proposed by her.


116. Fourthly, in written submissions and maintained orally,  Mr  Rosemarine
    claimed that both he personally and the  Applicants  had  a  legitimate
    expectation of the Respondent paying the Applicants'  reasonable  costs
    of this application for Judicial Review and  that  the  Respondent  had
    unreasonably reneged on that offer from the draft consent order in July
    2020.  It was also asserted that it was appropriate to then  sign  that
    draft  consent  order,  despite   the   fact   that   proceedings   and
    circumstances had since moved on, in late September 2020.  This shows a
    fundamental misunderstanding not only of the  principle  of  legitimate
    expectation but also of the basic  position  that  an  offer  which  is
    rejected is not, some significant time later, still  available  to  the
    Applicants nor does an offer which is rejected  in  any  way  bind  the
    Respondent.  The Respondent was not reneging on the offer, it had  been
    rejected and she was,  in  light  of  the  conduct  of  the  Applicants
    following that rejection, entitled to propose a  different  outcome  on
    costs.


117. Finally, whatever the dispute between  the  parties  on  the  issue  of
    costs in principle, no reason at all has been  put  forward  by  or  on
    behalf of the Applicants as to why they refused to agree to  the  Upper
    Tribunal determining the issue of costs on the papers on the  basis  of
    written submissions such as  to  avoid  an  oral  hearing,  which  they
    expressly accept was unnecessary and  wholly  inappropriate  and  which
    wasted the time and resources of the Upper Tribunal and only served  to
    further increase the costs incurred by both parties.


118. For these reasons, I wholly reject Mr Rosemarine's assertion  that  the
    Applicants have done all that they could to  settle  these  proceedings
    and avoid the need for an oral hearing.  To  the  contrary,  they  have
    done all  they  could  to  continue  them  leading  to  the  Respondent
    incurring costs and significant resources of the Upper  Tribunal  being
    wasted.


119.  In  essence,  although   there   have   been   numerous   unsuccessful
    applications, voluminous correspondence and almost an entire day's oral
    hearing in the Upper Tribunal,  the  assessment  of  this  claim  being
    academic and as to the likely costs consequences of pursing  the  claim
    remains as it was before Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul on 6 August  2020
    and reiterated by Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek  on  18  August  2020.
    The Applicants failed to have regard to those decisions or the warnings
    contained within them as to the  likely  costs  consequences  and  have
    continued  pursuing  this  application  for  Judicial  Review  with  an
    unreasonable  focus  on  indemnity  costs  and  wasted  costs   (albeit
    ultimately not pursued at the oral hearing and in  any  event,  without
    any arguable foundation for either claim) without having rationally  or
    objectively considered the merits of the claim, the  reasonableness  of
    pursing it, or their conduct.  In these circumstances,  the  Respondent
    is awarded her costs from 1 July 2020, the only remaining issue  is  as
    to whether it is appropriate for the Applicants to pay these  costs  or
    for Mr Rosemarine to be liable for them  pursuant  to  a  wasted  costs
    order.


120. At the end of the hearing, I raised with Mr Rosemarine the  possibility
    of a wasted costs  order  on  the  basis  of  his  conduct  as  Counsel
    throughout the course  of  proceedings,  including  the  oral  hearing,
    making it clear that he would have the opportunity to address  this  by
    written representations before any decision on wasted costs  was  made,
    in accordance with rule 10(7) of the Tribunal Procured (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.  At the end of the substantive hearing, nearing the end  of
    the usual court day and without any opportunity to reflect  on  events,
    it was  not  appropriate  or  fair  to  have  asked  Mr  Rosemarine  to
    immediately make oral submissions on such matters and as stated at  the
    hearing, he should have  an  opportunity  to  make  representations  in
    writing with time for  reflection  and  consideration  of  the  matters
    raised.


121. In the course of  representations  on  behalf  of  Mr  Rosemarine  made
    following the hearing (see further below), Ms Naik  QC  submitted  that
    the part of the draft judgment circulated to the parties on 18  January
    2021 immediately above and the approved transcript of the hearing which
    followed later were both factually incorrect; submitting  that  at  the
    hearing I stated that I "will" make a wasted  costs  order  against  Mr
    Rosemarine and had therefore already made  up  my  mind  on  the  issue
    without any meaningful process for  representations  or  consideration.
    My own notes of the hearing, the  approved  transcript  and  the  audio
    recording do not support the submission made and as above, the  written
    representations have been maintained despite neither Mr Rosemarine  nor
    those acting for him taking the opportunity they requested to listen to
    the audio recording.


122. There was no statement that a wasted costs order will be made,  to  the
    contrary, it was expressly stated that I would make no decision on  the
    matter without Mr Rosemarine first having had an  opportunity  to  make
    written representations  against  that;  with  a  written  decision  to
    follow.  There was no unfairness in  the  hearing  or  draft  judgment;
    which followed the usual process in accordance with rule 10(7)  of  the
    Tribunal   Procedure   (Upper   Tribunal)   Rules   2008,   with    the
    representations which followed being fully considered before a decision
    was reached.


123. The hand down of this decision has been considerably delayed  following
    the substantive hearing to allow for the process of representations  to
    be made in response to the notice given to  Mr  Rosemarine  before  the
    decision on wasted costs could be made; much of which it  is  necessary
    to record within the  decision  so  that  the  delay  as  well  as  the
    representations made are  understood  in  context.   The  fact  of  the
    considerable delay in  finalising  this  decision  to  allow  for  this
    process undermines Ms Naik QC's submission  that  the  issue  was  pre-
    determined without any meaningful consideration of the  representations
    made.


124. The draft embargoed judgment was initially circulated  to  the  parties
    on 18 January 2021, which included at the end a notice to  show  cause.
    Further to a request  for  additional  time  for  response  on  medical
    grounds, an amended draft of this judgment and separate notice to  show
    cause was sent to the parties on 25 January 2021.


125. The notice to show cause issued on 25 January 2021 gave  Mr  Rosemarine
    the opportunity in accordance with rule 10(7) of the Tribunal Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, to make representations against the making
    of a wasted costs order; and to make  any  representations  as  to  the
    appropriateness of referring his  conduct  in  this  case  to  the  Bar
    Standards Board; both by 4pm on 5 March 2021.   Further directions were
    given on 10 March 2021 and 6 April 2021 to extend the deadline for  any
    response to 4pm on 4 May 2021 due to Mr  Rosemarine's  continuing  ill-
    health.


126. By 4 March 2021, Mr Rosemarine was legally represented in  relation  to
    the matters addressed to him personally and on 17  March  2021,  Womble
    Bond Dickinson (UK)  LLP  ("WBD")  filed  a  formal  notice  of  acting
    confirming the matters upon which they are instructed on behalf  of  Mr
    Rosemarine.


127. On 13 April 2021, WBD made an  application  for  a  transcript  of  the
    hearing  on  2  October  2020,  which  was  subsequently  prepared  and
    approved, being sent to WBD on 7 May 2021.


128. It was apparent that although the  application  for  a  transcript  had
    been made on an urgent basis, it was not available to Mr Rosemarine  or
    those acting on his  behalf  before  the  deadline  for  submission  of
    written representations, which were received on  4  May  2021  together
    with supporting documents (and further to which a composite  bundle  of
    additional documents, including ones referred to by the Respondent, was
    submitted on 5 May 2021).  I considered that the transcript may  assist
    in  clarification  of   certain   matters   raised   in   the   written
    representations and be relevant to the same, such that directions dated
    10 May 2021 were issued to permit the  written  representations  to  be
    amended within 14 days in light of the transcript.


129. On 18 May 2021, on behalf of Mr Rosemarine, WBD requested  (i)  a  list
    of any changes suggested by myself to be made to the  transcript  prior
    to approval, and (ii) the original recording.  The correspondence  also
    sought a further extension of time to take into account the same, which
    was granted to 1 June 2021, albeit  the  documents  and/or  information
    requested was not provided given that no reasons  were  given  for  the
    request and Mr Rosemarine and those representing him had  the  approved
    transcript which should of itself have been sufficient for confirmation
    of the contents of the hearing.


130. In further correspondence on 28 May 2021, WBD repeated the request  for
    (i) a list of any changes suggested to the transcript prior to approval
    and (ii) the original recording; on the basis Mr Rosemarine  and  Mager
    Jarmakani had noted differences between  the  approved  transcript  and
    their recollection of the hearing.  Those requests were repeated  again
    on 28  May  2021  with  additional  reasons,  including  the  need  for
    transparency as to the origins of the content of the transcript in  the
    interests of fairness and ensuring parties are  on  an  equal  footing.
    WBD were informed that no list of changes to the  transcript  would  be
    provided but that arrangements were being made for access to the  audio
    recording so that the accuracy  of  the  transcript  could  be  checked
    against it.


131.  On  1  June  2021,  amended  written  representations  together   with
    accompanying documents were submitted on behalf of Mr Rosemarine.


132. On 6 July 2021, in response to  the  request  for  the  original  audio
    recording of the hearing, I gave the following directions:


      1) The audio recording of the hearing before UTJ Jackson on 2  October
         2020 will be available to the persons listed and on the  conditions
         set out below; to listen to in a court in Field House, in  private,
         on a date to be listed with reference to the availability of  those
         attending.


      2) The persons who may attend for this purpose are Mr  Rosemarine,  Ms
         Sonali Naik QC (Counsel for Mr Rosemarine), Mr James  Robins  &  Ms
         Helen Creech of Womble Bond Dickinson LLP (solicitor instructed  on
         behalf  of  Mr  Rosemarine)  and  any  short-hand  writer  that  Mr
         Rosemarine or his legal team wish to accompany them.  The  name  of
         any short-hand writer to attend to be provided no less  than  three
         working days beforehand.


      3) The listing will be for a single  court  day,  within  usual  court
         hours and with a  court  clerk  in  attendance  to  facilitate  the
         playback.  For information, the recording is a little under 3 hours
         and 15 minutes in total.  Within the court  time  available,  there
         may be an opportunity to replay parts of the recording if required.




      4) Those attending court to listen to the audio  of  the  hearing  may
         take notes whilst listening to the same but are  not  permitted  to
         make any other recording of the audio; nor will any copy of  it  be
         provided.


      5) Mr Rosemarine (or those instructed on his  behalf)  may  amend  the
         submissions made in response to the  Notice  to  Show  Cause  order
         within 14 days of the date on which  the  audio  recording  of  the
         hearing on 2 October 2020 is heard.


133. Mr Rosemarine wrote to the Upper Tribunal  directly  on  16  July  2021
    (letter dated 15 July 2021) to request a  copy  of  the  video  of  the
    substantive hearing to be sent to him electronically; my changes to the
    transcriber's original transcript; or in the alternative, for the video
    to be made  available  in  Manchester  UTIAC  (on  the  basis  that  Mr
    Rosemarine was unable to safely  or  economically  travel  to  London).
    This correspondence was said to be sent  directly  from  Mr  Rosemarine
    rather than WBD on the basis  that:  "Again  to  keep  costs  down,  my
    lawyers have suggested I myself reply  to  your  directions,  and  that
    "this is an aspect that [I] deal with [my]self  and  that  WBD  is  not
    instructed to do so."  The latter is contrary to the basis  upon  which
    WBD put themselves on record with the Upper  Tribunal,  which  did  not
    expressly contain any limitation on the basis of their instructions[2].


134. On 2 August 2021, a response  to  Mr  Rosemarine's  correspondence  was
    sent to WBD (as those  on  record  as  representing  Mr  Rosemarine  in
    relation to the notice to show cause) confirming that (i) there  is  no
    video recording of the hearing on 2  October  2020  (it  was  an  audio
    recording only); (ii) a decision has already been given to the  request
    for any changes made to  the  transcript  before  approval;  (iii)  the
    directions of 6 July 2021 stand on the basis that any person can attend
    to check the accuracy of the  approved  transcript  against  the  audio
    recording with available facilities  to  do  so  in  Field  House;  and
    finally a request was made for confirmation of who wished to attend  to
    listen to the audio and if no such attendance  was  requested,  whether
    the written representations submitted to date stand.  There was and has
    never been any need for Mr Rosemarine personally to listen to the audio
    in circumstances where what was requested was an opportunity  to  check
    the factual accuracy of the transcript.   That  does  not  require  any
    prior personal involvement or attendance at the hearing  on  2  October
    2020.


135. Further correspondence was received directly from Mr  Rosemarine  on  3
    August 2021, repeating the request and statement that  he  is  replying
    personally on the suggestion of WBD to keep costs down.


136. On 13 August 2021,  WBC  forwarded  Mr  Rosemarine's  response  to  the
    correspondence on 2 August 2021; to the effect that  he  had  contacted
    Manchester Piccadilly Hearing Centre directly who indicated  that  they
    had capacity and facilities for Mr Rosemarine to attend  to  listen  to
    the audio there and that Mr Rosemarine personally needed to  listen  to
    the audio because of discrepancies between what  he  heard  during  the
    hearing and the approved transcript; but he was  unable  to  travel  to
    London to do so.  The request was repeated for the audio  recording  to
    be released directly to Mr Rosemarine or for this to be made  available
    in the IAC in Manchester.  I pause to note that  Manchester  Piccadilly
    is a First-tier Tribunal hearing centre  and  not  part  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal, such that  even  if  such  direct  contact  contrary  to  the
    directions was appropriate, it was to the wrong body.


137. On 18 August 2021, the Upper Tribunal confirmed that the  directions  I
    gave on 6 July 2021 stand and confirmation was sought  of  any  persons
    who wished to attend to listen to the audio in  accordance  with  those
    directions.  If no such attendance was requested,  WBD  were  asked  to
    confirm whether the written submissions filed  to  date  stand  as  the
    final written representations.


138. On 23 August  2021,  separate  correspondence  was  received  from  WBD
    (forwarding Mr Rosemarine's personal response together  with  what  was
    said to be medical evidence) and from Mr Rosemarine  directly.   Whilst
    in response to the same communication  from  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the
    content of the two  separate  pieces  of  correspondence  differed  and
    neither referred to the other, nor were any reasons  provided  for  the
    multiple correspondence.


139. Confirmation was given again by the Upper Tribunal on  25  August  2021
    that the directions dated 6 July 2021 stand, with the request  repeated
    for confirmation of whether anyone will attend to listen to  the  audio
    and if not, whether the written representations to date stand.


140. On 31 August 2021, WBD informed the Upper Tribunal that  Mr  Rosemarine
    is undergoing medical tests (not specified or  evidenced  further)  and
    unable to attend Field House to listen to the audio recording, but that
    he reserved his position as to whether he wished to add to the  written
    representations made to date if he is able to listen to  the  audio  in
    due course.  It was stated that Mr Rosemarine wished  to  add  further,
    separate matters  to  his  written  representations  and  approval  for
    funding of this work was  required  from  his  insurers  such  that  an
    extension of time was sought to 1 October 2021 for further revision  of
    the submissions.


141. I declined that request on 8  September  2021  on  the  basis  that  Mr
    Rosemarine had been given an opportunity only to revise or confirm  the
    written  representations  submitted  on  his  behalf  once  the   audio
    recording had been listened to, to check the accuracy of  the  approved
    transcript, primarily to ascertain whether the allegations made  as  to
    the same were maintained.  This was not an open ended  opportunity  for
    additional matters to be added or any other revision given the  ongoing
    delay to this decision being handed down and the significant time  that
    had already been made available  for  a  response  to  the  show  cause
    notice.   Although  no  clear  answer  had  been  given  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal's repeated requests, it was inferred that despite the  request
    to do so, no person intended to listen to the audio in accordance  with
    the directions given on 6 July 2021 and therefore it  was  stated  that
    this  judgment,  including  the  decision  on  wasted  costs  would  be
    finalised for hand down on the basis  of  the  written  representations
    made to date.  It is noted that the extended correspondence  requesting
    to  hear  the  audio  pursuant  to  an  allegation  that  the  approved
    transcript was not accurate, which was not in the event undertaken, has
    unnecessarily and significantly further delayed the hand down  of  this
    judgment by some further four months.

Mr Rosemarine's submissions on wasted costs and conduct


142. In deciding whether it is appropriate to  make  a  wasted  costs  order
    against Mr Rosemarine, I have taken into account  the  revised  written
    submissions made on his behalf from Ms Sonali Naik QC dated 1 June 2021
    and the written statement from Mager  Jamarkani  (see  further  below);
    together with the history of these proceedings set out above.


143.  As  above,  stated  to  be  for  the   purpose   of   making   written
    representations, Mr Rosemarine, directly or through WBD acting  on  his
    behalf, made a number of repeated requests for further  information  or
    documents beyond the approved transcript.  Directions were given for Mr
    Rosemarine and/or those representing him to  listen  to  the  audio  to
    check the factual accuracy  of  the  approved  transcript  against  it;
    however, despite the requests and extended period of  time  over  which
    they were made, this opportunity has not been taken and  therefore  the
    written submissions made to date stand as those to be  considered.   It
    is in the interests of justice for this decision to  be  finalised  and
    handed down in light of the history of this  application  for  Judicial
    Review without further  delay  and  it  is  not  necessary  or  in  the
    interests of justice for any further extensions of time  to  be  given.
    Mr Rosemarine and those acting on his behalf  have  had  a  significant
    period of time in which to consider  all  necessary  matters  and  make
    representations in response  (even  taking  into  account  the  limited
    evidence of Mr Rosemarine's  ill-health  for  at  least  some  of  this
    period).

144. The written representations rehearse the history of  these  proceedings
    and make a number of  general points as to the quality  of  the  remote
    hearing (including a failure of the Tribunal to consider  of  it's  own
    motion an adjournment for this  reason,  a  point  already  dealt  with
    above); the fact that Mr Rosemarine is as yet unpaid  for  any  of  his
    work by the Applicants and that overall, the application  for  Judicial
    Review had not  become  academic  by  early  July  2020  following  the
    Respondent's proposed consent order.  This was  said  to  be  primarily
    because the period of time offered for reconsideration of the decisions
    under challenge was unreasonable, perverse,  contrary  to  policy  (for
    decisions to be made  within  three  weeks),  without  explanation  and
    possibly suggestive of the likely future outcome of  the  applications.
    In the context of Covid-19 presenting special circumstances, the offers
    made amounted to reconsideration within an indefinite period  of  time.
    Further, it is submitted that the timescale of the request for  further
    information and the grant of visas immediately before  the  substantive
    hearing was dictated by this application for Judicial Review.


145. In summary, Mr Rosemarine opposes the making of a  wasted  costs  order
    against him because (i) the Upper Tribunal cannot be satisfied that the
    high threshold for such an order has been crossed; (ii) the  Respondent
    failed properly or at all to engage with the Applicants with a view  to
    agreeing a form of consent to dispose of  the  application  between  23
    September and 2 October 2020; (iii) Mr Rosemarine has made  payment  in
    full of the Respondent's costs  such  that  discretion  should  not  be
    exercised to make a wasted costs order; and (iv) privilege has not been
    waived


146. The written representations set  out  the  wasted  costs  jurisdiction,
    limited  to  cases  where  the  standards  of   legal   representatives
    constitute an 'improper, unreasonable or  negligent  act  or  omission'
    pursuant to section 29(5) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act
    2007, as defined in Ridehalgh v Horsefield & Anor [1994] EWCA  Civ  40.
    It is submitted that there is no basis for  making  any  allegation  of
    improper conduct against Mr Rosemarine.  In relation to reasonableness,
    it is submitted:


         "AMR accepts that he has a unique and possibly somewhat  unorthodox
         style of presenting his clients' cases.  He further  accepts  that,
         with hindsight, and in respect of the period between  1  July  2020
         and  2  October  2020,  his  robust  and  determined  approach   to
         representing the Applicants' interests may have meant that  he  has
         pursued matters with more vigour than  some,  unaware  of  all  the
         facts, would think was  appropriate.   He  was  influenced  in  his
         tactical decisions seeking to advance his  clients'  interests  and
         obtain a meaningful remedy  for  them,  by  the  numerous  previous
         refusals by the Respondent  of  the  Applicants'  applications  for
         entry clearance, by the Respondent's refusal to engage properly  in
         the pre-action process, by concerns about the Applicant's state  of
         health  and  advancing  years,  by  the  prospect   that   even   a
         reconsideration of the JR challenged decision might not  result  in
         the outcome the Applicants hoped to achieve and by the Respondent's
         proposed delay in reconsidering the decision, which was not in fact
         reconsidered and notified to  the  Applicants  until  very  shortly
         before the 2 October 2020  hearing.   But  AMR's  conduct  was  not
         unreasonable, in the sense in which that term is to be construed in
         the WCO context."


147. Finally it was submitted on this point  that  Mr  Rosemarine's  conduct
    was not negligent  in  the  sense  that  he  failed  to  act  with  the
    competence reasonably  to  be  expected  of  ordinary  members  of  the
    profession, or in any  other  sense.   Mr  Rosemarine  sought  only  to
    represent his clients and protect their position to  the  best  of  his
    ability.  Mr Rosemarine's conduct should not be judged in hindsight but
    on the basis of information and instructions available to  him  at  the
    relevant time, so far as that can be ascertained in this  case  and  to
    the extent that Mr Rosemarine cannot tell the whole story  for  reasons
    of privilege, he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.


148. Mr Rosemarine is said to have properly  pursued  this  application  for
    Judicial Review on behalf of the Applicants after the offer  to  settle
    on 1 July 2020 for the following reasons.  First, the offer of  1  July
    2020 did not necessarily mean that the proceedings had achieved as much
    as they realistically could have achieved as it remained  open  to  the
    Respondent to refuse the applications on reconsideration for  the  same
    or similar reasons without the assistance of a favourable  judgment  to
    the Applicants on the process adopted, the application of the rules  to
    the applications made and whether there was  a  breach  of  Articles  8
    and/or 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.


149. Secondly, there was every reason for the Applicants to  think  that  on
    any reconsideration of their applications, the Respondent would  refuse
    them again because in the refusal under challenge,  the  decision-maker
    had indicated that any further application was likely  to  be  rejected
    absent  any  change  of  circumstances.   Further,   the   four   month
    reconsideration  period  was  at  odds  with  the  Respondent's  policy
    position for the determination of visit visa applications within  three
    weeks.  In these circumstances, the Applicants instructed Mr Rosemarine
    to continue the application for Judicial Review and  the  circumstances
    were such as to justify a mandatory order to require the Respondent  to
    reconsider the applications in accordance with  the  law  and  her  own
    policy, absent special circumstances.


150. Thirdly, the Applicants were entitled to pursue their  application  for
    declaratory relief of their claimed  breach  of  Article  8  and/or  14
    rights,  which  was  ongoing;  together  with  a  mandatory  order  for
    reconsideration in accordance with an agreed  timescale  in  accordance
    with law and policy.  It is submitted that whilst a mandatory order  is
    not usual, this was not an ordinary case and the fact that  visas  were
    granted shortly before the hearing and less than three months from  the
    grant of permission  was  unusual  and  indicative  that  pressing  for
    substantive relief was appropriate and led the Respondent to reconsider
    the applications lawfully and timeously.


151. Fourthly, the Respondent never formally withdrew or  resiled  from  her
    defence to the claim under the Equality Act or on human rights grounds.


152. Overall, it is submitted that as a matter of law  the  application  for
    Judicial Review was not academic from 1 July 2020, 6 August 2020 or  at
    all and could properly be pursued - it was not  therefore  unreasonable
    to do so to the point where the further decisions were made  and  visas
    issued.  The Upper Tribunal can grant mandatory orders  where  this  is
    the only legally permissible result on  a  claim  (with  such  examples
    given)  and  Mr  Rosemarine  instructed  those  representing  him  that
    therefore he  was  correct  in  pointing  out  the  availability  of  a
    mandatory order in the context of this claim.


153. On behalf of Mr Rosemarine,  it  is  submitted  that  the  Respondent's
    proposed terms of settlement were insufficient to address  all  of  the
    issues in the claim, including the mandatory order sought, whether  the
    circumstances justified a 'rolling review' to challenge any  subsequent
    adverse decision and/or declaratory relief.  As a matter  of  principle
    in these circumstances, a barrister may reasonably advise a  client  to
    continue an application for Judicial Review whilst advising them of the
    litigation risk of doing so.


154. In relation to the exercise of discretion, when Mr  Rosemarine  (though
    his insurers) has already made payment in full to the Respondent of the
    costs incurred; it is submitted that no wasted costs order is necessary
    given that the wasted costs jurisdiction is compensatory not punitive.


155. On 14 April 2021, WBD wrote to the Respondent to offer  her  �5,998  in
    full and final settlement of her assessed costs in this  case  for  the
    period 1 July to 2 October 2020: "to ensure that  (1)  the  Respondent,
    being the party who has incurred  these  costs,  is  not  left  out-of-
    pocket, (2) that further costs are  not  incurred  in  respect  of  any
    dispute relating to those costs and (3) that the  Jarmakanis'  position
    is not prejudiced by any further  order  being  made  against  them  in
    relation to those costs, while (4) leaving open to them their right  to
    pursue their own costs to date, including by applying for permission to
    appeal, should they so wish.  We offer this, despite in our view  there
    being no improper, unreasonable or negligent act on  the  part  of  our
    client, Andrew Rosemarine."  Detailed reasons then followed  which  are
    consistent with the  written  representations  made,  concluding  with:
    "Nevertheless, our client and  his  insurers  accept  that  costs  were
    incurred by SSHD as a result of his clients'  insisting  on  continuing
    this litigation beyond 1 July 2020. ..." and a repetition of  the  four
    points already set out above.


156. The Respondent queried the basis upon which the offer  was  being  made
    on 29 April  2021,  it  being  unclear  why  payment  of  costs  on  Mr
    Rosemarine's behalf was being made absent any acceptance that the Upper
    Tribunal was entitled to make a wasted costs order  against  him.   The
    Respondent further disputed the matters raised in  relation  to  the  2
    October 2020 hearing, which are  not  necessary  to  rehearse  in  this
    decision.


157. On 1 May 2021, WBD replied stating that the reasons  had  already  been
    given in the letter dated 14 April 2021 for the  offer  of  payment  of
    costs, but: "For the avoidance of doubt, however, it  is  not  accepted
    that it is appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to make  a  wasted  costs
    order against our client.  We shall be making representations  to  that
    effect.  Our approach to you was made simply in order  to  ensure  that
    the SSHD receives all that it has claimed for  its  own  costs  and  to
    avoid any future dispute with  SSHD  over  that  sum.   Any  issues  in
    relation to our client's conduct are completely separate  and  will  be
    dealt with in representations on his behalf."   Although the Respondent
    continued to query the basis of the offer  of  payment  of  costs,  the
    amount summarily assessed was paid to the Respondent.

158. For these reasons it is said that there are no longer any wasted  costs
    to be compensated and therefore no need for any  further  order  to  be
    made in relation to the Respondent's  costs  assessed  in  the  sum  of
    �5,998.


159. In relation to privilege not having been waived, it is  submitted  that
    Mr Rosemarine is constrained  in  his  ability  to  fully  explain  his
    position to the Upper Tribunal as well as to those  instructed  on  his
    behalf.  In particular, it is stated that Mr Rosemarine is unable to go
    beyond a letter dated 27 January  2021  from  Mager,  Hisham  and  Sana
    Jarmakani in which it is confirmed that: "our Barrister  Mr  Rosemarine
    advised us at all stages that there was a  high  risk  of  costs  being
    awarded against us, if we continued our JR case  after  01  July  2020.
    However,  due  to  receiving  no  acceptable  response  from   the   HO
    representative we insisted that Mr Rosemarine continues  nonetheless.".
     Nor can any submissions  be  made  on  the  fact  or  content  of  any
    discussions or advice with the Applicants or Interested Parties; nor as
    to the fact or content of instructions given to Mr Rosemarine.


160. The written representations rely on the decision in Medcalf  v  Mardell
    (Wasted Costs Order) [2003] 1 AC 120 which at paragraph 23 stated that:
    "... Where a wasted  costs  order  is  sought  against  a  practitioner
    precluded by legal professional privilege from giving his  full  answer
    to the  application,  the  court  should  not  make  an  order  unless,
    proceeding with extreme care, it is (a) satisfied that there is nothing
    the practitioner could say, if unconstrained, to resist the  order  and
    (b) that it is in all the circumstances fair to make the order.".


161. The written representations do refer in one other part to  instructions
    given to Mr Rosemarine, however they make no reference at  all  to  the
    very detailed written statement from Mager  Jarmakani  dated  30  April
    2021 in support of his application for permission to appeal (save for a
    reference in paragraph 106 of the submissions to this document and  its
    broad support of Mr Rosemarine),  which  includes  an  account  of  the
    instructions given to Mr Rosemarine and expressly states  that  a  copy
    has been provided to WBD.  The statement  contains  details  of  advice
    given and instructions which have been provided to the  Upper  Tribunal
    by the Interested Party acting as representative of the Applicants;  as
    well as  to  those  acting  on  behalf  of  Mr  Rosemarine.   In  these
    circumstances, whilst the representations in support of  Mr  Rosemarine
    and against any wasted costs order being made were inappropriate in the
    context of an application for permission to appeal and on matters which
    were primarily for Mr Rosemarine to respond to, I have also taken these
    matters in to account when making my decision on this point.


162. In particular, I have noted the positive endorsements given  as  to  Mr
    Rosemarine's services to the Applicants and as to the  advice  received
    from him and instructions  that  were  given  to  him  to  pursue  this
    application for Judicial Review, set out primarily in paragraphs 49  to
    55 of the statement as follows:


         "49. Our barrister warned us at  all  stages  of  possible  adverse
         costs  consequences  from  Immigration  Judges.   Especially  those
         unsympathetic to elderly Parents, fearing death, before ever seeing
         their Children and Grandchildren.  After SSHD offered to reconsider
         our visa applications within an indefinite "4 months +++",  we  had
         already been waiting a year for our paid for visa,  (and  17  years
         because of previous SSHD  refusals).   So  we  gave  our  Barrister
         instructions  to  maintain  pressure  on  SSHD,  by   maintain   JR
         proceedings  on  SSHD,  so   that   SSHD   might   speed   up   its
         reconsideration, for fear of possible criticism of SSHD by the High
         Court or UTIAC, and to enable possible judicial help in getting  us
         our visas faster than an indefinite yet further 4 months +++.


         50.  Our  Barrister  made  clear  to  us  that  our   pursuing   JR
         proceedings, after IJ  Rintoul's  pressure  on  us  to  close  down
         proceedings,  was  against  our  Barrister's  own  interests.   We,
         nonetheless, insisted to help us.  Because SSHD's July  2020  offer
         of 4 months +++ gave us nothing of our main  purpose  in  launching
         proceedings: getting our visas.


         51. I instructed our Barrister, on behalf of our entire family,  on
         a private access basis.  He has explained  all  documents  in  this
         case to me and possible consequences.  We have sought advice often.
          He also advised us of the possible consequences of our not signing
         the SSHD's unsigned draft Consent Order of 01 July 2020 but it  was
         my family's decision to instruct our Barrister  to  continue  these
         proceedings.


         52. Our Barrister advised concision and simplicity, when  the  SSHD
         required three lots  more  of  yet  further  evidence  from  us  in
         September 2020.  He has told  us  often  that  Less  can  be  More,
         meaning it's better to file a few forceful focused pages, than much
         lengthier documents.


         53.  The correspondence which we instructed  him  to  send  to  the
         SSHD,  was  on  our  instructions.   We  instructed  them,  in  the
         emergency circumstances of  our  being  vulnerable  to  death  from
         covid.  We could not wait for continuing SSHD delays, already  over
         15 times the SSHD's own official Guidance times.


         54. SSHD never replied to any of our correspondence.  If  SSHD  had
         replied to it, we would not have instructed him  to  write  further
         correspondence, to which Judge Jackson appears to object.  We would
         not have made the applications, to which Judge Jackson  appears  to
         object.


         55. Our Barrister explained to us, at all stages,  that  successful
         JR litigants never win all their costs.  So we insisted he  do  all
         he could to try and help us get as  much  costs  as  possible  from
         SSHD, to try  and  cover  as  much  of  our  outlay  and  debts  as
         possible."


Wasted costs - discussion


163. I deal first  with  the  issue  of  privilege  raised  in  the  written
    representations on behalf of Mr Rosemarine as to some extent the points
    relied on must be viewed within the context of what he has and has  not
    been able to say.  It is said that Mr Rosemarine is constrained in what
    he has been able to say in response to issues raised as to his  conduct
    in  these  proceedings  because  the  Applicants  have  not   expressly
    consented to the use  of  privilege  material  between  them  (and  the
    Interested Parties) and Mr Rosemarine; save for a  statement  from  the
    Applicants and  Interested  Parties  confirming  that  they  have  been
    advised at all  times  of  the  risk  of  an  adverse  costs  order  in
    continuing the application for Judicial Review after 1 July  2020,  but
    gave instructions to continue nonetheless.


164. As above, however there is far more  detailed  information  before  the
    Upper Tribunal as to the advice sought and received by  the  Applicants
    and the instructions  given  to  Mr  Rosemarine  in  relation  to  this
    application in the statement from Mager Jarmakani.  Whilst WBD  do  not
    act for either of the Applicants or the Interested Party (and it is not
    therefore suggested that they had any involvement in  the  drafting  of
    the written statement), they were aware of both the  contents  of  this
    statement having been provided with it by Mager Jarmakani and the  fact
    that it had been submitted to the Upper Tribunal (as expressly noted in
    the written representations on behalf  of  MR  Rosemarine).   In  these
    circumstances, it  is  of  significant  concern  that  in  the  written
    representations, Ms Naik QC has either failed to turn her mind to  this
    detailed evidence at all or failed to explain why  the  submissions  on
    privilege remained appropriate in spite  of  the  detailed  disclosures
    made as to advice and instructions given.  To simply  assert  privilege
    has not been  waived  without  dealing  with  this  material  does  not
    accurately refer to or reflect the  objective  assessment  required  of
    whether privilege can properly be asserted  and  relied  upon  in  such
    circumstances.


165. Although there does not appear to have  been  express  consent  by  the
    Applicants or Interested Parties (themselves or as  representatives  of
    the Applicants) for the use of privileged material  by  Mr  Rosemarine;
    there has been a deliberate disclosure of detailed information by Mager
    Jarmakani in these proceedings which I find is a waiver of privilege in
    accordance with the principles in Great Atlantic Insurance  Co  v  Home
    Insurance Co [1981] 1 WLR 529 further  to  which  privilege  cannot  be
    asserted in relation to other material of the same subject matter (here
    the legal advice from and instructions to Counsel in  this  application
    for Judicial Review)  as  a  matter  of  fairness  to  prevent  'cherry
    picking'.   Mr  Rosemarine  cannot  in  these  circumstances  rely   on
    privilege to claim the benefit of the doubt in relation to  matters  of
    conduct raised in these proceedings.  In any event, first, there is  in
    fact information before the Upper Tribunal  which  can  be  taken  into
    account, and secondly, there are a number of issues  raised  as  to  Mr
    Rosemarine's conduct to which the nature of advice and instructions can
    have no material bearing given the standards to be reasonably  expected
    of a barrister and in light of their professional duty to the  Tribunal
    (see further below).


166. In making the decision on whether a wasted costs order should be  made,
    I will consider the  following  three  questions.   First,  whether  Mr
    Rosemarine acted improperly, unreasonably or negligently?  Secondly, if
    so, did such conduct cause the Respondent to incur  unnecessary  costs?
    Finally, if so, is it in all the circumstances  of  the  case  just  to
    order the legal representative to compensate  the  Respondent  for  the
    whole or any part of the relevant costs?


167. The meaning attributed to the parts of the first test has been set  out
    by the Court of Appeal in Ridehalgh v Horsefield as follows:


           - "Improper" means what it has been understood to mean  in  this
             context for at least half a century.   The  adjective  covers,
             but is not confined to, conduct which would ordinarily be held
             to justify disbarment, striking off, suspension from  practice
             or  other  serious  professional  penalty.   It   covers   any
             significant breach of a substantial duty imposed by a relevant
             code of professional conduct.  But it is not in  our  judgment
             limited to that.  Conduct which would be regarded as  improper
             according  to  the  consensus   of   professional   (including
             judicial) opinion can be fairly stigmatised as such whether or
             not it violates the letter of a professional code.


           - "Unreasonable" also means what is has been understood to  mean
             in this context for at least half a century.   The  expression
             aptly describes conduct which is vexatious, designed to harass
             the other side rather than advance resolution of the case, and
             it makes no difference that the  conduct  is  the  produce  of
             excessive zeal and not improper motive.  But conduct cannot be
             described as unreasonable simply because it leads in the event
             to an unsuccessful result or because other more cautious legal
             representatives would have acted different.  The acid test  is
             whether the conduct permits of a reasonable  explanation.   If
             so, the course adopted may be regarded as  optimistic  and  as
             reflecting  on  a  practitioner's  judgment,  but  it  is  not
             unreasonable.


           - "Negligent" should be understood  in  an  untechnical  way  to
             denote failure to act with the  competence  reasonably  to  be
             expected of ordinary members of the profession.


168. The written representations submitted on behalf of Mr Rosemarine  focus
    primarily on the issue of whether this application for Judicial  Review
    became academic on or after 1 July 2020 when the Respondent proposed  a
    draft  consent  order  to  settle  proceedings;  and  whether  it   was
    reasonable to pursue the application beyond that point.   However,  the
    conduct  during  this  period  included  not  only  pursuance  of   the
    application  for  Judicial  Review  per  se;  but  also  the   repeated
    applications made to the Upper Tribunal, in  particular  those  seeking
    indemnity  and/or  wasted  costs  against  the  Respondent   and   more
    generally,  the  approach  to  settlement   (or   otherwise)   of   the
    application.  I deal first with the pursuit  of  this  application  for
    Judicial Review beyond 1 July 2020 and return to the other matters.


169. I have already given detailed reasons above as to why this  application
    for Judicial Review was rendered academic by the Respondent's  proposed
    consent order on 1 July 2020 above.   The  written  representations  on
    behalf of Mr Rosemarine refer to some extent to some of  those  matters
    already considered above and to other points not raised or relied  upon
    by the Applicants or Mr Rosemarine in the course of correspondence with
    the Respondent or in submissions to the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  former
    included the  concern  that  the  Respondent  would  again  refuse  the
    applications upon reconsideration, in part in  reliance  on  the  cover
    letter to decisions which had been withdrawn; which  has  already  been
    dealt with above.


170. The points not previously relied  upon  include:  (i)  the  four  month
    reconsideration period being at  odds  with  the  Respondent's  general
    position that visit visa applications should be determined within three
    weeks; (ii) the circumstances of the claim justified the  making  of  a
    mandatory order (either to grant the  visit  visa  applications  or  to
    reconsider the applications for the same in accordance with the law and
    the Respondent's own policy); (iii) the  Applicants  were  entitled  to
    pursue their application  for  declaratory  relief  for  their  claimed
    breach of Articles 8 and/or 14 of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights; (iv) the Respondent not having formally  withdrawn  or  resiled
    from her defence to the human rights claim or claim under the  Equality
    Act 2010; and (v) the circumstances of the claim may justify a 'rolling
    review' to challenge any subsequent adverse decision.


171. The first point was never expressly relied upon by or on behalf of  the
    Applicants in correspondence with the Respondent or in  the  course  of
    submissions to the Upper Tribunal.  As above, save  for  one  piece  of
    correspondence with the Upper Tribunal, the Applicants  never  proposed
    an alternative time period for reconsideration of the  decisions  (with
    reference to the usual service delivery timescales  or  otherwise)  and
    instead only proposed a mandatory order for the grant of visas.  In any
    event, the Respondent did in fact reconsider the applications and grant
    entry clearance as visitors to the Applicants within  three  months  of
    the proposed consent order, quicker than proposed in the draft  consent
    order sent on 1 July 2020 and quicker than would have been  likely  had
    the application proceeded to a substantive hearing on the merits of the
    claim (rather than solely on the issue of costs).


172. As to the second point, although it is within the power  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal to grant a mandatory order as to the outcome  of  a  decision,
    this  is  rare  and  only  realistically  (rather  than  theoretically)
    possible in extreme  cases  where  there  could  only  be  one  legally
    permissible outcome to the application made.  The  present  application
    for Judicial Review fell very far below such a case on the facts,  even
    if the Applicants  had  ultimately  been  successful  on  every  ground
    pursued  in  the  application.   During  the  substantive  hearing,  Mr
    Rosemarine was asked  three  times  the  basis  upon  which  the  Upper
    Tribunal could or would have granted a mandatory  order  requiring  the
    Respondent to grant entry clearance as visitors to the  Applicants,  to
    which no coherent answer was given and only an assertion  that  it  had
    been proved that the refusals were in breach of human rights, the Upper
    Tribunal is bound by the EEA Regulations (under  which  the  Applicants
    had never made any application and which formed no part of the  grounds
    of this application for Judicial Review) and it had  been  proved  that
    there was a breach of the Equality Act.  However, at its  highest,  the
    Upper Tribunal had granted permission on the basis that  the  claim  on
    the pleaded grounds was arguable, not that any breaches of human rights
    or the Equality Act had been  proved.   No  further  or  more  detailed
    submissions were made on this point, despite it  also  being  expressly
    relied upon by the Respondent.  The mere  possibility  of  a  mandatory
    order, devoid of any assessment of the merits of achieving the same  by
    reference to the facts of this case does not support the assertion that
    the claim was even 'not necessarily' academic, let alone any  assertion
    that it was not in fact academic.


173. The third and fourth  points  are  wholly  irrelevant  given  that  the
    Applicants  never  sought  a  declaration  that  the  decisions   under
    challenge were in breach  of  Article  8  and/or  14  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights; nor was any declaration  or  remedy  sought
    specifically in relation to the Equality Act 2010.   Neither  of  these
    matters were raised by or on behalf of the Applicants in correspondence
    with the Respondent following the proposed  consent  order  on  1  July
    2020, and although there was some reference to  these  matters  forming
    part of the pleaded case in the skeleton argument submitted immediately
    prior to the hearing they were not pursued orally  at  the  substantive
    hearing and no remedy in respect of them was ever  sought  or  purused.
    In these circumstances, these were clearly not matters which  indicated
    that the application was not rendered academic by the offer to withdraw
    and reconsider the applications, particularly in circumstances where it
    had been confirmed no later than 6 August 2020 that the algorithm would
    not be used in any reconsideration.


174. The final point as to whether this would be an appropriate case  for  a
    'rolling review' is raised more as a  question  rather  than  with  any
    positive submission  that  the  present  case  would  be  suitable  for
    'rolling review' to challenge any subsequent adverse decision  and  the
    same  would  go  against  the  very  significant  caution  against  the
    appropriateness of the same expressed repeatedly by the higher  courts.
    This is not a case which would even arguably be appropriate for such  a
    'rolling review' and in any event, the Applicants' case simply was  not
    pursued on that basis - there was no proposed  consent  order  or  even
    correspondence with the  Respondent  about  the  possibility.   At  its
    highest, there was a single piece  of  correspondence  with  the  Upper
    Tribunal in which it was suggested that proceedings be stayed until one
    month after the reconsideration decision  (which  was  refused  by  the
    Upper Tribunal at the time).


175. I have also taken into  account  the  evidence  before  me  as  to  the
    Applicants' instructions to pursue the application for Judicial Review,
    despite being advised as to the adverse costs of  doing  so.   However,
    for the reasons given above, there was no rational basis upon which  it
    could be said  that  the  claims  were  anything  other  than  academic
    following the proposed consent order on 1 July 2020 and the issues  now
    said to have been of concern with the terms proposed at the time simply
    did not feature in the inter-partes correspondence or  the  submissions
    to the Upper Tribunal in relation to  this  issue  at  the  substantive
    hearing.


176. I return to Mr  Rosemarine's  conduct  more  generally,  including  the
    nature of the correspondence with the Respondent which failed  entirely
    to  constructively  engage  with  the  possibility  of   a   reasonable
    settlement of this application for Judicial Review and the  pursuit  of
    multiple applications to the  Upper  Tribunal  which  had  no  arguable
    foundation or merit.  These are the areas referred to above to which  I
    do not consider the nature of advice or instructions,  whether  or  not
    privilege was waived expressly or by the detailed parts of the  witness
    statement from Mager Jarmakani, to have any  material  bearing  because
    they relate  to  matters  of  competence  and  what  can  properly  and
    appropriately be pursued before the Upper Tribunal.


177. I have set out in detail above the history  of  correspondence  between
    the Applicants/Mr Rosemarine and the Respondent following the  proposed
    consent order on 1 July 2020 up to the date of  hearing  on  2  October
    2020; as well as the applications made to  the  Upper  Tribunal  during
    this time,  an  example  of  which  is  quoted  from  directly  and  is
    representative of the nature of correspondence to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    and to the Respondence, and of matters relied upon  repeatedly  therein
    by Mr Rosemarine.  The nature and content  of  that  correspondence  on
    behalf the Applicants speaks for itself.


178. For the reasons set out above, there was no reasonable  or  appropriate
    form of consent proposed by or on behalf of  the  Applicants;  or  even
    rational correspondence engaging with the substance of the issues.  The
    tone  and  substance  of  what  was  proposed  on  each  occasion   was
    inappropriate and would not have been approved by  the  Upper  Tribunal
    even had it been agreed by the Respondent.  For example, the  terms  of
    consent were drafted using inflammatory language; they  inappropriately
    included in the terms of the order explanations for it; they  contained
    contradictory provisions; they contained provisions which  were  wholly
    premature and included matters which were wholly outwith the  scope  of
    remedies sought or relevant to this application  for  Judicial  Review.
    It is  notable  that  the  written  representations  on  behalf  of  Mr
    Rosemarine do not engage at all with  any  of  these  proposed  consent
    orders.  The draft consent orders proposed on behalf of the  Applicants
    were not drafted to a competent standard to be reasonably expected of a
    member of the profession and do not indicate any proper engagement with
    the Respondent with a view to resolving any matters  of  substance  but
    focused instead on ancillary matters of costs which  could  and  should
    have been proportionately dealt with  by  written  submissions  in  the
    absence of agreement.


179. The written  representations  also  fail  to  engage  at  all  with  Mr
    Rosemarine's conduct in the days immediately prior to the hearing on  2
    October 2020, during which despite he/the Applicants expressly agreeing
    that an oral hearing was wholly inappropriate and  unnecessary  on  the
    sole issue of costs; there was a refusal to  sign  a  proposed  consent
    order (in terms also substantively  suggested  as  appropriate  by  the
    Upper Tribunal) to settle the claim with  the  issue  of  costs  to  be
    determined on the papers following written submissions.   There  is  no
    explanation at all as to why that proposed form of consent was rejected
    and therefore why the Applicants forced the oral  hearing  to  proceed;
    nor could there be any rational explanation for the rejection  of  this
    offer in all of the circumstances given at that stage,  the  Respondent
    had granted the applications (even if the physical visas  had  not  yet
    been received by the Applicants, a matter which  was  no  more  than  a
    formality).  Ultimately, the hearing was attended on the sole issue  of
    costs but without proper preparation for the  same  on  behalf  of  the
    Applicants, for example, there was no costs schedule and  even  on  the
    issue of principle of liability for costs, Mr Rosemarine's  submissions
    were based on legal authority which was many years out of date.


180. On behalf of Mr Rosemarine,  it  is  said  that  it  was  not  poor  or
    inappropriate to seek indemnity costs on behalf of  the  Applicants  in
    the circumstances of the claim and where there is precedent for such an
    award where a defendant acts carelessly or fails  to  make  appropriate
    disclosure, by reference to the case of R  (O).   However,  again  this
    submission amounts to no more than the theoretical possibility of  such
    an award  without  any  objective  assessment  of  the  facts  of  this
    application for Judicial Review or whether there were proper grounds to
    make the application in this case.  The applications made to the  Upper
    Tribunal, on more than one occasion, were for indemnity  and/or  wasted
    costs (or wasted damages) with  no  distinction  between  the  two,  no
    reliance on R (O) and no properly pleaded basis for either claim beyond
    unsubstantiated allegations against the  Respondent  and/or  her  legal
    representatives; which as above,  were  wholly  unfounded  and  without
    merit.  There is no rational or objective basis upon  which  the  Upper
    Tribunal could have even arguably awarded the Applicants their costs on
    an indemnity basis, nor awarded wasted costs  against  the  Respondent.
    It is also of note that ultimately this was not pursued at the  hearing
    on 2 October 2020 despite the only issue being costs.


181. Taking into account all of  the  matters  set  out  in  this  decision,
    whilst  Mr  Rosemarine's  conduct  may  not  reach  the  threshold   of
    'improper' as set out and understood in Ridehalgh, (although  at  least
    some of the examples of submissions made were arguably improper)  I  do
    conclude  that  it  was,  considered  as  a  whole,  unreasonable   and
    negligent.  The pursuit of the application  for  Judicial  Review,  but
    more significantly the nature  of  correspondence  to  and  allegations
    against the Respondent together with repeated  applications  for  costs
    without proper foundation were wholly unreasonable  and  permit  of  no
    reasonable explanation.  The applications  made  and  proposed  consent
    orders cannot be described in any way as advancing a resolution of  the
    case, but on their face appear antagonistic and designed to harrass.


182. A number of factors have been set out  as  to  the  motivation  for  Mr
    Rosemarine acting in the way that he did, in what he saw  as  advancing
    his clients' interests, does not detract from an  objective  assessment
    of the conduct itself.  The same issues fall equally under the  heading
    of negligence, with Mr Rosemarine's pursuit  of  this  application  for
    Judicial Review after 1 July 2020, including the  lack  of  any  proper
    engagement to  resolve  the  outstanding  issues  and  the  pursuit  of
    unfounded  applications  for  costs  fall  far  below  the   competence
    reasonably to be expected  of  ordinary  members  of  the  bar.   Mager
    Jarmakani's statement indicates that Mr Rosemarine  was  instructed  to
    try to cover as much of their costs as possible in the proceedings, but
    that does not excuse the  pursuit  of  applications  without  legal  or
    evidential foundation for indemnity costs and/or wasted costs.  To  the
    contrary, the recovery of the greatest proportion of costs  would  have
    been achieved by agreement to the consent  order  proposed  in  1  July
    2020; a matter which the Applicants were repeatedly warned about by the
    Upper Tribunal.


183. The answer to the first question is therefore that  Mr  Rosemarine  has
    acted unreasonably or negligently and as above, there is no benefit  of
    the doubt to be given for reasons of privilege as this has been waived.


184. As to the second question,  the  Respondent  has  incurred  unnecessary
    costs in the period from 1 July 2020; a matter which has  already  been
    expressly accepted on behalf of Mr  Rosemarine  in  the  correspondence
    from WBD to the Respondent dated 14 April 2021.


185. The final question is whether in all the circumstances it  is  just  to
    order Mr Rosemarine to compensate the Respondent for the whole  or  any
    part of the relevant costs.  Taking into account all of the matters set
    out above, it is just for the Respondent  to  be  compensated  for  the
    unnecessary costs incurred in the pursuit of this application after  an
    entirely appropriate and reasonable form of consent was proposed  on  1
    July 2020 and  I  therefore  make  a  wasted  costs  order  against  Mr
    Rosemarine to pay the Respondent's reasonable costs from 1 July 2020.


186. In so deciding I have taken into account  the  written  representations
    on behalf of Mr Rosemarine that no such order should  be  made  because
    there are no longer any of the Respondent's  costs  outstanding;  these
    having been paid in full by  Mr  Rosemarine's  insurers  prior  to  the
    written representations initially submitted.  The reasons given for the
    offer of payment of these costs, without any acceptance of liability or
    that a wasted costs order could be made against Mr Rosemarine, are very
    difficult to understand.  Those that were given  in  correspondence  on
    the issue made little sense, for example,  there  was  no  prospect  of
    further costs being incurred as to the  dispute  of  quantum  or  costs
    generally (save for  any  application  for  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision which is not avoided by the payment of costs in any event) nor
    any prospect of the Applicants' position being  prejudiced.   It  would
    also be wholly unusual for a professional individual  to  be  concerned
    about the Respondent 'being  left  out  of  pocket'  in  a  case  which
    ultimately was only on the highly  contested  issue  of  liability  for
    costs.


187. The only basis for the submission that once costs  have  been  paid  no
    order  should  be  made  is  that  the  wasted  costs  jurisdiction  is
    compensatory rather than punitive and therefore not  appropriate  where
    the Respondent's costs have already been paid.  However,  the  fact  of
    payment, in advance of any decision does not affect  the  principle  of
    liability for a wasted costs order.  Further, whether well intended for
    the reasons set out in the correspondence from WBD  or  otherwise,  the
    appropriateness of such payment in  circumstances  where  there  is  no
    admission of any improper, unreasonable or negligence conduct would  at
    least be  questionable  as  a  matter  of  principle  as  it  could  be
    inappropriately used as a means of seeking to avoid  the  making  of  a
    wasted costs order or the consequences thereof.


188. In all of the circumstances of this case, the making of a wasted  costs
    order is appropriate, the practical result,  primarily  caused  by  the
    delay in the hand-down of this decision and Mr  Rosemarine's  proactive
    insurers, is simply that such order has been satisfied already.


Quantum of costs

189. Finally, I deal with the issue of quantum of costs.  On the basis  that
    this substantive hearing was only as to the issue of costs, it was  not
    only part of the procedural rules but also  reasonable  to  expect  the
    parties to have attended that hearing properly prepared on that  issue,
    including with a schedule of costs and to allow court time to  be  more
    effectively used, as well as the parties' own resources,  by  including
    summary assessment of costs.  The Respondent filed a costs schedule  as
    required but the Applicants did not, initially claiming that  it  would
    take too long (despite adequate notice of the issue of  costs  and  the
    hearing date having been given and Counsel, who  should  reasonably  be
    expected to be aware of the procedural requirements) and that it  would
    be too complex.  A document headed schedule of costs but which was  not
    one, in form or substance, was filed shortly before the hearing but not
    suitable for use for the assessment of summary costs.  I  am  therefore
    unable to make any assessment of the Applicants' reasonable  costs  due
    to their failure to comply with basic requirements and  directions  for
    the same.  This is a matter which should be taken into  account  should
    any future detailed assessment of costs be required  as  it  is  likely
    that the Respondent will incur yet further costs  unnecessarily  for  a
    matter which could and  should  have  been  dealt  with  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal at this substantive hearing only on costs.


190. I would also reiterate to the Applicants that the  award  of  costs  to
    them is for their reasonable costs only up to 30 June 2020 and my  view
    is that the costs indicated on  their  behalf  so  far,  in  excess  of
    �33,000, are very far in excess of what is reasonable in the context of
    this case and are grossly disproportionate.


191. In relation to the Respondent's costs, I make a summary  assessment  of
    her costs from 1 July 2020 to the date of hearing in the sum of  �5998.
    The costs schedule submitted contains reasonable costs incurred in this
    period, which have not been challenged in substance as to  quantum  (as
    opposed to an award of costs in principle) by the Applicants.


Professional conduct

192. The notice to show cause also gave Mr  Rosemarine  the  opportunity  to
    make  representations  as  to  his  professional   conduct   in   these
    proceedings and specifically during the  oral  hearing.   A  number  of
    examples  have  been  given  throughout  this  decision  of  poor   and
    inappropriate conduct, to which can  be  added  unprofessional  conduct
    towards Ms Thelen during the hearing (for example, calling her  by  her
    first name  and  accusing  her  of  submitting  a  factually  incorrect
    skeleton argument) and  unprofessional  presentation  of  documentation
    (including hand written  commentary  on  documents  as  well  as  typed
    commentary altering original documents in the bundle;  documents  which
    are  not  as  described  and  which  include  excessive  use  of  bold,
    underlining and large fonts).


193. The written representations as  to  Mr  Rosemarine's  conduct  in  this
    application for Judicial Review relied heavily on the  matters  already
    raised in response to the notice to show cause as to wasted costs.   It
    is said that Mr Rosemarine  did  not  act  poorly,  inappropriately  or
    unreasonably  in  continuing  to  pursue   a   remedy   not   achieved,
    notwithstanding a partial success and  the  fact  that  the  Respondent
    ultimately granted entry clearance on essentially the same  application
    as originally made (with  some  updating  confirmation)  justified  the
    manner in which litigation was conducted to achieve  a  favourable  and
    swift outcome for the Applicants which would not  have  otherwise  been
    achieved had Mr Rosemarine not acted in the way in which he did.


194. In relation specifically to Mr Rosemarine seeking  indemnity  costs  on
    behalf of the Applicants, this was reasonably pursued in  circumstances
    where  the  Respondent  had  been  obstructive  from  the  outset,  had
    unreasonably refused the Applicants' applications on several occasions,
    had refused to properly engage with the Applicants  in  the  pre-action
    process and would not disclose the algorithm  or  policy  and  guidance
    documents sought pre-action in the application.  In such circumstances,
    there is precedent for an award of indemnity costs where the  defendant
    acts carelessly or fails to make appropriate disclosure, such as  in  R
    (O) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department)  [2010]  EWHC  709
    (Admin).  Further, it is said to be an arguable error of  law  for  the
    Upper Tribunal to have refused  the  request  for  indemnity  costs  in
    failing to consider the binding precedent in R (O)


195. In relation to the request to set aside Judge  McWilliam's  refusal  of
    permission to apply for Judicial Review on the  papers,  Mr  Rosemarine
    was  successful  in  overturning  the  refusal  and  the  costs  order.
    However,  the  application  to  set  aside  itself   was   refused   as
    procedurally inappropriate.


196. It was said to be appropriate for  Mr  Rosemarine  to  argue  that  the
    Respondent's Acknowledgment of Service was out  of  time  and  that  an
    application to reinstate the proceedings be made when it was struck out
    due to an administrative error.   Further,  it  was  neither  poor  nor
    inappropriate for Mr Rosemaine to advise  the  Applicants  to  seek  an
    order that the Respondent should make a fresh decision within a  period
    of one month in all of the circumstances and that for the  period  from
    23 September 2020 to 2 October 2020, Mr Rosemarine acted correctly  and
    appropriately through is efforts to resolve the position to  avoid  the
    substantive hearing.


197. In relation to Mr Rosemarine's conduct towards  Ms  Thelen  during  the
    hearing, it is submitted that this was not unprofessional and  went  no
    further than the normal challenges to  an  opponent  in  a  contentious
    hearing.


198. Overall, it is submitted Mr Rosemarine provided  a  competent  standard
    of work to his clients and at all times observed his duty to the  Court
    in the administration of justice, such that there was no breach of  any
    of the BSB Handbook Core Duties.  Although some  of  the  written  work
    included varying font sizes, bold and underlining,  this  was  used  to
    emphasise  points  and  highlight  issues;  and   resulted   from   the
    constraints  of  Mr  Rosemarine  preparing  documentation  on  his  own
    computer without any IT assistance, or on many occasions,  applications
    were prepared by litigants in person (albeit no  specific  applications
    or examples were identified in the submissions).


199. My conclusions as to Mr Rosemarine's professional conduct  go  hand  in
    hand with the matters already set  out  throughout  this  judgment,  in
    particular the reasons already given for the making of a  wasted  costs
    order against him for the Respondent's costs in the period from 1  July
    2020.  There is little that needs to be  specifically  added  to  this.
    For the reasons already given, Mr Rosemarine failed to engage with  the
    Upper Tribunal or the Respondent in a professional or competent manner.
     This included pursuit of applications since 1 July 2020 without  merit
    or proper foundation (an example of which is set out above in  relation
    to one of the applications  for  indemnity  and/or  wasted  costs);  he
    proposed consent orders which were unreasonable and irrational; he made
    submissions which were wholly unprofessional and inappropriate (both in
    writing  and  orally,  in  substance  and  in  the  manner   of   their
    presentation) and even if the Applicants specifically instructed him to
    proceed in this way, that conduct  fell  far  short  of  the  standards
    reasonably to be expected taking into  account  Counsel's  professional
    duties to the Upper Tribunal.  In all of the circumstances, a  copy  of
    this decision will be referred to the  Bar  Standards  Board,  together
    with the approved transcript of the hearing on 2 October 2020 and  such
    documents as are required from the Upper Tribunal file.

Permission to appeal

200. At the time that it was initially planned to hand  down  this  decision
    in January 2021, there were significant restrictions in  place  due  to
    the Covid-19 pandemic such that it was proposed that  no  oral  hearing
    would  be  listed  for  the  hand  down  of  the  decision,  with   any
    consequential orders or applications to be made in  writing  and  dealt
    with on the papers.  This included any application(s) for permission to
    appeal and corresponding extensions of time for the same were given  to
    the  same  dates  as  for  written  representations  on  behalf  of  Mr
    Rosemarine.


201. In accordance with these directions, on 5 May 2021 the Applicants  made
    a written application for permission to appeal the decision  that  they
    were not entitled to their reasonable costs  from  1  July  2020.   The
    application was supported by a written statement from  Mager  Jamarkani
    as representative of the Applicants and Interested Party.  The majority
    of that document is  directed  to  the  notice  to  show  cause  to  Mr
    Rosemarine in relation to  the  issue  of  wasted  costs  and  includes
    statements that a number of a points during  the  hearing  and  in  the
    draft judgment  initially  circulated  were  prejudicial  and  punitive
    against Mr Rosemarine, as well as punishing to the Applicants in  terms
    of costs.


202. In relation to the substance of the costs  claim  (not  wasted  costs),
    the statement refers to an appropriate rejection  of  the  Respondent's
    proposed consent order in July 2020 on the basis  of  the  "outrageous"
    request for an indefinite "4 months from the  date  of  sealing  absent
    special circumstances" time for reconsideration  of  the  applications;
    contrary to the Respondent's guidance that a decision on an application
    for entry clearance should be given within three weeks - a matter which
    it was said the Respondent was under a duty to draw to the attention of
    the Upper Tribunal in this application.  The statement  further  refers
    to the Applicants' circumstances and  unfairness  in  the  handling  of
    their applications for entry clearance as visitors made in August  2019
    and the concern  of  a  further  refusal  when  the  applications  were
    reconsidered.


203. After lengthy criticisms of the Respondent (in substance  the  same  as
    those made during the course of this application  for  Judicial  Review
    and in oral submissions on 2 October 2020), the only possible error  of
    law identified in the statement is that I failed to taken into  account
    that it was only because of the repeated pressure on the Respondent  by
    Mr Rosemarine, together with continuing  judicial  scrutiny,  that  the
    Applicants' visas were ultimately granted, or  granted  as  quickly  as
    they were.  The reasons identified for this again rehearsed the history
    of proceedings and alleged bad faith by the Respondent, with the timing
    of the grant of visas  said  to  prove  the  unreasonable  periods  for
    reconsideration previously offered and the positive outcome because  of
    the maintenance of pressure from the Judicial Review application.


204. Finally it was also stated that the unavoidable  complexities  of  this
    application for Judicial Review, which caused far higher costs  than  a
    normal High Court case, were all overlooked by the Upper Tribunal.


205. The application for permission  to  appeal  is  refused.   Despite  the
    lengthy statement submitted in support of it, no arguable errors of law
    are identified in the costs decision in relation to the Applicants  and
    the document fails to engage in the reasons given for the decision that
    the Applicants are only entitled to their reasonable  costs  up  to  30
    June 2020.  The matters referred to as to the  procedural  history  and
    correspondence between the parties  have  all  been  fully  taken  into
    account.


206. There is no application for permission to appeal by or on behalf of  Mr
    Rosemarine against the wasted costs order and in  any  event  I  refuse
    permission to appeal as there  is  no  arguable  error  of  law  in  my
    decision on this.

to be incurred as  a  consequence.   The  instructions  did  not  extend  to
attendance at Field House to listen to  the  audio  recording.   These  were
