Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr O Lot, Victory Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs Vidyadharan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless  I  will  refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    described before the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  is  Ms  Pham  as  the
    appellant and the Secretary of State as the respondent.

 2. The appellant was born on 22nd June 1983 and is a citizen  of  Vietnam.
    On 20th September 2012 she made an application for entry  clearance  to
    join her husband Mr Lokman Maroof Zadeh.  Her application  was  refused
    on 6th December 2012 and she brought an appeal against that decision.

 3. The respondent in the refusal notice noted that the  appellant  married
    her husband who is a UK national on 18th November 2011 and appeared  to
    be in a genuine relationship but in  view  of  her  character  and  her
    conduct in her complete disregard for the UK  immigration  law  it  was
    considered undesirable to issue  an  appellant  with  entry  clearance.
    Records held at the office showed that the appellant travelled  to  the
    UK on 12th May 2003 from France with no visa or valid  leave  to  enter
    and immediately sought leave to remain for an indefinite  period.   She
    was granted temporary admission while her  application  was  considered
    and placed on reporting restrictions and a decision was made in the  UK
    to refuse her application on 10th November 2004.  Records held that the
    respondent's office showed that the appellant  subsequently  failed  to
    report to the Home Office and was registered as an  absconder  on  17th
    May 2005.  She then stayed illegally in the UK until 2009 and was  next
    encountered boarding a flight to Vietnam on 28th May 2009.

 4. Her application was therefore refused under  paragraph  EC-P.1.1(c)  of
    Appendix FM on the Immigration Rules S-EC.1.5.

 5. It was further noted that the appellant's sponsor was not  exempt  from
    the  financial  requirements  and  therefore  must  provide   documents
    specified in the Immigration Rules and it was noted that a P60  and  26
    pay slips were received.  Also received was a  contract  of  employment
    with Harringay Meat Traders and  a  letter  from  the  employer.   Bank
    statements were also received.

 6. However, the respondent found that the total income represented in  the
    pay slips amounted to an annual income of �18,560 which was  below  the
    �18,600 set by the Immigration Rules.

 7. The judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hussain allowed the appeal on  the
    basis that first it was for the respondent to prove the  allegation  of
    fact with regard to her immigration history  and  admission  after  the
    respondent had raised the fact which showed that  the  refusal  of  the
    appellant was conducive to the public good.  At paragraph 12 the  judge
    stated that the records had  not  been  produced  in  the  respondent's
    bundle and at paragraph 13 in the absence of evidence or  an  admission
    from the appellant  found  that  the  respondent  had  not  proven  the
    allegation.  He also found there was a high threshold  in  relation  to
    paragraph S-EC1.5 in terms of conduct amounting not to being  conducive
    to the public good and was not satisfied that the  appellant  fell  for
    exclusion under S-EC1.5.

 8. At paragraphs 16 to 19 the judge found that with regards to the  second
    grounds of refusal the ECO calculated that the sponsor's  gross  income
    came to �18,560 rather than �19,200 claimed by the sponsor.

 9. The judge noted at paragraph 17 that the respondent erred  in  assuming
    that by the date of the application the  sponsor  should  already  have
    earned the equivalent of �18,600 per year.  His reading was that at the
    date of application it must be demonstrated that the sponsor was on  an
    annual income of at least �18,600 and  this  income  was  proved  in  a
    number of ways.  First from a  letter  from  the  employer  dated  27th
    November 2012 stated that from 2nd July 2012 the sponsor had been on  a
    gross annual income of �19,240 and that was  consistent  with  the  pay
    slips issued post 2nd July 2012.   There  were  deposits  entering  the
    sponsor's account that corresponded with the net amount  shown  on  his
    pay slips.

10. At the sponsor's bundle at page 21 there was a P60 for the year  ending
    5th April 2013 that showed a gross earning of �19,290.

11. The judge concluded that at the date of the appellant the  sponsor  was
    on an annual salary of over �18,600.

Application for Permission to Appeal

12. An application for permission to appeal  was  made  by  the  respondent
    stating that the Rules for the requirement of  the  specified  evidence
    were  comprehensively  set  out  in  Appendix  FM  and  FM-SE  to   the
    Immigration Rules.  These set out what types of evidence were required,
    the periods they covered and the format they should be in.

13. It was submitted that the Tribunal had not at paragraph 17 to 20 of the
    determination had full regard to these requirements.  In this case  the
    Tribunal has made findings on evidence from July 2012.  However,  given
    that the requirements were that the evidence  needed  to  be  from  six
    months prior to the date of application the evidence considered  should
    have been from April 2012  Appendix  FM-SE  made  it  clear  that  this
    requirement was mandatory.

14. It was respectfully submitted that the evidence was  either  incomplete
    of the findings or insufficient to mean that this  appeal  should  have
    been allowed.

The Hearing

15. At the hearing before me Mrs Vidyadharan confirmed that the application
    was made on 20th September 2012 but the decision made on  6th  December
    2012.  The Rules clearly stated what documents needed to  be  submitted
    and  that  included  pay  slips  six  months  prior  to  the  date   of
    application.  The judge had not referred to this in the paragraph 17 to
    20.  He needed to look at pay slips  and  further  a  letter  from  the
    employer.  The judge was relying on evidence  that  should  not  comply
    with the Rules and was a clear error.

16. Mr Lot submitted that it was unfortunate that the judge did  not  refer
    to all the evidence but  it  was  clear  that  documentation  had  been
    submitted from 6th April 2012 and this was the basis of thirteen weeks'
    pay slips of �350 gross and after 13th July 2012 to 28  September  2012
    there was an increase in salary and this increase was to �370  and  the
    gross for this period of thirteen  weeks  was  �4,810  and  there  were
    payslips for this period.

17. There was an email from the Entry Clearance Officer dated 26th November
    2012 requesting further information and this prompted a letter from the
    employer dated 27th November 2012.  This letter was written in response
    to the email and was taken into account as part of the application.

18. The letter from the employer and the pay slips both complied  with  the
    evidence.

19. Mrs Vidyadharan submitted that the letter should have confirmed  income
    at a higher level from the original period.

20. Mr Lot stated that the covering letter of the  application  dated  28th
    September  2012  listed  all  the  documentation  that  went  with  the
    application and the Entry Clearance Officer had  referred  to  the  pay
    slips.  Furthermore there were bank statements which were submitted and
    these showed the income.

21. The Entry Clearance Officer and the Entry Clearance  Manager  had  made
    errors in their calculation and had not returned the  documentation  or
    submitted the bundle.

22. Mr Lot produced the pay slips which had been produced at the First-tier
    Tribunal which indicated a weekly salary prior to 2nd July and post 2nd
    July.  Prior to 2nd July it was �350 and post 2nd  July  was  �370  per
    week.

23. Mrs Vidyadharan agreed that the Entry  Clearance  Officer  appeared  to
    dispute one particular aspect of the evidence produced by the appellant
    and this was in relation to the gross  income  although  she  submitted
    that I had to be satisfied that all  the  Immigration  Rules  had  been
    satisfied.

24. Mr Lot took the Home Office Presenting Officer and me through  all  the
    payments identified on  the  appellant's  bank  statements  which  were
    before the Entry Clearance Officer up to 7th September 2012.

Conclusions

25. No challenge was made in the  permission  to  appeal  with  regard  the
    suitability requirements.  The issue in dispute was that of the  income
    of the sponsor and the evidence provided.  An email  was  sent  to  the
    appellant requesting further information on 26th November 2012 and thus
    although the application was  made  on  20th  September  2012  the  ECO
    clearly took into account further evidence as at 26th November 2012.

26. With regard eligibility for entry clearance as a partner the rule at E-
    ECP.3.1. stated that the applicant must provide specified evidence from
    the sources listed in paragraph E-ECP 3.2. of

    (a) a specified gross annual income of at least

           i) �18,600

27. I note from the Entry Clearance Officer's decision that  the  appellant
    was not exempt from the financial requirements as defined by  paragraph
    E-ECP.3.3. and that she must provide the documents as specified in  the
    Immigration Rules at Appendix FM-SE.

28. The Home Office Presenting Officer Mrs Vidyadharan supplied me  with  a
    copy of the Immigration Rules which were in force currently.  The rules
    as at the date of the decision varied slightly and these stated at  FM-
    SE2 the following:

         "In  respect  of  salaried  employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
         paragraph 9  applies),  all  of  the  following  evidence  must  be
         provided:

         (b)  The P60 for the relevant period or period of employment relied
         on (if issued)

         (c)  Pay slips covering:

             (i)  a period of 6 months prior to the date of application  if
                  the person has been employed by their current employer for
                  at least 6 months  (and  where  paragraph  13(b)  of  this
                  appendix does not apply); or

             (ii) any period of salaried employment in  the  period  of  12
                  months prior to the date of application if the person  has
                  been employed by their current employer for  less  than  6
                  months

         (d)  A letter from the employer(s) who  issued  the  pay  slips  at
             paragraph 2(a) confirming:

              (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;

             (ii) the length of their employment;

             (iii)    the period over which they have been or were paid the
                  level of salary relied on in the application; and

             (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or
                  agency).

         (f)  Monthly Personal bank statements  corresponding  to  the  same
             period as the pay slips at paragraph 2(a),  showing  that  the
             salary has been paid into an account in the name of the person
             or the   name  of  the  person  and  their  partner  jointly".



29. The Entry Clearance Officer went through  the  documents  provided  and
    stated that the sponsor had submitted a P60.

30. The Entry Clearance Officer also stated 'your sponsor has submitted  26
    pay slips dated from 6th April 2012 to 28th September 2012 to  evidence
    his employment with Harringay Meat Traders Limited.   The  total  gross
    salary demonstrated by these pay slips amounted to  �9,820  (equivalent
    to �18,560 per annum)'.  This was, in fact, an incorrect calculation as
    pointed out by the Entry Clearance Manager.

31. There was an email from the Entry Clearance Officer dated 26th November
    2012 requesting further information and this prompted a letter from the
    employer dated 27th November 2012.  This letter was written in response
    to the email and was taken into account as  part  of  the  application.
    The Entry Clearance Officer then  referred  to  the  requirements  with
    regards to the letter from the sponsor at paragraph 2(b)  (i)  to  (iv)
    and stated:

         "Your sponsor has submitted a letter from  Harringay  Meat  Traders
         Limited dated 27th November  2012  signed  by  Christiana  Demetrou
         stating that your sponsor has been employed as a  permanent  driver
         since 26th August 2008 with a current salary of �19,240  per  annum
         since 2nd July 2012".

32. The Entry Clearance Officer also stated that  'an  employment  contract
    had been submitted by your spouse with Harringay Meat  Traders  Limited
    dated 26th August 2008 signed ...'

33. The Entry Clearance Officer also stated 'your sponsor has  submitted  a
    Barclays Bank statement Account No XXXX9583 for the period  24th  March
    2012 to 11th September 2012.  Net pay on weekly wage  slips  correspond
    to salary deposits seen on bank statements'.

34. The Entry Clearance Officer went on to state 'your sponsor has declared
    a gross income from his employment as a driver is  �19,200  per  annum.
    Although he had stated his sponsor's total income amounted  to  �19,200
    he relied on the income  based  on  the  evidence  submitted  and  this
    evidence showed that the gross income his sponsor received in  the  six
    months prior to the date of application of �18,560 was insufficient  to
    meet the financial requirements and the application was  refused  under
    paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules'.

35. It is clear that the point taken by the Entry Clearance Officer was  in
    relation  to  the  gross   income.    The   Entry   Clearance   Officer
    miscalculated the figures and an Entry Clearance Manager  stated  in  a
    review that the actual total was  �9,280  which  doubled  was  �18,560.
    This was �40 short  of the requirement.  It was on this point that  the
    appellant demonstrated that his application met the requirement of  the
    Rules.

36. Before me Mr Lot carefully trawled through the bank statements produced
    to the Entry Clearance Officer and before the judge.  (Pausing there, I
    note that the ECO took  into  account  into  the  application  evidence
    provided as at 26th November 2012  and  this  dates  the  application).
    Thirteen payments at �350 equated to �4,550 between 10th April 2012 and
    29th June 2012 and there  were  the  equivalent  of  thirteen  payments
    between 6th July 2012 and 28th September 2012 at the rate of  �370  per
    week which equated to �4,810.  This amounts to �18,720  which  is  �120
    over the required level.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  specifically
    referred to the payment of 28th September in the notice of decision and
    which equated in the bank statement to three  payments  from  Harringay
    Meat Traders.  All of the transfers to  the  sponsor's  bank  statement
    were identified as being from  Harringay  Meat  Traders.  Thus  to  the
    period of the  application  the  sum  of  �9,360  was  demonstrated  in
    evidence or could be deduced in evidence by the judge.

37. As pointed out the Entry Clearance Officer  stated  in  his  notice  of
    refusal that 26 pay slips had been produced.  He made  no  query  about
    the remainder of the documentation produced.  Despite  a  direction  to
    produce evidence on which it was relied  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    clearly accepted that 26 pay slips had been provided albeit that  there
    was an error made by the judge in that he did not note within paragraph
    17 that those pay slips had indeed been provided.  Not  only  were  pay
    slips  provided  but  also   bank   statements   were   provided   with
    corresponding entries from the pay slips.

38. Mr Lot produced a pay slip from prior to 2nd July 2012 and a  pay  slip
    post 2nd July 2012 when the appellant would be paid �350 per week and a
    pay slip post 2012 when the appellant would be paid  �370 per week.

39. It was unfortunate that the Entry Clearance Officer made  an  error  in
    his calculations and failed to  return  the  pay  slips  in  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's bundle.  It would appear that the sponsor submitted
    a Barclays Bank statement for  the  period  24th  March  2012  to  11th
    September 2012.  In fact the statement  was  to  27th  September  2012.
    Thus there was one bank statement missing from the series to  show  the
    payment on the 28th September 2012. No issue was taken with respect  to
    the bank statements and indeed this is precisely the  area  covered  by
    the rules in force at the time.  As further information  was  requested
    by an email which is to the credit of the ECO.   Indeed  the  ECO  took
    into account evidence of the payslip of 28th September 2012.  No  issue
    was taken at the First-Tier Tribunal about the bank statements covering
    the relative period but even if this were wrong I find that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer should have requested one missing bank  statement  in
    the series. He had referred to a payslip at the end of the series. Thus
    one payslip outside the bank statement period could  have  easily  been
    rectified by requesting the missing bank statement and indeed  was  not
    the focus of the  challenge.  There  was  no  issue  with  regards  the
    authenticity of the documents.

40. The Entry Clearance Officer had clearly miscalculated the  amount  with
    respect to the payslips.  The payslips originals were according to  the
    sponsor were in Vietnam.  There was no challenge to their  authenticity
    in the decision notice.  The Entry Clearance Officer had not sent  them
    in the bundle and thus the best evidence of payslips from March to 28th
    September were in fact the bank statements and these showed  an  amount
    which exceeded the  amount  required  and  were  clearly  entries  from
    Horsemeat Trading.

41. The appellant had produced bank statements to the ECO (24th March  2012
    to 11th September 2012) to show and substantiate the  pay  slips  which
    had been submitted to the Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  these  showed
    thirteen payments at the equivalent of gross �350 per week between 10th
    April and 29th June and thirteen payments at �370 per week between  6th
    July and 28th September 2012.

42. The judge should not have referred to  evidence  which  post-dated  the
    decision because this was irrelevant  and  does  not  comply  with  the
    rules.  However on the basis of the evidence which was before the judge
    and before the ECO I find that the  appellant  could  comply  with  the
    rules and therefore the error by the judge was not material.

43. As this was the point that was taken by the Entry Clearance Officer and
    bearing in mind the confusion raised by the Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    notice and the subsequent review I conclude  that  although  the  judge
    might have been more  expansive  in  his  reasoning  with  regards  the
    evidence submitted by the appellant overall with  the  application,  at
    the date the appellant had, on balance, produce evidence to show he was
    in receipt of �18,600 per annum.  I find that the appellant  must  show
    that he has been in receipt of the equivalent of �18,600 per annum  for
    at least six months prior to the application but the appellant could in
    fact show this and had produced the evidence.  There was  an  error  in
    the judge's failure to consider evidence which  postdate  the  decision
    but on a complete reading  of  the  determination  and  further  to  my
    reasoning above, I find no material error in his decision and find that
    the determination shall stand.
