Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Chelvan, instructed by KTS Legal Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   Although the appellant and the respondent are as set out  above  before
    me, it will be convenient to refer to them  as  they  were  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge so I shall hereafter refer to Mrs Sivakokilan
    as the appellant and the Entry Clearance Officer as the respondent.

2.   The appellant sought entry clearance to settle in  the  United  Kingdom
    with her husband, the sponsor, as his wife.  As regards  the  sponsor's
    ability to maintain the appellant, the respondent noted that he  needed
    a gross income of at least �18,600 per annum.  He had provided a letter
    from Tesco Stores Limited where he worked as a customer assistant,  and
    the respondent had a concern  that  this  letter  from  Tesco  did  not
    confirm his gross annual salary, type and length of employment  or  the
    period over which he had been paid the level of salary relied  upon  in
    the application.

3.   The respondent  also  noted  the  claim  that  the  sponsor  was  self-
    employed, running a newspaper and a  magazine  delivery  service.   The
    relevant provisions of paragraph 7 of FM-SE  were  noted,  and  it  was
    commented  that  contracts  with  2TheDoor  and  S  Rajkumar  were  not
    consistent  with  the  payment  breakdown  provided  by  the  sponsor's
    accountant or his accounts and as a consequence the respondent was  not
    satisfied that the accounts provided were accurate representations   of
    the sponsor's earnings from this employment.  Also, he had not provided
    an annual  self-assessment  tax  return  or  statement  of  account  as
    required in the Immigration Rules.  Bank statements from  NatWest  Bank
    provided were not accepted as evidence  of  the  sponsor's  ability  to
    support her within the terms of FM-SE in the absence of  the  sponsor's
    annual tax return.  In  the  absence  of  specified  documents  of  his
    employment or self-employment the respondent was  unable  to  calculate
    his income within the terms of paragraph of FM-SE and was therefore not
    satisfied that either the appellant or  the  sponsor  had  demonstrated
    that they held  sufficient  funds  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

4.   As regards accommodation, it was considered that the evidence  provided
    was not satisfactory to establish the current occupancy or confirmation
    that  the  property  was  sufficiently  spacious  to  accommodate   the
    appellant and the sponsor within the terms of UK housing legislation.

5.   Consideration was given to Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights, and it was concluded, in effect,  that  its  requirements
    were not met in this case.

6.   The judge considered first the issue of accommodation which I can  deal
    with in short order since her findings in  that  regard  were  not  the
    subject of  later  challenge.   She  had  seen  relevant  documentation
    including mortgage documentation, utility bills,  an  insurance  policy
    and sale particulars of the property when purchased by the sponsor  and
    were satisfied that the accommodation was adequate for the purposes  of
    the Rules.

7.   As regards the issue of maintenance, the judge was satisfied  that  the
    sponsor  had  provided  sufficient  documentation  to  establish   both
    employments.  The contract of employment with Tesco showed that he  had
    been working for them since 22 October 2011, his contracted hours  were
    22.50 per week and his rate of pay was �159.15 per  week  according  to
    his payslips and he had also done overtime.  The contract of employment
    was  in  the  respondent's  bundle.   The  judge  commented  that   the
    respondent would appear to have missed that document and had reached an
    adverse  conclusion about the Tesco employment without considering  it.



8.    As  regards  the  self-employment,  the  judge  again  considered  the
    documentation provided was sufficient to establish it.  The sponsor had
    paid his Class 2 NIC (payment receipts seen).   He  had  a  UTR  number
    given by HMRC.  HMRCs' tax calculations showed that he had declared his
    earnings to them and was paying his income tax.  The judge saw  nothing
    untoward in the profit and loss accounts and balance sheets prepared by
    the sponsor's accountants and they had been accepted by HMRC.   On  the
    basis of the evidence including witness statements and letters from the
    sponsor's clients,  she was satisfied that the sponsor was trading  and
    that the business was profitable.

9.   She went on to note the evidence from HMRC which  showed  his  earnings
    from the two forms of employment including showing  that  in  2012/2013
    his earnings from paid employment of �12,123 and the profit from  self-
    employment was �17,866.  For 2013/2014 his gross employment from  Tesco
    amounted to �12,678 and the profit from  self-employment  was  �15,834.
    Accordingly she was satisfied that the requirements of the  Rules  were
    met.

10.  As regards Article 8, in the circumstances she  saw  no  need  to  deal
    with it and in  any  event  Counsel  for  the  appellant  had  made  no
    submissions on Article 8  and  accordingly  she  assumed  that  it  was
    therefore decided not to pursue that issue.

11.  The respondent sought and was  granted  permission  to  appeal  on  the
    basis that the judge had not had  regard  to  the  Rules  of  specified
    evidence set out in Appendix FM-SE and the decision  failed  to  comply
    with the Immigration Rules.  The point was taken that the Tesco  letter
    did not confirm the sponsor's gross annual salary type  and  length  of
    employment or the period over which he  had  been  paid  the  level  of
    salary relied upon in the application.  Some of these issues  had  been
    addressed in the contract of employment but the  judge  had  not  dealt
    with all of them in coming to her findings.

12.  The inconsistency referred  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in  the
    evidence from the contracts and the  accounts  provided  had  not  been
    engaged with fully by the judge.  The sponsor had not  provided  annual
    self-assessment tax returns or statement  of  account  and  these  were
    documents which were specified in the Immigration Rules and required to
    be provided.   It  was  also  unclear  whether  the  Tribunal  had  had
    appropriate  regard  to  the  relevant  date.   For  Appendix  FM   the
    significant date was the  date  of  application,  and  the  significant
    evidence was from the  specified  period  before  that  date.   It  was
    therefore not clear what the sponsor's actual gross income was  at  the
    date of application.

13.  Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that  it  was  argued  in
    the grounds that the judge had erred in her approach to Article  8  and
    her assessment of whether the appellant and the  sponsor  met  Appendix
    FM.  It was said that it was not clear  what  factors  weighed  in  the
    judge's mind when she decided there were exceptional  features  of  the
    case which justified allowing the appeal and the lack of reasoning  was
    an arguable error of law.  It was said that given the Tribunal decision
    in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640,  it  was  arguable  that  the  judge  had
    misdirected herself as to the law on Article 8.

14.   In  her  submissions  Ms  Isherwood  argued  that  the   determination
    contained material  errors  of  law.   It  was  clear  from  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager's review that the Tesco contact had been  considered,
    at paragraph 6. It was  argued  that  Mr  Chelvan's  response  did  not
    address the grounds.  There were points in the ECO's refusal which  the
    judge had not addressed.  It was not enough just to argue that that was
    not a PBS case.  Appendix FM  was relevant with regard to the  evidence
    required prior to the application.  The judge had not dealt with  these
    points.  Paragraph 15 of the determination was insufficient.  Paragraph
    16 likewise.  The further evidence from the accountants was not enough.



15.  In his submissions Mr Chelvan said that as there was no note  from  the
    Presenting Officer or Counsel who had appeared on behalf of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer.  He had obtained the statement which was attached to
    his response, from Counsel, Mr Davison, at the hearing before the First-
    tier Judge.  Ms Isherwood now disagreed as to how the hearing had  been
    conducted before the judge.  The points she raised were not dealt  with
    because the Entry  Clearance  Officer's  Counsel  and  the  appellant's
    Counsel and the judge  had  narrowed  the  issues.   Ms  Isherwood  was
    seeking to have a second bite at the cherry.  There had been  a  change
    in the Entry Clearance Officer's strategy before the Tribunal.

16.  Miss Isherwood said she had not realised there  would  be  a  statement
    from Counsel, Mr Davison.

17.  Mr Chelvan referred to paragraph 5 of his  skeleton.  This  was  not  a
    section 85A appeal.  Counsel had conceded that, and that  key  document
    was now before the Tribunal.  Sufficient funds were the only issue.

18.  There was a procedural point.  There was reference to Article 8 in  the
    grant. It was the case that the documents had been provided in  effect.
    The Gulshan  point was odd.   There  was  a  need  to  take  care  when
    granting permission as there was no Article 8 issue in fact in the case
    at that stage.  The  case  had  shifted,  as  could  be  seen  from  Mr
    Davison's note, from the Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  to  the
    simple issue of whether the sponsor could show �18,600.  the  case  had
    changed and there had been a concession.  The date of decision  was  20
    April 2014.  Thus it could  be seen from page 66 of the bundle that the
    tax calculation for 2012/2013 was a total of just under  �30,000.   The
    appeal did not consider the  concession made by Counsel  on  behalf  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer.

19.  If the matter was split  between  the  Immigration  Rules  and  primary
    legislation then clearly the latter won  and  page  5  note  5  of  the
    skeleton referred to this.  The Secretary of State  accepted  that  the
    legislation would win the day.  The judge had accepted that  the  issue
    was that of the facts at the date of decision or  appertaining  to  it.
    It was a standard entry clearance appeal and it was not a PBS case,  as
    Counsel had accepted.

20.  The documents which proved the income threshold were  provided  to  the
    judge.  They  were  there  in  compliance  with  Appendix  FM-SE.   The
    question was whether one needed to be fixiated on the approach  to  say
    the appellant could not attend  the  hearing  and  provide  a  document
    missing at the date of application to show the rule was  met  and  that
    was the issue.  The Presenting Officer sought to strike out Exception 1
    as referred to in the grounds, and that could not be done.

21.  In the response it was argued that this was  a  section  82(2)(b)  case
    and concerned the circumstances at the time of decision.  This  was  in
    contrast to Exception 2 which referred to documents at the time of  the
    application.  The Presenting Officer had properly conceded it was not a
    PBS case so it must be Exception 1 and therefore the relevant date  was
    the date of decision, in April 2013.  The documents at pages 85 and  86
    proved the case.  It was surprising that  the  Tribunal  was  asked  to
    dismiss the appeal when the requirements of the rule had been met.   Ms
    Isherwood was seeking a complete restructuring of the appeal  and  said
    it was not possible to bring documents to the hearing.   There  was  no
    authority for this.

22.  There was no challenge to  the  accommodation  point  and  whether  the
    judge had found the threshold was met.  It could not be  disputed  that
    it was met at the date of decision and the Presenting Officer  did  not
    argue that it had not been.   The Tribunal  had  the  two  tax  returns
    which clearly set out the documents the appellant relied on.  Paragraph
    19 of  the  response  set  out  the  relevant  legal  provisions.   The
    legislation had priority and it was a question of the facts at the date
    of decision.  Section 85A was pending amendment but as it stood it must
    be considered.  A purposive approach to the Rule was to be adopted.  Ms
    Isherwood did not say that Appendix FM  was not satisfied but  Appendix
    FM-SE was not, she said.  According to section 12 of the 2007  Act  the
    challenge could only succeed if there were an error of law at the  time
    of the hearing.  In light of the concession it had come down to the two
    documents.

23.  By way of reply Ms Isherwood argued that Mr Chelvan had  misinterpreted
    her.  She did not say that PBS trapped this.  She was aware of what was
    said at paragraph 5 in Mr Chelvan's skeleton, but it was not  so  clear
    about the key documents.  Ms Isherwood argued that the  judge  had  not
    dealt with the precise point of the conflict in the  evidence  referred
    to by the Entry Clearance Officer and that had never  been   addressed.
    Even in the grounds at paragraph 7 one could  make a fresh  application
    and Appendix FM  set out what the required evidence and  periods  were.
    Account had been  taken of the accountant's report up to March 2014 but
    it was irrelevant to the applications.

24.  Mr Chelvan made the  point  that  the  appellant  relied  on  the  HMRC
    documents, not the accountant's letter.  January 2013 was the  date  of
    application and that could be found at page 66 of the bundle.  The HMRC
    documentation was dispositive, as the Presenting Officer at the hearing
    had agreed.

25.  Ms Isherwood made the final point that the date of application  was  29
    January 2013 so it was in relation to evidence up to then.

26.  I reserved my determination.

27.  I have set out above in some detail the basis upon  which  the  refusal
    was made by the Entry Clearance Officer.  It is  necessary  to  examine
    these concerns point by point.  The first point is that the letter from
    Tesco did not confirm the sponsor's  gross  annual  salary,  title  and
    length of employment nor the period over which he  had  been  paid  the
    level of salary relied upon in the application.  The letter from  Tesco
    dated 10 January 2013 confirms that the sponsor has  been  employed  by
    them since 22 October 2011, describes the nature of his  work  and  the
    fact that he is a permanent employee of Tesco.  There is  no  reference
    to his gross annual salary nor indeed to his wages at  all.   There  is
    also provided a contact from Tesco which set out  his  core  contracted
    hours of 22.50 a week and his total rate of pay as  �159.15  per  week.
    However the  mandatory  requirement  of  Appendix  FM-SE  at  paragraph
    2(b)(i) is not met since the gross annual salary is not set out  there.
    Otherwise the requirements of the Rules concerning what such  a  letter
    should contain appear to be present.

28.  The next issue that concerned the respondent was  with  regard  to  the
    sponsor's  self-  employment.   This  self-employment,  it  seems,   is
    concerned with work he does as  a subcontractor for a Mr S Rajkumar and
    also a Mr T Ganeshapillai who both have contracts with the organisation
    known as 2TheDoor to deliver newspapers from  their  Barking  premises.
    There is a letter from Mr Rajkumar confirming that the sponsor has been
    working for the Morning Courier which is a company under which name  he
    trades, since 24 March 2012, and there is a fairly similar letter  from
    Mr Ganeshapillai confirming that the sponsor  has  been  working  as  a
    subcontractor for 2TheDoor since 2 June 2012.

29.  Of course it matters little that  the  starting  dates  for  these  two
    subcontractors are  different.  The  matter  that  troubled  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was that the payments in the  sponsor's  accountant's
    accounts show that payments began on 20 January 2012.  Those  payments,
    however, were part of his  salary,  and  there  no  indication  in  the
    breakdown for earnings in Suryia and Co's letter of 10 January 2013  as
    to the dates on which the particular earnings of self  employment  were
    obtained, although it is said to be from a period of 15 April  2012  to
    31 December 2012, which in my view essentially conforms to what is said
    in the subcontracts as to the start date of these contracts.  The  fact
    that one of those subcontracts began in March and  the  other  in  June
    does not preclude payments coming in as from 15 April.

30.  Otherwise the main concern of the Entry Clearance Officer was that  the
    appellant had  not  provided  annual  self-assessment  tax  returns  or
    statements for account and that matter was rectified at the hearing.

31.  I think it is uncontroversial that, as contended for  in  Mr  Chelvan's
    skeleton, this an Exception 1 rather than an Exception 2 case, since it
    is not a PBS case, and therefore the issue is as to  the  circumstances
    appertaining at the time for decision.  The only point missing from the
    documentation is an explicit statement of the  sponsor's  gross  annual
    salary, but that can readily be gleaned from  the  employment  contract
    which sets out  his weekly rate of pay  and  I  consider  it  would  be
    taking the requirements to conform to  specific  Rules  excessively  to
    require the sum multiplying that by 52 to have been   set  out  in  the
    letter.

32.  Accordingly, although the judge did not address matters in the kind  of
    detail with which I think she should have done, the conclusion that she
    came to was one which was properly open to her in light of the evidence
    and accordingly her decision allowing this appeal is maintained.
