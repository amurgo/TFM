Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
No anonymity order was made by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I  find  that  no
particular issues arise on the facts of this case  that  give  rise  to  the
need for a direction. For this reason no anonymity direction is made.

                            DECISION AND REASONS
Background

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  For ease of reference,
       I refer below to the parties as they were in the First-Tier Tribunal
       albeit that the Secretary of State is technically the  Appellant  in
       this particular appeal.


    2. The Appellant is a citizen of Slovakia.   She  appeals  against  the
       Respondent's decision dated 20 August 2014  to  make  a  deportation
       order against her under Regulations 19 and  21  of  The  Immigration
       (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the  EEA  Regulations").
       The deportation order was made on 8 September 2014.

    3. The Appellant was convicted on 4 November 2011  at  Maidstone  Crown
       Court of one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and two  counts  of
       money laundering and was sentenced to 54  months'  imprisonment.   A
       confiscation order was made against her and, due  to  non-compliance
       with that order, she served a further  16  months  in  prison.   The
       Appellant's accomplices  in  this  fraudulent  enterprise  were  her
       husband and brother.  Their appeals against deportation  have  since
       been  dismissed  and  her  brother  has  already  been  deported  to
       Slovakia.

    4. The Appellant is said to have been the organiser of the fraud  which
       is reflected in the longer sentence which she was given.  The  fraud
       was against the public purse consisting of  benefit  fraud  (working
       tax credit, child tax credit and child allowance)  running  to  over
       �600,000.  The  conspiracy  involved  bringing  approximately  fifty
       Slovakian women to the UK and giving them false  national  insurance
       numbers.  The Appellant and her accomplices  then  took  control  of
       their bank accounts and reaped  the  benefit  of  the  public  funds
       thereby obtained.  The offences included money laundering. The money
       obtained from this enterprise has not been recovered and is  thought
       to be in Slovakia.  The Appellant and her  accomplices  pleaded  not
       guilty and  the  Appellant  has  never  admitted  responsibility  or
       remorse for her crime.

    5. At one point in time, the Appellant applied to  return  to  Slovakia
       under the Early Release Scheme but then changed her  mind  when  the
       deportation decision was taken and she appealed the  decision.   Her
       appeal was allowed by  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Tipping  (albeit
       "with reluctance") in a decision promulgated on 18  May  2015  ("the
       Decision").  He found, based mainly it seems on  the  conclusion  of
       the OASyS report, that the Appellant did  not  represent  a  genuine
       present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
       fundamental interests of society.

    6. The Respondent sought permission to  appeal  on  two  grounds.   The
       first relates to the Judge's finding that the Appellant could not be
       deported solely on the basis  of  the  offence  for  which  she  was
       convicted and imprisoned.  It is said that this finding is perverse.
        Secondly, it is asserted that the Judge's finding that her  conduct
       could not amount to a sufficiently serious threat because there  was
       no evidence that  other  benefit  claimants  had  been  deprived  of
       benefits was also perverse (as was measurement of the scale  of  the
       fraud by reference  to  the  overall  UK  gross  domestic  product).
       Before me, Mr Melvin sought to add to those grounds and I will  deal
       with that under the heading of "Submissions" below.

    7. Permission to appeal the Decision was granted by First-Tier Tribunal
       Judge Grant-Hutchinson on 5 June 2015 on the basis  that  the  Judge
       had arguably  misdirected  himself  in  his  interpretation  of  the
       Appellant's conduct as not representing the requisite threat by  not
       taking account of  the  scale  of  the  conspiracy  and  the  amount
       involved.   The matter comes before the Upper Tribunal to  determine
       whether the First-tier Tribunal Decision involved the making  of  an
       error of law.

Submissions

    8. Mr Melvin fairly accepted that the  Presenting  Officer  before  the
       First-Tier Tribunal  submitted  that  the  decision  to  deport  was
       justified only by the scale of the fraud  and  that  the  Judge  may
       therefore have been misled into ignoring the basis of  the  decision
       as set out in the deportation letter which noted not only the  scale
       of the fraud but also the  wider  implications  of  fraud  involving
       money laundering due to the potential  destination  of  such  funds.
       The decision to deport was therefore based not only on the impact of
       the fraud on the public purse by depriving the Exchequer  of  public
       funds but also on the impact of money laundering given the potential
       funding by that means of  drug  dealers,  terrorists,  illegal  arms
       dealers and others and the enabling of  their  criminal  enterprise.
       The Judge may, by  the  submissions  made,  have  misunderstood  the
       Respondent's case as being based solely on the offence for which the
       Appellant was convicted.  In any event, however, Mr Melvin submitted
       that there was no legal authority for the proposition  that  an  EEA
       country could not remove an EEA national for conduct based  only  on
       the offence for which that person was convicted.


    9. In relation to the second ground, Mr Melvin drew attention  to  [11]
       and [12] of the Decision which  included  reference  to  no  benefit
       claimants having been deprived of benefits.  He submitted that  this
       was not relevant to the issues which the Judge had to determine.  In
       relation to the future threat,  Mr  Melvin  referred  to  the  OASys
       report and submitted that the Judge had erred in taking into account
       only the conclusion of that report and had failed  to  consider  the
       substance of it.  Mr Melvin pointed in particular in the  report  to
       the Appellant's refusal to take responsibility for  the  crimes  she
       had committed and to show any remorse or appreciation of the  impact
       of the crimes.  The fraud was used to fund an extravagant  lifestyle
       for the Appellant  and  her  co-conspirators  including  a  gambling
       habit.  There was no evidence  that  the  Appellant  had  undertaken
       courses whilst in prison to deal with her behaviours. There  was  no
       indication that the circumstances which led the Appellant and her co-
       conspirators to commit the offence had altered and the  Judge  erred
       in failing to take those matters into account.  The Judge  abdicated
       responsibility  of  deciding  for  himself  whether  the   Appellant
       represented a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat.


   10. Mr Melvin also  sought  permission  to  argue  further  grounds.   I
       allowed him to do so without reaching a decision  as  to  whether  I
       would take them into account.  He submitted that the Judge had  also
       failed to take into account the Appellant's family connections  i.e.
       the fact that her husband and brother were co-conspirators  and  the
       implications of that for the threat which she would present for  the
       future and had also failed to make any finding as to  the  level  of
       protection to which the Respondent was entitled based on her  length
       of residence.

   11. As to the latter, there was no challenge to the Respondent's finding
       in the decision letter that she benefited only from the lower  level
       of protection because there was no evidence of her exercising Treaty
       rights.  Mr Melvin confirmed that.  In any event, that  appeared  to
       follow from the fact that the conspiracy in which the Appellant  was
       involved had begun in 2005 and continued  until  her  arrest.   That
       criminal enterprise, on any view, could not amount to  the  exercise
       of Treaty rights.  This was not therefore  something  on  which  the
       Judge needed to make a finding and the Judge rightly  accepted  that
       the Appellant benefited only from the lower level of protection.

   12. In relation to the first of the two  additional  grounds,  I  accept
       that this may  be  relevant  to  the  future  threat  posed  by  the
       Appellant and I therefore take this into consideration when reaching
       my decision whether the Judge made an error of law.

   13. In  response,  the  Appellant,  who  appeared  in  person  and  made
       submissions via an interpreter, noted that she had done some courses
       whilst in prison and had eight certificates as a result.  Those  are
       contained in the bail file and are  educational  courses  linked  to
       improving her English and mathematical skills and  catering  courses
       linked to her work whilst in prison.  Those may have some impact  on
       her risk of re-offending as her lack of  English  and  inability  to
       find work are identified as factors in her offending.  The Appellant
       also told me that she had been working in prison in the kitchen  and
       staff mess.   From this, I understood her  to  be  saying  that  she
       would not need to resort to  crime  as  she  may  be  able  to  find
       employment based on increased education and work experience.

   14. The  Appellant  also  indicated  that  she  no  longer  objected  to
       deportation.  She wished to stay in the UK only until  January  when
       her eldest daughter, who has  an  18  month  old  son,  reaches  her
       majority.  She did not wish to leave  her  daughter  to  cope  alone
       until she reaches adulthood.  I noted that her daughters  live  with
       her mother who no doubt could help out with which  she  agreed.  She
       also indicated that she was making an application for a passport  to
       the Slovakian Embassy so that her children could  return  with  her.
       Her younger daughter is aged fifteen. The Appellant presented me and
       Mr Melvin with a letter indicating that she was willing to return to
       Slovakia if my decision were adverse to her (although would stay  if
       it were not) but she wished to be allowed to depart  voluntarily  if
       she was to return rather than via detention.  Mr Melvin pointed  out
       that the Appellant has given similar indications in the past and has
       changed her mind.  In any event, as I explained  to  the  Appellant,
       the mechanics of deportation assuming I were to decide against  her,
       are a matter for the Home Office and she would need to discuss  this
       directly  with  the  Home  Office.   It  is  not  relevant   to   my
       consideration but I place it on record.


    Error of law decision


   15. Having considered the grounds of appeal and oral submissions,  I  am
       satisfied that the First-Tier Tribunal Decision involved the  making
       of an error of law.  It was for the  Judge  to  decide  whether  the
       Appellant is a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat.
       Whilst the conclusion of the OASys report is a consideration in that
       assessment and generally a weighty one, it is not the start and  end
       point as the Judge seems to have thought.  Indeed the Judge notes at
       [11] of the Decision, that  it is not clear why  the  conclusion  of
       the OASys report is reached but then fails to review  the  substance
       of that report for himself.


   16. The Judge also erred in misunderstanding the threat to public  order
       and public security of the Appellant's crimes in relation  to  money
       laundering at [11].  The fact that money laundering in  the  context
       of this crime was not directed to drugs or  arms  running  does  not
       mean that the funds generated from these crimes when laundered might
       not have ended up being used for that purpose.  It  is  an  integral
       part of the crime of money laundering that the  end  destination  of
       funds is not the same as the source of those funds. The  Judge  also
       erred in taking into account when  considering  whether  there  were
       grounds of public policy and public security  for  deportation  that
       individual benefit claimants had not been impacted by the fraud, the
       scale of the fraud when compared with the overall GDP of the UK  and
       that there was no violence  or drug  peddling  involved.   The  fact
       that the public resources of the UK have been depleted by over  �0.5
       million as a result of the Appellant's crimes (which  has  not  been
       recovered)  is  clearly  capable  of  justifying   the   Appellant's
       deportation on public policy grounds alone.

   17. I indicated at the hearing that if I found an error of  law,  I  was
       minded to go on to re-make the decision based on the evidence before
       me.  The Appellant did not add to her evidence  in  submissions  and
       there is no relevant evidence which I  considered  was  required  in
       order to re-make the decision.  Mr Melvin  handed  in  the  Tribunal
       decisions in relation to the Appellant's  husband  and  brother  but
       other than that and the letter to  which  I  refer  at  [14]  above,
       neither party  sought  to  adduce  any  documentary  evidence.   The
       parties agreed that this was the appropriate course and I  therefore
       turn to re-make the decision.

    Decision and reasons


   18. The relevant provisions of the EEA Regulations are as  follows.   By
       regulation 19, the Secretary of State may exclude an EEA national if
       that is justified on grounds of public policy,  public  security  or
       public health in accordance with regulation 21.   Regulation  21  so
       far as material reads as follows:-


    "Decisions taken on public policy, public security and public health
                                   grounds


           21.-(1) In this regulation a "relevant decision"  means  an  EEA
           decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security
           or public health.


           (2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.


           (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a  person
           with a permanent right of residence under regulation  15  except
           on serious grounds of public policy or public security.


           (4) ..............


           (5) Where a relevant decision is  taken  on  grounds  of  public
           policy or public security it shall,  in  addition  to  complying
           with the preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in
           accordance with the following principles-


            (a)    the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
    proportionality;


      (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the  personal  conduct
           of the person concerned;


      (c)  the personal conduct of the person concerned  must  represent  a
           genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one
           of the fundamental interests of society;


      (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or  which
           relate to considerations of general prevention  do  not  justify
           the decision;


      (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions do  not  in  themselves
           justify the decision.


           (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds  of  public
           policy or public  security  in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
           resident in the United Kingdom  the  decision  maker  must  take
           account of considerations such as  the  age,  state  of  health,
           family and economic situation of the person, the person's length
           of residence in the United  Kingdom,  the  person's  social  and
           cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the  extent  of
           the person's links with his country of origin."

   19. The first issue with which I deal is the level of  protection  which
       the Appellant can obtain by reason of her residence.  The  Appellant
       worked for a year or two when she first  arrived  picking  fruit  in
       Kent after which she was laid off.   She  claims  to  have  been  in
       receipt of jobseekers allowance and to  have  worked  intermittently
       thereafter but there is no evidence of this.  In 2005, about a  year
       after coming to the UK, she became engaged in the criminal  activity
       for which she was ultimately convicted.  Her  enterprise  in  making
       fraudulent claims on behalf of others could not on any  view  amount
       to the exercise of Treaty rights.  The Judge who sentenced her found
       that she had never worked during the period from 2005 and  therefore
       the claims made for  working  tax  credits  in  her  own  name  were
       fraudulent.  On that basis, her residence after 2005 cannot be  said
       to be lawful. She was however resident in the  UK  from  2004  until
       November 2011 when she was convicted which  would  be  a  sufficient
       period to count as permanent  residence  if  it  were  lawful.   Her
       fraudulent enterprise during those years does not constitute  lawful
       residence but I do not discount the possibility that  she  might  be
       considered to be lawfully resident if, for example,  she  were  also
       working from time to  time  or  claiming  benefits  as  a  jobseeker
       (although I emphasise that there is a complete absence  of  evidence
       of that).  In case I am wrong about whether the period between  2005
       and 2011 were lawful, therefore, I have considered the issue of  the
       protection which applies both at the lower level and  on  the  basis
       that serious grounds are required.


   20. The scale of the conspiracy in which the Appellant was involved  was
       significant.  The Judge in his  sentencing  remarks  refers  to  152
       fraudulent claims committed over a period of five  years  from  2005
       and netting sums of over �600,000 of public money.  The Judge refers
       to the "blatant" nature of the fraud. In spite of "overwhelming  and
       extremely  incriminating"  evidence,  the  Appellant  and  her   co-
       conspirators pleaded not guilty.  As the OASyS report indicates, the
       Appellant was the organiser behind the offence.

   21. Although the offence is not one of violence or involving drugs it is
       nonetheless extremely serious, involving as it does  the  commission
       of fraud on the Exchequer and the depletion of public resources.   I
       have no difficulty in finding that  this  constitutes  a  ground  of
       public policy.  In addition, the offences included money  laundering
       and, for the reasons I give at [16] above, this raises also  grounds
       of public security.

   22. My decision must take into account not only the seriousness  of  the
       offences however but whether the Appellant poses a genuine,  present
       and sufficiently serious threat to one of the fundamental  interests
       of society.   The  Appellant's  previous  criminal  convictions  are
       relevant only in so far as the circumstances which gave rise to them
       are evidence of personal conduct constituting a  present  threat  to
       the requirements of public policy (see, to that effect, inter  alia,
       the case of Bouchereau  [1977]  ECR  1999).   I  turn  therefore  to
       consider that threat.

   23.  As noted at [15] above, the First-Tier Tribunal Judge was persuaded
       to allow the appeal based on the OASyS report dated 5 November 2014.
        The conclusion of that report is indeed  to  the  effect  that  the
       Appellant poses a low risk of harm and a low  risk  of  re-offending
       and that is a factor to which I have regard.  However, that risk  is
       measured on the basis of a series of scores which relate to a number
       of factors and the assessed risk does not therefore give a  complete
       picture. I therefore consider the substance of  that  report.   When
       considered as a whole, the report paints a different picture.

   24. The  Appellant's  motivation  is  said  to  be  an  "opportunity  to
       financially gain a luxurious  lifestyle".   Although  this  was  the
       Appellant's first conviction, the offences continued over  a  number
       of years and would no doubt have continued for longer if she and her
       co-conspirators had not been caught.  Furthermore, the OASyS  report
       shows that the  Appellant  had  been  cautioned  previously  on  one
       occasion for theft and  that  the  current  offences  represent  "an
       escalation in seriousness" and show a pattern of similar  offending.



   25. The  Appellant's  education  and  employability  is  linked  to  her
       offending behaviour.  I take into account  that  her  education  and
       work experience whilst in prison might have reduced the risk to some
       extent.  However, her offending was with her husband and brother and
       so her relationships are linked to  her  offending  behaviour.   She
       remains in a subsisting relationship with her husband  although  her
       brother has returned to Slovakia.  It  is  noted  that  "she  allies
       herself with a criminal subculture". Her offending behaviour is also
       noted to be linked to her financial situation, her lifestyle and her
       thinking,  behaviour  and  attitudes.   She  was  motivated  by  her
       "immediate greed for  money  rather  than  finding  legal  means  of
       getting finance".  There is no  evidence  that,  in  particular  her
       thinking, behaviour and attitudes have changed.  That  is  reflected
       in her failure to acknowledge or take responsibility for her crimes.
        Although she is noted to have been a model inmate whilst in prison,
       the Appellant has consistently refused to recognise the implications
       of her offending or to express any remorse for it.   Even  now,  the
       OASyS report notes that she will not discuss the offence,  takes  no
       responsibility for it and continues to deny it.


   26. The OASyS assessment notes that the Appellant is  "quite  motivated"
       to change and "very capable" of doing so.  However, in  relation  to
       inhibiting factors, it is said that the  "risk  will  increase  when
       associating with negative peers and family, language barriers, greed
       and lack of appropriate thinking skills".  The report recommends the
       development of  positive  factors  in  those  areas.   However,  the
       Appellant has undertaken no courses other than educational and  said
       at the hearing before me that she did not see the  need  to  do  any
       further courses.  It is  also  noted  that  the  Appellant  had  not
       undertaken any work  to  address  the  concern  about  her  lack  of
       awareness of impact of her offence.   Her English  remains  limited.
       There is no evidence that she is in work presently.

   27. There  is  nothing  in  the  evidence  which  I  have  seen  or  the
       submissions which I heard from  the  Appellant  which  leads  me  to
       conclude that she has changed her attitude or behaviours so that she
       would be unlikely to offend  in  the  future.   In  particular,  her
       failure to recognise the enormity of her past offending and  failure
       to show remorse even now points to a current risk that she will  re-
       offend.  Further, the Appellant's offences were motivated  by  greed
       and exacerbated by her lack of employment.  Although her educational
       courses and work experience whilst in prison may have  improved  her
       ability to gain employment to some extent, she is likely to find  it
       more  difficult  to  find  employment  following   her   conviction,
       particularly in jobs which involve handling money.  The OASyS report
       suggests that if she were to find herself in the situation of having
       no money and no legal way of obtaining it,  she  might  well  offend
       again.  The Appellant has not taken any steps towards rehabilitation
       and continues to deny the offence and refuses  to  face  up  to  the
       consequences of her action.  Given the lack  of  evidence  that  the
       Appellant is taking steps towards rehabilitating herself in the  UK,
       I am satisfied that her prospects of  rehabilitation  would  not  be
       adversely affected by return to Slovakia. On the basis of the  OASyS
       report read as a  whole,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  risk  of  the
       Appellant re-offending is significant and certainly much higher than
       the OASyS conclusion would suggest.


   28. I now turn to consider the proportionality  of  deportation  and  in
       particular the countervailing factors in the form of the Appellant's
       family in the UK.   The Appellant is married with two daughters. The
       eldest daughter will reach her majority in January.  The youngest is
       nearly 15 years old.  The eldest daughter has a son aged 18  months.
       Both daughters lived with the Appellant's mother whilst she  was  in
       prison and continue to do so now. They could continue to  do  so  if
       the Appellant is deported.  The Appellant's husband  is  due  to  be
       deported as his appeal has  failed.   The  Appellant  noted  in  her
       statement of 21 September 2014 that she wished to stay in the UK  as
       it would be unfair to her daughters to have to  return  to  Slovakia
       where they do not speak the  language,  having  grown  up,  received
       education and formed their  lives  in  the  UK.  The  Appellant  now
       indicates, however, that she  would  return  to  Slovakia  with  her
       mother, partner and daughters.  That would inevitably lead  to  some
       disruption to the lives of the Appellant's children and her  mother.
       The eldest daughter could remain in the UK if she so wished and  she
       now has, it appears, a family of  her  own.   The  younger  daughter
       could remain in the UK if she chose and if  the  Appellant's  mother
       were to decide to remain.  That is a matter of choice for them.   In
       that event, therefore, the position for the Appellant's children and
       mother would be largely the status quo as they have known it  whilst
       the Appellant was in prison.   There would  be  some  disruption  if
       they chose not to accompany the Appellant  as  they  would  have  to
       remain in contact with the Appellant (and  her  husband)  via  other
       means of communication and visits to Slovakia.


   29. There is some evidence of other family members in the UK.  As  noted
       at [3] above, the Appellant's brother has already been  deported  to
       Slovakia but she also has a sister and cousin in  the  UK  who  have
       acted as her sureties whilst she has been on bail.   However,  there
       is limited evidence of the family relationships  and  circumstances.
       Those relationships are not  therefore  a  factor  which  holds  any
       weight in the proportionality exercise.


   30. So far as the Appellant's private life is concerned,  the  Appellant
       has provided practically no evidence of integration in the UK beyond
       interaction with her direct family members and  her  involvement  in
       the offences of which she was convicted. She says  that  she  worked
       picking fruit in Kent in 2004 and 2005 and was then laid  off.   She
       claims to have worked intermittently since but there is no  evidence
       of that and it appears from the evidence that  from  2005,  she  was
       involved in the criminal activity of which she was  convicted.   The
       sentencing Judge found that she had not worked during  that  period.
       The Appellant speaks limited English.  Her  letter  to  me  which  I
       mention at [14] above, is written in English. She did  however  make
       her submissions mainly via an interpreter in Slovakian.

   31. So far as my decision under the EEA Regulations is concerned,  I  am
       satisfied that   the Appellant's removal is justified on grounds  of
       public security and public policy and that is so whether  judged  on
       the basis of reasonable grounds or serious grounds (if  I  am  wrong
       about length of lawful residence - see [19] above).  I am  satisfied
       that the deportation under the EEA Regulations is proportionate when
       the countervailing factors are weighed against  the  seriousness  of
       the offending and the risk which the Appellant continues to pose.  I
       am wholly  satisfied  that  the  Appellant's  conduct  represents  a
       genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one  of
       the fundamental interests of society.

   32. So far as Article 8 ECHR is concerned, the same factors fall  to  be
       assessed  in  relation  to  proportionality  of  deportation  as  in
       relation to the EEA Regulations (see [28] to [30]  above).  For  the
       same reasons, the Appellant's right to respect for  her  family  and
       private life in the UK is heavily outweighed by the public  interest
       in deportation in the interests  of  the  prevention  of  crime  and
       disorder.   Deportation  does  not  constitute  a  breach   of   the
       Appellant's Article 8 rights.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision did involve the making of  an  error  on  a
point of law. I therefore set aside the decision

I re-make the decision  in  the  appeal  by  dismissing  it  under  the  EEA
Regulations and on human rights grounds (Article 8).
