                                                Appeal Number: AA/11269/2012

UPPER TRIBUNAL
IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER

                               THE IMMIGRATION ACTS

Field House
Promulgated on 27 August 2013

                                   Before:
                         Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan

Between:
                                Momodou Njie
                                                                   APPELLANT

                                     and

               The Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  RESPONDENT

                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

   1. For the reasons I gave in my decision of 5 July 2013, I set aside the
      decision of Judge Plimmer made in the Upper Tribunal.
   2. I gave as my provisional view that her reasons for finding an error of
      law were not susceptible to challenge and that, were I to be deciding
      the issue, I would adopt her reasoning for concluding there was an
      error on a point of law.  I asked the parties to comment on that
      proposal.  I have had no response.
   3. I was also minded to direct that the appeal be re-heard before the
      First-tier Tribunal pursuant to paragraph 7.2(b) of the Practice
      Statements of 25 September 2012.  Neither side has objected to this
      proposal.




DECISION

   1. The First-tier Tribunal made an error of law requiring the decision to
      be re-made.
   2. I direct that the re-making of the decision is made by the First-tier
      Tribunal, sitting at Bennett House.
