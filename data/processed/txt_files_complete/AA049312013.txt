                                AHMED IBRAHIM
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. On 9 September 2013 I wrote to the parties as follows:-

        "Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal has been  granted  in
        this case on the basis of an arguable want of procedural fairness
        in the conduct of the proceedings  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
        There was no appearance by the Appellant  at  the  hearing.   The
        Tribunal inspected a copy of the Notice of Hearing and  concluded
        that it had  been  properly  served.   Whether  or  not  that  is
        technically correct, the Respondent has now  confirmed  that  the
        Home Office had knowledge of a change of address;  and  for  that
        reason  the  Respondent  suggests  remittal  to  the   First-tier
        Tribunal.


        In these circumstances I propose to set aside the decision of the
        First-tier Tribunal and remit the appeal to that Tribunal for the
        re-hearing before  a  different  judge  without  more  ado.   Any
        proposal to the contrary will be considered if received within 14
        days of the date of this letter".

 2. No reply has been received and I therefore act  as  foreshadowed.   The
    First-tier Tribunal erred in law in proceeding in the  absence  of  the
    appellant.  Its decision is  set  aside.   The  appellant's  appeal  is
    remitted for decision by the First-tier Tribunal  (constituted  without
    Judge Powell).

VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL

                                                        Date: 8 October 2013
