For the Appellant:     Ms B Jones, Counsel instructed by Irving & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr K Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by a citizen of the Democratic Republic of  Congo  who
    was born in  1986  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State  to
    deport him.

 2. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in 1991  when  he  was  then
    aged 5 years.  He has not had a happy time in the  United  Kingdom.   He
    was taken into care by social services  in  1997  and  he  has  been  in
    trouble with the courts.  In 2007 he was  sent  to  detention  for  four
    months because he had been caught handling stolen goods.  In 2008 he was
    sentenced to three years' imprisonment for an offence  of  robbery.   He
    was warned that he was liable to be deported.  He was in fact  made  the
    subject of a deportation order but he appealed successfully.  In January
    2012 he was convicted of offences involving possession of class A drugs,
    in this case heroin, with intent to  supply  and  he  was  sentenced  to
    custody for 54 months.

 3. That  is  clearly  a  sentence  of  over  four  years'  duration.   This
    apparently uncontroversial observation has become significant because it
    was stated in the appellant's grounds of appeal that  the  sentence  was
    not one of at least four years.  The grounds were  not  settled  by  the
    appellant personally or by his Counsel and they are not to be blamed for
    the error but  it  is  a  bad  mistake  to  have  made  and  undoubtedly
    contributed to permission to appeal being  granted.  Before  me  it  was
    conceded immediately that this is a case where the relevant sentence was
    in excess of four years and that this necessarily  creates  difficulties
    for the appellant because of  the  operation  of  Section  117C  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 4. That said there are things about the Decision that are undistinguished.

 5. Deporting the appellant would interrupt his child's private  and  family
    life and the child is a British  citizen  but  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Decision seemed to have no regard whatsoever for that child's rights  as
    a British citizen.

 6. It is also unsatisfactory that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  seemed  to
    think that the appellant's partner was a citizen of Ghana when she is in
    fact a national of Uganda.  It is not easy to see how this  mistake  was
    made and it is at the very  least  annoying  to  see  African  countries
    lumped together as though they are somehow one homogenous culture.

 7. It is also fitting that I remind myself,  as  Ms  Jones,  properly,  has
    reminded me, that this is a  case  about  deporting  somebody  from  the
    country where he has grown up and spent much of his life to a country he
    could only have known as a child and where living conditions  are  often
    difficult.  We must not become blasï¿½  about  deporting  people  to  poor
    countries that they do not know.  It can be a very, very harsh thing  to
    do.

 8. The difficulty the appellant has in this case are the very  clear  words
    of Section 117C(6) of the Nationality, Immigration an Asylum  Act  2002.
    It is in the following terms:

         "In the case of a foreign criminal who  has  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years the  public  interest
         requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances
         over and above those described in exceptions 1 and 2."

 9. Exception 1 relates to a period of lawful residence and integration into
    the United  Kingdom  and  exception  2  relates  to  relationships  with
    partners and children.  My  attention  was  drawn  to  the  case  of  JZ
    (Zambia) [2016] EWCA Civ 116 which does not seem to  be  concerned  with
    Section 117C but with analogous provisions in the Immigration Rules.  As
    I understand that case it does not permit an interpretation of the Rules
    that ring fences the exceptions  recognised  under  the  Rules  so  that
    circumstances that do not provide what Jackson LJ called a "safety  net"
    must be ignored when deciding if, cumulatively, there  were  exceptional
    circumstances. With respect that case is of limited value.  It  concerns
    the construction of rules and section 117C is not in the same terms. The
    requirements for "very compelling circumstances, over and above" will no
    doubt attract the attention of the higher courts for some time  to  come
    but I do not see how they can exist here.

10. I asked Ms Jones how she could show on  the  evidence  that  there  were
    compelling circumstances over and above those described in exceptions  1
    and 2.  It is no discredit to her  that  she  struggled  to  answer  the
    question.  She had clearly given the matter thought but there is  really
    no answer to that.  The best she could say is that it was possible  that
    a judge looking at the facts cumulatively would have  been  sufficiently
    impressed by all of the circumstances to have allowed an appeal.

11. I remind myself that I am looking to see if there is  an  error  of  law
    which would have to be material.  With respect to  Ms  Jones  I  do  not
    accept that there is anything in this case that  would  enable  a  judge
    deciding the appeal in accordance with the law to  conclude  that  there
    were  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described   in
    exceptions 1 and 2.

12. It follows therefore that  I  am  bound  to  conclude  that  the  errors
    complained of are not material.  They are not made material because  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge referred to "exceptional"  rather  than  "very
    compelling" circumstances.  If there are circumstances where the test is
    material different they do not exist here.

13. Section 117 in its amended form was clearly intended  to  make  it  very
    difficult to allow  the  appeals  of  foreign  criminals  who  had  been
    sentenced to more than four years' imprisonment.  This appellant is such
    a person.  Notwithstanding careful submissions from Ms Jones I  just  do
    not see how the evidence could possibly support a conclusion that  there
    were such circumstances here and I have to decide therefore  that  there
    is no material error and I dismiss the appellant's appeal.  That  is  my
    decision.
