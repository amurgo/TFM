                                                                  respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Katherine Watson), sitting  at  Birmingham  on  6  June
    2018, to  an asylum and human rights appeal by  a  Kurdish  citizen  of
    Iraq, born 1991.

 2. There were effectively three elements to the appellant's claim: risk

      a)      from the family  of  a  girl  called  [S]:  he  had  formed  a
         relationship with her in 2015, not been allowed to marry  her,  but
         had last seen her in August, and in October received calls,  saying
         he had made her pregnant, and threatening  him  with  death,  as  a
         result of which he had left Iraq.


      b)      from Daesh  (otherwise  known  as  ISIS):  as  the  respondent
         accepted, the appellant had worked as a driver for the  Pesh  Merga
         (Kurdish national militant organization) from 2011. In  July  2015,
         neighbours who were Daesh sympathizers started to cause trouble for
         him, and he began to receive, first threatening calls, and  then  a
         letter.

      c)      by way of being returned to Kirkuk: the judge had thought this
         was within the IKR [Iraqi Kurdish Region]; but,  as  agreed  before
         me, it is not.

 3. On (a), the appellant had passed through France on his  way  here,  and
    been met with by the French authorities. On 23 January 2016 he  arrived
    at Dover in the back of a lorry, and when found by the authorities here
    produced documents dealing with his contact with those in France, where
    his name is given as Majed Dara. One of these, including a  translation
    from Google, reads as follows,  so  far  as  relevant  [orthography  as
    original]:

       ... considerant que monsieur majed dara est mari� a  une  compatriote
       qui reside en Irak avec ses enfants  ...  qu'il  n'�tablit  pas  etre
       isol� dans son pays d'origine ou resident sa femme, ses deux enfants,
       sa mere et ses deux soeurs ...

 4. This is translated, plainly accurately, so far as the basic sense goes:

       Considering that Mr Majed Dara is  married  to  a  fellow  countryman
       residing in Iraq with his children ... that  he  does  not  establish
       isolation in his country of origin  where  his  wife,  two  children,
       mother and two sisters live.

 5. While permission to appeal was given  on  the  basis  that  the  Google
    translation should not have been admitted in evidence, it is clear from
    the appellant's evidence before the judge (see paragraph 19)  that  his
    real complaint had been about  the  Kurdish  interpreter  used  by  the
    French authorities, and  not  about  the  translation  from  French  to
    English. He did not accept that the interpreter spoke  his  own  Sorani
    Kurdish, claimed he had been "made to say things", and denied having  a
    wife and children in Iraq.

 6. While the judge's  treatment  of  this  evidence  at  paragraph  23  is
    superficially contradictory, she was clearly entitled to regard  it  as
    wholly inconsistent with his present claim (a). That point was taken in
    the refusal letter (see the  judge's  5),  and,  though  the  appellant
    complains that he was not asked about the translation at either of  his
    interviews, or shown it till shortly before the hearing, as  the  judge
    points out, it had been produced by him in the first place.

 7. The rest  of  the  original  French  document,  also  produced  by  the
    appellant, from which the excerpt is taken (see B21 - 22, the decree on
    behalf of the prefect of the d�partment of the Nord, expelling him from
    France) is concerned with French immigration legislation  (CESEDA)  and
    his situation  there,  and  this  excerpt  is  the  appellant's  entire
    account, as given, of his circumstances in Iraq.

 8. The French interpreter is simply recorded as speaking Kurdish,  without
    any dialect given; but  putting  a  wife  and  two  children  into  the
    appellant's  mouth  was  clearly  not  a  question   of   problems   in
    interpretation. It amounted to a wholesale allegation of  invention  by
    the interpreter, for no  apparent  reason,  and  the  judge  was  fully
    entitled to disbelieve  claim  (a)  in  its  entirety.  No  independent
    evidence of [S]'s existence was put forward.

 9. Turning to claim (b), the judge dealt with this on the basis  that  the
    Home  Office  CIPN  report  showed  that  the  profile   for   forcible
    recruitment by ISIS gave those under 18, who were  vulnerable,  or  who
    used social media, as the targets; but this appellant was  already  24,
    and an active member of the Pesh Merga. The appellant was not  in  fact
    saying he was at risk as a general recruitment target: see his comments
    on paragraphs 40 - 43 of the refusal letter, at  paragraph  10  of  his
    appeal statement. His case was that he had been a member  of  the  Pesh
    Merga, and his neighbours, Daesh/ISIS members, had tried  to  make  him
    join them. Then he had reported his neighbours  to  the  Asayish  [Pesh
    Merga security organization], following which ISIS had threatened  him,
    on pain of death, to join them.

10. The appellant goes on to say that Kirkuk, as is common  knowledge,  had
    now been taken over by government forces, who  had  displaced  Asayish;
    but they would not protect him from Daesh/ISIS.  There  is  however  no
    reference in his statement, or counsel's  grounds  of  appeal,  or  the
    solicitors' 'skeletal argument', both of which  were  mainly  concerned
    with claim (a), nor  in  Mrs  Dury's  submissions  before  me,  to  any
    evidence to support any continuing risk from Daesh/ISIS in  the  Kirkuk
    area, now that they have been reduced to an itinerant  rump,  following
    the capture of their last remaining territory in Syria.

11. It follows that, though the judge's way of  dealing  with  (b)  on  the
    general background evidence left something to be desired,  it  involved
    no material error of law, since  this  was  not  a  claim  which  could
    succeed on the evidence presented at the present time. That leaves  the
    appellant with his final claim (c).

12. As already made clear, the judge was certainly wrong to  regard  Kirkuk
    as being within the IKR. Mrs Dury argued that he  would  need  a  Civil
    Status  Identity  Document  [CSID]  to  return  there,  as   government
    territory,  which  is  supported  by  AAH  (Iraqi  Kurds   -   internal
    relocation) (CG) [2018] UKUT 212 (IAC), read with AA (Iraq) [2017] EWCA
    Civ 944.

13. On the other hand, looking at AAH, the guidance began like this:

       1.     Whilst it remains possible for an Iraqi national returnee (P)
         to obtain a new CSID whether P is able to do so, or do so within a
         reasonable time frame, will depend on the individual circumstances.
         Factors to be considered include:
         i) Whether P has any other form of  documentation,  or  information
         about the location of his entry in  the  civil  register.  An  INC,
         passport, birth/marriage certificates or an expired CSID would  all
         be of substantial assistance. For someone in possession of  one  or
         more of these documents the process should be straightforward.

14. This appellant's own evidence before the  judge  was  as  follows  (see
    paragraph 29):


       ... it was possible to obtain a replacement CSID card, though  not  a
       passport, He has family members in the IKR, although on  his  account
       he has not been able to contact them this year. He  has  friends  and
       the authorities are likely to have information about him  as  he  has
       obtained a visa to leave the country so  that  he  will  be  able  to
       obtain a CSID card on return.


15. On that basis, I see no reason why the appellant's return  to  Baghdad,
    and thence to Kirkuk, should be other than straightforward: he  had  to
    have a passport of course to get a visa in 2016. As already  discussed,
    he would not be at any real risk of  Convention  harm  there,  and  the
    judge's finding (at 33) that there is no longer any article 15 (c) risk
    in the city is not challenged in his grounds of appeal.


16. Since no other point was taken on the consequences of  the  appellant's
    return to Kirkuk in the grounds of appeal, or  before  us,  it  follows
    that claim (c) also fails. However it is worth pointing  out  that  the
    judge also found at 30 that he had worked (for the Pesh Merga)  in  the
    IKR, and showed a good knowledge of the area in his interview. Although
    this point was not canvassed before me, it is most likely that he would
    be accepted back in the IKR.
