                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Miss G Patel (counsel instructed by  Ramsbottom & Co, Blackburn) for the
appellant
Mr J Wyatt for the respondent

   This is an appeal from a decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Mr  AJ  Blake),
   sitting at Taylor House on 8 November 2002,  dismissing  an  asylum  and
   human rights appeal by a Kurdish citizen of Iraq. Leave was given on the
   basis that the adjudicator did not consider properly  whether  effective
   protection  would  be  available:  that  means  against  breach  of  the
   appellant's human rights, because the adjudicator had  agreed  with  the
   certificate on the asylum appeal. What he had then done, however, was to
   dismiss the human rights grounds  without  reviewing  their  merits.  If
   those have already been fully discussed on the asylum appeal,  that  may
   be perfectly all right; but this adjudicator had dismissed  that  mainly
   for want of a Convention reason.

2. There was a report before us from a Miss SJ Laizer dated 27 June: though
   it only arrived on the morning of the hearing, Mr Wyatt was prepared  to
   consider it, in the interests of finality, and so  were  we.  It  mainly
   deals with the risks she says this appellant would face on return to the
   KAA [Kurdish Autonomous Area]. That was the  only  destination  (however
   hypothetical) under the previous Home Office policy on returns to  Iraq.
   We drew Miss Patel's attention to the  current  Home  Office  policy  on
   returns to Iraq, set out at � 5.2 of  the  CIPU  bulletin  4/2003  (June
   2003):

   Enforced removals will be effected as soon as it is  practicable  to  do
   so. There are several potential routes including to or  via  Baghdad  or
   Basra, or directly to airports in  Mosul  or  Erbil  where  humanitarian
   passenger flights are currently landing.

3. As Miss Patel rightly conceded, there is nothing in Miss Laizer's report
   (or any other material to which she was able to refer us) to suggest any
   present real risk for someone like this appellant on return to  anywhere
   outside the KAA. She nonetheless asked us to  send  the  case  back  for
   rehearing by an adjudicator. If she had been able to  make  a  case  for
   something in the appellant's individual history  leading  to  a  present
   real risk on return on the background evidence as it  stood,  then  that
   might have been necessary: however it was for the  appellant  and  those
   representing him to make his case  on  any  point  in  his  own  history
   relevant to what might face him outside the KAA, and they have not  done
   so.

4. Assuming in this  appellant's  favour,  not  only  that  his  individual
   history is true, but that Miss Laizer is right in saying it still raises
   a real risk on return to the KAA, he would not be entitled to succeed on
   the basis that it would be unduly harsh to send him back  to  the  south
   (what had been government-controlled territory),  because  there  is  no
   asylum appeal before us:  see  our  first  paragraph.  However,  on  our
   reading of the Robinson [1997] Imm AR 568 test, it must be  regarded  as
   substantially equivalent to what is in practice the minimum  requirement
   for success in a human rights appeal of this kind, which is that  return
   should involve "inhuman or degrading treatment"; so nothing  substantial
   turns on that.

5. The reason Miss Patel put forward against return to the south  was  that
   the appellant had never lived there before, and had strong  family  ties
   in the north: that is also the  reason  why  there  is  nothing  in  his
   individual history which raises any real risk on return to the south. As
   we pointed out, and she had to accept, he had not lived in this  country
   either before he came here to seek asylum. While Miss Laizer does  point
   (at � 6 of her report) to some evidence of  continuing  instability  and
   unrest in the south, there is nothing specific to suggest that it  would
   be either inhuman (or unduly harsh, if that were the  test)  to  require
   this appellant, an apparently fit young man of nearly 26, to  return  to
   his country of origin under the protection of the  Allied  forces  which
   has been so dearly established in money and blood.
