                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant,  a  citizen  of  Afghanistan,  appeals  with  permission
    against the decision of a  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Onoufriou)  in
    which he dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    refusal to grant him protection.  The starting  point  in  this  appeal
    revolves around the issue of an age dispute.  The Appellant  claims  he
    was born on 11th January 2001 and thus when he made his claim to asylum
    in July 2016, he was  15ï¿½  years  of  age.   The  Respondent  puts  the
    Appellant's date of birth as 1st September 1997.

 2. It is correct to say that for the purposes of  the  Appellant's  asylum
    interview, he was treated as an adult.

 3. The Respondent based the Appellant's age upon the contents  of  an  age
    assessment report obtained from Leicestershire County Council.  It  has
    been the Appellant's case, certainly since the date of his Home  Office
    interview, that his age is in dispute.

 4. When the Appellant's appeal came before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    judge  correctly  identified,  in  what  he   termed   as   preliminary
    discussions, the issue of the Appellant's age.  At the  outset  of  the
    hearing it seems there was no age  assessment  report  available.   The
    judge raised a query about this during the course  of  the  proceedings
    and pointed out to the Respondent that the Appellant had raised an  age
    dispute.

 5. Following a brief adjournment the Respondent's representative  produced
    a document from Leicestershire County Council entitled "Outcome of  Age
    Assessment".  This document assessed the Appellant's date of  birth  as
    1st January 1997 (and thus made him 19 years of  age  at  the  date  of
    hearing).

 6.  The  Appellant's  representative  however   pointed   out   that   the
    Leicestershire County Council document which had been produced:

          i) was merely a summary; and






         ii) there was no evidence that the  summary  report  was  "Merton"
             compliant.


    She asked for an adjournment in order that the full report (namely  one
    upon which the summary was based) be produced.

 7. The Respondent at this point intimated that there was no guarantee that
    a fuller document was available and rather than have the case adjourned
    she would prefer that the age assessment summary document be  withdrawn
    and that the judge make his own deductions  regarding  the  Appellant's
    age.

 8. The judge then said this at [9]:

         "I pointed out that the appellant did make it clear in his AIR that
         he disputed the age attributed to him by the respondent but  as  Ms
         Karbani stated  that  the  respondent  did  not  have  any  further
         documents, I would admit the document but attach much  less  weight
         to it than otherwise if it was Merton compliant.  I did  note  that
         the summary assessment  stated  that  it  complied  "with  guidance
         arising from the Merton judgment and subsequent case  law",  but  I
         considered that without the full report upon which the summary  was
         based, I could not treat  it  as  Merton  compliant.   I  therefore
         indicated to Ms Karbani that she needed to deal with the case as if
         the appellant was either an adult or a child prior to me making  an
         assessment on his age following the evidence."

 9. It would appear that at that point the judge's decision  was  to  admit
    the document.

10. He then went on to hear  evidence  from  both  the  Appellant  and  his
    witness. In [41] he set out his analysis of the evidence  dealing  with
    the Appellant's age.  He noted discrepant evidence from  the  Appellant
    and his brother and therefore placed no reliance on that  evidence.  He
    then said that "... the appellant certainly physically looked more than
    18 years  and  his  demeanour  in  answering  the  questions  certainly
    suggested  someone  comparatively  mature."   The  judge  then  made  a
    declaration at the conclusion of [41] saying the following:

         "I therefore conclude that the Appellant is over  18  and  I  reach
         this conclusion totally ignoring the  age  assessment  prepared  by
         Leicestershire County Council which I considered to  be  non-Merton
         compliant."

11. Thereafter in [42] in his assessment of  the  Appellant's  credibility,
    the judge states:

         "... Likewise, the fact that he traced his brother through Facebook
         when he had no contact with him and no idea of his  whereabouts  is
         also highly implausible."

12.  Following  these  declarations  the  judge  then   analysed   evidence
    concerning risk on return to Afghanistan, treating the Appellant as  an
    adult. He then dismissed the appeal.

13. The Appellant sought and was granted permission to appeal.   The  grant
    of permission, simply said:

         "It is arguable that the judge has misdirected himself in assessing



          i) the Appellant's age; and




         ii) the plausibility of the evidence in relation to the  Appellant
             reconnecting with his brother via Facebook."

14. Thus the matter comes before me to determine whether  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal contains such error of law that it requires  to
    be set aside and remade.

Error of Law Hearing

15. Before me Mr Grailsford appeared for the Appellant, and Ms Everett  for
    the Respondent.  Mr Grailsford, following  the  lines  of  the  grounds
    seeking permission, emphasised that once the FtTJ had said that he  was
    totally ignoring the summary age assessment document, then there was no
    evidence left to counter the oral evidence given by the Appellant,  and
    his brother, that he was under the age of 18 years.

16. Additionally, stepping back to the question of the report  itself,  the
    judge was in error in not granting an adjournment so  that  an  enquiry
    could be made of Leicestershire County Council on whether or not  there
    was a full report available.  An Appellant is entitled to know and have
    placed before him any relevant evidence which may be available.  He  is
    entitled to know the extent of such evidence,  not  least  in  that  it
    allows him an opportunity to challenge it.

17. Mr  Grailsford  then  addressed  me  on  the  assessment  made  of  the
    plausibility of the Appellant tracing his brother through Facebook.  He
    said that the whole point of Facebook is that it enables people to make
    contact with Facebook subscribers, simply by searching for a name.   To
    use that fact to discredit the  Appellant,  together  with  the  errors
    concerning the evidence of the age assessment report,  meant  that  the
    decision was infected by material error.  It should  therefore  be  set
    aside to be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.

18. Ms Everett filed a  Rule  24  response  defending  the  decision.   She
    submitted that the Respondent had withdrawn the summary age  assessment
    report.  It was then up to the judge to assess the Appellant's  age  on
    the evidence before him.  There was no error in  the  judge  proceeding
    this way.

19. So far as the second ground is concerned she did accept  that  Facebook
    does provide a mechanism for contacting people simply by searching  for
    their name, but said that the judge in this matter found as a fact that
    it was highly implausible that the  Appellant  recognised  his  brother
    whom he had not seen for ten years, simply by looking at a  photograph.
    That was a finding open to the judge.

20. At the end of submissions I reserved my decision which I now give  with
    reasons.

Consideration and Findings

21. I find force in Mr Grailsford's submission and am  satisfied  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be set aside for legal  error.
    I say this because at [9] at the start of the  proceedings  it  appears
    that the FtTJ was admitting the age assessment summary  report,  albeit
    with lesser weight as it was not Merton compliant.  Added into  this  I
    note that it  was  the  judge  who  made  the  enquiry  about  the  age
    assessment report, which  then  produced  the  result  that  there  was
    available a summary assessment only.  The Appellant's representative at
    that stage properly asked for the full report  to  be  made  available.
    The answer came back that there was no guarantee that a fuller document
    was available, but certainly it appears that no proper enquiry was made
    on the availability or otherwise of the full assessment report.

22. It is my judgment that if there  is  relevant  evidence  which  may  be
    available, then a proper enquiry should be made to determine whether or
    not that evidence can be made available to  the  Tribunal  and  to  the
    Appellant.  The availability of such evidence to the Tribunal would  no
    doubt assist it in coming to a proper decision.  The point here is that
    the Respondent has not made any enquiry as to whether a full report  is
    available.  Not to do so deprives the Appellant of the  opportunity  to
    challenge the evidence upon which his age has been determined.

23. Having stated at [9] that he would admit the age assessment summary but
    attach much less weight to it than if it  were  Merton  compliant,  the
    FtTJ has gone on to state at [41] that he has  reached  his  conclusion
    that  the  Appellant  is  over  18  having  totally  ignored  the   age
    assessment.  These two statements are contradictory; it is not open  to
    a judge to totally ignore evidence that he has previously admitted.

24. I find that the above errors are material ones and are ones  which  are
    capable of affecting the whole decision.  If the appellant is indeed  a
    minor then his evidence must viewed in  that  light  and  any  risk  on
    return evaluated likewise.  I therefore set aside the decision  in  its
    entirety.  That is sufficient to dispose of this appeal and I  find  it
    is unnecessary to make any separate  finding  on  the  plausibility  or
    otherwise of the point raised in the ground 2 concerning the  Appellant
    reconnecting with his brother through Facebook.

25. The decision will have to be re-made and fresh findings of  fact  made.
    It is right that the matter be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  for
    a fresh hearing before a judge other than FtTJ Onoufriou.

26.  I  direct  the  Respondent  to  make  the  appropriate  enquiry   with
    Leicestershire County Council to obtain the full age assessment report,
    or if none is available to provide an explanation as to why it has  not
    been possible to access the same.

Notice of Decision

The appeal before the Upper Tribunal is  allowed  to  the  extent  that  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 30th August 2017  is  set
aside.  The matter is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  full
rehearing, before a judge other than Judge Onoufriou.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
