For the respondent:  Ms C Hanrahan, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.     The  appellant,  a  citizen  of  Afghanistan,  appeals  against   the
      determination of an Adjudicator (Mrs  N  Bircher)  who  dismissed  his
      appeal against the decision made on 23 July 2002 giving directions for
      his removal following the refusal of his claim for asylum.

2.    The appellant left Afghanistan on 15 April 2002  travelling  by  lorry
      through Iran and Turkey to the United Kingdom.  He made a  clandestine
      entry on 20 June 2002 claiming asylum the following day.   He  claimed
      to be in fear  of  persecution  from  the  Taliban  and  the  Northern
      Alliance due to his Pashtun ethnicity and his activities fighting  for
      the Taliban.  The appellant said that in  1992  his  father  had  been
      arrested and killed by General Dostum.   He  claimed  that  his  elder
      brother joined Hezb-e-Islami to take revenge for his  father's  death.
      His brother fought for Hezb-e-Islami for four years.  In 1998  Taliban
      men came to his home and arrested  his  brother  and  took  him  to  a
      detention centre.  He was released  on  condition  that  he  would  be
      available to fight for the  Taliban  in  future.   In  1999  when  the
      Taliban were in need of people to fight against the Northern  Alliance
      people came to his home and took his brother to the frontline.   After
      four months his brother was released and came back home.  It  was  the
      appellant's claim that during the Taliban regime he had been  arrested
      many times and beaten for not having a long beard and not praying five
      times a day.

3.    After the events of 11 September 2001 the Taliban started  to  recruit
      people to fight against the Northern Alliance and the Americans.   His
      brother was taken to the frontline and was killed  in  action.   After
      one week his uncle came and took the appellant to his home.   After  a
      month the Northern Alliance found out about this and came to his  home
      and beat his uncle.   His  uncle  was  warned  that  if  the  Northern
      Alliance found him he would be killed.  It was then decided  that  the
      appellant should leave the country.

4.    The Secretary of State concluded that the appellant  did  not  qualify
      for asylum.  It was his  view  that  the  transitional  administration
      empowered under the Bonn Agreement was acting in accordance with basic
      principals and provisions contained in  international  instruments  on
      human rights and international humanitarian law.  He was not satisfied
      that the appellant would be at risk  of  persecution  because  of  his
      Pashtun ethnicity or because of any  imputed  political  opinion.   He
      would be able to move to an  area  where  his  ethnic  group  did  not
      constitute a minority and where he would face no difficulties.   There
      were authorities in Kabul to  whom  the  appellant  could  appeal  for
      protection should the need arise.  The Secretary of  State  noted  the
      claimant's concluding statement at  interview  that  he  had  come  to
      complete his education.

5.    The appellant gave oral evidence  before  the  Adjudicator  confirming
      the contents of his statement.  He said that his mother and uncle were
      still in Afghanistan but he  had  no  communication  from  them.   The
      Adjudicator did not accept the appellant's evidence.  She said that he
      had produced no corroborative evidence to support his claims.  Looking
      at the objective evidence she found that there were sufficient systems
      in place to provide the appellant with protection.   The  transitional
      administration appeared to be operating effectively and recent reports
      show that there was a level of security and  protection  available  to
      the appellant to protect him on return.

6.    In the grounds of appeal it is argued that the Adjudicator  failed  to
      take into account relevant evidence when  assessing  the  claim  as  a
      whole.  Her finding that she did not accept  the  appellant's  account
      was unreasonable as she failed to give any clear or coherent  reasons.
      It was not clear what corroborative evidence the Adjudicator required.
       It was unclear what evidence the adjudicator had taken into  account.
      When the Adjudicator referred to finding on balance  that  there  were
      sufficient systems in place to provide the appellant with  protection,
      this indicated that the wrong standard of proof had been applied.

7.    Miss Iqbal adopted these grounds in her submissions.  She argued  that
      there had been no proper consideration of the issues.  The Adjudicator
      had not explained why she did not believe the appellant's account.  It
      was unclear what corroborative evidence  should  have  been  supplied.
      The appellant had three bases for his fear of persecution.  His father
      had been employed in a good position  in  the  Najibullah  Government.
      His brother had joined the Hezb-e-Islami.  In 1998 both the  appellant
      and his brother had  been  forced  to  fight  for  the  Taliban.   The
      appellant would be at risk because of his association with  all  these
      organisations.  The Adjudicator should have made specific findings  on
      these issues.

8.    It was not satisfactory just to say that sufficient protection was  in
      place.  The appellant would be at risk in Kabul.  There  was  evidence
      that the Northern Alliance were targeting other  groups.   The  appeal
      should be remitted for a fresh hearing.

9.    Ms Hanrahan referred to the CIPU Report arguing that  the  Adjudicator
      had been entitled to come  to  the  conclusion  that  there  would  be
      sufficient protection for the appellant in Afghanistan.

10.   The Adjudicator did not believe the appellant's  evidence.   Ms Iqbal
      argues that the Adjudicator has not given adequate  reasons  for  that
      finding.  She argues that it is insufficient simply  to  say  that  he
      produced  no  corroborative  evidence  to  support  his  claims.   The
      Tribunal accepts that the Adjudicator's reasoning  is  not  adequately
      expressed.  The issue is whether the  lack  of  reasoning  leaves  the
      Tribunal with a real  as  opposed  to  a  forensic  doubt  as  to  the
      Adjudicator's findings on credibility: R v Secretary of State ex parte
      Atpularajah [2001] Imm AR 566.

11.   In his decision letter dated 19  July  2002  the  Secretary  of  State
      noted discrepancies between the accounts given by the appellant  which
      are highlighted in paragraph 10 of  his  letter.   During  his  asylum
      interview the appellant stated that he was taken  to  fight  with  the
      Taliban twice prior to his departure from Afghanistan whereas this was
      later contradicted when he said he was only taken to the front on  one
      occasion.  In his statement the appellant made  no  mention  of  being
      taken to the front on two occasions.  In his interview  he  said  that
      the Panjsheris came to visit his mother two and a half months prior to
      his departure from Afghanistan and on that  occasion  his  mother  was
      alone in the house.  There was no mention  of  this  incident  in  the
      statement but reference to  a  similar  incident  when  the  appellant
      claimed that both his mother and uncle were present at a visit by  the
      Northern Alliance.

12.   The Secretary of State also noted the appellant's  concluding  comment
      at his asylum interview that he came to complete his  education.   The
      appellant had not claimed to have any political  affiliations  to  any
      organisation  in  Afghanistan.   He  noted  that  the  appellant   had
      travelled through a number  of  European  countries  without  claiming
      asylum.  Looking at these factors in the light of  all  the  evidence,
      the Tribunal are not satisfied that there is any reasonable degree  of
      likelihood that the claimant's account of why he left  Afghanistan  is
      true.  In our  view  the  Adjudicator's  finding  on  credibility  was
      correct even though she could have set out her reasons more clearly.

13.   The Tribunal are not satisfied that any risk arises to  the  appellant
      from the fact of being a Pashtun.  If he is returned to Kabul there is
      no reason to believe  that  he  will  not  be  able  to  look  to  the
      authorities there for  protection.   The  transitional  administration
      includes Pashtuns as well as members of the other ethnic groups.  Even
      if the appellant did fight for  the  Taliban  for  a  short  time  the
      Tribunal are not satisfied that his low level involvement is such that
      he would be of any interest to the present authorities.  The fact that
      his father held a good position during the Najibullah regime would not
      put the appellant at risk.   It  is  only  family  members  of  senior
      officials who would  now  be  at  any  risk.   The  Tribunal  are  not
      satisfied  that  it  is  arguable  that  the   appellant's   brother's
      involvement with Hezb-e-Islami would put the appellant at risk.

14.   In our judgment  the  Adjudicator's  conclusions  were  correct.   The
      Tribunal are not satisfied that there  is  any  reasonable  degree  of
      likelihood that the appellant would be at risk  of  persecution  or  a
      breach of his rights under  Article  3  were  he  to  be  returned  to
      Afghanistan.

15.   This appeal is dismissed.
