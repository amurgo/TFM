For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Mongolia who applied for leave to  remain
    in the United Kingdom as the partner of Mr Andrew  Harland,  a  British
    citizen.  The Respondent  refused  the  Appellant's  application.   The
    Appellant appealed to  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rastogi  who  in  a
    decision promulgated on 4th July 2017 dismissed her appeal.

 2. It is helpful to set out some of the  judge's  material  findings.   In
    paragraph 3 she noted  that  the  Appellant  was  unable  to  meet  the
    eligibility requirements under Appendix FM because she was here  as  an
    overstayer and as such was in breach of  the  immigration  rules.   The
    judge explained that if the Appellant was unable to satisfy  the  Rules
    then she had to decide if  there  were  any  circumstances  which  were
    sufficiently compelling to justify a grant of leave outside the  Rules.
    In paragraph 13 of the decision the judge noted  that she came here  on
    26 May 2007 on a student visa and has been here ever  since.   She  met
    and formed a relationship with Mr Harland in 2009 and  they  have  been
    living together since 2012.   They  are  engaged  to  be  married.   Mr
    Harland is a British citizen and all his family live here.

 3. In paragraphs 13 - 17 the judge set out  the  Appellant's  case  noting
    that in 2015 the Appellant was diagnosed with breast cancer and she had
    to undergo a mastectomy provided to her on the NHS.  As her cancer  was
    serious there was a high risk  that  it  will  return.   The  Appellant
    accepted that her life expectancy was  reduced  and  claimed  that  her
    prospects of remaining free from  cancer  for  any  significant  period
    would be significantly reduced if she returned to Mongolia.  She  noted
    that Mr Harland was a chef earning ï¿½3,500 per month and  so  is  easily
    able to support the Appellant and continue to pay for the medication.

 4. The judge heard submissions from both parties and set out her  findings
    of fact and issues commencing at paragraph  20  of  the  decision.   In
    paragraph 27 she said that as to  the  availability  of  medication  in
    Mongolia Mr Harland had stated  that  Tamoxifen  is  readily  available
    worldwide.  He explained he was unable to find out about  Goserelin  as
    it is difficult to carry out this research.  The judge noted (paragraph
    28) that the Appellant was only required to take Goserelin  for  a  two
    year period and she commenced the treatment in September 2015.  As such
    she is due to complete the course by September  2017.   The  judge  was
    satisfied on the basis of the evidence of Mr Harland that Tamoxifen was
    available in Mongolia.  In  paragraph  29  the  judge  noted  that  the
    Appellant's evidence revealed that they considered the main barrier  to
    Mr Harland relocating to Mongolia to be the fact that he  was  unlikely
    to be able to work due to language barriers.  He explained in his  oral
    evidence that he had not researched what work may be available for  him
    as he felt the language barrier would make work impossible.  The  judge
    noted that he is a chef.  She had not been told anything more about his
    particular expertise.  In the context of the  catering  industry  where
    foreign travel was common place the  judge  noted  that  kitchens  were
    commonly staffed by those from   other  countries  often  with  limited
    language skills in the countries  in  which  they  work;  as  such  the
    Appellant had failed to satisfy her that if  Mr  Harland  relocated  to
    Mongolia with her, he would be unable to earn a living as a chef.   The
    fact that he cannot speak the language might make  it  more  difficult,
    but certainly she did not find it to be a barrier  that  the  Appellant
    and Mr Harland feared.  In  paragraph  30  the  judge  noted  that  the
    Appellant did not present any other  evidence  about  obstacles  to  Mr
    Harland relocating to Mongolia.  Obviously he was a British citizen and
    presumably he did not have an automatic right to reside there.  She had
    not been presented with any evidence that he would be unable to do  so.



 5. The judge referred to Agyarko v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 and set out factors
    which, did not, on their own, amount to  insurmountable  obstacles  and
    that included the fact of British citizenship, lifelong residence and a
    job in  the  United  Kingdom,  difficulties  in  and  a  reluctance  to
    relocate.

 6. In all the circumstances and on  the  evidence  presented  to  her  the
    Appellant had failed to satisfy  her  that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to her family life with Mr Harland  continuing  in  Mongolia.
    Accordingly she did not find her able to meet the requirements  of  the
    Rules.  The judge then referred to the Razgar question and to  Huang  v
    SSHD [2007] UKHL 11.  She  also  referred  to  the  commentary  in  the
    Supreme Court case of MM (Lebanon) and Ors v SSHD [2017] UKSC 10.   The
    judge had no reason to doubt Mr Harland's credibility and  in  fact  he
    was very candid about the availability of Tamoxifen in  Mongolia.   She
    did not find the public interest offended by  the  Appellant  remaining
    here on financial grounds.  In paragraph 45 the judge found that if the
    Appellant were to return to Mongolia to make an application  for  entry
    clearance, providing this was  after  September  2017  she  would  have
    available to her Tamoxifen which  Mr  Harland  could  pay  for  on  her
    behalf.  She reminded herself of the opinion of the  Supreme  Court  in
    Agyarko as to the need for  the  Respondent's  decision  to  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for the Appellant or her spouse,  even
    if they fall short of amounting to insurmountable  obstacles  before  a
    decision to remove the Appellant would breach her protected rights.

 7. In paragraph 49 the judge considered whether the  temporary  separation
    of the Appellant was a  disproportionate  breach  of  their  rights  in
    respect of their right to family life but did not find that to  be  so.
    In paragraph 50 the judge said that she could only attach little weight
    to the family life between the Appellant and Mr Harland  and  that  she
    should attach significant weight to the fact  that  the  Appellant  was
    unable to meet the requirements of the  Rules,  and  finally  that  the
    Appellant's relationship was formed while her stay here was unlawful.

 8. She then went on to dismiss the appeal.

 9.  Grounds  of  application  were  lodged.   It  was  said   there   were
    insurmountable obstacles for both the Appellant and  her  partner  were
    she to be returned to Mongolia.  The Appellant's partner,  Mr  Harland,
    had given evidence that he was British, could not  speak  the  language
    and that if he lived in Mongolia he would not be  able  to  work.   The
    issue in the case was whether it was proportional for the Appellant  to
    be separated from her partner and make an entry clearance  application,
    the Respondent's position being that  the  Appellant  should  apply  to
    return to the UK from Mongolia.  The grounds narrate the evidence of Mr
    Harland.  If the Appellant were to be returned to Mongolia there  would
    be an interruption in her treatment which was currently being paid  for
    by him.  The Appellant spoke English, was supported  by  her  partner's
    earnings and the  NHS  bill  was  now  paid  and  they  had  a  genuine
    relationship.  Applying Agyarko the court was invited to find that  the
    judge erred in failing to find an insurmountable obstacle in the  case.
    Furthermore, it was said the judge erred in considering Article  8  and
    that removal was unjustifiably harsh given the couple's  circumstances.



10. Permission to appeal was granted principally on the  basis  that  judge
    may have been looking at the issue of insurmountable obstacles  not  at
    the date of the hearing but at a future date.  The Secretary  of  State
    lodged a Rule 24 notice submitting that the judge took into account the
    Appellant's ties to Mongolia and the Sponsor's skills as  a  chef.   It
    was further argued that the judge made  very  meticulous  and  reasoned
    findings in relation to the Appellant's Article 8  rights  outside  the
    Rules and found that the interference would  not  be  disproportionate.
    As such the Respondent submitted that the judge  had  directed  herself
    appropriately.

11. Thus the matter came before me on the above date.

12. For the Appellant Ms Record said  that  if  an  application  for  entry
    clearance by the Appellant was refused, it might take up to  two  years
    before she could get back to the United  Kingdom.   She  was  under  an
    ongoing review from her doctor in relation to her cancer.  It  was  odd
    of the judge to conclude, as she did, that the  Respondent  should  not
    take any steps to remove the Appellant from the  United  Kingdom  until
    the  end  of  September  2017,  which   suggested   that   there   were
    insurmountable obstacles to her returning there.

13. This was an Article 8, not an Article 3 case.  The decision  should  be
    set aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

14. For the Home Office  Ms  Ahmad  submitted  that  the  judge  had  fully
    considered all the material issues.  In particular, at paragraph 28 the
    judge noted that the Appellant was only required to take Goserelin  for
    a two year period and as such she was due to  complete  the  course  by
    September 2017.  She  was  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
    presented to her that Tamoxifen was available.  As such the  judge  had
    made it clear that the Appellant would continue to receive  appropriate
    medical treatment.  Furthermore, she had  noted  that  Mr  Harland  had
    skills as a chef.  While another judge might have come to  a  different
    conclusion, there was  no  error  or  material  error  in  the  judge's
    findings and the decision should stand.

15. I reserved my decision.



Conclusions

16. I have set out the judge's decision in some detail as  she  gave  clear
    reasons why there were no insurmountable obstacles to her  family  life
    with Mr Harland continuing in Mongolia.  Those reasons include the fact
    that she was only required to take certain medication, namely Goserelin
    for a two year period which would expire in September 2017,  and  after
    that the  medication  she  required  to  take,  namely  Tamoxifen,  was
    available - based on the evidence of Mr  Harland  which  she  accepted.
    None of this is disputed and the judge was  not  speculating  into  the
    future but looking at the position as  at  the  date  of  the  hearing.
    While Mr Harland claimed he would be unable to earn a living as a chef,
    the judge accepted that because he could not speak  the  language  that
    would make the task of obtaining employment more  difficult,  but  that
    factor did not amount to an insurmountable obstacle. The judge  applied
    the relevant case law - it is not suggested otherwise. Accordingly,  it
    seems to me that the judge fully assessed the  Appellant's  case  under
    insurmountable obstacles and, for the reasons stated,  found  that  the
    Appellant was not able to establish that there were such obstacles.

17. She considered the Article 8 case in considerable detail  referring  to
    well-known case law.  She  considered  the  financial  position  of  Mr
    Harland.  In particular she noted that the Appellant accepted  that  at
    the time her relationship with Mr Harland was formed she was here as an
    overstayer and therefore here unlawfully  and  precariously  (paragraph
    42).  In paragraph 45 she said it was clear that if the Appellant  were
    to return to Mongolia to make an application for  entry  clearance  she
    would have available to her Tamoxifen which Mr Harland could pay for on
    her behalf and which he could afford as he would still be working here.
     She had no evidential basis for finding that, were this to happen, the
    Appellant would nevertheless  become  unwell  and  she  would  then  be
    deprived of Mr Harland's support through a very difficult time for her.
     Importantly she noted that the Appellant has extensive family ties  in
    Mongolia and it was open to Mr Harland to visit.

18. She considered whether there were unjustifiably harsh consequences  for
    the Appellant or her spouse, even if they fell short  of  amounting  to
    insurmountable obstacles before a  decision  to  remove  the  Appellant
    would breach her protected rights, which is the  approach  set  out  in
    Agyarko.

19. For reasons stated she did not find the consequences amounted to  being
    unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for  either  the  Appellant  or  Mr
    Harland.  Her conclusion that  the  Appellant  could  apply  for  entry
    clearance is entirely rational and even if it is  possible  that  there
    might be a delay of some kind that would  be  entering  the  realms  of
    speculation.

20. It seems to me that the Appellant's case has been fully  considered  by
    the judge who did make very careful findings on all the material issues
    and it cannot  be  said  that  any  of  these  findings  are  wrong  or
    materially wrong in any way.  It is true that another judge might  have
    viewed the matter slightly differently (perhaps on whether  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles), but that is not remotely the same as  saying
    there is any error or material error by the judge  in  this  case.  The
    arguments put forward on the Appellant's behalf are very much based  on
    the proposition that on the agreed facts the judge could  have  allowed
    the appeal but while this is one of those cases where that  may  be  so
    that does not establish an error in law by the judge.

21. I have therefore decided that because the reasons given  by  the  judge
    are coherent, clear and open to her, that there is no error or material
    error in law. It follows that the judge's decision must stand.



Notice of Decision

22. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

23. I do not set aside the decision.



24. No anonymity order is made.
