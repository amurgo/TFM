For the Respondent:    No appearance

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Anstis promulgated on 23rd June 2016.  The appellant before me  is  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department and the respondent  to  this
    appeal, is Mr Ahmed.  However, for ease of reference, in the course  of
    this determination I shall adopt the parties' status as it  was  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  I shall in this decision, refer to  Mr  Ahmed
    as the appellant, and the Secretary of State as the respondent.


 2. The underlying decision that was the subject of the appeal  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal was  the  decision  of  the  respondent  dated  4th
    February 2015.  That was a Notice to a Person Liable to Removal in form
    IS.151A.  The  reason  for  the  respondent's  decision  was  that  the
    respondent considered the appellant to be a person who had sought leave
    to remain in the UK by  deception.   The  respondent  claims  that  for
    purposes of  an  application  dated  13th  March  2013,  the  appellant
    submitted a certificate from ETS to his sponsor in order  for  them  to
    provide him  with  a  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for  Studies.   ETS
    undertook a check of the test and  confirmed  to  the  respondent  that
    there was significant evidence to conclude  that  the  certificate  was
    fraudulently obtained by use of a proxy test taker. The scores from the
    test taken on 6th February 2013 at Queensway College, were cancelled by
    ETS.


 3. There was no appearance by or on behalf of  the  appellant  before  me.
    The hearing of the appeal was called on at just after 12:15pm after the
    clerk to the Tribunal had tried to contact the representatives that are
    on record as acting for the appellant, JS Solicitors.  The clerk to the
    Tribunal had been unable to establish contact  with  anyone  from  that
    firm by telephone.  Notice of the hearing listed before me was sent  to
    the parties on 29th November 2016.  It was sent to the appellant at  an
    address in London,  and  although  it  seems  that  the  appellant  has
    returned to Bangladesh, a copy of the  Notice  was  also  sent  to  his
    representatives.  I am satisfied that the appellant has received Notice
    of the Hearing.  No explanation for  the  absence  of  the  appellant's
    representatives has been provided to the Tribunal.


The decision of the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT")


 4. The FtT Judge sets out the background to the appeal at  paragraphs  [1]
    to [5] of the decision.  At paragraph [6],  the  Judge  identifies  the
    evidence, and at paragraphs  [7]  to  [30],  the  Judge  sets  out  the
    material evidence set out in the statements and  expert  report  before
    the FtT.   The Judge addresses the evidence at paragraphs [40] to  [57]
    of the decision.


 5. Although the Judge treats  the  evidence  of  Lesley  Singh  with  some
    caution, for the reasons identified at paragraphs [40] and [41] of  the
    decision, the Judge accepted  her  evidence  that  the  respondent  was
    notified by ETS that the appellant's test score  had  been  treated  at
    'invalid'.  Exhibited to the witness statement of Lesley Singh  was  an
    extract from a spreadsheet provided by ETS to the respondent confirming
    that ETS was treating the test completed by the appellant at  Queensway
    College on 6th February 2013, as invalid.


 6. The Judge also had available,  a  document  issued  by  the  respondent
    entitled "Project Fa�ade - Criminal inquiry into  abuse  of  the  TOIC"
    referring specifically  to  a  criminal  investigation  into  Queensway
    College.  The Judge states:


         "42. On the  face  of  it,  the  note  of  the  investigation  into
         Queensway College suggests that there were  very  serious  problems
         with the ETS tests at Queensway College in the period during  which
         the Appellant took his test.."


 7. At paragraphs [43] to [49] of the decision,  the  Judge  sets  out  the
    perceived problems with the note, and at paragraph [49] concludes:


         "49.  Whilst  apparently  suggesting  very  serious   problems   at
         Queensway College, I find that this evidence raises more  questions
         than answers. It is crying out for an explanation as  to  what  ETS
         did or did not do, an update on what, if any,  further  steps  have
         been taken in the investigation, and also  whether  there  was  any
         evidence suggesting honesty in testing at  Queensway  College.  The
         lack of this causes me to treat this evidence with great  caution."




 8. At paragraphs [50] to [52] of the decision,  the  Judge  addresses  the
    generic evidence of Peter Millington that was considered by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in SM and Qadir.  The  Judge  notes  that  that  evidence  was
    subject to some criticism in SM and Qadir and  at  paragraph  [53]  the
    Judge states:


         "53. I do not consider Rebecca Collings's statement  to  contribute
         substantially  to  the  Respondent's  case.  It  contains   helpful
         background and contextual information, but suffers  from  the  same
         difficulties as Mr  Millington's  in  that  it  relies  largely  on
         information and assurances given by ETS..."


 9. At paragraphs [54], the  Judge  addresses  the  evidence  of  Professor
    French.  The Judge accepted, in principle, his conclusion that  if  the
    process was as ETS said  it  was,  then  there  would,  after  listener
    verification, have been more false  rejections  than  false  positives.
    However, the Judge noted that this does depend on matters being as  ETS
    say they are, and there is much that remains unknown about exactly what
    training and audit processes were adopted by ETS.


10. At paragraphs [55] to [57] of the decision,  the  Judge  addresses  the
    evidence of the appellant.  The Judge accepts at paragraph  [56],  that
    the  appellant's  evidence  does    not  contain   detail   about   the
    circumstances in which he took the test, but did  not  think  that  the
    absence  of  that  detail  is  something  that  undermines,  or  should
    otherwise lead the Judge to doubt his evidence. The Judge accepted what
    the appellant had said about his education in Bangladesh and about  his
    educational achievements in the UK.


11. The conclusions of the Judge are found at paragraphs [58]  to  [63]  of
    the decision.  Having  weighed  up  all  of  the  evidence,  the  Judge
    concluded that the appellant's specific and apparently honest and first-
    hand account that he did not cheat must prevail in  this  case  against
    the generic and second-hand evidence concerning ETS's checking methods.
     The Judge noted at paragraph [63] that the  evidence  in  relation  to
    Queensway College certainly reveals what appear to be  very  suspicious
    circumstances, but the deficiencies in that evidence, mean that it does
    not weigh heavily against the appellant.


The appeal before me


  12. The respondent advances one ground of appeal.  That is, the FtT  Judge
      failed to make rational, adequate or adequately reasoned findings, and
      that the findings made, were not open to the  Judge  on  the  evidence
      produced.  The respondent submits that the  Judge  failed  to  provide
      adequate  reasons  for  the  finding  at  paragraph  [63]   that   the
      appellant's specific and apparently honest and first-hand account that
      he did not cheat, must prevail against  the  generic  and  second-hand
      evidence concerning ETS's checking methods.  The respondent refers  to
      the evidence that was before the Judge in  the  form  of  the  witness
      statements from Lesley Singh, Peter Millington  and  Rebecca  Collins.
      The respondent submits that  read  properly,  the  evidence  of  Peter
      Millington and Rebecca Collins establishes that a test  score  is  not
      categorised as "invalid" until the test has gone  through  a  computer
      programme analysing speech, and then two independent  voice  analysts.
      It is only if all three agree, that a proxy has been  used,  that  the
      test is categorised as 'invalid'.


  13. The  respondent  refers  to  the  evidence  of  Professor  French  who
      concluded that there would have been a large reduction in  the  number
      of false positives because of human verifiers who are able  to  assess
      variables excluded from analysis by the ASR software.   The respondent
      also refers to the evidence of Professor French that the large  number
      of rejected matches by  trained  listeners,  indicates  that  the  ETS
      system was robust.  Only 57.7% of matches (of the  58,464  identified)
      were accepted by trained listeners, demonstrating  that  ETS  employed
      the criminal standard, in  assessing  whether  a  match  was  invalid.
      Staff had to be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt before declaring
      a match.  The respondent submits that Professor French found  that  if
      the 2% error rate established for the TOEFL recordings were  to  apply
      to the TOEIC ones, then he would estimate it as less  than  1%,  after
      the assessment by trained listeners.


  14. The respondent recognises that in SM and  Qadir,  the  Upper  Tribunal
      concluded that every case  belonging  to  the  ETS/TOEIC  stable  will
      invariably be fact sensitive and that every appeal will be  determined
      on the basis of the evidence adduced by the parties.   The  respondent
      submits that it in the case of the first appellant in  SM  and  Qadir,
      there was full evidence of how the test was taken, and  of  the  steps
      taken by the appellant on being told that the test was invalid.  Here,
      there was simply a bare denial by the appellant.


  15. The respondent submits  that  it  was  incumbent  upon  the  Judge  to
      properly consider the expert evidence of Professor French as a  whole,
      and his opinion as to the reliability of  the  conclusion  reached  by
      ETS, that the test was 'invalid'.


  16. Permission to appeal was granted by FtT Judge Page  on  23rd  November
      2016.  The matter comes before me to consider whether the decision  of
      the FtT involved the making of a material error of law, and if so,  to
      remake the decision.


  17. Before me, Ms Isherwood submits that the decision  of  the  FtT  Judge
      discloses a material error of law.  She adopts the matters set out  in
      the grounds of appeal and submits that although a  detailed  decision,
      the Judge erred in stating at paragraph [59] of the decision that  the
      respondent has not cast doubt on the appellant's general  credibility,
      and thus treating the appellant as an apparently honest witness.   She
      submits that the credibility of the appellant is at the  core  of  the
      decision because the respondent's decision proceeds on the basis  that
      the appellant is a person who had sought leave to remain in the UK  by
      deception.  That is a  direct  challenge  by  the  respondent  to  the
      credibility of the appellant, and the appellant's very vague evidence,
      as set out at paragraph [28] of the  decision,  could  not  rationally
      have overcome the evidence relied  upon  by  the  respondent  in  this
      appeal.  She submits that the error particularly manifests  itself  in
      the conclusions of the Judge at paragraph [63], in which  it  is  said
      that "I consider that the Appellant's specific and  apparently  honest
      and first-hand account that he did not  cheat  must  prevail  in  this
      case, against the generic and second-hand  evidence  concerning  ETS's
      checking methods....".  She submits that the Judge failed to  properly
      consider the  evidence  of  the  expert,  Professor  French,  who  had
      prepared his report to give an opinion as to whether, on  the  balance
      of probabilities, ETS's methodology was likely to result in any  false
      positives  (i.e.  speaker  comparison  test  results  indicating  that
      different speakers are same  person),  and  if  false  positives  were
      likely, to estimate how many.


  18. It is now well established that what is required in a decision is that
      the reasons provided must give sufficient detail to show  the  parties
      and the appellate  Tribunal,  the  principles  upon  which  the  lower
      Tribunal has acted, and the reasons that led it to  its  decision,  so
      that they are able to understand why  it  reached  its  decision.  The
      reasons need not be elaborate, and need not deal with  every  argument
      presented.


  19. In SM and Qadir, the Tribunal had before it the witness statements  of
      Peter Millington and Rebecca Collings  in  the  form  that  they  were
      presented to the FtT here.  A Presidential panel of the Tribunal in SM
      and Qadir, at [91],  described  the  respondent's  case  against  both
      appellants as "non-specific and generalised".  This contrasts with the
      present appeal in which  the  production  of  further  evidence,  both
      general and specific, was available to the  Judge.  Here,  there  was,
      inter alia, clear prima facie evidence of what the Judge describes  at
      paragraph [63] as "very suspicious circumstances" concerning the tests
      undertaken at Queensway  College,  London.  The  Judge  also  had  the
      evidence of Lesley Singh.  The  Judge  accepted,  at  [41],  that  the
      respondent was notified by ETS that  the  appellant's  test  had  been
      treated as 'invalid' by ETS. Furthermore, the  Judge  had  the  expert
      evidence as to whether ETS's methodology was likely to result in false
      positives.


  20. In SM and Qadir, the following was stated by the Upper Tribunal;:


         102. We take this  opportunity  to  re-emphasise  that  every  case
         belonging  to  the  ETS/TOEIC  stable  will  invariably   be   fact
         sensitive.  To this we add that every appeal will be determined  on
         the basis of the evidence adduced by the parties."


  21. This was confirmed in the statement of Beatson LJ in  SSHD  v  Shehzad
      and Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615, at [23]:


         "I do not address the question of what evidence will be  sufficient
         to enable a Tribunal to conclude that there has been no  deception.
         That is likely to be an intensely fact-specific matter."


  22. At [30] Beatson LJ said: regarding the issue of  burden  of  proof  in
      Shehzad and Chowdhury, at [30].


         ".....   In  circumstances  where  the  generic  evidence  is   not
         accompanied  by  evidence  showing  that   the   individual   under
         considerations test was categorised as 'invalid', I  consider  that
         the Secretary of  State  faces  a  difficulty  in  respect  of  the
         evidential burden at the initial stage."


  23.  At  paragraph  [58]  of  the  decision,  the  Judge  found  that  the
      respondent's  evidence  is  sufficient  to  discharge  the  evidential
      burden.  The Judge  also  found  that  the  appellant  has  raised  an
      innocent explanation that satisfies the minimum level of  plausibility
      such as to cause the Judge to  consider  whether  the  respondent  has
      shown, on the balance of probabilities, that the appellant cheated  in
      his test.


  24. The appellant did not give evidence at the hearing before the FtT. The
      Judge refers to the evidence set out in the witness statement  of  the
      appellant at paragraph [28] of the  decision.  The  question  for  the
      Judge was whether the respondent had discharged the burden on  her  to
      show, on the balance of probabilities, and when measured  against  the
      appellant's evidence,  that  he  cheated.   The  Judge  resolved  that
      question in favour of the appellant,  but  did  so,  in  the  mistaken
      belief that the respondent did  not  cast  doubt  on  the  appellant's
      general credibility.


  25. The Judge notes that  the  evidence  relied  upon  by  the  respondent
      highlights that there remain unanswered  questions  and  uncertainties
      relating in particular to systems, processes and procedures concerning
      the ETS testing, and the subsequent testing of scores.


  26. However, the Judge treated the appellant as an  honest  witness  whose
      general credibility was said not to be challenged by  the  respondent.
      The Judge concluded that the deficiencies in the respondent's evidence
      were such that  the  appellant's  apparently  honest,  and  first-hand
      account that he did not cheat, must prevail against  the  generic  and
      second-hand evidence concerning ETS's checking methods.  The Judge did
      so in the mistaken belief that the respondent did not  cast  doubt  on
      the appellant's general credibility.  I accept the submission made  by
      Ms Isherwood that the appellant's general credibility was at the heart
      of the appeal.  The Judge  was  required  to  assess  the  appellant's
      explanation in that light.  Had the Judge done  so,  it  is  far  from
      clear that the Judge would have reached the same conclusion and I find
      that the decision of the Judge is infected by a material error of  law
      and I set aside the decision.


  27. The decision needs to be re-made.  I  remind  myself  of  the  correct
      approach to the issue of burden  of  proof  and,  in  particular,  the
      "burden of proof boomerang"  discussed  in  Muhandiramge  (Section  S-
      LTR.1.7) [2015] UKUT 00675 (IAC), at [9] - [11].


  28.  At  paragraph  [58]  of  the  decision,  the  Judge  found  that  the
      respondent's  evidence  is  sufficient  to   discharge   the   initial
      evidential burden.  Whilst most of  that  which  is  set  out  on  the
      witness  statements  of  Peter  Millington  and  Rebecca  Collins,  is
      generic, the evidence of Lesley Singh establishes that the test  score
      of the appellant is being treated by ETS as invalid.   The  respondent
      is entitled to rely upon the evidence provided to her by  ETS  showing
      the appellant's ETS certificate  to  have  been  invalidated  by  ETS.
      Details of how that decision was  reached  is  in  witness  statements
      relied upon by the respondent.  There is evidence from  ETS  that  the
      appellant himself  has  been  individually  identified  as  having  an
      invalid test result.   In  this  case,  ETS  has  itself  invalidated,
      following a thorough analysis, the appellants  ETS  test  certificate.
      If the certificate is withdrawn or invalidated by ETS there is  simply
      no basis for the respondent to simply  disregard  that  withdrawal  or
      invalidation.


  29. The evidence of Peter Millington  establishes  that  the  decision  is
      reached with not only voice biometric technology being  deployed,  but
      also an independent check by two analysts, one of whom is experienced,
      working separately.


  30. The document relied upon by the respondent entitled "Project Fa�ade  -
      Criminal inquiry into abuse of the  TOIC"  refers  specifically  to  a
      criminal investigation into Queensway College, the  college  at  which
      the appellant claims to have  sat  his  test.   Project  Fa�ade  is  a
      nationwide criminal inquiry into the abuse of the TOEIC exam. As  part
      of this inquiry, 21 separate criminal investigations are taking  place
      into specific test centres which have been prioritised according to  a
      number of factors. Queensway College is identified as  one  such  test
      centre.  The criminal inquiry has revealed  that  of  the  2793  TOEIC
      speaking and writing tests completed at Queensway College between 20th
      March 2012 and 5th February 2014, 70% have been identified by  ETS  as
      invalid.  The test relied upon by the appellant was  completed  during
      this period.


  31. The information relating to  the  criminal  inquiry  refers  to  three
      audits and a search carried out  at  Queensway  College.   Information
      relating to two of the audits is provided.  Evidence of remote testing
      was seen during an audit on 16th April  2013  and  on  17th  September
      2013, a secret room was identified  where  'pilots'  (imposters)  were
      taking speaking and writing tests on behalf  of  the  candidates  that
      were located in the examination room.  During a search  on  25th  June
      2014, documents relating to TOEIC exams were  discovered  relating  to
      tests  taken  between  19th  March  2013  and  3rd  April  2013,  that
      identified twenty-six candidates with  further  names  alongside  them
      that are labelled 'pilots' and 'agents'.  The document also notes that
      ETS voice samples were compared with the voices of 13 candidates  that
      had been interviewed under caution. None of them were the  same.   The
      voice analysis therefore shows  evidence  of  widespread  cheating  at
      Queensway College.


  32.  Professor French was instructed by the respondent to give an  opinion
      as to whether, on the balance of probabilities, ETS's methodology  was
      likely to result in any false positives i.e. speaker  comparison  test
      results indicating that different speakers are  same  person.   If  he
      considered false positives were likely, he was asked to  estimate  how
      many.


  33. Professor French begins from the premise that  all  automatic  speaker
      recognition (ASR) systems make errors.  He is of the view that the ASR
      used by ETS is extremely likely to have produced some false  positives
      among the 58,464 matches identified to software in  respect  of  TOEIC
      test recordings.   He  states  that  the  number  of  false  positives
      produced by the ASR, however,  cannot  be  estimated  with  any  great
      degree of precision.   In  his  witness  statement,  Peter  Millington
      refers to the testing  of  the  technology  by  ETS  in  2012/13  with
      representative data which deliberately included 285  pairs  of  repeat
      test takers where it was already known they  were  recordings  of  the
      same person. ETS wanted to know whether the technology could  identify
      occasions where,  within  one  test  centre,  there  was  evidence  of
      multiple tests being taken by the  same  person  (or  people  who  had
      already been identified as imposters). The results of the  pilot  were
      that matching samples produced values that  were  higher  than  values
      from the non-matching samples the majority of the time,  with  a  less
      than 2% error rate.  In his report, Professor French  notes  that  the
      error rate of 2% quoted for the pilot tests is not  broken  down  into
      false positives versus false negatives. However, in his opinion,  even
      if one assumes the worst case' scenario,  that  all  the  errors  were
      false positives, then  the  'safety  net'  system  of  having  trained
      listeners assess all the matches thrown up by the ASR would have  made
      a very large reduction to the overall number of false positives.   The
      reasons why Professor French is of the opinion that it reviews of  the
      ASR matches by trained listeners would result in a large reduction  to
      the overall number of false positives, are set out at section 3.3.1 of
      his report.


  34. Since the witness statement of Peter Millington  was  first  provided,
      ETS has confirmed that the ASR system  identified  58,464  matches  of
      which just 33,735 were confirmed by the listener pairs.  That is, only
      57.7% of the  matches  were  accepted.   This  57.7%  referred  to  by
      Professor French is of  course  at  odds  with  the  much  higher  80%
      referred to by Peter Millington  in  his  statement.   However,  Peter
      Millington was working from the rough and ready figure of "over  33,00
      possible matches", whereas Professor French refers to  the  much  more
      specific and focused information that has come from ETS in response to
      questions raised by the respondent.    Although the 57.7% set  out  by
      Professor French is considerably lower than the 80%  set  out  in  the
      generic statement of Peter Millington, Professor French  presumes  the
      very high rejection rate  (42.3%)  is  in  part  attributable  to  the
      stringent conditions laid down for match  confirmation  by  listeners.
      That  is,  for  acceptance  of  a   match   both   listeners   working
      independently  had  to  confirm  it,  and  the  test  for   individual
      acceptance was that 'any doubt about the  validity  of  a  match  will
      result in it being rejected.


  35. Overall, Professor French  concludes  that  the  conditions  used  for
      trained listener pair confirmation, in conjunction  with  the  (albeit
      unspecified) conservative thresholds set for ASR match identification,
      would,  in  his  view,  have  resulted  in  substantially  more  false
      rejections than false positives. Furthermore, if  the  2%  error  rate
      established for the TOEFL pilot recordings were to apply to the  TOEIC
      recordings, then he would estimate the rate of false positives  to  be
      very substantially less than 1%, after the process  of  assessment  by
      trained listeners had been applied.


  36. I acknowledge that the respondent's evidence if far  from  conclusive.
      There  remain  unanswered  questions  and  uncertainties  relating  in
      particular to the systems, processes and  procedures,  concerning  the
      TOEIC testing, and the subsequent allocation of scores and  the  later
      conduct and activities of ETS.  However,  I  remind  myself  that  the
      standard of proof is a simple balance of probabilities,  and  requires
      neither absolute certainty nor infallibility.


  37. I am satisfied that  the  respondent  has  discharged  the  evidential
      burden  of  establishing  that  the  appellant  procured   his   TOEIC
      certificate by deception.


  38. The appellant's evidence takes the form of a witness statement.   That
      evidence falls to be  considered  in  conjunction  with  the  evidence
      adduced relied upon by the respondent.


  39. I have carefully  considered  the  matters  set  out  in  the  witness
      statement of the appellant.  The appellant maintains that he  had  sat
      the ETS test and that another person  or  proxy  test  taker  had  not
      completed the  test.   The  appellant's  evidence  is  that  from  his
      childhood he was taught in an Oxford International School and that all
      the subjects were taught in English.   He  states  that  he  has  been
      studying in English and that there was no need for him to use a proxy.
       The material evidence of the appellant is set out at paragraphs  [28]
      and [29] of the decision of the FtT.


  40. It is right to note that there are significant gaps in the appellant's
      witness statement and, related to this, a complete failure to  provide
      even the most  basic  description  of  the  tests  that  he  completed
      including, when, where and in what circumstances.  There is simply the
      barest of claims that the appellant had sat the ETS test, and that the
      appellant had been taught in English since his childhood in an  Oxford
      International School.


  41. As the Tribunal has recognised, in the abstract, there are a range  of
      reasons why persons otherwise proficient  in  English  may  engage  in
      TOEIC fraud.  These include, inter alia, lack of confidence,  fear  of
      failure, lack of time and commitment and contempt for the  immigration
      system.


  42. The appellant has raised an innocent explanation but noting as I have,
      the significant gaps in the appellant's evidence in material respects,
      when weighed against the various strands of the evidence  relied  upon
      by the respondent, both generic and specific, I am satisfied that  the
      respondent has discharged the burden upon her of establishing that the
      appellant had sought leave to remain in the UK by deception.


  43. It follows that I re-make the decision, and  dismiss  the  appellant's
      appeal
