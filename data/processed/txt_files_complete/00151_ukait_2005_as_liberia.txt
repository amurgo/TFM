                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

(This case is reported only for the point in the keyword: see � 10.)

   This is a case where permission was given the Home Office to appeal from
   a decision of an adjudicator (Mr RG Handley), sitting at  North  Shields
   on 4 May 2004, allowing an asylum and human rights appeal by  a  citizen
   of Liberia. Under the transitional provisions of the 2004 Act, the  case
   proceeds as if it were a reconsideration following review by the  Asylum
   and Immigration Tribunal; but only (see r. 62.7 of  the  2005  Procedure
   Rules) on the grounds on which permission was given. These were that the
   adjudicator's conclusions were inadequately reasoned, especially  as  to
   the availability of internal flight: essentially the argument before  us
   was that they were speculative.

2. The adjudicator gives the relevant individual history at �� 6-9. In 2001
   LURD rebels had attacked the appellant's village, killing  his  parents.
   He escaped, but returned the following day and was  caught;  however  he
   was released after a week. On reaching government-controlled  territory,
   he was arrested on suspicion of  being  a  rebel  or  collaborator,  but
   released after he had given information about  the  whereabouts  of  his
   previous captors. He went back to his uncle's, where he continued, under
   pressure, to  provide  government  forces  with  information  about  the
   rebels. Again the rebels started attacking the appellant's village,  and
   in January 2003 caught him and kept him in  a  cell  till  two  of  them
   brought him out and told him he  was  to  be  executed.  Nonetheless  he
   managed to escape, with gunshot wounds, to another village, where he was
   looked after till his host began to fear for his own safety. In  October
   2003 the appellant fled by air to  Sierra  Leone,  and  thence  here  in
   December.

3. At �� 44-45 and 47 the adjudicator accepts that history, in the light of
   the background evidence and the medical evidence before him. There is no
   difficulty about that; but one is raised by his �� 46 and 50,  which  go
   on to draw conclusions  on  it.  At  �  46  the  adjudicator  begins  by
   accepting the plausibility of the  appellant  having  been  detained  by
   government forces as a suspected rebel, with information of possible use
   to them, having himself been detained by the rebels, if only for a short
   time; so far there is no challenge to his conclusions, but he goes on

   Given that the appellant was working in a plantation he would  have  had
   contact with large numbers of people and  would  be  in  a  position  to
   acquire information which could be passed to Government  soldiers.  When
   the rebels started attacking the village again,  it  is  plausible  that
   they would have accepted that the appellant collaborated with Government
   soldiers. The appellant was asked at the Hearing how  the  rebels  would
   have known that he was passing information to Government  soldiers.  The
   appellant did not attempt to offer any  explanation  and  simply  stated
   that he didn't know.  However  he  did  suggest  that  they  might  have
   received this from relatives or others.

4. The adjudicator gives his own conclusions on that at � 50:

   I accept that in general it would  be  safe  for  many  refugees  to  be
   returned [sc. to Monrovia] However  the  appellant  worked  in  a  large
   plantation where he came into contact with a large number of people.  It
   is likely that some of those people he worked with were  aware  that  he
   was passing information to Government soldiers.

   The adjudicator does not explain exactly why this  should  now  put  the
   appellant  at  risk  in  government-controlled   territory;   but   that
   conclusion is supported by  Miss  McRae  with  reference  to  background
   evidence. First there is the extract from Amnesty International's annual
   report on Liberia, 25 May 2005, which refers to

   ... power struggles  within  the  National  Transitional  Government  of
   Liberia, which comprised representatives of  the  former  government  of
   Liberia and of the two armed opposition  groups,  Liberians  United  for
   Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) and the Movement  for  Democracy  in
   Liberia (MODEL), as well as by internal leadership disputes  within  the
   LURD.

5. Then there are further references in the  Human  Rights  Watch  briefing
   paper of 30 September 2005: both of these reports date  from  after  the
   adjudicator's decision, but, as we told Miss McCrae,  we  were  entirely
   prepared to look at them on the basis that anything they said about  the
   continuing situation was capable of supporting that. What  Human  Rights
   Watch say (at pp 9-10 of their paper) is this:

   The 1996 peace accord granted a general amnesty to faction fighters  for
   abuses committed "in the course of actual military  engagements."  Those
   responsible for committing some of the worst atrocities during  the  war
   were neither punished for their actions nor effectively demobilized. For
   the next six years at least, former faction fighters -  particularly  of
   [former President Charles] Taylor's faction, the NPFL - continued to act
   with impunity and remained a  serious  impediment  to  continued  peace.
   Human Rights Watch believes that the failure to adequately [sic]  ensure
   justice for past crimes had catastrophic consequences for civilians  and
   greatly contributed to Liberia's failed transition in 1997.

   In Liberia currently, the continued existence of the command and control
   structures of the former  factions  means  that  former  commanders  can
   mobilize ex-fighters quickly. The continued impunity of those commanders
   who committed or organized the most serious atrocities  during  the  war
   could well serve to embolden them and  undermine  Liberia's  chances  of
   lasting peace and stability.

   Since at least 1980, Liberian police officers were  reputed  to  be  not
   only corrupt but also prone to commit  criminal  acts  against  Liberian
   citizens. During both wars, members of the Liberian  police,  especially
   those within special elite police units, were frequently involved in the
   targeting and  repression  of  civilians  accused  of  supporting  armed
   insurgencies.

   There is further evidence at p 12 about the number  of  police  officers
   and applicants negatively reported on for  their  past  conduct  by  the
   United Nations Mission in Liberia [UNMIL] human rights section  (large),
   and the number disqualified for human rights abuses by UNMIL's  civilian
   police component [CIVPOL].

6. The adjudicator's conclusions, taken together with his findings  on  the
   appellant's evidence, depend on the assumptions that he would

     a) while working in the up-country plantation from  2001-03,  have  had
        information of interest to Government soldiers; and
     b)  would  in  early  2003  have  been  suspected  by  the  rebels   of
        collaborating with them; and
     c) would still in late 2005 be the object of their ire and  malevolence
        over it; and
     d) would, despite the current preoccupations of the LURD,  incur  their
        active hostility over it in Monrovia.

   As both the appellant and the adjudicator  acknowledged,  there  was  no
   evidence at all of how the rebels might have developed their suspicions,
   which the adjudicator derives from the fact of the appellant working  on
   a plantation, apparently with many others. There is no  suggestion  that
   he was interrogated in any way following his capture in  the  attack  on
   his village in January 2003, so nothing to show that what was apparently
   a bungled attempt to shoot him was an act of vengeance directed  against
   him personally,  rather  than  simply  part  of  the  general  notorious
   savagery of the Liberian civil war.

7. We do not see any evidence to support the adjudicator's conclusions that
   the appellant would now be at real risk  in  Monrovia,  even  from  LURD
   elements now taking part in the transitional government there.  Even  if
   there were any basis for them to be ill-disposed to him at  the  present
   time, none of the background evidence to which we were referred by  Miss
   McCrae suggests that those elements have had either the liberty  or  the
   inclination (in the course of whatever power struggles may be going  on)
   to settle old scores. The  Human  Rights  Watch  report  is  essentially
   dealing with the failure to deal with past events, not with any  present
   risk.


8. When we announced this decision, we asked Miss McCrae whether there were
   any reason why we should not proceed to determine  the  appeal  (as  Mrs
   Aslan had made clear she would  invite  us  to  do).  The  only  further
   consideration cited by Miss  McCrae  involved  the  appellant's  current
   medical condition. Whereas  at  the  date  of  the  hearing  before  the
   immigration judge his  gunshot  wounds  had  left  him  "...  with  some
   residual disability and some slight mobility problems"  (see  letter  Dr
   Olufunwa 14 January 2004), for  which  a  reference  to  an  orthopaedic
   surgeon had been recommended, this had now taken place. The  result,  so
   far, was a letter  from  Mr  RJ  Montgomery  (a  consultant  orthopaedic
   surgeon, though he does not give his qualifications), which Miss  McCrae
   faxed down to us at our request, saying the appellant was

   ...at present  undergoing  lengthy  and  rather  complicated  corrective
   surgery ...It would certainly make no sense at all to send him home half
   way through his treatment. Hopefully at the end of the treatment he will
   have a limb that is back towards its normal  length  and  alignment.  It
   will be weak to start with and it will be a rather long and hard job  to
   try and regain the range of movement  in  his  knee,  which  has  become
   rather stiff. I would  expect  therefore  a  fairly  lengthy  course  of
   physiotherapy after the external fixator frame has been  removed,  which
   will probably be towards the end of the year or early next year.

9. The result of that process seems likely to be that the appellant may  be
   left with some limitations on his use of his  leg,  but  that  they  are
   unlikely to be significant, provided he  is  allowed  to  complete  that
   course of physiotherapy. Clearly there can be no  question  of  removing
   him before the frame is removed, and we do not  think  any  humane  Home
   Office would  do  so,  as  long  as  he  is  co-operating  with  regular
   physiotherapy advised by a consultant surgeon: so much for the practical
   aspect.

10. On the jurisprudential side, the appellant's medical condition  was  not
   relied on before the immigration judge as showing that it  would  amount
   to "inhuman or degrading treatment" to return him to Liberia; but simply
   on the credibility (which was accepted) of his account  of  how  he  got
   away from the rebels. If the former were to be treated as an independent
   reason for affirming her decision, then in our view it  needed  to  have
   been raised no later than five days before the hearing, by way of  reply
   under r. 30.1 of the 2005 Procedure Rules (required where a  party  "...
   contends that the Tribunal should uphold the initial  determination  for
   reasons different from or additional to those given in the determination
   ...".

11. It follows that the appellant's appeal  is  dismissed,  subject  to  the
   note of caution about when he ought to be removed. If his treatment does
   not progress as expected, it will be open  to  him  to  make  a  further
   application to the Home Office.

The original Tribunal made a material error of law and  the  above  decision
is accordingly substituted.
