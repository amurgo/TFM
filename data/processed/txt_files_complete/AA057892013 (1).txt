                                   Before

                 THE PRESIDENT, THE HON MR JUSTICE MCCLOSKEY
                         UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE LATTER


                                   Between

                         MR SRIRAM THIRUVAMPALAMAYAM
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

Appellant:    Mr Derana, Liyon Legal Ltd

Respondent:   Mr Cooper, Home Office Presenting Officer


                                DETERMINATION


 1. Very properly, there is no objection on behalf of the  Respondent,  the
    Secretary of State of the Home Department, to an order of this Tribunal
    setting aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as  erroneous  in
    law and we so order. The operative error of law consists of the judge's
    failure to properly consider the medical evidence.

 2. Secondly, we exercise our power under rule 15 of the  Procedural  Rules
    to admit the fresh evidence contained in the Appellant's bundle.

 3. Having taking into account the significant alteration in the  framework
    and content of the Appellant's case, the nature and impact of the error
    of law and the Practice Statement, we have determined that  as  regards
    the remaking of the decision it would be more appropriate to remit  the
    appeal to the First- tier Tribunal.   Accordingly we remit  the  matter
    to a differently constituted First-tier Tribunal.

 4. We give no  procedural  directions,  leaving  this  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.


Decision

5.   We set aside the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  allow
    the appeal to the extent of remitting the matter to that forum for  the
    purpose of remaking the decision.


Signed :                            Date: 5 December 2013
