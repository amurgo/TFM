                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

There was no application for anonymity in this case.


Respondent: There was no appearance by or behalf of the Respondent.   I  was
satisfied that the requisite notice of hearing had been served on  the  Home
Office.  There is on file no satisfactory  explanation  for  the  Respondent
absence simply an email dated 30 January 2018 notifying  the  tribunal  that
there would be  'No  PO'  in  the  court  for  this  list  .  There  was  an
application for an adjournment. Given the absence  of  any  explanation  for
why no HOPO was able to present the list  and  when  the  Respondent  became
aware of this I refused the adjournment. I took into account that  the  case
before  appeared  to  be  relatively  straightforward  and  the   overriding
objecting to deal with cases  fairly  and  justly  avoiding  delay  wherever
possible.


The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 31 March  1991.The  Appellant
is appealing against the decision of the Respondent made on 23  August  2017
to refuse to grant an EEA Residence Card by  virtue  of  European  Community
Law as the spouse of a European Economic Area national namely Daniela  Cioca
who he claimed was exercising rights of free movement under  the  treaty  of
Rome in the United Kingdom.


The refusal was on the basis that the requirements of Regulations 2  of  the
Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006('The  Regulations')
were not met.


Regulation 7 sets out which family  members  are  considered  to  be  family
members of an EEA national and therefore entitled to apply for  a  residence
card. The definition includes the spouse of an  EEA  national  except  where
the marriage is a marriage of convenience.


The Notice of Refusal indicates that the Respondent was not  satisfied  that
the  Appellant  fulfilled  the  requirements   of   the   Regulations.   The
Respondent's reasons can be summarised as follows:-


    a) There were significant inconsistencies and conflicting answers in the
       marriage interview which took place on 23 August 2017 following their
       marriage on 3 October 2016.


  The Law


In Rosa [2016] EWCA Civ it was held that the legal burden was  on  the  SSHD
to prove that an otherwise valid marriage was a marriage of  convenience  so
as to justify the refusal of a residence card  under  the  EEA  Regulations.
The legal burden of proof in relation to marriage lay on  the  Secretary  of
State, but if she adduced evidence capable of  pointing  to  the  conclusion
that the marriage was one of convenience, the evidential burden  shifted  to
the applicant (paras 24 -  27).   In  case  of  Miah(interviewers  comments:
disclosure: fairness)[2014] UKUT 00515(IAC) the President  of  the  Tribunal
summarised the law as set out  in  Papajorgji  (EEA  spouse  -  marriage  of
convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038(IAC) stating that :

       "However there is an evidential burden on  the  Claimant  to  address
       evidence  justifying  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  marriage   in
       question was undertaken  for  the  predominant  purpose  of  securing
       residence rights"

The  2016  regulations  (reg  2)  now  define  a  marriage  of  convenience:
"marriage of convenience" includes a marriage entered into for  the  purpose
of using  these  Regulations,  or  any  other  right  conferred  by  the  EU
treaties, as a means to circumvent - (a) immigration rules applying to  non-
EEA nationals (such as any applicable requirement  under  the  1971  Act  to
have leave to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom);  or  (b)  any  other
criteria that the party to the marriage of convenience would otherwise  have
to meet in order to enjoy a right to reside under these Regulations  or  the
EU treaties."


In relation to this issue I have also taken into  account  Sadovska  v  SSHD
[2017] UKSC 54  that  the  objective  to  obtain  the  right  of  entry  and
residence must be the predominant purpose for the  marriage  to  be  one  of
convenience and a marriage could not be  considered  to  be  a  marriage  of
convenience simply because it brought  an  immigration  advantage.   "Should
the tribunal conclude that Mr Malik was delighted to  find  an  EU  national
with whom he could form a relationship and who was  willing  to  marry  him,
that does not necessarily mean  that  their  marriage  was  a  "marriage  of
convenience" still less that Ms Sadovska was abusing her rights in  entering
into it".


In relation to the absent marriage interview  record  I  take  into  account
what was said in Miah (interviewer's comments: disclosure: fairness)  [2014]
UKUT 00515 ( a case concerning a false marriage in an EEA  appeal)   it  was
held that the  respondent's  decision  making  process  included  a  process
whereby comments, or opinions, of an interviewing officer were  conveyed  to
the decision maker. In the generality of  cases,  this  practice  would  not
contaminate the fairness of the decision making process.  The  duty  of  the
decision maker was to approach and consider all of  the  materials  with  an
open mind and with circumspection. The due discharge of this  duty,  coupled
with the statutory right of appeal, would provide the subject with  adequate
protection. However, the document enshrining the  interviewer's  comments  -
Form ICV.4605 - must be disclosed as a  matter  of  course.  An  appellant's
right to a fair  hearing  dictated  this  course.  If,  exceptionally,  some
legitimate concern about disclosure, for example, the protection of a  third
party, should arise, this should be proactively brought to the attention  of
the Tribunal, for a ruling and directions. In  this  way  the  principle  of
independent judicial adjudication would provide adequate safeguards for  the
appellant. This would also enable mechanisms such  as  redaction,  which  in
practice one expected to arise with extreme rarity, to be considered.


In relation to the relevant date I have considered Boodhoo and another  (EEA
Regs: relevant evidence) [2013] UKUT  00346 (IAC) where it was held that  in
an EEA appeal, a tribunal has  power  to  consider  any  evidence  which  it
thinks relevant to the substance of the decision, including  evidence  which
concerns a matter arising after the date of the decision.


  Evidence


On the file I had the Respondents bundle. This  did  not  include  either  a
transcript of the marriage interview  in  this  case  or  the  interviewer's
comments. I had a copy of the reason for refusal letter. The  Appellant  put
in an appeal and a bundle of documents 1-128.


I also heard evidence from the Appellant and his wife and  and  adopted  the
contents of their statements confirming that they were true.


I asked both if they had mobile phones with  photographs  of  their  spouse.
Both  produced  their  mobile  phones  so  that  I   could   examine   their
photographs. Paul  Albert  also  attended  court  to  give  evidence  but  I
indicated that I did not need to hear from him.


  Final Submissions


In the absence of the HOPO I have  assumed  that  they  would  rely  on  the
reason for refusal letter.


On behalf of the Appellant Ms Faryl relied on the documentary  evidence  and
the oral evidence of the Appellant and his spouse.


  Findings


On balance and taking the evidence as a whole, I have reached the  following
findings


The Appellant is a 26 year old citizen of Pakistan who  has  applied  for  a
residence card by virtue of European Community Law as a confirmation of  his
right to reside in the United Kingdom as the spouse of an EEA national.


The key is whether there is whether this is a marriage of convenience  or  a
marriage undertaken purely to obtain a residence document  to  stay  in  the
UK.


I heard brief evidence from the Appellant and his wife and found both to  be
credible witnesses.


The Appellant came to the  UK  as  a  student  with  a  visa  issued  on  15
September 2013 that expired on 6 September 2016.  He  was  studying  for  an
Honours Degree in Law at BPP (which  he  had  almost  completed)  and  on  3
September 2016 he made  an  application  for  a  residence  card  which  was
refused. He gave evidence that his application for further leave  under  the
Immigration Rules was in the hands of BPP being process and  as  far  as  he
understood there was no reasons why  he  would  not  be  granted  a  further
period of leave in order to complete  his  degree.  On  29  March  2017  the
Appellant made a further application for a residence card  and  it  was  the
refusal of that application that is the subject of this appeal.


There is no challenge to  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  and  sponsor  are
legally married as I have a copy of their marriage certificate at pages  14-
18 of the Appellants Bundle (AB). There is evidence on file that they  lived
together and continue to do so at a common address.  I  remind  myself  that
the legal burden is on the Respondent  to  prove  that  an  otherwise  valid
marriage was a marriage of convenience so as to justify  the  refusal  of  a
residence card under the EEA Regulations. The reasons for refusal are  based
on alleged inconsistencies in the  marriage  interviews.  I  have  not  been
provided with a copy of the marriage interviews or indeed  the  interviewers
comments as required by Miah only  summaries  of  those  matters  which  are
alleged  to  be  such  inconsistent  answers  in  the  refusal  letter.  The
Respondent is required to produce copies of all the documents on which  they
wish to rely in the appeal. In the absence of such a transcript I am  unable
to  put  the  responses  given  in  any  kind  of  context:  were  these  12
inconsistencies  in  the  context  of  100  correct  answers  or  was  it  a
relatively short interview; what is the  level  of  detail  in  relation  to
those answers that are  correct  and  what  topics  are  addressed;  is  the
summary of the response by the Respondent a  fair  characterisation  of  the
answer given by the Appellant and Respondent; did the interviewee appear  to
understand the questions that were put  or  did  any  of  them  have  to  be
explained or re asked.


I take into account in  relation  to  the  Sponsor  that  she  attended  the
interview without an interpreter because  she  was  advised  by  a  previous
representative that given their apparent absence of  a  common  language  it
might undermine their case if she requested  an  interpreter.  This  was  of
course not entirely poor advice if the sponsor was unable to  speak  English
at all. I heard evidence from her in English  and  she  spoke  it  well  but
confirmed to me that she wanted the security  of  an  interpreter  in  court
with her (one had been requested) in case there were  any  issues  that  she
did  not  completely  understand  given  her  experience  in  the   marriage
interview where she found the  interviewer  was  aggressive,  had  a  strong
accent and did not explain the process. I may  have  been  able  to  resolve
some of these issues with an interview record: in  its  absence  and  having
heard from the Sponsor I found her claim credible.


In relation to the assertion that in the interview that the Sponsor did  not
know which  Pakistani  Language  the  Appellant  spoke  before  stating  she
thought it was Urdu is not an inconsistency rather a lack of knowledge  that
I do not find in the least surprising. It is alleged that the Appellant  was
unaware whether his wife went to college: he disputes this and  states  that
he clarified that his wife went to college but he was unsure if she went  to
University. I accept this explanation. In relation to when  they  registered
with a GP , whether it was together or they had previously registered  given
that they had both lived in the same area for some time prior to  moving  in
together I accept that it is likely they were  already  registered  as  they
now assert and any apparently different response given by  the  sponsor  was
due to language difficulties. There is a claimed inconsistency  in  relation
to the agreed fact that the Appellant attended  hospital  with  the  sponsor
for an ultrasound arising out  of  painful  periods:  given  the  amount  of
agreed detail as to her gynaecological  problems  and  how  it  was  treated
whether the GP sent her as she stated or they simply attended A and E  seems
to me a minor difference .


How they first met is set out and they agreed it was at  the  Printworks  in
Manchester when he was working and she was with friends when he  came  over:
I can discern little difference given that he states he  was  working  as  a
security guard standing outside a cinema which  was  right  next  to  a  bar
where she was having a drink with friends.  The  response  about  the  first
date again is largely agreed: they went to a Turkish  restaurant  and  there
is a discrepancy as to whether they went home on the  same  bus  given  they
lived in the same area  or  separately:  the  Appellant  suggests  that  the
sponsors claim they travelled separately may  have  been  an  interpretation
problem.  Whether they had help moving in together is explained at AB  A5  :
the Appellant states they largely did this together but on another  occasion
the Sponsor may have had help from the landlords son as he had  a  car.  The
account of the marriage proposal was  largely  consistent  in  a  number  of
details apart from whether the Appellant stated that Caf� Italia was a  bar:
the Appellant disputes saying this. In the absence of the  interview  record
I accept his account. The proposal of marriage account appears to  be  quite
convoluted even as summarised in the refusal letter: I am  not  prepared  to
consider any other claimed inconsistency in the absence of the record.


There is no challenge to  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  are
married but neither could remember  the  day  of  the  week  and  they  give
different accounts of the time although both agreed that  they  were  picked
up in the morning by taxi.


I do not find it surprising that the Sponsor could not  name  the  witnesses
given that they were friends of the Appellant.


The only other discrepancy that is unaddressed is that the Appellant  states
they stayed in each others homes before marriage and the Sponsor  says  they
didn't.


I do not accept that these responses  can  be  fairly  described  as  'major
discrepancies'  or  'significant  differences'.  Those  answers   that   are
discrepant are either relatively minor or reflect a  lack  of  knowledge  or
lack of  detail  about  matters  that  are  only  important  in  a  marriage
interview but there  are  also  instances  where  the  parties  dispute  the
claimed inconsistency because of the recorded answer. In the  absence  of  a
record of interview those matters which might be  able  to  be  resolved  by
looking at the  record  I  am  unable  to  resolve.  I  would  not  find  it
surprising that any genuinely married couple might not get 'full  marks'  in
a marriage interview. Looking at the interview in so far as  I  am  able  in
the absence of all those responses that the parties undoubtedly got right  I
am satisfied that this interview  was  insufficient  to  satisfy  the  legal
burden on the Respondent to establish that this was anything  other  than  a
genuine marriage.


Even if I were wrong about this I heard evidence from  both  Appellants  and
found them to be credible as to the nature of  their  relationship.  I  note
that there were a few photographs of their life together in  the  bundle.  I
asked both the Appellant and the Respondent in turn whether they had  photos
of their partner on their mobile phones and could I see them.  Both  readily
produced their phones. The Appellant had  numerous  photographs  of  himself
and his wife in various situations, in Manchester and  on  holidays  in  the
UK. They appeared relaxed and intimate in the photographs. The  Sponsor  had
hundreds of photographs on her phone going back  to  August  2016  when  she
first bought the phone: they appeared to be a couple in the photographs  not
just friends or people who shared accommodation, they are people  sharing  a
life.  After viewing the photographs,  I  am  satisfied  that  theirs  is  a
genuine relationship.


  Conclusion


I find that the Appellant has discharged the burden of proof on him to  show
that the terms regulation 2 of the Regulations are met.


No order for anonymity is made.


  DECISION


The appeal in respect of the EEA Regulations is allowed.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  fee  award
of the whole fee as I found that the marriage interview did not justify  the
refusal of the application.
