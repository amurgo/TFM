                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal, by the  and her two dependent children, against  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Clive  Broe),  sitting  at
    Birmingham on 16 September, to  an appeal by a citizen of  China,  born
    11 July 1973, against refusal of a family reunion visa  on  22  October
    2013, on the basis that he was precluded by s. 85A of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  from  considering  further  evidence,
    relating to the date  of  the  decision,  but  not  produced  with  the
    application. The identity of the sponsor, which had been in issue,  was
    no longer so before the judge.

 2. Unfortunately, as is now agreed, s. 85A applies  only  to  points-based
    cases, which this family reunion appeal was not; and it  follows  under
    s. 85 (5) (b) that the judge needed to consider only, in the  curiously
    old-fashioned   language   of   the   draftsman,   "...   circumstances
    appertaining at the time of the decision to refuse". Since he  decided,
    perhaps rather prematurely, not to  give  his  views  on  the  evidence
    before him at all, we do not have the benefit of whatever he might have
    said.

 3. Mr Smart had not had  the  opportunity  to  consider  the  evidence  in
    advance for himself; and, though the appellant relies on his cash wages
    only so far as they were vouched for, in accordance  with  Home  Office
    approved practice, by HM Revenue and  Customs,  its  effect  could  not
    conveniently be discussed or decided before me. The parties agreed that
    the best way of achieving this would be to allow the appeal,  directing
    a resumed hearing before the same judge, who will be able to deal  with
    the question.

    Appeal

    Resumed hearing directed before Judge Broe, to decide  whether  sponsor
    satisfied maintenance requirements of the Rules  on  all  the  evidence
    relating to the date of the decision
