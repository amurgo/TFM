                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Representation:
    For the  Appellant:          Mr  N  Ahmed  of  counsel,  instructed  by
Lincoln's Chambers, Solicitors.
    For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer.

   1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh.  The  principal  appellant,
      Mrs Rupiah Begum is the mother of the two other  appellants.  She  was
      born on 20 October 1968 and the dates of birth of the children  are  2
      October 1995 and 6 April  1997.They  sought  and  were  refused  entry
      clearances to join their father/husband,  Mr  Abdul  Wahid,  a  person
      present and settled in the UK on the grounds that paragraphs EC-P  1.1
      and E-ECP 3.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  Their  appeals
      brought under Section 82  (1)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002 were heard by  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cohen  at
      Taylor House on 2 December 2014 for reasons given in his determination
      promulgated on 29 December 2014.

   2. The appellants were granted permission to appeal to Upper tribunal  by
      Upper Tribunal Judge F Lindsay for reasons set out in her decision  of
      1 December 2015.

   3. I had the benefit of receiving  written  skeleton  arguments  from  Mr
      Ahmed as well as Mr Jarvis. I  also  received  oral  submissions  from
      them. Mr Ahmed for the appellant had  served  a  paginated  bundle  of
      documents consisting of 109 pages in all and this bundle of  documents
      properly indexed and paginated had also been  before  the  First  Tier
      Tribunal. I understood from both parties that the appeals raised  only
      two issues - one of financial ability of the sponsor  and  the  second
      about whether the principal appellant was or can be  exempt  from  the
      language requirement under the Rules. Both these issues had been found
      not to have been met by the principal appellant in the  findings  made
      by the First tier Judge. The appellants  advanced  the  contention  in
      their grounds of appeal that the two  requirements  were  met  and  in
      concluding that they  had  not,  the  First  tier  Tribunal  had  made
      material errors in law. Mr Jarvis, representing the respondent  argued
      that the determination was sound and that there was no material  error
      of law. References to Pakistan in the  determination  were  manifestly
      erroneous but had no effect on the final outcome of  the  appeals.  He
      asked that the appeals be dismissed.

   4. The First Tier Tribunal Judge engaged  with  the  sponsor's  financial
      ability in Paragraph 11 of his determination. In  this  paragraph  the
      Judge makes no mention of the documentary evidence placed  before  him
      stating that the sponsor's income as a chef  had  been  in  excess  of
      �24,000. This evidence was in the bundle of documents pages 94 to  102
      including copies of self assessment of income filed with the HMRC. The
      First tier Judge said that "the claimed income is not  shown  entering
      the sponsor's account. There are very large unexplained deposits  from
      a third party S Hoque. The sponsor's evidence concerning  his  claimed
      income, method of payment,  hours  etc.  was  vague,  implausible  and
      unconvincing. He did not submit the specified documentation  with  the
      application. The accounts are unaudited and merely based  on  evidence
      provided by the sponsor and I attach limited weight  thereto  (Tanveer
      Ahmed). The sponsor has ongoing health issues and I do  not  find  his
      claim of working up to 100 hours a week �8.33 p.h. �800 weekly pay) to
      be credible."

   5. In a detailed and comprehensive decision,  the  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
      Lyndsey had the following to  say  in  paragraph  5  of  her  decision
      granting permission: "It is arguable that the First tier Tribunal  has
      erred in law in failing to specify at paragraph  11  of  the  decision
      what specified evidence from Appendix FM-SE  was  missing  given  that
      this was the basis on which the entry clearance officer refused  under
      the financial requirements. Judge Cohen seems  to  have  misunderstood
      his task which was simply to assess whether the required evidence  had
      been provided, and not to decide what was needed. It is not  contended
      by the sponsor that he was unwell,  and  this  would  seem  to  be  an
      irrelevant matter which may have been brought into play.  It  is  also
      clear from the entry clearance refusal that unaudited accounts can  be
      sufficient to meet the evidential requirement at Appendix FM-SE. It is
      arguably irrelevant whether there are unexplained  deposits  into  the
      sponsor's bank again: again all  that  is  in  issue  is  whether  the
      relevant specified evidence was present before the Tribunal."  In  her
      paragraph 6 Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsay says,  "The  arguable  errors
      relating to the refusal are arguably material to the outcome under the
      Immigration Rules as the second and third appellants' appeals only had
      to satisfy this matter to succeed." In paragraph  8  of  her  decision
      Judge Lindsay states, "The findings relating to Article 8  ECHR  would
      appear to be strongly  arguably  unlawful.  Not  only  do  they  refer
      erroneously to Pakistan they also state that there is no  family  life
      relationship between the sponsor and the appellant when  it  has  been
      accepted at paragraph 2 of the decision letter that they are a genuine
      family with  the  first  appellant  being  the  sponsors'  wife  in  a
      subsisting  and  genuine  relationship,  and  the  second  and   third
      appellants being their children. In the light of the first appellant's
      ill health it cannot be concluded that this ground is totally  without
      prospect of success, if the appeal were remade."

   6. I have given careful consideration to all the relevant  documents  and
      oral submissions made by Mr Jarvis  and  Mr  Ahmed.  I  have  reminded
      myself only if I find that the determination had one or more  material
      errors of law, I can interfere with the decision  made  by  the  First
      tier Tribunal. The onus on establishing material error of law is  upon
      the appellants. Having studied the determination with care I  have  no
      hesitation in concluding that Judge Cohen made material errors of  law
      in dealing with the  financial  evidential  requirements  placed  upon
      sponsors. It is abundantly clear that in support  of  the  application
      from the appellants for entry clearances they had submitted  documents
      to establish that the sponsor's income for  the  relevant  period  was
      over � 24,000. These documents included the sponsor's tax  return.  It
      was therefore completely irrelevant that the sponsor's  oral  evidence
      was "vague, implausible  and  unconvincing".  Further  the  Judge  was
      manifestly wrong in stating that the requisite documentary evidence on
      income had not been  submitted  with  the  application  and  that  the
      accounts filed by the sponsor should have been audited accounts. There
      is no requirement under the relevant provisions  applicable  to  these
      appeals that the accounts filed should be audited. At one stage of the
      proceedings before me it was suggested by Mr Jarvis that the  accounts
      filed were unsigned and therefore  could  not  have  been  taken  into
      account. However, he withdrew that submission after being  shown  that
      he was factually wrong in making that submission. I  find  that  Judge
      Cohen made a material error of  law  in  finding  that  the  sponsor's
      documentary evidence on financial income did not show that he had  met
      the financial requirement under the  Rules.  That  finding  in  itself
      enables me to set aside the decision of Judge Cohen.  Nevertheless,  I
      will address the second ground upon which permission was granted - the
      principal appellant's failure to  meet  the  requirement  relating  to
      English language. In that regard I find that the engagement  of  Judge
      Cohen with evidence relevant  to  this  matter  in  terms  of  pleaded
      disability or mental health of the principal appellant was  inaccurate
      in that he gave little or no weight to the medical  evidence  evidence
      relating  to  this  matter.  Judge  Cohen  in  paragraph  13  of   his
      determination states that the appellant's submitted document from ESOL
      from  City  and  Guilds  had  been  investigated  and  found   to   be
      "unreliable".  There is no document on my file to show that to be  the
      case. The rest of  the  content  of  paragraph  13  of  Judge  Cohen's
      determination is somewhat incoherent and confusing. It is however  the
      case that the principal appellant has not passed the listening element
      of the test. But as  the  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  has  stated  in  her
      decision granting permission, Judge Cohen failed to link  the  medical
      evidence with her ability to learn and  pass  an  English  test.  With
      respect I agree with that view.

   7. For the reasons given hereinbefore, having found  material  errors  of
      law in the decision made by Judge Cohen I set aside his  determination
      dismissing the appeals of the three appellants.

   8. I remake the decision based on all the evidence that was before  Judge
      Cohen and was placed before me by Mr Ahmed  in  a  helpful  manner  in
      accordance with the directions given by Upper Tribunal Judge  Lindsay.
      In so doing I took account of  the  skeleton  arguments  filed  by  Mr
      Jarvis for the respondent.  I  did  not  find  this  document  of  any
      assistance. The respondent produced no other documentation  to  resist
      the appellant's claims.

   9. I find that at the date of the impugned decision  the  income  of  the
      sponsor to be meeting the  relevant  financial  requirement  had  been
      satisfactorily evidenced  by  the  sponsor.  I  accept  the  sponsor's
      witness statement in  conjunction  with  his  accounts  filed  by  his
      accountant and his self assessment for HMRC in this regard.

  10. I also find based upon the medical evidence which had  been  presented
      to the respondent and was also before the First tier Tribunal that the
      mental and physical ability of the principal appellant was  such  that
      she should have been allowed exemption from passing the remaining  one
      element of the language test. I would therefore allow the  appeals  of
      all three appellants under the Immigration Rules.

  11. If, however I am found to be wrong  in  my  conclusion  regarding  the
      English language requirement in respect of the principal appellant,  I
      have also considered her claim under Article 8 of the  ECHR  which  as
      Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsay said was  "strongly  arguably  unlawful".
      With respect I agree with Judge Lindsay's assessment.

  12. I find for the same reason as she has set out in paragraph  8  of  her
      decision that the interference caused by denial of entry clearance  to
      the  principal  appellant  is  an  unreasonable  and  disproportionate
      interference with her right to family life.

  13. The principal appellant's relationship with the sponsor has been found
      to be genuine and subsisting and she suffers from ill health,  needing
      the care, support and company of her husband and two very  young  kids
      in the United Kingdom. I have of course taken due account of the  best
      interests of the children as a primary but not the only  consideration
      in coming to that conclusion just as I have given due  weight  to  the
      sponsor's length of residence in the UK as  well  as  his  unblemished
      record as a resident and citizen of this country. Further I have taken
      into consideration the speeches of Lady Hale and  Lord  Hodge  in  the
      case of R(on the applications of Ali and Bibi v Secretary of State for
      the Home Department [2015] UKSC 59 as reproduced  in  the  appellants'
      skeleton argument. I have borne in mind that the right to  family  and
      private life is not absolute and that in the proportionality  exercise
      I have taken account of whether the sponsor can reasonably be expected
      to live in Bangladesh to enjoy his life with his family. My answer  to
      that question is in the negative. Promoting and protecting the  rights
      of families to live together is a  duty.  It  is  not  in  the  public
      interest to divide and separate families. For the avoidance of doubt I
      should make it clear that in addressing the Article 8 issue  in  these
      appeals I have followed the step by step  approach  enjoined  by  Lord
      Bingham in Razgar decision. Outcome in each case depends  on  its  own
      particular facts and that it is extremely rare  that  two  cases  will
      have identical facts. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the principal that
      the outcome in each case will depend on its own facts,  I  have  taken
      account of the relevant case law from the higher courts.

  14. The appeals of all three appellants are therefore allowed  and  it  is
      directed that in granting them entry clearances, due regard should  be
      had for the three years that the appellants have had to wait get their
      claims resolved.
