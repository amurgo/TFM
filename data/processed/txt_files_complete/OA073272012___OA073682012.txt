Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Stevens of Duncan Lewis and Co
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are citizens of Eritrea. They are  sister  and  brother.
    The first Appellant Eman was born on 30th December 1993 and the  second
    Appellant Remzi was born on 11th November 1995. They are  now  aged  19
    years and 17 years respectively.

 2. This is their appeal against the decision of Judge Glenn made following
    a hearing at Hatton Cross on 18th October 2012.

Background

 3. The Appellants applied for  entry  clearance  to  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom in December 2011, to join  their  sister  Leila  who  had  been
    granted refugee status here. Leila  has  been  present  in  the  United
    Kingdom since September 2006 and gained recognition as a refugee  (five
    years leave granted until 3rd January 2012).

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer  considered  the  Appellants'  applications
    under paragraph 319X Dependant Relatives (Family Reunion)  and  refused
    both applications. There was no Article 8 consideration.

 5. When grounds of appeal were submitted it was  claimed  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer should have also considered  paragraph  352D  of  the
    current Immigration Rules as what was being said in essence,  was  that
    Leila had assumed sole parental responsibility for the Appellants.

 6. By the time of the hearing before Judge Glenn however, it was  conceded
    by the Appellants (through their  representative)  that  neither  could
    succeed under the Immigration Rules and what remained  for  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge to decide, was a consideration of Article  8  ECHR.
    The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  dismissed  both  Appellant's  appeals
    finding that there would be no Article 8 breach  in  either  case.  The
    Appellants  sought  and  were  granted  permission  to   appeal   those
    decisions. Permission was granted as DJ  Barton  found  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had erroneously stated that both  Appellants  were  aged
    over 18 years at the date of the  hearing,  when  in  fact  the  second
    Appellant was just shy of 17 years of age (both Appellants  were  under
    18 years of age when their applications were made - a point  which  the
    Judge recognised).

 7. DJ Barton concluded that the Judge's determination contained  an  error
    of law. in coming to that conclusion he stated,

         "I find that the determinations were both tainted  by  the  Judge's
         error in finding Remzi to be an adult at  the  date  of  the  ECO's
         decisions. It will be necessary for the Appellants' Article 8  ECHR
         position to be reassessed at a  remake  hearing  before  the  Upper
         Tribunal. Mr Stevens sought leave for further oral evidence  to  be
         given at the second stage hearing and this was given".

     Thus the matter comes before me as a resumed hearing.

The Hearing

 8. Mr Stevens appeared on behalf of both Appellants and Mr Avery on behalf
    of the Respondent. At the commencement of the hearing I reaffirmed with
    both parties that what was before me was an Article 8  hearing  as  per
    the terms of DJ Barton's conclusions of 8th February 2012. Both parties
    agreed.

 9. The evidence before me consisted of the same bundle as that before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge served under cover of Duncan  Lewis's  letter
    of 12th October 2012, save that an additional transcript email from the
    second Appellant was submitted together with an  Amnesty  International
    public statement entitled 'Sudan must  end  forced  returns  of  asylum
    seekers to Eritrea' and dated 14th August 2012. I confirm that  I  have
    taken into account all the  documentary  evidence.  The  Sponsor  Leila
    Mohammed  Adgoy  gave  evidence  before   me   through   the   Tigrinya
    interpreter.

10. The Sponsor told me that she lives at 44 Forsyth Gardens London  SE  17
    3NE. Her date of birth is 11th  November  1988.  She  relied  upon  her
    witness statement signed and dated 10th  October  2012.  In  that,  she
    states she left Eritrea in August 2006 fleeing first of all  to  Sudan.
    She left because of the threat of National Service. She arrived in  the
    United Kingdom in September 2006 and  was  granted  refugee  status  in
    2007. She now has refugee settlement granted May 2012.

11. She told me that in 2006, when she left Eritrea both Appellants  formed
    part of her family unit and she was their sole carer - her  father  had
    died and her mother was paralysed by a stroke in September 2003.

12. When the Sponsor fled to Sudan she said that the following people  were
    left at home- her mother, her sister Aziza and the two Appellants  Eman
    and Remzi. She said that the two younger siblings Remzi and  Eman  left
    Eritrea in July 2011 and travelled to Sudan. By this  time  her  mother
    had died and when the two Appellants arrived in  Sudan  they  contacted
    her.

13. She arranged for a friend to look after them and for the Appellants  to
    live with a lady called Sara Haile. The Sponsor  said  that  she  sends
    money to Sudan and this is used to pay  for  the  Appellants  rent  and
    upkeep.

14. When asked about the email transcript which had been produced, she said
    that her brother Remzi had written it. She and the Appellants  keep  in
    contact through Skype and email.  When  asked  to  clarify  when  extra
    difficulties the Appellants faced in Sudan, she said that her sister is
    asthmatic and that she had to send money for a hospital  treatment  and
    medicine.

15. In cross-examination the Sponsor revealed that when she  left  Eritrea,
    her sister Aziza was looking after the  family.  She  stated  that  the
    family were supported from money which she the  Sponsor  had  forwarded
    from her benefits that she received in the UK. She was asked to explain
    how she forwarded the money. She responded by saying that people  going
    back to Eritrea took the money for her. She was very vague as  to  when
    and how much she had sent. At this point the Sponsor  was  referred  to
    her asylum interview. It was put to her that her claim that she was the
    one who was  responsible  for  her  family  back  in  Eritrea  was  not
    credible. She was referred to question 55 which states,

    Q:   Earlier you said that you cared for your mother now you  say  your
             uncle looked after the family. Can you explain?

    Reply:   At home I was doing  all  the  work  like  kitchen  work  like
             cooking and washing clothes and externally my  uncle  was  the
             one who was providing us with food and money.

    It was put to the Sponsor that in fact her uncle was the  one  who  was
    looking after the family not her. The question then had to be  repeated
    and the Sponsor then gave the information that her father had  owned  a
    shop and that the shop had been sold and that money from  the  proceeds
    was used. She also said that her uncle became "our guardian the absence
    of our father".

16. She then qualified this by saying that when she came to the UK, it  was
    her responsibility to support her siblings. She agreed however that she
    had not been informed and nor did she know that the two Appellants were
    going to leave Eritrea. She said that neither of them work in Sudan nor
    do they go to school. She said no one will  employ  them  as  they  are
    minors.

17. Concerning the email transcript which had been sent, she  said  it  had
    been written by her brother Remzi who has access to email and Skype. He
    does not own a computer but goes to a coffee shop and is able  to  keep
    contact with her that way. That concluded her evidence.

Findings and Conclusions

18. What is before me is an Article 8 ECHR claim to family life - it having
    been  conceded  that  neither  Appellant  could   succeed   under   the
    Immigration Rules.

19. In assessing whether family life exists between the Sponsor and her two
    siblings I take into account that at the date of the applications, both
    Appellants were minors. Eman was just shy of 18 years of age and  Remzi
    was almost 17 years of age. Both Appellants are now refugees living  in
    Sudan. In considering whether the Appellants' rights  under  Article  8
    are engaged I need to consider the five questions set out and posed  in
    the case of R v SSHD ex parte Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27.  The  essential
    object of Article 8 is to protect the individual from arbitrary  action
    by public authorities. Therefore the first question posed is  will  the
    decision be an interference by a public authority with the exercise  of
    the applicant's right to respect for his private or family life? I find
    it is not. I say this for  the  following  reasons.  The  Sponsor  left
    Eritrea  in  2006.  She  left  behind  in  the  family  home,  the  two
    Appellants, their older sister Aziza and  their  mother.  It  has  been
    accepted that their mother was the victim  of  a  stroke.  However  the
    Sponsor tried to tell me that before she left she was  the  sole  carer
    for her siblings and that she is now the only  family  member  who  can
    take care of them. This I do not accept.

20. When the Sponsor left Eritrea her mother was alive. In  addition  I  am
    drawn to the Sponsor own evidence in  her  asylum  interview.  In  that
    interview she stated that she helped with  household  chores  but  that
    food and money were provided by her uncle. She also said, to  me,  that
    on the death of her father,  her  uncle  became  their  guardian.  When
    pressed by Mr Avery on this point, she conceded  that  the  family  had
    owned a shop and that the shop had been sold after her  father's  death
    and this provided money. On balance I am satisfied that there was money
    available from the sale of the shop and from her uncle  and  that  this
    was the main financial provision for the family in Eritrea.

21. The finding above is reinforced by  the  Sponsor's  own  evidence  when
    asked to try and quantify however  much  financial  help  she  sent  to
    Eritrea, following her arrival in the UK. Her answers  were  vague  and
    whilst I accept that it is difficult to forward money to  Eritrea,  the
    amount that she suggested came to no more  than  saying  sometimes  �50
    sometimes �60.

22. Further I note and make a finding, that the Sponsor was not told  about
    nor consulted when  the  two  Appellants  left  Eritrea  for  Sudan.  I
    conclude therefore that their welfare did not depend upon the  Sponsor,
    but upon others. The Sponsor has not  lived  with  the  Appellants  for
    several years, although I accept  that  they  have  kept  in  touch  as
    siblings would.

23. If I am wrong about the existence of family life, I go on  to  consider
    the other questions posed in Razgar. In essence what was put forward on
    behalf of the Appellants was one of  proportionality.  What  was  urged
    upon me was that the Appellants  were  minors  at  the  time  of  their
    applications, they were in Sudan and it was claimed in  fear  of  being
    returned to Eritrea. I keep in mind  ZH  (Tanzania)  -  that  the  best
    interest of a child is a primary consideration and Beoku - Betts that I
    should look at the family unit holistically.

24. I understand that both Appellants are recognised as refugees  in  Sudan
    and there is some form of documentation afforded them. It  was  put  on
    their behalf, that they may be in danger of being returned to  Eritrea,
    as there is some evidence of refugees  being  returned  from  Sudan  to
    Eritrea in the past. There was no further evidence  put  before  me  on
    this point and no cogent evidence that the two Appellants  had  in  any
    way been approached by the authorities in Sudan as potential returnees.

25. There is  evidence  that  the  first  Appellant  has  suffered  medical
    problems with her breathing. However that  amounts  to  one  documented
    incident of a five day stay in  hospital  and  fortunately  no  further
    incidents are reported. I am told that neither Appellant goes to school
    but I keep in mind that at the date of application both Appellants  had
    reached 16 years of age. Nothing was said to me  about  what  education
    they had received  in  Eritrea  and  whether  or  not  they  reasonably
    expected to continue their education.

26. The Appellants live in rented accommodation which is paid  for  by  the
    Sponsor, who sends �50 a month to support them. They are  looked  after
    by a lady called Sara Haile.

27. There was nothing put forward before  me  to  show  why  this  position
    should not remain in the future.

28. Were the Appellants  to  be  granted  entry  clearance  they  would  of
    necessity be reliant upon UK public  funds  and  certainly  at  present
    there is no accommodation available for them. Taking all these  factors
    into account I conclude it is not disproportionate under Article 8,  to
    refuse them entry clearance.



DECISION

29. The decisions made by the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of
    law. I therefore remake the decisions.

30. These appeals are dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made
