Representation:
Appellant   Ms Norman, Counsel, instructed by Sterling and Law Associates
                    LLP
Respondent  Mr Tarlow (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Ukraine.  The  appellant  had  previously
    been issued with a residence card issued on April 6, 2009  valid  until
    April 6, 2014. On May 12, 2014 he  applied  for  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of his right to reside here. The  respondent  refused  the
    application on June 12, 2014.

 2.  The  appellant  appealed  this  decision  on  August  7,  2014,  under
    Regulation 26 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006.

 3. The appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Robinson  as  a
    paper case on June 19, 2015 and in a decision promulgated  on  July  9,
    2015 he refused the application having regard to  the  EEA  Regulations
    and article 8 ECHR.

 4. The appellant sought a reconsideration and in  the  alternative  lodged
    grounds of appeal on July 16, 2015 submitting the Judge  had  erred  by
    failing to have regard to a bundle of documents submitted  on  June  1,
    2015 by first class post.

 5. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Hollingsworth on October 12, 2015 but  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Mailer granted permission on the basis of an arguable  procedural
    irregularity.

 6. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I extend that Order.

 7. The matter came before me on the above date. Ms  Norman  confirmed  the
    letter dated June 1, 2015 and documents attached had been sent by first
    class post and had not been faxed. Mr Tarlow stated  he  had  seen  the
    letter and was prepared to accept it had been sent to the  Tribunal  in
    good time and that it appeared the letter had never been tied up to the
    file.  In the circumstances he was prepared to concede an error in law.



 8. He viewed the copy documents that were available and indicated that  if
    these documents had been before the First-tier Judge then they may have
    led to a different outcome. Mr Tarlow was not prepared to concede  this
    issue as the originals had not been seen and  invited  me  to  find  an
    error in law and remit the matter back to the First-tier  Tribunal.  Ms
    Norman agreed with this approach.

 9. The Judge could not be faulted for  his  approach  but  the  respondent
    accepted there was an issue of fairness that had to  be  considered  in
    this case and based on that principle I agreed there was  an  error  in
    law.

10. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

         "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
         Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal to the Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
         Tribunal finds that the making of the decision  concerned  involved
         the making of an error on a point of law, the  Upper  Tribunal  may
         set aside the decision and, if it does so, must  either  remit  the
         case to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  or
         proceed (in accordance with relevant Practice  Directions)  to  re-
         make the decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii).

         The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed to re-
         make the decision, instead of remitting the case to the  First-tier
         Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½

          a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

          b) the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."

11. Mr Tarlow invited me  to  remit  the  matter  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and in light of the Practice Direction  I  agreed  the  matter
    should be remitted.

12. There is already a bundle on the Court file in addition to  the  bundle
    that was sent on June 1, 2015. The appellant should  also  ensure  that
    there is a witness statement from his employer addressing any  concerns
    raised by the respondent and that witness should assist  the  Court  by
    attending the hearing to give oral evidence unless the respondent  does
    not require that person's attendance. The appellant should also  attend
    and be available for any questions bearing in mind the content  of  the
    refusal letter.

    DECISION

13. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I have set aside the decision.

14. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    appeal  hearing  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007.
