                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Tanzania whose appeal  was  dismissed  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Clark in a decision promulgated on  4th  June
    2019.

 2. Grounds of application were  lodged.  It  was  said  that  the  judge's
    findings were devoid of adequate reasoning and she  had  made  findings
    which contained a cursory consideration of the  facts.   There  was  no
    dispute that the Appellant and his partner Miss J [D] were in a genuine
    and subsisting relationship.  In particular  the  judge  had  erred  in
    finding that there was no suggestion from the school that the Appellant
    had not been to the school on his own  to  drop  or  collect  [C]  from
    school.  The judge had found Miss [D] to be a credible  witness.   Miss
    [D] would normally leave [C] in the Appellant's care  in  circumstances
    where she had needed to care for her mother or  take  her  for  medical
    appointments.

 3. The judge had attached weight to the  Appellant's  misunderstanding  of
    [C]'s school as a "special needs" school instead of  a  school  with  a
    special needs provision.  The judge had ignored other positive findings
    that  demonstrated  the  Appellant  had  a   genuine   joint   parental
    relationship with [C].  The judge had minimised [C]'s relationship with
    the Appellant to a mere attachment by reason of living  together.   The
    photographs of the Appellant and [C]'s trip to Legoland should  not  be
    easily discounted as having no effect as a testimony of the Appellant's
    bond with [C].  The misdirection prevented the judge  from  considering
    the Appellant's circumstances in the context of Section 117B(6) of  the
    2002 Act.

 4. It was further submitted (Ground 2)  that  the  judge's  assessment  of
    [C]'s best interests was confusing and erroneous in the sense that  the
    judge accepted it would be in [C]'s best interests to remain  here  but
    went on by saying his best interests might be to relocate  to  Tanzania
    with his mother despite the fact that [C]'s father was British and  had
    weekly contact with him.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes in
    a decision dated 11th June 2019.

 6. Before me Ms Litchfield,  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  said  that  the
    judge's findings were irrational.  Reliance was placed on the  grounds.
    The appropriate decision for me to make would be to  set  the  decision
    aside and remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal.  There would  be
    a further medical report on [C] who was being currently assessed.

 7. For the Home Office Mr Tarlow said  the  judge's  reasoning  was  sound
    enough.  In paragraph 50 the judge had fully considered the possibility
    of Miss [D] and [C] moving to Tanzania.  I  was  asked  to  uphold  the
    decision.

 8. I reserved my decision.

Conclusions

 9. Section 117B(6) is important  in  this  case  as  it  says  the  public
    interest does not require removal of  the  Appellant  where  he  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying child.  The judge
    found that he did not come under  117B(6)  for  the  reasons  given  in
    paragraph 41 of her decision.  In that paragraph the judge  appears  to
    give two reasons why the Appellant has failed to establish  a  parental
    relationship.  The first was a letter from the school which  said  that
    the Appellant had accompanied Miss [D] to collect [C]  from  school  on
    "several occasions" and he had attended two school events  but  he  had
    not been at the school "lately" and there  was  no  suggestion  he  had
    taken [C] to school and picked him up without Miss [D].  What the judge
    was really saying was that the letter from the school  was  not  wholly
    satisfactory because of what the school did not say about the Appellant
    attending the school.  The judge added that the Appellant had suggested
    that [C] went to a "special" school due to  his  learning  difficulties
    but was not  the  case.   The  judge  concluded  that  the  Appellant's
    misunderstanding of this did not demonstrate  a  close  involvement  or
    interest in [C]'s education.

10.  In  my  view  this  reasoning  is,  as  described  by  Ms  Litchfield,
    irrational.  It is certainly not adequate.  It is not disputed that the
    Appellant did go to the school and had collected  [C]  from  school  on
    several occasions.  The fact that the Appellant  said  [C]  went  to  a
    "special school" was not technically  correct  because  he  went  to  a
    mainstream primary school which had a good reputation for  its  special
    needs  provision.   The  fact  that  the   Appellant   had   a   slight
    misunderstanding on the nature of the school does not go anywhere  near
    to justifying a  conclusion  that  he  had  not  demonstrated  a  close
    involvement or interest in [C]'s education and  therefore  he  did  not
    qualify under Section 117B(6). The finding also ignores the  fact  that
    the judge found Miss [D] to be a credible witness (paragraph 36 of  the
    decision) and her evidence would  support  the  Appellant's  contention
    that he was in a parental relationship with [C] - see paragraph  17  of
    her witness statement.

11. In failing to give rational reasons for finding that the Appellant  was
    not in a parental relationship with Miss [D]'s son [C] means  that  the
    judge's decision contains errors in law which were fundamental  to  the
    issue of whether the appeal should be dismissed or allowed.   It  seems
    to me that the decision must be set aside as it is not safe. Given that
    finding it is not necessary to comment on Ground 2 of  the  application
    except to say that it may well have force.

12. Unfortunately, it seems to me that further  fact-finding  is  necessary
    and the matter should be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be
    heard by a judge other than Judge Clark.

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is therefore set aside  in  its
    entirety.  No findings of the First-tier Tribunal are to stand.   Under
    Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice Statement  7.2  the
    nature and extent  of  the  judicial  fact-finding  necessary  for  the
    decision to be remade is such that it is appropriate to remit the  case
    to the First-tier Tribunal.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

No anonymity order is required.
