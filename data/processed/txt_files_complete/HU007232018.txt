                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and background

1.   This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal to dismiss his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    to refuse him further leave to remain based on  his  relationship  with
    his wife, [SH].  The application was made  on  14  September  2017  but
    refused in November 2017.

2.   The appellant appealed the Secretary of State's decision to the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 15 December 2017, but he failed  to  pay  the  correct
    fee.   Payment  of  that  fee  was  requested  and,   eventually,   was
    forthcoming. A notice of hearing was sent out on 16  March  2018.   The
    directions required the appellant to send any documents he relied on to
    the First-tier Tribunal and serve those documents on any  other  party,
    identifying  essential  passages.   Copies  of  documents  had  to   be
    translated, where necessary. He was informed that it was important that
    they were available, as the respondent would review the  evidence  "you
    submit before the hearing and this could result in the  decision  being
    reversed in your favour". All documents relied on had to be sent to the
    Tribunal itself.

3.   Judge of First-tier Tribunal Isaacs (the judge) decided to dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal having  refused  an  adjournment  application.  That
    refusal is the principal basis for the present appeal.

4.   The appellant was granted permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    by Upper Tribunal Judge  Keki?  on  31  December  2018.   Although  all
    grounds were described as "arguable",  Judge  Keki?  particularly  drew
    attention to the fact that there was an application for an  adjournment
    before the First-tier Tribunal because the appellant's  representatives
    had ceased to act for him ten days prior to the  hearing.  Judge  Keki?
    suggested that the appellant may not have had an opportunity to present
    all his evidence before the First-tier Tribunal and thus  the  decision
    of that tribunal might have been unfair. Indeed, he still  had  certain
    documents, it had been claimed, which had not been considered.

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal

5.   Mr Hossain expanded on the appellant's grounds of appeal. He  suggested
    that there were documents in the appellant's former  solicitor's  file,
    including a draft witness statement, which had not been provided to the
    First-tier Tribunal. He said  that  there  were  also  documents  which
    confirmed  his  client's  cohabitation  with  his  wife.   However,  Mr
    Hossain, was unable to provide any further details of those  documents.
    The grounds of appeal  in  support  of  the  appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal point out that the appellant was  represented  in  the  appeal
    proceedings before the First -tier Tribunal (Chancery  Solicitors)  but
    wished to instruct another firm. However, unfortunately, the  new  firm
    demanded ï¿½3,000 before they would act. On  that  basis,  the  appellant
    chose to make various applications to adjourn  the  appeal,  but  those
    applications were unsuccessful.

6.   It seems that the appellant disputed a bill from  Chancery  Solicitors,
    his former solicitors. That firm sent a  fax  to  the  Tribunal  on  13
    September 2018 notifying  it  that  the  appellant  had  withdrawn  his
    instructions.  The appellant sent a further email to  the  First  -tier
    Tribunal in the early hours of  18  September  2018  stating  that  the
    appellant  was  unable  to  pay  a  substantial  fee  to  instruct  new
    solicitors at short notice.  He also claimed  to  suffer  from  chronic
    migraine due to an error by  the  court.   When  that  application  was
    refused on 19 September 2018, the  notice  of  refusal  was  mistakenly
    stated to be issued on "19 July" rather than 19  September-the  correct
    date.  However, it is unlikely  anyone  was  misled  by  that  mistake,
    because it referred to the hearing on 20  September  2018.  Mr  Hossain
    explained that the appellant renewed the adjournment application before
    the First-tier  Tribunal  at  the  hearing,  but  the  application  was
    refused, and the appeal proceeded without representation.   Mr  Hossain
    submitted that had the adjournment request not been  refused,  material
    evidence  might  have  been  brought  forward  which  could  have  been
    considered by the judge. Mr  Hossain  also  sought  to  go  behind  the
    findings of the judge and say that they were not findings that  he  was
    able to properly come to because he had only  a  partial  view  of  the
    evidence.  The appellant's wife had not attended to give  evidence  and
    the judge did not have a witness statement from the appellant. Nor  did
    he did not have a full copy of the interview.

Discussion of the merits of the appeal

7.   I am not satisfied that those grounds carry any weight. First,  dealing
    with the adjournment, it does seem to me that the reference to "19 July
    2018" in paragraph 7 was immaterial. What the judge was  really  saying
    was that the appellant had from  13  September  2018  to  instruct  new
    solicitors. It seems from the grounds before the Upper Tribunal that  a
    different firm of solicitors than the previous firm agreed to  act  but
    required funding to be in place before doing so.  I  am  not  satisfied
    that any material document would be subject to a solicitor's lien and I
    have seen no confirmation from the firm concerned. Nor was it suggested
    that any lien operated before the judge. If Mr Hossain's assertions are
    correct, it would mean  that  the  former  solicitors  had  refused  to
    disclose those documents to his firm for several  months.  I  have  not
    been referred to a single document which supports  such  an  assertion.
    Clearly, if, as now appears, Mr Hossain can act he would have been able
    to give the appropriate solicitor's undertaking for the release of  the
    file/papers in  return  for  payment  of  any  costs  outstanding.  The
    appellant  was  advised  of  the  opportunity  to  report  his   former
    solicitors to the Solicitors Regulation Authority seen no evidence that
    he has done all the results of any such investigation. This leads me to
    be sceptical over the criticisms of his former solicitors.  Even if the
    appellant were granted an adjournment it is not clear how long a  delay
    would have been occasioned, given that Mr Hossain claims still  not  to
    be in possession of the documents he claims would  be  helpful  to  his
    client's case, despite the elapse of several further months  since  the
    hearing in the First-tier Tribunal. It would not be reasonable  and  in
    accordance  with  the  overriding  objective  to  adjourn  the   appeal
    indefinitely, on the off-chance that the  missing  documents,  which  I
    repeat have not been identified with any degree of accuracy,  might  be
    forthcoming.

Conclusions

8.   I have been reminded of the case of Nwaigwe [2014] UKUT 00418 in  which
    the President, Mr Justice McClosky, emphasised the need for fairness in
    determining any application to adjourn.  I am satisfied that the  judge
    did act fairly indeed  dealt  with  the  adjournment  application  with
    unusual thoroughness in a number of paragraphs explaining  why  in  his
    view it was incumbent upon the appellant to prepare for the hearing and
    provide all necessary evidence in support of his appeal. I am satisfied
    that the decision to reject not to adjourn exercised in accordance with
    the tribunal's overriding objective  to  manage  cases  fairly  and  in
    accordance with  the  2014  Procedure  Rules  Rule  4(3)(h)  and  I  am
    satisfied that the decision was both fair  and  just.  As  it  was  his
    appeal, the appellant had the burden of proof. The obligation rested on
    him to produce the relevant evidence in support  of  his  appeal.   The
    judge also concluded that the appellant had  an  ample  opportunity  to
    appoint  new  representatives  in  the  ten  days  or  so  between  the
    solicitors coming off the record and the hearing taking  place.   I  am
    satisfied the judge was exercising a case  management  discretion  well
    within his discretion and reached an appropriate conclusion that he was
    entailed to come to.

9.   As far as the lack of a whole interview record  is  concerned,  I  find
    that a surprising submission given the number of paragraphs  where  the
    appellant dealt with these issues. In any event, the Immigration  Judge
    appears to have comprehensively rejected  the  appellant's  credibility
    having heard  his  evidence  and  having  noted  several  discrepancies
    between the appellant's account in oral evidence and other evidence.

10.  No clear explanation was given for the appellant's  wife's  failure  to
    attend the hearing. It was suggested that she may have been in fear but
    there is no proper basis for that submission in my view. This  was,  in
    any event a secondary ground of attack on the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. In my view the  judge  appears  to  have  conducted  the
    hearing properly and fully considered the appellant's case in  reaching
    his decision. Although he had no witness statement, the  appellant  was
    given a full opportunity to present his evidence and I  note  that  the
    respondent did not attend the hearing, so the appellant was  not  cross
    examined.

11.  Overall the decision both to refuse  the  adjournment  application  and
    the way the judge conducted the hearing do not  disclose  any  material
    error of law. The decision to dismiss the appeal  was  a  decision  the
    judge was entitled to come to on the evidence before him.

Decision

12.  Accordingly, the appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  by  the  appellant  is
    dismissed.

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss the  appeal  against
    the respondent's refusal to grant him further leave to remain on  human
    rights grounds stands.

    No anonymity direction was made by the FTT  and  I  make  no  anonymity
    direction.
