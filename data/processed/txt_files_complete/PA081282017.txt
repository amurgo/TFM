                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Twydell, promulgated on 28 February  2019.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy on 29 April 2019.





Anonymity

   2. A direction has been made previously and is repeated below  because  a
      number of minors are affected by this appeal.

Background

 3. On 11 February 2001, the appellant was granted  leave  to  enter  as  a
    visitor. He was granted further leave to remain as a student  until  31
    October 2002. Following his marriage to VJ with whom he had a child  K,
    the applicant was granted leave to remain as a spouse  until  19  March
    2004. The appellant  was  granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  6
    February 2004.

 4. On 28 July 2014, the appellant was convicted, following a guilty  plea,
    of six counts of supplying Class A drugs for which he was sentenced  to
    two years' imprisonment. Thereafter he was informed of his liability to
    deportation and on 8 May 2015, the deportation order was signed.  Delay
    to the progress of this case was caused  by  the  respondent  initially
    certifying the appellant's human rights claim as well as the  appellant
    raising asylum matters.

 5. On 11 August 2017 the appellant was served with a decision refusing his
    protection and human rights claims and it is this decision which is the
    subject  of  this  appeal.  In  refusing  the  appellant's  claim,  the
    respondent relied on Section 72 of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum  Act  2002,  concluding  that  he  had  been  convicted   of   a
    particularly serious crime and that he  constituted  a  danger  to  the
    community of the United Kingdom, presumptions that  the  appellant  had
    failed to rebut. His asylum claim and  Humanitarian  Protection  claims
    were therefore refused under paragraphs 336 and 339F of the Immigration
    Rules. The appellant's  claim  that  he  would  face  ill-treatment  in
    Jamaica from the family of his friend who was killed in place  of  him,
    was considered without a personal interview with the appellant  because
    of the delay in the claim being brought. The  respondent  decided  that
    the appellant's claim was not objectively well-founded because he could
    avoid ill-treatment by relocating within Jamaica or seeking  protection
    from the Jamaican authorities.

 6. In refusing the appellant's Article 8 claim,  the  respondent  accepted
    that the appellant had  a  genuine  subsisting  relationship  with  his
    partner and two of his six children but did not accept that it would be
    unduly harsh for them to either remain in the  United  Kingdom  without
    the appellant  or  accompany  him  to  Jamaica  after  the  appellant's
    deportation. It was not accepted that the  appellant  met  the  private
    life exception to deportation because he had spent less  than  half  of
    his life lawfully present in the United Kingdom. It  was  not  accepted
    that there were very  compelling  circumstances  which  outweighed  the
    public interest in his deportation.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The appellant did not pursue his  asylum  and  humanitarian  protection
    claim. The First-tier Tribunal judge accepted that  the  appellant  had
    genuine and subsisting parental  relationships  with  all  six  of  his
    children and that his relationship with his  partner  was  genuine  and
    subsisting. Nonetheless, the judge found that it would  not  be  unduly
    harsh for the children and his partner to remain in the United  Kingdom
    without the appellant. Regarding the youngest children  M  and  I,  the
    judge found that it was not unduly harsh  for  them  to  accompany  the
    appellant and their mother to Jamaica.

The grounds of appeal

 8. The grounds of appeal were fivefold. Firstly, it was  argued  that  the
    judge adopted an overly restrictive approach in her analysis of  unduly
    harshness in relation to M  and  I.  Secondly,  the  judge's  focus  on
    whether or not the appellant was the main carer of his children  skewed
    her findings on the issue of unduly harshness. Thirdly, the judge erred
    in her consideration of unduly harshness in relation to the appellant's
    partner. Fourthly, the  judge  failed  to  make  any  findings  on  the
    conclusions of the independent social worker. Lastly, the judge  failed
    to take  into  account  the  considerable  delay  in  implementing  the
    deportation order as well as the appellant's rehabilitation.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted on a narrow basis not mentioned in the
    grounds, because "the  judge  in  paragraph  39  of  the  determination
    applied the decision of the Upper Tribunal in KMO (section 117 - unduly
    harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT 00543 (IAC) whereas that decision  has  been
    distinguished by the Supreme Court  in  KO  (Nigeria)[2018]  UKSC  53."
    Permission was not explicitly refused on any ground.

10. The respondent did not file a Rule 24 response.

The hearing

11. Ms Bond argued that the First-tier Tribunal judge  repeatedly  referred
    to the appellant not being the primary carer of some  of  his  children
    and this skewed  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.  The  judge  mistakenly
    believed that the impact on the children of the appellant's removal was
    not unduly harsh because the children have a primary carer in the  form
    of their respective mothers. The judge's consideration was too  narrow,
    she repeated that error and the  decision  was  materially  flawed.  In
    addition, at [41] judge said that the best interests  of  the  children
    were only one factor to be considered, notwithstanding her earlier self-
    direction that it was a primary consideration.   Ms  Bond  argued  that
    there  was  no  proper  consideration  of  the  circumstances  of   the
    appellant's partner and the judge's finding that she is  a  resourceful
    and committed carer did not address whether it was unduly harsh for her
    to go to Jamaica with the appellant  or  stay  in  the  United  Kingdom
    without  him.   There  were  witness  statements  by  family   members,
    including the partner's father which were not considered by the  judge.
    Nor were the conclusions of  the  independent  social  worker  featured
    anywhere in the decision.

12. Ms Bond informed me that the appellant had drawn an  additional  matter
    to her attention on the morning of the hearing. At [24] the  judge  had
    made findings regarding the seriousness of the  appellant's  offending.
    According to the pre-sentence report, the street value of all the drugs
    in the appellant's possession was �80. The report further  states  that
    the total weight of the drugs in his possession was  just  under  1  kg
    which Ms Bond submitted would be worth considerably more than �80.  The
    judge relied on the said report and found that the appellant was caught
    in possession of just under 1 kg of drugs.  Owing to missing documents,
    Ms Bond was unable to  cross-check  the  quantities  in  question  with
    either the indictment or judge's sentencing remarks.

13. A further issue which was raised at the hearing for the first time  was
    that at [34] the judge considered there to be some ambiguity  regarding
    the address the appellant was living at. I was told that both addresses
    were ones his partner was living at and that this was  an  issue  which
    could have been cleared up at the hearing. Finally, Ms  Bond  submitted
    that the issue of rehabilitation was not featured at all in the judge's
    consideration and that this was a relevant factor, applying the guiding
    principles of Boultif.

14. Ms Everett argued that the judge did not err in repeatedly referring to
    the issue of who was the primary  carer  of  the  appellant's  children
    because the judge said several times that the appellant had  subsisting
    parental relationships with his children. It  was  inevitable  that  in
    looking at whether something is unduly harsh it is relevant to consider
    whether someone is the primary carer. Ms Everett submitted that because
    the appellant was not the primary carer, the separation  would  not  be
    unduly harsh and that this taken with the  other  findings  was  not  a
    perverse or unreasonable approach. As for the social  worker's  report,
    the judge was clearly aware of the conclusion that the best outcome was
    for the whole family to remain here together.  Regarding the  partner's
    circumstances, it was for the appellant to make out his  case  not  for
    the judge to wrestle with the partner's reasons why she  could  not  go
    with appellant to  Jamaica.  In  relation  to  the  quantity  of  drugs
    involved, Ms Everett accepted that the judge  was  mistaken  about  the
    quantity of drugs involved but argued that this would not have  changed
    the outcome.  Lastly, regarding the judge's  factual  error  about  the
    appellant's address, this was not a material error because she accepted
    there was a subsisting relationship between the appellant, his  partner
    and children.

15. In response, Ms Bond argued that the appellant's partner was  a  third-
    generation British citizen and had not been to Jamaica  since  she  was
    aged 10. The judge found that she had the  ability  to  adapt,  however
    there was no idea where that information came from.  The judge erred in
    finding that the appellant was not a primary  carer  and  therefore  by
    definition the unduly harsh test could not be met.

16. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision as  to  whether  there
    was an error of law.

Decision on error of law

17. Permission to appeal was granted owing to the judge's reliance  on  KMO
    at [39] of the decision. The judge directed herself  in  the  following
    manner by reproducing and applying [24] of KMO, including the following
    passage. "Therefore the word "unduly"  in  the  phrase  "unduly  harsh"
    requires consideration of whether, in the light of the  seriousness  of
    the offences committed by the foreign criminal and the public  interest
    consideration that come into play, the impact on the child, children or
    partner of the foreign  criminal  being  deported  is  inordinately  or
    excessively harsh."  At the time the appeal was  heard  on  8  February
    2019, the relevant authority was of course KO, the  judgment  of  which
    was given in October 2018.  At [40] of  First-tier  Tribunal  decision,
    the judge confirms that she would  be  taking  into  consideration  the
    "criminal history" in deciding the issue of unduly harshness.

18. The judge's reliance on a decision, the conclusions of which  had  been
    overtaken by a Supreme Court decision amounts to a clear error of  law.
    In considering whether the error  was  material,  it  is  necessary  to
    examine the issue of  the  judge's  view  of  the  seriousness  of  the
    appellant's offending. While this matter  did  not  form  part  of  the
    grounds of appeal, it is relevant to the judge's  findings  on  whether
    the appellant's deportation would result in unduly harsh  consequences,
    which wrongly included consideration of the extent  of  his  offending.
    From the incomplete documents contained in the respondent's bundle,  it
    appears that the appellant was caught with less than a gram of Class  A
    drugs, in total. That is significantly different from being caught with
    nearly a kilo of the same. It is the case that the judge was misled  by
    the pre-sentence report, however  there  is  an  obvious  inconsistency
    between the claim in that report that there was nearly a kilo of  drugs
    found and the claim that the street value of the drugs was �80. I  find
    that the judge erred in placing reliance  on  this  part  of  the  pre-
    sentence report and ought  to  have  scrutinised  this  issue  further.
    While, the judge ought not to have taken this  issue  into  account  in
    relation to the issue of unduly harshness in the first place, I  accept
    the argument  that  this  issue  contributed  to  the  judge's  overall
    findings. It is a matter of concern, that  the  appeal  was  determined
    with neither the full indictment nor the  complete  judge's  sentencing
    remarks before the judge.

19. I therefore conclude that the  judge's  reliance  on  KMO  as  well  as
    inaccurate information regarding the quantity of Class A drugs found in
    his possession amounts to a  material  error  of  law  which  justifies
    setting the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.

20. I will briefly consider the pleaded grounds  and  take  the  first  two
    grounds together. The judge concluded at [33] that the appellant had  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with all six of  his  children  but
    commented, more than once, that the appellant was not their main  carer
    in her findings as to whether the effect  of  the  appellant's  removal
    from the United Kingdom upon them would be unduly harsh.  At  [34]  the
    judge finds that the appellant is not the main carer  for  any  of  his
    children. An observation she makes again at [45] of the decision.

21. The appellant's evidence was that he lives with his  partner  and  they
    look after M and I together and individually when the other is at work.
     The finding that the appellant's partner is the  main  carer  resulted
    from the judge's view that there was contradictory  evidence  regarding
    the appellant's address. I was told that this was an  issue  which  was
    not raised with the representatives at the hearing and regarding  which
    an explanation could have been provided at the time.

22. I am satisfied that the judge misled herself in treating the  issue  of
    whether the appellant was or was not the main  carer  as  determinative
    when considering Article 8 under the Rules and section 117C of the 2002
    Act and, further that she conflated this  issue  with  that  of  unduly
    harshness.

23. The judge further erred in her consideration  of  unduly  harshness  in
    relation to the  appellant's  partner  in  that  there  were  no  clear
    findings, other than that she was the main carer of M and  I  and  that
    she was "resourceful" and a  "committed  mother."  At  [41]  the  judge
    states that the partner had given no specific reason why she would  not
    go to Jamaica with the appellant. At this point,  it  is  worth  noting
    that there is an explanation in her father's  witness  statement,  that
    being that the partner wishes to ensure that her children are  educated
    in the United Kingdom. This evidence was not considered by  the  judge.
    At [40] the judge makes  a  fleeting  reference  to  the  'Summary  and
    Conclusion' paragraph of the independent social  worker's  report,  but
    makes no assessment of the detailed opinion expressed  in  that  report
    which involved interviews with five of the appellant's six children  as
    well as the writer's expert opinion of the impact  of  the  appellant's
    deportation on his children.

24. The offences in question  occurred  in  2013  in  the  context  of  the
    appellant engaging in dealing to feed his addiction to  crack  cocaine.
    It was his first conviction and he has not offended  since.  The  judge
    failed to  take  into  account  the  evidence  before  her  as  to  the
    appellant's rehabilitation. This issue was favourably commented upon in
    the partial judge's sentencing remarks and  there  was  a  professional
    risk  assessment  available  in  the   form   of   an   OASys   report.
    Rehabilitation is one of the factors considered to be of importance  in
    an overall assessment of proportionality, applying Boultif as  well  as
    Garzon [2018] EWCA Civ 1225.

25. There is also the matter of the judge, at [28] acknowledging  that  the
    welfare of the children is a primary consideration,  but  not  applying
    this at [41], where she stated that "their best interests are only  one
    factor."

26. For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    vitiated by material errors of law. I set aside  the  decision  in  its
    entirety.

27. While mindful  of  statement  7  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statements of 10 February 2010, it is the case  that  the  evidence  on
    file  is  incomplete,  the  appellant  has  yet  to  have  an  adequate
    consideration of his appeal by the First-tier Tribunal and it would  be
    unfair to deprive him of such  consideration.  I  therefore  remit  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  de  novo  hearing,  with  no
    findings preserved.



Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

The appeal is remitted, de novo, to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  reheard
at Taylor House, with a time estimate of one day by any judge except  First-
tier Tribunal Judge Twydell.



Directions for de novo hearing

      1. The respondent is to file with the First-tier Tribunal and serve on
         the appellant a complete copy of the  indictment  and  the  judge's
         sentencing remarks no later than 28  days  before  the  substantive
         hearing of this appeal.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
