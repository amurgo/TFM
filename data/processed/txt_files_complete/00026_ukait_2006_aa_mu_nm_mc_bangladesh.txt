In an appeal under paragraph 135I of HC  395  (Sectors-Based  Work  Permits)
where no reliance is placed on paragraph 320:

   1) Neither the ECO nor the Tribunal is concerned with  whether  the  Work
      Permit should have been issued;
   2) it is not open to the ECO to base a  refusal  purely  on  generalities
      applicable to the Scheme as a whole;
   3) the burden of proof remains on the applicant even though he has a work
      permit;
   4) his intention  to  return  is  to  be  distinguished  from  motive  or
      incentive to return;
   5) an applicant who fails to give a coherent or consistent account of his
      proposed employment and circumstances in the UK may be found  to  have
      failed to discharge the burden of proof.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

  1. We have before us for reconsideration four appeals by Appellants  who,
     having obtained work permits under the Sectors-Based  Scheme,  sought,
     and were refused, entry clearance to the United Kingdom.

The Appellants

  2. The first Appellant (AA)  presented to the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,
     Dhaka, a work  permit  relating  to  proposed  employment  as  a  fish
     filleter in East India Cash and Carry Limited.   His  application  for
     entry clearance was refused on the ground  that  the  Entry  Clearance
     Officer was not satisfied that he intended to leave the United Kingdom
     at the end of his approved employment, because:

           "You  have  not  shown  that  you  have,  on  the   balance   of
           probabilities, sufficiently strong family,  social  or  economic
           ties in Bangladesh to satisfy me that you intend  to  leave  the
           United Kingdom on completion of your  twelve  months  employment
           because you are in unpaid employment, have  no  savings  and  no
           employment arranged for your return."

  3. The explanatory statement, prepared  as  usual  after  the  notice  of
     appeal was received, reads, so far as relevant, as follows:

           "I have considered all of the grounds given within the notice of
           appeal.  I note that no further documents have been presented in
           support of the appeal.  The Appellant stated that he has  strong
           economical  and  social  ties  in  Bangladesh.    However,   the
           Appellant is an unemployed single man with no income, assets  or
           savings.  He did not complete  the  employment  details  on  the
           application form, but stated during his interview that he helped
           his father in his fishery.  He presented no  evidence  of  this.
           He is financially supported by his father  and  lives  with  his
           parents, four sisters and three brothers.  He  lives  in  a  tin
           walled house with a tin roof and  concrete  floor.   He  has  no
           commitments or ties in Bangladesh.  The Entry Clearance  Officer
           considered that the  Appellant  was  aware  of  the  ability  to
           support his family from his significantly higher income  in  the
           UK.  The Entry Clearance Officer could not be satisfied that the
           Appellant would leave the United Kingdom after his one year stay
           and all the financial benefits and ability to support his family
           that would come with working there."

  4. The Adjudicator, Mr N Paul, heard oral evidence from the sponsor,  the
     Appellant's proposed employer.  After hearing submissions, he set  out
     his task, as he saw it, in his determination as follows:

           "This is a case where the ECO based  in  Dhaka  was  in  a  good
           position to make an assessment as  to  the  bona  fides  of  the
           application.  However, as Mr Ahmed pointed out,  mere  suspicion
           is not sufficient.  The question is  what  is  the  evidence  to
           support this application and has the Appellant demonstrated on a
           balance of probabilities  that  he  is  genuinely  intending  to
           return to Bangladesh at the end  of  twelve  months.   Whilst  I
           respect the ECO's decision, I can review it if  I  am  satisfied
           that he  has  either  misdirected  himself  or  there  is  fresh
           material not before him which casts light and substantiates  the
           application."

  5. The Adjudicator went on to say  that  he  was  not  persuaded  by  the
     sponsor's evidence.

           "In this case, I have to say that I  am  not  satisfied  by  the
           evidence provided by the sponsor.  First of  all,  no  documents
           were produced to show that he had placed advertisements in local
           newspapers and I found it amazing that the solicitor  instructed
           to attend did not have the file with him, bearing in  mind  that
           it would clearly have demonstrated  the  sponsor's  bona  fides.
           Furthermore, neither  in  the  sponsor's  statement  or  in  the
           Appellant's statement is there any information  provided  as  to
           accommodation.  The first time this  was  raised  was  when  the
           sponsor said that accommodation would be provided  free  in  the
           business premises.  There was no contract of employment.   There
           was no business plan with  regard  to  how  much  the  Appellant
           expected to earn and be able to send back to Bangladesh.   There
           was no statement as to the cost of the trip and how  that  would
           be funded.


           As indicated above, the sponsor did not convince  me  that  this
           application was genuine.  In particular, I was not satisfied  as
           to his assertion that the hours were long and hard and  that  no
           British citizens would take up this kind  of  employment.   When
           asked about the hours, he said it was forty hours which  is  the
           national standard.  Extra hours would be required  as  and  when
           necessary.   There   was   nothing   exceptional   about   that.
           Furthermore,  there  was  nothing  intrinsically  unsatisfactory
           about the job that would mean that local Asian people would  not
           apply for it.  It is well known that in the East End  of  London
           with the large businesses involved in catering, that many people
           work in that type of industry and there is nothing special about
           this type of job to indicate that people  working  generally  in
           the catering industry would not apply for this type of work."

      He concluded as follows:


           "Therefore, having regard to the matters considered by  the  ECO
           and the matters I reviewed above, I  am  not  satisfied  on  the
           balance of probabilities that  the  Appellant  has  demonstrated
           that he will comply with the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
           Rules."


  6. Thus he dismissed the appeal.

  7. The grounds for reconsideration assert that the Adjudicator  erred  in
     the approach that he took to the appeal, and  that  his  determination
     went well beyond a consideration of the Appellant's intention to leave
     the United Kingdom at the end of the approved  employment,  which  was
     the only issue before him.

  8. The second Appellant (MFU) presented to the Entry Clearance Officer  a
     work permit relating to proposed employment as a cleaner for Raj Mahal
     Royal Indian Takeaway in Northolt.  His entry clearance was refused in
     terms that are substantially identical to those in  the  case  of  the
     first Appellant, save that  in  his  case  the  reference  to  "unpaid
     employment" was replaced  by  "low  paid  employment"  and  the  Entry
     Clearance Officer added that the Appellant had no qualifications.  The
     explanatory statement adds the following:

           "It is a requirement of the  Immigration  Rules  that  a  Sector
           Based Work Permit Holder 'intends to leave the United Kingdom at
           the end of his work permit'.  This  is  also  a  requirement  of
           paragraph 17(e) of the conditions governing  the  issue  of  the
           work permit.  I am aware that given the lack of ability  of  the
           authorising officer to accurately assess this in  the  UK,  then
           this task falls to the ECO at post.


           The Appellant's monthly income in the  UK  would  be  @  �717.60
           before stoppages (78,936 taka) [exchange rate of 110 Taka =  �1]
           which is 44 times the average income  of  1,800  taka  that  the
           Appellant claims to earn in Bangladesh.   Bearing  in  mind  the
           circumstances of the  Appellant,  in  Bangladesh,  my  colleague
           could not be satisfied that the Appellant would leave the UK, at
           the end of his work permit with the significant higher income to
           return to Bangladesh and a life  close  to  the  poverty  limit.
           Clearly the  personal  circumstances  of  an  individual  is  an
           important aspect of any application to consider  whether  it  is
           probable that they would leave the UK and return to  their  life
           from where they had come.


           Migratory pressures on persons from Bangladesh are  more  severe
           than those from a lot  of  other  countries.   Bangladesh  is  a
           desperately poor country with  political  instability  and  very
           limited opportunities for those who do not belong to the  ruling
           or business elite.  Almost 50% of the population live below  the
           national poverty line  (UNDP  Human  Development  Report  2004).
           When considering applications of this nature, ECOs  have  to  be
           satisfied that, on completion of the work permit, the  applicant
           will leave the  UK.   An  ECO  has  to  be  satisfied  that  the
           applicant has sufficient incentive to leave the UK at the end of
           time limit so in this respect, the situation  in  Bangladesh  is
           very relevant to the ECO's deliberations."

  9.  The  Appellant's  appeal  against  that  decision  was  heard  by  an
     Immigration Judge, Dr K F Walters, on 2 August 2005.   He  heard  oral
     evidence from the sponsor.  He also had before him a statement by  the
     Appellant, which reads, in part, as follows:

           "It is obviously true that I am in low paid  employment  but  it
           does not mean that as I am in low paid employment  there  is  no
           possibility of my returning in Bangladesh at the end of approved
           employment.  If my financial condition  were  good,  it  is  not
           necessary to go abroad to earn money by hard labour.  However, I
           have inheritance on my father's huge properties, two  houses  on
           1.2 acres and 5.8 acres arable land, two fisheries  etc.   If  I
           get the visa, there is a possibility to  earn  more  than  8,000
           pounds which is equivalent to more than  800,000  taka.   As  my
           employer has declared that he will provide my accommodation  and
           food I will be able to save my earned money.  I  have  a  future
           plan to set up a restaurant.  I will set up a business with  the
           saved money and I am confident that I will be able  to  maintain
           my family with the income of my business.  So I do not  need  to
           breach the immigration rules to maintain  my  family.   The  ECO
           raised the question on my ties in Bangladesh and my  opinion  on
           the remark is that I have all my family  members  in  Bangladesh
           and no one of my close relative lives in the UK.  So I have  not
           any reason and way to  stay  there  illegally.   My  father  and
           mother are in elderly age and I have also responsibility to look
           after them.  Above all, the bond of love in  Bangladeshi  family
           is the main reason to stay jointly.  And  we  live  in  a  joint
           family.  And I have no intention to stay permanently  in  abroad
           without my family members."

 10. The Immigration Judge reached  the  conclusion  that  the  Appellant's
     circumstances must be described as modest.  He regarded the sponsor as
     credible but noted that he knew little or  nothing  of  the  Appellant
     other  than  from  one  telephone  conversation.   He  concluded   his
     determination as follows:

           "It is  against  such  a  backcloth  that  the  Appellant  seeks
           employment in the United Kingdom, as a cleaner,  in  a  takeaway
           restaurant, where he would earn significantly more money than is
           possible for him in Bangladesh.  According to the Appellant, and
           his sponsor, with the provision of free food  and  accommodation
           in the United Kingdom, the Appellant would be able to save  much
           of the money earned by him  in  the  United  Kingdom  and,  upon
           return  to  Bangladesh,  could  open  his  own  small  business.
           However, upon his own admission, the Appellant has  no  business
           experience,  much  of  his  experience  to  date,  and  for  the
           immediate future, centring upon his ability  to  clean  business
           premises.   I  have  concluded  that  the  Appellant's   claimed
           aspirations are wholly unrealistic and lack credibility.


           Taken in the  round,  I  do  not  consider  this  Appellant  has
           demonstrated that, having regard to all  the  circumstances  set
           out herein,  there  is  any  incentive  for  him  to  return  to
           Bangladesh on completion of sector based employment.


           The burden of proof remains upon the  Appellant.   Applying  the
           relevant law to the established facts, and on  the  totality  of
           the evidence adduced before me, I find that  the  Appellant  has
           not discharged the burden of proof  and  reasons  given  by  the
           Respondent do justify the refusal.  The Respondent's decision is
           in accordance with the law and the  Rules,  and  the  appeal  is
           accordingly dismissed."

 11. The grounds for reconsideration  assert  that  the  Immigration  Judge
     placed too much  emphasis  on  incentives  to  return  and  failed  to
     consider properly the Appellant's intention.  They point out  that  at
     his interview (as distinct from his statement which we  have  set  out
     above) the Appellant said that his intention on return was to  open  a
     grocery shop in the local market, which would not  be  an  unrealistic
     proposition.  Further, the grounds assert that the  Immigration  Judge
     failed to note the overwhelming family ties that the Appellant has  in
     Bangladesh.

 12. The third Appellant (NM) presented a work permit relating to  proposed
     employment as a kitchen assistant at K2 Takeaway in  Bolton.   He  was
     refused entry clearance on the ground  that  the  Respondent  was  not
     satisfied that he was capable of undertaking the employment stated  on
     the work permit, that he did not intend to take other employment, that
     he would be able to maintain and accommodation  himself,  or  that  he
     intended to leave the United  Kingdom  at  the  end  of  his  approved
     employment.  The reasons are stated  in  the  notice  of  decision  as
     follows:

           "I accept that you have been issued  an  immigration  employment
           document by Work Permits  UK  under  the  Sector  Based  Scheme.
           However, you could not even give me a credible  account  of  how
           you obtained the job.  I would expect anyone proposing  to  move
           abroad to work to have  at  least  some  knowledge  about  their
           future employment.  Your failure to take any  interest  in  your
           claimed employment leads me to conclude that you have obtained a
           work permit to secure your entry to the UK and as a result, I am
           not satisfied that you intend to take employment as specified on
           your work permit as required by Rule 135I(iv) of HC 395.   I  am
           therefore not satisfied that you will be able  to  maintain  and
           accommodate yourself in the UK without have recourse  to  public
           funds as required by Rule 135I(v) of HC 395.


           You are in very low paid employment earning only 5,000 Rupees  a
           month.  You own no land, savings or assets in  your  own  right.
           You are an unmarried male of  marriageable  age  and  I  am  not
           satisfied that you are settled or established here at this time,
           or that you have shown sufficiently  strong  family,  social  or
           economic ties to Pakistan.  Coupled with this, in  view  of  the
           substantial economic benefits that you can expect in the  UK,  I
           am not satisfied that you intend to leave the UK after the  year
           specified on your sector based work permit as required  by  Rule
           135I(vi) of HC 395."

 13. There are extensive  grounds  of  appeal,  to  which  the  explanatory
     statement responds by reasserting  the  reasons  for  refusal  in  the
     following terms:

           "The Appellant has failed to address the issues  raised  in  the
           APP 200 and although I accept that  no  previous  experience  is
           required to do the work involved I am  not  satisfied  that  the
           Appellant will not take work other than that  specified  on  his
           work permit.  Nor am I satisfied that the Appellant will be able
           to maintain and accommodate himself without recourse  to  public
           funds or that he will leave the UK at  the  end  of  the  period
           specified in his work permit."

 14. The Appellant's appeal was heard by an Immigration  Judge,  Miss  Jane
     Plumptre,  on  7  September  2005.   She  considered  the  documentary
     evidence.  She heard no oral evidence.   The  Home  Office  Presenting
     Officer before her made a submission that it was unfortunate that  the
     Appellant's proposed employer did not attend  to  give  oral  evidence
     because he would have been able to explain the  terms  of  employment,
     his reason for  choosing  the  Appellant  as  his  employee,  and  any
     financial arrangements for the Appellant's return to Pakistan.  In her
     consideration of the evidence and of Mrs Chowdhury's submissions,  the
     Immigration Judge noted the terms of the employer's statement as  well
     as the documents emanating from  the  Appellant.   She  observed  that
     there was a discrepancy in the arrangements for accommodation, in that
     the Appellant said  that  his  employer  would  give  him  four  weeks
     residence and accommodation, whereas his employer said that  he  would
     give  the  Appellant  one  week's  paid  leave  in   order   to   find
     accommodation.  The Immigration Judge said that in view  of  what  the
     employer had said, there was no satisfactory evidence before her about
     where the Appellant would live on his arrival in the  United  Kingdom:
     she thought that he would have  difficulty  finding  accommodation  in
     Bolton as he spoke only Punjabi.

 15. The Immigration Judge went on to make a finding that the employer  did
     not take any steps to satisfy himself that the Appellant  was  capable
     of undertaking the job of kitchen assistant, a  job  about  which  the
     Appellant evidently knew rather little.  After  consideration  of  the
     arrangements leading up to the issue of the work permit, she wrote:

           "In all the circumstances, I find that the Appellant has himself
           initiated arrangements with the help of his brother to obtain  a
           work permit in order to gain entry to the United Kingdom and not
           because he intends to take  employment  specified  in  the  work
           permit as required by Rule 135I(iv) of the Immigration Rules."

 16. Referring to the document produced  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  as
     evidence of his employment in Pakistan, the Immigration Judge took the
     view that the restaurant in question was "a  family  concern"  because
     the proprietor and managing director had, like the Appellant, the name
     "Mehmood".  She noted that there appeared  to  have  been  no  contact
     between that restaurant and the Appellant's  prospective  employer  in
     the United Kingdom and that  the  letter  made  no  reference  to  the
     Appellant's earnings.  She added that there was no evidence about  how
     the Appellant's return fare would be paid.  She noted that the absence
     of the employer indicated that he was not willing to attend  in  order
     to confirm what he  said  in  his  witness  statement,  in  particular
     relating to accommodation.  Furthermore, the Immigration  Judge  could
     find no evidence of any proposed employment on the Appellant's  return
     and finally noted that his income in Pakistan was so  modest  that  he
     required financial assistance from his father and brother.

 17. For these reasons, the Immigration Judge found that the Appellant  had
     not met the requirements of the Immigration Rules and so dismissed the
     Appellant's appeal.

 18. The grounds for reconsideration assert that the inconsistency relating
     to employment, the lack of previous experience, the arrangements  made
     by his brother to obtain the employment, the absence of  the  proposed
     employer and the absence of evidence relating to the return  fare  are
     all irrelevant and that the Immigration Judge had failed to direct her
     mind to the true issues between the Appellant and the Respondent.

 19. The fourth Appellant  (MMAC)  presented  a  work  permit  relating  to
     proposed  employment  at  Indian  Summer,  a  restaurant  in  Newquay,
     Cornwall.  His application was refused on the ground  that  the  Entry
     Clearance Officer was not satisfied that he met  the  requirements  of
     paragraph 135I, in particular that he intended  to  leave  the  United
     Kingdom at the end of his approved employment, because:

           "You claim to have been employed  for  almost  1�  years  as  an
           office clerk with an income of 4000 taka (�40 using 100 taka  to
           the � exchange rate) per month.   You  live  in  a  brick  built
           house, tin roof and water from a motor.  Your  circumstances  in
           Bangladesh appear to be modest if not poor.  However,  you  have
           passed your SC and you  have  a  job,  which  would  allow  your
           progression.  You were unable to inform me which experiences  as
           a bar man would assist you on your return  to  Bangladesh.   You
           must also be aware of the ability to support  your  family  from
           your income in the UK.  I cannot  be  satisfied  that  you  will
           leave the United Kingdom after your 1  year  stay  and  all  the
           financial benefits that would come with working there.


           Your monthly income in the UK would be �650 (63,000 taka)  which
           is 16 times your present claimed monthly wage.  I could  not  be
           satisfied that you would  leave  the  UK  with  the  significant
           higher income to return to Bangladesh to return to your  present
           employment.  I am also not satisfied  that  your  employer  will
           leave your position vacant for 12 months until your return.


           You claimed that the main reason for going to the UK was to earn
           money.  However, you were unaware what your income would be  per
           week or per month only the hourly rate of �4.50, which had  been
           written on the papers.  It does not seem credible that you would
           not have calculated your financial benefits from this trip given
           the only reason was financial."


 20. The explanatory statement adds the following:

           "... no further documents have been presented in support of  the
           appeal.  the representatives of the Appellant  stated  that  the
           Appellant's  circumstances  should  not   be   considered   when
           considering such a case. However, they have failed to  draw  any
           attention to the Immigration Rules Paragraph 135I(vi), which  it
           clearly states that 'you intend to leave the United  Kingdom  at
           the end of your approved employment'.  The Appellant claimed  to
           be employed as an officer clerk since August 2002 and  receiving
           an income equivalent to �37 per  month.   The  Appellant  stated
           that he would return to his current employment  after  his  one-
           year of employment.  The Appellant presented no evidence of  any
           employment, income or proof that his employer will re-employ him
           on his return.  The Appellant lives with his parents and brother
           and the Appellant is a single man with  no  savings,  assets  or
           commitments  in  Bangladesh.   The   Entry   Clearance   Officer
           considered that the  Appellant  was  aware  of  the  ability  to
           support his family from his significantly higher income  in  the
           UK.  The Entry Clearance Officer could not be satisfied that the
           Appellant would leave the United Kingdom after his one year stay
           and all the  financial  benefits  and  ability  to  support  his
           family, that would come with working  there.   Furthermore,  the
           Entry  Clearance  Officer  could  not  be  satisfied  that   the
           Appellant would leave the UK with the significant higher  income
           to return to Bangladesh to further low  wages  and  poor  living
           conditions.


           The representatives have stated  that  Work  Permits  (UK)  have
           authorised the work permit having already vetted the application
           for a work permit.  However, Work Permits (UK) do  not  consider
           the Immigration Rules when vetting any work  permit  application
           and in particular applicants intentions to leave the UK  at  the
           end of one year.   This  is  the  job  of  the  Entry  Clearance
           Officer, at the post overseas.  Therefore, Work Permits  vetting
           and issue of a work permit does not give an automatic  right  to
           enter the UK.  The applicant in this case  has  to  satisfy  the
           Immigration Rules.


           The representatives have also stated or implied that as  of  1st
           May 2004 with the change in rules that employers would no longer
           employ a person aged 16 and over due  to  it  being  a  criminal
           offence and a �5000 fine payable if the person was  'subject  to
           immigration control'.  To imagine that as from 1st May 2004 that
           there is no potential or there  is  no  longer  persons  working
           illegally in breach of their immigration conditions  appears  to
           me to be na�ve in the extreme."

 21. The Appellant's appeal was heard by  an  Immigration  Judge,  Mr  I  S
     Kulatilake, on 26 September 2005.  He noted the material  before  him,
     in particular the submission by the  Appellant's  representative  that
     the Entry Clearance Officer's decision was  based  on  suspicion.   He
     rejected that submission, writing as follows:

           "However,  the  ECO's  concerns  were  not  entirely  based   on
           suspicion, and he was right to consider how  his  employment  in
           the UK would assist him on his return to Bangladesh.  Mrs Haroon
           submitted, that the bar skills he would learn, in the  UK  would
           be readily marketable in the 'star grade hotels in  Bangladesh'.
           However, when the  Appellant  was  questioned  at  interview  he
           stated his experience in the UK, would assist him on his  return
           to his  present  employment  as  an  office  clerk  in  an  auto
           business.  And if the Appellant as Mrs Haroon submitted  was  to
           use his experience in the UK as a barman, to  obtain  employment
           in that field in a hotel on his return, he should have said  so.
           He did  not,  and  neither  was  he  able  to  explain  how  his
           experience in the UK would assist him to better himself  in  his
           current employment, if he  was  not  returning  to  his  current
           employment.


           I find in the circumstances the ECO was  entitled  to  draw  the
           inference, that the Appellant is not  being  honest  as  to  his
           reasons for applying under the SBS, and accordingly  doubt  that
           the Appellant does intend to leave the UK  at  the  end  of  the
           year's employment.


           It is also to be observed from his interview, the Appellant  has
           an uncle in the UK.  Mrs Haroon was unable to assist  me  as  to
           the uncle's circumstances in the UK.  For example how he  gained
           entry to the UK, as to how long he has been in the UK etcetera.


           I accept Mr Choudhury, the proprietor of the restaurant, when he
           expresses, that he would  do  everything  that  is  possible  to
           ensure the Appellant will return to Bangladesh at the end of the
           year.  Nevertheless it  appears,  the  Appellant  has  not  been
           entirely transparent with him, when he stated, that he is coming
           to the UK to acquire new skills and experience.  As  I  observed
           earlier when the skills he would acquire and the experience as a
           barman he would gain in the UK will not be of assistance  if  he
           expecting to return to his job as a clerk."

 22. Thus the Immigration Judge dismissed  the  appeal.   The  grounds  for
     reconsideration assert that the Immigration  Judge  erred  in  placing
     emphasis on whether the Appellant would, on his return, have any  real
     use for  skills  learnt  in  the  United  Kingdom,  in  identifying  a
     discrepancy in the evidence relating to the use  the  Appellant  would
     make of his new skills (because the discrepancy, if  any,  arose  from
     the oratory of his  representative)  and  in  apparently  taking  into
     account the existence of the Appellant's uncle in the United Kingdom.

The hearing

 23. We have considered all the documentary material  before  us  in  these
     four appeals.  We heard submissions from Mr Taj on behalf of the first
     Appellant, Mr Rossier on behalf of the second Appellant, Mrs Chowdhury
     on behalf of the third Appellant and Mr Vale on behalf of  both  Entry
     Clearance Officers.  The fourth Appellant did not appear and  was  not
     represented before us.

The Sectors-Based Scheme

 24. There is no dispute between the parties about the terms of the Sectors-
     Based Scheme.  Information  about  it  is  most  readily  obtained  at
     www.workingintheuk.gov.uk to  which  the  parties  referred  us.   The
     Sectors-Based  Scheme  gives  to  employers  who  have  difficulty  in
     recruiting  staff  in  certain  specified  sectors  of  industry   the
     possibility of recruiting from outside the EEA.  It has the incidental
     effect that it gives to certain workers from countries outside the EEA
     the opportunity to work in the United Kingdom:   but  the  reason  for
     that is the assistance they will thereby give to  the  United  Kingdom
     economy.  It is  not  primarily  intended  to  benefit  the  immigrant
     worker.

 25. When it was introduced, the  scheme  was  applied  to  two  sectors  -
     hospitality and food manufacturing.  The number of  permits  available
     is limited by quota.  The quota allocation for the hospitality  sector
     was soon exhausted and the hospitality sector was withdrawn on 30 June
     2005.  In order to give an impression of the types of job to which the
     Sectors-Based Scheme applies, we list the posts which are now  covered
     in the food manufacturing industry.  They are as follows:

           Fish
           .      Fish  filleters  (prepares,   cleans,   cuts   fish   for
           processing);
           .     Fish packers (packing, wrapping,  labelling,  sealing,  by
                 hand or machine, fish for distribution and sale);  and
           .     Fish process operatives (operating, minding  and  cleaning
                 machines that prepare fish for distribution and sale).
           Meat
           .     Animal gut remover;
           .     Meat bone breaker;
           .     Meat bone extractor;
           .     Meat cold store operator;
           .     Meat cutter;
           .     Meat packer;
           .     Meat process operatives;
           .     Meat slaughterer;
           .     Lairageman (pre-slaughter animal welfare attendant);  and
           .     Trimmer (trims fat from and shapes meat, after it has been
                 boned and cut).
           General
           .     Mushroom processor (tends growing crops, picks, grades and
                 packs mushrooms for distribution and sale)

 26. Because of the nature  of  the  scheme,  the  application  process  is
     initiated by the employer (not the worker) and the employer retains  a
     considerable measure of responsibility for anybody  he  employs  under
     the scheme.  In order to apply for a work permit for a non-EEA  worker
     under the scheme, an employer has to satisfy 'Work Permits  (UK)',  an
     agency of the Home Office, that he is running a  genuine  business  in
     accordance with UK law, that  he  has  a  genuine  vacancy,  that  the
     vacancy is full-time and will be paid at a rate lawful in the UK,  and
     that he has been unable to fill it from the workforce available in the
     UK and the EEA.  In order to satisfy 'Work Permits (UK)' on  the  last
     matter, he has to prove that it has been advertised in the UK  and  in
     the EEA, give  details  of  the  applicants  and  say  why  they  were
     unsuitable.  It is only if 'Work Permits (UK)' are  satisfied  on  all
     these matters that they will go on  to  consider  arrangements  for  a
     specified individual worker recruited from outside the  UK.   He  will
     need to be between eighteen and thirty and able to do  the  job;   his
     employer needs to  provide  accommodation  or  provide  facilities  to
     assist him in obtaining accommodation.  If  'Work  Permits  (UK)'  are
     satisfied on all these matters, a work permit will be issued.   It  is
     limited to  the  named  individual,  the  named  post  and  the  named
     employer;  it allows employment only for a maximum period of one  year
     (there has to be an absence from the UK of at least two months  before
     the same individual can undertake further sectors based work)  and  it
     does not entitle the worker to bring any other members of  his  family
     or dependants with him.

 27. The work permit also does not  entitle  the  prospective  employee  to
     admission.  A person seeking admission to the United Kingdom under the
     Sectors-Based Scheme needs entry clearance, which he has to obtain, as
     usual, from the British Embassy or High Commission in his country.  An
     entry clearance will  only  be  issued  if  the  applicant  meets  the
     requirements in paragraph 135I  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  HC  395.
     Those requirements are that he:

           "(i)  holds a valid Home Office immigration employment  document
                 issued under the Sectors-Based Scheme;  and
           (ii)  is not of an age which puts him  outside  the  limits  for
           employment;  and
           (iii) is capable of undertaking the employment specified in  the
                 immigration employment document;  and
           (iv)  does not intend to take employment except as specified  in
                 his immigration employment document;  and
           (v)   is able to maintain  and  accommodate  himself  adequately
                 without recourse to public funds;  and
           (vi)  intends to leave the United Kingdom  at  the  end  of  his
                 approved employment."

 28. It will be observed, therefore, that the  process  has  two  principal
     stages.  The first is that leading up to the issue of the work permit.
      If the application by the employer is unsuccessful at that stage,  no
     work permit will be issued.  The second stage leads up to the  use  of
     the work permit.  The prospective employee has to show that  he  meets
     the requirements of the Immigration Rules to enable him to come to the
     United Kingdom in order to do the work which the  work  permit  allows
     him to do.  The decision-maker at the first  stage  is  'Work  Permits
     (UK)'.  The decision-maker at the second stage is the Entry  Clearance
     Officer.  Their roles are quite different.  As paragraph 135I(i) makes
     clear, the possession of a work permit  is  one  of  the  requirements
     before entry clearance  can  be  granted;   but  the  Entry  Clearance
     Officer has no role in enquiring into whether  a  work  permit  should
     have been issued.  If there is a work permit, the appellant meets  the
     requirements of paragraph 135I(i).

Immigration appeals and the Sectors-Based Scheme

 29. Appeals relating to the Sectors-Based Scheme  come  to  this  Tribunal
     only by way of  an  appeal  by  the  prospective  employee  against  a
     decision, normally by an Entry Clearance Officer,  that  he  does  not
     meet the requirements of paragraph 135I.  The appeal has to be limited
     to the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.   It  is  not  for  the
     Tribunal to attempt to decide whether a work permit should  have  been
     issued.  Although  it  is  conceivable  that  the  Tribunal  might  be
     assisted by the evidence of the prospective  employer,  it  is  always
     necessary to remember that the employer's evidence is relevant to  the
     appeal only insofar as it goes to the appellant's ability  to  satisfy
     the  requirements  of  the   Immigration   Rules.    The   appellant's
     immigration appeal is not the place to  decide  whether  the  employer
     really has a vacancy suitable to be filled from abroad.

 30. The Adjudicator in the first  Appellant's  appeal  before  us  clearly
     erred in law in basing his dismissal of the appeal in part at least on
     his dissatisfaction with the evidence provided by the employer leading
     up to the issue of the work permit.   The  Immigration  Judge  in  the
     appeal of the third Appellant alluded to the absence of oral  evidence
     from the employer, but we do not consider that she erred in law in her
     consideration of the impact of the evidence as a whole.  It  is  clear
     from her determination that she  was  considering  evidence  that  the
     employer might have given only in the light of the Appellant's ability
     to meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  relating  to  his
     capability to do the job, his intention to do it, and  his  access  to
     accommodation.

 31. Just as the Tribunal is not concerned with matters going to the  issue
     of the work permit itself, so the Entry Clearance Officer  ought  not,
     in our judgment, to be concerned with matters that are a pre-condition
     to the issue of the work permit.  All applicants under paragraph  135I
     are young, because the scheme is limited to those between eighteen and
     thirty.  All of them are likely to be without dependants, because  the
     scheme does not allow dependants to accompany the worker to the United
     Kingdom.  All will be earning at least thirty  times  the  UK  minimum
     hourly wage per week, because it is a requirement of the  scheme  that
     the worker be employed for at least thirty hours per week at a  lawful
     wage.  All are people  who  are  prepared  to  undertake  low  skilled
     unattractive employment, because the scheme is limited to  such  jobs.
     Taking any of  those  factors  against  an  applicant  is  similar  to
     enquiring into the issue of the work permit.

 32. Further, it is quite wrong for an Entry Clearance Officer  to  assume,
     from the fact that the scheme will offer the applicant an opportunity,
     during the year that he is lawfully employed under it,  to  make  what
     may by his standards be a  considerable  amount  of  money,  that  the
     applicant will thereafter seek to work unlawfully.  That is equivalent
     to an assumption that anyone who has  the  opportunity  to  commit  an
     offence will do so.   Nor  should  Entry  Clearance  Officers  confuse
     actual intention with apparent motive.  The fact that an applicant has
     no apparent economic reason to return to his own country does not mean
     that he has no intention of returning to his own country at the end of
     his employment.

 33. In that context, it seems to us also that the poverty of  the  country
     from which the applicant comes is  also  a  matter  which  is  not  of
     relevance to the Entry Clearance Officer's decision.  If one dismisses
     from one's mind the suspicion that the application is being made  only
     in order to enable the  applicant  to  overstay,  a  great  difference
     between his income in his own country and the income he will obtain in
     the United Kingdom merely makes it  more  explicable  that  he  should
     inconvenience himself by going abroad and by doing an unattractive job
     in order to earn it.

 34. It follows also that entry clearance applications cannot  properly  be
     refused on the  basis  of  generalities  that  may  originate  from  a
     disapproval of the scheme and a suspicion of abuse.  Each applicant is
     entitled  to  individual   consideration   of   his   own   individual
     circumstances  and  individual  intentions.   If  the  application  is
     refused, the notice of refusal and the explanatory statement must show
     that the refusal was based not on a generalised  suspicion  but  on  a
     proper evaluation of the appellant's evidence.

 35. That said, the burden of proof is on the  appellant  both  before  the
     Entry Clearance Officer and in any subsequent appeal.  It is  for  the
     appellant to  demonstrate  that  he  meets  the  requirements  of  the
     Immigration Rules.  It is notoriously  difficult  to  prove  intention
     but, as in any other area of immigration law, an applicant who appears
     not to have any clear and consistent idea of the facts, or who appears
     not  to  be  telling  the  truth,  should  not  be  surprised  if  his
     declaration of his  intentions  is  not  believed.   If  on  important
     matters  there  are   contradictions   in   his   own   evidence,   or
     inconsistencies between what he says and what the prospective employer
     says, it may be very difficult for  the  applicant  to  discharge  the
     burden of proof.  And although the reasons for the issue of  the  work
     permit are not a  matter  for  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  or  the
     Tribunal, it is a central feature of the application  that  it  is  in
     order to enable the applicant to do a specific  job  with  a  specific
     employer in a specific place in the United Kingdom.   The  applicant's
     case is that he has been recruited for that purpose.  It is  therefore
     by no means unreasonable to expect him to have a knowledge of what  it
     is that he is going to do.

Reconsideration

 36.  In AA's case, the Adjudicator erred, as we have explained, in  basing
     his decision partly on his views about whether the work permit  should
     have been issued at all.  That was  a  material  error  of  law.   The
     Adjudicator also erred in his approach to his task.  We have  set  out
     the relevant passage  of  his  determination  in  paragraph  4  above.
     Regardless of the Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision,  it  was  the
     Adjudicator's task to look at the matter afresh as it was at the  date
     of the decision and reach his own conclusion on whether the  Appellant
     met the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.   That  was  also  a
     material error of law.

 37. This is a case in  which  the  Appellant  gave  full  details  of  his
     application to the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.   The  Entry  Clearance
     Officer's  ground  for  refusing  him  rely  solely  on  generalities,
     suspicion, and the lack of motive  (as  distinct  from  intention)  to
     return.  We must assume that the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  found  no
     other reason for refusing the application.   Before  the  Adjudicator,
     there were  no  contradictions  in  the  evidence  on  employment  and
     accommodation, both of which were matters going to the  issue  of  the
     work permit.  Looking at the matter as a whole, we take the view  that
     AA met the requirements of the Immigration Rules and in  his  case  we
     substitute a determination allowing his appeal.

 38. The Entry Clearance Officer's refusal of the application of the second
     Appellant, MFU, was based on generalities, suspicion, and  an  absence
     of motive to return.  The Immigration Judge in this  case  appears  to
     have endorsed that reasoning, whilst possibly ignoring the evidence of
     incentive to return set out by the Appellant in his statement.  In our
     view, the Immigration Judge materially erred in law.  He did, however,
     point out that the Appellant's "plan to set up a restaurant", to which
     he  refers  in  his  statement,  seems  somewhat   impractical.    The
     Immigration Judge does not appear to have  specifically  compared  the
     statement with the interview (mentioning the plan to set up  a  market
     stall);  if he had done, he  might  have  decided  that  there  was  a
     material inconsistency.

 39. We think that would have been harsh.  It is not a requirement  of  the
     Immigration Rules that the applicant have a firm or coherent  business
     plan for his life after his return from Sectors-Based  work.   In  our
     view, the difference between the two stated long-term intentions is an
     inconsistency, but it is not material.  It does not appear that  there
     was any other reason for considering that this Appellant had  not  met
     the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Looking at the matter as a
     whole, we are satisfied that at the date of the decision he  did  meet
     those requirements  and  we  accordingly  substitute  a  determination
     allowing his appeal.

 40. In the case of the third Appellant, NM, the Entry Clearance  Officer's
     reasons for refusal were only partly generalised, and were  not  based
     solely on lack of intention to leave the United  Kingdom.   The  Entry
     Clearance Officer noted that this Appellant failed to give a  credible
     account of why his prospective employer had chosen him.  As a  result,
     the refusal was under sub-paragraphs (iv) and (v) as well as (vi).  We
     have already indicated our view that the Immigration Judge did not err
     in her approach to the lack of evidence relating to  employment.   She
     did err in two of her conclusions which were based on no evidence  and
     verge on the irrational.  One was that a person speaking only  Punjabi
     would have difficulty in finding employment in Bolton -  which  has  a
     large Punjabi community - and the other was that  the  name  "Mehmood"
     shared by three people suggests that they are related.   We  can  only
     suppose that that conclusion was based  on  some  imagined  patronymic
     system, and despite  the  fact  that  the  document  from  which  this
     conclusion is derived (the letter from  the  restaurant)  states  also
     that the Appellant's own father's  name  was  not  Mehmood  but  Allah
     Ditta.  Those errors were material:  if the Immigration Judge had  not
     made them, she might well have come to a different conclusion  on  the
     availability of accommodation and on the Appellant's circumstances  in
     his own country.

 41. We have therefore looked at the matter afresh, with the  advantage  of
     Ms  Chowdhury's  submissions.   We   consider,   however,   that   the
     difficulties about the  employment  and  accommodation  still  remain.
     There is still  no  satisfactory  explanation  for  why  the  employer
     proposed to employ this Appellant, who appears  to  know  very  little
     about the employment he proposes to undertake.  Furthermore, so far as
     accommodation is concerned, although we take the view  that  a  person
     who spoke only Punjabi would be able to negotiate for accommodation in
     Bolton, there is no evidence  to  show  what  accommodation  would  be
     available to the Appellant, whether it would be adequate, and  whether
     he would be able to afford it from his modest wages.   The  difference
     between the Appellant (who thought  that  accommodation  was  provided
     with the job) and the employer  (who  proposed  simply  to  allow  the
     Appellant time off in order to find accommodation) tends to show  that
     no serious thought has been given to the question and  tends  also  to
     suggest that employer and employee have not in fact settled the  terms
     of the employment contract between them.   In  the  circumstances,  we
     have no confidence that the Appellant's expression of  his  intentions
     is to be believed.  We are not satisfied  that  at  the  date  of  the
     decision the Appellant met the requirements  of  sub-paragraphs  (iv),
     (v) or (vi) of paragraph 135I.  His appeal must be dismissed.

 42.  The  fourth  Appellant  was  not  represented  before  us.   We  have
     considered the  papers  with  care.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
     reasons for refusal were only partly based on generalities.  He  noted
     also that the Appellant was unable  to  give  a  credible  reason  for
     wanting to go to the United Kingdom to work.  If it was to develop his
     skills, one would expect him to be able to say what  skills  he  would
     develop;  if it was to earn money, one would expect him  to  know  how
     much money he would earn.  In his determination, the Immigration Judge
     remarked that the refusal was not based solely on suspicion.  He found
     that  the  Appellant  had  not  been  entirely  transparent  with  his
     employer.  We have some sympathy with the grounds of appeal  in  their
     complaint that the  Immigration  Judge  should  not  have  taken  into
     account the fact that the Appellant apparently has  an  uncle  in  the
     United Kingdom;  but in the whole circumstances of the case, that does
     not appear to us to be an error which was  material.   A  considerable
     number of issues were raised by the Entry Clearance Officer,  and  the
     Appellant and his representatives have essentially failed to deal with
     them.  We see no reason to differ from the  Immigration  Judge's  view
     that the Appellant had failed to discharge the burden of  proof;   the
     Immigration Judge made no material error of law.  His decision stands.
      We affirm the Immigration Judge's decision.

Summary

 43. The appeals of AA and MFU are allowed;   those  of  NM  and  MMAC  are
     dismissed.
