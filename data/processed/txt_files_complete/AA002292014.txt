For the Appellant:            Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:     Mr Chaudhry, Lei Dat & Baig Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Ghana date of birth 20th June 1979.  On
    the 23rd March 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Birrell) allowed his
    appeal, with reference to the Immigration Rules[1], against a  decision
    to  remove  him  from  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to  s10  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999[2].  The Secretary  of  State  now  has
    permission to appeal against that decision[3].


 2. This was an unusual case. The Respondent claimed that he  had  suffered
    various forms of serious harm before he came to the UK. His father  had
    been executed by Rawlings when he was a small child, and his mother had
    thereafter killed herself after being raped by revolutionary  soldiers.
    He and his sister had been brought up by an "aunt" who had, along  with
    her husband, subjected both  the  he  and  his  sister  to  sexual  and
    physical abuse, and used them as domestic slaves. The children had been
    eventually  thrown  out  and  had  lived  on  the  streets  where  they
    encountered more abuse by members of the public as  well  as  soldiers.
    When he was about 14-15 the Respondent returned to this "aunt"  begging
    her for help. The woman, Habiba, took the Respondent and his sister  to
    a shrine in the bush where the fetish priest told the  assembled  crowd
    that the children were witches. The priest ordered  4  men  present  to
    kill the Respondent's sister and in the ensuing  melee  the  Respondent
    managed to escape.   He made his way to the C�te D'Ivoire where he  was
    trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation. He fled  there  and
    managed to travel to the UK, spending time in Libya and France  on  the
    way. He claims to have entered the UK in 1998 and to have  slept  rough
    for a number of years before claiming asylum. By the date of the appeal
    before Judge Birrell medical evidence had been obtained indicating that
    he was suffering from serious mental health issues  and  had  attempted
    suicide on a number of occasions.


 3. Judge Birrell did not accept as well founded the  Respondent's  opinion
    that his father had been killed by Rawlings.   She  was  not  satisfied
    that the facts were such that the Refugee Convention  is  engaged.  Nor
    did she find  that  his   removal  would  violate  the  high  threshold
    inherent in Article 3 ECHR. Those findings have  not  been  challenged.
    Having heard the live evidence of the Respondent, and having had regard
    to the numerous medical reports before her, Judge Birrell  was  however
    satisfied that the facts underpinning this claim were true.  She  found
    as fact that he was an orphan who had been brought up by a  couple  who
    subjected him to sexual abuse, that his sister had been killed and that
    he had ended up being sexually abused in the C�te D'Ivoire by a man who
    had initially offered to look after him. She accepted the  unchallenged
    opinion of the  clinicians  who  had  prepared  the  reports  that  the
    Respondent was suffering from mental illnesses including PTSD, and that
    he had made a number of suicide attempts whilst facing  the  threat  of
    removal.  It was accepted that he has been living rough in the UK since
    1998.  On the basis of those findings Judge Birrell was satisfied  that
    the Respondent had discharged the burden of proof in  showing  that  he
    had "no ties" to  Ghana  and  allowed  the  appeal  with  reference  to
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.


 4. The challenge to that decision is that  the  Tribunal  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for accepting some elements of the account proven when
    others had been rejected. It is submitted that there was "no reason  to
    give him the benefit of the doubt" where "core issues" had  been  found
    to be untrue.

    My Findings


 5. Before me Mr Harrison adopted the grounds of appeal and chose  to  make
    no further submissions in support. He was quite right to have done  so.
    These grounds are essentially a disagreement with the facts as found by
    the First-tier Tribunal.


 6. The First-tier Tribunal Judge had the benefit of hearing live  evidence
    from the Respondent. She was able to  weigh  that  testimony,  and  the
    detailed medical evidence, and consider it in the round along with  the
    points set out in the refusal letter, which she  accurately  summarises
    at paragraph 15 of the decision.  It was not an error of  law  for  the
    Judge to have accepted his evidence about his circumstances,  past  and
    present. She was entitled to reject some parts of the evidence,  whilst
    accepting others:   Karanakaran v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2000] 3 All ER 449.  It is simply not true that  the  Judge
    rejected any core elements of the claim   -  it  is  quite  clear  from
    paragraph 29 that the core  factual  issues  were  accepted.  The  only
    negative finding was that Judge Birrell did not accept that as  a  six-
    year-old child the Respondent would  have  known  who  had  killed  his
    father (ie the claim that he had been executed by Rawlings).   Even  if
    that could properly be described as a "core  issue"  the  Tribunal  was
    entitled to make positive findings about other  aspects  of  the  case;
    insofar as the grounds assert the contrary they are wrong in law.   The
    Secretary of State complains that inadequate  reasons  were  given  for
    accepting the Respondent's account. The Judge heard his live  evidence.
    She compared it to  the  written  material  and  the  detailed  account
    provided to his doctors.  She needed to provide no  more  reasons  than
    that which are given: the evidence was consistent and credible. I  find
    that the reasons given were adequate and the Secretary of State  cannot
    be in any doubt about why the appeal was allowed:  the  Judge  believed
    the evidence.


 7. The First-tier Tribunal found that the facts proven led to a conclusion
    that the Respondent has lost all ties with Ghana. There is no challenge
    to that legal analysis and it is one I would respectfully endorse. That
    the Respondent should succeed under paragraph 276ADE(vi) is  even  more
    apparent when the new wording of the rule is considered:  "there  would
    be very significant obstacles to the applicant's integration  into  the
    country to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK".


      Decisions


 8. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law and it
    is upheld.

 9. In view of the distressing facts of this case concerning  sexual  abuse
    and mental health I make a direction as to anonymity in  the  following
    terms:


        "Pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
        Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make  an  anonymity  order.  Unless  the
        Upper Tribunal or Court  directs  otherwise,  no  report  of  these
        proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify the Respondent to
        this appeal. This direction  applies  to  both  the  Appellant  and
        Respondent and a failure to comply with this direction  could  lead
        to Contempt of Court proceedings.
