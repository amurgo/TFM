Representation:
For the Appellant:     The Appellant did not appear and was not represented
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Iraq.  He appealed to  a  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal against the respondent's  decision  of  5  December
    2018 refusing his protection and human rights claim,  subsequent  to  a
    deportation order being made on 6 March 2018.

2.   At the hearing it was  common  ground  that  the  appellant  could  not
    return to Kirkuk and while he would probably have to return to  Baghdad
    initially, if he could not relocate there he could relocate to the IKR.
     There was an expert report from Dr Fatah.

3.   The judge took into account that report and also  country  guidance  in
    AA [2015] UKUT 544 (IAC) and AAH [2018] UKUT 00212 (IAC).

4.   The judge did not find the appellant to be a credible  witness  on  the
    central issue about his family in Iraq and  his  current  knowledge  of
    them.  The judge accepted the evidence in the screenshots  and  biodata
    form that the appellant had family in Iraq in the form of  his  mother,
    father, sister and brother and at the time the note was made he was  in
    contact with them.  The judge did not accept that through social media,
    friends who had assisted him in the past or telephone  calls  he  could
    not provide current information about his family, near and extended, in
    Iraq and abroad.  On the appellant's account he  left  Kirkuk  and  was
    living albeit for a short time in Sulaymaniyah and had relatives there.
     He had not provided an explanation of where they were or that attempts
    had been made to contact them.

5.   The judge rejected the appellant's case that he could  not  go  to  the
    IKR, had no family support, had no CSID, had no access to a CSID or the
    information that would allow him to obtain one.  The judge  found  that
    he has a CSID or would be able to  get  one  issued  to  him  from  his
    family.

6.   The judge noted that it now seemed to be possible to  fly  directly  to
    the IKR.  He considered however that there was no evidence that if  the
    appellant returned through Baghdad he would suffer undue hardship while
    there as he could fly to either of the IKR airports and would have  the
    assistance of his family to do so.  Once at the  IKR  border  he  would
    normally be granted entry to the  territory  and  subject  to  security
    screening and registering presence with a local  mukhtar  he  would  be
    permitted to enter and reside there with no further  legal  impediments
    or requirements.  There was no sponsorship requirement  for  Kurds  and
    his family connections would not cause a risk to him.   Cultural  norms
    would require his family, extended or otherwise, to accommodate him  so
    he would have a relatively normal life which would not be unduly harsh.
     Though he was not from the IKR he had resided there for a time and had
    relatives there, and that region was virtually violence free.   In  any
    event, the judge concluded that  on  the  country  guidance  alone  the
    appellant could obtain entry for ten days and then renew his permission
    for a further ten days and noted that there was no  evidence  that  the
    IKR authorities proactively removed Kurds from the  IKR  whose  permits
    had come to an end.  The appeal was accordingly dismissed.

7.   In the grounds of appeal it was argued that the  judge  had  failed  to
    consider the relevant country guidance  relating  the  ability  of  the
    appellant to obtain a CSID, and failed to consider the country evidence
    regarding the dislocation in Kirkuk, and failed to give reasons for not
    accepting the appellant's evidence  regarding  losing  touch  with  his
    family and had failed to consider  country  guidance  regarding  direct
    return to the KRG.

8.   It was argued that the judge had failed to consider that the  appellant
    was interviewed and gave evidence regarding  contact  with  his  family
    before Kirkuk was attacked by Islamic State and then  retaken  by  Shia
    militias and Iraqi Government troops.  These events gave  rise  to  the
    area being considered as being in a state of internal  armed  conflict.
    It was also contended that the judge had also  erred  in  limiting  his
    consideration of the evidence of Dr Fatah  as  he  had  not  considered
    evidence that approximately 18,000 families had fled Kirkuk in  October
    2017 and hundreds of properties were reported to have been looted,  set
    alight, and destroyed in an apparently targeted attack on predominantly
    Kurdish areas.  The judge failed  to  consider  whether  the  appellant
    would still have available to him the CSID card  following  the  events
    described by Dr Fatah.  It was consistent with the evidence  concerning
    displacement of people in Kirkuk and the appellant had  recently  found
    out that his sister and brother had fled the  area  and  Iraq  are  now
    living in Europe.

9.   It was also argued that even if the  appellant  were  able  to  contact
    family members in Iraq it was inconsistent with  the  country  guidance
    that with their assistance he could obtain a CSID card.   As  had  been
    said in AA, the process at present of obtaining a CSID  from  Iraq  was
    likely to be severely hampered if the person wishing to obtain the CSID
    was from an area where Article 15(c) serious harm was occurring.

10.  It was also argued that the judge erred in not referring  to  the  fact
    that the family was from a contested area  and  there  was  the  expert
    evidence regarding massive displacement of people from  the  area  when
    not accepting his account of losing touch with his family.  It was also
    an error to conclude that it might be impossible for the  appellant  to
    return directly to the KRG as it was accepted by the respondent in  AAH
    that all returns to Iraq were via Baghdad.

11.  Permission to appeal was granted on all grounds.

12.  The matter was listed for 20 May 2019.  In the  afternoon  of  17  May,
    i.e. the previous Friday, the appellant's  representatives  emailed  to
    seek an adjournment of the hearing as due to  an  administrative  error
    they had not realised the appeal was due to take place  on  the  Monday
    and Counsel had not been instructed.  Nor had a bundle  been  prepared.
    The adjournment application was put before the President,  who  refused
    it on the basis that it was an error  of  law  hearing  and  the  Upper
    Tribunal and the Home Office almost  certainly  had  all  the  material
    already upon which the appellant was likely to need to reply,  and  the
    representatives could prepare a bundle to bring to the hearing if  they
    saw fit.

13.  There was no renewal of the adjournment application,  it  simply  being
    indicated by the appellant's representative  that  they  would  not  be
    attending following the refusal of the adjournment request.

14.  In his submissions Mr Lindsay relied on the Rule 24 response  that  had
    been put in and argued that it was  clear  from  paragraph  47  of  the
    judge's decision that he had taken into account the expert report.  The
    determination was properly reasoned.  He made it clear at paragraph  52
    why he considered that the appellant was in contact  with  his  family.
    It could not be disputed that there were direct flights now between the
    UK and Kirkuk.  There was also evidence that Kirkuk was not a  disputed
    territory.  As could be seen from the Rule 24 response, in the case  of
    Amin [2017] EWHC 2417 the Secretary of State was entitled to  take  the
    realities on the ground  into  account  and  Kirkuk  was  no  longer  a
    contested area.  Kirkuk had been under the  control/protection  of  the
    Iraqi Government  forces  since  September  2017  when  Kurdish  forces
    withdrew following a failed referendum and they sought to bring  Kirkuk
    into the KRG.  In light of this position Sir  Ross  Cranston  concluded
    that he could not regard the  passages  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    letter as regards the claimant's ability to obtain a CSID in that  case
    as being flawed.  Country  guidance  cases  must  give  weight  to  the
    realities, as had been recognised in SG (Iraq) [2012] EWCA Civ  940  at
    paragraph 47.  The situation in the area of Kirkuk  had  not  for  some
    time come anywhere near reaching the Article 15(c)  threshold,  it  was
    argued.  The appellant could make use of a family member to get a  CSID
    and the judge had found that he had family members in the area even  if
    he could not fly directly to Kirkuk.

15.  With regard to the expert, his credentials were  not  in  dispute,  but
    his evidence had been considered and referred to, and clear reasons had
    been  given  for  the  findings.   As  regards  the  specific  evidence
    mentioned at paragraph 9 of the grounds, the  judge  did  not  have  to
    refer to every individual  item  of  evidence  but  had  to  give  full
    consideration to the main points so the parties would know why they had
    won and lost.  The key point was that the appellant would be  returning
    to an area where there was no real  risk  of  indiscriminate  violence.
    Also the evidence from Dr Fatah had to be considered in the real world.
     The population of Kirkuk in 1997 was over � million  people  and  that
    had to be contrasted to his evidence about the hundreds  of  properties
    looted and about 18,000 families fleeing and it did not  also  say  how
    many had returned to their homes as, if  hundreds  of  properties  were
    looted and destroyed, a lot would have been left standing.  There was a
    proper factual basis for the appeal taken by the judge.  The judge  was
    entitled to conclude as he did.   The  points  raised  in  the  grounds
    relied to an extent on Kirkuk being a contested area, but that had  not
    been so for some time and hence the judge was entitled to  conclude  as
    he did.

16.  I reserved my determination.

17.  The judge set  out  clear  reasons  for  disbelieving  the  appellant's
    evidence.  These are summarised at paragraph 50 of  the  decision.   It
    was open to the judge to find that it  had  not  been  shown  that  the
    appellant did not have family members whom  he  could  contact  in  the
    local area in order to obtain a CSID.  In light of what was said by Sir
    Ross Cranston in Amin it was properly open to  the  judge  to  conclude
    that in light of his  views  on  the  credibility  of  the  appellant's
    evidence it was not a matter of trying to obtain a  CSID  for  an  area
    where Article 15(c) serious harm was occurring as set out at  paragraph
    171 of AA, quoted at paragraph 14 of the grounds, the point  also  made
    at paragraph 8 of the grounds.  The judge stated that he had considered
    Dr Fatah's evidence, and his conclusions can properly be  seen  in  the
    light of Mr Lindsay's argument concerning the relative numbers, in  the
    size of Kirkuk, the quotation that on Dr Fatah's evidence that hundreds
    of  properties  had  been  looted,  set  alight   and   destroyed   and
    approximately 18,000 families had fled.   The  report,  as  Mr  Lindsay
    noted, says nothing about the numbers of families that had returned  or
    might return in light of the fact that Kirkuk was no longer a contested
    area.  The judge's  evidence  is  properly  rooted  in  the  background
    evidence and it was open to him to find that  the  appellant  would  be
    able to get a CSID issued to him via his family.  Whether return  could
    be as seems to be the case now by direct  flight  to  the  IKR  or  via
    Baghdad, the judge's findings were in the alternative at paragraph  56,
    and the further points made at paragraph 57 and 58 are also in my  view
    sound.  It was open to him to find that in the particular circumstances
    of the case this was an appellant who would be able to obtain a CSID on
    return  to  an  area  where  there  was  no  longer  a  real  risk   of
    indiscriminate violence resulting from  internal  armed  conflict,  and
    accordingly I consider that his decision dismissing this appeal has not
    been showing to be legally flawed in any respect.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
