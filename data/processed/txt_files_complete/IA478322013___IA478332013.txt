Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Pierre Sibomana, Sponsor
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are citizens of Tanzania born respectively on 25th April
    2004 and 1st May 2006.  On 25th May 2013  they  applied  for  residence
    cards as a confirmation of a right to reside  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Their applications were refused by  the  Secretary  of  State  on  20th
    October 2013.  The basis of their applications were that  in  order  to
    qualify for residence it was necessary for them to  provide  sufficient
    evidence to demonstrate that their EEA  family  member  was  exercising
    free movement rights in the United Kingdom as defined under  Regulation
    6 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 and that Regulation 6(2)(b)
    stipulated that a person who claimed to be a qualified  person  in  the
    United Kingdom as a jobseeker must:

      i) have registered as a jobseeker and was employed for at least a year
         before becoming unemployed;

     ii) had been unemployed for no more than six months, or

    iii) can provide evidence that they are seeking employment in the UK and
         have a genuine chance of being engaged.

 2. The refusal referred to the  employment  of  their  father,  Mr  Pierre
    Kassanda.  The Appellants appealed against the decision and the  appeal
    was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Mailer sitting  at  Richmond  on
    29th September 2014.  In a determination promulgated  on  14th  October
    2014 the Appellants' appeal was allowed.

 3. On 17th October 2014 the Secretary of State lodged Grounds of Appeal to
    the Upper Tribunal.  The Grounds of Appeal stipulated that  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  had  materially  erred  in  law  in  that  in  applying
    Regulation 6 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006  the  judge  had
    failed to apply the Immigration (EEA) (Amendment) (No.  2)  Regulations
    2013 which came into effect on 1st January 2014  and  7th  April  2014.
    Applying  Regulation  6(2)  it  was  submitted  that  under   the   new
    Regulations a Sponsor had to show that he could provide  evidence  that
    he was seeking employment and had a genuine  chance  of  being  engaged
    other  than  satisfying  one  or  other  of  those  conditions  in  the
    alternative as was set out in the original Regulation 6.

 4.  On  26th  February  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Saffer  granted
    permission to appeal.  In granting permission  the  judge  acknowledged
    that the wrong Regulation may well have been applied as the test by the
    First-tier Tribunal but also that the Secretary of State had  erred  in
    conceding that the Regulation was met and  that  a  Tribunal  had  wide
    discretion to permit a concession made to be  withdrawn  if  there  was
    good reason in all the circumstances to do so.

 5. It was on that basis the appeal came before me to determine whether  or
    not there was a material error of law in the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal on 10th April  2015.   The  Appellants  were  not  represented
    appearing by their Sponsor and father Mr Sibomana.   The  Secretary  of
    State appeared at that hearing by her Home Office Presenting Officer Mr
    Wilding.

 6. I made findings and gave directions at  that  initial  hearing  to  the
    effect  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  (albeit   I   am   sure
    inadvertently)  had  failed  to  apply  the  amendments  to   the   EEA
    Regulations and that the judge was undoubtedly influenced  in  this  by
    the concession made by the Secretary of State who clearly at that  time
    also failed to acknowledge that the  new  Regulations  were  in  place.
    There was however a completely different criteria that is applied  when
    by substituting the word "or" with the word "and" in that both limbs of
    Regulation 6(2) were now required to be  met.   In  such  circumstances
    considering the discretion available to the Tribunal I found there  was
    a material error of law and set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge.

 7. At that hearing I intimated this to Mr Sibomana and indicated  that  it
    would be necessary for him to show that  he  was  actively  engaged  in
    employment.   His  current  work  as  a  cleaner  would  satisfy   that
    requirement but as he had only recently obtained employment he  had  no
    documentation in order to support his  claim.   In  such  circumstances
    rather than remaking the decision one way or the other I adjourned  the
    matter and set  out  directions.   It  was  agreed  that  within  those
    directions I would evidence  documentation  which  the  Sponsor  should
    consider producing to the court in support of his  contention  that  he
    now met the Regulations.

 8. The Sponsor has filed a small additional bundle of documents consisting
    of wage slips dated 31st March 2015 and 30th April 2015 both  of  which
    show that he is in employment with J & K Kleen Limited and that he  has
    a monthly earnings of �514.50 and �494.00 for each  respective  recited
    month.  In addition he has produced a letter from his  employers  dated
    1st May 2015 confirming he has been in their employ as a cleaner  since
    1st March 2015 working sixteen hours per week.

 9. Mr Jarvis intimates that whilst that evidence is quite satisfactory the
    Secretary of State does need to be satisfied that  that  employment  is
    continuing.  The Sponsor gave verbal evidence to the  effect  that  his
    employment had commenced on 1st March  2015,  that  he  worked  sixteen
    hours per week earning �7 per hour and that he was still in employment.
     He confirmed that his income is paid by his employers  into  his  bank
    account and he produced documentary evidence confirming that  this  had
    taken place.

10. In such circumstances Mr Jarvis conceded that  there  was  no  evidence
    before the Tribunal to dispute the  suggestion  that  the  Sponsor  was
    currently working and  that  the  Secretary  of  State  would  in  such
    circumstances not contest the matter further.

Findings

11. This matter was adjourned because the Sponsor (and father) only  needed
    to show that he was working and in continuing employment  in  order  to
    demonstrate that he was exercising free movement rights in  the  United
    Kingdom  as  defined  under  Regulation  6  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  It was not necessary for him to show that he  was  a
    jobseeker if he was actually in employment.  The fact that  he  was  no
    longer a jobseeker was not a matter to which the Secretary of State had
    previously been aware prior to the hearing to determine  whether  there
    was a material error of law.  However on the evidence being produced by
    the Sponsor Mr Jarvis on behalf of the Secretary of State confirms that
    he is satisfied that the Sponsor is in employment  and  on  such  basis
    meets the Regulations.  I agree with that analysis.

Notice of Decision

With it  being  shown  that  the  Sponsor  meets  the  requirements  of  the
Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  the  Appellants'   applications   for
residence cards as confirmation of  a  right  of  residence  as  the  family
members of an EEA national are allowed.

No anonymity order is made.
