Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Saeed, Counsel, instructed by Aman Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is referred as the  Secretary  of  State
    and the Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national of Afghanistan, date of birth 1 January  1994,
    appealed against the Secretary of State's decision, dated  4  September
    2014, to refuse to vary leave to remain and to make removal  directions
    under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

3.   The appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Callender-Smith (the judge) who, on 3 March 2015,  allowed  the  appeal
    under the Refugee Convention  and  Articles  2  and  3  and  separately
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

4.   Permission to appeal that decision was given to the Secretary of  State
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge V A Osborne on 18 March 2015.

5.   At the hearing on 3 August 2015 Mr Walker on behalf  of  the  Secretary
    of State applied to amend the grounds of appeal in order  to  raise  an
    error of law and fact in that the judge accepted that  the  Appellant's
    claim that he did not have an Afghan passport and that were he to apply
    for one he would face the real  risk  of  ill-treatment  on  return  to
    Afghanistan. Yet as a fact the Appellant did have  a  current  passport
    (0A436032 issued in London 08/02/2011 valid to 2016) (AB page B19).  Mr
    Saeed opposed the application on the basis that the application was too
    late and ultimately made no difference to the  outcome.  I  decided  to
    allow the amendment to the grounds because the Appellant's  credibility
    was at the heart of the judge's assessment of risk and events on return
    to Afghanistan. Mr Walker also argued that the  credibility  issue  and
    assessment affected the judge's findings on Article 8  ECHR  issues.  I
    decided to permit the amendment on the basis that  it  arose  from  the
    judge's findings and the person drafting the grounds reliant  upon  the
    Decision alone would not have appreciated the  fact the Appellant had a
    current Afghan passport.

6.   The fact that the Appellant had a new afghan passport was  not  brought
    to  the  judge's  attention  by  the  Appellant's  representative.  The
    omission was not picked  up  by  the  judge  who  had  "also  read  the
    Appellant's  bundle"  (Decision  paragraph  19)  and  "...   read   and
    considered all the papers before me ..." (Decision  paragraph  20):  It
    does not seem he could have done so.

7.   Rather the judge proceeded on the  basis  of  the  Appellant's  written
    (Statement dated  3  Novmber  2014  paragraph23  ABpage  B5)  and  oral
    evidence (Decision paragraph  21(d)),  as  reported  in  the  decision,
    finding that the Appellant did not have an  Afghan  passport  (Decision
    paragraph 21(d) and paragraph 28(c) and (e)). At the hearing on the  18
    February 2015 the judge's record of proceedings  showed  the  Appellant
    adopted his witness statement without correction  and  told  the  judge
    that he did not have a passport or visa when  he  attended  the  Harrow
    Registry Office on 30 January  2015.  Yet  the  Appellant  had  already
    obtained his passport and an Immigration status document providing  DLR
    on 25 November 2010 which may have been extended if the Appellant  was,
    as the judge found, lawfully in the UK (Decision paragraph 28 (q)).

8.   Thus the judge accepted the Refugee Convention claim and  Articles  2&3
    ECHR claims because to obtain  evidence  of  his  nationality  (NIC  or
    passport) e.g. reveal information about himself, his  place  of  birth,
    details of his parents and possibly uncles and grandfather but that  he
    did not  know  such  information.  In  those  circumstances  the  judge
    accepted Afghan officials would doubt the Appellant's identity and on a
    return to Afghanistan arrest him for being a suspected supporter of the
    Taliban or the Appellant '... may become the target of fatal  attention
    by the Taliban' (Decision paragraph 28(e)).

9.   The passport contained the Appellant's  date  of  birth  as  1  January
    1994, his place of birth Kundoz in Afghanistan. Kundoz province as  the
    home area was identified in both the  Appellant's  statement  (B  page1
    paragraph1) and personal statement (B page 4  paragraph4).  I  have  no
    reason to doubt, the passport  photograph  was  of  the  Appellant.   A
    similar picture of the  Appellant  appeared  in  his  Residence  Permit
    issued in 2010 and valid  to  July  2011.   An  application  to  extend
    Discretionary Leave to Remain was made on 27  June  2011  but  was  not
    refused until the Secretary of State's decision  of  4  September  2014
    (RFRL paragraphs 12, 17 & 76).

10.  It simply could not be argued that if the Appellant managed  to  obtain
    an Afghan passport in 2011 that he  could  not  provide  the  necessary
    particulars to obtain a valid passport.  There was nothing to  indicate
    that the value attributed to a passport issued by the Afghan government
    is anything less than that by other states  and  the  importance  of  a
    passport as evidence of identity can not be under-estimated.

11.  In these circumstances I have considered whether  or  not  the  judge's
    omission to address the  evidence,  might  give  rise  to  a  different
    outcome  in  considering  the  merits  of  the  appeal,  not  only  the
    assessment of risk under the Refugee Convention of the Appellant  being
    persecuted but also, in relation to proscribed  ill-treatment  contrary
    to Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR.

12.  Having considered that matter in the light of  the  case  of  R  (Iran)
    [2005] EWCA Civ 982 it seemed to me that there was a material  omission
    which could well lead to a different outcome in the appeal in terms  of
    the assessment of risk on return.  It is clear that other  findings  of
    fact were driven by the judge's conclusion that he found the  Appellant
    a cogent and credible witness for the judge was struck by the Appellant
    as "an unusually straightforward and honourable young man".

13.  The assessment may in other resects be correct, for I express  no  view
    upon it, but it seemed to me that the  assessment  of  credibility  was
    likely to be affected by the passport error.  Whilst it cannot be  said
    with certainty that the different result would arise, it certainly  was
    the case that the judge made  that  assessment  skewed  by  a  lack  of
    consideration of the relevant evidence and as such  made  an  error  of
    fact and an error of law.I conclude the judge's findings on the Refugee
    Convention and Article 2&3 ECHR claims  disclose  errors  of  law.  The
    Original Tribunal decisions can not stand.

14.  The judge did not  consider  the  Secretary  of  State's  decisions  on
    Appendix FM nor Paragraph 276ADE of the immigration  rules.The  judge's
    explanation of the outcome of the  Article  8  claim  was,  to  put  it
    mildly, so terse as to be inadequate.  Whilst finding  the  Appellant's
    family life rights under Article 8 were engaged he gives no reasons. He
    did not address  the  Appellant's  private  life  rights.  The  Judge's
    consideration of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and Huang [2007] UKHL  11  lacks
    reasons. How the Appellant with a fianc�e of c. 2 � years, with whom he
    does not live, enjoy family life was not explained by  the  judge.  The
    Appellant's fianc�e Ms Naqshbandi statement gave  no  material  insight
    into their family life nor does the judge's decision  (paragraphs22-25,
    28 (f)-(j)).  Quite simply there  were  no  adequate  reasons  for  the
    Article 8 finding nor any balanced assessment of  proportionality.  The
    judge treats Section117B NIAA 2002 as if it is a criteria  approach  to
    assessing proportionality.

15.  I am satisfied that there has been an error of law in relation  Article
    8 ECHR assessment not least with reference to the  credibility  of  the
    Appellant and  the public interest.

NOTICE OF DECISION

16.  Accordingly I  am  satisfied  that  the  Original  Tribunal's  decision
    cannot stand and the decision will have  to  be  remade.  No  anonymity
    order was sought.
