                                     and

               The secretary of State for the Home department
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are the decision and reasons given without a hearing, pursuant to
    rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008.     The
    context of doing so is set out in the background below.

Background

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Hanbury, promulgated on 12th November 2019, by which the FtT  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision  of  24th  May
    2019 to refuse to issue the appellant with a residence card  under  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016, as the former family member  of  an
    EEA national exercising treaty rights in the UK, who claims to  have  a
    retained right of residence.  The FtT found that marriage  between  the
    appellant and his estranged wife was a marriage of convenience, entered
    into solely for the purpose of facilitating  the  appellant's  enhanced
    immigration status in the UK under the  Regulations  (see  �22  of  the
    FtT's decision).  The FtT  reached  that  conclusion,  noting  evidence
    about visits to the couple's claimed address, where it  was  said  that
    the appellant was absent (��11 and 18);  the  lack  of  other  evidence
    about the claimed relationship such  as  mobile  phone  photographs  or
    texts to one another (�19);   discrepancies  in  the  couple's  account
    (�20); lack of contact between the couple's respective  families;  lack
    of visits; and lack of evidence of cohabitation (�21).

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal which include that the  FtT  had
    failed to consider that the appellant had met  the  sponsor's  parents;
    there was evidence of cohabitation; and the  FtT  had  failed  to  make
    findings in relation to the witness statement of a friend, said  to  be
    in support of the genuineness of the marriage.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Foudy refused permission to  appeal  on  1st
    May 2020, but on renewed  permission,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Mandalia
    granted permission on all grounds in a decision dated  29th  May  2020,
    regarding it as arguable that the FtT had erred in failing to  consider
    the witness statement of the friend, and the evidence of  cohabitation.
    In the context of Covid-19, he reached the preliminary view that it was
    appropriate to decide whether the FtT had erred in law, on the  papers,
    without the need for a hearing and issued  directions  asking  for  the
    parties' views.  Upper Tribunal Judge Coker issued  further  directions
    on 11th September 2020.  It is unclear from  the  appellant's  response
    dated 25th September 2020 whether he objected to the issue  of  whether
    the FtT erred in law being decided on the papers, but in any event,  in
    her Rule 24 response dated 30th  September  2020,  the  respondent  has
    conceded that the FtT erred in law materially and the respondent had no
    objection to remaking being  remitted  without  preserved  findings  of
    fact. The respondent made clear that she continued to assert  that  the
    marriage was one of convenience and added that the  sponsor's  exercise
    of treaty rights was in dispute.

 5. I have  considered again the present need to take  precautions  against
    the spread of Covid-19;  the  overriding  objective  expressed  in  the
    Procedure Rules; the Pilot  Practice  Direction  (PPD)  issued  by  the
    Senior President of Tribunals on 19th March 2020; and the High  Court's
    decision in Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants v The President
    of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) [2020] EWHC 3103
    (Admin) (particularly the conclusion at paragraph 8.1).  I regard it as
    appropriate to decide on the papers, without the need  for  a  hearing,
    whether the FtT erred in law, such that  his  decision  should  be  set
    aside without preserved findings of fact, as the  respondent  expressly
    concedes this in her Rule 24 response, and that is a concession  which,
    for reasons I set out below, is rightly made. In the  circumstances,  a
    hearing  to  decide  whether  there  has  been  an  error  of  law   is
    unnecessary, disproportionate and not in accordance with the overriding
    objective.





Discussion and conclusions

 6. Central to this case is  the  couple's  credibility.   Where  there  is
    potentially  corroborative  evidence  of  that  credibility,  that   is
    relevant to the issue in dispute and it  is  incumbent  on  an  FtT  to
    assess that evidence  and  explain  the  weight  it  attaches  to  that
    evidence and if it is disbelieved or regarded as not accurate, why that
    is the case.  In this case, the FtT referred explicitly to the  witness
    statement of a witness, Ms Sneeha Day,  at  �7  of  his  decision,  but
    failed to make any reference to, or analyse, her evidence further.  The
    respondent accepts  in  the  Rule  24  response  that  the  credibility
    assessment was materially undermined as a result, a concession which  I
    regard as realistic. While  the  FtT's  decision  was  otherwise  well-
    structured and explained, that flaw  undermines  the  entirety  of  the
    assessment (as credibility  must  be  assessed  in  light  of  all  the
    evidence), so none of the findings are safe.

Decision on error of law

 7. In my view there are material errors here and  I  must  set  the  FtT's
    decision aside, without preserved findings of fact.

Disposal

 8. With reference to paragraph 7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statement and the  necessary  fact-finding,  (there  are  no  preserved
    findings, and the assessment of the  appellant's  credibility  must  be
    made afresh), this is clearly a case that has to  be  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a complete rehearing.

 9. The remittal shall involve a complete  rehearing  of  the  appeal.  All
    aspects of the claims must be addressed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside.

I remit this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a complete rehearing.

Directions to the First-tier Tribunal

This appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a complete  rehearing
with no preserved findings of fact.

The remitted  appeal  shall  not  be  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
Hanbury.

No anonymity direction is made.
