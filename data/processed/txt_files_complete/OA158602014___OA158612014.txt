Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Kannangara, Counsel instructed by Anglo Chinese
                    Law Firm Ltd
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are nationals of China who were born on 11 October  1971
    and 2 November 1996 respectively. The first  Appellant  is  the  second
    Appellant's mother and they both  applied  for  entry  clearance  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules to join their  spouse  and  father
    respectively. Both applications were refused  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer (ECO) on 17 November 2011  on  the  grounds  that  he  was  not
    satisfied that the relationship was  as  claimed,  that  the  financial
    requirements had been demonstrated by the required  specified  evidence
    or that the first Appellant had provided proof that she had  passed  an
    English language test with an approved  provider.  The  decisions  were
    reviewed and maintained by an  Entry  Clearance  Manager  (ECM)  on  25
    February 2015. The Respondent accepted that the  second  Appellant  was
    the sponsor's daughter as claimed but did not  accept  that  the  first
    Appellant and sponsor were married and concluded that the financial and
    English language requirements were not met.

 2. The Appellants appealed the  decision  under  section  82  (1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  (the  2002  Act).  Their
    appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Young in  a  decision
    promulgated on 25 November 2015. The Appellants  sought  permission  to
    appeal against that decision on  15  December  2015.  The  grounds  for
    seeking permission were that the First-tier Tribunal failed to make any
    findings on whether documents sent by the Appellants to  the  ECO  were
    received before the  decision.  The  Appellants  also  argue  that  the
    Appellants satisfied the financial requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE  on
    the date of the refusal decision. They also contend that the First-tier
    Tribunal erred in concluding that the documents were not before the ECO
    when the decision was made. It is further argued  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal could have considered the financial documents at  the  hearing
    as these were before the ECO or the ECM. It is said that the ECM  could
    also have considered the documents. It is also contended that the First-
    tier Tribunal made an error regarding the burden of proof  as  the  ECO
    had returned the supporting documents to the Appellants in January 2015
    and the ECO was obliged to give reasons  why  the  documents  were  not
    considered in their refusal decision or the review.

 3. Permission to appeal  was  granted  on  13  March  2016  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Kelly on the grounds that as this  was  not  a  "points-
    based" appeal to which section 85A(4) of the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum  Act  2002  applied;  it  was  arguable  that  the  Tribunal
    materially erred in law in determining the appeal by reference  to  the
    question of whether the ECO had been in  possession  of  the  requisite
    "specified documents" under Appendix FM-SE rather  than  asking  itself
    whether the documents that were before it at the hearing of the  appeal
    sufficed to meet the relevant requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The grant puts the Appellants on notice that even  if  their  arguments
    are accepted, they are only likely to succeed if they can show that the
    documents that were before the First-tier Tribunal met  the  "specified
    evidence" requirements of Appendix  FM-SE,  and  only  subject  to  the
    exercise of discretion conferred by paragraph D thereof.

    The Hearing

 4. At the hearing Mr Kannangara said that the only  issue  in  the  appeal
    related to the specified  evidence.  The  sponsor  had  explained  what
    happened and there was a delay getting the specified documents  to  the
    Respondent. They managed to submit the documents whilst the appeal  was
    under consideration. The decision was made to refuse in  November  2014
    and it was said in the decision that the  specified  evidence  was  not
    there. The documents were returned to the Appellants  in  January  2015
    and that is why they were in the Appellant's bundle.  In  paragraph  53
    the First-tier Tribunal relied on the case  of  DR  ECO:  post-decision
    evidence) Morocco * [2005]  UKIAT  00038)  and  did  not  accept  these
    documents. The ECO had the opportunity to see the  documents  and  that
    was the objective of the review. The ECM noted the English  certificate
    was there and this was not submitted with the application. It was not a
    points-based system case and during the period the  required  specified
    evidence was available and unfortunately it was not considered. All  of
    the specified documents were available.

 5. Ms Isherwood submitted that there was no  material  error.  It  was  an
    evidenced based issue. The Appellants' case  was  that  everything  was
    before the ECM. However the ECM  review  stated  which  documents  were
    submitted with the  application  and  which  were  submitted  with  the
    review. There were no further financial documents provided. She took me
    through the appeal bundle which showed that the  Appellants  sought  to
    rely on evidence dated after date of decision. In  Appendix  FM-SE  the
    documents  to  be  submitted  which  would  be  considered   with   the
    application were set out at (D) and (e) related to the exercise of  the
    discretion. The specified evidence was not in the appeal bundle and had
    not been provided to the First-tier Tribunal. At  paragraph  4  of  the
    witness statement of sponsor there was  reference  to  lost  documents.
    There was no evidence in support and it was just an assertion and  that
    is what the Judge considered. The First-tier Tribunal's decision stated
    at paragraph 47 that documents were not considered at the date  of  the
    application. There was no postal receipt  for  11  November  2014  that
    issue had been resolved against the Appellant. In relation to  Appendix
    FM-SE there was no  evidence  satisfying  the  financial  requirements.
    There were no bank statements showing the sponsor's income at the  date
    of entry clearance decision. The evidence must be dated no earlier than
    28 days before the application and it applied to payslips for a  period
    of 6 months prior to the application. That evidence was not provided in
    the appeal bundle.  The bank statements were from page 80 and they  did
    not correspond with any payslips provided and page 83 showed  that  one
    payment was made prior to the decision. Bank statements  from  February
    to May 2015 were relied on. She referred to paragraphs 57 and 58 of  SS
    (Congo) v  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  where  the  Court  found  that
    applicants should put in a fresh application rather than rely on  post-
    decision evidence. The evidence presented was dated after the  date  of
    the decision. At paragraph 59 the First-tier  Tribunal  noted  the  ECO
    report. The Judge was clearly taking account of what the Appellant  and
    Respondent's position was. The Judge acknowledged that  the  obligation
    was on the Appellants to provide the evidence and not the fault of  the
    Respondent. There was no record of financial documents being available.
    They were not available and the appeal bundle sought to rely  on  post-
    decision evidence.

 6. Mr Kannangara submitted that the required documents were  available  to
    the ECO and it was clear that they were not taken into account. He  did
    not dispute that they were not listed by the ECO and accepted that they
    were not provided with the application  but  the  relevant  period  for
    assessment was the date of the application  and  these  documents  were
    relevant to the period question. The sponsor was earning  the  required
    amount and that had not changed. The P60 related to his job started job
    in April 2015 and that was the correct P60.  The  documents  were  sent
    and two responsible officers did not take them into  account  and  they
    were sent back after an email.  Paragraph 53 of the decision  contained
    a material error of law and the decision should be set aside.

    Discussion and Findings

 7. The first issue to be determined is  what  evidence  the  Tribunal  was
    entitled to take into account in this appeal. The  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge directed himself at paragraph 53 that  he  could  not  take  into
    account evidence that was not available at the date of the Respondent's
    decision. He then concluded at paragraph 54 of the decision that  there
    was no evidence that the financial evidence was posted to the ECO on 11
    November 2014 as was claimed by the Appellants. He took into account  a
    letter from Parcel Force at page 191 of the  Appellant's  bundle  which
    indicated that the parcel  originally  sent  from  China  was  held  by
    customs but noted that there was no  subsequent  postal  receipt  which
    would show that the documents were sent at that  time  to  Beijing.  He
    found that he could not conclude that the ECO or ECM  had  before  them
    documents that would satisfy the financial requirements.

 8. The Appellants' principal submission is that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    erred at paragraph 53 to 55 of  its  determination  in  expressing  the
    issue in the appeal as one of admissibility of evidence. It  is  argued
    that the financial documents submitted were admissible  because  either
    they were available to the ECO at the date of the decision,  review  or
    evidence submitted post-decision was not to  be  excluded  if  it  shed
    light on the circumstances appertaining at the time of the Respondent's
    decision (section 85A(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 - see also DR (ECO: post-decision evidence) Morocco * [2005] UKIAT
    00038). It is in effect argued that  the  documents  available  at  the
    hearing were demonstrative of the  circumstances  appertaining  at  the
    date of the Respondent's decision and showed, in the prescribed manner,
    the financial circumstances of the sponsor to meet the requirements  of
    Appendix FM.

 9. In order to succeed in  their  applications  for  entry  clearance  the
    Appellants had to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules at the
    date  of  the  Respondent's  decision.  In  respect  of  the  financial
    requirements they were required: (a) to demonstrate the sponsor  had  a
    level of income in accordance with that specified  under  paragraph  E-
    ECP.3.1 of Appendix FM; (b) to demonstrate that  the  income  was  from
    specified sources (E-ECP 3.2); and (c) to establish (a) and (b) by  the
    production of specified evidence pursuant to Appendix FM-SE.

10. I have been referred to no authority which decides whether, in relation
    to an application where specified evidence is required  under  Appendix
    FM-SE, an appellant can succeed in his/her appeal by producing evidence
    at the hearing of the appeal which meets the requirements for specified
    evidence that was in existence at the date of the Respondent's decision
    but was not before the decision-maker.  Paragraph D of  Appendix  FM-SE
    states that in  deciding  an  application  in  relation  to  which  the
    Appendix states that specified evidence must be provided,  the  ECO  or
    Secretary of State ("the decision-maker") will consider documents  that
    have been submitted  with  the  application,  and  will  only  consider
    documents submitted after the application where  sub-paragraph  (b)  or
    (e) applies.  That restriction on the  consideration  of  documentation
    does not apply to the Tribunal.

11.  The  Tribunal  is  constrained  to  consideration   of   circumstances
    appertaining at the date of the Respondent's decision (section 85  A(2)
    of the 2002 Act). The provisions of the Immigration Act  2014  did  not
    apply to this appeal.  On the one had it could  be  argued  that  those
    circumstances include where an appellant  has  failed  to  produce  the
    specified evidence and that the availability of such  evidence  at  the
    date of the hearing does not alter the  circumstances  appertaining  at
    the date of the Respondent's decision. It could be argued that the post-
    decision production of the omitted evidence cannot alter the fact  that
    at the date  of  the  decision  an  appellant  could  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of the rules because he or she had not complied with those
    requirements in respect of specified evidence.

12. On the other hand it  could  be  argued  that  the  circumstances  that
    appertained at the  date  of  the  decision  were  that  the  specified
    evidence proving the required income was in existence  and  albeit  not
    before the Entry Clearance officer could be taken into account.

13. I conclude that the later construction  is  correct.  Parliament  could
    have, and chose not to, enact a provision in relation  to  applications
    under Appendix FM and FM-SE where only evidence submitted in support of
    and at the time of making the  application  to  which  the  immigration
    decision relates (save for certain exceptions)  could  be  admitted  on
    appeal such as the provision in relation  to  Points-based  appeals.  I
    therefore conclude that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in failing
    to take account of evidence that was in existence at the  date  of  the
    Respondent's decision and that was before it on appeal but  not  before
    the ECO.

14. However, that error was immaterial because it  is  clear  that  on  the
    evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  Appellants  could  not
    satisfy  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   It  was  the
    Appellants' case that the sponsor was in salaried employment in the  UK
    and in the circumstances by virtue of paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE  he
    was required to produce (a) payslips covering  a  period  of  6  months
    prior to the date of the application; (b) a letter  from  the  employer
    who issued the  salary  confirming  the  employment  and  gross  annual
    salary, the length of the employment, the period over which the  salary
    was paid and the type of employment; and (c) personal  bank  statements
    corresponding to the same period(s) as the payslips  showing  that  the
    salary had been paid into their account. By virtue of paragraph  1  (l)
    that evidence or the most recently dated part of it had to be dated  no
    later than 28 days before the date of the application.

15. The Appellant's bundle contains payslips from pages 77 to 79. The dates
    on those payslips are April to December 2014. The application was  made
    in October 2014 and hence the payslips covered  the  six  month  period
    prior to the application. The bank statements are from pages 80 to  89.
    The personal bank statements are dated from 27 August 2014 to 27 August
    2015. There is also a document headed "annual summary  information"  at
    pages 80 and 81 showing entries from 25  March  2014  to  29  September
    2014. There is no payment from the sponsor's  employer  Super  Del  Ltd
    until 10 October 2014 when he was paid  �4,240.36.  This  is  the  only
    payment pre-dating the application. The  Appellant  produced  a  letter
    from the sponsor's employer at page 72 of the bundle stating  that  his
    employment commenced in April 2014 but that the company was financially
    unstable and hence the sponsor was paid what he was  owed  in  October.
    However, his payslips show that he earned  �1,651.83  a  month  and  by
    October he was owed �9,909.78 and hence it cannot be argued  that  bank
    statements corresponding to the payslips show the salary was paid  into
    his account. In the circumstances on the evidence before the First-tier
    Tribunal the Appellants could not have met the  financial  requirements
    of paragraph FM-SE and therefore the error of law was not material.

    Conclusions:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of a material error on a point of law. I do  not  set  aside
    the decision.

There is no direction for anonymity none having been  made  and  none  being
appropriate on the facts.
