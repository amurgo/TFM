For the Respondent:    Mr S Nwaekwu, Moorehouse Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   Although this appeal is brought by the Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department we shall refer to the parties as in the First-tier Tribunal.
     The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on  14th  July  1983.   His
    appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse indefinite leave  to
    remain as the spouse of a British citizen, Tyra Kelly Denise Rolle, the
    Sponsor, was allowed under the Immigration Rules by First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Cohen on 1st December 2014.

2.   The Appellant came to the UK on 7th September 2008 as  a  student  with
    leave until 30th June 2011.  On 27th  June  he  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as the spouse of a person settled in the UK.  The Appellant  was
    granted leave to remain from 29th July 2011 until 29th July  2013.   On
    29th June  2013  he  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  under
    paragraph 287 of the Immigration  Rules.   This  was  refused  on  31st
    October 2013 on the basis that the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  had  given
    inconsistent  accounts  in  interview  in  relation  to   the   tenancy
    agreement, when they met, what they did at the weekend, the name of the
    Sponsor's father and the Sponsor's immediate  family.   The  Respondent
    was not satisfied that the Appellant and the Sponsor were in a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship.

3.   At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  the  Appellant  provided
    witness  statements  from  family  and  friends,  utility  bills,  bank
    statements and additional documentation.  The judge found the Appellant
    to be a reluctant witness  but  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  gave
    consistent answers to the questions he asked.  The judge found that the
    Appellant and the Sponsor were consistent in 58  out  of  63  questions
    asked  in  interview.   He  acknowledged   that   some   answers   were
    significantly discrepant but found that the parties displayed a certain
    vagueness which was intrinsic in  their  nature  and  characters.   The
    judge found that the  parties  were  naï¿½ve  and  the  small  number  of
    discrepancies in interview were not significant enough to damage  their
    credibility in the light of the totality of the evidence.

4.   The Respondent appealed on the grounds that the  judge  had  failed  to
    provide adequate reasons for finding that the relationship was  genuine
    and subsisting given the judge's finding that  some  of  the  responses
    given  by  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  during   interview   were
    significantly  discrepant  and  there  was   insufficient   documentary
    evidence to confirm the relationship.  In submissions Ms Everett relied
    on the  grounds  of  appeal  and  submitted  that,  in  view  of  those
    significant discrepancies  in  interview,  the  reasons  given  in  the
    decision were inadequate.  She specifically referred  to  questions  38
    and 39 of the interview record in which the Appellant stated he had met
    the Sponsor's father but the Sponsor stated that they had never met.

5.   After some discussion it was decided that it was not necessary to  hear
    from the Appellant's representative. Our decision is  as  follows.  The
    Appellant gave explanations for the discrepancies in interview  in  his
    witness statement and he adopted his witness statement as part  of  his
    evidence-in-chief.   He  was  cross-examined  and  he   answered   some
    questions from the judge.  The Sponsor gave answers consistent with the
    Appellant in oral evidence.  The judge took  into  account  documentary
    evidence which indicated that the Appellant and the  Sponsor  had  been
    living at the same address for some time.   There  were  insurance  and
    life insurance policies in their names and the judge took into  account
    the witness statements from friends and relatives.

6.   We find that the judge assessed the evidence as a whole and  considered
    the discrepancies in interview in the light of all the evidence.  There
    was no error of law in the judge's approach and his findings were  open
    to him on  the  evidence  before  him.   Although  the  judge  did  not
    specifically deal with each discrepancy and explanation for it, stating
    whether he accepted or rejected it, it is clear from his decision  that
    he considered those discrepancies and the explanations.  We  find  that
    the judge's reasons at  paragraphs  15  to  20  of  the  decision  were
    adequate and there was no material error of law.   The  decision  dated
    1st December 2014 shall stand and the Secretary of  State's  appeal  is
    dismissed.
