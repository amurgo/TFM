                                                                  Respondent



Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Chowdhury of EI Solicitors.

For the Respondent:    Mr Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals  against  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (the "FtT") whereby  its  dismissed  his  appeal  against  the
    decision made on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department (the "Secretary of State"), dated 16 July 2013, refusing his
    application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant.  One of the main issues was the relationship
    of the Appellant with his mother and evidence in support thereof.


 2. Upon the listing of this appeal on 10 July 2014, Mr Smart, on behalf of
    the Secretary of State, stated that  enquiries  conducted  by  him  had
    established that when the impugned  decision  was  made  an  error  was
    committed, consisting of the inadvertent disregard of  the  Appellant's
    birth certificate.  He indicated that, in consequence, the  immigration
    decision is withdrawn and he applied under  Rule  17  to  withdraw  the
    Secretary  of  State's   case,   with   a   view   to   undertaking   a
    reconsideration.

 3.  No  opposing  submission  was  made  on  behalf  of   the   Appellant.
    Accordingly, I granted permission  under  Rule  17.  I  set  aside  the
    decision of the FtT.  There will be  a  fee  award  in  favour  of  the
    Appellant.
