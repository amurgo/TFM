Representation:
Appellant:    Not present and unrepresented
Respondent:   Mr Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal was listed for hearing today  (13  November  2014).   By  a
    letter dated 12 November 2014, the Appellant's solicitors  communicated
    the following request:

         "The Appellant initially  intended  for  an  oral  hearing  of  the
         appeal.  However, under her personal extenuating circumstances, our
         instructions now confirm that the Appellant wants a  paper  hearing
         of her above referred appeal."


    The remaining contents of  the  letter  were  consequential  upon  this
    request. Consistent therewith, the Appellant did not attend  today  and
    was not represented.  Some very brief submissions were made  on  behalf
    of the Respondent by Mr Richards.

 2. This appeal originates in a decision made on behalf of the  Respondent,
    dated 07 August 2013, whereby  the  application  of  the  Appellant,  a
    Chinese national aged 26 years, for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant was  refused.   The  ensuing
    appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  (the  "FtT")  was  dismissed.   The
    Appellant appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 3. The primary reason for the Respondent's refusal decision  is  expressed
    thus:

         "In your application, you submitted a letter and account statements
         from Affin Bank. I am  satisfied  that  the  documents  were  false
         because the bank have confirmed  that  they  have  not  issued  the
         documents ....


         As  false  documents  have  been  submitted  in  relation  to  your
         application,  it  is  refused  under  paragraph  322(1A)   of   the
         Immigration Rules."

    A second refusal reason was added.   This  is,  in  essence,  that  the
    application was not considered genuine on the ground  of  contradictory
    statements made by the Appellant  and  her  proposed  business  partner
    relating to the origins  of  the  funds  allegedly  available  for  the
    purpose of establishing the business in question, a Chinese  fast  food
    outlet.  This reason is duly particularised in the refusal decision.

 4. The evidence served by the Respondent in connection with the hearing at
    first instance included the document verification enquiry addressed  to
    the bank in question and  the  response  of  the  latter.  The  enquiry
    stated:

         "The attached document is in the name of  [XY]  who  holds  a  bank
         account with your bank.  Mr [XY] is sponsoring [the  Appellant  and
         the other named person] in support of their visa application in the
         United Kingdom, who has  [sic]  submitted  bank  letters  and  bank
         statement from  your  institution.   Can  you  please  confirm  the
         following details:


           . The document submitted to the Home Office (see attached scanned
             copy) is genuine/not genuine as issued?


           . The account balance as of 06 December 2012 [amount]  belongs to
             [XY]?

           . The account number [specified] belongs to [XY]?"


    This elicited the following swift response:


         "With reference to the document you had email [sic]  to  me  today,
         31/07/2013, we wish to confirm that the Bank  had  not  issued  the
         document and these documents are not genuine."

    The author of this  response  is  described  as  the  "Manager,  Branch
    Services" of the bank concerned.

 5. The following  features  of  the  FtT's  determination  illuminate  the
    grounds upon which the appeal was dismissed:

    (i)  The Judge refused an initial application to adjourn  the  hearing,
         for the expressed purpose of securing evidence from  "XY"/the  bank
         concerned  to  demonstrate  the  authenticity   of   the   relevant
         documents, on  the  ground  of  late  timing  and  the  Appellant's
         admitted failure to make any real attempt to secure  this  evidence
         during the previous eight months.

    (ii) In [9], the Judge  recorded:  "The  burden  of  proof  is  on  the
         appellant and the standard  of  proof  required  is  a  balance  of
         probabilities".

    (iii)     The  Appellant's  pre-decision  interview  and  the  document
         verification evidence were noted.

    (iv)  The  Appellant  was  asked  in  cross-examination   whether   her
         application had been made in the knowledge that she  did  not  have
         access to the necessary funds:

             "The Appellant did not reply, but  clearly  nodded  her  head.
             The presenting officer asked if I had  seen  the  response.  I
             confirmed I had observed it ....


             It was submitted that the Appellant has lied about the  source
             of her funds in her .... interview  and  as  accepted  at  the
             hearing, by nodding, that this is solely her opportunist (sic)
             attempt to stay in the K."

    (v)  Describing the Appellant's  demeanour  and  her  evidence  to  the
         Tribunal, the Judge stated:

             "She was mostly ignorant in respect of any question about  her
             sponsor or the money that he would supposedly invest.  At  one
             point she struggled even to remember his name.  She  has  lied
             about him being a family member and her uncle, when he  is  in
             fact the uncle of ....  her business partner ....


             The idea that she would  receive  ï¿½200,000  in  funds  from  a
             sponsor who she had never met, is not related to and  who  she
             has been unable to contact  is  simply  not  believable.   Her
             whole demeanour suggested that she was caught in a trap of her
             own making."

              See [24] of the determination.

    (vi) "I find as a fact that the letter and the  statement  referred  to
         are not  genuine"  and  that  the  evidence  of  falsification  "is
         compelling evidence of deception": see [25].

     vii) "The Appellant did not speak the words when  this  deception  was
          put to her, but she did nod her  head  in  resignation  to  being
          found out": see [26].


    viii) "The Appellant has been unable to demonstrate at hearing that she
          satisfied the requirements of the Immigration Rules, as  required
          .....


         On the totality of the evidence before me, I find, for the  reasons
         above recorded, that the Appellant has not discharged the burden of
         proof and the reasons  given  by  the  Respondent  do  justify  the
         refusal": see [31] and [32].

    The FtT's overall conclusion was that  the  impugned  decision  was  in
    accordance with the law and the applicable Immigration Rules.

 6. Permission to appeal to this Tribunal  was  granted  on  the  following
    basis:

         "....  There is an arguable error of law in that the Judge  wrongly
         states that the burden of proof lies on the Appellant and makes  no
         self direction that the burden of proof, where an  allegation  that
         false representations  have  been  made  and  false  documents  are
         produced, lies on the Respondent."

    I find that there was indeed an error of law of this variety.   As  the
    passages reproduced above demonstrate, the FtT repeatedly  stated  that
    the burden of  proof  rested  on  the  Appellant,  effectively  in  all
    respects.  There is no reference,  implied  or  even  oblique,  to  the
    Respondent's burden in relation to the alleged deception.

 7. However, I am satisfied that this error of  law  is  not  material.   I
    concur with the Judge's description of the  evidence  of  deception  as
    "compelling".  I have subjected  this  evidence  to  careful  scrutiny.
    Moreover, I have juxtaposed  it  with  the  relevant  passages  in  the
    determination, rehearsed above.   Having  conducted  this  exercise,  I
    conclude confidently that if the error of  law  had  been  avoided  the
    outcome would have been the same.  Alternatively  phrased,  I  consider
    that had the  requisite  self-direction  been  made  the  result  would
    inevitably have been a dismiss of the appeal.

 8. I have also reflected carefully on the "Appellant nodding"  issue,  set
    out in [5] (iv) above.  I consider that a gesture of this  kind,  which
    has scope for ambiguity, misinterpretation and misunderstanding  should
    normally be probed by a Tribunal by appropriate questions, with a  view
    to eliciting desirable clarification and confirmation.   This  did  not
    occur.  My reservations about this were exacerbated  by  the  following
    passage in the record of the Appellant's pre-decision interview:

         "The  applicant's  level  of  verbal  English  was  poor  and   the
         interviewing officer  had  to  reiterate  each  question  asked  in
         several different ways before the applicant understood."

    None of this is acknowledged in the judgment.   However,  I  take  into
    account that at the hearing  before  the  FtT  the  Appellant  had  the
    benefit of legal  representation  and,  moreover,  no  interpreter  was
    required. In addition, within the text of the determination there is no
    hint of  any  communication,  comprehension  or  language  barriers  or
    difficulties.  Accordingly, while this factor, in  the  abstract,   has
    the potential to  vitiate  a  Tribunal's  decision  on  the  ground  of
    procedural unfairness, I am satisfied that it did not  do  so  in  this
    instance.

DECISION

 9. Finally, I am satisfied that there was no unfairness in the adjournment
    Refusal, as I have found  to  be  legally  sustainable  the  FtT's  key
    finding of a fairytale.  On the grounds and for the reasons  elaborated
    above I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.  The decision  of  the  FtT  is
    hereby affirmed.
