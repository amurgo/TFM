                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS

     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Andrew promulgated on 28 October 2016 in which the Judge  dismissed
        the appellants' appeals against the respondent's refusal  to  issue
        them with Residence Cards as confirmation of their right to  reside
        in the United Kingdom as direct family members of an  EEA  national
        exercising treaty rights in the UK.




Background


     2. The appellants, a husband and wife, are citizens of India the first
        appellant having been born on  24  February  1950  and  the  second
        appellant on 3 June 1956.

     3. It is not disputed that the appellant's son, an Italian citizen, is
        exercising treaty rights in the UK.

     4. The Judge also records at [3] that it was common  ground  that  the
        only issue in the appeal was whether the appellants were  dependent
        on their Italian citizen son. Having considered the  evidence  with
        the required degree of anxious scrutiny  the  Judge  sets  out  her
        findings of fact from [4] of the decision  under  challenge.  Those
        findings may be summarised in the following terms:

           a. The assertion made by the appellants and  sponsor  that  they
              lived in Italy  as  they  were  dependent  upon  the  Italian
              national sponsor and  had  been  issued  residence  cards  or
              permits is noted although the Judge found she was  unable  to
              place any weight upon the documentary  evidence  provided  to
              confirm this assertion which had not been translated [8].

           b. The Judge only had assertions to the effect the sponsor  gave
              the appellants money for their support after they returned to
              live in India in 2012 [9].

           c. The appellants travelled to the United Kingdom  in  2013.  In
              their first visa application, the  first  appellant  did  not
              state the purpose of the visit was to visit the sponsor,  but
              his nephew and that he intended to stay for a period  of  two
              weeks although stayed for four months. The Judge  also  noted
              that despite referring to his son, the sponsor,  at  question
              54 the first appellant did not  say  he  was  now  exercising
              treaty rights in the UK.  Dates are given for travel to Italy
              but there is no  mention  of  the  first  appellant  actually
              living in that country [10].

           d. The Visa application form showed that even though  the  first
              appellant is retired he has  substantial  wealth  and  income
              [13].

           e. A second Visa application form indicated the first  appellant
              intended to stay in the United Kingdom for six weeks  to  see
              his son  and  daughter-in-law.  The  Judge  noted  the  first
              appellant confirmed  he  had  savings,  property,  and  other
              income from stocks and shares and that his son, the  sponsor,
              is to pay for the cost of his  trip  to  the  United  Kingdom
              [14].

           f. The Judge concludes there was  nothing  in  the  second  Visa
              application form either to show that the claims made  by  the
              appellants and the sponsor that they have been  dependent  on
              the sponsor are credible and that his merely paying the costs
              of the trip does not mean the  appellants  are  dependent  on
              their son [15].

           g. The Judge notes that despite saying they only wish to stay in
              the United Kingdom for a period of six weeks on 29 June  2015
              about five months after the date  of  their  visit  Visa  the
              appellants  applied  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as
              dependents of their son, the sponsor [16].

           h. The Judge accepted evidence had  been  provided  of  receipts
              from Western Union sent by the sponsor to  the  appellant  in
              India in 2014 but the purpose of the money and  for  what  it
              was sent was not known. Merely sending money  to  India  does
              not show the appellants are dependent on their son [17].

           i. The Judge accepts the appellants are  presently  living  with
              their son in the  United  Kingdom  although  other  than  the
              assertions made the Judge found there  was  nothing  to  show
              they are dependent upon him for  their  income.  It  is  said
              there was nothing to show payments made to the appellants  in
              the sponsor's bank statement shows the payments are for  rent
              or the basic necessities of living such as  fuel  bills  "and
              the like" [18].

           j. At [20] the Judge writes:




                  "In  this  case  the   Appellants   misrepresented   their
                  intentions on entry to the United Kingdom. Their  evidence
                  was not credible, given the information contained  in  the
                  VAF's  that  contradicts  the  evidence  I  was  asked  to
                  believe. There was no documentary evidence to confirm  the
                  assertions that were being made by the Appellants and  the
                  Sponsor. Although the Sponsor may have a  house  in  India
                  built on the First Appellants land it seems  that  he  has
                  lived in this for such  short  periods  of  time  that  it
                  cannot be considered to be his  household.  In  any  event
                  there  is  no  evidence  before  me  that  the  house   is
                  recognised as being that of the Sponsor again  other  than
                  the assertions made by Appellants and the  Sponsor.  There
                  was nothing before  me  to  show  the  claimed  amount  of
                  material support needed by the Appellants  to  meet  their
                  essential living needs or that any of this was supplied by
                  the Sponsor."




           k. The Judge was not satisfied on the evidence before  her  that
              the appellants are now, or have in the past,  been  dependent
              on the sponsor.

     5. The appellants sought permission  to  appeal  which  was  initially
        refused by another judge of the First-tier Tribunal but granted  on
        a renewed application by a judge of the Upper Tribunal  on  8  June
        2017, the operative part of the grant being in the following terms:

             "Arguably the  judge  erred  by  considering  the  appellant's
             application as extended  family  members  rather  than  family
             members and therefore arguably failed to focus on the question
             of dependency in the UK. Given the judge's findings at [18] it
             may  well  be  that  any  arguable  error  is  in  any   event
             immaterial.   Nevertheless   the   matter   requires   further
             discussion  and  consideration.  Accordingly   permission   is
             granted and all grounds may be argued."




Error of law


     6. On behalf of the appellants Mr Ali argued that the Judge focused on
        the requirements of  Regulation  8  rather  than  Regulation  7  in
        relation to which there is a clear distinction, as with  Regulation
        8 there is the need to satisfy both prior  and  current  dependency
        which is stated not to be the case under Regulation 7. It is argued
        the Judge should have properly focused  on  whether  the  financial
        support provided by the EEA national to the appellants was for  the
        purpose of meeting their "essential  needs"  at  the  date  of  the
        hearing     considering     the     evidence     and     appellants
        individual/collective circumstances.

     7. Mr Ali also argues there was no evidence before the Judge regarding
        the appellant's circumstances and it was clear the  appellants  did
        not have any financial means to support themselves such  as  to  be
        able to meet their "essential needs".  It was therefore clear  that
        the appellant's needs would be met by their son with whom they were
        living since their arrival in the United Kingdom. It is argued  the
        evidence was consistent and that the appellants had  no  source  of
        income of their own and that the appellants had  lived  with  their
        son as family members in Italy between 2007 to 2012. Mr Ali submits
        that although documents were not translated they have been provided
        to the respondent who did not raise any challenge  in  relation  to
        them and that the  Indian  passports  provided  by  the  appellants
        proved they had lived in Italy as claimed.  It  was  submitted  the
        unmistakable  evidence  of  financial  remittances  from  the   EEA
        national  were  rejected  based  on  conjecture,  speculation,  and
        assumptions, whereas this clearly showed that money was sent to the
        appellants to meet their essential needs. It is  submitted  on  the
        appellant's  behalf  that  witness  statements  confirm  the  money
        submitted to the appellants was to meet their essential  needs.  It
        is also submitted the Judge accepted the appellant's son is in  the
        United  Kingdom  exercising  treaty  rights  and  that   the   bank
        statements were provided by the Appellant son. Even if there was no
        evidence of why the money was paid from the bank account,  the  son
        paid all the housing costs which was not disputed. It was submitted
        that if the case is considered in the  correct  context  the  facts
        prove dependency and that the appellant should therefore succeed.

     8. The argument as to whether regulation 7 or regulation 8 was applied
        is arguably academic as the Judge at [5] noted that it  was  common
        ground  that  the  only  issue  was  whether  the  appellants  were
        dependent on their Italian son. This was the only matter upon which
        the Judge was required to make a  finding.  The  criticism  of  the
        Judge for referring to the case  of  Moneke  at  [19]  is  arguably
        unwarranted as this  is  a  reference  by  the  Judge  to  guidance
        provided by the Upper Tribunal in relation to how evidence  adduced
        for the purposes of discharging the burden of proof to  demonstrate
        eligibility should be assessed. It has not been made  out  that  in
        setting out findings relevant to the key issue the Judge  made  any
        mention of prior dependency or any findings in relation to the same
        pertinent to the assessment of the Regulation 7  issue.  The  Judge
        refers to evidence of assets including ownership  of  the  property
        but no more.

     9. A reading of the evidence and the decision  shows  there  were  two
        concerns in the mind of the Judge being (A) lack  of  evidence  and
        (B) credibility.

    10. The issue regarding the provision of translated  documents  is  not
        raised in the renewed grounds these again may only be  relevant  to
        the background as what may have happened, initially prior to  2012,
        does not establish the required element of dependency at  the  date
        of the hearing.

    11. The Judge noted that  the  appellants  receives  money  from  other
        sources including the son in the United Kingdom and notes  that  it
        is given by the appellants to family members. The core  finding  at
        [18] is that the appellants had not discharged the burden upon them
        to  required  standard  to  show  that  the  core  issue  had  been
        satisfied. The money transfers referred to by the Judge,  a  couple
        dated 2014 and another 2003, make it arguably open to the Judge  to
        express concern about the quality of the evidence adduced to  prove
        the required element of dependency and to find  the  appellant  had
        not discharged the  burden  of  proof  upon  him  to  the  required
        standard. The fact the appellants were living at their son's house,
        having entered the UK as visitors under  domestic  legislation  was
        noted by the Judge, but this was not determinative  of  the  issue.
        Statements were all taken into account with the required degree  of
        anxious scrutiny and adequate reasons given for the findings  made.
        The assertion the Judge gave inappropriate weight by  reference  to
        speculation has no arguable merit as it was for the Judge to decide
        what weight should be given to the evidence. Mere disagreement with
        the outcome or a  belief  that  greater  weight  should  have  been
        attached to certain aspects  of  the  evidence  does  not  arguably
        establish legal error material  to  the  decision  to  dismiss  the
        appeal.

    12. In ECO Manilla v Lim [2015] EWCA  Civ  1383  the  appellant  sought
        entry, as the family member of an EU national.  The  appellant  had
        savings and a retirement fund in excess of �55,000  and  she  owned
        her own  home  in  Malaysia  valued  at  �80,000.  The  appellant's
        daughter, married to the EU national, sent  her  �450  per  quarter
        which she used to meet her expenses without spending  any  capital.
        Applying Reyes v Migrationsverket (Case C- 423/12) it was held that
        it was not enough to show that the financial support  was  in  fact
        provided by the EU citizen to a family member;  the  family  member
        must need that support in order to  meet  her  basic  needs;  there
        needed to exist a situation of real dependence; receipt of  support
        was a necessary condition  of  dependency,  but  not  a  sufficient
        condition; and it was necessary to determine that the family member
        was dependent in the sense of being  in  need  of  assistance  even
        though it was irrelevant why she was dependent. If,  as  here,  the
        family member could support herself, there was no  dependency  even
        though she was given financial support from the EU citizen.

    13. It is an arguably sustainable finding that the test of  whether  an
        applicant requires the 'material' support  of  the  EU  citizen  in
        order to meet his 'essential' needs had not been shown  to  be  met
        for the reasons given by the Judge.



Decision

    14. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.

    15. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.

        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
