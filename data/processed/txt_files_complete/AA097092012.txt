For the appellant:     Mr H Cheng, instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
For the respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, KSR, date of birth 1.1.69, is a citizen of Somalia.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Elson, who dismissed her  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent,  dated  11.10.12,  to  refuse  her   asylum,   humanitarian
    protection, and human rights claims, and to remove her from the  UK  by
    way of directions.  The Judge heard the appeal on 11.4.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge French granted permission to appeal on 6.614.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Elson should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant's claim for asylum was that she would face  mistreatment  due
    to her race,  as  a  member  of  the  Midgan  clan,  and  had  suffered
    discrimination because of her minority clan membership. She claimed  to
    have been born in Qooroly, Midole in the lower Shabelle  region,  about
    100 miles from Mogadishu. She claimed that on 6.9.09  a  group  of  men
    from Al Shabaab came to her home, accused her and her husband of  being
    traitors, and threatened to kill them. The men returned 2  days  later,
    attacking both of them. Her husband escaped but was shot in  the  hand.
    She was taken prisoner and detained in a house for 2 months, accused of
    spying for the government. She was assisted to escape  as  one  of  her
    guards was a friend of her husband. She later  collected  the  children
    for whom she was responsible, two sisters and a nephew, and took a  bus
    to meet up with her husband in Mogadishu. It was agreed that she should
    leave Somalia for her own safety. They could not all afford to  go  but
    her husband raised $3,000 to pay agents to help her flee Somalia.

 7. She claimed that she would face a real risk  of  unlawful  killing  and
    torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment on return  and
    a serious and individual threat to her life  or  person  by  reason  of
    indiscriminate violence in a situation  of  international  or  internal
    armed conflict. With the assistance of agents, she  left  Mogadishu  on
    3.12.09 for an unknown Arab country from where she flew to  the  UK  on
    23.12.09. Her claim for asylum was refused on 22.1.10  and  her  appeal
    dismissed on 4.5.10. However, she made  further  representations  which
    were accepted as a fresh claim  and  resulting  in  a  further  refusal
    decision, dated 11.10.12.

 8. Judge Elson found that the appellant's  account  contained  unexplained
    inconsistencies and  anomalies,  as  had  the  judge  in  the  previous
    determination. Relying on Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 000702,  Judge  Elson
    found  no  reason  not  to  rely  on  the  earlier  findings  of  fact.
    Ultimately, Judge Elson considered the evidence adduced on the part  of
    the appellant to be neither plausible nor credible. However, the  judge
    found that on the basis of the language expert evidence, the  appellant
    was from Southern  Somalia.  The  judge  found  on  the  basis  of  the
    background  material  that  the  situation  in  Somalia  had   improved
    considerably since  the  promulgation  of  AMM,  concluding  that  such
    violence that continues in Somalia was not at  a  level  sufficient  to
    place the appellant in need of international protection, and that  even
    when violence and human rights abuses were prevalent a person should be
    safe in an area controlled by his/her clan.

 9. The judge reached the conclusion that in light of credibility  findings
    the appellant failed to make out her case  as  a  refugee  or  risk  on
    return. The judge also found that article 15(c)  of  the  Qualification
    Directive,  the  objective  material  did  not  indicate  a  level   of
    indiscriminate violence to meet the threshold.  The  judge  also  found
    that article 8 was not engaged.

10. In essence the grounds submit  that  although  the  judge  recited  the
    submissions made at the hearing and found, contrary to the respondent's
    submission, that the appellant was from  Southern  Somalia,  the  judge
    failed to give adequate reasons as to why she rejected the  appellant's
    case. The grounds further submit that there were  no  findings  on  the
    appellant's claim  to  be  at  heightened  risk  as  a  result  of  her
    particular circumstances. It is also claimed that the  judge  erred  in
    her application of  AMM  and  others  (Conflict;  humanitarian  crisis;
    returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011] UKUT 445  (IAC),  to  the  particular
    facts of the appellant's case.

11. In granting permission to appeal on all  grounds,  Judge  French  found
    arguable merit in the grounds, with  reference  to  MK  (duty  to  give
    reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641 (IAC) in relation to the failure to
    give adequate reasons.

12. The Rule 24 response of the Secretary of State, dated 19.6.14,  accepts
    that whilst all the evidence was properly set  out,  the  determination
    was not as clear and well-reasoned  as  it  could  have  been.  "It  is
    however considered immaterial. Taking  the  findings  of  the  previous
    Judge as a  starting  point,  the  Judge  was  entitled  to  doubt  the
    appellant's credibility, and having found in her favour regarding where
    in Somalia she originated from, did  not  indicate  that  the  previous
    Judge's findings were unreliable. Although the judge does not spell  it
    out in her conclusions, it is clear that she finds that  the  situation
    in Southern Somalia to have changed since the promulgation of the  most
    recent Country Guidance case. Her recitation of the  evidence  provided
    by the respondent, indicates that she had more than sufficient evidence
    to come to this conclusion."

13. The judge was entitled to take the  findings  of  the  2010  First-tier
    Tribunal as the starting point, including the  very  detailed  findings
    and reasons for those findings as  to  credibility.  I  note  that  the
    skeleton argument for the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing sought  to
    reopen and criticised the determination of 2010. However, Judge  Dennis
    found at �21 that the appellant had produced no supporting  documentary
    or other evidence to assist in evaluating her claim. It rested entirely
    on her own account of events, contained in her screening interview, her
    asylum interview and her testimony at the 2010  appeal  hearing.  Judge
    Dennis found the appellant neither a credible nor  a  reliable  witness
    and that her account was implausible, giving  detailed  cogent  reasons
    for  reaching  that  conclusion.  At  �33  he  said  her  evidence  was
    characterised by a complete lack of reliability and  concluded  at  �25
    that her evidence was unreliable and a "conscious misrepresentation."

14. After reviewing in considerable detail the evidence and the submissions
    of the parties, at �69 Judge Elson noted the  respondent's  submissions
    as to why the 2010 findings  should  not  be  disturbed  and  that  the
    appellant  continued  to  give  accounts  that  contained  inadequately
    explained inconsistencies and anomalies. The appellant's representative
    submitted that the appellant  had  explain  the  discrepancies  in  her
    evidence and had not been inconsistent. However, at �77 the judge noted
    that the present claim was based on the same factual matrix  and  thus,
    in line with Devaseelan, this second appeal  should  be  determined  in
    line with the first, noting that as an assessment of the  matters  that
    were before the earlier Tribunal it should be regarded as  unquestioned
    and that it is not the role of the second judge to  consider  arguments
    intended to undermine the first judge's determination. In essence,  the
    appellant was attempting to re-argue the same  factual  issues  as  had
    been determined against her by Judge Dennis, but doing so only  by  her
    further personal evidence.

15. At �79 Judge Elson found that nothing had been placed before  her  that
    could not have been placed before  the  earlier  judge  and  cited  the
    guidance of Devaseelan to the effect that with regard to  matters  that
    could have been before the first judge such evidence should be  treated
    with the greatest circumspection. An appellant who seeks,  in  a  later
    appeal, to add to the available facts in an effort  to  obtain  a  more
    favourable outcome is properly regarded with suspicion from  the  point
    of view of credibility. Whilst the force of this is somewhat reduced if
    there is some very good reason  why  the  failure  to  adduce  relevant
    evidence before the first judge should not be held  against  him,  such
    reasons will be rare. No such very good reasons have been produced and,
    as stated above, the appellant was simply trying to  reargue  the  case
    relying on the same factual claim.

16. Mr Cheng's submissions were to the effect that if the appellant was not
    misleading the judge as to where she was from,  that  must  affect  the
    other credibility findings of the first judge who did not  accept  that
    she was from Southern Somalia and the judge had to look  again  at  the
    appellant's  evidence  and  responses.  Mr  Cheng  pointed  to  further
    explanation from the appellant. However, Ms Isherwood  rightly  pointed
    out that there was no additional evidence other than the  word  of  the
    discredited appellant to  demonstrate  that  her  factual  account  was
    truthful. The case still turns  largely  on  the  appellant's  personal
    evidence. The fact that she was from Southern Somalia does not open the
    door to a complete reassessment of  the  credibility  findings  of  the
    previous judge, unless and only to the extent that they depend on  that
    finding.  There  were  clear  and  cogent  reasons  for  rejecting  the
    appellant's account, quite independent of her origin.

17. It is clear that Judge Elson did not close her mind to further evidence
    and carefully considered the further linguistic reports, finding in the
    appellant's favour that she is from Southern Somalia. However,  in  the
    view of Judge Elson, this did nothing to upset  the  other  credibility
    findings of Judge Dennis, which were maintained and relied upon in  �79
    to �81 of the current determination. I find that it  was  open  to  the
    judge to do so.

18. In relation to AMM, at �357 the Upper Tribunal found that there  was  a
    category of middle class or professional persons in Mogadishu  who  can
    live to a reasonable standard and for  whom  the  article  15(c)  risk,
    which exists for the great majority of the population, does not  apply.
    A returnee to such a milieu would not run an article 15(c)  risk,  even
    if forcibly returned, quite apart from the 'powerful actors'  category.
    Regardless of where the appellant is from, the 2010 Tribunal found that
    she and her husband had elected to live in Mogadishu and appear to have
    been living there comfortably running small enterprises, which  enabled
    her husband to raise $3,000 to fund her flight from Somalia.

19. Mr Cheng submitted that Judge Elson had failed to engage with AMM,  but
    on the basis of the findings of Judge Dennis, there was  no  basis  for
    considering that there was a risk on return  to  Mogadishu,  where  the
    appellant's husband continued to live and with whom she was in contact.
    Regardless of where she was from, the appellant  and  her  husband  had
    moved to settle and work in Mogadishu. AMM found a risk  on  return  to
    south central Somalia owing to the presence  of  Al  Shabab  where  the
    person had been away from that area, but there was no question in  this
    case of requiring the appellant to return to South Somalia;  she  would
    be returned to Mogadishu and would be able to resume  her  relationship
    with her husband in that location.

20. In any event, Judge Elson detailed in the determination,  including  at
    �55, the  background  evidence  relied  on  by  the  respondent,  which
    suggests that the situation has changed since the promulgation of  AMM,
    suggesting that there had been an  improvement  in  security  and  that
    large parts of southern and central Somalia  were  relatively  peaceful
    and that it was safe to travel from the airport into Mogadishu and that
    the armed conflict in Mogadishu did not pose a real risk of  article  3
    harm, regardless of circumstances. Al Shahbab had also  withdrawn  from
    the appellant's claimed home area of Qooroly. At �83, evidently relying
    on this evidence, Judge Elson found that  there  was  not  a  level  of
    indiscriminate violence to meet the article 15(c) threshold. The  judge
    noted that the appellant is a woman, but her  own  case  was  that  her
    husband was still in Somalia and from his  use  of  phone  centres  was
    likely to be still in  Mogadishu.  Thus  the  appellant  would  not  be
    returning as a lone woman and she would not be particularly  vulnerable
    on return, so that the risk to her was no  greater  than  that  of  the
    population in general.

21. In his revised  skeleton  argument,  Mr  Cheng  points  to  the  recent
    decision of the Upper Tribunal in  MOJ  &  Ors  (return  to  Mogadishu)
    Somalia CG [2014] and no longer  relies  on  the  previous  grounds  in
    relation to AMM. In �337 of MOJ it is stated that the clear evidence is
    that in Mogadishu there is no inter-clan violence taking place  and  no
    real risk of serious discriminatory treatment on  the  basis  of  clan,
    though it remains the case that clan membership may remain important to
    social and economic support in Mogadishu.  It  is  no  doubt  for  that
    reason that Mr Cheng was obliged to alter the basis of the  appeal.  At
    �342, the Tribunal stated that for a returnee to Mogadishu today,  clan
    membership is not a potential risk factor but something relevant to the
    extent  to  which  he  will  be  able  to  receive  assistance  in  re-
    establishing himself on return, especially if he has no close relatives
    to turn to upon  arrival.  However  this  appellant  returning  to  her
    husband in Mogadishu and a situation where she  and  her  husband  were
    able to live comfortably. At �344 -346 the Tribunal noted a  remarkable
    economic boom in Mogadishu with huge inward investment with large-scale
    construction  projects.  Huge  numbers  have  returned  to   Mogadishu,
    indicative of a  considerable  reduction  in  levels  of  violence  and
    improvements in security. All of this led the Tribunal to  conclude  at
    �355 onwards that there was a sufficiency of protection, even if not in
    an orthodox way.

22. As highlighted in the skeleton argument and his oral  submissions,  the
    revised argument of the appellant is that AMM is unaffected by  MOJ  in
    relation to the specific risk to the  appellant  returning  as  a  lone
    woman and thus would have an additional vulnerability  over  and  above
    the characteristics of the average returnee. I accept that at �333  MOJ
    states that in respect of issues not addressed in  that  determination,
    AMM continues to have country  guidance  effect.   However,  I  do  not
    accept Mr Cheng's argument, as it ignores the facts as found  that  the
    appellant would not be a  lone  woman  in  Somalia,  as  she  would  be
    returning to her husband in  Mogadishu,  with  whom  she  has  retained
    regular  contact.  Judge  Elson  alluded  to  this  at   �35   of   her
    determination. I find that there is insufficient to suggest that  there
    was any such risk that could and should have  been  considered  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal. There is no merit whatsoever  in  the  lone  woman
    argument, the submission to which the  appellant's  representative  has
    had to resort in the light of MOJ.

23. In reality, there was nothing new  before  Judge  Elson  that  had  not
    already been determined by Judge Dennis. Whilst the determination could
    have been better structured and made more clear, I find that any  error
    was one of form or  structure  and  not  of  substance.  There  was  no
    material error and, other than the finding that the appellant was  from
    Southern Somalia, there was no reason to reopen the  factual  basis  of
    the appellant's claim, solely on the further 'explanations' she  wished
    to proffer as  to  discrepancies.  The  appellant's  account  has  been
    comprehensively found to be implausible, not credible and inconsistent.
    There was nothing significant put before  Judge  Elson  that  justified
    overturning the clear and cogent findings of Judge Dennis

24. In the circumstances, I find no error in Judge Elson's determination.

Conclusion & Decision:

25. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case.
