Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Azam, sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Bell promulgated on 23 June 2015 in which he allowed the appeal  of  Mr
    Muhammad Humair, a citizen of Pakistan, born on 20 June 1988.


2.   Although before me the Entry Clearance Officer is the appellant and  Mr
    Humair is the respondent, for the sake of consistency with the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal I shall refer to Mr Humair as the  Appellant
    and the Entry Clearance Officer as the Respondent.

3.   The Appellant made an application for entry clearance as the spouse  of
    Ms Zainab Azam ('the sponsor'). The application was made on 18 December
    2013.


4.    The  application  was  initially  refused  by  way  of  a  Notice   of
    Immigration Decision dated 11 July 2014.  It  appears  that  the  delay
    between the application and the decision was in some  part  because  of
    the ongoing litigation in respect of amendments made to the Immigration
    Rules with regard to financial requirements for  partners  and  spouses
    applying for  entry  clearance,  such  litigation  culminating  in  the
    decision of MM (Lebanon) and Others [2014] EWCA Civ 985.   Indeed  when
    the decision of 11 July 2014 was made a number of reasons for  refusing
    the application were advanced before the decision maker turned  his  or
    her mind to the issue of the financial requirements.  In  that  regard,
    although a preliminary observation was made  to  the  effect  that  the
    requirements of the Rules were  not  met,  the  Notice  of  Immigration
    Decision includes the following;

         "However, no final determination has been made at this stage as  to
         whether you meet the income  threshold  and/or  related  evidential
         requirements. This is because the courts have not yet  decided  the
         outcome of the Secretary of State's appeal in a legal challenge  to
         the income threshold requirement.  More information about  this  is
         set out on the Home Office website.
         If you appeal against this refusal decision, a final  determination
         as  to  whether  you  meet  the  income  threshold  and/or  related
         evidential requirements under the Rules may  be  made  at  a  later
         stage. In making any such determination account will  be  taken  of
         any further information or documents regarding the income threshold
         and/or related evidential requirements which you enclosed with your
         appeal."


5.   A second decision was made in due course on 7 January  2015.   I  pause
    to note that in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge these two
    decisions are referred to at paragraphs 4 and 5, and the Judge  appears
    to have been mistaken as to the date of the second decision which was 7
    January 2015 and not 11 July 2014 as appears  at  paragraph  5  of  the
    decision.  Be that as it may nothing for present purposes turns on what
    appears to be no more than a slip.


6.   The later decision of January 2015 took account  of  various  documents
    and  information  sent  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  concerning  the
    sponsor's employment in the United  Kingdom,  particularly  seeking  to
    address some of the issues raised in the first decision.  The decision-
    maker of 7 January 2015 states "You have since demonstrated  that  your
    application  met  the  non-income  threshold  requirements  which  that
    refusal notice gave as the reasons for refusal."  Accordingly the  only
    outstanding issue as of 7 January 2015 was in relation to the financial
    requirements of the Rules.

7.   It is not immediately apparent that any indication  was  given  to  the
    Appellant prior to the decision of 7 January 2015 that a  new  decision
    was about to be taken, and to that end it is not  immediately  apparent
    that any updating financial information was provided.   Accordingly  it
    appears that the decision of 7 January  2015  addresses  the  documents
    that were submitted with the application made on 18 December 2013, i.e.
    a full year prior to the actual decision.


8.   The findings of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in  respect  of  the
    Immigration Rules identify  that  in  general  terms  the  sponsor  was
    earning at a rate consistent with the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules, but that her income dipped in the months of July and August 2013
    because she took time off work in order to be delivered of  twins.   It
    is a startling feature of this case that the time taken off work was no
    more than three weeks, and the sponsor has commented today that one  of
    the reasons for this was that she was conscious of the need to try  and
    ensure that she could meet the financial requirements in  order  to  be
    able to sponsor her husband.


9.   It may well be the case - and I say this  in  circumstances  where  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge does not appear to have been attuned to  this
    issue or otherwise to have  taken  it  into  account  -  that  had  the
    earnings up to the date of decision been examined the  Appellant  would
    have  had  little  difficulty  in  meeting  the  requirements  of   the
    Immigration Rules by reference to his wife's employment.   Indeed,  the
    sponsor has confirmed today that after returning to work following  her
    confinement with her twins she continued in the same  employment  until
    March 2014 whereupon she switched  without  any  gaps  to  better  paid
    employment with a different employer. In other words, if the  Appellant
    had been put on notice that a new decision was to be  made  in  January
    2015 and given the opportunity to submit up-to-date financial evidence,
    such evidence would likely have met both  the  evidential  requirements
    and the quantum requirements of the Rules.


10.  Be that as it may, the First-tier Tribunal Judge considered  the  case,
    directing herself to the relevant  Immigration  Rules  and  -  for  the
    reasons already hinted at in what I have  said  above  -  came  to  the
    conclusion that because of the drop in income in July and  August  2013
    the  Appellant  was  not  able  to  demonstrate  that  the  Rules  were
    satisfied.  In this context it is of course to  be  recalled  that  the
    appellate evaluation of the entry clearance application must be done by
    reference  to  the  circumstances  pertaining  at  the  date   of   the
    Respondent's decision,  and  also  insofar  as  there  were  evidential
    requirements there are also limitations on the acceptance into evidence
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  materials  that  post-date   the
    Appellant's application.


11.  It is moot perhaps as to whether  or  not  that  principle  applies  in
    circumstances where, as here, the initial refusal  expressly  indicated
    that further documents  might  be  taken  into  account  if  it  became
    necessary to look at the financial requirements  of  the  Rules  again.
    Those matters are in  any  event  pertinent  to,  and  relevant  to,  a
    consideration of the case under Article 8.


12.  The Judge having found against  the  Appellant  under  the  Immigration
    Rules went on to consider Article 8 from paragraph 28  onwards  of  the
    decision.  The Judge indicated that  it  was  appropriate  to  consider
    Article 8 because of the circumstances surrounding the drop  in  income
    in these terms:

         "Most importantly the only reason the sponsor was  unable  to  meet
         the financial threshold was because her wages were reduced in  July
         and August 2013 because she took three weeks off when she  had  her
         twins. The Immigration Rules do not  provide  for  any  flexibility
         over the financial threshold for such exceptional circumstances."


13.  When I first read that passage my initial reaction was that  there  was
    not anything particularly exceptional about being a working  woman  who
    takes leave  from  work  because  of  a  pregnancy  or  a  confinement.
    However,  on  reflection  it  seems  to  me  what  is  contemplated  as
    exceptional is that the time taken off was so very brief.  Having  said
    that I recognise that there is no particular test of exceptionality  to
    which it is necessary for me to have regard.


14.  Be that as it may, the judge went on  to  consider  Article  8  and  at
    paragraphs 30 to 32 deals with the first four Razgar  questions  in  an
    uncontroversial manner. The fifth Razgar question -  proportionality  -
    is then addressed at paragraphs  34  to  36  in  the  following  terms,
    bearing in mind what has already been said by the Judge at paragraph 29
    (quoted above):

         "34. The sponsor was working in a  permanent  job  which  paid  her
             �18,684 per annum and this is above  the  required  threshold.
             The only reason the sponsor was not able  to  demonstrate  the
             required level of funds in the 6 month  period  prior  to  the
             application being submitted  was  because  she  took  a  short
             period of time off work immediately before  and  after  having
             her twin  babies.   This  reduces  the  weight  that  I  would
             otherwise attach to Section 117B(3) because had she not  taken
             the time off following  childbirth  she  would  have  met  the
             threshold  set  by  the   State   to   meet   the   'financial
             independence' criteria.


         35.  The sponsor has 3 young children and is having to  bring  them
             up alone in the UK as well as working full time. They are  all
             British citizens and it is in their best interests for them to
             be brought up by both parents. I am unable to agree  with  the
             ECM that it can be considered reasonable for children who  are
             British citizens to be required  to  leave  their  country  of
             nationality and birth and all the advantages  that  living  in
             the UK  bring  them,  to  live  abroad  in  order  to  have  a
             relationship with their father at this important time in their
             lives.

         36.  Taking into account  all  the  above  and  in  particular  the
             reasons  for  the  sponsor's  reduced  income  in  August  and
             September 2013 and the best interests of  the  children  which
             are a primary consideration [ZH  (Tanzania)]  I  am  satisfied
             that the decision to refuse the appellant entry clearance as a
             partner constitutes a disproportionate interference  with  the
             family life of the appellant, sponsor and the 3 children."
15.  The basis of the Judge's decision, it seems to me, is clear  enough  on
    its face.  The Judge considered that there was a significant  level  of
    earnings being brought into the household by the sponsor;  family  life
    existed; British citizen children were involved;  the  public  interest
    considerations were met to a certain extent by reason of the  sponsor's
    financial circumstances; and on overall balance -  including  the  best
    interests of the children - refusal of entry  clearance  constituted  a
    disproportionate interference  with  the  mutual  family  life  of  the
    Appellant, his wife and their children.


16.  The Respondent sought permission to appeal to this Tribunal  which  was
    granted on 22 September 2015 by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Page.    The
    Respondent's grounds initially are set out on the basis of a  'reasons'
    challenge and it is pleaded that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  failed
    to  provide  adequate  reasons  for  his   findings   in   respect   of
    proportionality.  The grounds otherwise make  reference  to  applicable
    case law, suggest that there is inadequate reasoning in respect of  the
    issue of exceptional circumstances, and the Judge  failed  properly  to
    consider that family life might continue through visits.   It  is  also
    pleaded that the Judge had failed properly to consider  the  importance
    of the maintenance of effective immigration control  and  the  economic
    wellbeing of the UK.


17.  Ms Everett relies upon those grounds, but accepts  that  the  reasoning
    of the Judge is itself intelligible: it is not her contention  that  it
    is anything other than clear as to  the  basis  upon  which  the  Judge
    considered the appeal should be allowed.  Rather it is  submitted  that
    the reasons identified by the Judge were not sufficient to warrant  the
    outcome of the appeal, and in this context  Ms  Everett  suggests  that
    there is an appearance of the Judge applying  an  impermissible  'near-
    miss' approach, in particular with reference to the  income.


18.  During the course of submissions Ms  Everett  at  one  point  suggested
    that the proper remedy for the  Appellant  having  been  refused  entry
    clearance would have been to reapply at a point at  which  the  sponsor
    had resumed work  for  a  six  month  period  such  that  the  required
    supporting evidence of six months'  income  meeting  or  exceeding  the
    threshold under the Rules could then be provided.


19.  It was  at  that  juncture  in  the  submission  that  we  as  it  were
    collectively fell upon  the  circumstance  of  the  delay  between  the
    application and the decision, and the further delay between the initial
    decision and the second  decision.   In  that  period  necessarily  the
    sponsor would have hit a point where she had been consistently  earning
    for more than six months after the period of the drop in her  earnings,
    such that she would have met the requirement of  the  Rules.   Ms  Azam
    herself made the observation that in circumstances  where  her  husband
    had an  outstanding  application  and  in  due  course  an  appeal  the
    possibility of 'throwing that away' to start a new application did  not
    seem to be a very obvious or sensible  option  either  to  her  or  the
    Appellant.


20.  On balance, in my judgement the  reasons  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge are just about adequate.  It seems to me that  the  challenge  of
    the Respondent is primarily one of disagreement  with  the  outcome  of
    this appeal.  In any event, if it were otherwise I would not be  minded
    now to interfere with the overall conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge for the reason explored above -  by  the  date  of  each  of  the
    Respondent's decisions the sponsor would have been earning at  a  level
    that would meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules,  and  there
    was ultimately no other  matter  that  was  held  against  her  or  the
    Appellant in the application.


21.   Necessarily  the  Appellant  could  not  have  succeeded   under   the
    Immigration Rules on appeal because of the evidential  requirements  in
    that regard. However it seems to me that when  looking  at  a  decision
    allowed on the basis of Article 8 it would be unrealistic  and  frankly
    wrong now to deprive the Appellant, the sponsor and their  children  of
    the benefit of that decision, in circumstances where on the face of  it
    at the time of both decisions they were  in  a  position  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules  and  in  particular  as  I  have
    observed previously there does not  seem  to  have  been   any  obvious
    indication or warning that the  second  decision  would  be  taken  and
    therefore no invitation or opportunity to submit  up-to-date  financial
    evidence in that regard.
