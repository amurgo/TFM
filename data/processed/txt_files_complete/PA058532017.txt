For the Appellants:    Mr Spurling, Counsel instructed by S.Satha & Co
                       Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz,   Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Sri Lanka born in 1988. He appeals  with
    permission the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge NMK Lawrence)
    to  dismiss  his  appeal  on  protection  and  human  rights   grounds.
    Permission to appeal to this tribunal was granted on the 27th  November
    2018 by First-tier Tribunal Grant-Hutchinson.

 2. The protection claim advanced before the First-tier Tribunal  was  that
    the Appellant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Sri  Lanka  for
    reasons of his political opinion and his Tamil ethnicity. In  terms  of
    the facts, there were two limbs to the Appellant's case. First that  he
    had a history of political involvement,  and  persecution  for  reasons
    thereof, in Sri Lanka. This included association with the LTTE, lengthy
    detentions and ill-treatment. This  history  of  involvement  with  the
    Tamil separatist cause in Sri Lanka begins in 2002  and  ends  in  2016
    with an assault by members of the security services.  The  second  limb
    was that the Appellant has, since his arrival in the United Kingdom  in
    2016, been actively involved with the 'Transitional Government of Tamil
    Eelam' (TGTE), that is to say the primary political grouping  operating
    in the Tamil diaspora in the United Kingdom. This sur  place  activity,
    it was submitted,  served  to  enforce  and  validate  the  Appellant's
    account of long-term political activism, but it also  gave  rise  to  a
    discrete risk even if the historical account narrated  under  limb  one
    was rejected.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal rejected the evidence going to the first  limb.
    It found the Appellant's account to contain material discrepancies  and
    omissions, such as his inability to recall dates and names  when  first
    asked. His claim to have been tortured was not credible given  that  he
    had no physical injuries or scars: "it defies  physiology"  [�22].   It
    was "simply not credible" that he did not know the amount paid  by  his
    uncle to secure his release from detention [�23].   Where  his  account
    was consistent with country background evidence  this  was  immaterial,
    since information such as the names of detention camps is in the public
    domain [�26].  A letter produced from the Appellant's  father  attracts
    no weight because it is "self-serving"  [�28].   Overall  the  Tribunal
    concludes that the account of events in Sri Lanka was a fabrication.

 4. In respect of the second limb the  Tribunal  notes  -  and  appears  to
    accept  -  the  Appellant's  evidence  that  he  has  taken   part   in
    demonstrations in the United Kingdom including an event outside the Sri
    Lankan High Commission in London where a Brigadier of  the  Sri  Lankan
    Army was observed to make a "throat cutting" gesture at the protesters.
      The  Tribunal  notes  however  that  scores  of  people  attend  such
    demonstrations, and the  Appellant  has  failed  to  provide  a  cogent
    explanation as to why it would be likely that he  would  be  identified
    from the images gathered by spies.




    The Grounds of Challenge

 5. The Appellant submits that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    flawed in the following material respects:

          i) The credibility findings made in  respect  of  the  historical
             account are unreasoned and unsafe. In particular


               a) The determination contains a complaint about  the  conduct
                  of the Appellant's solicitors which is unfounded and could
                  reasonably give rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias  on
                  the part of the Judge, the Appellant  perceiving  that  he
                  may not have received a fair hearing;


               b) The  Tribunal's  conclusion  that  the  lack  of  scarring
                  "defies physiology" was not one open to a Tribunal with no
                  medical expertise;


               c) The evidence of the Appellant's father  cannot  rationally
                  be dismissed simply on  the  grounds  that  it  is  "self-
                  serving";


               d) The determination fails to mention the evidence  that  the
                  Appellant  had   been   referred   for   counselling.   In
                  circumstances  where  his  mental   health   issues   were
                  attributed to his history of persecution this amounted  to
                  a failure to  take  material  evidence  into  account  and
                  assess all relevant matters in the round;


               e) Further the Tribunal failed, in this regard, to treat  the
                  Appellant as a vulnerable witness;


               f) The determination contains errors of fact;


               g) The risk assessment  contains  no  findings  on  the  2016
                  incident which is claimed to have led to  the  Appellant's
                  departure from Sri Lanka.


         ii) The analysis in respect of the sur place activity is  confined
             to   consideration   of   the   Appellant's   attendance    at
             demonstrations in London. No consideration was  given  to  the
             unchallenged evidence that he is  a  member  of  the  TGTE  (a
             membership card was produced at hearing), a matter which  read
             with the country guidance material was capable  in  itself  of
             giving rise to a real risk of  harm:  see  UB  (Sri  Lanka)  v
             Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 85.





    Discussion and Findings

 6. I am unable to find any evidence of bias, or closed-mindedness, on  the
    part of the Judge. At  paragraph  3  of  its  decision  the  First-tier
    Tribunal criticises the Appellant's former representatives for the  way
    in which an earlier adjournment application was drafted.  The  Tribunal
    clearly took a dim view of that  application  and  comments  that  this
    "discrete matter should be  referred  to  the  Resident  Judge".  Quite
    whether the Tribunal itself made such a referral is unclear,  but  what
    is apparent is that it regarded the  matter  as  an  entirely  separate
    issue from the merits of the appeal before it: hence  the  use  of  the
    word  "discrete".  Mr  Spurling  submitted  that  the  nature  of   the
    credibility findings overall were indicative of  a  Tribunal  that  had
    "closed its mind" to the possibility that the Appellant was telling the
    truth.  He invited me to read paragraph 3 of the determination, and the
    grounds critiquing it, in that context.  I am  unable  to  accept  that
    this raises even an arguable case of  bias.   The  fact  that  a  Judge
    reaches negative credibility conclusions about a witness before him  is
    not a basis upon which to  challenge  that  Judge's  impartiality.   It
    would  obviously  make  a  nonsense  of  the  appellate  structure   if
    determinations could be  set  aside  because  they  contained  negative
    credibility assessments. There is nothing in the materials before me to
    indicate that there was any bias here.

 7. I would  add  that  at  paragraph  24  of  its  decision  the  Tribunal
    interpolates the following comment, when describing events outside  the
    Sri Lankan High Commission in February 2018 when the Brigadier made his
    "throat-cutting"  gesture:  "the  impunity  with  which  the  Brigadier
    publicly made the gesture confirms, if needed, war crimes,  and  crimes
    against humanity, were committed by the Singhalese  government  against
    the Tamils of Sri Lanka".   That is hardly the comment  of  a  Tribunal
    that has 'closed its mind' to the possibility that the events described
    in this claim are true.

 8. That said, I am quite satisfied that this  determination  must  be  set
    aside for the following reasons:

          i) The Tribunal  does  not  engage  with  the  substance  of  the
             Appellant's submissions in respect of the second limb  of  his
             case. It is the unchallenged evidence that the Appellant is  a
             member of the TGTE. The relevance of that was that if he  were
             to be returned to Sri Lanka he would likely be asked questions
             about whether he had participated in political  activities  in
             the diaspora (paragraph 308 of GJ & Ors Sri  Lanka  CG  [2013]
             UKUT  319  (IAC)  refers);  applying  the  principles  in   RT
             (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012]
             UKSC 38 he could not be expected to lie, and since the TGTE is
             a proscribed terrorist organisation in Sri Lanka he  would  be
             reasonably likely to  face  serious  harm  as  a  result.  The
             determination does not address any of that; it confines itself
             to considering whether the Appellant would  be  recognised  by
             government  spies  watching  demonstrators  outside  the  High
             Commission.  That omission is a material error of law.


         ii) No findings of fact are made in respect of the  2016  incident
             which allegedly caused the Appellant to flee Sri  Lanka.  That
             omission is a material error of law.


        iii) The Appellant had relied on a letter from the Bishop of Jaffna
             who personally attested that he has known the Appellant  since
             birth, known him to have had association  with  the  LTTE  and
             drawn the adverse attention of  the  security  services  as  a
             result.  That  letter,  potentially  important   corroborative
             evidence, is nowhere acknowledged or assessed. That failure to
             take evidence into account amounts to a material error of law.




         iv) The letter from the Appellant's father is given no  weight  at
             all on the grounds that it is "self-serving". That  is  not  a
             rational basis upon which to reject evidence, since  most,  if
             not all, evidence adduced by a party will be "self-serving":


          v) The Appellant's bundle contained evidence  demonstrating  that
             he  had  been  referred,  by  the  Medical   Foundation,   for
             counselling. That evidence was relied upon as  lending  weight
             to the Appellant's claims to have experienced ill-treatment in
             Sri Lanka, and to some degree in response to criticisms of his
             evidence (for instance regarding his inability to  immediately
             recall, when asked, the details of events that took  place  in
             2006). That evidence is  not  weighed  in  the  balance.  That
             failure to take evidence into account amounts  to  a  material
             error of law.


         vi) The Tribunal was not  medically  qualified  and  as  such  its
             comments that the Appellant's lack of external injury  "defied
             physiology" were not rationally  open  to  it  (the  Appellant
             claimed to have been kicked and beaten in 2006 but not to have
             received medical attention  afterwards  because  his  injuries
             were internal pains rather than external wounds).


 9. I note for the sake of completeness that Mr Diwnycz made no submissions
    in defence of the determination.  Both parties  agreed  that  the  most
    appropriate disposal, in light of the extent of judicial  fact  finding
    required, would be remittal to a judge of the First-tier Tribunal other
    than NMK Lawrence. I agree.




    Anonymity

10. This appeal concerns a claim made under the Refugee Convention.  Having
    had regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity  Orders
    I therefore consider it appropriate to make an order in  the  following
    terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


    Decisions

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

12. The hearing is to be re-heard de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.

13. There is a direction for anonymity.
