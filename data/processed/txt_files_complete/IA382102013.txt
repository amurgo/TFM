For the Appellant: Mr G. Saunders, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: No appearance and not represented


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of State.  However,
    for convenience I refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 2. This appeal comes before me following an earlier hearing  on  13  March
    2014.  That hearing was in respect of an appeal  by  the  Secretary  of
    State against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  allowed
    this appellant's appeal against a refusal to vary her leave to  remain.
    She sought further leave to remain as a Tier  4  Student  Migrant.   At
    that hearing I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal on the
    basis of error of law for the reasons that appear in the error  of  law
    decision which is attached as an annex to this judgment.

 3. The application to vary leave to remain was refused by the Secretary of
    State solely in  respect  of  maintenance.   The  appellant  needed  to
    provide evidence of funds amounting to ï¿½7,200 which she did not  do  by
    reference to evidence  that  complied  with  the  relevant  Immigration
    Rules.  Simply put, the error of law by the First-tier Tribunal was  to
    take into account post-decision evidence which the judge was prohibited
    from doing by virtue of Section 85A(4) of the Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.  The appeal under the Immigration  Rules  was  not
    formally dismissed at that hearing but I indicated in the decision that
    that was going to be the outcome.

 4. I should say that having reviewed the judgment that I gave  in  respect
    of the error of law issue, I neglected to deal with a  submission  that
    was made in terms of evidential flexibility.   It  was  suggested  that
    evidential flexibility applied to the appellant's application under the
    Immigration Rules whereby the Secretary of  State  should  have  sought
    further information  from  the  appellant  and  allow  her  to  provide
    evidence of funds held in  some  bank.   I  was  not  referred  to  any
    evidential flexibility policy, if there was one, that is said  to  have
    been in existence, and I was not referred to  paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Immigration Rules which now governs evidential flexibility contained in
    the Immigration Rules.  It may be that there  is  a  policy  that  runs
    alongside this aspect of the Rules but I was not referred  to  it.   In
    any event I cannot see that any application of  evidential  flexibility
    could have saved the application under the Immigration Rules.  This was
    not a case where there was a missing document or a document in a series
    that was missing. Evidential flexibility plainly had no part to play in
    the decision by the Secretary of State.

 5. I indicated at the last hearing that the outcome of  the  challenge  to
    the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  was  that  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules under the Immigration  Rules  was  to  be  dismissed.
    Having set aside that aspect of the decision, I re-make the decision by
    dismissing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 6. This hearing is to consider Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.

 7. Again, as indicated in the error of law decision,  Article  8  was  not
    expressly referred to in the grounds of appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal but it seemed to me that it would be  appropriate  for  me  to
    allow the grounds to be amended to include Article 8, bearing  in  mind
    that the appellant herself completed the  initial  grounds  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 8. On 13 March 2004 I  gave  a  direction  to  the  parties,  subsequently
    confirmed in writing, that no later than 14 days from the date  of  the
    written  judgment,  27  March   2014,   the   appellant   through   her
    representatives must file and serve all evidence relied on  in  support
    of the new, Article 8, ground of appeal.

 9. What has been provided is a witness statement from the appellant  dated
    11 June 2014.  It states, in summary, that  the  decision  is  unlawful
    because it is incompatible with her European Convention rights.  It  is
    said that she is a  genuine  student  who  came  to  the  UK  with  the
    intention to get a higher education.   She  has  invested  considerable
    time and money in her studies,  is  hard-working  and  is  a  dedicated
    student.  She states she  has  regularly  attended  classes  since  her
    arrival and has always complied with the  conditions  attached  to  the
    visa.  She goes on to state that if she is unable to continue to fulfil
    her ambition at this stage it will be unjust and will  deprive  her  of
    "my basic right of education".  The statement continues  that  she  has
    already established private life by engaging myself  into  studies  and
    has enough funds to finance those studies.  She also  states  that  she
    will be able to accommodate herself and complete  her  studies  without
    recourse to public funds.

10. Along with that statement was a letter from her  representatives  dated
    11 June 2014 asking that the appeal "be heard on papers rather  than  a
    normal hearing".  That request was repeated in a letter dated  16  June
    2014.  I do not think that the Secretary of State was informed  by  the
    appellant's representatives of that request. Even if she was, I do  not
    consider it appropriate to deal with this case purely on the  basis  of
    the documents before me, that is without a hearing.  The  Secretary  of
    State has attended today and through Mr Saunders  is,  and  was,  in  a
    position to make submissions in relation to the issues before  me.  For
    those reasons I considered that it was appropriate  to  proceed  to  an
    oral hearing. The appellant has decided that she did not want to attend
    a hearing and thus, there is no prejudice to her  in  proceeding  to  a
    hearing in her absence.

11. Mr Saunders' submissions were to the effect that the only contention in
    relation to  the  Article  8  argument  is  contained  in  the  witness
    statement whereby the appellant goes no further than stating  that  she
    wants to complete her studies in the UK.  He submitted that  there  was
    nothing to take her case beyond the confines of Article 8 as set out in
    the Immigration Rules and he asked me to dismiss the appeal.

12. Given that the  appeal  is  to  be  determined  on  classic  Article  8
    principles I apply the principles established in  Razgar  [2004],  UKHL
    27.  The appellant arrived in the UK in 2009 as a student and has  been
    studying ever since.  I am prepared to accept that she has  established
    a private life here but the extent of that  private  life  is  hard  to
    gauge without any evidence of it beyond that of her  studies.   On  the
    assumption that she has established a  private  life  in  the  UK,  the
    decision of the respondent here would amount to  an  interference  with
    that private life, that interference for present purposes could be said
    to have consequences of such  gravity  as  potentially  to  engage  the
    operation of Article 8, applying the second principle in  Razgar.   The
    decision is in accordance with the law and it pursues a legitimate aim.
     The only question remaining is that of proportionality, assuming  that
    stage is reached.

13. As I have already indicated, there is nothing in the evidence before me
    in relation to the appellant's private life  except  the  fact  of  her
    studies.  The course she sought further leave to remain in  respect  of
    was a Postgraduate Diploma in Information Systems, the course  starting
    on 15 July 2013 and ending on 31 July 2014.  It may well  be  that  the
    appellant has spent a sum of money, maybe even a  considerable  sum  of
    money, on her education and I accept that she wishes  to  complete  the
    course and that she has been a diligent student who has  complied  with
    the Rules in every respect in terms of the Immigration  Rules.   It  is
    however, misconceived of the appellant to claim that she has a right to
    education in the UK. She does not.

14. In relation to the assessment of proportionality, I bear  in  mind  the
    decision in Nasim & Others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC).   There
    the Upper Tribunal said that:

         "The judgments of the Supreme Court in Patel & Others  v  Secretary
         of State [2013] UKSC 72 serve to re-focus attention on  the  nature
         and purpose of Article  8  of  the  ECHR  and,  in  particular,  to
         recognise that Article 8 limited utility  and  private  life  cases
         that are far removed from the protection of an  individual's  moral
         and physical integrity."

    It goes on to state that:

         "A person's  human  rights  are  not  enhanced  by  not  committing
         criminal offences  or  not  relying  on  public  funds.   The  only
         significance of  such  matters  in  cases  concerning  proposed  or
         hypothetical removal from the United Kingdom  is  to  preclude  the
         Secretary of State from pointing to any public interest  justifying
         removal, over and above the basic importance of maintaining a  firm
         and coherent system of immigration control."

15. In this case I am unable to see that the  appellant  has  any  arguable
    case at all in relation to  Article  8  in  terms  of  proportionality.
    Whilst I accept that the evidence, had she submitted it in proper form,
    may have been able to show that she had sufficient funds  to  meet  the
    costs of the course and her maintenance, the is she did  not  establish
    that she was able to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  by
    evidencing  those  funds  at  the  relevant  time;  the  time  of   the
    application.  It is recognised that there may be harsh consequences for
    some individuals who have been unable to meet the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State is entitled  to
    promote and maintain a consistent and predictable system of immigration
    control that applies to  all  applicants.   I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Secretary of State has established that the decision to refuse to  vary
    the appellant's leave to remain is  a  proportionate  response  to  the
    legitimate aim pursued.

16. In those circumstances, the appeal in relation to Article 8  must  also
    be dismissed, as with the appeal in terms of the Immigration Rules.

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside
    and the appeal is dismissed  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.
