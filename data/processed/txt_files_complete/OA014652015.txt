Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Doerfel, Counsel, instructed by International
Care Network
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Zimbabwe, has  permission  to  challenge  a
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  A D Baker sent on 27 April 2016,
    dismissing her  appeal  against  a  decision  made  by  the  respondent
    refusing her entry clearance  on  human  rights  grounds  to  join  her
    mother, a refugee, and family in the UK. under Article 8 ECHR when  she
    was aged 21 years and 7 months old.

2.   In dismissing the  appeal  the  judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had
    conceded she could not succeed under paragraph A280.  As  regards  para
    319(V) (the rule for dependent relatives of a refugee), the judge found
    that she could not consider this as the  appellant  had  not  paid  the
    requisite fee and in any event there was "no evidence advanced to cause
    me to find that at the date of the refusal decision the appellant could
    have met, nor that she does so at the date of hearing  of  her  appeal,
    the requirements if para 319(V)" (paras 65 and 61).  She further  found
    that the appellant  could not meet the requirements  of paragraph  317,
    as her living conditions, even when considered  cumulatively  with  the
    impact on her of denial of close contact with her family members in the
    UK, were insufficient to meet the  requirements of this rule (para 63).



3.   The judge also concluded that the appellant  could  not  bring  herself
    within the rules governing Article 8 in  the  context  of  a  dependent
    relative - Appendix FM  Section E-EC-DR, by virtue of the fact that she
    was adult child over the age of 18 without any  illness  or  disability
    requiring long term personal care to perform everyday tasks (para 63).

4.   The judge  then  considered  whether  the  appellant  was  entitled  to
    succeed on human rights  grounds.   She  first  of  all  addressed  the
    appellant's contention that she had been treated unfairly  because  the
    delay in the respondent dealing with her mothers'  asylum  claim,  more
    than  ten years (2002 - December 2012) had  meant  she  was  unable  to
    enter the  UK under the refugee family reunion policy  rules  whilst  a
    minor. Her reasons for rejecting this contention were set out  at  para
    64.

         "It is clear from the evidence I find as to the historical position
         that the appellant  was unable to  satisfy  the  earlier  Rules  in
         force prior to 2012, after her father  obtained  ILR,  as  a  adult
         dependant child, her circumstances from the evidence before  me  of
         living with the extended family who brought her up, in safe  secure
         conditions, she could not then have satisfied the requirements   as
         to her circumstances or of living alone and did not do so either at
         the date of decision in respect of para 319(V).  I consider this as
         possibly relevant to  the  appellant's  arguments  to  support  her
         claims for historic injustice  to  the  appellant  by  the  claimed
         responsibility of  the  respondent  for  the  ten  years'  time  of
         processing the appellant's mother's asylum application. Further and
         critically, the appellant had not made  any  such  application.  As
         evidenced from the appellant's representative's correspondence, the
         appropriate  fee  for  the  application  actually  made  had   been
         discharged and she not paid the fee necessary for  the  application
         possibly open to the  appellant  under  the  [rules]  as  an  adult
         dependant relative.'

5.   Having decided that there was no substance to  the  assertion  that  in
    Pretoria an ECO had dealt with a case having  a similar factual  matrix
    differently and having decided that there was nothing to indicate  that
    the respondent was bound by a policy beneficial to the  appellant,  the
    judge then addressed Article 8 at para 67:

         "I consider her Article 8 ECHR rights in the context of  Razgar  as
         informed by s.117 [NIAA 2002] above, bringing forward  my  findings
         above on those stipulated factors and all other facts I have found.
         The appellant is an adult.  She does not enjoy family life with her
         mother, father and siblings, applying Kugathas, as a  young  adult.
         Applying the findings, above the appellant has not demonstrated the
         relationship between her and  her  family  in  the  United  Kingdom
         consists of  'family life' as used in the context of  the  European
         Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, Article 8.   Rather,
         I find that this is private life, the parents and she having  lived
         apart for years, physical contact by  occasional  visits  from  her
         father and maintenance of  context  by  frequent  telephone  calls,
         other media also, between her and her family and sending her  money
         to support her living in Zimbabwe.  In any event that  relationship
         is an important element of their private life. As such I give those
         relationships between her and family  members  considerable  weight
         akin to that to be given to enjoyment of family life.  However,  on
         my findings above as to the situation at the date of  decision  and
         the situation at  the  date  of  the  hearing  that  enjoyment  can
         continue uninterrupted. The refusal of  entry  clearance  does  not
         engage the appellant's Article 8 rights."

6.   The grounds of  appeal  concluded  that  the  judge  fell  into  error,
    firstly by portraying the appellant's application based on Article 8 as
    an "attempt[ed] in effect,  to  circumvent  the  Immigration  Rules  by
    seeking consideration of her ECHR rights", by stating that  it was open
    to the appellant to pay the relevant fee and apply  under  Appendix  FM
    para 319(V), by finding that  she  had  not  done  so  for  reasons  of
    expedience only and also in stating that para 352D was  "no  longer  in
    force at the date of application" (para 38).  Secondly, the  judge  was
    said to  have erred in failing to recognise that the ties  between  the
    appellant and her siblings were patently family life, not private  life
    and then  in considering that her Article 8(1) rights were not  engaged
    (para 67); and  in  failing  to  carry  out  a  proper  proportionality
    assessment.  In the appellant's grounds of appeal and submission before
    me, particular emphasis was placed on the reasons behind the separation
    of the appellant's family in the first  place.  Mr  Doerfel  emphasised
    that refugee cases cannot be placed on a par with  cases  of  voluntary
    migration, as cited in this regard the ECHR case of Toquabe -  Tekle  &
    Others v Netherlands [2005] ECtHR 803.  In this context the  judge  was
    said to have failed to take account of the excessive delay on the  part
    of the respondent in dealing with the mother's asylum claim - nearly 10
    ï¿½ years.  There were eight years and nine months of delay during  which
    the appellant was still a minor.

7.   Thirdly (encompassing grounds 3 and 4), the grounds submitted that  the
    judge failed to take into account the factors set out  in  s.117A-D  of
    the NIAA 2002 relating to the appellant's ability to speak English  and
    to be financially independent. The judge was said  to  have  failed  to
    take into account that the appellant speaks excellent  English  and  is
    fully supported by both  parents,  as  well  as  now  being  intent  on
    entering a shortage occupation in the UK to train as a nurse.

8.   In oral submissions Mr Duerful  emphasised  the  fact  that  after  her
    mother left Zimbabwe in 2002, the appellant then aged 9 was  in  charge
    of looking after three of her siblings as a surrogate mother.  Had  the
    mother's application been dealt with earlier the appellant  could  have
    been granted refugee family reunion, like her  sister  Mercy,  who  had
    applied in 2013 and had been granted leave under  para  352D.  As  ties
    with her siblings clearly went beyond normal emotional ties. the  judge
    was wrong to say there was no legitimate expectation that the appellant
    would have acquired refugee family reunion leave, but even if that  was
    not so, the delay substantially affected the right to be given  to  the
    public interest.

9.   As regards ground 1, I see no error  of  any  substance  in  the  judge
    making reference to the appellant seeking to circumvent  the  rules  by
    reference to Article 8  as  there  is  nothing  to  suggest  that  this
    negative comment affected her actual  reasoning.  Similarly  I  see  no
    consequence of any  significance  arising  from  the  judge's  mistaken
    suggestion that it was open to the appellant to pay  the  relevant  fee
    for a para 319 (V) application, when that provision was  no  longer  in
    force.

10.  Taken in isolation, I would not find  ground  2  to  identify  a  clear
    error of law, because even  though  it  is  strongly  arguable  on  the
    judge's own findings of fact that the  appellant  enjoyed  family  life
    ties with her siblings, if not her mother also (who was  continuing  to
    support her financially and take a close interest in her  education  ),
    the judge did accept that she had private life ties  which  encompassed
    her family relationships and gave them weight  "akin"  to  family  life
    ties  (para  67).  Further,  her  assessment  of  the  issue   of   the
    proportionality of the interference with the appellant's  private  life
    posed by the decision did at least seek to  build  on  by  her  earlier
    findings that the appellant was an educated young  woman  now  aged  21
    with no health problems and with continuing support from members of her
    mother's family in Zimbabwe (paras 57 and 62).

11.   However, the judge's proportionality assessment was plainly flawed  by
    her failure to factor in the very substantial period of  delay  in  the
    processing of her  mother's  asylum  claim.   The  judge  was  strictly
    correct to say that there was no legitimate expectation that the asylum
    claim of her mother would be addressed or granted whilst the  appellant
    was still in her  minority,  but  the  delay  did  result  in  historic
    injustice to  the  appellant  since,  if  her  asylum  claim  had  been
    processed in less than eight years, the appellant would then have  been
    entitled to come to the UK under the refugee/family reunion policy.

12.  The judge appeared to consider this missed opportunity had no  material
    impact on the appellant's situation because  "[s]he  was  able  in  any
    event since her father was granted  ILR in  2010  to  apply  under  the
    rules to join him as a dependant relative, his  adult  child"  (63  and
    64).    The judge 's reasoning here is quite  obscure,  since  (i)  the
    appellant's  complaint  was  that  she  had  been   denied  making   an
    application under refugee family reunion policy whilst still  a  minor;
    (ii) the requirements  under the refugee  family  reunion  policy  were
    easier to satisfy at the  relevant   time   than  those  for  dependent
    children of a parent with ILR; (iii) until the appellant's mother   was
    eventually  granted  refugee  status  in  2012,  there  was  simply  no
    possibility of applying or paying a fee for the category  of  dependent
    child of a refugee.

13.  As regards the over 10 year period of delay in processing the  mother's
    asylum claim (over 8 years during the period the appellant was still  a
    minor), it was a period of delay well beyond one  that  was  reasonable
    and Mr Duerfel is quite right to cite the several authorities that make
    clear that ordinarily a period over eight years is beyond the limits of
    reasonable delay.  The  judge  also  failed  to  factor  in  two  other
    elements of the delay in this case. It was delay in deciding whether  a
    person is a refugee.  Recognition  of  a  person  as  a  refugee  is  a
    declaratory act, not a constitutive act so  that,  other  things  being
    equal, the appellant's mother was a refugee  when  she  left  Zimbabwe.
    Second, unlike the situation of a  parent  who  comes  to  the  UK  for
    immigration reasons, a person who flees her country owing  to  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution cannot be considered to have made a  choice
    to separate from her family. This is a valid point made by  Mr  Duerfel
    with reference to the Strasbourg judgment in Tuquabo-Tekle &  Others  v
    Netherlands. These two aspects aggravated the effect of  the  delay  on
    the appellant's family life ties with her mother when she was a minor.

15.  For the above reasons I conclude that the FtT  judge  materially  erred
    in law.

16.  I consider I am in a  position  to  re-make  the  decision  for  myself
    without further ado. Since  the  decision  under  appeal  is  an  entry
    clearance decision I must consider the evidence as it stood at the date
    of decision (16 December  20124).   I  am  entirely  satisfied,  taking
    account of the evidence as a whole, that the decision under appeal  was
    a disproportionate interference with the appellant's right  to  respect
    for private and family life since had it not been for the  unreasonable
    and excessive delay on the part of the respondent  in  recognising  the
    appellant's mother as a refugee, she would have had  a  straightforward
    route to entry clearance as the dependent child of a refugee - just  as
    straightforward as the route by which  her  two  younger  brothers  and
    older sister succeeded in 2013.There were compelling  reasons  why  the
    ECO at the date of decision should  have  granted  entry  clearance  in
    light of the appellant's Article 8 circumstances.

17.  For the above reasons:

    The FtT judge materially erred in law and her decision is set aside and
    the decision I substitute is to allow the appellant's appeal on Article
    8 grounds.




Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
