For the Appellant:     Ms J Norman, Counsel instructed by Westkin
Associates, London
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senor Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Iran whose date of birth is  recorded  as
    15 July 1991.  On 29 September 2014 he made a combined application  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  and  for  a  biometric
    residence permit.  On 6 November 2014 a decision was made to refuse the
    application and to remove him by way of  directions  having  regard  to
    Sections 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The refusal was made having regard to Paragraph 245ZX(d) of  HC395  (as
    amended).  In short, and there was no issue about this,  having  regard
    to Appendix C to the rules the Appellant was required to show  that  he
    was in possession of �11,480.00 for a consecutive 28 day  period  dated
    no earlier than 31 days before the date of the application.

 3. The Appellant sent with his application a letter from Bank Mellat dated
    25 September 2014 stating that his father was a customer  of  the  bank
    who maintained a current account with a balance,  as  at  the  time  of
    writing of, 603,690.284 Rials (approximately �13,740).  The same letter
    gave a total of debit and credit  entries  from  24  June  2014  to  25
    September 2014 but did  not  state  the  credit  balance  for  any  one
    particular day.

 4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. On 8  May  2015  his
    appeal was decided, "on the papers" by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    K W Brown.  Judge Brown was provided with a further document  dated  19
    November 2014 certifying that the credit  balance  of  the  account  in
    question had been 650,000,000 Rials during the "last 28  days."   Since
    the Appellant was required to show a credit balance for each of the  28
    days in the consecutive period dated no earlier than 31 days before the
    date of the application the document could  not  assist  the  Appellant
    since the letter was dated significantly later than  the  date  of  the
    application.

 5. Having regard to the evidence that was before her,  Judge  Brown  found
    that the documentary evidence was insufficient as  it  did  not  comply
    with the requirements of the rules. She therefore dismissed the appeal.



 6. Not content with the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  by  Notice
    dated 25 June 2015 the Appellant made  application  for  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The grounds submitted that the  document
    of 25 September 2014 gave the turnover of the account  though  not  the
    daily balance as required.   However,  the  Appellant  pointed  to  the
    actual wording used in the refusal in which  it  was  said  that,  "The
    document does not show clear evidence of the  balance  of  the  account
    throughout the entirety of a period of  28  consecutive  days."   Given
    that wording, the Appellant contended that the Secretary of  State  was
    accepting that there was evidence, it was just that it was not  "clear"
    and so she  should  have  applied  her  evidential  flexibility  policy
    guidance and paragraph 245AA of HC395 (as  amended).   On  8  September
    2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colyer  granted  permission  thus
    the matter comes before me.

 7. Paragraph 245AA relevant for the purposes of this  appeal  (there  have
    been subsequent amendments) provides as follows:

         "a)  Where Part 6A of any appendices referred to in Part  6A  state
             that specified documents  must  be  provided,  the  UK  Border
             Agency will only consider documents that have  been  submitted
             with  the  application,  and  will  only  consider   documents
             submitted after the application where they  are  submitted  in
             accordance with Sub Paragraph(b).

         b)   If the applicant has submitted:

             i)   A sequence of documents and some of the documents in  the
                  sequence have been  omitted  (for  example,  if  one  bank
                  statement     from a series is missing);

             ii)  A document in the wrong format; or

             iii) A document that is a copy and not an original document,

             The  UK  Border  Agency  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
             representative in writing and request the  correct  documents.
             The requested documents must be  received  by  the  UK  Border
             Agency at the address specified in the  request  within  seven
             working days of the date of the request.

         c)   The UK Border  Agency  will  not  request  documents  where  a
             specified document has not  been  submitted  (for  example  an
             English language certificate is  missing),  or  where  the  UK
             Border Agency does not anticipate that addressing the omission
             or error referred to in Sub Paragraph (d) will lead to a grant
             because the application will be refused for other reasons.

         d)   If the applicant has submitted a specified document:

             i)   In the wrong format, or

             ii)  That is a copy and not an original document,

             The application may be granted exceptionally, providing the UK
             Border Agency is satisfied that the  specified  documents  are
             genuine and the applicant meets all  the  other  requirements.
             The UK  Border  Agency  reserves  the  right  to  request  the
             specified original documents in  the  correct  format  in  all
             cases where (b) applies, and to refuse applications  if  these
             documents are not provided as set out in (b)."

 8. One of the requirements of the rule at Appendix  C  is  that  the  bank
    statement or statements must show that, "the funds in the account  have
    been at the required level throughout the specified period."

 9. Ms Norman began by accepting that the letter of 19 November 2014  could
    not be relevant to the matters under  consideration  because  it  post-
    dated the date of the application and  could  only  be  interpreted  as
    relating to the level of funds after and not before  the  date  of  the
    application.  Reliance was therefore was placed entirely on the  letter
    of the bank of 25 September 2014.

10. As to Paragraph 245AA, Ms Norman relied on "(b)(ii) and (d)."   It  was
    her submission that the document met the requirements of  the  rule  in
    that it evidenced sufficient funds over a 28 day period but was in  the
    wrong format.  She  invited  me  to  look  to  the  credit  balance  of
    603,690,284 Rials and find that even if one were to  deduct  the  debit
    balance of 4,019,087,421 it would not be possible  for  there  to  have
    been any less than the required minimum on any  one  day.   However  Ms
    Norman was obliged to abandon that point when Mr  Avery  observed  that
    she had misread the figures.   Whereas  the  credit  balance  over  the
    period of 13 May 2007 to 25 September  2014  began  with  a  figure  in
    excess of 603 million Rials the debit figure began  with  a  figure  in
    excess of 4 billion Rials.  Nevertheless Ms Norman persisted  with  her
    submission that the figures did not necessarily mean that the Appellant
    did not have the requisite amount of money on any one of the 28 days in
    question  and  further  enquiry  by  application  of   the   evidential
    flexibility would have enabled the Appellant  to  provide  evidence  to
    demonstrate that the rule was met.  She accepted that she was  not  now
    able to place before  the  tribunal  further  evidence  to  demonstrate
    whether or not in fact  had  the  evidential  flexibility  policy  been
    followed as she contended it should have been, that the Appellant would
    have had the requisite evidence because that  would  be  post  decision
    evidence and inadmissible.  Her submission was that as the  Immigration
    Judge was faced with a document which was defective only because it was
    in the wrong format, the appeal should have been allowed on  the  basis
    that the Secretary of State had not considered her  flexibility  policy
    and the matter should have been remitted.

11. In my judgment this  appeal  is  without  merit.   The  fact  that  the
    Secretary of State has used the words "clear evidence" cannot,  on  the
    facts of this case  be  interpreted  to  mean  that  the  evidence  was
    sufficient but in the wrong format. The ordinary meaning in the context
    as used was that there was no sufficient evidence. In my  judgment  the
    evidence was wholly inadequate. I refer to the case of EK (Ivory Coast)
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA  Civ  1517  in
    which Sales LJ said:

         "The points based system is intended to simplify the procedure  for
         applying for leave to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
         certain classes of case, such as economic  migrants  and  students.
         This is to enable the Secretary of State to process high volumes of
         applications in a fair and reasonably expeditious manner, according
         to clear objective criteria.  This  is  in  the  interests  of  all
         applicants.  It also assists applicants to know what evidence  they
         have to submit in support of an application."

12. In my judgment the document relied upon of 25 September 2014 is  not  a
    document in the wrong format it is a document which does  not  evidence
    that which is required.  It is clear that what is required is  evidence
    of the balance on the account for each of 28  consecutive  days.   This
    document simply evidences the balance  on  one  day  and  there  is  no
    sufficient basis, in my judgement for  looking  to  that  document  and
    saying that the Secretary of State was put on notice that  the  figures
    could not on any particular day have fallen below the minimum  required
    for the reasons Mr Avery pointed out namely that Ms Norman had  misread
    the figures.  This is not  even  an  account  which  shows  an  opening
    balance but rather simply one figure for one date.   The  Secretary  of
    State is afforded a wide discretion in 245AA(c) of the rules and in  my
    judgment there was no sufficient evidence for saying that the Secretary
    of State should have anticipated that addressing the omission  referred
    to, which in this case was not simply to  provide  a  document  in  the
    wrong format but in fact, in my judgment a wholly inadequate  document,
    addressing the omission or error, would lead to a grant.  The format of
    the documents is set out at 7(iv) of Appendix C.   That  provides  that
    statements must be either:

        "1)  Printed on the bank's or building society's letterhead,

         2)   Electronic bank or building society statements...  accompanied
             by a supporting letter from the bank or building  society,  on
             company headed paper, confirming the statement provided it  is
             authentic, or

         3)   Electronic bank or building society statements ... bearing the
             official stamp of the bank or building society on every page."

         Further at (5) the statements must  not  be  mini  statements  from
         automatic teller machines (ATMs)."

13. It is to that kind of matter  to  which  the  term  "wrong  format"  in
    245AA(d)(ii) or (d)(i) is to be considered and not as  I  have  said  a
    document which is wholly lacking in evidencing that which  is  required
    within the rule.  What has to be "clear" is that on  the  face  of  the
    evidence actually submitted any enquiry made by the Secretary of  State
    in following the evidential  flexibility  policy  under  the  rules  is
    reasonable likely to produce the evidence that is lacking. I find as  a
    fact that this was not the case here and Judge Brown was also right  to
    so find.

14. In all the circumstances this appeal fails.

Notice of Decision

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.  The decision of  the  First-
tier Tribunal is affirmed.
