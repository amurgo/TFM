                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clark, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellants

 1. The appellants applied with permission to appeal against  the  decision
    of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  R   Hopkins  who  refused  the   first
    appellant's appeal for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier
    2 (General) Migrant under the points-based system and  further  refused
    the  dependent  appellants'  appeals  on  the  basis  that  the   first
    appellant's appeal had been refused. The Secretary of State's  decision
    was made on 3 December 2014.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Gillespie
    on the basis that the judge had applied the wrong code in  relation  to
    the Tier 2 application but at the  hearing  before  me,  Mr  Clarke  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State for the Home Office, provided evidence
    to the effect that the appellants had voluntarily departed  the  United
    Kingdom on 13th May 2016 and as such the appeal had been abandoned.

 3. At the hearing neither the appellants nor any  representative  attended
    but I was satisfied that the appellants had been advised of  the  date,
    time and venue of the hearing and that  it  was  in  the  interests  of
    justice  to  proceed  in  the  absence  of  the   appellants   in   the
    circumstances.

 4. The appellants had applied on 25 November 2014 for a leave  as  Tier  2
    (General) Migrant and dependants  and  that  decision  was  made  on  3
    December 2014.  Article 8 of  the  Immigration  Act  2014  Commencement
    Number 4 Transitional and Savings Provisions and Amendment  Order  2015
    has amended Article 9 of the Immigration Act 2014 Commencement Number 3
    Transitional and Saving Provisions Order  2014,  to  the  effect  that,
    under the amended Article 9 the saved provisions which included Section
    104(4) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2004  which
    resided in part 5 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,
    continued to have effect  on  certain  decisions  and  those  decisions
    included

         "A decision  made  before  6  April  2015  in  relation  to  which,
         immediately before 6 April 2015, an appeal could  have been  bought
         or was pending under the saved provisions."

 5. This appeal falls under that section and as such I  conclude  that  the
    appellants  having  departed  from  the  United  Kingdom  have   indeed
    abandoned their appeal and therefore  there  is  no  longer  an  appeal
    before me.

No anonymity direction is made.


Signed

Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington                     Date 12th August 2016
