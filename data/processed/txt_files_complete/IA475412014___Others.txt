For the Appellants:    Mr A Sreevalsalan, Solicitor of Legend Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Sreeraman, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellants. nationals of India,  dates  of  birth  respectively  13
    November 1979, 11 June 1983 and [ - ] appealed against the Respondent's
    decisions dated 11 November 2014 to refuse to vary leave to remain as a
    Tier 1 (General) Migrant and dependants.   Their  appeals  came  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lingam who  on  3  July  2015  allowed  their
    appeals in respect of grounds of refusal relating to paragraph  322  of
    the Immigration Rules but submitted the  matter  to  the  Secretary  of
    State to make a decision in accordance with law in  relation  to  other
    grounds in being.

2.   That course was agreed between the parties before  the  Judge  and  the
    Judge concurred with it.

3.   The permission to  appeal  was  given  on  12  November  2015  and  the
    Respondent made a Rule 24 response on 16 December 2015.  At the hearing
    of the appeal Mr Sreevalsalan indicated that  the  Appellants  did  not
    wish to pursue their appeal against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge but rather were content for the matter to be determined,
    as previously agreed, by the Secretary of State.

4.   In the circumstances Ms Sreeraman agreed with that  course  and  raised
    no objections.  Accordingly I find the Original Tribunal made no  error
    of law  and  the  appeals  are  dismissed  subject  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's Judge's determination as to the proper consideration of  the
    claims by the Secretary of State.

DECISION

Appeals dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
