                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr B Chimpango
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Temilade Tejumade Oluwatuyi, date of birth 5.7.77,  is  a
    citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bruce, who allowed her appeal against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 19.4.13, to refuse entry clearance to
    the United Kingdom as  a  partner,  pursuant  to  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 1.4.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Davey  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    29.4.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 17.6.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Bruce should be set aside.

 6. I note that there is no cross appeal against the First-tier  Tribunal's
    dismissal of the appeal on immigration grounds.  In  the  circumstances
    that decision must stand. The respondent appeals  against  the  judge's
    decision in relation to human rights.

 7. The relevant background can be summarised  as  follows.  The  appellant
    came to the UK as  a  visitor  but  overstayed  and  worked  illegally.
    Following conviction and sentence in 2005 to 12 months imprisonment for
    obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception the appellant was  removed
    to Nigeria. In 2009 she applied to return as the spouse of Mr  Olubunmi
    Oluwatuyi, a British citizen, but  was  refused  on  the  grounds  that
    exclusion was conducive to the public good and her appeal dismissed  in
    2010 by Judge Herwald. There was no appeal against that  determination,
    which found that the appellant had a serious criminal record  and  that
    it would be undesireable to grant her entry clearance.

 8. The application the subject of the present appeal was made  on  14.1.13
    and refused on 31.5.13 on the basis that her conviction  is  not  spent
    and thus her application has to be refused under Appendix FM and it was
    undesirable to grant entry on compassionate  grounds,  because  of  her
    character and conduct. There were also other failures  to  comply  with
    the requirements of Appendix  FM.  The  Entry  Clearance  Manager  also
    raised the issue as to whether  there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship.

 9. Judge Bruce correctly found that the appeal  could  not  succeed  under
    Appendix FM because, as explained  at  �8  of  the  determination,  the
    appellant does not meet the suitability requirements of  section  S-EC,
    because a period of 10 years had not  elapsed  since  the  end  of  her
    sentence. In such circumstances, "unless refusal would be  contrary  to
    (ECHR  and  Refugee  Convention),  it  will  only  be  in   exceptional
    circumstances that the public interest in maintaining refusal  will  be
    outweighed by compelling factors."

10. At �10, although she disagreed with the conclusion, Judge  Bruce  found
    that she was bound by the unappealed findings of Judge Herwald that the
    appellant  had  a  serious  criminal  record  and  that  it  would   be
    undesirable to grant her entry clearance.  There  was  no  evidence  to
    justify departing from that finding and thus judge Bruce concluded that
    the appellant fell foul of the ground of refusal under S-EC 1.5.

11. I'm not sure I understand Judge  Bruce's  remarks  at  �10,  where  she
    stated that she would  have  no  hesitation  in  reaching  a  different
    conclusion from Judge Herwald. However, whether S-EC 1.4  or  S-EC  1.5
    applies, the effect is the same, that the application has to be refused
    under Appendix FM.  The  application  could  not  succeed  under  other
    provisions of Appendix FM because section S-EC is  a  mandatory  ground
    for refusal of entry clearance.

12. Judge Bruce then proceeded to consider whether the appellant's and  her
    husband's circumstances in relation to human rights justified  allowing
    entry clearance to the UK as a partner,  despite  inability  to  comply
    with section S-EC.

13. Judge Bruce found that the marriage was genuine and subsisting and that
    the parties intended to live together. She also found  that  there  was
    family life between the appellant and his wife and that the refusal  to
    grant entry clearance was a very serious interference with that  family
    life. In essence, Judge Bruce went through the Razgar steps and reached
    the eventual conclusion that she would have allowed an  application  to
    revoke a deportation order and  that  the  decision  was  unjustifiably
    harsh. Having dismissed the appeal on immigration  grounds,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.

14. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Davey noted  that  the  grounds
    raise arguable errors of law in the assessment of relevant  factors  in
    the article 8 ECHR proportionality assessment and in  relation  to  the
    public interest remarks at �14 of the determination.

15. I disagree with Judge Davey's statement at �3 that grounds 5 and 6 were
    unlikely to succeed "because notwithstanding Gulshan and Nagre, article
    8 outside of  the  Immigration  Rules  falls  to  be  considered  under
    European case law and as demonstrated by Huang [2007] UKHL  11  and  MF
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192." That is not an accurate  statement  of
    the current case law. It is no longer good law that there must be a two-
    stage process, first under the Immigration Rules and then under article
    8 ECHR on the basis of Razgar.

16. Having found the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  for  leave  to  remain,  Judge  Bruce  should  have
    considered whether the  appellant's  circumstances  might  arguably  be
    sufficiently  compelling  and  insufficiently  recognised  within   the
    Immigration Rules so as to justify granting the application outside the
    Immigration Rules on the basis of article 8, as  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State produces  a  result  that  is  unjustifiably  harsh.
    Whilst  Judge  Bruce  did  find  the  decision  to  be  in   her   view
    "unjustifiably harsh," she appeared to have  done  so  under  a  Razgar
    consideration of article  8  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  without
    consideration of the current case law setting out what must take  place
    before that stage can be embarked upon.


17. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the Court of  Appeal  held
    that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a
    complete code but involve the application of  a  proportionality  test.
    Whether that is done within the new rules or outside the new  rules  as
    part of the article 8 general law was described as a sterile  question,
    as either way the result should be  the  same;  what  matters  is  that
    proportionality balancing exercise is required to be  carried  out.  In
    other words, a proportionality test is required whether under  the  new
    rules or article 8. MF (Nigeria) was followed in Kabia (MF: para 398  -
    "exceptional circumstances") 2013 UKUT 00569 (IAC).


18. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) the Upper Tribunal set out, inter alia, that on the current state
    of the authorities:


            (b)    after applying the requirements of the  Rules,  only  if
           there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
           outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
           consider  whether  there  are   compelling   circumstances   not
           sufficiently recognised under them: R (on  the  application  of)
           Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWHC
           720 (Admin);


           (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such as
           Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount:
           MF (Article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria  [2012]  UKUT  00393  (IAC);
           Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013]  UKUT  00045  (IAC);  they
           concern  the  practical  possibilities  of  relocation.  In  the
           absence of such insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to
           show other non-standard and  particular  features  demonstrating
           that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.


19. The case also explained that  the  Secretary  of  State  addressed  the
    Article 8 family aspects  of  the  respondent's  position  through  the
    Rules,  in  particular  EX1,  and  the  private  life  aspects  through
    paragraph 276ADE. Only if there were arguably good grounds for granting
    leave to remain outside the rules was it necessary for him for  Article
    8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  were  compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules.


20. More recently, in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:


    (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to identify  in  her
         decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR does not
         prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so on the  basis  of
         the materials before it.

     (ii)  "Maintenance of effective immigration  control"  whilst  not  as
         such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR  can  normally
         be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of  disorder  or
         crime" or an aspect of "economic  well-being  of  the  country"  or
         both.

     (iii)  "[P]revention of disorder or crime" is  normally  a  legitimate
         aim both in expulsion cases where there has been  criminal  conduct
         on the part of the claimant and in expulsion cases where there have
         only been breaches of immigration law.

     (iv)   MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 held that the new immigration
         rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal  are  a  complete
         code. This was because  of  the  express  requirement  in  them  at
         paragraph 398 to have regard to exceptional circumstances and other
         factors.

     (v)    It follows from this that any other rule which  has  a  similar
         provision will also constitute a complete code;

     (vi)  Where an area of  the  rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31]  in  particular)
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements
         of the rules, only if  there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
         purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

21. The provisions of Appendix FM are the Secretary of State's response  to
    private and family life  and  are  intended  to  be  a  complete  code.
    Applying the above guidance and case authority, the judge  should  have
    identified the compelling circumstances  insufficiently  recognised  in
    the Immigration Rules so as to justify considering  article  8  outside
    the Rules. I accept that some of the factors set out  by  Judge  Bruce,
    particularly in �15 and �16 could be  deployed  to  support  compelling
    circumstances, but those factors were in fact  being  relied  on  in  a
    proportionality assessment. In other words, the judge went straight  to
    the article 8 assessment.


22. Even if Judge Bruce  was  justified  in  proceeding  to  an  article  8
    assessment, I also find an error of law in �14  of  the  determination,
    where as part of the Razgar considerations, the judge  notes  that  the
    aim pursued by the Secretary of State is the protection of the  economy
    through the maintenance  of effective immigration control  and  stated,
    "there is absolutely no evidential basis for suggesting that it  is  to
    prevent crime and disorder." However, the very basis of the suitability
    requirements of S-EC 1.4 & 1.5 is  the  protection  of  the  public,  a
    legitimate aim which case law indicates carries a higher weight in  the
    proportionality assessment than the economic well-being of  the  state.
    Both S-EC 1.4 and 1.5 specifically refer to exclusion  being  conducive
    to the public  good,  which  was  also  the  finding  of  the  previous
    determination of Judge Herwald. It follows that in considering only the
    economic well-being of  the  UK,  the  proportionality  assessment  was
    necessarily flawed.

23. Further, rather more minor but nevertheless significant,  factors  were
    left out of the proportionality assessment, including considerations as
    to maintenance and accommodation, both of  which  were  raised  in  the
    refusal decision. These requirements of Appendix FM would have  had  to
    be complied  with  even  if  the  appellant  was  not  stymied  by  the
    suitability requirements. These should have been brought  into  account
    in any proportionality assessment.

24. In the circumstances, I find  errors  of  law  in  the  making  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that the decision in  relation
    to human rights should be set  aside  and  remade.   I  indicated  this
    finding to the parties at the hearing before me and  then  heard  their
    further submissions on the remaking of the decision.

25. Mr Chimpango submitted that there  were  in  this  case  exception  and
    compelling circumstances rendering the decision unjustifiably harsh. He
    highlighted those factors set out by  Judge  Bruce  and  in  particular
    relied on the difficulties in travelling to and residing in Nigeria  as
    a British citizen with multiple and serious health issues. He submitted
    that there were more factors in favour of  allowing  the  appellant  to
    join her husband in the UK than to  prevent  her  from  doing  so.  The
    sponsor works for the Home Office and is established  in  the  UK  with
    disability allowance and an income upwards of �20,000.

26. In considering whether the appellant and/or the sponsor's circumstances
    are compelling and insufficiently recognised in the  Immigration  Rules
    that leave to enter  should,  exceptionally,  be  granted  outside  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis of family life under article 8  ECHR,  I
    take into account that because the appellant fails at  the  suitability
    requirements, no consideration  of  exception  EX1  and  insurmountable
    obstacles has taken place. However, the Secretary of  State  considered
    whether entry clearance should be granted on compassionate grounds  but
    in the  light  of  her  character  and  conduct  it  was  found  to  be
    undesirable to grant entry clearance.

27. As the "mechanism" referred to in Shahzad is not  available  under  the
    Immigration Rules, I take the approach that,  "only  if  there  may  be
    arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them  is  it
    necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there are
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them."

28. I take into account those factors already set out by  Judge  Bruce  and
    adopt her finding that this is a genuine and  subsisting  marriage  and
    that they wish and intend to live together in the UK. However,  I  have
    to bear in mind the public interest that the exclusion of the appellant
    has been deemed to be conducive to the public good and that  there  has
    been an  unchallenged  previous  determination  to  that  effect.  That
    determination also found the appellant to be "without doubt, a liar,  a
    cheat and a dishonest woman" and that it would be undesirable to  grant
    her entry clearance to the UK. The appellant was removed  from  the  UK
    because of her criminal conduct and normally may not apply to re  enter
    until 10 years have elapsed from end of  her  sentence  (not  just  the
    release date). I take into account that this public interest carries  a
    higher weight than the normal consideration of protection  of  economic
    well-being.

29. I have to take into account as a significant factor that the  appellant
    has not been able to comply with the Immigration Rules for entry  as  a
    partner.

30. I also have to take into account that the relationship was entered into
    after the appellant had been removed from the UK  in  2006.  They  were
    married in Nigeria in 2009 at a time when they should have  been  aware
    that it would be very difficult for the appellant to  be  permitted  to
    return to the UK for  some  time  to  come,  because  of  her  criminal
    conviction and removal. They were apparently willing  to  continue  the
    relationship, with the sponsor visiting the appellant in  Nigeria.  Her
    application for entry in 2009 was refused because she failed to declare
    her unspent conviction.

31. I take into account that Mr Oluwatuyi's health conditions would make it
    difficult for him to settle in Nigeria. He has obstructive sleep apnoea
    syndrome, hypertension and breathing difficulties requiring the use  of
    oxygen at night and personal care and assistance. However, he has  been
    able to maintain his employment and has managed each year to visit  the
    appellant in Nigeria, staying for approximately one month. I also  note
    that there are generators available to ensure that if  the  electricity
    supply failed his oxygen supply would continue. These are  difficulties
    and may be hardships, but not ones that cannot reasonably be  overcome,
    if the sponsor wishes to  continue  family  life  with  the  appellant.
    Otherwise, the sponsor would not have been able to visit the  appellant
    on a regular basis,  which  he  is  able  to  continue  doing.  In  the
    circumstances, I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  circumstances  of  the
    appellant and her husband can properly be described as compelling.

32. It is illustrative that in Gulshan the Upper Tribunal  considered  that
    it was not unduly harsh for a husband who originated from Pakistan  but
    was now a British national, to return to Pakistan with his wife who was
    seeking leave to remain as his spouse. The panel acknowledged that  the
    couple would suffer some hardship, as he had been in the UK since 2002,
    he had worked here and was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and
    other state benefits,  some  of  which  could  not  be  transferred  to
    Pakistan.


33. Considering all the evidence in the round, as  a  whole,  and  for  the
    reasons stated, I  am  not  satisfied  that  there  are  in  this  case
    compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised in  the  Immigration
    Rules that justify, exceptionally, allowing  this  appeal  outside  the
    Immigration Rules under article 8 ECHR on the basis that  the  decision
    is unjustifiably harsh.


Conclusions:

34. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision,  preserving  the  findings  in
                    relation to the Immigration Rules.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: the appeal has been dismissed.
