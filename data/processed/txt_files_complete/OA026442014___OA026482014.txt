For the Appellant:     Mr Z Jafferji, instructed by Eurasia Legal Services
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The appellants, mother and son, are  citizens  of  Bangladesh,  born  on  12
April 1960 and 24 November 1996. They applied for  entry  clearance  to  the
United Kingdom on 13 October 2013 to settle as the spouse and child  of  the
sponsor, Azam Ali,  who  had  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
Kingdom.

The appellants' applications were initially refused by the respondent on  12
January 2014. The  respondent  noted  that  the  sponsor  had  been  granted
indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of  14  years'
residency and considered that the fact that  he  had  purposely  evaded  the
authorities for that  period  in  order  to  qualify  under  the  long  term
residency  concession  demonstrated  his  willingness   to   disregard   the
immigration rules. The respondent noted that the  first  appellant  and  the
sponsor were married in 1977. The  sponsor  had  subsequently  gone  to  the
United Kingdom and there was no evidence that he saw the  appellants  during
the 14 years in  which  he  was  living  in  the  United  Kingdom  prior  to
regularising his stay. The appellants last saw the sponsor in February  2013
and their applications  were  submitted  eight  months  thereafter.  In  the
circumstances, and given the absence of  evidence  of  regular  and  ongoing
contact,  the  respondent  did  not  accept  that  the   first   appellant's
relationship with the sponsor  was  genuine  and  subsisting  or  that  they
intended to live together permanently  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  first
appellant's application was therefore refused  under  paragraph  EC-P.1.1(d)
of Appendix FM of the immigration rules, with  reference  to  paragraphs  E-
ECP.2.6 & 2.10.

The respondent considered further that  the  appellants  did  not  meet  the
income threshold requirement and the related evidential  requirements  under
Appendix FM,  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  and  Appendix  FM-SE  as  the  documents
produced in relation  to  the  sponsor's  employment  and  income  were  not
accepted as reliable, since the amount on the payslips  did  not  correspond
with the deposits shown in the sponsor's bank statements  and  the  payslips
each showed identical amounts of net pay.  The  respondent  did  not  accept
that the sponsor was in receipt of the income claimed from his  two  claimed
jobs. The respondent noted that in order to meet the financial  requirements
of the rules, the sponsor's gross income had to  be  at  least  �22,400  per
annum but the evidence of his income was not accepted.

The  second  appellant's  application  was  refused  in  line   with   first
appellant's application, under Appendix FM,  paragraph  EC-C.1.1(d)  and  E-
ECC.1.6.

The respondent, however, did not make a final decision since  the  Secretary
of State's appeal against the decision in MM, R (On the  Application  Of)  v
The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 was  awaited
in relation to the maintenance requirements of the rules.

On 13 October 2014  the  respondent  then  made  a  final  decision  in  the
appellants' applications, repeating the refusal reasons given previously.

The appellants appealed against the decisions and the appeals were heard  on
13 November 2014 in the First-tier Tribunal by Judge Ghani. The judge  heard
from the sponsor and noted his evidence that he  obtained  indefinite  leave
to remain in March 2012 and was unable to visit his  wife  and  children  in
Bangladesh until January 2013. He married his wife in 1977 and came  to  the
United Kingdom in March 1993. They had five children. He visited his  family
again in July 2014 and had kept in regular contact  with  him.  The  sponsor
claimed to have two jobs, with Balti Hut, owned by Mrs Rongmala  Begum,  and
West  Bromwich  Bangladeshi  Welfare  Association  and  Islamic  Centre.  He
claimed that he had sufficient  income  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
immigration  rules  and  had  produced  payslips,  bank  statements  and  an
employment history letter from the HMRC showing that he  earned  �22,888  in
the financial year 2013/14. He was paid cash in hand  and  did  not  deposit
all the earnings into his bank account, but his employers paid the  due  tax
and declared his income to the HMRC.

Judge Ghani accepted that the first appellant and  the  sponsor  were  in  a
genuine and subsisting relationship. However he  did  not  accept  that  the
financial requirements of the rules were  met.  He  noted  that  the  amount
deposited into the sponsor's bank account was far less than what he  claimed
to earn and he found the letter from HMRC to be unclear as to the period  of
pay. He considered that there remained doubts as to  the  amount  earned  by
the sponsor and he found that the  requirements  of  the  immigration  rules
could not be met. He concluded further that the decision did not breach  the
appellants' Article 8 rights.

Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought on  the  grounds  that
the judge had failed to carry out  a  proper  assessment  of  the  sponsor's
total income  and  had  erred  by  rejecting  the  letter  from  HMRC  which
confirmed the income as claimed. It was asserted that  the  requirements  of
Appendix FM were met and  furthermore  that  the  judge  had  erred  in  his
assessment of Article 8.

Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Martin on  16  February  2015
on the grounds that the judge had arguably misunderstood the  document  from
the HMRC which showed that the sponsor had earned �22,888 in  the  tax  year
2013-14.

Appeal hearing and submissions

The appeals came before me on 20 July  2015.  I  heard  submissions  on  the
error of law.

Mr Smart submitted that the appeals could not have succeeded  as  there  was
no evidence in the form of bank statements corroborating  the  salary  shown
in the payslips. The judge made adequate findings on Article 8.

Mr Jafferji submitted that the judge had made an error in the  consideration
of the HMRC letter and had also erred by considering the  rules  which  were
not in force at the time of the respondent's decision. The judge  had  erred
by failing to explain how much of the sponsor's  income  correlated  to  the
deposits shown in the bank statements and that was relevant  to  Article  8.
The sponsor earned sufficient income to meet  the  rules  and  even  if  the
evidential requirements were not met, that was relevant  to  the  Article  8
assessment.

On the basis of Mr Jafferji's submission that the judge had  considered  the
immigration rules in force subsequent  to  the  respondent's  decision,  and
when taken together with the fact that the judge had  plainly  misunderstood
the HMRC  letter,  I  found  that  his  decision  contained  errors  of  law
requiring it to be set aside. I then heard submissions with a  view  to  re-
making the decision.

Mr Jafferji submitted that the sponsor's net earnings were  �9652  and  that
the amount paid into his bank account was �8760, making the  shortfall  only
marginal. On the basis that without the strict requirements of Appendix  FM-
SE the sponsor would have met the threshold, and considering the  fact  that
the second appellant would not be able to make a  fresh  application  as  he
would be  over  18,  Mr  Jafferji  submitted  that  there  were  exceptional
circumstances such that the appeals ought to succeed under Article 8.

Mr Smart submitted that it was not accepted that the sponsor earned what  he
claimed to earn and the HMRC letter was no more than proof of what had  been
declared as earnings. There were no compelling  circumstances  justifying  a
grant of leave outside the rules.

Mr Jafferji responded by reiterating his previous submissions.

Consideration and findings

Having heard Mr Jafferji's  submission,  that  the  judge  had  applied  the
immigration rules which were not in force at the time  of  the  respondent's
decisions (namely Appendix FM-SE1(n)), I considered that  his  decision  was
materially flawed and had to be set aside.  However  having  now  considered
the documents further it seems to me  that  that  submission  was  incorrect
when considering that the relevant decisions were made on 13  October  2014,
rather than 12 January 2014, the date of the  initial  decisions.  Paragraph
FM-SE1(n) was inserted on 6 April 2014 and was therefore  in  force  at  the
time of the decisions of 13 October 2014.

However, it remains the case that the judge erred in  his  understanding  of
the letter from HMRC of 4 September 2014.  Contrary  to  his  understanding,
that letter gave the figures for the declared income  for  the  sponsor  for
one year, namely for the tax year 2013-14. The start and end dates  referred
to in the table in that letter referred not to the period  of  earnings  but
to the dates of employment with the various employers. Whether or  not  that
error in itself would justify the setting aside of the judge's  decision  is
questionable, and probably would not do so, given that the appellants  could
not  in  any  event  meet  the  requirements  of  the  rules,  the  ultimate
conclusion I reach in re-making the decision is nevertheless the same.

It is clear that the appellants could not meet the  evidential  requirements
of the  rules  in  Appendix  FM-SE  with  respect  to  the  relevant  income
threshold requirement of �22,400 per annum. Appendix FM-SE 2. requires  that
all of the specified evidence  must  be  provided  in  respect  of  salaried
employment, namely (a) payslips, (b) a letter from the employers who  issued
the payslips and (c) personal bank  statements  corresponding  to  the  same
periods as the payslips showing  the  salary  paid  into  the  account.  The
letters produced  by  the  appellants  from  the  sponsor's  employers  were
produced after the respondent's decision and there  was  no  such  specified
evidence produced to the respondent when the decision was made.  Furthermore
the amounts on the pay slips do not correspond with the  deposits  into  the
sponsor's bank account. I find no merit in  Mr  Jafferji's  submission  that
the total amount paid into the sponsor's account over  the  relevant  period
is not significantly different from the amount of salary  in  the  payslips,
since there is no way of knowing the source of the deposits and there is  no
consistency between the dates of the deposits and the dates  of  the  salary
payments.

Neither do I find that the HMRC letter  materially  assists  the  appellants
since, as Mr Smart submitted, it is no  more  than  a  confirmation  of  the
income declared by or on behalf of the sponsor and is thus  limited  in  its
evidential weight. Such letters do not form part of  the  required  evidence
within Appendix FM-SE, no doubt for that very reason. Mr Jafferji  asked  me
to find that if the sponsor had wanted to create an income for the  purposes
of the applications he would not have produced  evidence  of  two  different
jobs and been able to produce evidence  from  professional  accountants  for
the businesses. However I find little merit in that  submission,  given  the
lengths that the sponsor was clearly prepared to go to in  order  to  secure
permanent residence in the United Kingdom, namely  spending  over  14  years
apart from his family and evading the United Kingdom  authorities  for  that
period. It is also of some note that the same accountants appear to act  for
both employers. Accordingly I find that  the  evidence  does  not  establish
that the sponsor's income is as claimed and I conclude that  the  appellants
have not been able to meet the requirements of the immigration rules.

As regards Article 8 of the ECHR, I do not accept Mr  Jafferji's  submission
that there are compelling circumstances justifying a grant of leave  outside
the immigration rules. I do not accept that  the  appellants'  inability  to
meet the income requirements of the immigration rules is  due  simply  to  a
technicality as a result of the evidential  requirements.  For  the  reasons
given above it has not been established that the sponsor  meets  the  income
threshold in any event. As regards the family ties, the  lengthy  period  of
time in which they have lived apart is  plainly  material  and  weakens  the
strength of those ties. Whilst it may be the case that  the  respondent  has
legitimised the  sponsor's  status  by  granting  him  indefinite  leave  to
remain, the fact remains that he was  prepared  to  spend  14  years  living
unlawfully in the United Kingdom, apart from his family, in order to  obtain
permanent residence here. Even  after  obtaining  his  grant  of  indefinite
leave he did not visit his family until almost a year later and has  visited
them only twice for short periods of time. The appellants'  applications  to
join him in the United Kingdom were made a year and  a  half  after  he  was
granted indefinite leave to remain. Although  it  is  accepted  that  family
life has been established for the purposes of Article 8, the appellants  and
sponsor have chosen to conduct their family  life  by  living  in  different
countries for a significant period of time and it is clear that  the  family
ties are therefore limited. Mr Jafferji asked me  to  take  account  of  the
fact  that  the  second  appellant  would  not  be  able  to  make  a  fresh
application as he is now over 18 years of age. However that was as a  result
of choices made by the family and does not, in my view,  make  the  family's
circumstances compelling. For all of these reasons, and  having  had  regard
to the public interest considerations in section  117  of  the  Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  I  do  not  find  that  the  respondent's
decision is disproportionate or in breach of Article 8.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeals on all grounds.

DECISION

The making of the decision by the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law. In  re-making  the  decision  I  dismiss  the
appellants' appeals on all grounds.
