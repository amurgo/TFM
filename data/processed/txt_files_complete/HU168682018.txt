Representation:
For the Appellant:      Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting
                 Officer
For the Respondent: Mr R Alavi (Appellant's husband and sponsor)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      BACKGROUND

    1. This is an appeal by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.   For  ease  of
       reference, I refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier
       Tribunal.  The Respondent appeals against a decision  of  First-Tier
       Tribunal Judge C  H  Bennett  promulgated  on  22  July  2019  ("the
       Decision") allowing the Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's
       decision dated 16 July 2018 refusing her entry for settlement as the
       wife of a British citizen.  The Appellant is  a  national  of  Iran.
       She is married to Mr Alavi, who attended the appeal on  her  behalf.
       I refer to him hereafter as the Sponsor.


    2. The Appellant and the Sponsor lived together in Northern Cyprus  for
       about seventeen months prior to the application for entry clearance.
        The Sponsor has returned to the UK.  The Appellant currently  lives
       in Iran.


    3. The Respondent refused the Appellant's application on the basis that
       she could not meet the financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration
       Rules ("the Rules").  The couple are required to show that they meet
       the Minimum Income Threshold ("the MIR").  The  Respondent  was  not
       satisfied that there were "exceptional circumstances" justifying the
       grant of entry outside the Rules.


    4. The Appellant and the Sponsor are both retired.  Both are in receipt
       of pension.  The  Respondent  accepted  that  the  Sponsor  received
       �14,072.42 per annum by way of pension but made no reference to  the
       Appellant's pension income when refusing  entry.   The  couple  also
       receive rental income from a property in Iran.  The Respondent  took
       that  into  account  but  was  not  satisfied  that  the   documents
       demonstrating that income met the requirements of Appendix FM-SE  to
       the Rules.  That appendix contains stringent requirements as to  the
       documentation to show that the relevant paragraph of  the  Rules  is
       met.  In any event, the Respondent calculated the rental  income  as
       �3,577.08 which was insufficient to meet the MIR which  is  in  this
       case �18,600.


    5. Based on his assessment of the evidence, both documentary  and  oral
       (given by the Sponsor), the Judge expressed himself to be  satisfied
       that this showed that the couple do meet the MIR.   Accordingly,  he
       found that the Appellant met the financial requirements of the Rules
       and, since that was the only reason for refusal within the Rules, he
       allowed the appeal on that basis and within the Rules.


    6. The Respondent appeals on the basis that the  Judge  has  materially
       misdirected himself in law.  It is contended that the  Judge  failed
       to consider paragraph 10 of Appendix FM-SE concerning the  documents
       required to evidence the Appellant's own pension  income.   Although
       the Judge refers to paragraph 10 at [10]  of  the  Decision,  it  is
       asserted that the reasoning which follows as to how those provisions
       are met is inconsistent with the nature of  the  specified  evidence
       regime and accordingly has led to an error of law.   The argument is
       neatly encapsulated in the renewed application to this  Tribunal  as
       follows:


           "... the grounds argue that the First Tier  Tribunal  Judge  has
           overlooked  the  requirement  for  the  appellant   to   produce
           financial information in  a  format  that  meets  the  specified
           evidence requirements of paragraph 10 of Appendix FM SE  of  the
           Immigration rules.  It is argued that by accepting oral evidence
           as a way of circumventing these  requirements,  the  First  Tier
           Tribunal Judge has materially erred in law ..."


    7. Permission to appeal was refused by Resident Judge J F W Phillips on
       4 October 2019 in the following terms (so far as relevant):


            "... 3.    There is no arguable  error  of  law.   The  grounds
           quote selectively from the very detailed  decision.   The  Judge
           details very clearly (at para 20) the  Appellant's  evidence  of
           the source of the payments into his bank account.   He  explains
           at para 23 why he accepts this evidence.  The Judge was entitled
           to come to his own conclusion on the evidence and has  explained
           clearly how he reached that conclusion."


    8. Permission to appeal was granted following  renewed  application  by
       Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic on 24 January 2020 in the following terms
       (so far as relevant):


           "... The respondent argues that the judge erred in finding  that
           the requirements of paragraph 10 of Appendix FM SE had been  met
           despite his acknowledgement that the  bank  statements  did  not
           evidence the pension payments as required (at 22).  It is argued
           that his acceptance of the sponsor's oral evidence  in  lieu  of
           the specified documentary evidence (at 23) was a misdirection in
           law.


           It is arguable that the judge sought to circumvent the rules  by
           accepting oral evidence in place of documentary  evidence  in  a
           specified format and permission is, therefore, granted."


    9. The matter comes before me to decide whether  there  is  a  material
       error of law in the Decision and, if I so find, to either remit  the
       appeal to the First-tier Tribunal or re-make the  Decision  in  this
       Tribunal.


      ERROR OF LAW


   10. Mr Whitwell relied on the grounds.  He referred me to  paragraph  10
       of Appendix FM-SE and in particular paragraph 10(e) which relates to
       the evidence required to show income from a  pension  received  from
       abroad (as is the position with the Appellant's own pension).   That
       paragraph reads as follows:

           "(e) To evidence a pension:
           (i) Official documentation from:
               (1) ...;
               (2) An overseas pension authority; or ...
           confirming pension entitlement and amount (and, where
           applicable, reflecting any funds withdrawn from the pension
           account or fund).
           (ii) At least one personal bank statement in the 12-month period
           prior to the date of application showing payment of the pension
           into the person's account."


   11. That paragraph is cited at [10(e)] of the Decision.  Thereafter,  in
       relation  to  the  Appellant's  pension,  the  Judge  recorded   the
       following evidence:


            "17. No statements of any account which Mrs  M  held  with  any
           bankers, and into which either the  pension  payments  from  the
           Retirement Fund Institute of the Iran National Copper Industries
           Company or the rent  from  Mrs  M's  flat  had  been  paid  were
           submitted in support of the appeal before the hearing on 21 June
           2019.  Mr A did not, at the hearing, produce any  statements  of
           Mrs M's accounts with her bankers.  Mr Pareek obtained from  the
           entry  clearance  officer's  (on  line)  file  details  of   the
           documents which the entry clearance officer had recorded that he
           had been seen, and which he had returned to  Mr  A.   That  file
           showed (16 July 2018 at 1140:02) that
                 'Income from other non-employment sources (rental  income).
                 Title Deed for property owned in  Iran  by  the  applicant,
                 along with lease agreement and bank  statements  showing  6
                 month rent payment. Specified  docs  not  provided.  Income
                 from  property  is  �3,577.08.   Income  from   pension   &
                 permitted  benefits  TFL   Pension   �14,072.42.    Capital
                 Combined Income: �17,649.50.  Maintenance not met'...
           The entry clearance officer's record shows that  the  supporting
           documents had been returned to  Mr  A  on  17  July  2018.   The
           documents recorded as having been returned do  not  include  any
           document from the Retirement Fund Institute of the Iran National
           Copper Industries Company.
           18.   Over and above the fact that the entry clearance officer's
           record (above)  makes  no  reference  to  his  having  seen  any
           document from the Retirement Fund Institute of the Iran National
           Copper Industries Company,  it  is  apparent  that  he  recorded
           having seen bank statements showing only  6  months  payment  of
           rent.
           19.   Mr A told me that
           (a)   Mrs M had submitted statements of her account with Tejarat
                 Bank (in Iran) covering a period of 6  months  (implicitly,
                 to vouch her pension and rental income), and
           (b)   he had been informed  in  an  e-mail  from  UK  Visas  and
                 Immigration (27 July 2018) [footnote omitted]
                       'In response to your query, your bank statements must
                       show evidence from the last 6 months for the  correct
                       amount of the finances you have been receiving',
           (c)   it was not possible for the statements of Mrs M's  account
                 to be printed out in western script -  and  that,  if  they
                 were to be printed out, they would have to be  printed  out
                 in Iranians script, and
           (d)   it would not be easy  to  obtain  statements  (in  western
                 script) covering the 12 month period, but he would  do  his
                 best to obtain them and bring them to Taylor House by  1630
                 hours on Friday 28 June 2019.
           I informed Mr A that,
           [A]   if he provided statements of Mrs M's account with  Tejarat
           Bank covering the 12 month period  prior  to  the  date  of  the
           application (11 May 2018) printed in western script and/or  with
           necessary translations and showing credit entries in respect  of
           Mrs M's rental  and  pension  income,  I  would  consider  them,
           provided that
                 (1)   they were received at Taylor  House  no  later  than
                 1630 hrs on Friday 28 June 2019,
                 (2)   copies of  any  such  statements  were  sent  to  Mr
                 Pareek, to arrive no later than the above  time  and  date,
                 and
           [B]   if he experienced significant  difficulties  in  obtaining
                 the statements  covering  the  12  month  period  (and  any
                 necessary translations)  within  the  above  timescale,  he
                 should explain the difficulties.
           20.    Following  the  hearing,  Mr  A  sent  me  the  following
                 documents.
           (a)   His e-mail to UK Visas and Immigration  sent  on  26  July
                 2018...
           (b)   A printout of the statement of Mrs M's  account  with  the
                 Tejarat Bank (vouched by the stamp of  the  Kerman  Bahonar
                 University Branch) covering the period 16 March 2017  until
                 29 April 2018.  The statement shows  the  following  credit
                 entries.  The sources  of  those  credit  entries  are  not
                 themselves identified in the text of the statement.  But Mr
                 A marked the statement to identify  the  sources  as  shown
                 below..."


       There then follows a tabulated analysis of the credit entries in the
       statements  with  a  column  recording  "Mr  A's  explanation".   Mr
       Whitwell confirmed that the Respondent does not take issue with  the
       substance of the evidence there recorded.  Her point is rather  that
       the bank statement does not speak for  itself;  the  source  of  the
       credit entries can only be established when read with the  Sponsor's
       explanation.   That  is  inconsistent  with  the   requirement   for
       specified evidence.


   12. The Judge goes on to make  the  following  findings  based  on  that
       evidence:


            "21. There is no difficulty in identifying the rental  payments
           from the credit entries in the statement of Mrs M's account with
           the Tejerat Bank - since  the  payments  made  accord  (broadly,
           although that on the 24 March 2018 is Rls 2,000,000 short of the
           Rls 19,000,000 required under the agreement extending the  term)
           with those provided for under the  Lease  Contract  (see  above,
           paragraph 15(c)).  I am therefore satisfied that,  although  the
           statement of the account  does  not  specifically  identify  the
           source of the payments, those credit entries which I have listed
           in the 2nd column of the above table are payments in respect  of
           rent.  I  am  also  satisfied  that,  in  the  12  month  period
           immediately prior to the date on which Mrs M applied  for  entry
           clearance, 11 May  2018,  the  total  rental  income  which  she
           received, as  vouched  by  the  above  credit  entries  was  Rls
           230,400,000.
            22.  The credit entries relating to the sums stated by Mr A  to
           be payments in respect  of  Mrs  M's  pension  are  less  easily
           identifiable as such, because (as above) the  statement  of  the
           account does not specifically identify the source of each credit
           entry.  Additionally, it is apparent from the above table  that,
           although there are monthly payments, the sums  paid  each  month
           are not the same, and the payments were not, in each month, made
           on the same day.  Nor was the same amount paid each month.   The
           sum of the 3 credit entries on 22 August 2017,  Rls  25,300,000,
           is approximately the sum stated  as  being  the  monthly  amount
           payable, Rls 25,392,444.  But it is difficult to  see  that  any
           other sum paid in any particular month after August 2017  is  or
           approximates to Rls 25,392,444.  The position is complicated  by
           this further point, namely  that  the  stated  increase  in  the
           pension of Rls 203,040 to Rls 25,392,244 per month  was  plainly
           not (as stated in the letter),  an  increase  of  12%.   If  the
           monthly pension of Rls 25,392,244 represented  a  12%  increase,
           the monthly pension before the  increase  would  have  been  Rls
           25,392,244�1.12 = Rls 22,671,646 and  the  increase  would  have
           been  Rls  25,392,244-  Rls  22,671,646  =  Rls  2,720,598.   By
           contrast, if the increase  in  pension  had  been  (merely)  Rls
           203,040 per  month,  the  monthly  pension  payable  before  the
           increase took effect would have  been  Rls  25,189,204  and  the
           percentage increase would have been (only) 0.806%.
            23.  On the basis that the increase took effect on 11 June 2017
           and that there were credit entries on the 12 and  15  June  2017
           (Rls 2,200,000 and 10,671,000),  those  credit  entries  are,  I
           conclude payments at the increased rate.  I  therefore  conclude
           that, during the 12 month period, there were 11 months in  which
           payments at the increased rate were made and 1 (16 May 2017)  at
           the lower (pre-increase) rate.  Taking the figures which I  have
           calculated in paragraph 22, the total payable over the 12  month
           period from 11 May 2017 would therefore have been as follows.
                 1 x Rls 22,671,646          Rls 22,671,646
                 11 x Rls 25,392,244         Rls 279,314,684
                 Total                  Rls 301,986,330
            By contrast, if the position was that the increase  which  took
           effect on the 11 June 2017 was of Rls 203,040 (and not 12%), the
           total for the 12 month period would have been
                 12 x Rls 25,392,244         Rls 304,706,928
                 Less 1 x Rls 203,040               Rls 203,040
                 Total                  Rls 304,503,888
           Whether the true position  is  that  the  increase  was  of  Rls
           203,040  or  12%,  the  total  of  the  actual   receipts,   Rls
           298,469,000 is approximately equal to, but slightly  less  than,
           the sum to be expected on the basis of the document to  which  I
           have referred in paragraph 15(a).  The evidence relating to  the
           pension payments is significantly less than satisfactory.   But,
           as against that,
                  a) The document to which I  have  referred  in  paragraph
                     15(a) indicates clearly, and I am satisfied, that  Mrs
                     M was entitled to a monthly pension,  which,  from  11
                     June 2017, was to be increased to Rls 25,392,444,
                  b) The statement of the account with Tejarat  Bank  shows
                     the above credit entries (albeit  that  the  statement
                     does not identify the source of the  credit  entries),
                     and
                  c)  The  total  amount  paid  to  Mrs  M's  account   (as
                     identified by Mr A) amounts approximately to,  but  is
                     slightly  less  than,  the  sum  which,  whether   the
                     increase which took effect in July 2017 was either Rls
                     203,040 or the 12%, as stated in the  above  document,
                     she should have received by way of pension.
           Paragraph 10(e) does not specifically require  that  the  credit
           entries in the relevant bank statement identify  the  source  of
           the relevant payment.  Although I  accept  that  permitting  the
           source of the relevant credit entries vouching  receipt  of  the
           pension payments to be  established  by  oral  evidence  (and  a
           fortiori oral evidence from either an  appellant  or  a  sponsor
           does not appear to be consistent with the  general  'regime'  of
           Appendix FM-SE (which, in general terms, requires that  receipts
           be vouched by independent documentary evidence), I do not accept
           that the Appendix prohibits the establishment of the  source  of
           the credit entries in the above manner (even though that is,  to
           a degree, dependent on Mr A's  identification  of  the  relevant
           credit entries).  It is unclear how he was able to identify  the
           particular credit entries as being payments of Mrs M's  pension.
           It is to be expected that there are other documents which  would
           have identified the source (if only because it is to be expected
           that, on making any  payment  to  Mrs  M,  the  Retirement  Fund
           Institute would have notified her in writing  that  the  payment
           either had been made or was about to be made and of its  amount.
           I am not satisfied that there are no other such documents  which
           could have been produced and which  would  have  identified  the
           source of each of the credit entries identified by Mr A as being
           the pension payments.  There is no apparent good reason (and  Mr
           A did not place any such reason before me) why  any  such  other
           documents (with appropriate translations) could  not  have  been
           placed before me.  There is no evidential basis for  concluding,
           and I am not satisfied, that  that  would  have  involved  undue
           difficulty or expense.  But despite my doubts (as above), in the
           light of what I have said in sub-paragraphs  (a),  (b)  and  (c)
           above, and because there is no specific requirement in  Appendix
           FM-SE that the bank statements should identify the source of the
           relevant credit entries and no  specific  provision  prohibiting
           the sources from being identified by oral  or  written  evidence
           from a sponsor, I conclude that the pension receipts  have  been
           established in the manner provided for by  paragraph  10(e)(ii),
           i.e. by the provision of
                 'at least one  personal  bank  statement  in  the  12-month
                 period prior to the date of application showing payment  of
                 the pension into [Mrs M's] account'.
           Since, consistently with paragraph 13(g)(ii) of Appendix  FM-SE,
           the gross annual income from a  foreign  pension  is  the  gross
           annual pension income received, my concern is  with  the  actual
           sum received, in the  circumstances  of  this  appeal,  the  Rls
           298,469,000.  I am therefore satisfied that the  pension  income
           during the relevant 12 month period was Rls 298,469,000."
           [my emphasis]


   13. Having made those findings, the Judge applied the exchange  rate  to
       the foreign pension and rental to reach figures of �4,045.11 for the
       rental receipts (Rls 230,400) and �5,240.20  for  the  pension  (Rls
       298,469,000).  Added to the Sponsor's  pension  that  gave  a  total
       joint annual gross income of �23,357.73.  Based on  those  findings,
       the Judge concluded at [25] of the Decision that the  Appellant  met
       the Rules in relation to the MIR by providing  "specified  evidence"
       that the Appellant and Sponsor were  in  receipt  of  the  requisite
       level of funds. The appeal was therefore allowed within the Rules.


   14. Mr Whitwell's submission was a short one.  In essence, he says  that
       paragraph 10 of Appendix FM-SE is clear - on  a  plain  reading,  it
       requires that the bank statement itself  shows  the  source  of  the
       credit entry.  As the Judge himself observed, the specified evidence
       regime is a strict one.  True it is that there is provision for some
       evidential flexibility. In particular in this context paragraph D(e)
       allows for  discretion  to  be  exercised  to  allow  an  evidential
       requirement to be waived or for alternative evidence to be  provided
       where a requirement cannot be met due to different  regimes in other
       countries - the Sponsor says that bank statements  in  Iran  do  not
       show source of credit as a matter of course.    The  difficulty  for
       the Appellant in this regard, though, is what the Judge says at [23]
       as recorded above about other possible documentary sources.


   15. As the Judge also observes,  the  general  tenor  of  the  specified
       evidence regime is  to  require  independent  documentary  evidence.
       Whether oral evidence is permitted is  something  which  has  to  be
       considered in context.  It might be so if,  for  example,  an  entry
       clearance officer  conducted  an  interview  with  an  applicant  to
       establish the content of documentary evidence which, taken together,
       was capable of showing that the requirement was met.  However,  even
       on the Judge's own findings, in this case, the evidence was not that
       of the Appellant but of the Sponsor.  As the Judge himself found, it
       was not clear how the Sponsor came to know the information which  he
       provided.  There is no formal witness statement from the  Appellant.
       Her own evidence could not be tested.  The  Judge  also  noted  some
       discrepancies between the documents and the explanation given.


   16. Mr Whitwell fairly  conceded  the  Rules  are  intended  to  provide
       guidance to caseworkers. However, the Tribunal is bound to apply the
       requirements in order to establish whether the  Rules  are  met  and
       therefore whether an  appellant  qualifies  in  a  certain  category
       within the  Rules.   Paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  of  Appendix  FM  clearly
       requires the "specified income" to  be  demonstrated  by  "specified
       evidence".  If paragraph E-ECP.3.1 is not met, then the requirements
       of E-ECP.1.1 cannot be met either as  that  provides  that  all  the
       requirements of E-ECP.2.1 to E-ECP.4.2 must be met.


   17. Whilst I  accept  therefore  that  there  is  no  express  provision
       excluding oral evidence, in circumstances where the general tenor is
       to require independent documentary evidence and where the Judge  was
       not satisfied that such evidence could not be provided (even if  not
       strictly in accordance with  paragraph  10  of  Appendix  FM-SE),  I
       conclude that  the  Judge  has  materially  misdirected  himself  by
       allowing the appeal under the Rules  on  the  basis  that  specified
       evidence had been provided.


   18. For those reasons, I set aside the Decision.  Mr  Whitwell  accepted
       however that the Respondent did not  take  issue  with  the  Judge's
       findings as to the substance of the evidence  considered.   Nor  did
       she challenge the Judge's findings as to other income, including the
       rental income from Iran.  I therefore preserve  paragraphs  [15]  to
       [23] of the Decision with the exception of  the  part  of  paragraph
       [23] which I have emboldened in the citation at [12] above and which
       includes the Judge's conclusions which were under challenge.


    RE-MAKING OF DECISION


   19. The effect of my  conclusions  as  to  error  of  law  is  that  the
       Appellant is unable to show by specified evidence that she meets the
       financial requirements of the Rules for entry clearance and as  such
       her appeal cannot succeed within the Rules.   No  further  documents
       have been provided to clarify  the  source  of  the  credits  as  to
       pension income.  Paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM has no purchase in an
       entry clearance case (in  comparison  with  the  position  where  an
       applicant seeks to remain).  That is  though  not  the  end  of  the
       matter. I still have to consider the appeal outside the Rules  based
       on Article 8 ECHR.


   20. I canvassed with Mr Whitwell the position as to  outcome  if,  as  I
       have done, I were to adopt the  Judge's  findings  as  to  what  the
       evidence  shows  (when  the  documents  are  taken  with  the   oral
       explanation).  He did not disagree that the effect of those findings
       is that the spirit although not the substance of  the  Rules  as  to
       financial requirements is met.  That he also accepted  is  pertinent
       to the public interest when I turn then to the only issue for me  to
       decide, namely whether the decision to refuse the Appellant's  claim
       is unlawful under the Human Rights Act 1998 as contrary to Article 8
       ECHR.


   21. As I explained to the Sponsor, if I were to allow the appeal outside
       the Rules, the Appellant would be granted the same period  of  leave
       to remain but on the "10-year route" to settlement rather  than  the
       "5-year route" which applies if  an  appeal  is  allowed  under  the
       Rules.  In other words, it would take her ten years to  qualify  for
       settlement.  The Sponsor was not unduly concerned about this.   Both
       he and Mr Whitwell were therefore  content  for  me  to  proceed  to
       consider the Article 8 case on the evidence before  me  and  without
       further submissions.


   22.  I  begin  by  noting  that  there  is  no  dispute  concerning  the
       genuineness of  the  relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  the
       Sponsor.  The only basis for the refusal of entry clearance was that
       the financial requirements were not met.  As such,  I  am  satisfied
       that there is family life between  the  Applicant  and  the  Sponsor
       notwithstanding that they have been kept apart  by  the  refusal  of
       entry clearance and  subsequent  appeal.   They  lived  together  in
       Northern Cyprus for about  seventeen  months  (from  November  2016)
       before marrying in March 2018 and making the application  which  led
       to the refusal under appeal.


   23. I am also satisfied therefore that the refusal  of  entry  clearance
       which has maintained the separation  of  the  couple  is  sufficient
       interference to require justification.  I was told  by  the  Sponsor
       that the Appellant is living in difficult circumstances in Iran,  in
       particular due to her age coupled with the  Corona  virus  problems.
       Although I have no evidence as to this, I do  not  consider  that  I
       require it.  The Appellant may  not  be  elderly  (she  is  aged  53
       years).  However, media  coverage  suggests  that  Corona  virus  is
       prevalent in Iran.  The Sponsor also told  me  that  he  has  health
       problems as is confirmed by some of the documents and he  is  living
       alone as his adult children live abroad.  He is aged 66 years.

   24. The main issue is therefore one of proportionality.  In  considering
       that issue, I take into account as I am bound  to  do  Section  117B
       Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  ("Section  117B").
       Certain of the provisions of Section 117B have no relevance in  this
       case - the Appellant is not in the UK and so there  is  no  need  to
       give any reduced weight due to her status here.  Nor are  there  any
       minor children involved.  In relation to the Appellant's ability  to
       speak English, that is not disputed.  It is though a neutral factor.
        Similarly, the  fact  that  the  couple  can,  on  Judge  Bennett's
       findings, maintain and accommodate themselves  without  recourse  to
       public funds is also neutral.


   25. In this case, the public interest is the  maintenance  of  effective
       immigration control.   I  take  into  account  of  course  that  the
       Appellant is unable to meet the Rules to  qualify  for  entry  as  a
       spouse.  She is unable to show by specified evidence that she  meets
       the financial requirements.  However, as I have already recorded, Mr
       Whitwell accepted that Judge Bennett's findings are that the  spirit
       if not the substance of that particular sub-rule is met.   Moreover,
       the Appellant meets all the other  requirements.   Accordingly,  the
       question is whether I am still required to give  significant  weight
       to the public interest due to the Appellant's inability to meet  the
       Rules.  I have concluded that  I  am  not.   I  accept  that  it  is
       relevant that the Appellant cannot meet the substance of the  Rules.
       However, it is also relevant  that,  apart  from  the  form  of  the
       evidence which she has produced to show that she  meets  the  Rules,
       she is  able  to  demonstrate  that  she  does  meet  the  financial
       requirements which is the only issue between the parties.  The joint
       earnings of the Appellant and the Sponsor,  as  a  matter  of  fact,
       based on the Judge's findings which I  have  preserved  and  on  the
       balance of probabilities, exceed the MIR by some margin.


   26. Balancing the interference with the family lives  of  the  Appellant
       and the Sponsor against that level of public interest, therefore,  I
       conclude  that  the  decision   to   refuse   entry   clearance   is
       disproportionate.  It therefore breaches the Appellant's  Article  8
       rights and is for that reason unlawful under the  Human  Rights  Act
       1998.

      DECISION
    I am satisfied that the Decision contains a material error  of  law.  I
    set aside the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  C  H  Bennett
    promulgated on 22 July 2019.  I preserve paragraphs [15] to [23] of the
    Decision save for the findings under challenge by  the  Respondent  (as
    emboldened at [12] above).
    I allow the Appellant's  appeal  on  the  basis  that  removal  of  the
    Appellant  would  breach  the  Appellant's  Article  8   rights.    The
    Respondent's decision is for  that  reason  unlawful  under  the  Human
    Rights Act 1998.


    The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).
