For the Appellant:     Mr Holmes, Counsel instructed by Ashwood Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer (2020)
      Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Egypt born in 1986.  He seeks protection
    in the United Kingdom.


 2. The Appellant claimed asylum on arrival at Heathrow Airport on the  7th
    April 2019. He asserted that he faced a real  risk  of  persecution  in
    Egypt for reasons of his political beliefs. In  particular  he  claimed
    that he had been sentenced in absentia  to  25  years  imprisonment  on
    false charges, brought against him because the authorities believe  him
    to be a supporter or member of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood.  The  charges
    relate to the Appellant's attendance at a demonstration  in  2014.  The
    Appellant accepts that he did go  to  that  protest,  and  that  he  is
    strongly opposed to the Egyptian regime,   but  denies  that  he  is  a
    member of the Brotherhood or that he  did  any  of  the  things  he  is
    charged with doing that day, such as preparing a Molotov cocktail.


 3. By her letter dated the 6th November 2019 the Respondent accepted  much
    of what the Appellant had to say.  It was accepted that  the  Appellant
    has  a  long-standing  involvement  in  politics  in  Egypt,  including
    organising for the election of Ayman Nour in 2005 and  ongoing  support
    for the al-Ghad party. It is my reading of the refusal letter (I return
    to this below) that the Respondent also  accepted  that  the  Appellant
    posted video clips of anti-government protests online  and  that  these
    were subsequently aired on al-Jazeera and other television channels.

 4. It was not however accepted that the Appellant had, as he claimed, been
    sentenced to 25 years in prison. The Respondent found  the  Appellant's
    evidence  about  how  he  came  to  know  about  the  sentence  to   be
    inconsistent; the documentary evidence he had  provided  had  not  been
    translated; further the Appellant had been in and out  of  Egypt  since
    the 2014 when the alleged  offence  had  been  committed,  and  it  was
    reasonable to think that if he was objectively at risk of  prosecution,
    or subjectively in fear of the same, that he would not have voluntarily
    spent time in the country during  that  period.  Asylum  was  therefore
    refused.

 5. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. His appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Handler  on  the  6th
    February 2020.  The Tribunal's written decision was promulgated on  the
    10th February 2020. The Tribunal in essence adopted the  reasoning  set
    out in the Respondent's refusal letter, as summarised at my  �3  and  4
    above. The case had developed since that letter in that the Appellant's
    documents had now been translated: the Tribunal noted that but declined
    to place any significant weight on  them  because  they  had  not  been
    verified. On a Tanveer Ahmed  assessment  they  added  nothing  to  the
    evidence overall.  The Tribunal further drew adverse inference from the
    fact that the Appellant denied having any convictions on his visa  form
    (the Appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom  in  possession  of  a
    visit visa obtained in Saudi Arabia), and from the fact that one of his
    five names - I do not think  I  infringe  my  own  anonymity  order  by
    identifying it as  'Ali'  -   is  spelled  differently  in  English  in
    different documents.  Finally the Tribunal had regard to  the  evidence
    regarding Facebook, but did not accept, in reasoning that I  return  to
    below in greater detail, that any of that placed the Appellant at risk.

 7. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.

 8. The Appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Permission was granted on the 13th  March  2020  by  Judge  JM  Holmes,
    sitting as a judge of the First-tier Tribunal.

 9. The matter came before me on the 27th November 2020.   For the  reasons
    that are set out below under the heading 'Error  of  Law',  I  set  the
    decision of Judge Handler aside. The matter has  come  back  before  me
    today so that I can 'remake' the decision  in  the  Appellant's  asylum
    appeal. For the reasons set out below under the  heading  'The  Re-made
    Decision' I have decided that the Appellant is a refugee as defined  by
    Article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention  and  so  his  appeal  must  be
    allowed on protection grounds.




    Error of Law


10. It is convenient that I address  the  grounds,  and  the  Secretary  of
    State's response to them, in turn. Before I do I address  some  general
    matters arising.


11. The first I allude to at my �3  above.    It  relates  to  the  matters
    placed in issue by the Respondent's refusal letter. The letter is dated
    the 6th November 2019 and followed the asylum interview  in  which  the
    Appellant was asked detailed questions about his claim. At paragraph 17
    of that letter the writer refers to the decision in Karanakaran  [2000]
    EWCA Civ 11 and explains that in her assessment the Secretary of  State
    will apply the guidance in that judgment,  setting  out  what  material
    facts  have  either  been  "accepted,   rejected   or   found   to   be
    unsubstantiated".

12. The first sub-heading under the section 'Material Facts  Consideration'
    reads "you were actively involved in the organisation of demonstrations
    against  the  government  regime".  There  then  follows  a  series  of
    paragraphs in which elements of the Appellant's evidence on this matter
    receive general consideration.  Paragraph 24 sets out  the  Appellant's
    evidence that he was a supporter of Ayman Nour; this  is  found  to  be
    detailed. Paragraph 25 outlines his  claim  to  have  helped  organised
    events  on  behalf  of   al-Ghad;   this   is   considered   reasonable
    notwithstanding the Appellant's denial that he was  a  member  of  that
    party. Paragraph 27 outlines his claim to have helped organise  various
    demonstrations; this  information  appears  to  attract  little  weight
    because it is "in the public domain". The matter  in  issue  before  me
    relates to paragraph 26.  Here  the  letter  recounts  the  Appellant's
    evidence that he had been "posting video recordings  of  the  protests"
    that had subsequently been aired by TV channels, but that he had closed
    that account because his  mother  was  worried.   He  had  subsequently
    opened another, private, account but had not produced any  evidence  in
    support of this claim.  Having set all of this out, the writer  of  the
    letter concludes:

         "28. Given the above it is considered  that  you  have  provided  a
         credible account in relation to this aspect of your claim,


         29. It  is  therefore  accepted  that  you  were  involved  in  the
         organisation of demonstrations against the government regime"

13. Before me Mr Tan was not prepared to  accept  that  the  concession  at
    paragraph 28 of the refusal letter extended to paragraph 26:    in  his
    view the writer had not intended to  accept  the  Appellant's  evidence
    about his Facebook activity. With the greatest of respect  to  Mr  Tan,
    that is a reading of the letter that I am unable to accept.  First,  it
    is clear from the structure of the decision overall  that  the  matters
    falling  under  the  heading  "you  were  actively  involved   in   the
    organisation of demonstrations against the government  regime"  are  in
    fact accepted. I say this not only because paragraph 28  says  so,  but
    because the rest of the Appellant's assertions, set out subsequently in
    the letter under other  sub-headings,  are  rejected  or  found  to  be
    unsubstantiated. Had the writer  intended  to  reject  the  Appellant's
    evidence about his Facebook activity, he plainly would  have  said  so.
    Second, whilst Mr Tan is quite correct  to  describe  paragraph  26  is
    being primarily a summary of the evidence, the same could be  said  for
    all the other paragraphs under this  sub-heading:   the  conclusion  on
    that evidence comes at 28.   Finally, the last  sentence  of  paragraph
    26, which refers to the Appellant's failure to produce any  documentary
    evidence, cannot assist Mr Tan, since it is  clear  that  the  decision
    maker had doubts about other aspects of the claim  -  for  instance  at
    paragraph 27 - which are nevertheless unambiguously accepted  as  being
    proven, on the lower standard of proof, at 28.  I  am  quite  satisfied
    that the decision maker treated  the  Appellant's  online  activity  as
    being part and parcel of his work  organising  and  promoting  protests
    against the Egyptian government, activity that he is accepted  to  have
    undertaken.


14. The second point to be made relates to materiality.  The  Secretary  of
    State has - quite understandably - taken the position that even if  the
    errors alleged are made out, it matters  not,  because  the  First-tier
    Tribunal made  other  significantly  adverse  findings,  which  do  not
    feature in the grounds.   I have taken these matters into account,  and
    I note that they are unchallenged. Whatever happens, the  finding  that
    the Appellant has been inconsistent about how he  found  out  that  his
    name was known to the authorities is preserved. So too the finding that
    the Appellant evidently felt safe enough to travel back to  Egypt  from
    Saudi Arabia in March 2016 and October 2017.  In any remaking  of  this
    decision those findings will stand. I am  not  however  satisfied  that
    either or both of those matters are  of  such  significance  that  they
    render all the points raised in this appeal  irrelevant.  Nowhere  does
    the Tribunal say so in  its  decision.  It  is  clear  from  its  self-
    direction, and indeed the reasoning, that the Tribunal weighed  all  of
    its findings in the round before it reached a  final  decision  on  the
    Appellant's credibility. The matters challenged herein cannot therefore
    be easily extricated from that global assessment.

15. Against that background, I address the matters raised by the individual
    grounds.



    The Documents


16. The Appellant submitted  two  key  documents,  written  in  Arabic.  He
    explained that they had been sent to him by his  lawyer  in  Egypt;  he
    provided certified translations. The first is what Mr Holmes  described
    as an arrest warrant. Its English translation more specifically  states
    that it is a "notice of arrest and summon  for  execution  of  criminal
    judgment with existence of legal  representative".    It  is  therefore
    what we might understand to be a bench warrant, albeit one issued after
    the case has been heard. It sets out the Appellant's name and  address,
    previous  address,  the  charges,  the  verdict,  the  particulars  and
    instructions to law enforcement officers to enforce  the  warrant.  The
    second document is much longer.  Mr Holmes described as the judgment of
    the court - the translation terms it the "verdict of the  court".   The
    original Arabic version runs to  three  and  half  pages.  The  English
    translation shows that it names the three judges who are said  to  have
    sat at the  Alexandria  Criminal  Court  Area  9,  the  prosecutor  and
    secretary. No lawyer was present for the fugitive defendant.  The  body
    of the verdict sets out the alleged events of the day and  specifies  6
    offences against the Appellant and a second defendant.


17. These documents were, at the date of the decision,  only  available  to
    the decision maker in Arabic (Mr Holmes tells me that translations  had
    in fact been submitted, but accepts that they do  not  appear  to  have
    made it  to  the  desk  of  the  decision  maker).   Consequently  they
    attracted  no  weight  at  all  in  the   Respondent's   deliberations:
    untranslated they might as well not have been there. It  was  therefore
    only when the HOPO on the day, Mr  Richardson,  began  to  probe  their
    veracity that the Respondent expressly placed  that  matter  in  issue.
    No criticism can be made of the PO, who was obviously  doing  his  job.
    Questions do however arise from the First-tier Tribunal's treatment  of
    these documents.

18. At its �28 the First-tier Tribunal says this:

         "Mr Richardson asked the appellant if he had considered having  any
         of the above documents verified and the appellant said that he  had
         not because he had been in Saudi Arabia not Egypt. That  answer  is
         not  satisfactory  because  it  does  not  provide   a   reasonable
         explanation. It could reasonably be  expected  that  the  appellant
         could make the necessary  arrangements  for  the  documents  to  be
         verified from Saudi Arabia. It may be that there are other  reasons
         why such a verification exercise has not  been  undertaken  however
         the answer that the appellant gave was simply that he did  not  ask
         an expert to comment on the authenticity of the  documents  because
         he was in Saudi Arabia. It would be reasonable for the appellant to
         have considered obtaining an expert opinion regarding the documents
         he has submitted. I find the answer given by the appellant for  his
         not having done this is undermining of the appellant's credibility"



(emphasis added).

19. The grounds, and the written submissions, go into some detail about why
    it was not at all reasonable to expect the Appellant to have instructed
    an expert witness whilst he was still living in Saudi Arabia.  For  one
    thing it may not have occurred to him that he needed to - he  had  been
    sent the documents from his lawyer in Egypt and  believes  them  to  be
    genuine; he is not himself an expert in United Kingdom asylum  law  and
    could not be expected to foresee that a year later he  would  be  cross
    examined about why he hadn't thought to get an expert to  look  at  his
    documents.   Those points are well made. The  Tribunal's  conclusion  -
    that the Appellant's credibility  is  generally  undermined  -  is  not
    logically drawn from the reasoning. It could rationally  be  said  that
    the lack of expert verification limits the weight  to  be  attached  to
    these documents, inasmuch as a positive verification would have greatly
    increased the weight due. It is not however, in my  view,  rational  to
    deduct weight in  the  way  that  the  Tribunal  has  apparently  done.
    Moreover the ratio of this passage reveals that  the  Tribunal  has  in
    effect required corroboration of corroboration, in itself impermissible
    in the context of asylum claims. It is trite protection law that asylum
    seekers should not be expected  to  corroborate  their  claims  by  the
    production of documentary evidence, and I am far  from  satisfied  that
    the expert evidence of a witness able to comment on the authenticity of
    these documents fell within  the  definition  of   'readily  available'
    materials of the sort discussed in TK (Burundi) [2009] EWCA Civ 40.


20. I am therefore satisfied that it was an  error  of  law  to  treat  the
    absence of  verification  as  positively  undermining  the  Appellant's
    credibility, a matter which in  turn  impacted  on  the  Tanveer  Ahmed
    assessment that the Tribunal purports  to  go  on  to  make.   In  this
    respect it is important to note that the documents themselves are found
    [at �32] to be "generally consistent" with the  Appellant's  claim  and
    "not inconsistent" with the background evidence: they are  nevertheless
    given "very little weight" because of the credibility findings  already
    made, and for the reasons I have found, made in error.
    The Appellant's Name


21.  The First-tier Tribunal draws adverse inference from the fact that the
    Appellant's name 'Ali' is in some of the material  spelled  'Aly'.   At
    paragraph 34 the Tribunal notes that  the  Facebook  account  uses  the
    spelling 'Ali' instead of the 'Aly' that  is  on  the  court  file;  at
    paragraph 36 of its decision similar observations are  made  about  the
    Appellant's degree certificate.


22. I am satisfied that this reasoning is perverse for  the  simple  reason
    that the Appellant's name could, quite innocently,  be  spelled  either
    way.  His name is an Arabic name, spelled in Arabic: ???. In  fact,  it
    is a name routinely mis-transliterated into English in that  the  first
    letter is not 'A' but the Arabic letter  ?  (?ain)  which  is  commonly
    described as a 'glottal stop' in English.  The final sound of the  name
    is the final form  of  the  letter?   ('ya')  which  can  variously  be
    pronounced 'ee' or 'ya', 'ye' or 'yi' depending on what vowel sound  is
    connected to it.  If  one  were  to  be  pedantic  the  name,  properly
    transliterated, would read  ?Al?,  the  small  'c'  preceding  the  'A'
    indicating that a glottal stop is required, and the long mark over  the
    'i' indicating an elongated vowel sound.  I  doubt  very  much  however
    whether adverse inference could be drawn from the routine failure to do
    so.    The nonsense  of  negative  conclusions  being  drawn  from  the
    'discrepancy' here is illustrated by paragraph  36  of  the  Tribunal's
    decision, where the Tribunal doubts the authenticity of the Appellant's
    degree certificate - a matter entirely unrelated to the case -  because
    the name is different  from  that  which  appears  on  the  Appellant's
    passport.   As for the Appellant's evidence that Facebook required  him
    to use one spelling over another, this is entirely unsurprising to  any
    user of social media: if a 'username' already exists, the platform will
    routinely suggest a variant.   I am not satisfied that either  instance
    could rationally justify adverse inference being drawn.


23. I find this ground  to  be  made  out.   Mr  Tan  did  not  defend  the
    Tribunal's reasoning on this point  but  asked  me  to  find  that  any
    irrationality was not material to the overall decision. In  respect  of
    paragraph 36 Mr Tan may well be right. There the  Tribunal  devotes  an
    entire  paragraph  to  the  Appellant's   degree   certificate   before
    concluding that the matter was not  "determinative".  In  fact  it  was
    entirely irrelevant. It is apparent however from paragraph 34 that  the
    Tribunal did materially draw adverse inference from the spelling  'Ali'
    on the Appellant's Facebook page: "[I] consider  that  there  is  doubt
    over whether it is in fact posts made by the appellant that  have  been
    submitted".  Two errors there  arise:  the  irrational  attribution  of
    weight to an immaterial matter, and going behind a concession of  fact.
    As I note at my �12 above, the claims as to the Facebook page had  been
    expressly accepted as credible by the Respondent.


    Facebook

24. That brings me to the final head of challenge, concerning the  findings
    on Facebook at �35 of the Tribunal decision.   The  key  conclusion  is
    this: "I find that the evidence of the  appellant's  Facebook  activity
    does not materially assist his claim,  taking  into  account  what  was
    already accepted by the respondent".   I read the latter comment as  an
    allusion to the point I have already  made:  the  Appellant's  evidence
    that he had previously had an active, open account on which  he  posted
    political  material  had  already  been  accepted  by  the  Respondent.
    Screenshots from that Facebook page appear in  the  Appellant's  bundle
    and show images of  protestors  and  commentary.    Why  it  might  not
    materially assist his account is rather more difficult  to  understand.
    If the Appellant had such an account, and as apparently accepted by the
    Respondent it was borne of the  Appellant's  genuinely  held  political
    beliefs, I would have expected some  analysis  of  whether  that  might
    place him at risk. Even if  the  entire  account  of  the  in  absentia
    sentence was a fabrication this  was  still  a  man  who  has  actively
    participated in activities against the  Egyptian  government,  and  has
    done so on behalf of groups politically allied  with  the  Brotherhood.
    That required a discrete risk assessment, one that does not feature  in
    the First-tier Tribunal decision.


25. The ground are not however  concerned  with  that  point.  Rather  they
    dissect the reasoning at �35 and submit it to be illogical and wrong in
    fact. For instance:

              i) "It is not clear which posts were  public  and  which  were
                 private". Before me Mr Tan and Mr Holmes  disputed  whether
                 as a matter of fact it was clear from  the  screenshots,  a
                 matter I am unable to comment upon.  I do not think I  need
                 to, for three reasons. First, the distinction was explained
                 in Appellant's evidence, and was indeed clearly highlighted
                 in  the  bundle.  Second,  if  the  Tribunal  thought  that
                 evidence  unclear,  it  could  have  sought  clarification.
                 Third, it is evident  the  earlier,  political  posts  were
                 public since that  is,  presumably,  how  the  video  clips
                 subsequently   aired   on   television   came   into    the
                 broadcasters' hands.


             ii) [it is unclear] "how large the audience was".  This is  not
                 relevant.  If  the  posts  were  seen   by   the   Egyptian
                 authorities, they were seen.  No part  of  the  Appellant's
                 case rested on his political views having been  seen  by  a
                 large audience.

            iii) "it has not been explained how the authorities  would  have
                 been able to access his Facebook posts, even if  they  were
                 publicly available". In granting permission  to  appeal  in
                 this case Judge Holmes  considered  it  arguable  that  the
                 First-tier Tribunal applied too high a standard of proof  -
                 this sentence typifies why. It is  not  clear  to  me  what
                 evidence  the  Tribunal  here  thought  should  have   been
                 produced.

             iv) "neither  has  he  provided  any  detailed  explanation  or
                 documentary  evidence  about  his  Facebook  account  being
                 blocked" . See above.

              v) "I find that the appellant  has  not  shown  to  the  lower
                 standard that he has a Facebook account that  was  publicly
                 available before 2016 and which contained posts which  were
                 reasonably likely to bring him  to  the  attention  of  the
                 authorities". See my �11 to 13 above: this was not a matter
                 in issue.


26. I am satisfied that the Tribunal's conclusions on Facebook  are  flawed
    for error of law and must therefore be set aside.




    Other grounds


27. At its �24 the Tribunal apparently  drew  adverse  inference  from  the
    Appellant's failure to explain why he couldn't get another job in Saudi
    Arabia. That was a matter entirely unrelated to his fear of persecution
    in Egypt and should not have featured in the reasoning.


28.  The final point raised in the grounds concerns the reasoning at �20 of
    the First-tier Tribunal decision. The  Appellant's  evidence  was  that
    following the protest in 2014  he  had  waited  three  days  before  he
    returned home, to make sure that he had not been  reported  to  police.
    The Tribunal did not think this a "reasonable explanation" for  why  he
    returned home. The Appellant challenges this  finding  for  a  lack  of
    reasoning. He does not understand why his explanation that he waited to
    check that the police  were  not  going  to  raid  the  house  was  not
    'reasonable'.   I find this ground to be made out. I do not  understand
    the reasoning myself, so I  accept  that  the  Appellant  is  similarly
    struggling.



    The Re-Made Decision

29.  In the hiatus between my 'error of law' decision and the appeal  being
    relisted the Appellant obtained the expert opinion  of  Mr  Hugh  Miles
    about his case.  Mr Miles is an Oxford-educated Arabist who  has  spent
    his entire career as a journalist and writer  working  in  and  on  the
    Middle East. He is married to an Egyptian and has lived in the  country
    since 2011. He has been producing written and broadcast  content  about
    Egypt for media organisations including The Guardian, al  Jazeera,  The
    Daily Telegraph, The Mirror, The Mail and the BBC since 2004.    He set
    up his own  consultancy  company  in  2010  providing  information  and
    consulting services about Egypt and other Arab countries  to  blue-chip
    clients  in  diverse  sectors  including  defence,  law,  finance   and
    manufacturing.  He  has   also   provided   consultancy   services   to
    multilateral organisations operating  in  Egypt  including  the  United
    Nations Industrial Development Organization and the United Nations High
    Commission for Refugees.   He is the founder and  editor  of  the  Arab
    Digest. I could go on, but it is not  necessary  to  do  so,  since  Mr
    McVeety accepted without hesitation that  Mr  Miles  is  an  expert  on
    matters relating to Egyptian politics and security, and that the report
    he has produced in this appeal is of a very high standard.


30. There are five main points to be drawn from the evidence  given  by  Mr
    Miles.

31. The first is that the human rights situation  in  Egypt  is  "generally
    dire". Mr Miles characterises Egypt as a "political volcano that  could
    erupt at any time", and that the regime is doing all  that  it  can  to
    suppress that explosion.  Wherever political opposition rears its  head
    the  regime  reacts  ruthlessly,  deploying  the  police  and  security
    officers who are able  to  act  with  impunity.   Human  rights  abuses
    continue to occur on a daily basis, with an estimated 60,000  Egyptians
    currently  imprisoned  because  they  oppose  the  regime.    Nor   are
    foreigners exempt - many journalists have been targeted  (including  Mr
    Miles) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office warn  tourists  visiting
    Egypt not to  express  any  open  criticism  of  the  government.  Many
    dissidents have fled the country.  Amnesty International have  recently
    produced a report detailing the torture of  children  as  young  as  12
    years old by members of the Egyptian  security  services.   During  the
    past  year  the  government  has  executed  perceived  opponents,  both
    formally and extra-judicially.  Before me Mr McVeety accepted that this
    was, as far as  the  Secretary  of  State  is  concerned,  an  accurate
    picture.  Nothing in Mr Miles' report is contradicted  elsewhere.   The
    bottom line is that  if  you  are  opposed  to  the  regime,  and  that
    opposition becomes known to the authorities, you are reasonably  likely
    to face treatment amounting to persecution including but not limited to
    arrest,  detention,  politically-motivated  prosecution,   torture   or
    death.


32. The second is that the regime's determination to suppress any political
    opposition extends beyond the boundaries of Egypt. Mr Miles refers to a
    recent case in  Germany  where  the  authorities  have  charged  a  man
    employed by Angela Merkel's press office  with  espionage.  The  German
    intelligence agency has reportedly found that part of his role  was  to
    gather information on Egyptians living in Germany, including members of
    the Muslim Brotherhood and Coptic Christians.  This monitoring includes
    social media. Mr Miles notes that the Appellant  says  in  his  witness
    statement that "if you post anything against the government,  you  will
    be detained and accused". Mr Miles' assessment  of  this  evidence  is:
    "this is essentially true".  He continues:

         132. I am aware from my work with defectors and dissidents that the
         Egyptian regime devotes considerable resources  to  spying  on  the
         opposition  abroad  using  both  signals  intelligence  and   human
         intelligence. The regime's intelligence apparatus and a network  of
         spies tries to identify dissidents in the Egyptian diaspora so that
         they and their families can better be targeted.


         133. Egyptian embassies  and  consulates  are  used  as  bases  for
         surveillance and  intelligence-gathering  on  opposition  political
         activities abroad. London is well known as one of the main  centres
         of exiled Egyptian opposition political activity.


33. Mr Miles includes in his  report  a  photograph  that  he  took  whilst
    covering a demonstration outside the  Egyptian  embassy  in  London  in
    2013: it shows a figure with a video camera  at  a  top  floor  window,
    filming the protestors below.  Hr further gives  examples  of  how  the
    Egyptian security and intelligence services seek to disrupt  opposition
    online  by  monitoring,  hacking  and  'doxxing'  perceived  opponents,
    including himself.  As  such  the  Appellant's  activity  on  Facebook,
    appearance on videos on YouTube and in particular the  reproduction  of
    this material by media outlets including al Jazeera  mean  that  in  Mr
    Miles' opinion "the regime probably has already identified him".


34. The third point made by Mr Miles follows from the above. This  is  that
    there is a particular, and long-standing, enmity between  the  Egyptian
    government and the Qatari funded channel al Jazeera.  The  network  has
    been consistently critical of President Sisi, and has given airtime  to
    prominent  opposition  activists  deemed  by  the   Egyptians   to   be
    "terrorists".  The government in Cairo has responded by  arresting  and
    prosecuting  al  Jazeera  journalists  and  contributors,  closing  its
    bureau, and banning the network entirely. Mr Miles  believes  that  the
    Appellant's historical 'open' Facebook posts place him  at  "some  risk
    today" but that the subsequent airing of his videos etc on  al  Jazeera
    increases that risk still  further:  "if  the  regime  regards  him  as
    helping a "terrorist" channel, he will be treated as a terrorist".

35. Against that background, Mr Miles considers the Appellant's account  to
    be wholly plausible.  His descriptions of  his  work  supporting  Ayman
    Nour accords with Mr Miles' own experience:  during that period he  was
    personally present at meetings that were disrupted by "NDP  thugs"  and
    witnessed the kind of small, and large, scale protests described by the
    Appellant.   His claim that the security services smashed up his  house
    is consistent with other cases known to Mr Miles, and importantly,  the
    chronology of his travel in an out of Egypt, found to be so damning  by
    the First-tier Tribunal, is said  by  Mr  Miles  to  be  plausible.  He
    explains that the regime does operate 'blacklists'  of  those  who  are
    wanted but that there is variability about  whether  those  charged  or
    convicted actually end up on such lists.  He draws on evidence from the
    2019 DFAT report on Egypt, as well as a consultation with  an  Egyptian
    lawyer, to confirm that it would  be  possible  for  the  Appellant  to
    continue travelling even after he had come to  the  regime's  attention
    during that period.

36. The final aspect of Mr Miles's evidence  concerns  the  court  document
    discussed at my �16-20: the arrest  warrant,  and  the  court  judgment
    against the Appellant. As I mention there, these  documents  have  been
    available to decision makers since early on in the process. There  were
    however several problems arising.  The  translations  provided  to  the
    Respondent were not linked to the file in time for them to be evaluated
    when the Appellant's asylum claim was assessed by the Home Office;  the
    First-tier Tribunal had found the lack of  expert  verification  to  be
    damning.  Today I have the opinion of Mr Miles,  but not  the  original
    documents which are assumed to be languishing in a  file  somewhere  at
    the Home Office. As Mr Miles explains, that has  given  rise  to  other
    difficulties:

         120. If these documents are genuine they are  very  significant  as
         they show the Appellant faces a life sentence in Egypt's  notorious
         prisons. However, I cannot give these documents full weight because
         I have only seen soft copies and I have not been able  properly  to
         authenticate them.


         121. The best and often  the  only  way  to  authenticate  official
         Egyptian legal documents like these is to check  with  the  issuing
         bodies in Egypt whether or not they are genuine. Only  an  Egyptian
         lawyer has any chance of being able to do this arduous task.


         122. If a foreigner like myself tried  to  pull  state  records  in
         Egypt I  would  be  stopped  by  security  officers.  The  Egyptian
         authorities would regard such an act as suspicious  or  hostile.  I
         would likely  be  arrested,  detained  and  deported.  State  media
         frequently warns the public about the threat of foreign  espionage.
         I have journalist colleagues and friends  who  have  been  deported
         from Egypt in the past or barred entry.


         123. Even for an Egyptian lawyer retrieving public records  is  not
         safe. Lawyers working on human rights cases have  frequently  found
         themselves being arrested and detained themselves,  assumed  guilty
         by association.


         124. At least sixteen lawyers are reported to  have  been  arrested
         since September 2019. Among those recently arrested and tortured by
         the regime is activist and writer Alaa Abd  El  Fattah.   When  his
         lawyer, Mohamed al-Baqer, who is also head of the Adalah Center for
         Rights and Freedoms, came to help him, he  was  also  arrested  and
         detained.
         125. In this case I  was  instructed  the  Appellant  was  strongly
         against the idea of a lawyer in Egypt attending a court in Egypt to
         check his documents because he feared for the safety of his  family
         in Egypt. This is a reasonable fear to have. The regime in Egypt is
         dangerous and generally best avoided. If a lawyer did try and check
         the Appellant's documents it is  possible  that  this  could  raise
         alarm bells with the authorities leading to the persecution of  the
         lawyer and / or other people involved in the case who are currently
         in Egypt (including me) or someone else close to the Appellant such
         as his friends or relatives.  The  regime  often  targets  people's
         families in lieu of the person they really want.


         126. The documents indicate the Appellant did not attend the  trial
         against him and so was tried in absentia. The Home  Office  refusal
         letter notes in paragraph  33  that  in  Egypt  in  a  trial  if  a
         defendant fails to appear and is subsequently sentenced in absentia
         they get a retrial. This is consistent with what I know  about  the
         Egyptian legal system. However it is important not to put too  much
         weight on Egyptian law because the regime usually does not  observe
         it. The law is simply a tool for targeting the opposition.


         127. The Home Office refusal letter paragraph 34 quotes  the  Egypt
         justice.com website as saying that the Egyptian constitution states
         an accused person is presumed innocent until  proven  guilty  in  a
         fair  legal  trial  in  which  the  right  to  defend  himself   is
         guaranteed. These are fine words but they have nothing to  do  with
         what actually happens in Egypt's military dictatorship.


         128. If the Appellant has been framed by the regime  and  sentenced
         to 25 years imprisonment and EGP 70,000 fine for violent crime  and
         involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood then in reality he  is  not
         going to get a fair and legal retrial on return.  Instead  he  will
         probably be tortured and could end  up  being  executed.  If  these
         documents are genuine, even though in  theory  he  is  entitled  to
         another trial because he was tried in absentia in  reality  someone
         who has  been  charged  with  political  crimes  and  suspected  of
         involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood has good reason to fear for
         their life upon return to Egypt.

37. For  these  reasons,  Mr  Miles  is  unable  of  offer  an  unequivocal
    endorsement of the documents. He is however able to say that  they  are
    prima facie genuine, and that they accord with what he knows about  the
    Egyptian justice system.


38. Drawing these strands of the expert evidence together in the context of
    this appeal it seems to me that it is unnecessary for  me  to  in  fact
    make a finding on the authenticity of  the  court  documents.  That  is
    because the Appellant has already demonstrated, to the  lower  standard
    of proof applicable in protection matters, that he  does  face  a  real
    risk of serious harm should he be returned to Egypt.

39. It is not in issue that the  Appellant  is  genuinely  opposed  to  the
    regime in Egypt. He has recently been involved in anti-Sisi protests in
    this country. Good quality colour photographs  and  'screenshots'  show
    him on such demonstrations in Manchester, and clips thereof  reproduced
    on the al Jazeera  YouTube  channel  in  August  2020.   I  accept  the
    evidence given by Mr Miles to the effect that the Egyptian  authorities
    maintain a keen interest in  monitoring  political  opposition  in  the
    diaspora, and that there is a particular enmity  between  the  Egyptian
    government and al Jazeera.  Mr  McVeety  acknowledged  that  Mr  Miles'
    evidence on this point was thoroughly researched  and  sourced.   I  am
    therefore compelled to allow the appeal by the following factors:

           a) A core protected characteristic of the Appellant is  that  he
              is vehemently opposed to the Sisi  government,  and  that  he
              seeks to express that political opposition  through  speaking
              out, highlighting abuses, attending protests etc.  He  cannot
              be expected to desist  from  those  activities  in  order  to
              remain safe.   The country background evidence indicates that
              those  who  openly  challenge  the  government  risk  arrest,
              prosecution and/or detention and ill treatment;


           b) He has, over a number of years, risked coming to the  adverse
              attention of the Egyptian authorities by  posting  opposition
              content online and having regard to Mr Miles' evidence I find
              that it is reasonably likely that such material has  come  to
              the attention of the Egyptian authorities who make a point of
              monitoring such material;

           c) The risk arising from (b) above is exacerbated  by  the  fact
              that material produced by, or involving, the  Appellant,  has
              been picked up and reproduced by al Jazeera,  with  whom  the
              Egyptian government has a particularly toxic relationship.

40. On those bare facts the Appellant  has  made  out  his  claim.   As  Mr
    McVeety acknowledged, even taking into account the  preserved  negative
    findings made by the First-tier Tribunal (see my �14 above),  and  even
    absent positive verification of the  Egyptian  documents,   this  is  a
    claim that succeeds.



    Decisions


41. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for error of law
    such that it must be set aside.


42. I remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by  allowing  the  appeal  on
    protection and human rights grounds.

43. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"
