                                  DECISION

       This is an application for judicial review of  the  decision  of  the
    respondent on 22 September 2017 (confirmed on administrative review  on
    25 October), to refuse an application for indefinite leave to remain by
    a citizen of Bangladesh, born 1983, and her husband,  born  1978,  with
    their two sons, S1, born 2003, and S2, born 2007, and  both  here  with
    her as her dependants since 2010.

HISTORY AND ISSUES

 2. The (main)  had arrived on a work visa,  and  in  2011  she  was  given
    further leave to remain as a tier 1  migrant, in due course till  2016,
    when she made a further application, in time, for indefinite  leave  to
    remain. That was refused, and her sons with her, on the ground that  in
    her 2011 application she had made a claim for earnings, later shown not
    to correspond with what she had declared to  HM  Revenue  and  Customs.
    This discrepancy had first come to light when she declared  it  on  her
    2016 application.

 3. The relevant figures were as follows, all rounded down to  the  nearest
    pound:

|                  | employed       |self-employed      |total  |
|                  |earnings        |earnings           |       |
|claimed to        |�15,600         |�27, 144           |�42,   |
|respondent        |                |                   |744    |
|declared to       |�15,600         |�5746              |�21,346|
|Revenue           |                |                   |       |


    The decision-maker noted the discrepancy between the total  figures  as
    being over �21,000; but, as counsel agree, it  is  more  meaningful  to
    look at it in percentage  terms.  On  that  basis,  the  applicant  had
    inflated her self-employed earnings to over 472% of  what  they  should
    have been, and her total earnings to over twice that.

 4. As part of the decision-making process on  her  2016  application,  the
    applicant had provided a letter from her accountants,  dated  15  March
    2017, giving her details  and  theirs,  confirming  their  position  as
    acting for her, and saying this, and no more:

       We also confirm that during the submission  of  the  tax  return  for
       2010/2011 the return was submitted by mistake with wrong information.
       However it came to tax payer notice and the return has  been  amended
       with the correct information on 1 February 2016. We have gone through
       the HMRC records of the client and observed that  HMRC  have  updated
       the return accordingly and [the applicant] has made  the  payment  of
       correct tax for the year 2010/2011.

       We further observe that because the return was submitted outside  the
       date she has paid interest and penalty on her tax.  We  also  confirm
       that as of today, the tax affairs are up to date with HMRC.

 5. Shortly afterwards, on 20 March, the applicant completed and returned a
    questionnaire, in which she gave the following answers to the questions
    put:

|   |   |question                        |answer                        |
|13 |   |(as to whether her tax return   |No. It was not correct. When I|
|   |   |for the year 2010 - 11          |found out this, I am amended  |
|   |   |accurately reflected her        |it.                           |
|   |   |self-employed income for the    |                              |
|   |   |year)                           |                              |

|   |(b)|                                |In 2015 when I re-checked my  |
|   |   |                                |returns.                      |
|   |(c)|                                |My accountants misplaced some |
|   |   |                                |documents.                    |
|   |(d)|                                |I immediately amended it.     |
|   |(e)|                                |Please see the attachments.   |


 6. This was how the decision-maker dealt (at p  4)  with  the  applicant's
    explanation for what had happened.  They  dealt  with  the  documentary
    evidence she said had been used  by  her  accountants  to  prepare  her
    return, and went on:

       Therefore since an accountant was used it  is  not  credible  that  a
       professional accountant would make  such  fundamental  mistakes  when
       declaring taxes to HMRC, as the accounts  would  have  been  prepared
       based on the evidence and information provided by you.  Nevertheless,
       having decided to work as self-employed in the United Kingdom, it  is
       your responsibility to ensure the correct declaration of earnings are
       [sic] made to HMRC at the correct time.

 7. The decision-maker went on to review  the  answers  the  applicant  had
    given, including, to question 10, that she had submitted her tax return
    in hard copy, as well as on line. They noted:

       ... you would have had sight of and signed your  tax  returns  before
       they were submitted to HMRC. The fact that you did not  notice  these
       errors before their submission is of concern and casts doubt on  your
       credibility and  on  any  self-employed  earnings  in  your  previous
       applications. Additionally, as stated earlier, your accountant  would
       have only based your tax returns  on  the  information  and  evidence
       provided by you ...

       [The discrepancy noted] does not demonstrate that your declaration of
       earnings to both [the Home Office] and HMRC are consistent.

       Had you declared earnings in your ... applications of 29  March  2011
       which were consistent with  your  initial  earnings  declarations  to
       HMRC,  you  would  not  have  scored  sufficient  points  under   the
       Immigration Rules for leave to remain to be granted.

       We are satisfied that, based on your actions in  initially  declaring
       different amounts of income to HMRC and [the Home Office],  you  have
       either misrepresented your earnings to HMRC in order to  reduce  your
       tax liability or provided false information about  your  earnings  to
       [the Home Office] in order to obtain leave to remain, or both.

 8. The decision-maker made it quite clear (at p  5)  that  they  were  not
    satisfied, for those reasons, that the earnings claimed  were  genuine.
    They had already set out the relevant basis for refusal under paragraph
    322 (5) of the Rules, which follows, headed:

       Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to  enter  or
       remain in the United Kingdom should normally be refused

       (5) the undesirability of permitting the person concerned  to  remain
       in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct  ...  character  or
       associations ...

    While there was no explicit spelling out of why  this  was  so  in  the
    applicant's  case,  the  facts  were  effectively  left  to  speak  for
    themselves.  The  issue  for  me  is  whether,  in  all  the   relevant
    circumstances of the present case, this was enough. There is a separate
    point about how the applicant's children were dealt with,  to  which  I
    shall return in due course.

ARGUMENT

 9. There is no controversy about the main requirements of  the  law  in  a
    paragraph 322 (5) case, and  no  need  to  burden  this  decision  with
    unnecessary references to authority on them.  The  decision-maker  must
    have been satisfied that there had been deception, or dishonesty on the
    part of the applicant: the only gloss put on this, by Mr Grandison, was
    that, if so, it would not matter whether  she  had  deceived  the  Home
    Office or HMRC, so long as  there  were  good  reason  to  believe  her
    guilty, one way or the other.  The  standard  of  review  is  the  very
    familiar  one  set  in  Associated  Provincial  Picture  Houses  Ltd  v
    Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1.



10. Mr Malik's case was based on what he  said  were  deficiencies  in  the
    decision letter: he did not challenge its account of what the applicant
    had done;  or,  as  she  said,  had  been  done  in  her  name  by  her
    accountants. However,  according  to  him,  the  decision-maker  needed
    explicitly to consider, and to decide  whether  or  not  she  had  been
    guilty of dishonesty. Perhaps the high point of Mr Malik's case on this
    head was what had happened on the administrative review application.

11. The applicant's case for administrative review had been put in this way
    (her solicitors repeated themselves rather, but this was  the  crux  of
    it):

       While it  is  the  case  that  different  information  was  initially
       declared  to  HMRC,  when  she  realised  the  error,  the  applicant
       rectified it as swiftly as she could and quite properly ensured  that
       her tax returns contained the correct information. Therefore we would
       submit that she was an honest  person  when  she  submitted  her  tax
       returns 2010 - 11 to HMRC or when she submitted her visa applications
       to [the Home Office].

       ... it was  her  accountant  who  made  the  mistakes  initially  and
       declared the wrong amount of income during the relevant tax  year.  A
       letter from the Accountant was submitted on 16  March  2017.  ...  if
       there was no dishonesty and it was simply oversights and/or  mistakes
       by her accountants which the applicant was not aware of,  then  there
       cannot be any valid criticism to the applicant.

12. The solicitors went  on  to  refer  to  the  administrative  provisions
    allowing tax returns to be retrospectively amended, and to  argue  that
    "The burden of proof of establishing this  allegation  (given  that  in
    essence it is an act of dishonesty) is on you: AA (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA
    Civ 773". In response to this point, the administrative review decision-
    maker said this, referring to that authority:

       Upon review the case law is  relating  to  deception  being  used  to
       obtain leave of some form in the UK. However, this case  law  is  not
       deemed relevant to your application as your application has not  been
       refused on deception but on character and conduct.

13. On that basis, it was maintained that the original  decision-maker  had
    applied the Rules correctly. Of course Mr Grandison  did  not  seek  to
    argue that the original decision letter could be defended in that  way.
    Mr Malik did argue that the terms of the administrative review decision
    showed that there had been a fundamental misconception about  what  had
    to be established on a 322 (5) refusal, not only in that decision,  but
    in the original one.

14. However, it seems to me that the merits, or otherwise, of the  original
    decision have to be  considered  on  their  own  terms.  A  fundamental
    misconception on the part of the  original  decision-maker  could  only
    have  been  cured   by   the   administrative   review   decision-maker
    reconsidering the case for themselves, and deciding  it  on  the  right
    basis. On the other hand, what if either there had been  nothing  wrong
    with the original decision in  the  first  place,  or  the  result  was
    inevitable, in terms of the Senior Courts  Act  1981  s.  31  (2A)  (as
    applied to the Upper Tribunal under s. 15 (5A) of the Tribunals, Courts
    and Enforcement Act 2007? It does not seem to me  that  it  could  have
    been made wrong, or the  result  less  than  inevitable,  by  what  was
    clearly enough  the  fundamental  misconception  on  the  part  of  the
    administrative reviewer as to the requirements of the law. So I go back
    to the argument on the merits, or otherwise, of the original decision.

15. It is of course common ground that the heading to this part of 322  (5)
    'Grounds on which leave ... should normally [my emphasis] be  refused',
    meant that the decision-maker had a discretion whether to do so or not,
    which they had to exercise. As already noted, it is also common  ground
    that they needed to be satisfied that there had indeed  been  deception
    or dishonesty, rather than mere inaccuracy, however careless. So  there
    is no need to go through  what  Mr  Malik  had  to  say  about  MA,  or
    Ministerial statements on the intended purpose of 322 (5).

16. Nor in my view is there any need for a detailed treatment of Mr Malik's
    (inevitably selective) references to cases  where  much  better-drafted
    decision letters have been upheld by the Tribunal or  the  courts:  see
    Kamal (JR 11417-16), Kayani  (JR 9552-17),  familiar  to  both  counsel
    before me, or Samant (JR 6546-16), all cases involving express findings
    of 'dishonesty or deceit'. Once again, the merits or otherwise  of  the
    decision under challenge have to be considered on their own terms,  and
    not as part of a sort of competitive examination.

17. The questions for me have resolved themselves into these:  whether  the
    original decision-maker was aware that

      a)      they needed to be satisfied of dishonesty or deceit? and

      b)      were entitled to be satisfied of it  on  the  evidence  before
         them, and if so

      c)      they had a discretion whether to grant or refuse  leave;  and,
         if the decision was wrong on either of these points:

      d)      whether it should nevertheless  be  upheld  under  the  Senior
         Courts Act 1981 s. 31 (2A).

CONCLUSIONS

18. I shall give my answers to questions (a) and (b), before going  on,  if
    necessary, to deal with the argument on  (c)  and  answer  that.  Going
    through the passages set out at 6 - 7, while the reference to its being
    the applicant's responsibility to check the earnings  declared  in  the
    return drafted by her accountants might suggest  that  the  writer  had
    carelessness  in  mind,  the  previous  passage  clearly  showed   they
    disbelieved her explanation about her accountants.

19. As the following passages made clear, it had been  she  who  had  given
    them the information they used; and either she must have misrepresented
    her earnings to HMRC, or to the Home Office. That was why the  decision
    was based on 322 (5), and not on 322 (1A), which  would  have  required
    the maker to be satisfied that it had been the Home Office who had been
    deceived. The decision-maker clearly did realize  that  dishonesty  was
    required, and did not need to reach a conclusion as  to  who  had  been
    deceived.

20. On point (b), it is necessary to refer to Shahbaz  Khan  (JR  3097-17),
    and the guidelines set out  by  Martin  Spencer  J  at  paragraph  137.
    Guideline (iv) makes it clear that the decision-maker  is  entitled  to
    consider the accountancy practice of having the tax-payer  confirm  the
    information set out, and the time for which they appear  to  have  shut
    their eyes to the falsity of it. (v)  requires  the  decision-maker  to
    consider the evidence on both sides (pointing  to  dishonesty  or  mere
    carelessness); but (i) makes it clear that a significant difference  in
    the amounts  declared  will  entitle  them  to  draw  an  inference  of
    dishonesty on the part of the tax-payer, where reasons  are  given  for
    the explanation not being accepted.

21. In this case the difference in the amounts was very significant  indeed
    (see 3), and the  explanation  of  carelessness  on  the  part  of  the
    accountants was very general: it remained unexplained  by  anything  in
    their letter of 15 March 2017 (see 4) just how  such  a  great  mistake
    could have been made. I have no doubt that in this case  the  decision-
    maker was fully entitled to be satisfied of dishonesty on the  part  of
    the applicant.

22. On the discretion point (c), it is true that there is no  reference  in
    the original decision (or for that matter  the  one  on  administrative
    review) to the existence of the discretion given by the use of the word
    'normally' in 322 (5): I do not think it was enough just to set out the
    terms of that paragraph. See Ukus  (discretion; when reviewable) [2012]
    UKUT 307, a statutory appeal, where what was  under  consideration  was
    the scope of review in such cases.

23. However, question (d) remains as to whether, in  terms  of  the  Senior
    Courts Act 1981 s. 31 (2A),  "... it appears to the court to be  highly
    likely  that  the  outcome  for  the  applicant  would  not  have  been
    substantially different  if  the  conduct  complained  of  [failure  to
    exercise that discretion] had not occurred.

24. On this question, Mr Malik once again resorted to comparison with other
    cases: in Kayani  the discretion had at least been acknowledged, and in
    Kamal considered, while neither of those cases, unlike  this  one,  had
    involved children. On the decision-maker's findings of  fact,  which  I
    have upheld, this applicant had  been  guilty  of  a  very  significant
    misrepresentation of her income, and I do not think  there  could  have
    been any possible basis for the exercise of discretion in  her  or  her
    husband's favour, if they were the only people involved.

25. The real question on this point is whether,  given  the  existence  and
    ages of the applicant's children, the  same  outcome  would  have  been
    highly likely. There was and is no information about them, beyond their
    names, ages and immigration histories. S1 was born on 7 December  2003,
    and S2 on 12 November 2007: both came here with  their  parents  on  13
    July 2011, and it follows that neither had been here for seven years by
    the date of the application, or even by the  time  of  either  decision
    under challenge.

26. There is nothing to suggest that either of the sons was  qualified  for
    leave to remain under any of the provisions of paragraph 276ADE of  the
    Rules, and so the question must be whether the undoubted  existence  of
    family life here between them and their  parents  made  it  other  than
    highly likely that the same result would  have  been  reached,  if  the
    discretion had been exercised. They were not entitled to the benefit of
    s. 117B (6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,  and
    needed to show exceptional circumstances, as explained in  Agyarko  and
    Ikuga [2017] UKSC 11.





27. The applicant herself might reasonably have been  expected,  given  the
    discrepancies to which she was admitting, to have made a  human  rights
    application for herself and her  family,  though  of  course  the  boys
    cannot be blamed for her failure to do so. The result however  is  that
    the evidence about them, before the decision-maker or me, shows nothing
    by way of exceptional circumstances at all. On that basis I consider it
    highly likely that, if discretion had been exercised in this  case,  it
    is highly likely that the result  would  not  have  been  substantially
    different. I note however that both boys have now been  here  for  over
    seven years, with the result that a human rights application  could  be
    made for them, with the benefit of s. 117B (6),  in  the  light  of  KO
    (Nigeria) & others [2018] UKSC 53.
