Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Al-Rashid, counsel instructed directly
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       RBL Prior (hereinafter referred to as the FTTJ).

    2. No anonymity direction was made by the FTTJ and I can see  no  reason
       for making one now.

    3. Permission was granted, and an error of law subsequently found on the
       basis  that,  primarily  the  FTTJ  fell  into  procedural  error  in
       neglecting to enquire whether the original documents  were  available
       prior to reaching a negative finding in relation  to  their  absence.
       Furthermore, he erred in his treatment of the evidence relating to an
       application for an  earlier  family  permit  made  by  the  sponsor's
       mother. The reasons are annexed to this decision.

    4. The matter came before me for a rehearing to  re-make  the  decision,
       with none of the findings of the FTTJ preserved.

    5. In advance of the hearing, Carlton  Law  Chambers  hand  delivered  a
       consolidated appeal bundle, which included the  material  before  the
       FTTJ as well as  up  to  date  evidence  relating  to  the  sponsor's
       employment and remittances sent to the appellant.

    6. I heard evidence from the sponsor, Mrs Khadija Khalife Mroue with the
       assistance of an Arabic-language interpreter whom she  confirmed  she
       understood. She was the only witness.

    7. The sponsor provided up-to-date  details  regarding  her  employment,
       hours of work as well  as  the  amount  of  funds  she  sent  to  the
       appellant in Lebanon. She works 16 hours per week as a cashier  in  a
       restaurant, Zyara, where she has  worked  since  February  2015.  The
       sponsor spends ï¿½100 month  of  her  income  on  the  support  of  the
       appellant, including  remittance  fees.  In  addition,  she  provides
       separate financial supports for her mother for a similar amount.  The
       sponsor's mother has an  outstanding  appeal  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal following a refusal of her application for a Family Permit.

    8. In response to Mr Al-Rashid's questions, the  sponsor  explained  the
       circumstances in which she had  taken  over  responsibility  for  the
       appellant's financial support. In essence, none of her other siblings
       who reside in the United Kingdom  are  in  a  financial  position  to
       provide the support the appellant requires.

    9. Mr Jarvis indicated that there was no dispute regarding  whether  the
       sponsor was a qualified person. His sole submission  related  to  the
       absence of corroboration of the sponsor's account that  her  siblings
       were unable to financially support the appellant. He argued that were
       I to find the sponsor's evidence to be credible, the circumstances of
       the appellant were such to meet the requirements set out in paragraph
       22 of Reyes [2014]  EUECJ  C-423/12.  Mr  Jarvis  accepted  that  the
       sponsor's evidence tallied with that of the appellant in her  witness
       statements. However, he considered that it was reasonable  to  expect
       there to be further evidence of  the  situation  of  the  appellant's
       other siblings in the United Kingdom. Mr Jarvis, conceded that  if  I
       was not with him in relation to his submission and decided to  accept
       the sponsor's account, in light of the test in Reyes, I would have no
       option but to accept that dependency met, pragmatically speaking.

   10. For his part, Mr Al-Rashid, reminded me that the relevant Regulation
       was 8 and not 7 as indicated by the ECO's decision. With regard to
       the lack of supporting evidence as to the position of the appellant's
       other siblings, he submitted that this went only to the motivation of
       the appellant and sponsor.

   11. Mr Al-Rashid argued that even if there had been a  deliberate  change
       of sponsor, in order to gain benefit from the EEA Regulations, it did
       not change the issue of dependency, which was  a  question  of  fact.
       There  was  no  authority  for  making  additional  enquiries   where
       dependency was clearly shown. It was a question of fact  whether  the
       appellant needed the sponsor's support for her  day-to-day  expenses.
       Even if there were someone else who could provide that support,  this
       does not change the fact that it is the  sponsor  who  is  doing  the
       supporting.

   12. At the end of the hearing, I indicated that I would be  allowing  the
       appeal on the basis that the ECO's decision  was  not  in  accordance
       with the law. My reasons are as follows.

   13. There was unchallenged evidence, which showed that  the  sponsor  had
       been sending funds to the appellant for a period of time, which  both
       preceded and post-dated the ECO's decision. The sponsor also produced
       current remittance receipts showing that she continued to financially
       support the appellant as at the time of the hearing  before  me.  The
       sponsor's evidence made it clear that the financial  support  of  her
       mother was a separate matter to that of the appellant.

   14. Furthermore, the sponsor provided a consistent, detailed and credible
       account as to the circumstances, which, firstly, led the appellant to
       require financial support and secondly resulted in the sponsor taking
       over the appellant's support from  their  brother,  Abbas,  who  also
       lives in the United Kingdom. On these matters, I have been guided  by
       what was said in Reyes [2014] EUECJ C-423/12 regarding the  necessity
       of the Member State assessing whether the appellant is or is not in a
       position to support herself from  her  own  endeavours.  Indeed,  the
       sponsor's evidence as to the effect the arrival  of  Syrian  refugees
       was having on  employment  opportunities,  for  people  such  as  the
       appellant, in Lebanon, was  plausible.   Furthermore,  there  was  no
       evidence before me to suggest that the appellant has ever been or  is
       likely to be in a position to support herself financially in the near
       future.

   15. In these circumstances, I accept that the  appellant  is  in  a  real
       situation of dependence upon the sponsor who is exercising her Treaty
       rights in the United Kingdom as a worker.

   16. The appeal  is  allowed  on  the  basis  that  the  decision  of  the
       respondent was not in accordance with the law.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision in its entirety  and  remake  it  by  allowing  the
appeal.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Rashid, counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      RBL Prior (hereinafter referred to as the FTTJ).


   2. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge Garratt on 7 July
      2015.


Background

   3. The appellant sought an EEA Family Permit in order to join her  sister
      (the EEA sponsor) in the United Kingdom as her dependant.

   4. On 16 June 2014, an Entry Clearance Officer  (ECO)  refused  the  said
      application on the basis that the sponsor was not a qualified  person;
      that the appellant was not dependent upon  her  sponsor  and  was  not
      therefore a family member in accordance with  "Regulation  7"  of  the
      Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

   5. The appellant appealed and in her grounds, she argued that the ECO had
      applied the wrong test of dependency; that documentary evidence of the
      sponsor's  employment  was  submitted  and  maintained  that  she  was
      dependent upon the sponsor.

   6. An Entry Clearance Manager (ECM) reviewed the decision to refuse entry
      on 3 December  2014,  however  the  decision  was  maintained  on  all
      grounds. The ECM  maintained  that  no  evidence  had  been  submitted
      showing that the sponsor was a qualified person or that the  appellant
      was dependent upon her. Reference was made to a visa submission report
      signed by the appellant, which was said to  show  the  nature  of  the
      evidence submitted with the application.

   7. The FTTJ did not accept that the  appellant  was  dependent  upon  the
      sponsor owing to what was  described  as  the  sponsor's  incompatible
      answers with the answers provided by Zahra Mohamad (the mother of  the
      appellant and sponsor) in her application for a Family Permit. Nor was
      it accepted that the sponsor was a qualified person as  there  was  no
      documentary evidence of her employment at the time of the hearing. The
      FTTJ commented that the payslips and P60 were not produced in original
      form at the hearing and there was no evidence by way of an  employer's
      letter or contract of employment.

Error of law

   8. The grounds of application argue, inter alia, that the FTTJ materially
      erred in failing to have regard to the  evidence  before  him,  namely
      remittance slips, which supported a finding  that  the  appellant  was
      dependent upon the sponsor.  It was said that the FTTJ  was  wrong  to
      rely on a statement made by the sponsor's mother in 2013  in  relation
      to an application made  6  months  later.  Post-decision  evidence  of
      continued employment was submitted with the application. It  was  also
      said that the FTTJ did not express any doubts regarding  the  payslips
      during the  hearing,  originals  of  which  the  sponsor  had  in  her
      possession.




   9. Designated FTTJ Garratt granted permission to appeal on the basis that
      the grounds were arguable; it was not clear that the  FTTJ  considered
      that the appellant's dependency on the  sponsor  was  later  than  the
      statement made by the sponsor's relative in her application and it  is
      arguable that cogent reasons were not given for rejecting the evidence
      of remittances.

  10. The respondent sent a Rule 24 response to  the  grant  of  permission,
      which was received on 16 July 2015. The respondent opposed the appeal;
      stating that the  FTTJ  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  there  were
      inconsistences;  that  dependency  had  not   been   established   and
      remittances did not establish dependency. It was  submitted  that  the
      sponsor had failed to provide adequate evidence of her employment  and
      no material error of law was  established  by  providing  more  cogent
      evidence after the hearing.

The hearing

  11. At the hearing before me, Mr Jarvis conceded that the FTTJ  materially
      erred in relation to the way the evidence of the  application  of  the
      sponsor's mother was addressed as well as the  fundamental  unfairness
      in not requesting the sponsor's original documents  and  then  drawing
      adverse conclusions from their absence. Mr  Rashid,  who  was  counsel
      before the FTTJ, confirmed that the sponsor had not been asked to show
      the original payslips.


  12. I conclude that the FTTJ made a material error of  law.  The  parties'
      mother applied for a family permit in November 2013 and  according  to
      the application form, she stated that the sponsor was  not  supporting
      anyone else. The FTTJ considered this to conflict with the appellant's
      application for a family permit, on the basis  of  dependency  on  the
      same sponsor, made six months later and after she says that she was no
      longer dependent on the sponsor's brother who is a British citizen  in
      the United Kingdom.

  13. The FTTJ's reliance on the apparent lack of original payslips, without
      making any prior enquiry, is clearly procedurally unfair.

  14. I therefore set aside the decision of the FTTJ  in  its  entirety  and
      preserve none of his findings.

  15. The sponsor attended the hearing and an interpreter had  been  booked.
      Accordingly, there ought to have been no reason why I could  not  have
      proceeded to remake the decision. Regrettably, the Arabic  interpreter
      did not attend the hearing centre and nor had any  communication  been
      received from him. Upon my clerk making enquiries, it transpired  that
      the interpreter had an urgent appointment elsewhere. As it  was  close
      to 3pm when this information was received, the prospect  of  obtaining
      the services  of  an  alternative  interpreter  seemed  remote  and  I
      therefore adjourned the appeal until 2pm on 23  October  2015  when  I
      would be sitting again.

  16. No anonymity direction was made by the FTTJ and I can  see  no  reason
      for making one now.


Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.

The FTTJ's decision is set aside.


Directions

The continuance hearing is to be heard by DUTJ Kamara on 23 October 2015  at
2pm.
The time estimate is 1.5 hours.
An Arabic (Middle Eastern dialect) interpreter is required.
