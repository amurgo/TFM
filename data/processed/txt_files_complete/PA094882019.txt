For the Appellant:     Ms Saifolahi, Counsel instructed by Makka Solicitors
Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS




 1. The  Appellant  is  a  national  of  Afghanistan  born  in  1974.   His
    dependents are his wife and six children.   He appeals with  permission
    against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Trent)  to
    dismiss his appeal on protection and human rights grounds.




    Background and Matters in Issue

 2. The Appellant claimed asylum on arrival in the United  Kingdom  on  the
    18th May 2019. The basis of his claim was that he  had  a  well-founded
    fear of persecution in Afghanistan for reasons of his imputed political
    opinion. The Appellant averred that he had worked as a supervisor at  a
    firm with a contract with the Afghan government and that as a result he
    had received death threats, both direct and indirect, from the Taliban.
       Fearing  assassination  the  Appellant  sold  his  home   and   fled
    Afghanistan with his family.

 3. The First-tier  Tribunal  found  the  Appellant's  account  to  contain
    material inconsistencies such that his evidence could not  be  accepted
    as true, even to the lower standard of proof.  It rejected his evidence
    that he had worked as a contractor, or that he had been  threatened  by
    the Taliban. It found there to be no risk of harm to the  Appellant  in
    his  home  city  of  Kandahar.   The  Tribunal  further  rejected   the
    Appellant's claim to have sold his home and  so  to  face  destitution.
    It noted in this regard that his parents  and  brother  all  remain  in
    Kandahar and found that he could  look  to  these  family  members  for
    support.  The protection appeal was dismissed on this basis.

 4. In respect of the Appellant's human rights  the  Tribunal  acknowledged
    his claim that it would be a  disproportionate  interference  with  his
    Article 8 rights to refuse to grant him leave. Under this  heading  the
    Tribunal considered the best interests of the children, and found these
    to be that they remain with their parents.  It then considered  whether
    the Appellant or his wife could meet the relevant test under  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of  the  Rules:   it  found  that  there  were  not  very
    significant obstacles to their integration in Afghanistan.   They  both
    have family there, speak the language and are familiar with the culture
    and operation of society.  The Appellant could  work  there.   On  that
    basis they could not succeed on Article 8 grounds with reference to the
    Rules.  The  Tribunal  went  on  to   consider   whether   there   were
    circumstances 'outside of the rules' such that would render removal  of
    this family disproportionate and finding there to  be  none,  dismissed
    the appeal on human rights grounds.

 5. On the 9th January 2020 the Appellant was granted permission to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal on three discrete grounds:

      i) In respect of  the  protection  claim  it  is  submitted  that  the
         decision is vitiated for unfairness, the Tribunal  having  declined
         to adjourn proceedings so as to enable the Appellant's wife to give
         oral evidence;

     ii) In respect of the claim to humanitarian  protection  the  Appellant
         submits that the Tribunal failed to  take  material  evidence  into
         account such that would demonstrate that Kabul was not a  place  of
         safety and/or that it would be unreasonable to expect  this  family
         to relocate there;

    iii) In respect of the human rights claim it is further averred that the
         Tribunal erred in failing to take material country background  into
         account in its assessment of the "very significant obstacles" test.

 6. At a hearing on the 6th March 2020 I heard submissions from the parties
    on the merits of the appeal. There has since then been a delay  in  the
    promulgation of this decision for which the parties have my  apologies.
    I was on leave immediately after the hearing and I was then  unable  to
    return to Field House because of the measures taken to combat Covid-19.
     Having now had the file returned to me I confirm that  it  contains  a
    full note of the submissions made by the parties such that I am able to
    determine the appeal.     I note  that  since  the  hearing  the  Upper
    Tribunal  has  promulgated  its  decision  in  AS  (Safety  of   Kabul)
    Afghanistan CG [2020] 00130 (IAC).   Given that the matter before me is
    confined to whether the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  flawed
    for any material error of law I have not had regard to that decision in
    my deliberations.




    Ground (i): the Failure to Adjourn

 7. It is submitted on the Appellant's behalf that he had applied  for  the
    First-tier Tribunal hearing to be adjourned so that his wife could have
    given crucial evidence. She was able to corroborate his claim  to  have
    worked for the company in question, and could further  testify  to  the
    threats received from the Taliban.  It is submitted that the First-tier
    Tribunal acted unfairly in refusing to grant that adjournment request.

 8. The Tribunal's decision acknowledges that  an  adjournment  application
    was made, and sets out the reasons why it was refused [at FTT ï¿½24]:

         "The Appellant applied to adjourn the hearing on the ground that no
         witness evidence had been produced from his wife.  He  acknowledged
         that he had previously instructed his representatives that she  was
         not able to give evidence as a result of stress, but  his  position
         was now that she could do so if it was sufficiently  important.  He
         was unable to clarify whether her  evidence  was  likely  to  cover
         issues not already covered  in  his  two  witness  statements.  The
         Respondent had refused the Appellant's claim on 18  September  2019
         and the Appellant had not raised this issue at  a  Case  Management
         Review Held on 22nd October 2019. No  written  statement  had  been
         prepared by his wife. I declined to  adjourn  the  proceedings.  In
         light of the  procedural  history  failure  to  prepare  a  written
         statement and the Appellant's previous comments as  to  his  wife's
         inability to give evidence I  considered  that  he  had  had  ample
         opportunity to adduce  evidence  from  his  wife  and  without  any
         suggestion that her evidence would go beyond that  already  covered
         in his own statements, I considered that it would be fair and just,
         considering the overriding objective, to proceed to hear the  claim
         on the evidence before me".

 9. Ms Saifolahi candidly accepted that many of  the  Judge's  observations
    here were true. There had been plenty of time to proof the  Appellant's
    wife, and to advise that she was to give evidence. She  explained  that
    the lady in question was believed to be suffering  from  Post-Traumatic
    Stress Disorder and that as a result those instructing Ms Saifolahi had
    not thought it appropriate to take a statement from her.  It  was  only
    when Ms Saifolahi herself met with the family at court, on the  morning
    of the hearing, that she advised that it would have been better to have
    had the additional evidence adduced.   In  respect  of  the  overriding
    objective Ms Saifolahi agreed that this was an important  consideration
    for the judge but pointed out that she was only seeking  a  very  short
    adjournment - this was not a matter which  had  been  affected  by  any
    delay thus far and the Respondent would have suffered no prejudice.

10. Mr Tan submitted that it was  inappropriate  for  Ms  Saifolahi  to  be
    telling me what had happened at the hearing. If  she  wanted  to  be  a
    witness she should have prepared a witness statement and the  Appellant
    should have different counsel: BW  (witness  statements  by  advocates)
    Afghanistan [2014] UKUT 00568 (IAC).   Mr Tan stressed that  there  had
    been plenty of time for the Appellant to prepare his case, and that the
    evidence from his wife had always been available.

11. The 'overriding objective' is  set  out  at  Rule  2  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008:  "the  overriding  objective  of
    these Rules is to enable the Upper Tribunal to deal with  cases  fairly
    and justly". The rule explains that dealing  with  a  case  fairly  and
    justly includes

    (a)  dealing with the case in  ways  which  are  proportionate  to  the
         importance  of  the  case,  the  complexity  of  the  issues,   the
         anticipated costs and the resources of the parties;

    (b)  avoiding unnecessary formality  and  seeking  flexibility  in  the
         proceedings;

    (c)  ensuring, so far as practicable, that  the  parties  are  able  to
         participate fully in the proceedings;

    (d)  using any special expertise of the Upper Tribunal effectively; and



    (e)  avoiding delay, so far as compatible with proper consideration  of
         the issues

12. In Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT  00418  (IAC)  the  then
    President Mr Justice McCloskey held that the focus for any review of  a
    decision to refuse an adjournment was whether the aggrieved  party  had
    been deprived of a fair hearing:

         "If a Tribunal refuses to accede to an  adjournment  request,  such
         decision could, in  principle,  be  erroneous  in  law  in  several
         respects: these include a failure to take into account all material
         considerations; permitting immaterial  considerations  to  intrude;
         denying the party concerned a fair hearing; failing  to  apply  the
         correct test; and acting irrationally.  In practice, in most  cases
         the question will be whether  the  refusal  deprived  the  affected
         party of his right to a fair hearing.  Where an adjournment refusal
         is challenged on fairness grounds, it  is  important  to  recognise
         that the question for the Upper Tribunal is  not  whether  the  FtT
         acted reasonably.   Rather,  the  test  to  be  applied  is  that
         of fairness:   was  there  any  deprivation   of   the   affected
         party's right to a fair hearing? See SH (Afghanistan) v Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 1284".

13. I deal first with Mr Tan's submission that the  manner  in  which  this
    ground has been advanced was inappropriate. Whilst  Mr  Tan  was  quite
    right to bring my attention to the principles in BW (Afghanistan) I  am
    not satisfied that they need to be  applied  here.  The  fact  that  an
    adjournment application had been made, and the reasons for it, are  all
    set out in the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  nothing  Ms
    Saifolahi told me goes beyond those facts. The principals  in  BW  have
    important application where some dispute has arisen about what happened
    in court, but that is not the case here.

14. Turning to the reasons given by the First-tier  Tribunal  for  refusing
    the adjournment I  agree  with  Ms  Saifolahi  that  at  least  one  is
    difficult to understand.   The  Tribunal  explained  that  it  was  not
    prepared to wait to hear evidence from the Appellant's wife because she
    would only  be  covering  the  same  ground  as  he  had  done  in  his
    statements. As Ms Saifolahi submits, the point of the  wife's  evidence
    was to corroborate what her husband had said, not to expand upon it: it
    is possible that the wife's evidence could therefore have added  weight
    to the Appellant's case.

15. I am not however satisfied, having regard to the full reasoning of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, that the Appellant was in any way deprived of  his
    right to a fair  hearing.   That  is  because  it  is  clear  from  the
    reasoning at ï¿½33-40  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  that  the
    'missing' evidence would have had little to no impact  upon  the  final
    decision. Let us assume for the sake of argument that  the  Appellant's
    wife averred that her husband was employed  by  the  contractor  as  he
    claimed (this being the primary issue that she could speak to).  It  is
    very difficult to see how her  confirmation  of  her  husband's  claims
    would have gone any way to meeting the Tribunal's concerns. The account
    of the Appellant working for a contractor  with  links  to  the  Afghan
    government  was  fundamentally  contradicted  by  the  information   he
    provided to an Entry Clearance Officer in 2013.  Applying  for  a  visa
    then he said that he ran his  own  business,  and  presumably  produced
    evidence to that effect.  His connection with the  contractor  was  not
    even mentioned in his screening interview, when he was asked to lay out
    the basis of his claim: he then told an immigration officer that he was
    a property dealer who also sold cooking wares. The explanation  offered
    by the Appellant for these discrepancies made no sense to the Tribunal,
    since it did not accord with the chronology: the application for  entry
    clearance was made in 2013 and yet the claimed threats  did  not  start
    until 2015. The Tribunal further noted that  there  was  a  significant
    delay in the family leaving the country after the threats were said  to
    have been made, and there  were  other  discrepancies  in  the  account
    given. Having had regard to all of that I cannot be satisfied that  the
    additional weight that the Appellant's wife could  have  added  to  his
    claim - even taken at its  highest  -  would  have  made  any  material
    difference to the outcome of this appeal.

16. I would further note that the Tribunal was entitled, in its refusal  of
    the adjournment application, to have had regard to the  fact  that  the
    Appellant  had  been  represented  throughout,  and   had   had   ample
    opportunity to submit evidence from his wife. The explanation  for  the
    decision not to draft a statement from her was that she  was  suffering
    from 'stress', or as Ms Saifolahi put it to  me,  PTSD.  There  was  no
    medical evidence adduced to support that contention and  I  would  note
    that  the  Appellant  himself  was  deemed  able   to   give   evidence
    notwithstanding his own stress,  which  he  refers  to  in  his  asylum
    interview [at Q50] as well as in his statement [at  ï¿½6].  In  fact  the
    reason for the late change in tack was simply this: that Counsel took a
    different view from those instructing her.  The Tribunal was  entitled,
    having regard to the overriding objective, to have regard to that  case
    history when considering whether it would be just and fair to adjourn.




    Ground (ii): Kabul

17. At the date that the First-tier Tribunal heard the appeal in this  case
    the country guidance was in flux.   Although  the  Upper  Tribunal  had
    promulgated the decision in AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG  [2018]
    UKUT 118 (IAC) by the time that the matter came before Judge  Trent  in
    December, the Court of Appeal had, on the 24th May  2019,  handed  down
    judgment in  AS  (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2019] EWCA Civ 873 in which it had quashed the decision  of
    the UT and  remitted  it  for  further  consideration.   The  Appellant
    submits that  in  its  approach  to  the  prevailing  country  guidance
    conditions the First-tier Tribunal here failed to have  regard  to  the
    fact that the UT decision in AS had been quashed,  and  the  Court  had
    ordered the decision to be remade. As such the extant country  guidance
    was AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 163.  It  is  further
    submitted that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  have  regard  to
    specific country background material, including the most  recent  UNHCR
    guidelines, which demonstrated that the conditions there  had  worsened
    since that last consideration by the UT.  The Appellant avers  that  he
    had specifically asked the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  depart  from  the
    country guidance, and that his submissions had  required  consideration
    which, on his submission, they did not receive.

18. In response Mr Tan questioned whether the latter  submission  had  been
    made. He pointed to the Skeleton Argument  that  had  been  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and noted that it said nothing about departing from
    the findings in AS (Safety of Kabul) or indeed AK (Article  15(c)).  He
    further submitted that it is evident that the First-tier  Tribunal  did
    have regard to the  materials  mentioned  in  the  grounds:  the  UNHCR
    guidelines are for instance referred to at its ï¿½48. There  was  nothing
    to suggest that  the  Appellant  and  his  family  had  any  particular
    vulnerability which might expose them to a greater degree of risk  than
    any other civilians in Afghanistan.

19. At its ï¿½12 the First-tier Tribunal says this:

         "As to the risk on return to Afghanistan generally in the sense  of
         Article 15(c) of the Qualification  Directive  I  have  taken  into
         account the guidance in AK (Article 15(c))  Afghanistan  CG  [2012]
         UKUT 163 to the effect the  level  of  indiscriminate  violence  in
         Afghanistan, taken as a whole, and  even  in  the  provinces  worst
         affected by violence, is not at such a level  as  to  mean  that  a
         civilian faces a real risk within  the  meaning  of  Article  15(c)
         solely  by  being  present  in  the  country.   That  guidance  was
         specifically preserved by the  Upper  Tribunal  in  AS  (Safety  of
         Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT 118, is not affected by the Court
         of Appeal's remission of part of the decision in AS  to  the  Upper
         Tribunal, and it was not argued before me that  it  should  not  be
         followed. The argument before me related to the  viability  of  the
         internal relocation to Kabul, a question to which I return  briefly
         below".

20. That direction is somewhat perplexing. First, I am not clear  what  the
    First-tier Tribunal meant by its comment  that  the  UT's  guidance  on
    Article 15(c) was not affected by the Court of Appeal decision  in  AS.
    Insofar as the conditions in Kabul were concerned, the Court's decision
    expressly quashed the UT's findings on Article 15(c), based as they had
    been on a fallacious recording of the statistics.    The  position,  at
    the date of the appeal, was that AK continued  to  apply,  but  it  was
    incumbent upon the Tribunal to examine the up to  date  evidence  about
    conditions on the ground to see if anything had  changed.  Second,  the
    note that the argument in the  appeal  had  been  concerned  only  with
    internal flight to Kabul is  inexplicable.  If  one  accepts  that  the
    family's 'home area' for the purpose of  the  protection  analysis  was
    Kandahar, there would have to be a finding  of  risk  pertaining  there
    before internal flight to Kabul would be at all  relevant.  I  note  in
    this regard the somewhat conflicting evidence  on  this  matter  -  the
    Appellant himself states that he was a resident of Kabul: if  that  its
    indeed the case then the question of internal flight to  the  city  had
    even less application.

21. That said, I can find no material error  in  the  UT's  approach.   Its
    overall credibility findings on the Appellant's account of  persecution
    are detailed, cogent and unimpeachable. Its findings on  Article  15(c)
    were plainly open to it on the evidence. Even if I am wrong about that,
    there would be no benefit to the Appellant in having  this  element  of
    the appeal remade, since the applicable country guidance is  today  the
    decision in AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan  CG  [2020]  00130  (IAC),
    which conclusively finds that Article 15(c) is not engaged in the city.
       I can see nothing in the personal  characteristics  of  this  family
    which might give risk to any enhanced Elgafaji risk.




    Ground (iii): very significant obstacles

22. As regards the Article 8  private  life  test,  set  out  at  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules, Ms Saifolahi submitted that the
    Tribunal had failed in its  assessment  of  whether  there  were  "very
    significant obstacles" to the family's integration in  Afghanistan,  to
    consider the prevailing security situation and the  country  background
    materials to which she referred in her submissions on ground (ii).

23. There is no merit in this submission.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  gives
    specific consideration to the family's circumstances on return  at  its
    ï¿½50, where it notes that close family members continue to work and live
    in Kandahar, and that these relatives could assist  the  Appellant  and
    his family with any practical needs that they might  have.  As  to  the
    Appellant's ability to integrate, it was of course the case that he had
    lived in Afghanistan all of his life, and at the  date  of  the  appeal
    before the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  only  very  recently  left  that
    country. It would have been perverse to conclude that he would have any
    difficulty at all in re-establishing a private life for himself there.




    Anonymity Order

24. This appeal concerns a claim for protection involving children.  Having
    had regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity  Orders
    I therefore consider it appropriate to make an order in  the  following
    terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decision

25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material  error  of
    law and it is upheld.  The appeal is dismissed.

26. There is an order for anonymity.
