Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Brocklesby-Weller
For the Respondent:    Not represented


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent is a national  of  Guyana,  born  24  July  1982.  In  a
    decision of 9 November 2015 the First-tier Tribunal allowed his  appeal
    against a decision of the SSHD, made on 4 March 2015, refusing to  vary
    his leave and setting directions for his removal pursuant to section 47
    of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The SSHD appeals to the Upper Tribunal with the permission of FtT Judge
    Parks dated 21 April 2016.

 3. It transpires that the respondent left the country on 27  August  2015,
    after lodging his appeal before the FtT but before the FtT's decision.

 4. As a consequence,  the  respondent's  appeal  fell  to  be  treated  as
    abandoned as of 27 August 2015, pursuant to the operation  of  s.104(4)
    of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2002 (as it was prior to
    amendment by SI 2771 of 2014).

 5. The First-tier Tribunal's decision must therefore be set aside  because
    it had no jurisdiction to determine the appeal, there  being  no  valid
    appeal before it on 9 November 2015. This conclusion also  disposes  of
    the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal.
