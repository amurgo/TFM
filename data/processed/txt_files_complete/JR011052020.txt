                                    ORDER

      ___________________________________________________________________



UPON the fact-finding hearing on the  Claimant's  application  for  judicial
review held on 15th  -  18th  December  2020  before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
Rimington.

AND UPON hearing Ms Benfield for  the  Claimant  and  Mr  Holbrook  for  the
Defendant.

AND UPON Clare Montgomery QC having granted permission on  5  December  2019
and making no order as to costs.

IT IS DECLARED that the Defendant's date of birth  is  12th  March  2000  so
that when he presented to the Defendant in July 2019, he  was  19  years  of
age.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

   1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.



   2. The order for interim relief made  on  7th  November  2019  is  hereby
      discharged.



   3. Save for the costs order made on 5 December 2019 (which was 'no  order
      for costs') the Claimant is to pay the Defendant's costs which are  to
      be subject to a detailed assessment  if  not  agreed  and  are  to  be
      subject to an assessment of the Claimant's ability to  pay  under  the
      Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, s26.



   4. The Claimant's publicly funded costs will be the subject  of  detailed
      assessment.



   5. Permission to appeal to the  Court  of  Appeal  is  refused.   Neither
      representative attended and no grounds were raised at  the  hand  down
      and I consider there to be no arguable error in my judgment.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
point of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal should apply to the  Upper
Tribunal for permission, at the hearing at which the decision is  given.  If
no application is made,  the  Tribunal  must  nonetheless  consider  at  the
hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule 44(4B)  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).

                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -



    JUDGE RIMINGTON: The issue to be determined  by  the  Tribunal  is  the
    claimant's probable date of birth.   The  claimant  is  a  national  of
    Afghanistan and claims to have been born on 20th January 2004 (30  Jady
    1382 in the Shamsi  calendar).  An  age  assessment  completed  on  9th
    October 2019 by the defendant determined that he was likely  to  be  23
    years old when assessed.


The Law

    2. Section 20 (1) of the Children Act 1989 expresses that

    "Every local authority shall provide accommodation  for  any  child  in
           need within their area"

    3. As set out by  Lady  Hale  in  R  (on  the  application  of  A)  (FC)
       (appellant) v London Borough of Croydon [2009] UKSC 8 at paragraph 51



           "It seems to me that the question whether or not a person  is  a
           child for the purposes of section  20  of  the  1989  Act  is  a
           question of fact which must ultimately be decided by the  court.
           There is no denying the difficulties that the social  worker  is
           likely to face in carrying out an  assessment  of  the  question
           whether an unaccompanied asylum seeker is or is  not  under  the
           age of  18.  Reliable  documentary  evidence  is  almost  always
           lacking in such cases. So the process  has  to  be  one  of  the
           assessment. This involves the  application  of  judgement  on  a
           variety of factors, as Stanley Burnton J recognised in R  (B)  v
           Merton London Borough Council [2003] EWHC Admin 1689,... But the
           question is not whether the person can properly be described  as
           a child."


    4. Indeed, R (B) v Merton sets out the  approach  to  be  taken  in  the
       assessment and the burden of proof, and, at paragraphs 37 and 38, the
       court confirmed the following

           "37. It is apparent from the foregoing  that,  except  in  clear
           cases, the decision-maker cannot determine  age  solely  on  the
           basis of  the  appearance  of  the  claimant.  In  general,  the
           decision-maker must seek to elicit the general background of the
           claimant, including his family circumstances  and  history,  his
           educational background, and his activities during  the  previous
           few  years.  Ethnic  and  cultural  information  may   also   be
           important. If there is reason to doubt the claimant's  statement
           as  to  his  age,  the  decision-maker  will  have  to  make  an
           assessment of his credibility and he will have to ask  questions
           designed to test his credibility.


           38.   I do not think it is helpful to apply concepts of onus  of
           proof to the assessment of  age  by  local  authorities.  Unlike
           cases under section 55 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum
           Act  2002  there  is  in  the  present  context  no  legislative
           provision placing an onus of proof on the  claimant.  The  local
           authority must make its assessment on the material available  to
           and obtained by  it.  There  is  should  be  no  predisposition,
           divorced from the information  and  evidence  available  to  the
           local authority, to assume that  a  claimant  is  an  adult,  or
           conversely that he is a child. Of  course,  if  a  claimant  has
           previously stated that he was over 18, the decision  maker  will
           take that previous statement into account, and in the absence of
           an acceptable explanation it may, when considered with the other
           material available, be decisive."


    5. R (A) v Croydon underlines the importance of the decision as  to  the
       age of a young person, particularly an unaccompanied person,  seeking
       asylum.  Indeed the age of the young person is  relevant  because  of
       the material support that is to be provided by the LA even beyond the
       age of 21 years, the approach the Secretary of State may take to  any
       asylum claim and the issue of credibility.  It has also been  decided
       that age is an objective fact which admits one right answer.

    6. In R (NA) v the London Borough of Croydon [2009]  EWHC  2357  (Admin)
       the court stressed the importance of transparent,  fair  and  careful
       assessments of extremely difficult questions noting  the  importance,
       in the age assessment itself, of giving the benefit of the  doubt  to
       the claimant in the case of real doubt when every  other  factor  for
       and against has been appropriately weighed.

    7. I am persuaded that the correct  approach  to  the  "benefit  of  the
       doubt" is  as  reiterated  in  the  two-judge  panel  in  R  (on  the
       application of AM) v Solihull  Metropolitan  Borough  Council  [2012]
       UKUT 00118 (IAC)  at  paragraph  12,  which  in  turn  reflected  the
       judgment from the Court of Appeal in R (CJ) v Cardiff County  Council
       [2011] EWCA Civ 1590.  At paragraph 23 per curiam the Court of Appeal
       observed that

           "...There is no hurdle which the  claimant  must  overcome.  The
           court will decide whether, on  a  balance  of  probability,  the
           claimant was or was not at the material time a child. The  court
           will not ask whether the local authority has established on  the
           balance of probabilities that the claimant  was  an  adult;  nor
           will it ask whether the claimant has established on the  balance
           of probabilities that he is a child".






    8. Indeed in R (on the application  of  AE)  v  the  London  Borough  of
       Croydon [2012] EWCA Civ 547, Aikens LJ at paragraph 23 confirmed that
       the court

           "is, effectively, acting in an inquisitorial role  in  which  it
           must decide, on a balance of probabilities,  whether  the  young
           person was or was not a child at the material time...  In  doing
           so the  court  must  clearly  consider  all  relevant  evidence.
           Ultimately, however, the court has to make  its  own  assessment
           based on the evidence before it".





    9. R(AM) and R (FZ) v the London Borough of Croydon [2011] EWCA  Civ  59
       set out that the purpose of the assessment is to establish a person's
       chronological age based on information derived  from  the  child  and
       assessment of the credibility and plausibility of that evidence.   If
       the chronological information is consistent, plausible and believable
       then no apparent observation about chance appearance and demeanour is
       likely to tip the balance against the age stated by the child.

   10. Additionally, as set out in R (KA (Afghanistan) v  SSHD  [2012]  EWCA
       Civ 1420 at paragraph 35, credibility is relevant and

     'In any case, credibility often does have a very  significant  part  to
           play in resolving an age assessment dispute'.

History

   11. The chronology notes that on 2nd October 2018 the claimant  (DK)  was
       recorded to have claimed asylum in Bulgaria and that he  entered  the
       United Kingdom as an unaccompanied asylum seeker in July   2019.   On
       10th July 2019 he was placed with Mrs S Hosseinbor, foster carer, and
       on 19th July 2019 DK claimed asylum and attended an asylum  screening
       interview at Croydon.  He was issued with an  IS.97M  confirming  his
       claimed age had not been accepted but, since his physical  appearance
       and demeanour did not very strongly suggest that he was 25  years  or
       older, his asylum claim would be processed under  guidance  for  that
       for children.  On 13th September 2019 the London  Borough  of  Harrow
       ("the defendant") commenced the age assessment  process  and  on  9th
       October 2019 a final age assessment meeting was  held,   and  DK  was
       informed  that  his  age  was  disputed.   On  25th  October  he  was
       transferred to semi-independent living accommodation.

   12. The claim for judicial review was issued in the Administrative  Court
       on 6th November 2019 and HHJ Collins Rice made an ex parte order  for
       interim relief and expedition.  On 21st November 2019 a referral  was
       sent to the  British  Red  Cross  Family  Tracing  Service.   On  5th
       December 2019 HHJ Montgomery granted permission for  judicial  review
       on the papers and transferred the claim to the Upper Tribunal.

   13. On 4th June 2020 Mr W Steventon became DK's allocated  social  worker
       and on 17th September 2020 DK was moved back to his foster  placement
       with Mrs Hosseinbor.

Grounds for judicial review

   14. The grounds for Judicial Review asserted that the age assessment  was
       wrong in fact, not based on firm  grounds  and  was  conducted  in  a
       procedurally unfair manner.  The claimant had put forward a  coherent
       and credible account and his  foster  carer  was  supportive  of  his
       claimed age. Taking his claim at its highest "it cannot be said  that
       he would not succeed in  establishing  his  claimed  age  at  a  fact
       finding hearing" (sic).  In particular:

    i) The procedural failings included that there was inappropriate support
       in the form of an age appropriate adult or suitable interpreter.  The
       process ran counter to  the  ADCS  Guidance.  The  appropriate  adult
       should be suitably trained and experienced, but the  claimant  stated
       they were strangers to him. Under the ADCS Guidance  they  should  be
       independent. The same adult was not used, and the defendant  did  not
       consider the destabilising effect.   The  claimant  had  difficulties
       with the first interpreter whose language was Farsi  and  not  Pashto
       which is the claimant's mother tongue. It was acknowledged  that  the
       claimant could speak  some  Farsi  and  English,  but  his  preferred
       language is Pashto.  Best practice  was  not  followed  as  the  same
       interpreter should have been used throughout. There was a failure  to
       gather relevant information and consider relevant country  of  origin
       information or explore the claimant's report that he had a taskera in
       Afghanistan.

   ii) The age assessment should be based on firm grounds and reasons  VS  v
       Home Office [2014] EWHC 2483.  The reasons  given  by  the  assessors
       included   journey   timeline,   demeanour,   physical    appearance,
       credibility of story and level of English, inconsistencies, education
       and detention in Bulgaria.  His journey time left three months to  be
       accounted for, but this could  be  explained  by  initial  confusion.
       Insight into his demeanour (it was reasoned  his behaviour was not to
       be expected of a 15-year-old boy) could have come from a foster carer
       and demeanour was a limited probative value.  The age assessors noted
       that he "appears to be considerably older than  his  claimed  fifteen
       years" but in R v Solihull MBC [2012] it was stated that "almost  all
       evidence of physical characteristics is likely to be of very  limited
       value".  There was no clear relationship  between  chronological  age
       and physical maturity R (R)v Croydon [2011] EWHC 1473  (Admin).   The
       defendant's opinion conflicted with that of the foster  carer.  There
       was no safe ground given for the assessors to assess the  credibility
       of the story of the claimant for example that the government raid was
       made on the grandfather's house rather than attack a nearby  camp  of
       Daesh. The assessors asserted that  his  level  of  English  was  not
       commensurate/consistent with a claimed three-month course and  travel
       since the claimant left Afghanistan the  year  before.  The  claimant
       had, however, been in the UK, been to school in the UK  and  been  in
       foster care and learnt English before arriving. As to  his  education
       no weight could be placed on an unnamed teacher's  opinion  from  the
       Greenway Project at Claremont School, (the claimant left  the  course
       after one day finding the level of  English  course  too  basic)  who
       thought him older than claimed. As  to  his  being  fingerprinted  in
       Bulgaria, he told the assessors that he  gave  his  claimed  date  of
       birth (that is 20th January 2004) but the  assessors  relied  on  the
       fact  that  Bulgarian  detention  was   explicitly   prohibited   for
       unaccompanied minors.  It was not clear how this  was  relevant.  The
       Asylum in Europe information on Detention  of  Vulnerable  Claimants:
       Bulgaria stated that in practice minors were reported as assigned  to
       adults  and  detained.  There  was  nothing  inconsistent  with   the
       claimant's account of being detained and then housed with other young
       people aged between 11 and 25 years  old.    There  were  no  reasons
       explicit or that could be inferred to support the conclusion that the
       claimant was 23 years old.   By contrast the claimant  was  supported
       by his foster carer, had given a consistent account of  how  he  knew
       his age.

Article 34 Request

   15. On 17th September  2020  the  defendant  contacted  the  TCU  ("Third
       Country Unit") seeking assistance with obtaining information from the
       Bulgarian authorities.  On 18th  September  2020  that  TCU  sent  an
       Article 34 request to the Bulgarian authorities.   On  11th  November
       2020 the defendant applied for an urgent case management hearing  (i)
       to admit the witness statement of Ms  Jacinta  Kane  and  (ii)for  an
       order that DK provide consent for disclosure  of  his  personal  data
       under Article 34(9) of Dublin III.  Submissions were filed  in  reply
       on 17th November 2020, objecting to  the  application,  and  an  oral
       hearing was listed for the determination, but  a  consent  order  was
       signed on 20th November 2020.  Pursuant to the consent order on  23rd
       November 2020 DK made subject access requests to the Bulgarian  State
       Agency for Refugees, the  Border  Police  Directorate  and  Migration
       Directorate. On 23rd November 2020, and independently, an Article  34
       response  was  received  by  the   defendant   from   the   Bulgarian
       authorities.

   16. Following receipt of that information by the defendant and served  on
       the claimant 25th November 2020, the claimant's  representatives,  on
       3rd December 2020, made an application for an adjournment of the four-
       day hearing for 10 weeks in order to obtain further documentation  in
       relation to the General Data Protection Regulations ("GDPR")  request
       made  on  23rd  November  2020  and  the  claimant  objected  to  the
       production the Bulgarian response to the Article 34  request  to  the
       court. That adjournment application was refused on 4th December  2020
       with the question of admission of the documentation  in  relation  to
       the Article 34 request to be determined at the hearing.

The Hearing

   17. At the hearing the claimant initially stated that the interpreter was
       from Pakistan and not Afghanistan,  albeit  she  spoke  Pashto,  but,
       after a few minutes, the claimant confirmed that he  was  content  to
       proceed with the interpreter and that they understood each other.  Ms
       Benfield was permitted to seek instructions from her  client  outside
       the courtroom following which she confirmed that the claimant and she
       were content that the interpreter was appropriate.

   18. Ms Benfield made an application that the claimant give  evidence  the
       following  day  as  there  were  documents  which  had  arrived  from
       Bulgaria, as a result of the claimant's subsequent GDPR request,  and
       they  needed  to  be  translated.  In  turn  she   needed   to   take
       instructions.  An application was renewed to prevent admission of the
       letter from the Bulgarian authorities in response to the  Article  34
       request by the TCU (Secretary of State) which had  been  provided  to
       the local authority and the claimant.  Ms Benfield also  objected  to
       the submission of the statement from Jacinta Kane which outlined  why
       the local authority had no incentive to disbelieve and dispute an age
       assessment claim not least because of costs.  Submissions  were  made
       by Mr Holbrook that local authorities took a "considerable hit"  when
       they decided they were going to challenge an age  assessment  and  it
       was  relevant;  social  workers  trod  carefully  when  making   such
       assessments.  Ms Benfield submitted that it was not relevant and  not
       admissible and not an issue between the parties.  If it  was  related
       to costs it was materially different and could be  dealt  with  at  a
       later stage during cost submissions.

   19. In relation to the Article 34 application, Ms Benfield  stated  there
       was a one-page letter which addressed the  EURODAC  search  when  the
       claimant was apprehended.  She maintained that the information  under
       Article 34 could not be shared with courts  or  Tribunals  unless  in
       deciding an asylum claim as a question of principle.  In  effect  the
       Tribunal was being invited to breach the Dublin III Regulations,  the
       parties should not  communicate  the  information  to  the  court  or
       Tribunal.

   20. Mr Holbrook responded that the information was relevant to the Dublin
       process and, regardless of how it was obtained, it was obtainable  by
       the  claimant  and  should  have  been  obtained  well  before  these
       proceedings were issued.  The claimant was under a  duty  to  provide
       the Tribunal with all relevant information and he had the opportunity
       to provide it by two different routes, the Dublin III Regulations  or
       the GDPR.  It was not for the Tribunal to  oversee  breaches  of  the
       Dublin III Regulations, albeit he did not accept it was a breach.  DK
       had used an alias and given a different date  of  birth  and  it  was
       significant  that  when  he  was  interviewed  in  the  UK,  he   had
       specifically stated he had given  the  same  date  of  birth  to  the
       Bulgarian authorities.  This document went to his credibility  as  to
       his age.  Under Article 34(9) it was a  freestanding  right  for  any
       individual to obtain records and the individual has the right  to  be
       informed.

   21. I directed that the document from the  Bulgarian  asylum  authorities
       should be provided to the Tribunal. Article 34 of Dublin III confirms
       that the information exchanged may only be used for the purposes  set
       out in Article 34  (1).   That  paragraph,  however,  includes  under
       Paragraph  (1)(b)  'examining  the  application   for   international
       protection'.

   22. The determination of the age is important for the examination of  the
       claimant's  asylum  claim.  The  defendant  has  the  care   of   and
       accommodates the claimant (according to him  he  is  still  a  minor)
       under the Children Act 1989, and has the power to make a request, and
       a duty to act in the best interests of all children  under  its  care
       (including those with whom the claimant will be accommodated  (and  I
       note there was a reference to the claimant being accommodated at  one
       point with a 12-year-old). Under Section 17 the  LA  has  a  duty  to
       safeguard the welfare of children within their area and   shall  make
       provision for such  services  as  they  consider  appropriate  to  be
       available for accommodated children. In other  words,  the  defendant
       was entitled to make a request under Article 34 provisions of  Dublin
       III.

   23. Even if  that  were  not  correct,  the  letter  from  the  Bulgarian
       authorities exists, is in the  possession  of  the  parties,  and  is
       highly relevant evidence, not least  to  credibility.  That,  as  the
       grounds  for  judicial  review  underline,  is  important  in   these
       particular circumstances, and the parties have a duty of  candour  to
       provide relevant information  to  the  court.   It  is  open  to  the
       Tribunal to direct the  admission  of  relevant  evidence  under  The
       Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (as  amended).   Both
       parties had sight of the letter and it was open to the appellant,  as
       he did, to explain the circumstances of the documentation.

   24. The argument that the underlying documentation was not  available  to
       verify the letter does not found an objection to  its  admissibility.
       Indeed following the GDPR request further documentation was  provided
       and I permitted Ms Benfield to take  further  instructions  from  the
       claimant on the contents of the documentation provided because  there
       was a delay in translation. That  documentation  was  therefore  also
       provided.  There was no indication that any further information would
       be forthcoming.  I also  make  this  observation,  the  claimant  was
       represented and had  ample  time  since  the  solicitors  were  first
       instructed to obtain documentation under the GDPR in preparation  for
       and well before the hearing.

   25. I refused to admit the witness statement of Jacinta Kane.   I  accept
       that the Tribunal should be slow to exclude evidence but the evidence
       suggesting that the local authority had a financial  disincentive  to
       find claimants were adults when they claimed to be minors was  not  a
       matter that was raised in the grounds for judicial review  and  there
       was no allegation of bad faith.  I do  not  accept  that  the  social
       workers conducting the age assessment, as members of the  Health  and
       Care Professions Councils would be guided  by financial incentive and
       on that basis refused to admit the evidence.  I did not  consider  it
       relevant to the question in hand which was the age of the claimant.

The witnesses

   26. At the hearing Ms M Nagiah, principal supervisor  of  social  workers
       employed by Horizon,  adopted  her  statement,  explaining  that  her
       principal role was social worker for supervising  the  foster  carers
       themselves but through her placements she did have  interaction  with
       young  people.   She  confirmed  she  had  never  conducted  an   age
       assessment  and  had  not  been  trained  to  do  so.   Under  cross-
       examination she confirmed that  she  had  been  a  registered  social
       worker for eight years and had spent twelve years  with  Horizon  and
       qualified in 2004.  She did agree  that  it  would  be  difficult  to
       assess the age of males who may or may not be children or adults  and
       that she worked with young people under the age of 18.  When she  met
       the claimant, she stated that nothing about him  'stuck  out'  as  an
       adult.  She based her opinion on his facial features and his  general
       presentation.  She confirmed she had had four meetings which involved
       DK; none were longer than an hour and a half and  the  focus  of  the
       meeting was for the carer.  She had had a further  meeting  since  he
       had been returned to the foster carer in September 2020 and this  was
       a virtual meeting.  She confirmed, however, that she did not  examine
       him in close proximity or in detail and was just going on  her  first
       impression.  She confirmed that he did not look  like  an  adult  and
       stated that she had not only referred to his facial hair but also his
       demeanour, i.e. his stature and his social interaction and  his  tone
       and his voice in that he spoke softly.

   27. She was referred to the photographs in the bundle which were taken in
       2019 identifying facial hair.  She confirmed that  his  "facial  hair
       had grown a bit" and that he had  "not  shaved  for  a  while".   She
       agreed the facial hair looked bristly.  At  this  point  Ms  Benfield
       interjected that the photographs were not contemporaneous.  Ms Nagiah
       confirmed that she thought in her opinion the claimant was  16  years
       old and going to be 17 in January.  She did not consider this  to  be
       an exact demarcation.

   28. When it was put to Ms Nagiah under cross examination that her opinion
       of his age coincided with his claimed age, she stated that  she  gave
       her answer based "on the files we have" which suggest he is 16  going
       on 17.  She accepted that her opinion of his age  was  influenced  by
       his claimed age to some extent, but she could not say how much.   She
       was referred to the email she had written on 7th October  2019  where
       she stated that she believed he was a minimum age of 16 when in  fact
       he claimed to be 15 at that point.  Her opinion was based on  working
       with young people.  She was not qualified to say who  was  definitely
       16 or 18 years old.  She agreed that when looking at a  young  person
       one could never be sure on seeing them.  One might just give  an  age
       range.  When seeing him on four occasions in 2019 she stated that the
       youngest age he could have been was 16 and the oldest age was 17.

   29. It was put to her that if an adult was referred  to  her  service  he
       could not be accommodated, and she agreed.  She did  not  agree  that
       she was concerned to protect his placement because Horizon would lose
       income and retorted that she was an employee.  When referred  to  the
       age assessment document and confirmed that she did not notice that he
       had sideburns and had been shaving for some time because she was  not
       looking for that.  Looking at the photographs, she  still  maintained
       her statement that he was a 16-year-old and denied  that  she  wanted
       him, because it was in the interests of the company, to be a child.

   30. Under re-examination from Ms Benfield she confirmed that she was  not
       a director or owner of the company and that generally Horizon  had  a
       few placement vacancies,  around  four  or  five,  but  the  dynamics
       changed all the time, and the placements changed all the time.  There
       were several placements with unaccompanied  asylum-seeking  children.
       It was put to her that she was asked about factors which informed her
       opinion and she referred to presentation but also,  she  referred  to
       his demeanour and Ms Nagiah confirmed  that  the  claimant  was  very
       polite and complied with boundaries She added  that in complying with
       boundaries someone older might  not  do  so  in  a  foster  placement
       situation.

   31. She was  taken to another photograph in  the  bundle  and  there  she
       confirmed that the  claimant  looked  younger  than  the  other  four
       photographs she had looked  at.   She   advised  that  she  had  been
       informed that the claimant had been assessed as being 23  years  old.
       She disagreed that was possible.

   32. She confirmed that she could not recall whether she had a  record  of
       his age before meeting him but did confirm that in  order  to  access
       the system one had to be under the age of 18 to be referred.

   33. Mrs Hosseinbor, the claimant's foster carer, attended the hearing  by
       skype and adopted her statement and gave oral evidence, stating  that
       she had  experience  of  ten  children  from  Afghanistan,  including
       teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18 and they did have facial hair
       and shaved and looked older  as  they  had  had  harder  lives.   She
       confirmed that the claimant stayed in her care between 10th July 2019
       and 20th October 2019 and  then  returned  in  September  2020.   She
       noticed when he returned that he was sleeping too  much  and  he  was
       taking tablets for depression and playing PUG B, an online game.  She
       still thought he was nearly 17.

   34. Under cross-examination she was  asked  whether  he  had  changed  in
       physical appearance and she confirmed that he  had  lost  weight  and
       that over fourteen months his height had not changed  and  he  "looks
       the same".  In terms of his behaviour she stated  that  she  reminded
       him to shower and clean his teeth and wash his clothes, the  claimant
       asked her what he should do and what he should eat.

   35. The witness confirmed she had no training in  age  assessments.   She
       had been asked by Harrow for her opinion.  She was asked if  she  was
       aware that he had never been to the dentist and had never cleaned his
       teeth on the journey and if he had not brushed his teeth regularly on
       the twelve-month trip, his lack of teeth  cleaning  might  not  be  a
       reflection of his age.  She agreed you would have to teach someone to
       do that.

   36. She gave oral evidence that on the first evening  the  claimant  left
       the house without permission and then told her he had gone around  to
       check the area out.  She confirmed he had been told by her son not to
       go out and there were rules and regulations.  When she  returned,  he
       had left, she was worried and  called  the  police.   At  first,  she
       stated that she would not expect someone of 15 to  behave  like  that
       but then stated that some children wanted to go  out.   She  did  add
       that the claimant took advantage as he had asked her son and  he  had
       said "no" and said to wait for her to return.  It was put to her that
       in her statement she said he was 16 when in fact he claimed to be  15
       at that point, so she must have thought he looked older than even  he
       claimed and whether it was possible he was  17,  as  she  was  not  a
       professional? She responded that she did not know really,  she  could
       not tell someone's age and that it was what she had been told his age
       was and she did not have a reason to say differently.

   37. Mrs Hosseinbor then stated that if he was 18, he would not be brought
       to her, she only accepted children under 18.  She agreed it  was  not
       possible to be precise about his age.  She would  be  told  that  the
       child was this age, and she would "go on that age".

   38. DK was then called to give evidence and both counsel  representatives
       were reminded of the Presidential guidelines on  vulnerable  witness.
       The representatives of the claimant and  the  supporting  adult  were
       advised to be aware of their responsibility to identify concerns they
       may have during the course of the questioning and the  hearing  about
       the claimant's wellbeing.  All were reminded that questioning  should
       be clear and in plain English.   Mr  Holbrook  was  reminded  of  his
       responsibility to question appropriately.

   39. The claimant adopted his three witness statements dated 4th  November
       2019, 8th July 2020 and 6th December 2020.

   40. Under cross-examination DK was asked how  he  knew  his  age  and  he
       stated that his mother had told him and that he needed it because  he
       was going to school, and it was needed by the teachers.  He  did  not
       celebrate his birthday and when asked how he knew he had become older
       he said his mother would tell him that this  was  his  age,  but  she
       would not tell him his birthday.

   41. When asked his mother's age he said he did not know the  age  of  his
       mother but knew the ages of his brother  and  sister.   He  was  then
       asked how it was that he told Harrow during his age assessment of his
       mother's age and he stated that he did not say that.  It was  put  to
       him that he estimated her age and he said, "I have no information".

   42. He was shown the Age Assessment record where he had stated  that  his
       grandfather was 65 and his mother was 33 to  35  years  old  and  the
       claimant stated that he  must  have  said  that,  but  he  could  not
       remember whether he said this or not.  He then said,  "maybe  I  said
       it".  It was put to him that it was unlikely that on his assessed age
       his mother would have given birth to him at 10 to 12 years old.

   43. He stated he left Afghanistan when he was around 14  years  old.   At
       first, he said he could not remember when he left  Afghanistan,  from
       Eid he could not remember but then stated from the first Eid  it  was
       around the 25th or 26th.  It was put to him that Eid was on  15th  or
       16th June in that year and that was the date in the  assessment,  and
       he left therefore on 10th or 11th July 2018.   The  claimant  stated,
       "whoever  asked  me",  he  just  gave  that  answer.   He  said   his
       grandfather was killed 1� months before he left,  which  would  place
       that date in May or early June 2018, but the claimant stated that  he
       did not understand the month of June and that  he  was  14  when  his
       grandfather was killed and that he estimated or guessed that he  must
       have told the age assessors he was 14 and 2 or 3 months when he died.
        He then said he might have said 14 and might have said and 2  months
       or 3 months but he could not remember.  It was put to him  that  with
       this information his month of birth could be worked out and  that  he
       had told us that he was born in January but in fact he  was  born  in
       March or April.  DK stated that he knew his date of  birth  from  his
       mother and that when the taskera was prepared it was for  his  school
       and he was asked why had not mentioned his taskera before.

   44. He was taken to the asylum interview dated 19th July  2019  which  in
       fact transpired to be a  questionnaire  returned  by  his  protection
       claim solicitors, J D Spicer, and he confirmed that he was asked  the
       questions by his  solicitors  in  order  to  give  the  answers.   He
       confirmed the questions were specifically put to him.

   45. He was asked about question 5.3 where he  said  he  did  not  have  a
       taskera.  It was put to him that he could have said he did  have  one
       but not in the UK.  The claimant replied he did not  have  a  taskera
       over here.  He denied he was blaming his lawyers  but  that  was  the
       question that was asked, and he gave that answer.

   46. When asked who Haroon Khan was, he stated that he did  not  know;  he
       was roving around the shops and he found an Afghan 'guy' and he  just
       said he was hungry and where should he go because he  was  new  here.
       He did not tell Haroon he was a child, he just said he was hungry, he
       did not know how Haroon found out he was a child.

   47. He was asked how he came to meet a friend of his uncle's in the halal
       butcher's shop and he stated he went to the shop and  wanted  to  buy
       something and "he asked me where I was from?" DK told  him,  and  the
       friend  said he  recognised   the  claimant  and  said  he  knew  his
       maternal uncle.  He was not the same person who took him to the local
       authority offices.  He said to the claimant that he  thought  he  was
       Muktan's nephew and that he had  seen  DK  when  he  was  younger  in
       Afghanistan  as  a  child.   The  claimant   agreed,   under   cross-
       examination, that this was very lucky and that he was happy.  He  was
       asked why he then did not exchange contact details and he said he did
       not know, maybe he just forgot; they talked a bit and just  left  the
       shop.

   48. It was put to him that he had expressed an interest in  staying  with
       his uncle's friend, with which he agreed, and it was also put to  him
       that he must have been in contact with the friend because  how  could
       he nominate the friend to stay with, if he had  no  contact  details?
       The claimant stated he had told Susan (the  social  worker)  that  he
       would go to the shop and maybe meet  the  uncle's  friend  who  might
       visit that shop again.

   49. The claimant was referred to an  email  from  the  solicitors  Edward
       Taylor which stated it was the claimant who recognised this  man  not
       the other way around.  DK replied, however,  that at that meeting the
       friend recognised the claimant and because he was scared, he said  to
       the social worker that DK recognised the friend and that the claimant
       in turn recognised the  uncle's  friend.   It  was  raised  this  was
       contrary to the email which stated that "my client recognised the man
       as his uncle's friend whom he had  met  previously  in  Afghanistan".
       The claimant agreed with this but then in oral evidence stated he had
       never seen this man before and this was the first time.

   50. On the second day of the hearing, the morning of 16th December  2020,
       the claimant reported he was unwell with stomach pains and could  not
       travel and had to return to bed.  The foster carer considered that he
       had issues with his health and medication, and it was linked  to  his
       mental health problems.

   51.  There  was  no  application   to   adjourn   from   the   claimant's
       representative, Ms Benfield, and it was sensibly suggested that there
       was a reordering of the oral evidence.

   52. I directed that should the claimant fail to attend in the morning  of
       17th December that should  be  evidenced  by  a  medical  certificate
       showing that he was unfit to attend the hearing. That  said,  and  to
       avoid undue pressure on the NHS, in view of the pandemic it would not
       be necessary to obtain a sickness certificate for the  date  of  16th
       December  when the claimant was said to be ill.

   53. On behalf of the defendant, Ms  Susan  Nasinza,  DK's  social  worker
       until June 2020, attended adopted  her  statement  of  21st  November
       2019, and gave oral testimony on  behalf  of  the  defendant.   Under
       cross-examination by Ms Benfield she confirmed that  she  had  worked
       with 50 or more Afghan asylum-seeking children and had also completed
       age assessment training.  She confirmed that she was allocated to  DK
       on 10th July 2019 and saw him every four or six weeks, which would be
       nine or ten times.  She last saw him in February before the lockdown.
        She stated she was not involved in  the  initial  decisions  on  his
       placement.

   54. She was asked how she could be precise in her opinion that  he  could
       be 21 or 23 but likely 23. The least age she thought him  to  be  was
       21. She denied that she was saying he was 23 because  his  colleagues
       had assessed him to be that age and she stated she relied on her  own
       evidence.  Before 11th July 2020 she had not talked to him about  the
       boundaries on the first day  (that  he  should  stay  in  the  foster
       carer's house) but thought the foster carer would have  explained  it
       to him.  She observed that she thought the foster carer  communicated
       with the claimant in Pashto or Urdu but could  not  remember  whether
       there was interpreter there at the first meeting.  It was put to  her
       that before the age assessment  she  had  not  expressed  a  view  or
       concern on his age and had not raised it.  She replied that  she  had
       mentioned this to the team, and she included it in  her  report.   It
       was pointed out that she had a duty at the time on  safeguarding  and
       she stated that she had reported her concern to her line manager,  Mr
       Poole.

   55. She was asked whether she was surprised to know that her concerns  on
       his maturity had not been taken into account in the  age  assessment?
       When asked what she said to Mr Poole she stated that she thought  the
       claimant appeared older but did not remember the  exact  words.   She
       commented on the lines on his face, his beard, the fact that  he  was
       travelling around on his own and going to the gym  travelling  across
       two  boroughs  requiring  a  change  of  bus.   She  was  shown   the
       photographs of him and stated that he looked more mature in  a  later
       photograph, but he still retained the features she had  seen  in  the
       previous pictures.  She  was  asked  whether  children  in  different
       cultures had different hairlines but confirmed that she had not  seen
       young people of 15 with a  receding  hairline  from  that  region  of
       Afghanistan and that her opinion  was  based  on  her  experience  of
       children from that region.  She agreed that there was  a  range  when
       children could experience puberty between age 8 and 14 and  this  was
       the time that boys could develop an Adam's apple and many boys had an
       Adam's apple at 16, with which she agreed.

   56. She stated that she assessed his age looking at a number  of  factors
       including his physical appearance and his demeanour.  She thought  he
       was well-spoken and calm with  good  eye  contact  and  no  signs  of
       nervousness and although children could be like  that,  he  had  just
       come into a new country and getting to know how  systems  worked  and
       she could  still  see  a  maturity  in  him.   She  agreed  that  Mrs
       Hosseinbor provided a good foster placement for him and confirmed  he
       had a good relationship with the other children in the household  and
       that included someone who was over the age of 18 which was one of the
       foster carer's own children.  She agreed he  complied  with  the  6pm
       curfew, which was unusual for a 23-year-old.  She confirmed  she  was
       not sure of the ages in the class at West Thames College where he was
       said to be the elected class representative  and  she  did  not  know
       whether they were 17 or potentially 18.  Ms Nasinza added that, after
       being  removed  from  care,  he  went  to  visit  his  foster   carer
       independently without discussing it with her and despite  the  social
       workers requesting to be informed. This was done  independently,  and
       it required him to travel across three boroughs from Hayes  to  Brent
       via Harrow and although she was criticised for being quick to assume,
       she thought his actions reflected an older age.  She  confirmed  that
       she did not know whether he had talked  to  Mrs  Hosseinbor  to  make
       arrangements.  She did not talk to the foster carer about it.

   57. She stated that he attended Claremont High School  for  one  day  and
       chose not to return because the English language level of  the  class
       was too low.  It was not that his decision was wrong but that he  did
       not  consult  on  the  decision  and  just  made  up  his  own   mind
       independently and stated he was not returning.

   58. The witness agreed that  she  had  recorded  the  visit  as  of  13th
       September 2019 but that the date appeared to be incorrect because  it
       predated the date, he started college but nonetheless it recorded the
       fact that he did not return to Claremont.  The  witness  stated  that
       she had done her own assessment, made her own observations  and  come
       to her own conclusion.  She did not agree with the foster  carer  who
       was supporting him to be the age he was claiming  and  that  she  was
       aware of that.  Based on the factors in her report he was  older  and
       that was her judgment.

   59. In re-examination she gave evidence that  her  interaction  with  the
       claimant was more adult to adult than adult to child.  She stated  he
       did not consult and just told one of the decision had been made.

   60. Mr Ian Poole, the lead age assessor, attended and gave oral testimony
       and adopted his statements.

   61. Under cross-examination he confirmed that the first time he  met  the
       claimant was when he came for an age assessment, but he had  actually
       seen him before in the authority's offices.  Mr Poole denied that the
       age assessment was commenced because the  Home  Office  disputed  the
       claimant's age and stated the assessment was  commenced  because  the
       local authority disputed his age.  The local  authority  tended,  for
       various reasons, only to assess those who they think are adults.   Ms
       Benfield put it to the witness that having reviewed the records there
       were no concerns raised prior to the age assessment  in  relation  to
       his age.  Mr Poole stated that he had  not  read  the  file  but  the
       social worker dealing with him thought he was not  his  claimed  age.
       He was aware that by the time the age assessment commenced there were
       no concerns raised by the foster carer to his knowledge, but he  knew
       that the social worker did not believe him to be 15.

   62. When asked why there were no records of Ms  Nasinza  considering  him
       older, he responded that Ms Benfield would have  to  ask  his  social
       worker.  He stated there were a number of young men who were claiming
       to be 15 and placed in foster care.  It was not right  but  that  was
       what happened.  He accepted there were three  different  interpreters
       at the age assessment, but  the  claimant  was  always  asked  if  he
       understood and signed that he agreed to  the  questions.   Under  the
       ADCS Guidance it was not best practice, but it  depended  on  whether
       delay was  justified  and  sometimes  interpreters  were  simply  not
       available, and one had to work with what one had rather  than  delay.
       The interpreters were arranged by the social worker, so  he  did  not
       know why the same  interpreters  did  not  attend.   He  thought  the
       claimant could understand the interview  because  the  claimant  gave
       appropriate answers to the questions asked and at the start  and  the
       close of the interview, he confirmed  he  understood  what  had  been
       said.  His English was  better  than  Social  Services  were  led  to
       believe and although Mr Poole  was  not  a  Pashtu  speaker,  he  had
       conducted age assessments for many years, and he thought the claimant
       understood what was being asked.

   63. In respect of taking notes the other social worker, Rashid Kato,  and
       he spoke to the appropriate adult and requested that she took  notes.
       The social workers themselves took notes and it was mentioned to  the
       appropriate adult's manager the need for her to take notes.  Mr Poole
       accepted the need and advised her of the wisdom of doing so but  they
       both saw that she was not doing so.  The appropriate adult,  however,
       would not be from the local authority but  from  an,  an  independent
       organisation and Mencap  and  the  Refugee  Council  were  used;  her
       colleagues invariably took notes.  It was  assumed  after  the  first
       interview notes would be taken.  He was asked  whether  the  claimant
       had been deprived of the opportunity to see  relevant  notes  and  Mr
       Poole stated that  both  social  workers  had  taken  notes  and  the
       appropriate adult had done the relevant training.

   64. Mr Poole was asked about his description of the  claimant's  physical
       presentation and noted that not many 15-year-olds were going bald and
       had so many wrinkles/lines.  This was not a question of  someone  who
       was 17 claiming to be  15  but  someone  who  was  in  their  mid-20s
       claiming to be 15, which is two thirds  extra  of  their  life.   The
       claimant looked older for a number of reasons and it was not just the
       facial hair, but it was a significant thick beard and  there  were  a
       number of photographs which showed it did not take long to grow.   He
       had not seen such a thick growth of beard on  a  15-year-old  whether
       from Croydon or Afghanistan.  The hair  was  also  receding,  he  had
       lines and his hands and his whole appearance suggested  he  was  much
       older.

   65. It was the opinion of his tutor at the Greenway Project that  he  was
       older.  He thought she was a teacher not a receptionist.  He accepted
       the claimant was only there a for a day. [The note  on  file  of  the
       telephone conversation between Mr Poole and the tutor was an  exhibit
       to his witness statement].  People were very reluctant to put  things
       in writing.  It was  put  to  him  that  his  decision  did  not  sit
       comfortably  with  the  three  other  professionals  who  gave  their
       opinions  and  whom  he  chose  to  ignore,  including  that  of  Mrs
       Hosseinbor, the foster carer.  He was asked why he did  not  consider
       this opinion in the course of his age assessment but later  clarified
       that he did take this into account, albeit it was  not  expressed  in
       writing in the report.  He observed that  independent  living  skills
       were such that many people in the UK might have those skills  but  in
       Afghanistan most women did domestic activities, so the fact that  the
       claimant could not cook was reflective of nothing.

   66. He stated he was aware that foster carers get paid  �600  to  �800  a
       week and thus there could, in general,  be a financial incentive  for
       independent foster agencies to offer expensive placements  to  people
       who are little trouble, but he was not identifying any  one  specific
       and it was human nature to prefer someone easier.  He was  asked  why
       he did not explore her opinion and Mr Poole responded that the foster
       carers had her opinion.

   67. He thought that physical appearance could be significant depending on
       the age  and  he  referred  to  the  dental  records.   There  was  a
       difference between what the dentist said to  the  social  worker  and
       what she wrote down in email which was  watered  down.   He  observed
       that when asked about his Adam's apple the  claimant's  response  was
       not that expected of a 15-year-old when referring to his genetics.

   68. Following the age assessment there was no  contact  for  over  twelve
       months for the claimant, but he had seen him at various service  user
       events, but he had not spoken to him.

   69. He was  asked  why  he  had  not  recorded  all  information  in  the
       documentation section at internal page 11 of the age  assessment.  Mr
       Poole stated that Rashid's view was not written in the  file  and  he
       did try to explore  with  Mr  Holmes-Attivor,  the  Hampshire  social
       worker, his opinion on age but  he  said  he  did  not  wish  to  get
       involved.  Prior to  that  Mr  Holmes-Attivor  had  spoken  to  Susan
       Nasinza and Mr Poole telephoned him but he would not reply and  would
       not write anything down and did not give an opinion.  Ms Nasinza  was
       strongly of the view that she thought he was a man.

   70. Mr Poole said he was not  responsible  for  the  documentation  being
       passed to the claimant's  legal  representatives.   The  entire  file
       would have been copied and forwarded to the legal team for the  local
       authority, this then would be redacted and passed on to the legal aid
       team for the claimant.

   71. Mr Steventon, the claimant's latest social worker, attended and  gave
       oral testimony remotely and adopted  his  statement  and  was  cross-
       examined by Ms Benfield.

   72. He confirmed he was the allocated as social worker on 4th  June  2020
       this year and he had met the claimant four to six times in line  with
       his statutory responsibilities.  He confirmed that he had  undertaken
       three age assessments and at the time, it was put to him,  he thought
       the claimant was 23.  He had seen  the  age  assessment.   He  agreed
       there was no record of his meeting with the  claimant  on  16th  June
       2020 where the claimant refused to meet him because the claimant  was
       unprepared, but he was sure he would have noted it in his case notes.
        He was told over the phone that nobody had told him  he  was  coming
       and DK refused to see him.

   73. The witness accepted  that  assessing  a  claimant  on  his  physical
       appearance was notoriously unreliable but in cases such  as  this  it
       was relevant.  He accepted that children from Afghanistan  did  shave
       and grow facial hair much earlier, but he considered  that  it  would
       not be as heavyset with the  heavy  shadow  and  full  beard  as  the
       claimant had.  He accepted photographs could be  unreliable,  but  it
       depended on the quality of the photograph.  He also thought he had  a
       very prominent Adam's  apple  and  that  many  unaccompanied  asylum-
       seekers were a lot more reserved and compliant although he did  agree
       that the claimant had been compliant.  He thought  the  claimant  was
       very clear in what he was asking for in terms of asking  for  support
       and still believed he would be more reserved.   He  accepted  it  was
       common for children to ask for a clothing allowance and he noted that
       specific counselling was requested because his  friend  had  attended
       that service but nonetheless Mr Steventon thought  the  claimant  was
       very clear about what particular service he wanted and  that  he  was
       mature in his decision-making.  He was aware that he would leave  the
       placement and go out and do things independently by himself  and  did
       not  need  to  rely  on  support  workers,  particularly  as  he  was
       relatively new to  the  country  and  he  was  confident  in  himself
       although he accepted that by the time Mr Steventon was  allocated  as
       his social worker he had been in the country for a  year.   He  could
       not be trusted with the phone and his sleeping; it was attributed  to
       medication, but as the doctor advised it was only a low  dosage.   He
       stated that he had written to the dentist and asked for his  view  if
       it was rare that his teeth had erupted, and he believed that they had
       written back and said that that was reflective of someone older  than
       15 and that he was older rather than it being a rare case.

   74. He confirmed that he took the step to contact the Home Office on 17th
       September 2020 requesting a EURODAC confirmation and that he did  not
       seek the claimant's consent as it was part of the ongoing  assessment
       and he explained that whenever the service worked with  young  people
       assessment was always ongoing.

   75. Under re-examination Mr Steventon agreed that the claimant was  needy
       in some areas and not in others.  For example, he was not clear  that
       the claimant's inability to  get  out  of  bed  was  genuine  because
       sometimes when he was in foster care his carer said that he was awake
       but refused to get up and was choosing not to go to college and  that
       generally  a  16-year-old  would  comply  and   listen   and   follow
       instructions.

   76. The claimant resumed his  evidence  on  17th  December  2020  and  Ms
       Benfield was permitted to take instructions  from  him  on  documents
       which had been requested  by  the  claimant's  representatives  (GDPR
       subject access request)  in early December  2020,  received  on  14th
       December 2020 and translated on 15th December 2020.

   77. Ms Benfield asked a series of questions and she was requested not  to
       lead the claimant.  He had stated that he did  not  remember  signing
       documents when first in Bulgaria.  He did not remember  how  many  he
       signed.  He stated he did not know why the documents from the  Border
       Police recorded his name as family as S*****.   It  was  stated  that
       there was a date of birth recorded as 1st January  2000  and  he  was
       asked to comment, and he stated he had never heard of  that  date  of
       birth and he had not given this date of  birth  to  anyone.   He  had
       never heard the place Kargahi and did not  know  where  it  was.   He
       confirmed that some  pages  of  the  documentation  did  contain  his
       signature, but he could not remember how  many  pages  and  how  many
       signatures.  In relation to  the  Border  Police  Directorate  order,
       which was said to be announced in Persian, he stated, "Persian is not
       my language, I am Pashto".  He did not  remember  the  Border  Police
       Directorate order being explained to him.  He stated that he did  two
       kinds of signature, one in Pashtu and one in English and this was the
       English one and he signed whichever language came into his  mind,  be
       it Pashto or English.  Other pages contained his  signature,  but  he
       denied he was given any document.  Ms Benfield  asked  the  following
       questions: "Were you ever aware of what  name  was  recorded  of  the
       documents you signed in Bulgaria?", to which  he  replied  "no",  and
       "were you aware of what the date of birth in the documents was?",  to
       which he replied "no".

   78. Under cross-examination he stated he did not know whether his  family
       were wealthy or poor, but his grandfather employed servants  and  had
       two farms.  No-one told him to get the taskera or bring  the  taskera
       when he left Afghanistan and he obtained it when his grandfather took
       him to the city when he was 6 or 7 years old.  This was the city Kaga
       (as spelt by the interpreter).  It was  explained  to  him  that  the
       documents showed he was first detained in Bulgaria on 17th  September
       2018 and he replied he did not understand.  He was asked  whether  he
       accepted he was detained in Bulgaria for 24 hours to which he replied
       that he did not know that he was taken from the car and was there for
       two days in an enclosed place with  approximately  28  other  people.
       After two days he was taken elsewhere.  He was asked roughly how long
       he was detained in Bulgaria to which he replied that he did not know.
        He was asked whether it was days,  weeks  or  months  he  stayed  in
       Bulgaria and he responded that he did not  understand  the  question.
       He was asked whether he was detained for days, weeks or months  again
       and again he stated he did not know.

   79. He was asked whether  he  could  remember  he  was  fingerprinted  in
       Bulgaria.  First, he said he could not remember and then stated  that
       they did take his fingerprints.  Before he was taken the first  time,
       he was eight days in the jungle before he was detained.  It  was  put
       to him that he was very precise when he knew how long he was  in  the
       jungle but not anything else  and  he  responded  that  "sometimes  I
       understand, and I work in my mind but sometimes if I don't understand
       I forget - I am not a computer".

   80. It was put to him that in the age assessment he stated he  stayed  in
       Bulgaria for almost fifteen days and he responded that at  that  time
       he remembered but he did not now.

   81. He accepted that the documents in Bulgaria related to him but stated,
       however, that the documents  recorded the name S*****  and  that  was
       the first time that he had heard of that name.

   82. There was also a letter from the State Agency  for  Refugees  in  the
       Republic of Bulgaria which recorded that he was fingerprinted on  2nd
       October  2018,  about  two  weeks  after  the  first  record  of  his
       detention.   In response to questioning, the claimant said  he  could
       not differentiate whether S**v** and S**w** were similar or not.  The
       claimant stated that he gave his name on one occasion and that was in
       the first place and not anywhere else.

   83. He denied he had used an alias and he was effectively asked  why  the
       officers in Bulgaria who recorded his family name as S**w** or S**v**
       would  have made it up?  It was pointed out that  the  asylum  letter
       identified the date of birth given but the claimant queried the  date
       of birth on the letter from the State Agency for Refugees.

   84. The claimant stated that when he was detained in the first place,  he
       did not understand the language or what the man was saying.   It  was
       put to him that when he was first detained, he gave his date of birth
       and he replied, "yes the first time they asked how old  are  you  and
       the date of birth and the name and asked quickly and took me back  to
       the room".

   85. Mr Holbrook pointed out that the first officer recorded that  he  was
       born on 1st January 2000 and he responded that he did  not  know,  he
       had never been given that date of birth and he did not know why  that
       date of birth was recorded.

   86. It was put to him that he had told the Tribunal a moment ago that  he
       gave his age as well, to which he stated "yes", and he said  he  gave
       the age of 14.

   87. He was then asked why then, if he had given the age of 14, an officer
       would record a date of birth which would tell the officer he was  18,
       and the claimant replied that he did  not  understand  why  they  had
       written that date of birth as 2000 and stated, "they asked me how old
       are you and then  date  of  birth  and  then  I  told  them  in  both
       languages".  The claimant confirmed that this was in English  and  in
       Pashtu and he stated the interpreter spoke Farsi.  He was talking  to
       him and he said he did not understand what he was saying  because  he
       did not understand Farsi.  It was put to him that he knew his date of
       birth in the Gregorian calendar, i.e. the English  calendar,  and  he
       stated, "yes I know the English calendar" and it was suggested to him
       that if this man  interpreted  the  date  of  birth  in  English  any
       problems in the  interpretation would be  irrelevant.   The  claimant
       said he did tell them it was in 2004 but then stated that he said  it
       in Pashto (and not in English).  It  was  put  to  him  that  he  had
       earlier said it in both English and Pashto whereupon the  interpreter
       stated that the claimant was saying English dates but in  Pashtu  and
       then the claimant stated that he did not say it in  English  in  2004
       because there was an interpreter present.

   88. The claimant then stated in English "I just said 2004 in Pashtu, that
       is I stated the dates in Pashtu".

   89. He was asked what he told the authorities about his age and  date  of
       birth in English and he then stated, "I did  not  speak  to  them  in
       English".

   90. He further stated under cross-examination that he had started shaving
       in Serbia  His mother had told him before he left  that  "you  should
       remove your beard" so he looked older and he denied  his  mother  saw
       him with a beard but said "you should remove it and grow it,  so  you
       look older" (at this point the  independent  interpreter  present  in
       court stated that the court interpreter had interpreted  as  "remove"
       when  the  claimant  had  stated  "shave").   This   was   the   only
       interjection from the independent interpreter.  He stated  that  when
       he left Afghanistan, he looked young, so  maybe  she  was  scared  he
       would be travelling with older men.

   91. The claimant was asked about his photographs and the dark shadows  on
       his photographs of his beard and during the  interchange  interjected
       "why are you asking  me  questions  about  my  beard?"   Mr  Holbrook
       observed that the claimant was confident and even cocky, but  counsel
       was reminded that he should not comment,  as  he  did.   Mr  Holbrook
       rephrased  his  interjection  and  asked  the  claimant  whether  his
       responses were those of an adult confident or even  cocky  adult,  to
       which the claimant replied,  "I  don't  know  but  you're  asking  me
       questions and I'm answering them".  He then denied understanding  why
       he was being asked about his beard.  To the question "would you agree
       as children grow older their facial appearance changes?" the claimant
       replied, "what kind of question is  that?".   When  asked  about  the
       significance of facial changes for the ageing  process  the  claimant
       stated he did not understand the question.

   92. The claimant denied he was in touch with his family and when  it  was
       put to him that the Red Cross could help him get in touch, he replied
       "I have asked them many times, but they don't have any  information".
       When he was asked whether he had tried to establish contact with  his
       family after he had spoken to the social worker Susan, he  stated  "I
       didn't do anything, I thought they were going to do it".

   93. He was asked about contacting his uncle by telephone as he  travelled
       across Asia and the claimant replied, "at certain  points  I  was  in
       contact but after that his number stopped working".  He then  stated,
       "I did speak to him some time and then his number  stopped  working".
       The claimant could not remember which country he was in but  said  he
       spoke to him three or four times and then the number stopped working.
        He was asked whether he had tried since he came to Britain  and  the
       claimant replied that he had the number on a piece of paper and  when
       it stopped working, he threw it away.  He was then asked whether  the
       number was not stored in his mobile phone and the claimant said  that
       he did not have a mobile phone and there were other people who  would
       lend him a phone but it was pointed out that he had told  the  London
       Borough of Harrow that he had a mobile phone in Afghanistan and  that
       was how he learnt the  Gregorian  calendar,  to  which  the  claimant
       stated that it was his fellow classmates had phones and that he  knew
       he needed the Gregorian calendar.

   94. It was put to him that he travelled with a SIM card, which he denied,
       and he was referred to the age assessment record.

   95. The claimant was asked how he communicated with his foster carer  and
       he stated that he spoke to her in English and when asked  what  other
       languages it was said that he used Dari,  which  was  an  Afghanistan
       Farsi, and he stated, "she spoke to me in Persian".

   96. After the close of evidence at 12.20pm Ms Benfield advised  that  she
       proposed to submit further evidence, that she wished to make  written
       further submissions and that she would be unable to make  submissions
       that afternoon; although the timetable listed the 17th  as  the  date
       for submissions the overall trial had been listed for four days.  She
       wished to introduce  further  evidence  on  conditions  in  Bulgaria,
       having  taken  instructions  from  her  client   on   the   Bulgarian
       documentation which had only been translated on Tuesday 15th December
       at 4pm and that she wished to produce written submissions in addition
       to her oral submissions and she needed time  to  prepare  them.   She
       stated that she was only able to take instructions from her client on
       that morning of the hearing (17th December ) as translations had only
       been received at 4 o'clock on the evening of 15th December,  Tuesday.
       The claimant had not attended, asserting ill health on  the  previous
       day.  It was pointed out to her that the access request which  became
       the subject of the translations and the late  introduction  into  the
       evidence was occasioned by the  delay in making  those  requests  and
       only prompted by the  Article  34  request  and  further,  there  had
       already been an indication in an application for an adjournment prior
       to the hearing  that  conditions  in  relation  to  Bulgaria  may  be
       presented.

   97. Although  I  consider  these  documents  could  have  been  submitted
       earlier, I allowed Ms Benfield  and  her  team  until  2  o'clock  to
       produce further documentation and to provide it to  Mr  Holbrook  for
       consideration in time for his submissions, as he  proposed  to  start
       at 2pm.  At 2pm I allowed Ms Benfield  to  postpone  her  submissions
       until the following morning.



Submissions

   98. Mr Holbrook submitted that the claimant's evidence was unreliable and
       that he had told lies which were material to the issues in the  case.
       First, he  had  accounted  different  dates  of  birth  to  different
       officials on different occasions. I was being urged to find that none
       were correct.  Secondly, he had lied as he had  given  two  different
       names.  In Bulgaria he had given one  name  which  was  the  same  to
       different officials; both could be incorrect.   Third,  he  told  the
       Harrow authorities that he had given the same date of birth to  those
       in Bulgaria,  which  was  not  correct.   Fourthly,  it  was  totally
       improbable that he would just happen to meet an Afghan man in a  shop
       and now we know that that Afghan was a former care leaver.   Fifthly,
       he told this Tribunal  that  he  met  his  uncle's  friend  who  just
       happened  to  recognise  the  claimant  whereas  we  know   he   gave
       alternative instructions to his solicitor he  recognised  the  Afghan
       man himself.  The oral evidence  was  contradictory  to  the  written
       evidence.  Sixth, it could not be right that he just happened to meet
       his uncle's friend in a shop.  Seventh, it was so incredible  as  not
       worth contemplating that he did not exchange contact details with the
       uncle's friend; how else could he have turned down  that  support  if
       not in touch with that man?

   99. Eighth, it was improbable that he was not in touch  with  his  family
       since leaving Afghanistan.  This morning he confirmed  to  the  court
       that he had not done anything to contact the  Red  Cross  because  he
       thought Social Services would do it and in answer, he stated that  he
       had contacted them lots of times and this morning he  said,  "I  tell
       the Red Cross all the time".  The referral made by the social  worker
       was on 21st November 2019.  Proceedings were issued in this matter on
       6th November 2019 and Harrow put in summary  grounds  of  defence  on
       23rd November, which identified that he had not said what efforts  he
       had made to contact the Red Cross. The Harrow solicitor said  it  was
       intending to seek a direction for disclosure of documents  about  the
       efforts he had made.  A response from the  claimant's  solicitors  on
       1st June 2020 included information from the  Red  Cross  and  several
       months before the offer appointment  and  on  2nd  July  although  DK
       states that he has not heard.  There was no  evidence  of  him  doing
       anything between the referral and the solicitors chasing on 1st  June
       2020, which was a period of six months.  It did  not  ring  true  for
       someone who stated they missed their family.  The  evidence  he  gave
       denied having a mobile and  then  denied  having  a  SIM  card  which
       contrasted with that he knew the Gregorian calendar and he  expressed
       he had a SIM card in the written evidence.

  100. The claimant frequently stated during cross-examination that  he  did
       not understand or queried the questions  he  was  being  asked.   For
       example, he stated "why are you asking about facial hair?"   This  is
       the person with a claimed age of 15 and yet when questions  were  put
       to him by social workers, he began to discuss a family gene.  It  was
       quite clear that he must have known what the questions were about.

  101. It was clearly hard to ascertain the truth and  these  lies  were  of
       material issues as to his age.  The  lies  were  designed  to  obtain
       support  [public  financial]  and  social  worker   support   at   no
       inconsiderable cost to the local authority.  The other benefit to him
       was that if it was established that he was a child it would be harder
       to remove him in the long term.  These lies  were  material  and  not
       told for any other purpose.

  102. His behaviour and appearance were not consistent with his claimed age
       and  this  assertion  was  amply  supported  by  the   evidence   and
       photographs and from that seen of the claimant, who had clearly  been
       shaving for many years and had lines on his brow and on his face  and
       those were lines caused by having lived for some time,  as  were  his
       receding hairline and his pronounced Adam's apple.

  103. He was capable of making  a  decision  on  the  very  second  day  he
       asserted he was in this country and defy the  curfew  that  had  been
       imposed.  He turned down  the  education  offered  to  him  and  this
       explained that he knew his mind and was able to assert himself in the
       presence of adults.

  104. The way he responded to a barrister and the  Tribunal  was  confident
       and the behaviour of a man.

  105. Turning  to  the  witnesses,  Mrs  Hosseinbor  lacked  the  necessary
       expertise and qualifications to be objective and in evidence-in-chief
       she said that the claimant looked older than her own children, having
       qualified it with saying he had had a hard life.  She knew full  well
       height was not an indicator of age.  She commented on his facial hair
       that it was like all Afghan children, but not that it was substantial
       and  coarse  facial  like  his,  however.   She  also  stressed   his
       behaviour, but Mr Poole had already  stated  that  culturally  Afghan
       males behaved very differently.  He had been brought up in a  society
       where males were not expected to fulfil such  roles  and  as  far  as
       brushing his  teeth  he  had  never  even  been  to  the  dentist  in
       Afghanistan on his own evidence and had never brushed his teeth.

  106. She had the opportunity to comment on his departure from  the  family
       home but did not volunteer it.

  107. She stated on a number of occasions she saw no reason to doubt him as
       she had to establish  a  relationship  with  him.   Her  opinion  was
       ultimately incoherent; she was happy to say he could be 15 or  16  or
       17 but not 18.  What she did say was that if he were 18, he would not
       be brought to her.  She constantly fell back on the  point  that  she
       was not trained but then said he was definitely 15.

  108. Turning to Mrs Hosseinbor's own social  worker/supervisor.   She  was
       clear that she lacked expertise  and  training  and  she  lacked  the
       ability to assess him.  She talked about facial hair and had to admit
       it was bristly and not fluffy.  She noted his receding hairline would
       be suggestive of older male of over 30 and it was surprising that she
       had not noticed this characteristic on him.  Her argument  was  based
       largely on physical appearance and  said  very  little  about  social
       functioning.  She was incoherent when stating that he did not look 15
       but the oldest he could be was 17 but not 18, as that would  mean  he
       was an adult.  It  was  also  suggested  that  she  had  reached  the
       conclusion and then  developed  her  argument.   Her  motivation  was
       concern not to  lose  the  placement.   Mr  Poole  pointed  out  that
       independent carers and foster agencies were paid  �700  to  �800  per
       week and it was natural  and  human  nature  for  someone  to  prefer
       someone who was no trouble.  It was also noted that there  were  four
       to five vacancies and thus there was an  incentive  to  continue  the
       placement.

  109. Ben Holmes-Attivor from Hampshire Social Services refused to give any
       further information other than that the claimant was a child or a few
       months older.  Mr Poole did speak to him, but he said he did not wish
       to become involved and  this was shown by  the correspondence sent to
       him and a chasing email for  his  view  in  writing.   It  was  worth
       pointing out that the claimant's solicitor also  contacted  him,  see
       the supplementary bundle, 108, and he confirmed he did not want to be
       involved.

  110. There was no evidence worthy of supporting his claimed age.

  111. Looking at what Harrow social workers made of his age  was  relevant.
       Ms Nasinza was his social worker when he first arrived in July   2019
       and qualified to perform the role of age assessor and had worked with
       over 50 Afghani young asylum seekers.  From July 2019 to May 2020 she
       thought his minimum age was 21 and his maximum age was 23.  She  said
       he looked older and she raised her doubts with the manager;  she  was
       strongly of the view that he was a man.  She noted he had an  ability
       to make relationships, to be calm and an ability to travel around and
       go to the gym across two boroughs and making journeys without seeking
       the assistance of the foster carer.  There was a  decisiveness  about
       his decision-making to leave Claremont and she was of the  view  that
       he had  an adult-to-adult relationship with her.  She drew  attention
       to the lines on his face and was clear that a high hairline was not a
       characteristic of Afghans.

  112. With regard to the criticisms of  the  assessment  process  both  the
       young person and the interpreter were asked at the start and close of
       the interviews to confirm that they understood each other, which they
       did.  That the appropriate adult did not  take  notes  was  merely  a
       formulaic criticism and both the other two assessors took  notes  and
       at no point was this put to Mr Poole.

  113. With respect to the different  appropriate  adult,  this  begged  the
       question of what was supposed to happen if one could  not  locate  an
       appropriate adult.  This was not a case when the claimant  was  being
       faced by cross-examination but being asked questions  by  two  social
       workers and there was an appropriate adult present.

  114. The social workers found a difference  of  eight  years  between  the
       claimant's claimed age and his actual age, which was an  extra  third
       of his life.  Someone of 15 did not start to go bald or have lines on
       his face and this was whether someone was 15 from either  Afghanistan
       or Croydon.  He also had a receding hairline and Mr Poole stated that
       he and Mr Kato split  the  difference  with  Mr  Poole  thinking  the
       youngest could be 21 and  the  oldest  being  26  and  there  was  no
       criticism of that.  The answer given in relation to the Adam's  apple
       by the claimant was  not  the  response  of  a  15-year-old  but  the
       response of someone who knows the age he is trying to cover up.  From
       the note from in relation to the tutor at Greenway  Project  attached
       to Claremont School confirmed he was "quite old", that is  "20 plus".
        On the issue of independent living  skills  that  was  indicator  of
       culture or class rather than a function of age.  The opinions of  the
       foster carer were unreliable because they lacked  the  experience  of
       training.  Mr Poole pointed out the income derived by a foster  carer
       who would clearly  prefer  someone  who  presented  her  with  little
       trouble.

  115. Looking at the totality of the evidence, Mr Poole  did  identify  the
       appearance of the claimant but also his behaviour and elements of his
       story that he did not believe.  Further, he would expect him to  grow
       two to three centimetres.  His height was taken on  6th  August  2019
       when he claimed to be 15 years and 7 months at 163 centimetres and  a
       weight of 56.3 kilograms.  On 4th November 2020 he claimed to  be  16
       years and 10 months, which was fifteen months later but the  claimant
       had shrunk to 162.7 centimetres.  In essence, Mr Poole's evidence was
       reliable and should be accepted.

  116. Turning to that of Mr  Steventon,  he  also  had  qualifications  and
       experience to give an opinion on age.  He had met the  claimant  four
       to six times and on the issue of physical appearance had  noted  that
       his beard was full  and  up  his  face  and  his  Adam's  apple  more
       prominent than to be expected of a 15-year-old.

  117. As for his behaviour he thought the claimant was not reserved. For  a
       16-year-old and he was very clear on what he wanted such as leaving a
       placement and to do  things  independently  without  the  support  of
       social workers.

  118. Drawing that together, one could  see  the  table  submitted  in  the
       skeleton argument that his most likely age from all of  the  evidence
       was that he was 23 years old.  Mr Holbrook submitted  this  case  had
       lasted a year and there had  been  an  injunction  which  had  forced
       Harrow to pay.  As could be seen from the case of Merton at paragraph
       27, this was an obvious case. In Merton the court was referring to an
       age assessment of those between 16 to 20, not those of 23.

  119. The claimant had accepted that he had had coaching from his mother as
       to his age as referred to at paragraph 28 of  Merton.   There  is  no
       passport or travel  document  here   and  that  raised  suspicion  in
       accordance with  the  findings  at  paragraph  30  of  Merton.   When
       considering paragraph 34,  physical  appearance  and  demeanour  were
       relevant.  That said, Harrow had not made the assessments  solely  on
       physical appearance as per paragraph  38  of  Merton.   This  was  an
       obvious case; even obvious cases could now  end  up  in  lengthy  and
       protracted court proceedings.

  120. Turning to A v The London  Borough  of  Lambeth,  this  claimant  was
       brought into Social Services by an ex-care leaver who  stressed  that
       the claimant claimed to be a child.  The social worker had given  him
       the benefit of the doubt at the time and it could be  seen  that  the
       age assessment followed all the guidelines, and the court  should  be
       slow to reach a different opinion.  Mr Holbrook referred to the  Home
       Office documents in relation to the funding framework  such  that  it
       was not in Harrow's interest to challenge an age assessment.

  121. As could be seen from paragraph 25 of  A  v  The  London  Borough  of
       Lambeth, one would expect an Afghan to continue  growing  even  after
       18.

  122. It was not correct to take from paragraph 14 of Solihull  v  AM  that
       age and appearance could not ever be  relied.   Paragraph  14  was  a
       general observation.  The court in that  case  was  critical  of  the
       datasets used  in  relation  to  physical  characteristics  and  gave
       further refinements at paragraphs 15 to 18.  The  full  emergence  of
       the third molar was  characteristic  of  adulthood  and  that  dental
       evidence could be subject to further scrutiny but what  was  said  in
       Solihull v AM still held good.

  123. As could be seen from the report of  Professor  Olze  in  the  report
       entitled 'Comparative study on the  effect  of  ethnicity  on  wisdom
       tooth eruption', full emergence of the third molar was not consistent
       with a claimed age of 15�.  Mr Ockelton in Solihull  v  AM   was  not
       saying that one should not have regard to a fully formed beard or  an
       Adam's apple (see paragraph 73).  It was  accepted  as  a  caveat  in
       borderline cases it would be unreliable to simply rely on  appearance
       but here there was an eight-year gap  between  the  claimed  and  the
       assessed age  and  as  time  went  on,  evidence  on  appearance  and
       demeanour became more relevant.  It was, it was  accepted,  difficult
       to know how far into adulthood someone had developed.

  124. With respect to the dental evidence case law had moved on  since  the
       case of Solihull v AM.

  125. In AS v Kent  (age  assessment;  dental  evidence)  [2017]  UKUT  446
       paragraphs 62  to  63  set  out  the  relevant  expertise  for  those
       assessing and when assessing the evidence of the foster carer and the
       supervisor it was clear they did not have  knowledge  and  experience
       and therefore little weight could be given to their opinion.

  126. As can be seen from the evidence from the dentist, she did say he was
       probably most likely over the age of 15 years.  An oral  eruption  of
       the third molar was consistent with being over the age of 18.

  127. It is likely that this claimant was 23 years of age. The claimant was
       asked questions in Bulgaria on occasions two or three weeks apart and
       in both instances the response was that he was born in 2000.

  128. Mr Holbrook continued  his  submissions  in  respect  of  the  dental
       evidence, and I was referred to the growth charts for males  at  page
       A102 of the bundle.  Mr Holbrook made the point that when there  were
       young  people  from  different  countries  one  would  expect   their
       development to be delayed and one would expect  the  claimant  to  be
       lower down the actual height graph but nonetheless to  develop  after
       his arrival in the UK if he were the age he claimed.  He has not.

  129. In respect of dental evidence, the Olze paper  used  four  stages  of
       molar eruption.  Using the sample of German men, the chances of a 15�
       year old reaching this stage of development was impossible.  The data
       covered German, Japanese and South African and the data  was  broadly
       the same, that is, not supportive of the third molar being erupted at
       the age of 15.  Mr Ockelton made the comment in Solihull  v  AM  that
       full dental maturity was characteristic of adulthood.

  130. It was accepted there were now different stages of dental development
       and a different way of measuring chronological  maturity,  albeit  it
       was accepted it was not a reliable indicator, it did not detract from
       the point that it cast doubt on his claimed age.

  131. The fact is that the dental evidence was on a par with all the  other
       evidence.  There may be a limited  use  for  dental  factors  in  age
       assessment but that did not mean to say that fully mature teeth  were
       not an indicator of being over the age of 18.

  132. In this case the  claimant  had  criticised  Harrow  for  a  lack  of
       candour, but disclosure was performed, and all  relevant  information
       and facts were before the court.

  133. All potential claimants should make subject access requests of  those
       nations through which they have passed when they make age  assessment
       challenges in line with a duty of candour to obtain and disclose that
       material.  It took Bulgaria only three weeks to  respond.   If  those
       requests are  made  promptly  relevant  material  will  come  to  the
       attention of potential defendants and it is likely in this case  that
       permission would never have been given,  there  would  have  been  no
       injunction and there would have been no extensive age assessment  for
       four days.

  134. Mr Holbrook submitted  that  the  information  in  the  supplementary
       bundle [Asylum in Europe] suggests that not all children are sent  to
       detention  and when the claimant crossed into Bulgaria  the  relevant
       age was said to be 14 and thus the police had no incentive to make it
       up to 18 but the further material showed otherwise.  In  response  to
       the criticisms of why would the Bulgarian authorities make up a  name
       or two different dates of birth and that DK had said he gave the same
       date of birth in Bulgaria as he gave here, Ms  Benfield  in  response
       submitted that the practice of the Bulgaria authorities continued.

  135. Ms Benfield proceeded to make oral submissions.   She  advanced  that
       the primary focus was  on  the  claimant's  credibility  and  he  had
       provided a consistent account.  Evidence in relation  to  his  height
       and growth was unreliable and that should be discounted  when  coming
       to a decision.  The local authority had placed significant and  undue
       weight on physical appearance, which was not in accordance with  case
       law and guidance, and the body of evidence supported that he was  the
       age he claimed to be.  She submitted that the benefit  of  the  doubt
       did have a role to play and that Ms Nasinza had not applied it.   The
       benefit of the doubt related to the age assessment itself and to  the
       Tribunal's task.

  136. The ADCS Guidance was relevant to the age assessment,  and  if  there
       were doubt whether someone was a child or an  adult  they  should  be
       classified as a child.  The local authority witnesses all proposed an
       age range for the claimant.  Ms Nasinza confirmed she thought he  was
       21 to 23 but for no articulated reason said he was 23 and the benefit
       of the doubt should mean that she went to the lower end of the range.
        Mr Poole said the youngest age he could be was 21,  albeit  that  he
       was given the age of 23.

  137. As can be seen from AS v Kent, particularly at paragraph 133, when  a
       specific  age  has  to  be  determined  it  required  a   sympathetic
       assessment of the evidence, and this is the principle which should be
       applied.  Age assessment was not an exact science and  it  should  be
       determined on the balance of probabilities.

  138. Although the age assessment decision came before an asylum claim  the
       Tribunal was dealing with someone who had claimed asylum  and  should
       not make findings on his asylum claim, which would be  subject  to  a
       different process and on a lower standard.  It  should  be  borne  in
       mind that this was a person who disclosed  a  particularly  traumatic
       history.

  139. There should be a sympathetic assessment of the evidence where mental
       health difficulties and  victims  of  torture  were  subject  to  age
       assessments as can be seen from MVN v The London Borough of Greenwich
       [2015] EWHC Civ 1942,particularly paragraph 39.

  140. Turning to physical  appearance,  it  was  accepted  that  there  was
       relevant material, and it was not sought to argue otherwise, and that
       point was obvious from B v The London Borough  of  Merton  and  later
       authorities.

  141. Visual assessments were permissible where it was very suggestive  the
       claimant was over the age of 25.  Each case was fact sensitive and it
       was underlined in R (AB) v Kent [2020] EWHC 109 (Admin) that physical
       appearance was notoriously unreliable, and demeanour  could  also  be
       unreliable.

  142. This, however, was not a case where the defendant elected to  conduct
       a short form visual assessment and thus  could  not  have  considered
       that it was a clear and obvious case that he was an  adult.   Had  it
       done so it would have conducted a short form assessment and  declined
       him.  Instead, the approach was to accommodate  him  in  foster  care
       along with other children as with any other  child  of  15.   It  was
       clear the Home Office did not consider this to be  an  obvious  case.
       The defendant's position came  very  close  to  suggesting  that  his
       physical appearance was so stark that he could  not  be  accepted  as
       someone of 15 but that was not in line  with  the  local  authority's
       conduct.  This was not a case where physical appearance  should  have
       had primacy and Mr Holbrook attempted to discount its  unreliability.
       The ADCS Guidance cautions against reliance  on  physical  appearance
       before someone has recovered from their journey and goes  further  at
       paragraph 25 that a social  worker  should  avoid  placing  too  much
       weight on physical appearance and demeanour and  reiterated  that  at
       paragraph 58  it  was  unreliable.   The  unreliability  of  physical
       appearance was broader than the local authority advanced.

  143. It should be borne in mind that physical appearance was  affected  by
       variables such as nutrition,  upbringing,  experience,  genetics  and
       provenance.  Mr Holbrook suggested that the judge should be  able  to
       make observations but that was  highly  questionable.   Additionally,
       the local authority had referenced a sequence of photographs and they
       too were highly unreliable.

  144. Physical appearance was highly subjective and there were no  reliable
       markers.  She submitted that Mr Holbrook had  stressed  the  claimant
       was going bald, which was not borne out in the  evidence,  and  there
       should be significant  caution  attributed  to  the  social  workers'
       evidence when relying on physical appearance.

  145. In relation to the photographic evidence Ms Nasinza accepted that  he
       had changed in  the photographs and I was referred to  paragraph  124
       and paragraphs 207 to 209 and 212 to 213 of AS v Kent in relation  to
       photographs.   Here  the  Tribunal  cautioned   against   considering
       physical appearance from photographs  as  it  could  be  affected  by
       lighting, exposure, cameras, clothing  and  any  combination  of  the
       same.  The utility of benchmarking what certain ages would look  like
       was rejected.  The Home Office's own guidance, which is referenced in
       the bundle, at  paragraph  28,  stated  that  Home  Office  Assessing
       Officers should conduct an assessment in person and not  remotely  or
       such as with a camera.  Reliance on the photographs should be roundly
       rejected.

  146. Turning to the witness evidence, neither height nor  dental  evidence
       could carry any weight in  the  assessment  and  case  law  cautioned
       against  that  analysis  and  in  particular  there  was  no  primary
       evidence.  Mr Holbrook had stated that he  had  stopped  growing,  at
       which point Mr Holbrook objected to the way the submissions had  been
       made.

  147. AM v Solihull, was the starting point and in particular paragraph  17
       in relation to height and growth stated that not much could be gained
       from a "levelling off".

  148. There had been no accurate measurements over  a  period  of  eighteen
       months as required by paragraph 17 of AM v Solihull and this evidence
       fell foul of accurate measurements over a period of eighteen  months.
       One of  the  measurements  must  be  inaccurate  and  it  was  highly
       improbable that the claimant had shrunk. It was not clear whether the
       information was taken with the claimant's  shoes  on  or  shoes  off.
       There was simply too much unreliability placed on this  and  children
       developed in different rates and at  different  ages.   A  v  Croydon
       dealt with the evidence of Dr Stern and stated that  measurements  of
       height and weight were not reliable unless carried  out  by  properly
       trained  people  and  the  measurements  here  indicated  a  lack  of
       scientific basis.  Maturity and chronological age were two  different
       things.  Caselaw confirmed that the rate of his growth was still  not
       a reliable indicator of age.  The rate of growth could  be  distorted
       when access to a better diet in the UK and there were no measurements
       from a clinical paediatric medical professional.

  149. The dental evidence displayed a pseudo-statistical analysis  and  the
       local authority stated that having fully erupted molars suggested the
       claimant was an adult but there was no reliable  information  on  his
       dentistry.  The dentist's view  recorded  in  writing  was  that  his
       dental profile was consistent with him being over 15, which  he  was.
       Mr Holbrook sought to rely on the note of telephone call, but  it  is
       difficult to see how that sits comfortably with the point that people
       often are reluctant to give  a  view.   The  local  authority  simply
       attempted to undermine it because it did not support their case.  The
       dental opinion was consistent with what was said  in  AS  v  Kent  at
       paragraph 97.  The subject could be at stage H (i.e. well  developed)
       at the age of 14.  The evidence we had was minimal from the Kingsbury
       Dental Practice.  He was examined at the age of 15 years and 7 months
       and there was no  x-ray,  as  required,  and  no  assessment  of  the
       development of his teeth.

  150. Mr Ockelton accepted  in AM v Solihull at paragraphs 56  to  57  that
       the eruption of the third molar was indicative of adulthood,  but  it
       was quite wrong to say any more and the court should be alert to  the
       dangers of misuse of such information.  In AS v Solihull there was  a
       summary at paragraph 109.  Professor Olze had been looking  at  three
       different nationalities not including Afghans and it  was  unreliable
       to infer that an Afghan's development was  the  same;  there  was  no
       information on Afghanistan.  The Tribunal found it to be unreliable.

  151. Ms Benfield referred to paragraph 77 of R (ZM and SK)  v  The  London
       Borough of Croydon (Dental age assessment) [2016] UKUT  00559  (IAC),
       which referred to the requirement of dental x-rays; it was  difficult
       to  see  how  this  assisted  the  defendant.   Overall,  a  detailed
       examination was required, which had not been conducted here.  It  was
       only relevant to compare comparable ethnic groups  because,  overall,
       teeth were not a reliable indicator.

  152. The evidence from Bulgaria was from two sources, the letter  and  the
       response to the subject access request.  In  respect  of  the  letter
       from the State Agency for Refugees there was  nothing  that  underlay
       this information, and it was not clear whether it was building on the
       border force information.  This should be treated with  caution  when
       the primary records were absent, bearing in mind the  possibility  of
       error and  errors  did  occur.   In  relation  to  the  border  force
       material, the record showed the name of D S***** born on 1st  January
       2000.  The claimant would have had no motivation to provide incorrect
       details and had been consistent about his date of birth.

  153. His place of birth is given in the documents as being Kargahi but  he
       did not have knowledge of  such  a  place.   Nothing  in  the  papers
       supported that that place was relevant, and the  claimant's  evidence
       had a ring of truth about it and he had not attempted to explain away
       the material.  He simply says he does not  know  how  this  date  was
       given and maintains that he has provided the  same  data  throughout.
       His encounter with the police  in  Bulgaria  was  reflective  of  the
       country background material and he explained  that  they  encountered
       the border police on the third attempt with a group of 28 others when
       he was detained.  He stated in his second and third statements he was
       badly treated and rushed to provide information and he  was  provided
       with an Iranian interpreter and could  hardly  understand  him.   His
       account of his treatment in Bulgaria is externally consistent.

  154. The evidence showed asylum seekers are detained  and  ill-treated  in
       Bulgaria.

  155. Country  background  material  states  the  Bulgarian  police  cannot
       lawfully detain asylum seekers under the age of 18 and he was given a
       date of birth in 2018 as being 2000.

  156. I was referred to extracts from the EASO age assessment  practice  in
       Europe (2013 and a second edition 2018)  to  compare  practice.   The
       extracts showed that in 2013 assessment was made by  Social  Services
       whereas in 2018 it was assessed only on documentation.  The claimants
       were not informed of age assessments and so, it was submitted, it was
       highly probable that a visual assessment was conducted of  which  the
       claimant had no knowledge.  The country background material  referred
       to pushbacks, which was consistent with the claimant's  account,  and
       there was also reference to a lack of support on  the  border  and  a
       general lack of information and a failure to allow claimants  to  ask
       questions.   The  2017  Age,  Gender  and   Diversity   Participatory
       Assessment Report from the UNHCR representation in Bulgaria  referred
       to pushbacks.    There was also a general lack of information on  the
       procedures for claimants such that many detainees were not  aware  of
       the reasons for their detention on apprehension  by  the  police  and
       their further legal options including the asylum system and that they
       did not receive appropriate care.  The  Asylum  Information  Database
       Report (undated)  indicated  that  in  practice  both  asylum-seeking
       children and adults continued to be detained.  One of the reasons for
       the age  assessment  disputing  his  age  stated  that  detention  of
       children was prohibited, which was incorrect.

  157. To circumvent the law  that  unaccompanied  children  should  not  be
       detained two tactics were deployed, one was  to  record  them  as  an
       adult and the other was to suggest they were  accompanied.   This  is
       the approach of the police. The Asylum Information  Database  Country
       Report on  Bulgaria  dated  2018  supported  the  claimant's  account
       response and showed he had provided correct  details.   His  recorded
       date of birth of 1st January 2000 was simply  nominal  to  facilitate
       his detention.

  158.  The  assessment  should  follow  KB  &  AH   (credibility-structured
       approach)  Pakistan  [2017]  UKUT  00491,  which  held  that  detail,
       internal and external consistency and plausibility  was   helpful  in
       approaching credibility, and, having  found  a  young  person  to  be
       genuinely credible his date of birth should be accepted.   Where  his
       oral history was credible the observations  on  demeanour  were  less
       relevant.

  159. Credibility was critical.   There  had  been  internal  and  external
       consistency and plausibility.  He  had  provided  account  which  was
       highly externally consistent.  DK gave a clear account and  knowledge
       of his age and date of birth and his chronology  was  consistent,  in
       other words, how old he was at different times.  He promptly answered
       how old he was in Bulgaria when he stated he was 14.

  160. He was asked  those  questions  repeatedly  and  although  they  were
       appropriate, he was a vulnerable witness, and he was frustrated.

  161. In relation to the nine lies that Mr Holbrook states that he had made
       she stated they  were  not  made  out.   In  relation  to  the  three
       different dates of birth there were significant shortcomings  in  the
       Bulgarian system generally.

  162. In terms of his different names it was perfectly possible that  there
       was an error.  The points made by Mr Holbrook were simply repetitive.
        It was not implausible that he should meet a care leaver who was  an
       Afghan man in a shop in Harrow.  The reference to who recognised whom
       was entirely credible and simply a misunderstanding  in  relation  to
       his uncle's friend.  That he met an uncle's friend in an  area  where
       there was an Afghan population was  not  so  incredible  nor  was  it
       incredible that they might not exchange  details  because  it  was  a
       short encounter.  Equally, in relation to  the  discussions  with  Ms
       Nasinza that he had told her he may be able to stay with  an  uncle's
       friend  was  believable.   Out  of  fear  he  proposed  this  as   an
       alternative and potentially not thinking this through although  there
       was no lack of credibility.

  163. In relation to  tracing his family, in oral  evidence  he  could  not
       remember but the steps he took were recorded  and  there  were  early
       records that he agreed to tracing contact through the Red Cross  with
       his family and he had stated that he wished to trace his family.  The
       records showed  this on 6th August 2019, and on 1st June 2020 he  was
       on the waiting list and  there  had  been  nothing  since.   On  20th
       November 2019 it was indicated he would like help and yet on the same
       date it was considered that it was only possible  if  the  Red  Cross
       were operational in his home area.  There was a review  in  2020  and
       the Red Cross were waiting to resume tracing.  It showed that he  was
       waiting and on 29th October 2020, the recent records showed  that  it
       was not clear if the foster carer had followed it up.

  164. The local authority had a great deal of involvement in  this  and  it
       was wrong to suggest that this was relevant to his  credibility  when
       he had done all that he could in his weeks of arrival.

  165. In relation to the means of contact with his uncle  and  whether  the
       SIM card stopped working, the information had been  mischaracterised.
       It could be seen from the handwritten notes of  the  social  workers'
       age assessment interview what is said that he had the number and  the
       SIM card had stopped working.  This was how it  was  transposed  into
       the age assessment.  DK was obviously talking about his  uncle's  SIM
       card.

  166. Finally, the point was made that when the claimant was questioned, he
       queried why he was being asked about facial hair and it was said that
       he was well aware, but that was simply not made out and the  evidence
       from Mrs Hosseinbor was that young men do grow a lot of hair  earlier
       than those who are from the United Kingdom. It was  not  material  to
       his age.

  167. The claimant's physical appearance had been exaggerated by the  local
       authority and their position had been inconsistent.  It was difficult
       to know how the local authority could advance anything  on  demeanour
       as Mr Steventon stated that the claimant was compliant and there  was
       no consistent picture to suggest  all  unaccompanied  asylum  seekers
       presented in the same way.  Mrs Hosseinbor considered  his  behaviour
       highly consistent with that of a younger person and it was not  right
       to undermine Mrs Hosseinbor, on the basis that she received  �600  to
       �700 per week and would not wish to lose  a  compliant  unaccompanied
       asylum-seeking minor merely because  he  is  compliant  when  it  was
       advanced that he could be very difficult.

  168. It was correct that the claimant could articulate his own wishes, but
       this went little further than he was confident and could take  buses.
       The evidence showed he needed a high  level  of  support  beyond  the
       average.

  169. Mrs Hosseinbor had raised his problems with  his  mental  health  and
       nowhere had that been engaged with.

  170. It was noted that  the  witnesses  were  not  trained  but  if  their
       evidence was to be discounted it would only ever  be  social  workers
       who could offer an opinion worthy of credit and their opinion was  in
       conflict with the ADCS guidelines.

  171. The opinion of foster carers and teachers was important as per  AM  v
       Solihull, paragraphs 19 to 21, and  the  opinion  of  teachers  could
       provide a useful opinion.  Mrs Hosseinbor was an  experienced  foster
       carer and had fostered more than ten children and was well-placed  to
       give evidence.  Her children  were  older.   When  he  was  in  semi-
       independent placement for 16 to 17 year olds the  records  raised  no
       concern about his presentation and there was nothing in  relation  to
       his college placements, where he was well-integrated.   The  concerns
       only came from the local authority's social workers and  "many  other
       professionals had no concern professed".  The witnesses were mutually
       supportive.

  172. The age assessment should be given less weight because  it   was  not
       conducted  in  line  with  the  ADCS  Guidance  notwithstanding   the
       involvement of Jacinta Kane in its authorship.  There was a  lack  of
       continuity, with appropriate adults which was contrary  to  guidance,
       and there was no cogent explanation.  The claimant explained he  felt
       the appropriate adults were strangers and he was not  supported,  and
       he could not rely on  them.   He  was  vulnerable  and  it  was  very
       important that he had a measure of support and further, there  should
       have been an independent record of what was discussed.  Mr Poole  was
       less than impressive  and  merely  stated  that  the  option  was  to
       adjourn, in which case he should have done that.  It was no answer to
       merely suggest that the claimant was able to look after himself.  The
       claimant should have had a procedurally fair assessment.   There  was
       also a lack of consistency in the interpretation, which  was  unfair,
       and  more  importantly,  there  was  a  failure  to  gather  relevant
       evidence.  The local authority accepts that it should  have  referred
       to the social worker, the foster carer and the  report  of  Greenaway
       and that was a significant omission.  Mrs Hosseinbor's,  Ms  Nagiah's
       and   Mr   Holmes-Attivor's   opinions   were   withheld   from   the
       correspondence and that was referred to in the High Court and  had  a
       significant bearing on the claim when permission was granted.

  173. This  failure  to  disclose  was  not  explained  by  Harrow's  Legal
       Department and  these  should  have  been  included.   Mr  Poole  was
       unconvincing when he said that they were, and indeed he accepted that
       they should have been included.  The local authority knew  full  well
       that Mrs Hosseinbor and Ms Nagiah had different views.

  174. When looking at  the  duty  of  candour  the  conduct  of  the  local
       authority was "reprehensible" and could  have  barred  this  claimant
       from bringing this challenge and barred him  from  obtaining  funding
       and to hold such opinion back was a matter of  high  importance.   Mr
       Poole's reasoning conflicted with the approach he  took  to  that  of
       Greenway when he accepted, he had not spoken to Miss  Salim  and  his
       evidence was highly unsatisfactory.  He clearly had not  explored  or
       given any consideration to it.   The  sole  record  of  Miss  Salim's
       evidence was a report from Mr Poole and her opinion that he is "quite
       old - 20 plus" but there was no information provided and  no  written
       opinion provided by her and no probing of the nature  and  extent  of
       the observation.

  175. The Tribunal was invited to find that the claimant  was  the  age  he
       claimed to be.

Analysis

  176. At the commencement of the hearing before me the  claimant  raised  a
       concern  that  the  interpreter  came  from  Pakistan   rather   than
       Afghanistan albeit she spoke Pashto.  Time was given to the  claimant
       to resolve whether there would be an issue with  the  interpreter  in
       the hearing  and  the  claimant  was  invited  to  consult  with  his
       representatives  (both  counsel  and  solicitor  were  in  attendance
       throughout the proceedings) and DK confirmed that he could understand
       and chose to proceed.

  177. Throughout analysing the evidence I have considered  the  claimant  a
       vulnerable witness under the Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of 2010.
        He claimed to be a  child,  but  also  that  he  has  mental  health
       difficulties for which I give some context.

  178. The claimant, DK, denied any medical problems in his  Asylum  in-take
       interview dated 19th July 2019 save he disclosed a nasal problem  and
       stated he had nightmares.   The  medical  notes,  however,  from  the
       Willow  Tree  Family  Doctors  Surgery  recorded  the  claimant   was
       registered with the practice on 23rd July  2019  as  a  looked  after
       child, and on 12th August 2019 recorded 'poor sleep and a history  of
       'headache' (sic). In  a  statement  dated  18th  September  2019  and
       attached to the interview questionnaire and signed by the claimant he
       also denied any medical issues.   The GP  notes  identified  on  24th
       October 2019, that the claimant 'was at ESOL centre and they  did  an
       age assessment, and they think he may be 23 years of age,  so  course
       is going to stop this has made him depressed  and  for  a  few  weeks
       sleeping all the time'.  He was diagnosed with depression.  There was
       no  formal  psychiatric  report,  but  he  had  been   referred   for
       counselling.  In January 2020 DK is described  in  the  GP  notes  as
       'cheery and upbeat' and in June 2020 as 'mood fine'; on  8th  October
       2020 his GP notes referred to him  'MH  Services'.  He  is  currently
       taking a low dose of Citalopram.  When assessing the evidence and for
       example discrepancies in the evidence,  I  have  borne  in  mind  the
       relevant guidelines.

  179. I first address the ground in relation to the procedure  of  the  age
       assessment.

  180. The age assessment was conducted by two qualified social workers  who
       were experienced in assessing age including the age of  young  asylum
       seekers from Afghanistan.  Mr Poole detailed his qualification, which
       included that he  had  a  BA  (Honours)  degree  from  University  of
       Nottingham,  a  CQSW  and  Diploma  in  Social  Work  from  Newcastle
       University, a Diploma in Management Studies from Kingston Polytechnic
       and the Institute of Personnel Management and a  Master  of  Business
       Administration from the City University of London.  He had worked  in
       local  authority  social  work  for  approximately  eighteen   years,
       predominantly as a manager of Looked After Children and  Court  Teams
       and worked  for  the  London  Borough  of  Harrow  Leaving  Care  and
       Unaccompanied Asylum-Seeking Children Team since  November  2014  and
       had undertaken a considerable number of age assessments.

  181. Rashid Kato was also a qualified HCPC registered social worker with a
       BA (Honours) degree in Social Work from  Brunel  University  and  had
       been working in  the  London  Borough  of  Harrow  Leaving  Care  and
       Unaccompanied Asylum-Seeking Children Team since September 2017.

  182. The age assessment acknowledged the guidance (ADCS) at the outset  of
       the written report, noting that age assessment was  a  complex  task,
       that the assessment  may  be  legally  challenged  and  that  it  was
       extremely difficult to ascertain age with certainty.  Also noted  was
       the importance of the age assessment to the  assessment  of  need  of
       subsequent provision of service for the young  person  and  that  the
       assessment should be conducted from a holistic perspective but was  a
       process of professional judgment.

  183. The assessors explained the parameters at the outset  such  that,  in
       age assessments, the benefit  of  the  doubt  should  always  be  the
       standard practice and that where practical two assessing workers were
       beneficial.  It was acknowledged that  young  people  may  have  been
       asked previously many difficult and distressing questions.  The  form
       and type of questioning to be adopted  was  noted;  open-ended,  non-
       leading questions should be asked and the importance of  feedback  to
       the young person at the conclusion of  the  assessment.   The  social
       workers were clearly aware of  the  claimant's  said  vulnerabilities
       from the outset and the  demands  of  conducting  an  age  assessment
       within the ADCS guidance.

  184. Criticism was made of the age assessment on the basis that notes were
       not taken by the appropriate adult  and  the  adult  and  interpreter
       changed.  The claimant's objections were that first,  he  would  have
       felt more comfortable, and secondly that there were no  notes  taken.
       The same adult attended the first two meetings and  another  on  23rd
       September 2019 and 9th October 2019. There was no indication that the
       claimant made any specific objection to the adults themselves, indeed
       he signed in all cases,  including  the  last,  that  he  wished  'to
       proceed with the  independent  person  present'.   I  note  that  the
       claimant had no hesitation in deciding that a  particular  course  at
       Greenway College was unsuitable for him and expressing his  views  at
       that time. Those appropriate adults present were  suitably  qualified
       as  confirmed  by  Mr  Poole  and  from  a   reputable   organisation
       independent of the local authority,  regularly  used,  namely  Harrow
       Mencap. Whilst a failure to take notes is  not  ideal  that  omission
       does not fundamentally undermine the age assessment  process  itself,
       the information taken therein nor the reasoning. The  assessment  was
       undertaken by two qualified HCPC registered social  workers  and  the
       change in adult did not appear to have  hindered  the  claimant  from
       answering questions. There are records of the interchange  and  there
       was there no recorded complaint made by the appropriate adult of  the
       process adopted by the social workers.

  185. As evidenced by Mr Poole, he asked the  adults  to  take  notes.   By
       contrast both he and his colleague took notes which are evidenced  in
       the bundle. Little by way of comment was made on those notes save for
       one issue of transposition into the age assessment itself in relation
       to the sim card and that I have addressed   below and by reference to
       other evidence.   There is always a balance  to  be  weighed  between
       delaying the age assessment should  the  claimant  demur  as  to  the
       appropriate adult or to proceed.  In this context and in the  absence
       of any particular criticism of the appropriate adult, the  fact  that
       in hindsight it was discovered the adult did not  make  notes  (there
       was no criticism by the adults of the conduct of  the  assessment  at
       the time) and that the claimant may have felt more comfortable with a
       constant presence, does not undermine the fairness  of  the  process.
       There was no indication from Mrs Hosseinbor,  the  claimant's  foster
       carer, that he had raised significant concerns  with  her  about  the
       process at the time. It is clearly not possible to insist on specific
       performance that is the same person attends each meeting even if that
       is desirable. The role of the appropriate adult  is  to  support  and
       advise and to ensure the claimant understands the process and his/her
       rights to legal advice.  The adult is not a legal representative  and
       there is no authority which suggests that the absence of  handwritten
       notes or a change in  personnel  detracts  from  the  weight  of  the
       assessment itself.

  186.  There  appears  to  have  been  no  response  from  the  Information
       Commissioner's Office to the  complaint  vigorously  pursued  by  the
       claimant's legal representatives and who requested that the defendant
       reprimand Harrow Mencap as a result and further requested  disclosure
       of material pertaining  to  the  local  authority's  handing  of  the
       situation  with  'Harrow  Mencap'.  I  see  that  Harrow  Mencap  did
       ultimately respond citing the pandemic as causing disruption to their
       service.   The sanction of Harrow Mencap is not for this tribunal nor
       relevant  to  the  determination  of  age.  As  pointed  out  to  the
       solicitor, the ADCS guidance is not definitive that such notes should
       be available, and I am not persuaded that the change of adult or lack
       of notes hindered the process unfairly.

  187. As to interpretation, the claimant was interviewed  as  part  of  the
       assessment process on 13th, 17th and 23rd September and was  informed
       of the preliminary outcome of the assessment  on  9th  October  2019.
       The claimant had ample opportunity to  challenge  the  interpretation
       given and that was not done. There was further criticism  that  three
       different  interpreters  were  used.  The  claimant  signed  on  each
       occasion to confirm that he fully understood the interpreters and all
       the questions asked, both at the start of the age assessment, and  at
       the close and that he understood the interpreter.

  188. If the claimant was uncomfortable with the  interpreter  at  the  age
       assessment, I conclude that he would have said so particularly as  he
       was able to make an independent self-determination on 10th  September
       2019, not two weeks earlier, that he would not  attend  the  Greenway
       project to learn English.  The nature of  the  assessment  (three  or
       four different sessions with the young person on different dates) may
       necessitate a change of interpreters over the various interviews  but
       equally  affords  time  for  challenge.  As   long   as   appropriate
       interpretation is undertaken there should be no particular difficulty
       with such a change and this does not render the age assessment unfair
       or undermine, in these particular circumstances, the product  of  the
       assessment.

  189. The handwritten notes indicate that the questions were put in a clear
       and simple terms by experienced social workers.  From  the  questions
       asked and the responses given by the claimant, including  his  fluent
       challenge to the interpreter when the claimant considered he/she  had
       not interpreted accurately,  I am not  persuaded  that  there  was  a
       difficulty with the interpretation and that this undermined  the  age
       assessment.

  190. Mr Poole was also criticised for  his  failure  to  address  all  the
       opinions available.  In his oral evidence which I  address  below  he
       did confirm that he considered all opinions. That I accept because  I
       have no reason to doubt his professional word,  and the records  show
       that such opinions were solicited in writing prior to the  conclusion
       finally drawn.

  191. The claimant adopted his  three  further  statements  signed  on  4th
       November 2019, 8th July 2020, and 6th December 2020.  He stated  that
       his mother told him his age when he went to school and that he needed
       his age in order to attend school.  There were however a  variety  of
       inconsistencies between the claimant's oral evidence and the  written
       records of his evidence in the bundle (including but not only the age
       assessment) which are significant and that is despite allowances made
       for his claimed age and  mental  health  issues  detailed  above  and
       experiences.

  192. For example, in oral evidence he stated that he knew the age  of  his
       siblings but denied in oral evidence that he  knew  the  age  of  his
       mother.  This however, together with the age of his  grandfather  and
       his father was recorded in the  age  assessment  (and  clear  in  the
       handwritten notes).  When asked why he told the  age  assessor's  his
       mother's age he stated, 'I didn't say that'.  To the question that he
       must have estimated her age he replied, 'I have no  information'  and
       then when asked to consider the pages of  the  age  assessment  which
       recorded his responses on his family's age, he stated  'I  must  have
       said but I can't remember whether I said this or not'.

  193. I can accept that the claimant might have some mental health  issues.
       He could, however, clearly remember many elements of his evidence  in
       detail. It is possible to forget some details, but I do not accept he
       would fail to remember that he had previously known the  age  of  his
       mother.  During the course of his evidence when asked whether he  had
       made it up he merely responded, 'maybe I said it'.   His  explanation
       was that when he came to the UK, he might have given her age, but  he
       did not have much information and was  confused.   Even  if  he  were
       confused about the age itself, I do not accept that he  would  forget
       that he even knew his mother's age.

  194. Further the age assessment was  not  conducted  immediately  on  DK's
       arrival in the UK and he had sufficient time to rest  and  recuperate
       before he was interviewed. When asked about this the claimant  stated
       that maybe he had given his mother's age but then  said  he  did  not
       understand. He gave no adequate explanation as  to  why  he  did  not
       understand the straightforward question which is such that he  either
       knew the age of his mother or he did not. He was not diagnosed with a
       serious mental health problem and was not presented as  someone  with
       specific cognitive special educational needs  and  the  question  was
       clear.

  195. In his signed statement dated 18th September 2019, he stated  he  had
       come through countries  including  Bulgaria  and  Serbia  but  denied
       knowing the others (i.e. France),(he also stated that he did not know
       in which countries he had been fingerprinted although  told  in  July
       2019) but, by contrast and in particular in his  age  assessment,  he
       gave details of how long he stayed in Calais.

  196. In his questionnaire dated  19th  September  2019  DK  was  asked  to
       declare the languages he spoke, and this  reply  was  simply  crossed
       through; he did not declare the languages  he  knew  including  Urdu,
       English and Dari albeit he confirmed that the solicitors went through
       the questions with him.  DK claimed to having lived in a  village  in
       Afghanistan until the age of 15 years and yet denied to the education
       authority that he could speak English.  He corrected the  interpreter
       during his age assessment because  he  stated  he  could  speak  some
       English and  recognised  deficiencies  in  interpretation.   He  also
       disclosed to the social workers that he could speak or  understand  a
       range of languages including Pashto, English, Urdu and Dari.   Indeed
       he confirmed in oral evidence that  when  he  first  lived  with  his
       foster carer, she spoke to him in 'Persian', and I do not accept  she
       would have done so had he understood little.  Further,  he  left  the
       English language class in Claremont High School because he thought it
       too elementary for him.

  197. Although it was  stated  that  he  gave  a  consistent  chronological
       account throughout, he could not  give  the  year  he  actually  left
       Afghanistan, either in Pashto or in English and merely repeated  when
       questioned that he left when he was 14 years old.  In response to the
       exact date he left (rather than the year) he stated that he left from
       the first Eid around 25th or 26th in that year  (I  ignore  the  fact
       that he could not remember at first the timings of him  leaving).  He
       thus could  answer  some  specific  questions  but  not  others,  the
       complexity of which was similar. The repetition of the answer that he
       was 14 when he left does  not  render  his  account  more  plausible.
       Having stated that his age was 14 years when he left  and  apparently
       knowing his date of birth he could not account for his age  when  his
       grandfather died but did state in oral evidence that his  grandfather
       died 1 � months before he left and  this,  as  pointed  out  to  him,
       indicated that his date of birth was in March or April.

  198. A further difficulty was that the claimant stated in  an  Asylum  in-
       take interview questionnaire dated 19th July 2019 given to  the  Home
       Office, that he did not have a taskera.  The framing of the  question
       was clear.  According, however,  to  his  witness  statement  of  4th
       November 2019, also prepared by a solicitor, and  oral  evidence,  he
       confirmed that he did have a taskera and thus he knew  his  dated  of
       birth.  Albeit that  these  questions  were   given  in  writing  the
       claimant gave the responses and went with his  foster  carer  to  the
       appointment in which experienced solicitors, JD Spicer, completed the
       questionnaire and the claimant declared the truth of the answers.  In
       oral evidence the claimant confirmed that he was  specifically  asked
       the various questions. The claimant advanced that  all  he  said  was
       that he did not have a taskera over here. He denied  he  was  blaming
       the lawyers for the answer given and asserted that the  question  was
       aimed at whether there was a taskera in the  United  Kingdom.  It  is
       quite clear that the question refers both to a taskera in the UK  and
       in Afghanistan because it asks if the document is in the UK.

  199. The explanation  of  how  he  chanced  upon  an  ex-care  leaver  who
       initially took him to Harrow's services is vague and unlikely  albeit
       not impossible. However, the claimant  gave  oral  evidence  that  he
       bumped into  another  Afghan  who  just  happened  to  recognise  the
       claimant from when he was a child and was a friend of his uncle's.  I
       can accept that Afghans might prefer to go to specific shops when  in
       London but to claim that he was recognised, that he missed his family
       and then fail to exchange  contact  details  because  he  was  buying
       orange juice was simply not credible particularly as he had indicated
       how much he missed his family.  This was his opportunity  to  explore
       some  renewed  contact  with  known  Afghans  and   possibly   obtain
       information on his family whom he has requested the Red Cross  trace,
       and his response when questioned on why he did not  exchange  details
       was finally 'I did give you an answer earlier'. In oral evidence, the
       claimant maintained that he did not have his details and did not  see
       the Afghan again after the first chance encounter. When, however, the
       age assessment declared the claimant to be  an  adult  and  when  the
       accommodation was about to be changed, the claimant's solicitor wrote
       to Social Services stating that he would rather stay with his uncle's
       friend.  I do not accept that the claimant would have initiated  that
       suggestion if he did not have the  details  and  simply  on  the  off
       chance that he might meet the friend again in the  shop  or  that  he
       said it because he was scared.

  200. Again the claimant displayed a sureness and deftness in answering the
       questions whilst at the same time either failing to answer  or  being
       vague on questions which were  more  problematic  for  him.  In  some
       respects, he could recall large sections of his past  in  detail  but
       when questions were less helpful, he failed to recall in a manner not
       consistent with his presented mental health.

  201. Mr Benfield was given permission to  question  the  claimant  on  the
       Bulgarian documentation which was ruled admissible. He stated that he
       did not know why the surname (family name) S***** had been given  and
       denied that he had ever given 1.1.2000 as a  date of birth to anyone.
       He accepted that he signed documents but could not remember how many.
       He also stated that he had never heard of Kargahi  as  a  place.   He
       accepted that some pages relating to the Border police  documentation
       contained his signature but that he was not given time  to  read  the
       documentation and that his order for release on 18th  September  2018
       was 'announced in Persian' when Pasto was his language.  He  did  not
       understand the interpretation.  As I noted, however, DK accepted that
       his foster carer (of Iranian descent) spoke to him in Persian when he
       first arrived.

  202. At the claimant's Asylum in-take interview conducted  at  Croydon  in
       July  2019,  the  claimant  had  an  interpreter  and  confirmed   he
       understood the questions. At question 19 of the interview it was  put
       to him that he had been fingerprinted in Bulgaria  and  he  explained
       his conversation with the interpreter in Bulgaria as follows,  'There
       was an interpreter and he said they were going to fingerprint me  and
       write down my details' ...'I told them my date of birth and they said
       it is ok we will write it down'.  That  was  an  interchange  not  of
       someone who had no understanding but of someone who could recall  and
       comprehend the interaction.   He added in that interview that he gave
       the same name and the same date of birth to the Bulgarian authorities
       i.e. 2004.   He made no mention when recalling the incident with  the
       interpreter in Bulgaria that he did not understand. At this interview
       in July 2019, he had legal representation in the form of JD Spicer.

  203. DK also stated in oral evidence that, with reference to the Bulgarian
       documentation, sometimes he signed in Pashto and sometimes in English
       but when the claimant was also asked 'were you aware of what date  of
       birth was in the documents?'  (which  was  indeed  in  the  Gregorian
       calendar) he replied 'no'.  The dates of birth are clearly written in
       English numerals. Further the claimant had confirmed that he knew his
       date of birth in both the Gregorian  and  the  Afghan  calendar  (his
       English proficiency included some reading).

  204. The claimant initially  stated  in  oral  evidence  that  when  first
       detained he gave not only his date of birth but also stated  how  old
       he was.   The  claimant  also  initially  stated  that  he  told  the
       interpreter his date of birth and how old he was  in  both  languages
       (English and Pashto).  He was asked to confirm this  in  the  hearing
       and did so.    The  claimant  then  contradicted  his  oral  evidence
       stating that he gave his date of  birth  in  Pashto  only.   He  then
       stated that he gave  English  dates  in  the  Pashto  language.   The
       claimant also stated that he did not  say  2004  in  English  but  in
       Pashto because there was an  interpreter  present.  DK  then  stated,
       finally, that he did not speak to them  in  English.   In  his  third
       statement, however, he had also confirmed that he had given his  date
       of birth in the Afghan and the Gregorian calendar.

  205. In effect  the  claimant  obfuscated  and  changed  his  evidence  to
       straightforward and simple questions.  Within  a  matter  of  minutes
       earlier, the claimant had  given  oral  evidence  that  he  told  the
       authorities his date of birth in English. The claimant could remember
       precisely how long he was in the jungle near Bulgaria (8 days)  prior
       to going into detention but could not  recall  how  long  he  was  in
       detention in Bulgaria. When challenged on this his response was 'I am
       not a computer".

  206. It is most unlikely that two different  Bulgarian  authorities  would
       make up a very similar name of S*****  and I find that the claimant's
       disavowal of this name to be improbable.   The claimant's evidence on
       this was not direct, was inconsistent and evasive, even  taking  into
       account his mental health difficulties.

  207. I was taken through extracts of reports in relation to the  Bulgarian
       authorities' treatment  of  detainees  and  asylum  seekers.  It  was
       advanced that the authorities deployed two  particular  tactics  when
       dealing with minors. First, they identified an  adult  to  whom  they
       attached the minor in  order  not  to  be  considered  unaccompanied.
       Alternatively, the minor was fixed with a date of birth of  eighteen.



  208. Ms Benfield submitted that although Mr Holbrook  relied  on  evidence
       which suggested the practice of detention of minors ceased as of July
       2018,  the AIDA report (Asylum Information Database Report) suggested
       that the detention of minors was ongoing.  The  AIDA  Country  report
       Bulgaria referred to this practice continuing and that such  children
       "are assigned ('attached') to any of the adults present in the  group
       with which the children travelled, which has been the steady practice
       ongoing for the last couple of years".

  209. As indicated, however, in the AIDA report, an amendment to  the  LARB
       regulations entered into force on 10 July 2018 (i.e. between the date
       of the previous reports of  EASO  and  when  DK  claimed  asylum)  to
       introduce rules and procedures for immediate and direct  referral  of
       unaccompanied  migrant  children  from  the  police  to   the   child
       protection services in order to avoid their  detention.   The  report
       referred to an immediate change in the national police  practices  on
       detention. That said, the practice appeared  to  continue  for  those
       considered to be between the  age  of  14  -  18  years  'the  police
       continue to employ detention through attached or registration  as  an
       adult'.

  210. DK, however, made no mention that he was attached to any  adult  when
       or after he was actually arrested, and this was not apparent  on  the
       face of any of the documentation. Albeit  he  states  he  was  guided
       through Europe by an agent, there was no  mention  of  the  agent  on
       detention or when claiming asylum.  The claimant's evidence regarding
       interpretation did not refer to the agent or any  other  accompanying
       adult being with him when detained in Bulgaria.

  211. With regard the second method,  Ms  Benfield  also  referred  to  the
       change in processing of age assessments in Europe by way of  the  two
       EASO reports (2013) and the second edition  (2018)  report  which  in
       fact was produced in April 2018 and prior to the  claimant's  arrest.
       It was submitted  that the authorities had only visually assessed the
       claimant and the reports showed the changing process. I was  provided
       with extracts of those reports and the  overview  of  the  safeguards
       included the principle of the  best  interests  of  the  child  being
       applied, an independent person supporting the claimant and a  variety
       of other procedural safeguards. I am not persuaded  that  this  takes
       the case further in the light of my other reasoning.

  212. It was thus suggested that he was 'given' the age  of  an  adult  and
       rushed through the process with inadequate interpretation.    I  note
       however  that  the  UNHCR  age  Gender  and  Diversity  Participatory
       Assessment Report noted that 2017 remarked on a 'dramatic decrease in
       the  number  of  asylum  applications  submitted  to  the   Bulgarian
       authorities from the  previous  year  and  also  referred  to  'multi
       functioning teams' consisting of 40 representatives of 18  state  and
       non-governmental entities involved in the participatory  overview  of
       'Access to Rights' in Bulgaria.  In other words not only was there  a
       marked decrease in the numbers being  processed  but  also  increased
       scrutiny of  the  Bulgarian  processes  by  various  non-governmental
       bodies and agencies in relation to  detention,  police  treatment  of
       asylum seekers and services including interpretation  at  the  border
       and in detention facilities  with  particular  reference  to  minors.
       There was reference to lack of interpretation but in  the  claimant's
       case the documents signed identified the use of an interpreter.

  213. Bearing in mind DK  could  understand  English,  read  the  Gregorian
       calendar and was spoken to in Persian by his  foster  carer  when  he
       first arrived, and confirmed he spoke in Pashto and  English  to  the
       authorities in Bulgaria, (which is an EU state), I do not accept that
       he did not have interpretation on detention nor failed to  understand
       sufficiently to transmit or understand his given year  of  birth  and
       name.

  214. The claimant's first name (as  opposed  to  surname)  was  given  and
       recorded correctly, and the naming elements were  in  English,  which
       the claimant can understand; he can read and write basic English  and
       his date of birth was on the documents handed to  him.   His  surname
       S***** is written in the Old Roman alphabet (English) rather than the
       Cyrillic alphabet  on  the  Bulgarian  documents  throughout  and  is
       clearly distinguishable next to  his  name  on  documents  which  the
       claimant signed. He must have been aware of this name.  The  claimant
       is clear in his witness statement that he himself  gave  the  details
       and in his oral evidence he confirmed signing if  not  all,  some  of
       them. This is not the name given by the claimant on entry to the UK.

  215. The documentation relates to two different time periods  and  events,
       the first relating to his detention and the second in relation to his
       asylum claim. Both place his date of birth in  2000.   This  year  of
       birth appears on the face of all of the documents relating to DK.  He
       may have missed the month of his birth, but  his  year  of  birth  is
       clear.  He asserted in his age assessment that he gave the  same  age
       to the Bulgarian authorities himself as he gave here.  The year  2004
       appears nowhere on  the  documents  whereas  the  year  2000  appears
       throughout.  I  find  it  to  be  speculation  that   the   Bulgarian
       authorities put that date down to make him 18 years old. The claimant
       managed to make his first name understood, and  asserts  the  surname
       was ascribed to him by  the  Bulgarian  authorities.   There  was  no
       explanation why those authorities should adopt  his  first  name  but
       give him a completely random surname not just on his first  detention
       but also two weeks later when he  claimed  asylum  and  was  free  to
       leave.  That the date of birth differed indicates a different process
       of taking information by a different body (the refugee  agency).  The
       year of birth remains constant.

  216. The UNHCR report referred to a lack of information and that  many  of
       the detainees were not aware of their legal options  and  the  asylum
       system.  From the letter from the Republic of Bulgaria  State  Agency
       of Refugees  with  the  Council  of  Ministers,  by  contrast,   this
       claimant engaged with the process as  it  is  shown  he  'lodged  his
       application  for  international  protection  with  the  Republic   of
       Bulgaria on 2.10  2018' and is then recorded as having 'absconded  on
       9th October 2018'.  In terms of the RSDP and reception conditions 'no
       cases were reported when applicants were  unable  to  understand  the
       interpreter'.

  217. The reports indicate a  considerable  oversight  and  involvement  of
       UNHCR and non-governmental organisations in the processes adopted  by
       Bulgaria and those processes by 2018 and, from the  reports  of  2017
       had  considerably  less  pressure  on  them.  Although   he   asserts
       mistreatment the claimant waited some days before  'absconding'  from
       the camp. An account consistent with pushbacks could emanate from  an
       adult just as a minor and does not add to the narrative.

  218. On balance I do not accept that the practice  simply  to  ascribe  an
       older age particularly as the claimant was with a large group  of  28
       when arrested, and there was clearly an option to attach  him  to  an
       adult, but his own account runs counter to that suggestion.  Secondly
       scrutiny of practices appeared to have  increased  and  thirdly,  not
       once but twice by different authorities within Bulgaria, the claimant
       was recorded as having been born in 2000.  The claimant's description
       of treatment developed  such  that  in  his  last  statement  it  was
       described as 'cruel' but even in  that  statement  he  accepted  that
       after the first camp he was fed and allowed to leave.  His  reference
       in his third statement to the 'cruelty' was to the two days he  spent
       in  detention  by  the  police.  He  makes  no  significant  specific
       complaint about the treatment when he claimed asylum on  2nd  October
       2018 to the Bulgarian Refugee agency.

  219. I find that there was  an  interpreter  when  DK  claimed  asylum  in
       Bulgaria and contrary to his statements to the social workers in  the
       age assessment, he did not give the same dates of birth, particularly
       the year, as he gave in the UK.

  220. On questioning about  his  contact  with  his  family  and  uncle  DK
       accepted that he was in touch with his uncle by telephone in Iran  as
       he travelled across Asia  but  stated  that  was  until  'the  number
       stopped working'.  The  handwritten  notes  recorded  that  the  'Sim
       stopped working'. That was repeated in oral  evidence.  The  claimant
       then said in oral evidence that he had the number on a piece of paper
       and when it stopped working, he threw it (the paper) away. It was put
       to him that it must have been stored on his phone, but he then denied
       he had a  mobile  phone  in  Afghanistan  and  that  he  learned  the
       Gregorian  calendar  from  other  classmates  who   had   phones   in
       Afghanistan. He denied he had a sim card even when he was  shown  the
       record of the age assessment where he referred to a  sim  card.    He
       repeated he only had the number on a piece of paper  which  he  threw
       away. That was a direct contradiction of his  previous  evidence.  Ms
       Benfield's  suggestion  that  he  was  obviously  referring  to   the
       'uncle's' sim card is not borne out by the context of the handwritten
       notes, the age assessment nor his own statement.

  221. He cannot have known that the sim card of the uncle stopped;  he  was
       referring to his own phone. It is not credible  that  every  time  he
       wished to phone his family, he would have had the opportunity or been
       able to borrow a phone during his travels. I do not accept that there
       was a contradiction between the handwritten notes and the  record  in
       the formal age assessment.

  222. I have factored in the claimant's mental health condition and that he
       was referred to counselling but do not accept that  it  explains  the
       changes in his evidence.  As Ms Benfield pointed out, he was able  to
       be consistent in certain aspects of his claim such as  him  being  14
       when he left Afghanistan and the number of days spent in  the  jungle
       outside Bulgaria.  When the evidence was less convenient,  he  either
       could not remember, denied saying what was written down or blamed  an
       interpreter.  Owing  to  the  frequency  and  importance   of   those
       particular errors I do not find that  the  claimant's  mental  health
       condition can explain them. There was no medical indication  that  he
       was unfit to give evidence and  he  had  no  reported  difficulty  in
       learning at college. Indeed, the class at Claremont  High  School  he
       considered the learning insufficiently advanced. He was able to  give
       lucid and articulate evidence,  understood  the  questions  and  even
       challenge them.

  223. The care plans and social work reports confirm that DK has been  able
       to attend college, attend the gym on a regular basis,  and  attend  a
       variety  of  appointments.  The  reports   indicated   a   level   of
       independence and ability to express  his  views  and  articulate  his
       rights at an early stage. The Horizon report from September 2019  for
       example reported him going to the mosque and  refusing  to  attend  a
       school preferring to wait for the age assessment to be  completed  to
       go to college.   I  accept  that  he  has  been  given  guidance  and
       assistance but nonetheless he has been able to engage with  and  make
       decisions on his affairs on a consistent and regular basis.

  224. The ADCS, which I note is guidance only, identifies that

'Foster carers, key workers, social care workers,  advocates,  teachers  and
       college tutors may be involved in  working  with  a  child  or  young
       person depending upon their circumstances and placement arrangements,
       and they are likely to have high levels of contact with the child  or
       young person.  Their observations of children  and  young  people  in
       different settings and interactions with peers and other  adults  can
       make a useful contribution to your assessments.  It is good  practice
       to gather the information  available  prior  to  conducting  the  age
       assessment interview(s) with the child or young person'.

Two of the criteria adopted in  AS v Kent in relation  to  opinion  evidence
       was that (i)  the witness should be impartial and  (ii)whether  there
       was a reliable body  of  knowledge  or  experience  to  underpin  the
       expert's evidence.

  225. With that in mind, I turn to the evidence of the  foster  carer,  Mrs
       Hosseinbor,  who  believed  that  the  claimant  was  a  minor.   Mrs
       Hosseinbor had the claimant living with her from  July  to  September
       2019 and again from November 2020 to present, and stated she was used
       to fostering  young  asylum  seekers.   It  was  suggested  that  the
       claimant's foster carer had an interest in maintaining the placement,
       affording her approximately �600 to �700 per week but I  believe  Mrs
       Hosseinbor gave evidence in good faith.  I would  not  disregard  her
       evidence on impartiality grounds because she was in receipt of  funds
       for DK's placement.

  226. She herself, however, accepted  that  she  had  no  training  in  age
       assessment. She confirmed in her statement of 30th January 2020  that
       she thought DK 16 and inter alia he did not brush his teeth  and  his
       cooking skills were limited.  As pointed out by Mr Poole, DK did  not
       see  a  dentist  in  Afghanistan  and  as  the  claimant  stated  his
       grandfather, with whom he lived,  had  servants.  Together  with  the
       cultural influences regarding domestic  tasks  the  evidence  of  the
       claimant's domestic skills does not assist.

  227. She confirmed on questioning she had proceeded on the assumption that
       the claimant was the age that he claimed, and which had been given to
       and by the agency.  Clearly, the agency operated on the basis that it
       was placing those below the age of 18  and  remunerating  the  foster
       carers accordingly.  I give  limited weight, however, to her evidence
       on the basis that she has not been trained as an age assessor and she
       proceeded on the basis of the age given to her.  I accept her role is
       to consider his needs rather than question the  claimant's  account's
       credibility and age when that  is  not  her  function.   Indeed,  she
       acknowledged that she  had  previously  had  those  aged  19  in  her
       household and although she acknowledged that she could  not  be  sure
       that he was 15 or 16 or 17 she said she could say he was not 18.

  228.  In  her  email  dated  18th  October   2019   to   the   appellant's
       representative she wrote that 'they may get lines on the face because
       of the climate and the hard work they have done  from  a  very  young
       age'.  This was not the account of the  claimant.   His  account  was
       that his grandfather  was  a  landowner  with  two  'big'  farms  and
       servants, and he attended a school and then private school until  not
       long before his departure at the age of 14 years.  According  to  his
       statement of 8th July 2020 he had only one year in the fields.

  229. The evidence of Ms Nagiah, the  administrator  for  the  agency,  was
       challenged on the basis that it was not  in  the  agency's  financial
       interests to question age  of  those  being  placed.  The  defendant,
       however, commissioned the placement and  I consider that  the  agency
       would merely proceed on the basis of the age  given  by  and  to  the
       commissioning authority.  According to her statement of 24th  January
       2020 she saw DK only four times and it is clear that  her  focus  was
       the foster carer herself rather than DK.  Further, she herself stated
       that she was not best qualified to provide a specific assessment  for
       D's age.  She thought that he was  developing  self-care  skills  and
       needed help with important meetings but was 'otherwise able to manage
       some meetings himself'. I afford limited weight to her evidence.

  230. Mr Poole was criticised, and, in part, permission was granted on  the
       basis that he had failed to take into account the views and  opinions
       of the foster carer and Ms  Nagiah.  Those  opinions,  however,  were
       clearly  sought  by  the  defendant  as  witnessed   by   the   email
       correspondence of Ms Nasinza on  behalf  of  the  London  Borough  of
       Harrow. Indeed, Mr Poole was copied into the requests.  In  his  oral
       evidence, Mr Poole was quite clear that he was aware of  the  opinion
       of the foster carer that the claimant was under the  age  of  18  and
       that the administrator for the care agency, Ms Nagiah, considered the
       claimant was a minor. He confirmed that he  took  this  into  account
       notwithstanding that it was not actually written into the assessment.
       The email records show that their views were solicited prior  to  the
       decision.  Indeed, as Mr Poole explained,  he  did  not  specifically
       refer in the assessment to the evidence of the initial social  worker
       Susan Nasinza, who had assessed the claimant as being over the age of
       18.

  231. I preface my observations on the social workers' evidence by  stating
       that all gave a range of ages.  They were definitive,  however,  that
       he was not a minor but an adult despite their various  views  on  how
       much of an adult he was.

  232. As the caselaw  indicates  age  assessments  are,  by  their  nature,
       imprecise. Mr Poole gave the claimant an age range of  between  21-25
       years in the age assessment and had  settled  at  23  as  being  most
       likely whilst the other social  worker,  Mr  Kato,  had  thought  the
       claimant between 23 -28 years.

  233. Mr Steventon had not encountered the claimant at the time of the  age
       assessment but was also firm in his evidence as  a  qualified  social
       worker who had undertaken age assessments himself, that the  claimant
       was over the age of 18 albeit he accepted DK could be 'compliant'.  I
       give weight to Mr Steventon's opinion which was balanced in  that  he
       thought the claimant presented as independent although he did  accept
       that he could be compliant.  I note by the time he met  the  claimant
       he had already been the UK for at least a year. He had given  an  age
       range of between 21 and 23 years.

  234. The verbal opinion of the tutor  at  the  Greenway  Project  on  11th
       November 2019, was recorded in a  case  note  by  Mr  Poole  on  13th
       November 2019 and confirmed in an exhibit to his  statement.   As  Mr
       Poole stated, many professionals are reluctant to commit their  views
       to writing and, on this occasion, albeit her  view  was  based  on  a
       cursory meeting, is not to be wholly discounted, particularly as this
       project was specifically set up to meet the  needs  of  young  asylum
       seekers learning English and her view was recorded at  the  time  and
       there was no apparent contradiction and no challenge to this note.  I
       accept however there  was  little  by  way  of  evidence  as  to  her
       qualifications and experience. She thought him '20+'.

  235. This contrasts with the social worker Mr Holmes-Attivor, who in  fact
       refused to make firm his views that the  claimant  was  a  minor  and
       despite numerous emails from Mr Poole requesting that  he  place  his
       views in writing he declined to do so.  There was on record a note of
       a telephone call with him on 9th December 2019 stating that Mr Holmes-
       Attivor stated he had no experience or knowledge of  age  assessments
       and did not want to get involved and that he said he would  put  this
       and his views in an email.  He did not do so.  His  views  have  only
       been represented.  What I do know is that he was  involved  with  the
       claimant's  care,  was  specifically  requested  by  email  by   both
       representatives to give his opinion as a social worker in writing  as
       to whether the claimant was an adult or not and declined to do so.  I
       am surprised that, as a social worker, he did not back up his opinion
       in writing because he must have been aware of the implications, and I
       therefore attach little weight to his  verbal  opinion,  even  though
       represented, that the claimant was a minor.

  236. What is noticeable is the absence of evidence from any  other  tutor,
       bearing in mind the claimant had attended college since  the  end  of
       18th November 2019.  As the ADCS  guidelines  indicate,  a  range  of
       views including those from tutors will assist in  assessing  age.   I
       realise that the claimant may well  have  attended  college  remotely
       since the lockdown in March 2020, but nonetheless he  has  come  into
       contact with tutors at the  college  in  late  2019  and  indeed  has
       attended  because  he  was  stated  to  have   been   elected   class
       representative in 2020.

  237. I am not persuaded that the dentist's evidence assists one way or the
       other. I accept that data sets  can  be  unreliable  particularly  if
       there are no comparable ethnic groups within the analysed statistics.
        Albeit the claimant had a fully  erupted  third  molar  said  to  be
       consistent with the status of an adult,  case  law  cautions  placing
       reliability on such evidence. Even though the dentist had  previously
       advised that the dental presentation of the claimant was that  of  an
       adult she only stated in writing that he was 'at least 15 years old',
       which appeared to be contradictory and would not be drawn further  on
       a previous conversation with the social worker. I have no  reason  to
       disbelieve the oral conversation related by the  social  worker  with
       the dentist in relaying that the  claimant  had  a  dental  structure
       suggesting he was over the age of 18 but there was contradiction, and
       therefore  this  takes  the  case  no  further  forward  as  to   age
       assessment.  All that can be said is that it does  not  detract  from
       the opinion of the social workers that the claimant is over  the  age
       of 18 years.

  238. In relation to the historical  photographic  evidence  I  agree  that
       reliance on photographs  is  not  necessarily  helpful  to  show  the
       heaviness of his beard  or  receding  hairline  or  age  because  the
       lighting, exposure and other conditions can make such a difference to
       photographic presentation.

  239. The information on the Red Cross takes the case  no  further  forward
       for the defendant.  The claimant stated that he had asked  them  many
       times, but they did not have any information. I can accept  that  the
       Red Cross will not trace where they  are  not  operational,  and  the
       request simply lies on the file. I would add that the Red Cross  will
       only be able to trace with the correct name.

  240. I turn to the content of the age assessment.   When  considering  the
       age assessment R (AM) v Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council  (AAJR)
       [2012] UKUT 0018 counsels against reliance on  demeanour  and  social
       interactions  in  the  course  of  a  short  interview  between   'an
       individual and a strange adult' [19].

  241. Following R (AM), great caution must be given to physical attributes.
        At the date of the age assessment under challenge  it  was  recorded
       that DK shaved regularly and had a developed Adam's  apple  and  thus
       had the attributes of being fully grown.  The  authorities  establish
       that physical appearance is an unreliable indicator of age, but R (B)
       v Merton does not exclude that consideration merely that the decision-
       maker cannot determine age solely on the basis of the  appearance  of
       the claimant.  The observations thus can be taken  into  account  and
       they add to the picture. There  was  not  however  mere  reliance  on
       appearance and demeanour.

  242. The age assessment itself refers to a variety of  factors  that  were
       taken into account in addition to references to  physical  appearance
       and demeanour. It was noted that an initial hypothesis of age may  be
       formed on the basis  of  height,  facial  features,  voice  tone  and
       general impression.  The assessors also noted that it  was  important
       to consider racial differences  and  that  it  was  "normal  in  some
       cultures for boys to have facial hair at an early age".  It was  also
       noted that "life experiences and trauma  may  impact  on  the  ageing
       process" and this should be borne in mind, together with the  culture
       of the country of origin and events preceding the interview,  journey
       and experiences.  Thus it is evident the assessment does not rely  on
       physical appearance and demeanour alone.

  243. The initial impression of the claimant was that he had lines  on  his
       face, his hair was receding at the side of his  forehead,  he  had  a
       pronounced Adam's apple and had the appearance of a  young  man  aged
       between 25 and 28 years of age.  He was  short  and  five  foot  five
       inches and weighed just under nine stone.  There was no challenge  to
       the actual description. His interaction  during  the  assessment  was
       someone who was considered to be calm and confident and who  provided
       responses to each question and did  not  seem  to  be  distressed  by
       exploring past events.

  244. The claimant reported that he  lived  in  a  district  named  "Khaga"
       (similar to the name of the town from which DK stated his grandfather
       was said to have secured his taskera) and he gave  the  ages  of  his
       grandfather, mother, father, brother and sister.

  245. The assessment went through the history the claimant gave  and  noted
       the contradiction between the claimant's information that  Daesh  had
       taken over the area but at the  same  time  the  grandfather's  local
       house was locked down by the government. I was  urged  to  find  that
       there was a consistency  between  the  claimant's  account  of  being
       forcibly recruited and  the  external  information  for  example  the
       Landinfo report.  It is not for me to analyse aspects of  the  asylum
       claim but, as it was pointed out by the social workers, there  was  a
       contradiction that government forces would focus on the grandfather's
       house rather than the Daesh compound when they were both  local.  His
       story that Daesh released him to  visit  his  family  jars  with  the
       concept of forcible recruitment.

  246. There were more telling contradictions relied upon not least the time
       spent on his journey and his language ability.

  247. The age assessment reiterated his account of  his  of  travel  noting
       that he left Afghanistan on 11th July 2018,  (his  departure  was  26
       days after Eid al-Fitr, that is, on  or  around  10th  or  11th  July
       2018),  he spent two days in Pakistan, took  a  month  to  travel  to
       Turkey, where he spent a month, and left Turkey in mid-September 2018
       and travelled to Bulgaria, where he stayed for  seventeen  days.   He
       took a day to travel to Serbia, where he  stayed  for  four  to  five
       months and therefore left Serbia in early March 2019  and  took  four
       days to travel to Calais, where he remained a month  before  entering
       the UK.   This calculated his entry to  the  UK  in  mid-April  2019.
       However, he presented himself on 10th July 2019 and thus  there  were
       three months unaccounted, which is a large percentage  of  a  twelve-
       month journey.

  248. It was then noted that he changed his  account  of  his  journey  and
       stated that he spent six months in Serbia and six months  in  Calais.
       (It had been noted that previously he  did  not  remember  travelling
       through France). It was open  to  the  age  assessors  to  take  this
       "slippage" or change of account into the assessment.

  249. The age assessment also took into account  that  the  claimant  could
       speak and understand English to a higher level than he had stated  on
       entry and he could read and write basic  English.   It  was  recorded
       that he had told the education authority he did not speak English.

  250. In relation to his education DK recounted that he went to  the  Zawar
       Private School, which he attended when he was 6 years old,  and  that
       he left after seven years and did not attend school  thereafter.   He
       attended a short course in Afghanistan  for  English.   He  confirmed
       that he could read and write basic English and that he was  12  years
       old when he started the course. When asked about the  proficiency  of
       his English he maintained that he had learnt English from his  'aunt'
       (Mrs Hosseinbor) in the UK and back in Afghanistan, where he  studied
       English for three months.

  251. It was open to the assessors to conclude  that  his  account  of  his
       studying English in Afghanistan for three months was  not  consistent
       with his level of English, which was  beyond  that  one  would  speak
       after three months of study.  The claimant stated  that  he  had  met
       people in the past year who spoke English, and  that  helped  him  to
       learn English. He had, however, only been with  the  foster  carer  a
       matter of two months before the commencement of  the  age  assessment
       and he describes travelling and  being  in  camps  with  Afghans  and
       Iranians passing through a range of non-English  speaking  countries.
       Further, the claimant had denied to the local education authority  he
       could speak English and thus was sent to attend the Greenway  Project
       attached to Claremont School in  Kingsbury,  a  course  designed  for
       people who did not speak English or whose age  was  questioned.   The
       indication is that  the  claimant  had  spent  much  longer  learning
       English. In this particular instance the question of  the  claimant's
       ability in languages does throw doubt on the length  of  his  travels
       and thus his age.

  252. Further, it was considered that the claimant  was  fingerprinted  and
       detained in Bulgaria and kept in a camp with people aged  between  11
       and 25.  It was not accepted that he would be kept with  an  11-year-
       old  as  this  was  explicitly  prohibited  for  vulnerable  persons.
       Although Ms Benfield criticised this line  of  analysis  because  the
       Bulgarians did continue to detain those underage, I consider that  it
       was still open to the social workers  to  reject  that  the  claimant
       would be kept with someone as young as 11 and  unaccompanied  minors.
       Such detention is  indeed  against  the  Bulgarian  regulations.   As
       indicated previously, there appeared to be considerable oversight  by
       non-governmental organisations of camps in Bulgaria by 2018.

  253. Finally, the age assessment considered that the claimant,  when  told
       that he had been assessed as 23 years  old,  asked  if  the  decision
       could be changed if he provided an ID document and it was put to  him
       that he had maintained throughout his age assessment that he  had  no
       way of obtaining any such documents from back home. He also  reported
       that he had a taskera in Afghanistan but was unable to  bring  it  to
       the UK.  When asked about whether there was anyone, he could  contact
       to send him ID documents he said that people in the area did not know
       about social media and there was no signal in the area, so  he  could
       not contact anyone  back  home.   This  contrasts  sharply  with  the
       account of being able to contact his uncle at  least  from  Iran  and
       that boys in his class at school had mobile phones.  It  is  recorded
       that he had his uncle's contact number until they reached Iran.

  254. In effect, the overall age assessment relied on  various  factors  as
       explained above and was conducted by two experienced social  workers.
       Mr Poole did not, in his oral evidence depart from the age assessment
       nor his witness statements.  The criticisms made of his evidence  did
       not seriously erode the credibility of his statements.

  255. The CLA health report  dated  6th  August  2019  described  that  the
       claimant was 163 centimetres in height. This was taken  at  a  health
       assessment.  On 4th November 2020 some 15 months later his height was
       recorded as being 162.7cm.  Ms Benfield argued  that  AM  v  Solihull
       required an 18-month gap between measurements and  the  heights  were
       clearly incorrect as there could not be a reduction and  A  v  London
       Borough  of  Croydon  [2009]  EWHC  939  (Admin),   emphasised   that
       measurements  should  be  based   on   formal   clinical   paediatric
       quantification. As set out at paragraph 25, when citing evidence from
       a medical expert

     'Measurements of height and weight  are  in  his  view  not  completely
           reliable unless carried out by  a  properly  trained  paediatric
           auxologist. In any event, assessments of growth and maturity are
           in his view  unacceptably  unreliable.  Height  is  particularly
           difficult to use as a reliable indication since much will depend
           on the height of each parent.' [my underlining].

  256. The measurements here, however, are not reading off or comparing data
       from another data set but assessing the  data  with  respect  to  the
       claimant's  own  history  and  measurements.    Simple   measurements
       conducted by healthcare professionals form the basis of  a  range  of
       medical assessments and are clearly of medical value  otherwise  they
       simply would not be undertaken. Here there is a lack of  evidence  of
       growth at the age of 15 years over a 15-month period. AM  v  Solihull
       acknowledged that physical maturity may take place  'more  slowly  in
       conditions of poverty' such that after arrival change may take  place
       more quickly.  AM v Solihull in fact referred  to  the  time  between
       measurements as 'over a considerable period of time (say 18 months or
       more)'.  The timing was not  definitive.   Height,  however,  is  not
       determinative and merely a fragment in the picture but  the  claimant
       has not grown, at the claimed age  of  15  years,  over  a  15  month
       period. What is clear from A v London Borough of Croydon  is  that  a
       local authority would be criticised if all medical evidence were  not
       taken into account.

  257. In  sum,  the  evidence  weighs  against  the  claimant.   Three  age
       assessment trained social  workers  with  experience,  assessed  this
       claimant to be over the age of 18 and variously between the  ages  of
       21 to 26.  The independent documentary evidence despite  its  alleged
       shortcomings from the Bulgarian authorities identified this  claimant
       as having given information on claiming asylum that he was  over  the
       age of 18 and born in 2000. Even if the detention  reports  from  the
       border police are ignored, I consider the Bulgarian State Agency  for
       Refugees would be more thorough. That organisation was particular  on
       querying the name and  identity  of  the  claimant  before  releasing
       information. The claimant criticised the interpretation, but  I  have
       dealt with those criticisms above.

  258. Further, the details recorded by  the  Bulgarian  asylum  authorities
       differ from those identified by the border police and  recorded  over
       two weeks later after his detention by the border police in the first
       camp.  During the later period he relates that he was free to go  and
       indeed  left.   There  was  no  detention  and  thus   no   detention
       restriction imperative on the part of the Bulgarian authorities, when
       recording his asylum claim, to classify  him  as  an  adult  for  the
       purposes of detention records.

  259. The Bulgarian State Agency for Refugees was reluctant to engage  with
       the further subject access request because they did not  believe  the
       claimant's identity as he had given a different name.

  260. This claimant maintains that he was at school for a mere seven years,
       attended an English school for three months  studying  basic  English
       but during the course of his interviews with social  workers  and  as
       recorded in the papers, could speak Pashto and  was  conversant  with
       Dari and Urdu and confirmed that he spoke  Persian  with  his  foster
       carer and latterly English.  I do not accept that the claimant  could
       merely have absorbed the ability to speak these languages within  one
       year of travel from Afghanistan, particularly  English.   I  consider
       the age assessment to have weight in that respect.  Indeed his travel
       history places him with Iranians and Afghani.

  261. Not least, there were considerable inconsistencies  in  his  evidence
       which  undermined  his  credibility,  which  as  the  representatives
       submitted, is important.   There  were  a  number  of  flaws  in  the
       evidence notwithstanding the latitude given for  the  claimant  being
       classified as a vulnerable witness.  Indeed, during the course of the
       hearing,  as  noted,  he  was  able  to  understand  questions,  make
       responses, make observations and comments  on  those  questions  and,
       unprompted and spontaneously, raise questions himself.  On his  first
       night with the social worker having been told by the  son  to  remain
       indoors he left to 'check out' the area. He had been in this country,
       as he claimed, only for a matter of days.

  262. I assess the evidence holistically, particularly in the light  of  my
       analysis of the claimant's  evidence,  the  age  assessment  and  the
       documentation provided from Bulgaria. Mr Poole was well-qualified and
       had sufficient experience and expertise in age assessments to give  a
       valid opinion to which weight can be attached. He was experienced  to
       the point that by the time he gave oral evidence at the  Tribunal  he
       had indeed retired. That local authority documentation may  not  have
       been provided at the outset was not the responsibility of  Mr  Poole.
       The assessment was conducted over a series of meetings not just in  a
       short period but over a period of time.  Age assessment, however,  is
       not a precise science.  It may be that DK's time spent in school  was
       correct but that does not necessarily confirm his date of  birth.   I
       find that the claimant is on the evidence older than he  claims.   Mr
       Poole, Ms Nasinza and Mr Steventon all  gave  DK's  youngest  age  as
       being 21 years in September 2019. The tutor at Greenway  put  him  at
       nearer 20.

  263. I do accept the social worker's evidence that  DK  was  an  adult  on
       entering the UK and I find his age is close to the range given by the
       social workers' assessments albeit slightly younger. I find  that  he
       was born on the date on which he gave when he was documented claiming
       asylum in Bulgaria, and which ties in with the evidence he gave  that
       calculates that he was born in the month of March. In  October  2018,
       the claimant had given a date  of  birth  to  the  Bulgarian  Refugee
       Agency as being March 2000.  He turned 19 years in March 2019 and was
       approaching 20 years when assessed. His date of birth is  12th  March
       2000 as given to the Bulgarian asylum authorities.

  264. There was considerable criticism of the local authority  for  failure
       to provide relevant documentation at the commencement of the judicial
       review  proceedings.  The  defendant,  I  note,  submitted  that  the
       omission of various opinions was in  error  and  they  accepted  that
       there was a duty of candour.  There was no indication  that  relevant
       documentation was not before the Tribunal at the date of the hearing.



  265. What I say next is not held against the claimant.  DK  knew  in  July
       2019 that he had been fingerprinted in Bulgaria in October 2018.   No
       request was made to the relevant authorities  until  late  2020,  and
       that was by the defendant requesting the TCU to  respond.   Following
       receipt of the relevant document, its admission was challenged  until
       the day of  the  hearing.  When  making  age  assessment  challenges,
       potential claimants should promptly be making subject access requests
       of those nations through  which  they  have  passed  and  have  given
       details including fingerprints.

  266. Documentation is relevant where it relates directly  to  the  details
       given by the claimant to, for example, EU member states as to age and
       identity on detention or in an asylum claim outside the UK.  Relevant
       documents which are reasonably  available,  and  EU  authorities  are
       obliged to respond to a subject data request under Article 15 of  the
       GDPR, should be placed before the court to assist and  enable  it  to
       make just and fair decisions in  age  assessments.  Whereas  in  this
       case, an applicant has known since  mid-2019  that  his  fingerprints
       were taken in Bulgaria in 2018 and he is  legally  represented,  (his
       representatives were instructed in late 2019), an expectation of such
       a  written request for records is  proportionate  and  fair  and  may
       assist either party; it may also avoid  adjournments.   At  the  very
       least, the evidence of a prompt written request by a claimant  to  EU
       authorities, which by their nature have to be GDPR  compliant, might
       be expected in order to show  that  a  claimant  has  endeavoured  to
       secure  relevant  documentation;  that  expectation   is   fair   and
       proportionate.

  267. As indicated above the claimant's date of birth is 12th March 2000.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
       Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
       granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly  or
       indirectly identify him or any member of his family.  This  direction
       applies both to the appellant and  to  the  respondent.   Failure  to
       comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to  contempt   of   court
       proceedings.
