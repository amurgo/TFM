For the Appellants:    Mr. V. Makol of Maalik & Co.
For  the  Respondent:             Mr.  L.  Tarlow,  Home  Office  Presenting
                            Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. These are linked appeals against the decisions of First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge M  A  Khan  promulgated  on  3  February  2014,  dismissing  the
      Appellants' appeals against the Respondent's decisions dated  1  March
      2013 to refuse entry clearances as the wife and children of Mr  Bhajan
      Singh ('the sponsor'), a naturalised British citizen.


Background

   2. The Appellants are nationals of India. Mrs Paramjeet Kaur was born  on
      20 August 1970 and is the sponsor's wife. Ms Sukhjinder Kaur was  born
      on 22 October 1995 and is the daughter of the sponsor  and  the  First
      Appellant. Master Gurpreet Singh was born on 18 November 1997  and  is
      the son of the sponsor and the First Appellant. On  12  November  2012
      applications for entry clearance were made as the wife and children of
      the sponsor. The applications were refused  for  reasons  set  out  in
      respective Notices of Immigration Decision dated  1  March  2013:  Mrs
      Kaur's application was refused with particular reference to paragraphs
      E-ECP.2.6 and 2.10 (genuine and subsisting relationship, intention  to
      live together permanently in UK),  E-ECP.3.1 (financial requirements),
      and paragraph E-ECP.4.1 (English language requirement) of Appendix  FM
      of the Immigration Rules; the  children's  applications  were  refused
      essentially 'in-line' with their mother's application  with  reference
      to paragraphs E-ECC.1.6 and 2.1.


   3. The Appellants appealed to the IAC. Their appeals were  dismissed  for
      reasons set out in the determination the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,
      both under the Immigration Rules and on  human  rights  grounds  (with
      reference to Article 8 of the ECHR).


   4. The Appellants sought permission to appeal which was granted by First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Osborne on 3 April 2014.


Error of Law

   5. Mr Tarlow accepted on behalf of the  Respondent  that  the  Judge  had
      erred both in his consideration of the  appeal  under  the  Rules  and
      under Article 8.


   6.  In  respect  of  the  Rules  it  was  common   ground   between   the
      representatives that the Judge's conclusion at  paragraph  23  of  the
      determination that the marital relationship between  the  sponsor  and
      the First Appellant was subsisting and genuine, was  not  reconcilable
      with the conclusion stated at paragraph 26 that  the  First  Appellant
      did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  E-ECP.2.6.  However,
      equally, it was common ground between the  representatives  that  this
      error was immaterial because the  appeal  under  the  Rules  had  been
      expressly conceded on behalf of the Appellants before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal : see paragraph 6. Indeed, Mr Makol confirmed to me that  the
      Appellants could not succeed under the  Rules  because  the  sponsor's
      income level was insufficient, the documents submitted in  support  of
      the application were  deficient,  and  the  First  Appellant  had  not
      satisfied the requirements of the Rules relating to proficiency in the
      English language.


   7. In respect  of  Article  8,  whilst  Mr  Tarlow  maintained  that  the
      Respondent supported the Judge's  conclusion,  he  accepted  that  the
      Judge's approach and reasoning  were  inadequate  to  an  extent  that
      required the decision to be set aside and re-made. In  light  of  this
      concession, which in my judgement was properly made, I do not  propose
      to descend to any great  detail.  Suffice  to  say  that  it  is  only
      necessary to read the single paragraph, paragraph  27,  in  which  the
      Judge addressed Article 8 to comprehend the perfunctory nature of  the
      analysis which does not refer to,  or  follow,  any  of  the  relevant
      guidance from case law (for example Razgar), and did not  address  the
      particular submissions made to the Judge in  reliance  upon  the  then
      applicable  judgement  in  MM  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin).


   8. In the circumstances I find that there were material errors of law  on
      the  part  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of   both   the
      consideration under the Rules and the ECHR. The determination must  be
      set aside and is required to be re-made.


Remaking the decision

   9. Directions were issued to the parties that they should prepare for the
      hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the  basis  that   if   the
      determination of the First-tier Tribunal  was  to  be  set  aside  any
      further evidence, including supplementary oral evidence, may  need  to
      be considered at the same hearing. Mr Makol, however, raised the issue
      of MM being  outstanding  before  the  Court  of  Appeal.  I  was  not
      persuaded that this was a sound basis upon which to adjourn: there was
      some issue as to whether the Appellants could succeed pursuant to  the
      High Court judgement in MM in any event and it  was  generally  agreed
      that the outcome in the Court  of  Appeal  was  unlikely  to  be  more
      favourable to applicants than held by the High Court. In  all  of  the
      circumstances, I was satisfied that it was appropriate to  proceed  to
      remake the decision in the Upper Tribunal on the available evidence.


  10. For the reasons already identified above,  it  is  accepted  on  their
      behalf that the Appellants did not meet the financial requirements  of
      the Rules at the date of the Respondent's decision, and moreover  that
      the First Appellant did not satisfy the English language requirement.


  11. For the avoidance of any doubt, Mr Tarlow did not seek  to  go  behind
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge's finding in respect of the  genuineness
      of the marital relationship. However, even where paragraphs  E-ECP.2.6
      and 2.10 were satisfied in respect of the First Appellant, in  all  of
      the circumstances I find that the decisions  of  the  Respondent  were
      otherwise in accordance with the Immigration Rules, and the appeals of
      each of the Appellants under the Rules are accordingly dismissed.


  12. I turn to a consideration of the Appellants'  cases  by  reference  to
      Article 8.


  13. I take as a starting point that the Immigration Rules are drafted with
      the intent of striking a proportionate balance between the family  and
      private life of applicants and sponsors  and  the  protection  of  the
      public interest by maintaining effective immigration control.


  14. I have had regard to the extensive jurisprudence that has developed in
      this area, and approach this case by  reference  to  the  guidance  in
      Razgar, and  also  with  regard  in  particular  to  the  more  recent
      considerations  of  the  applicable  principles  subsequent   to   the
      amendments to the Immigration Rules that introduced Appendix FM  as  a
      reflection of the Secretary of State for the Home  Department's  views
      as to the balance to be  struck  between  the  right  to  respect  for
      private and family life and the legitimate aim to protecting  national
      security, public safety and the economic well-being  of  the  UK,  the
      prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health and  morals,
      and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (see  Appendix
      FM at GEN.1.1). Recent case law  has  been  helpfully  considered  and
      analysed in Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct approach)  [2013]
      UKUT 00640 (IAC), and  I  note  in  particular  the  summary  of  that
      distillation at paragraph 24.


  15. Mr Makol, on behalf of the Appellants placed particular reliance  upon
      the various observations of the High Court in MM  in  respect  of  the
      requirements of Appendix FM in relation to finances.


  16. However, the difficulty the Appellants encounter with this approach is
      that the sponsor's income and expenditure figures as presented in  the
      statements and supporting evidence are not readily reconcilable.


  17. I note the following matters:

(i) In the visa application form it is said that  the  sponsor's  income  is
      �1700 per month - which equates to an annual figure (x 12) of �20,400.
      However, an annual income figure, both for the last 12 months and  for
      the last financial year, is given as �22,000.

(ii) In his witness statement signed on 8 January 2014 the sponsor  declared
      that he earned approximately �22,000 in the last financial  year,  and
      that in the last two years he had earned a total of �42,000 (paragraph
      12).

(iii) In his sponsorship declaration signed on 11  July  2012,  the  sponsor
      stated that he lived in  a  three  bedroom  property,  adding  "I  pay
      �950.00 per calendar month as rental". He also stated that  he  earned
      approximately  �300  per  week,  and  sent  �6500  per  annum  to  the
      Appellants in India. �300 per week is equivalent to �1300  per  month,
      not �1700 as declared in the visa application form. Even  so,  on  the
      assumption that the figures provided in  the  sponsorship  declaration
      are accurate, and on the assumption that the �300 per week  figure  is
      after-tax, the sponsor would be left with �3200 per annum after paying
      his rent - which is not reconcilable with the concept of sending �6500
      per year to India to support his family.

(iv) The sponsor's claimed income is not reflected in the business  accounts
      prepared by his accountant and submitted with the application.

(v) Although a 'sales' figure of �14,334 is given for  the  6  month  period
      from 1 October 2011 to 31 March 2012, the profit from these  sales  is
      given as �6895. It is this figure of �6895 that was declared to the  H
      M Revenue and Customs in  the  sponsors  2011/2012  tax  return.  This
      equates to a weekly income of about �265 - i.e. less than that claimed
      in his sponsorship declaration.

(vi) Further, this profit projected forward would give an annual  income  of
      �13,790. The basic 'target' figure extrapolated from  the  High  Court
      judgement in MM is �13,500: but that is for an applicant seeking to be
      joined only by a spouse  or  partner,  and  so  would  require  to  be
      adjusted in light of two children being included in  the  application.
      Under the Rules this leads to an  increase  from  �18,600  to  �24,800
      (i.e. 2 x 1/6); applying the same ratio to the MM  figure  of  �13,500
      would produce a target figure of �18,000. The  sponsor's  own  figures
      fall short of such a 'target'.

(vii) A further set of accounts were prepared  in  support  of  the  appeal,
      dated 20 July 2013, and for the tax year ended 5 April 2013. This  set
      shows a gross income of �21,934, but a profit of only  �9113  -  which
      equates to approximately �175 per week, and  is  not  even  enough  to
      cover the rent on the property it  is  proposed  that  the  Appellants
      reside in with the sponsor.

(viii) It is manifest from the above that the sponsor has  repeatedly  based
      his claimed income figure on the turnover of his business, rather than
      his actual personal  income  derived  from  self-employment.  Such  an
      approach is in error, and has resulted in a fundamental  misconception
      in the presentation of the Appellants' applications and appeals.

(ix) Moreover, the sponsor's actual declared derived income -  (declared  by
      way of his accounts and to the Revenue) - is not readily  reconcilable
      with his claimed expenditures on rent and remittances to India.


  18.  In  light  of  the  above,  Mr  Makol  informed  me,   having   taken
      instructions, that the sponsor currently shared the accommodation with
      two others, and so he only actually paid �300 towards the monthly rent
      of �950. That may be so (although there is no supporting  evidence  on
      point): however, it makes no difference to the fact that the sponsor's
      declared  income  level  is  substantially  below  that  mooted  as  a
      reasonable level by the High Court in MM. Nor  does  it  appropriately
      anticipate the situation upon the arrival of the Appellants:  in  this
      context, the adequacy of the accommodation has been  advanced  on  the
      basis that it would be exclusively occupied by  the  sponsor  and  the
      Appellants and nowhere is there  any  suggestion  that  other  persons
      might be residing with them. As things  stand,  and  for  the  reasons
      already given, the sponsor's income at the date  of  the  Respondent's
      decision would not have been sufficient to cover  the  cost  of  rent,
      even before meeting any other expenses.


  19. In the alternative, Mr Makol directed my attention  to  the  sponsor's
      savings. However, it is to be noted, even  allowing  for  an  adjusted
      rent figure of �300 per month (�3600 per annum). This is  not  readily
      reconcilable with the notion of being able to send �6500 per annum  to
      the Appellants in India, on an income of �9113. Necessarily it becomes
      unclear how the sponsor has been able to accrue  any  savings  at  all
      through his self-employment in the UK.


  20. In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the sponsor has made
      a full and frank disclosure of his income and expenditure. I find  his
      figures to be  unreliable.  In  any  event,  his  declared  income  is
      substantially below that even mooted in MM as a reasonable amount  for
      a British citizen to demonstrate in order to be joined by a spouse.


  21. I accept that the fact of marriage evidences family  life  as  between
      the First Appellant  and  sponsor,  and  in  turn  between  the  minor
      Appellants and their father. Necessarily the quality  of  that  family
      life has been substantially diminished by the  sponsor's  election  to
      remain in the UK without any proper status until such time as  he  was
      successful  in  securing   leave   through   the   'legacy'   process.
      Nonetheless, I accept that  the  Respondent's  decisions  prevent  the
      resumption of a closer family life in the  UK.  Accordingly  I  accept
      that the first and second Razgar questions are to be answered  in  the
      Appellants' favour.


  22. There is no issue between the parties in  respect  of  the  third  and
      fourth Razgar questions.


  23.  In  respect  of  the  fifth  Razgar  question,  proportionality,  the
      Appellants place reliance upon the approach in  MM.  For  the  reasons
      given above, I find that the High Court decision in MM does not  avail
      the Appellants. Moreover, nothing else is advanced on their  behalves,
      and I can identify no basis for concluding that there  were,  or  are,
      any compelling circumstances, such that an exception  should  be  made
      for the Appellants notwithstanding that they did not meet the  express
      requirements of the Rules at the date of the Respondent's decisions.


  24. In all such circumstances, and on the premise  that  the  Respondent's
      decisions constituted an interference in the mutual family life of the
      Appellants and the sponsor, I conclude that the Respondent's decisions
      were proportionate to the public  interest  in  maintaining  effective
      immigration control.


  25. Accordingly, the appeals are dismissed on human rights grounds.



  26. I am otherwise unable to identify any basis for  concluding  that  the
      Respondent's decisions were not in accordance with the law.


  27. For the avoidance of any doubt, I note that  I  have  determined  this
      appeal by reference to the  High  Court  decision  in  MM,  which  was
      applicable at the date of hearing, and reflects the  submissions  made
      by the parties. Of course, since then the High Court  decision  in  MM
      has been overturned by the Court of Appeal in such a  manner  as  runs
      contrary to the Appellants' reliance upon it. Whilst not material  for
      the purposes of this determination, necessarily the  decision  of  the
      Court of Appeal  undermines  the  Appellants'  attempt  to  rely  upon
      Article 8 by arguing that the  income  level  requirements  under  the
      Rules are disproportionate.


Decisions

  28. The decisions of the First-tier Tribunal Judge contained errors of law
      and are set aside. I remake the decisions in the appeals.


  29. Appeal OA/09358/2013 is dismissed.


  30. Appeal OA/09359/2013 is dismissed.


  31. Appeal OA/09356/2013 is dismissed.
