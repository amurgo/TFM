Representation:
For the Appellant:     The Appellant in Person
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of South Africa born  on  2  October  1981.
    On 18 July 2014 he applied for leave to remain in the UK on  the  basis
    of his family and private life in the United Kingdom.   The  respondent
    refused his application in a letter dated 13  November  2014.  In  that
    letter the respondent concluded that the Appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM section R-LTRPT of the  Immigration  Rules.
    The respondent concluded that he did not satisfy  the  requirements  of
    the Rules with regard to eligibility and further that  paragraph  EX.1.
    did not apply. In consequence the Respondent decided to refuse to  vary
    his leave to remain and remove him under section 47 of the Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

2.   The appellant appealed that decision to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes in a decision promulgated on  16  July
    2015 dismissed the appeal.

3.   The appellant sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and
    permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Martin  on  2  November
    2015 on the basis that it was arguable as asserted in the  grounds  for
    permission to appeal  that  the  First-tier  Judge  had  erred  in  his
    interpretation of paragraph E-ECPT.2.4.(a)(ii) and  (b)  as  there  was
    clear evidence before the judge that the appellant  was  having  direct
    contact with his son.

4.   The grounds for permission to appeal assert the following.  It is  said
    that the appellant met the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.   It
    is asserted that the First-tier Tribunal made a material error  of  law
    in that the  First-tier  Tribunal  misdirected  itself  and  applied  a
    section of the Rules which was  not  appropriate.   The  appellant  was
    required to demonstrate that he had access  rights  to  the  child  and
    provide evidence that he was taking and intending to continue  to  take
    an active role in the child's upbringing.

5.   It is said that at paragraph 12 of the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
    the Judge found that the appellant was taking an  active  role  in  his
    son's life and this may increase.  At paragraph 13 the Judge said  that
    the appellant could rely on access rights by agreement with  the  other
    parent, there was such an agreement, and  that  the  appellant  had  an
    intention to take part in his son's upbringing.

6.   It is submitted on this basis and given the findings of the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the appellant met the  eligibility  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules and it was not suggested or found that the  appellant
    did not meet any other requirement of Appendix FM under the parent of a
    British child category.  The First-tier Tribunal therefore erred in law
    and misdirected itself by suggesting that the  appellant  also  had  to
    satisfy  the  requirements  of  paragraph  EX.1.   There  was  no  such
    requirement and therefore the appeal should have been allowed.

7.   At the hearing Mr Kotas on behalf of the Secretary  of  State  referred
    me to his intention to withdraw the Rule 24 response as set out  in  an
    email to the Upper Tribunal on 11 January 2016.  In that he email  said
    that the Secretary of State no longer opposed the  appellant's  appeal.
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede  decided  that  the  appeal  should  remain
    listed.

8.   At the hearing the appellant attended without his  representatives  who
    had written to the Tribunal on 12 January  2016  stating  that  on  the
    basis of the Secretary of  State's  stance  and  in  the  interests  of
    expense they would not be  attending  the  hearing  on  their  client's
    instructions.  Mr Kotas agreed on behalf of the Secretary of State that
    there was a material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision
    and that the refusal letter  did  not  put  in  issue  the  appellant's
    ability to satisfy the remaining eligibility requirements of the Rules.
    On the basis of the evidence in the appellant's bundle he satisfied all
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules and consequently  the  appeal
    should be allowed outright.

9.   In those circumstances and in the light of all of the  evidence  before
    me I find that there was a material error of law in the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal for the following reasons.

10.  In order  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  section  R-LTRPT.1.1.  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  the  appellant  is  required  to
    demonstrate that he and the child are in the UK; he has  made  a  valid
    application for limited leave to remain as a partner; he does not  fall
    for refusal under "Suitability leave to remain" and that he  meets  all
    of the requirements of "Eligibility for leave to remain".  In terms  of
    the relationship requirements it is not in issue that  the  appellant's
    child is under the age of 18, is living in the  UK  and  is  a  British
    citizen.

11.  The requirements in issue in this appeal  related  to  the  appellant's
    ability  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  E-LTRPT.2.4  (relationship
    requirements).  It was the appellant's case that he had  access  rights
    to his child and that he had provided evidence that he was  taking  and
    intended to continue to take an active role in the  child's  upbringing
    and therefore satisfied the requirements of the section.

12.  I find that the First-tier Tribunal misdirected itself in  relation  to
    the appellant's ability to satisfy those requirements.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal found at paragraphs  12  and  13  of  the  decision  that  the
    appellant was now taking an active role in his son's life and that this
    would increase or may  increase.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  at
    paragraph 13 that the appellant intended to take some part in his son's
    upbringing albeit that  this  had  to  be  seen  against  his  previous
    actions.

13.  It was clear in any event  on  the  evidence  that  the  appellant  had
    direct contact with  his  son  and  that  he  had  been  involved  with
    Oxfordshire Family Mediation and there was a report before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal showing that there was an agreement for contact.

14.  In the circumstances and in view of the fact  that,  according  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal's findings, the appellant was involved in his son's
    upbringing, the Tribunal then  misdirected  itself  in  dismissing  the
    appeal.  The refusal letter did not put any  other  provisions  of  the
    Rules in issue.  The appellant was required to demonstrate in order  to
    satisfy  the  eligibility  requirements  that  in   addition   to   the
    relationship requirement the immigration status  requirement  was  met.
    The appellant had leave and so that was not in issue.

15.  In the circumstances I set the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    aside and re-make the decision. As stated, it is clear that the on  the
    basis of the findings of fact of the First-tier Tribunal the  Appellant
    met the requirements of E-LTRPT.2.4.  There  was  also  clear  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal that he met the  financial  requirements
    of E-LTRPT.4.1 in terms of maintenance and accommodation.  The evidence
    in relation to that was to be found at pages 143 to 144 of  his  bundle
    before the First-tier Tribunal  where  his  wage  slips  were  appended
    demonstrating that he had a net income of around ï¿½2,500 a month and his
    P60 and bank statements,  which  were  at  pages  127  to  141  of  the
    appellant's bundle.  In  those  circumstances  paragraph  EX.1  is  not
    engaged.

16.  Mr Kotas agreed that that evidence met the requirements  of  the  Rules
    and I am satisfied that he would have been  adequately  maintained  and
    accommodated in the UK.  He had also submitted evidence in relation  to
    the English language requirement.

17.  In those circumstances the appellant meets all of the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules and the appeal is allowed.  I therefore set aside
    the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  allow  the  appellant's
    appeal.

Notice of Decision

I find that there was an error of law in the decision of the  First-tier.  I
set that decision aside  and  re-make  it  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
Immigration Rules.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
