                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal, brought with  the
    permission of a Judge of the Upper Tribunal, against a decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Cox hereinafter "the judge") promulgated  on
    10th August 2015 dismissing her appeal against a refusal  by  an  Entry
    Clearance Officer of 21st November 2014 to issue to her entry clearance
    to come to the UK, with a view to settlement, as a spouse.

 2. By way of brief background, the Appellant is a national of Pakistan and
    she was born on 2nd January 1984.  She  is  married  to  her  UK  based
    Sponsor Mr Munir Ahmed, the relevant marriage  having  taken  place  in
    Pakistan.  There are no children of the union.  The Appellant  made  an
    initial application for entry clearance which was refused on  financial
    grounds.  Thereafter, she made a further application (the one which has
    led to this appeal) which was refused on 21st November 2014, again,  on
    financial grounds.  Essentially, the Entry Clearance Officer  took  the
    view that  the  Appellant  had  failed  to  provide  certain  items  of
    prescribed evidence, the relevant evidential requirements being set  at
    paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Entry
    Clearance Officer also  thought  that  the  accommodation  requirements
    within the Rules were  not  met.   However,  the  Appellant  sought  to
    dispute the decision and this  led  to  an  Entry  Clearance  Manager's
    review being undertaken on  5th  January  2015.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Manager accepted that documentation provided  since  the  date  of  the
    initial decision demonstrated that the accommodation requirements were,
    in fact, met.  However, no concession was  made  with  respect  to  the
    financial requirements and, indeed, the Entry Clearance  Manager  noted
    that whilst bank statements provided by the  Sponsor  demonstrated  his
    income for the 2013-2014 financial year to be �17,239.90, his  accounts
    and tax return had indicated that his business  income  for  that  same
    period (that is the gross amount made by the business) was �27,798.  So
    there was an apparent inconsistency in the figures.  Having  maintained
    the refusal under the  Rules  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  addressed
    Article 8 but decided that there were  "no  exceptional  circumstances"
    such that entry clearance could not be granted on  the  basis  of  that
    provision.  The Appellant then appealed.

 3. There was an oral hearing of the appeal on 23rd July 2015 at which both
    parties were represented.  The Appellant, of course, being out  of  the
    country, was unable to attend but the Sponsor was in attendance and  he
    gave oral evidence.

 4. It is apparent from the judge's determination that he found the Sponsor
    to be entirely credible.   He  also  accepted  that  documentation  now
    provided by the Sponsor demonstrated that he had a net profit  for  the
    relevant year, as a self-employed taxi driver, amounting to �19,643 and
    that all of the shortcomings in the documentary evidence noted  by  the
    Entry Clearance  Officer  had  now  been  addressed.   One  might  have
    expected, therefore, that the appeal would  have  succeeded.   However,
    the judge then turned to  the  additional  point  taken  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager regarding the difference in figures contained in  the
    bank statements and the accounts and tax return  regarding  his  income
    for the 2013/2014 tax year.  The judge noted, and indeed accepted,  the
    Sponsor's explanation, given in oral evidence, that he would  use  cash
    paid to him to cover  certain  business  expenses  such  as  purchasing
    petrol or having the taxi vehicle washed such that some of  his  income
    would not be paid into any bank account  at  all.   However,  said  the
    judge, the  fact  was  that  he  had  not  produced  a  bank  statement
    demonstrating that the �18,600 financial income threshold had been  met
    for the relevant  tax  year  and  had  not,  therefore,  satisfied  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules in that respect.  The  judge  put
    it this way;

         "22. At the hearing the Sponsor explained that he would use cash to
             cover expenses such as petrol or washing the car  and  I  note
             that this is reflected in the accountant's report.  Although I
             am satisfied that the Sponsor  has  adequately  explained  the
             shortfall in his gross income, I am also  satisfied  that  the
             Sponsor's cash deposits for the relevant year do not show  his
             gross income.

           23.    On the totality of the evidence, I find that the Appellant
             has failed to discharge the burden of proof.  I  am  satisfied
             that the Sponsor's gross income is not reflected in  his  bank
             statement.  I note that the Appellant's representative has not
             disputed that the cash bank  statements  do  not  reflect  his
             gross income.

           24.    Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the Appellant met the
             financial eligibility requirements  of  the  Rules  and  I  am
             satisfied that the Respondent's decision is in accordance with
             the Immigration Rules."

 5. The judge then turned to the arguments under Article 8 of the ECHR.  He
    referred to case law and, in particular, to the Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and Razgar v  Home
    Secretary [2004] UKHL 27.  He went through the fivefold test set out in
    Razgar and decided that Article 8 was engaged but that the interference
    with Article 8 rights was lawful, in pursuance of a legitimate aim  and
    proportionate.  As to proportionality he noted that in  SS  (Congo)  it
    had been said that  in  out  of  country  cases  a  greater  margin  of
    appreciation would be afforded to a  Respondent  and  that  "compelling
    circumstances" would be needed to justify a grant of  leave  to  remain
    outside of the Immigration Rules.  He thought that there were  no  such
    circumstances in this case, principally, because the Appellant would be
    able to make a fresh application for entry clearance.  So, he dismissed
    the appeal.

 6. That was not the end of the matter because an application was made,  by
    the   Appellant's   current   representatives   who   were   not    his
    representatives before the judge, for permission to appeal to the Upper
    Tribunal.  The written grounds are quite lengthy but, in summary, it is
    contended  that  the  judge  erred  in  failing  to  apply  "evidential
    flexibility"  principles  with  respect  to  the  position  under   the
    Immigration Rules and in  failing  to  carry  out  a  proper  balancing
    exercise with respect to Article 8.  The drafter of  the  grounds  drew
    attention to a document entitled "Immigration Directorate Instructions:
    Annex FM Section FM1.7: Financial Requirement Nov 2014.  He pointed out
    that paragraph 9.3.8 of that document says;

         "Self-employed income can be cash-in-hand if  the  correct  tax  is
         paid.  In line with paragraph 3.1.5  of  this  guidance,  it  would
         generally be expected that the person's business or  personal  bank
         statements would fully reflect all  gross  (pre-tax)  cash  income.
         Flexibility  may  only  be  applied  where  the  decision-maker  is
         satisfied that the cash income relied upon is  fully  evidenced  by
         the relevant tax return(s) and the accounts information."

 7. It was his argument, in effect, that those words amounted to  a  policy
    with respect to flexibility in the context of cash businesses which the
    judge should have taken into account when dealing with the appeal under
    the Rules and  which  was  also  a  relevant  factor  with  respect  to
    proportionality under Article 8.

 8. Permission was granted by a Judge of the Upper Tribunal who said this;

         "2.  Although it is  not  clear  whether  the  judge  was  in  fact
             referred to the policy guidance cited in the  renewed  Grounds
             of Appeal it is at least arguable, in  light  of  the  judge's
             finding that the Appellant had addressed the  concerns  raised
             by the ECO [20], that  he  should  perhaps  have  gone  on  to
             consider evidential  flexibility  (at  least  in  relation  to
             Appendix FM-SE(D)(d).

           3. Permission to appeal is granted."

 9. There was then a hearing before  the  Upper  Tribunal  (before  me)  to
    explore, initially, whether or not the judge had erred in law and then,
    if so, what should follow from that.  Representation  at  that  hearing
    was as indicated above.

10. Mr Sharif, for the Appellant, essentially, stood by  his  grounds.   He
    pointed out that the actual business income received, which  of  course
    was more than that shown in the bank statement as having been received,
    was apparent from other documents such as the  Sponsor's  relevant  tax
    return.  The judge had accepted  that  all  of  the  matters  initially
    placed  in  dispute  by  the   Entry   Clearance   Officer   had   been
    satisfactorily dealt with.  Although the Grounds of Appeal to the First-
    tier  Tribunal  had  not   raised   arguments   concerning   evidential
    flexibility, evidential flexibility is referred to in  the  Rules  and,
    therefore, the judge should have considered the point for himself.   As
    to Article 8, the policy regarding evidential flexibility was  material
    and should have been considered by the judge in his balancing exercise.
     Mr Diwnycz, for the Respondent, observed that "Rules are  Rules"  and,
    in this case, submitted that the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
    had not been met.  It was not apparent that  a  point  had  been  taken
    before the judge regarding evidential flexibility.  Article 8 had  been
    dealt with adequately.

11. I reserved my decision.  Having reflected on  matters  I  have  decided
    that the judge did not make an error of law and  that,  therefore,  his
    decision should stand.  I set out my reasoning, as to this, below.

12. It is right to say that the judge did resolve a considerable number  of
    matters in favour of the Appellant and the Sponsor.  However, as noted,
    he concluded that the requirements of the Rules were  not  met  because
    the  bank  statement  did  not  demonstrate  that  the  minimum  income
    threshold had been met.   It  does  not  appear  that  the  Appellant's
    representative at the hearing before the judge had contended otherwise.
     Indeed, at paragraph 23 of his determination the judge noted  that  it
    was not disputed "that the bank statements do  not  reflect  his  gross
    income".  So, if the appeal were to succeed under the Rules that  could
    only be on the basis that some form of evidential flexibility could  be
    applied.

13. When granting permission to appeal the granting judge made reference to
    Appendix FM-SE(D)(d).  The relevant part reads as follows;

    A.   This Appendix sets out the specified evidence applicants  need  to
         provide to meet the requirements of the Rules contained in Appendix
         FM and where those requirements are also contained in other  Rules,
         including Appendix Armed Forces, and unless otherwise  stated,  the
         specified  evidence  applicants  need  to  provide  to   meet   the
         requirements of those Rules ...

    D.   ...

         (d)  If the applicant has submitted:

             (i)  a document in the wrong format;

             (ii) a document that is a copy and not an  original  document,
                  or

             (iii)    a document that does not contain all of the specified
                  information, but the  missing  information  is  verifiable
                  from:

                  (1)  other documents submitted with the application,

                  (2)  the website of  the  organisation  which  issued  the
                      document, or

                  (3)  the website of the appropriate regulatory body,

                  The application may be granted  exceptionally,  providing
                  the decision maker is satisfied that  the  document(s)  is
                  genuine and that the applicant meets  the  requirement  to
                  which the document relates ...

14.  There  is,  also,  the  paragraph  from  the  Immigration  Directorate
    Instructions, referred to  above,  which  also  deals  with  evidential
    flexibility.

15. There is nothing  to  suggest,  as  Mr  Sharif  effectively  and  quite
    properly conceded before me, that any argument  based  upon  evidential
    flexibility or specifically upon the paragraph of the Immigration Rules
    set out above or the Immigration Directorate Instructions  was  put  at
    any point during the course of the appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    The  Grounds  of  Appeal  to  that  body  do  not  mention   evidential
    flexibility and it does not appear,  from  a  careful  reading  of  the
    determination, that any such argument was made to the judge.   I  have,
    in fairness to the Appellant and Sponsor,  checked  the  judge's  typed
    Record of Proceedings but that does not contain any indication  of  any
    such argument ever having been made during the course of  the  hearing.
    That, then, is consistent with the absence of a reference  to  such  an
    argument in the judge's determination.  I have to conclude,  therefore,
    that no such argument was ever raised with the First-tier  Tribunal  at
    any stage.

16. I appreciate  that  paragraph  3.3.8  of  the  Immigration  Directorate
    Instructions  does  refer  to  the  possibility  of  flexibility  being
    applied, in the context of a cash business, where the decision maker is
    satisfied that the cash income relied upon is fully evidenced by a  tax
    return and accounts information.  It is right to  say  that  the  judge
    accepted that the cash income relied upon had been  properly  evidenced
    in that regard.  One criticism of the judge advanced on behalf  of  the
    Appellant, then, is that he did not apply the policy  contained  within
    the  relevant  part  of  the  Immigration   Directorate   Instructions.
    However, it must be the case that, in the context of  an  appeal  where
    there is competent legal representation, for  such  representatives  to
    raise any arguments based  on  policy  matters  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and evidence the existence of such a  policy.   Quite  simply,
    here, that was not done.  Against that  background  I  cannot  conclude
    that the judge erred in failing to deal with  an  argument  based  upon
    policy which had not been put to him.  Had the point been raised before
    him and  had  he  then  disregarded  it  that  would  have  been  quite
    different.  That, however, was not the situation.

17. There is then the matter of Appendix FM-SE(D)(d).  Again,  no  argument
    based upon this provision was ever put to the judge.  Mr Sharif, during
    discussions about this at the hearing, contended  that,  in  effect,  a
    judge should be aware of all potentially relevant Immigration Rules and
    should apply such Rules even if an argument about an aspect of  such  a
    Rule is not put by competent representatives.  I  have  hesitated  over
    this but it does seem to me that there is a  distinction  to  be  drawn
    between an Immigration Rule containing a substantive requirement and  a
    provision such as this which is of a  discretionary  nature  and  which
    will  not  often  be  relevant.  In  my  judgment,  where  a  party  is
    competently represented, as was the Appellant before the judge, it must
    be for the representative to raise the point.  Quite simply,  that  was
    not done.  Again, therefore, I cannot fault the judge for a failure  to
    deal with  an  argument  about  a  provision  within  the  Rules  of  a
    discretionary nature which was not put to him at all.

18. It follows, from the above, that I conclude the judge did not err  with
    respect to his consideration of the appeal under the Immigration Rules.
     I now turn to his Article 8 consideration.

19. Here, the judge did conscientiously go through the five stages set  out
    in the judgment in Razgar.  Although it would mean her having to make a
    third go, it was certainly open to  the  judge  to  attach  significant
    weight, as he did, to the  availability  of  a  fresh  entry  clearance
    application.  His consideration of the competing Article 8 factors was,
    very clearly, balanced. It was certainly an adequate consideration.

20. Mr Sharif makes the particular point that the judge did not  factor  in
    the existence of the "policy" regarding Article 8 and  that  he  should
    have done so when considering proportionality.  However, it seems to me
    that that argument, too, fails on the basis that the policy, if that is
    what it is, was never put to the judge at all.  In any event, I can see
    no basis for thinking that that would have made a difference given  the
    requirement, as identified by the judge, for compelling  circumstances.



21. I must say I do have some sympathy for the Appellant and the Sponsor in
    this case.  The consequence of the decision  made  by  the  judge  and,
    indeed, my decision is that they must now contemplate  making  a  third
    application in circumstances  where  it  does  appear  the  substantive
    requirements have been satisfied. I must, however, apply  the  law  and
    not be swayed by that sympathy.  For the reasons set out above I cannot
    conclude that the judge erred in law and I  must  conclude,  therefore,
    that his decision should stand.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law.  That decision shall stand.
