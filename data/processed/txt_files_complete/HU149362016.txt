Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Fijiwala, Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr I Khan of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will  refer  to  the
    original appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh born on 24  December  1989,
    as the appellant herein.  He arrived in this country in 2009 on a  Tier
    4 Student visa.  He made an application on 19 February 2016  for  leave
    to  remain  on  the  basis  of  his  family  and  private  life.   That
    application was refused on 23 May 2016 as  it  was  said  that  he  had
    failed to meet the requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules
    because he had obtained an English  language  certificate  following  a
    test on 20  March  2012  by  fraud.   The  test  certificate  had  been
    cancelled by Educational Testing Service (ETS).

2.   The appellant appealed against the decision and his  appeal  was  heard
    by a First-tier Judge on 9 March 2017.

3.   At that  hearing  the  appellant  and  his  wife  gave  evidence.   The
    appellant did not use an interpreter.

4.   While it was accepted by the Secretary of State that the appellant  met
    the other eligibility requirements as a partner under Appendix  FM  the
    application had been refused on suitability grounds and there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances  to  grant  the  appellant  leave  to  remain
    outside the Immigration Rules.

5.   The judge acknowledged that  the  appellant's  rights  of  appeal  were
    restricted and she could not consider as a freestanding ground  whether
    the appellant met the provisions of the Rules.  She could only consider
    whether the Secretary of  State's  decision  breached  the  appellant's
    human rights.  The evidence before the First-tier Judge was  summarised
    as follows:

         "6.  The Respondent seeks to rely  on  the  witness  statements  of
             Rebecca  Collings,  Peter  Millington  and  Mary  Morgan,   in
             addition to a spreadsheet of invalid test results.   The  Home
             Office report into West Link  College  confirms  that  between
             18th October 2011  and  18th  April  2012  West  Link  College
             undertook 915 English  language  tests  of  which  Educational
             Testing Services (ETS) identified that 72% were in valid.  ETS
             used voice recognition software to identify  that  the  person
             taking the test had taken multiple tests on behalf of numerous
             candidates.


         7.   Mary Morgan in her witness statement dated 27th February  2017
             confirmed that she  was  a  senior  caseworker  and  that  her
             statement was to assist the Tribunal to understand the process
             by  which  the  Appellant  was  identified  as  a  person  who
             fraudulently obtained an  English  language  test  certificate
             provided by ETS.  She confirms that the test result  had  been
             cancelled by ETS on the basis of its own analysis and that the
             Home Office were notified by way of an entry on a spreadsheet.
              She highlights those paragraphs of the witness statements  of
             Rebecca Collings and  Peter  Millington  that  deal  with  the
             process of identifying individual fraudulent results.


         8.   I have also  been  provided  with  a  witness  statement  from
             Professor  Peter  French  dated  20th  April  2016  where   he
             recognises that voice recognition software can lead to  errors
             in reporting invalid tests.   He  was  unable  to  assess  the
             likely number of errors but recognised that  the  pilot  tests
             themselves identified an error rate of approximately  2%.   He
             estimated that the number of false  positives  would  be  very
             substantially less than 1%  because  of  the  quality  of  the
             listeners and the speech available to them for analysis".


6.   The appellant referred to evidence of his English  language  ability  -
    he  had  obtained  a  certificate  from  the  Chartered  Institute   of
    Management Accountants in 2013 and had taken an English  language  test
    in March 2014 obtaining an overall band score  of  6.5.   He  had  also
    completed a Master of Arts qualification from Anglia Ruskin  University
    in July 2014.  The judge also had the benefit of a document prepared by
    Professor Peter Sommer in  which  he  had  raised  concerns  about  the
    processes that led to the conclusion that there had been fraud.

7.   The determination concludes as follows:

         "15. The experts cannot  agree  upon  the  accuracy  of  the  voice
             recognition process and  the  probability  of  false  positive
             reports.  Professor French indicates that the  risk  of  false
             results is very slim.  Dr Harrison gave evidence to the  Upper
             Tribunal, but not at this  appeal  hearing,  and  Prof  Sommer
             expressed grave concerns at  the  procedures  for  identifying
             dishonesty.  I have to conclude that there is a risk of  false
             fraud reporting although I am unable to determine the scale of
             likely errors.  I take notice  however  that  criticisms  have
             been made of the procedures that ETS applied.


         16.  The Appellant was cross-examined during  the  appeal  hearing.
             He was specifically asked about what action he had taken  upon
             becoming aware that the Respondent alleged fraud.  He said  he
             had not taken any action to discuss the results with ETS.  The
             Appellant had only become aware of the allegation of fraud  in
             2016 when his immigration application was  refused.   At  that
             time the Respondent did not seek to interview  the  Appellant.
             Whilst the Appellant was no doubt shocked  to  find  that  his
             test results had been  cancelled,  I  am  unable  to  find  an
             adverse credibility finding because he  did  not  contact  ETS
             directly.


         17.  At the time the  Appellant  took  his  Master's  degree,  CIMA
             certificate and subsequent English language test, he  was  not
             aware that his 2012 test would be declared invalid.   On  that
             basis, I am unable to conclude  that  those  assessments  were
             undertaken to bolster his claim that he had proficiency in the
             English language.  At that stage, his test was still valid.


         18.  The Appellant allowed himself to be cross-examined  about  the
             circumstances of the English  language  test,  notwithstanding
             that the test was taken almost 5 years ago.  He  was  able  to
             recall  the  components  of  the  test  and  gave  approximate
             timescales for how long they took to complete.   His  evidence
             was not challenged on this point.


         19.  Considering all the evidence in the round, I am not  satisfied
             on the  balance,  that  the  Appellant  procured  his  English
             language certificate by fraud.  I have noted the risk of error
             in  the  procedures  and  the  Appellant  has  given  credible
             evidence about the test that he took and  additional  evidence
             about  his  proficiency  in  English.   Taking  those   issues
             together, I cannot be satisfied that it is more probable  than
             not  that  the  Appellant  obtained   his   English   language
             certificate by deception.  Accordingly, he did not  fall  foul
             of the suitability requirements and therefore was eligible for
             leave to remain under the partner route of Appendix  FM.   The
             Appellant's appeal could  not  succeed  on  that  point  alone
             because  his  grounds  of  appeal  are   restricted   by   the
             Immigration Act 2014.  However, noting  that  I  have  decided
             that the decision of the Respondent was not in accordance with
             the Immigration Rules, that factor will weigh heavily  on  the
             balance  when  I   consider   the   proportionality   of   the
             Respondent's decision.


         20.  The Respondent has not disputed that the Appellant was married
             or that he had a young child.  His wife was a British  citizen
             and all her family live  in  the  UK.   The  decision  of  the
             Respondent impacts upon the Appellant's ability to  enjoy  his
             family life with his partner and child, and therefore  engages
             article 8 of the European Convention on  Human  Rights.   Such
             rights are not absolute, they may be interfered  with  by  the
             authorities where  necessary  and  proportional.   I  have  to
             consider whether the decision strikes a fair  balance  between
             the Appellant's rights and the public interest.


         21.  The child is young and dependant on his parents.  It is in the
             child's best interests to have a beneficial relationship  with
             both parents.


         22.  I remind myself that it is in the public interest to  maintain
             firm immigration control.  This  Appellant  appears  to  speak
             English  well  but  does  not   appear   to   be   financially
             independent.  The Appellant talks about his  ability  to  work
             albeit he appears to be dependent on his  wife.   He  met  his
             wife in 2013 and married her at a time when he  believed  that
             his immigration status was lawful.  He  became  aware  of  the
             refusal decision in May 2016.


         23.  Having concluded that the Respondent was unable to satisfy  me
             that the Appellant procured his English  language  certificate
             by fraud, and therefore unfairly refused his application under
             Appendix FM, I am bound to also conclude that the decision  of
             the Respondent is not proportional in all  the  circumstances.
             It does not strike a fair balance because  the  Appellant  did
             meet the Immigration Rules.  The competing public interest  to
             remove him  is  not  strong.   On  that  basis,  I  allow  the
             Appellant's appeal under article 8 of the European  Convention
             on Human Rights".


8.   The Secretary of State applied for permission to  appeal  referring  to
    SM and Qadir (ETS - evidence - burden of proof) [2016]  UKUT  229.   It
    was submitted that sufficient evidence that the appellant had  employed
    deception had been provided.  It was clear in the light of Secretary of
    State v Shehzad [2016] EWCA Civ 615 that the evidence  would  discharge
    the evidential burden on  the  Secretary  of  State  and  it  was  then
    incumbent on the appellant to provide evidence in response  raising  an
    innocent explanation.

9.   It  was  argued  that  the  First-tier  Judge  had  misinterpreted  the
    evidence.  Reference was made to the evidential burden of proof.  If an
    innocent explanation had been raised the burden would shift back to the
    Secretary of State in order  to  address  the  legal  burden.   It  was
    submitted that the judge had failed to give adequate reasoning why  the
    Secretary of State had not met the legal burden and had similarly erred
    on the issue of innocent explanation.  The judge had erred  in  failing
    to give adequate reasons for holding that a person  who  clearly  spoke
    English would have no reason to secure a test certificate by deception.



10.  The Secretary of State had met the evidential burden and it  was  clear
    from the determination that the First-tier Judge  had  not  appreciated
    that the evidential burden had been met.  While not infallible, the ETS
    verification system was adequately robust and rigorous.

11.  In relation to Article 8 the findings had been coloured  by  the  issue
    of deception.  More had to be shown that relocation abroad would  cause
    difficulty or hardship and there was no finding that family life  could
    not continue in Bangladesh.  There was nothing to prevent the appellant
    returning to Bangladesh  in  order  to  apply  for  the  correct  entry
    clearance.  Any separation would be temporary and proportionate in  the
    interests of an effective immigration control.

12.  Permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  26
    September 2017.

13.  Ms Fijiwala referred to Ahsan v Secretary  of  State  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
    2009 and the summary of the jurisprudence  in  paragraphs  26       ff.
    The generic evidence was sufficient to transfer the  evidential  burden
    whereupon it was necessary for the appellant  to  provide  an  innocent
    explanation.  In paragraph  27  there  was  reference  to  Shehzad  and
    Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615 where the appeal in Mr  Chowdhury's  case
    had been allowed  because  the  Tribunal  had  wrongly  held  that  the
    Secretary of State's evidence did not establish  a  prima  facie  case.
    The appeal was remitted  for  a  hearing  to  consider  Mr  Chowdhury's
    evidence in answer.

14.  In paragraph 31 there was reference to a case where the  impugned  test
    had been taken at Elizabeth College and  the  Secretary  of  State  had
    relied in particular on the Project Fa�ade report and  on  Mr  Sewell's
    report.  It had been common ground that the evidence raised a  case  to
    answer and the Upper Tribunal Judge had found that the applicant's oral
    evidence  which  had   been   "riddled   with   implausibilities"   was
    insufficient to shift the burden on him.

15.  The First-tier Judge in the instant appeal  had  had  similar  material
    and the look-up tool and the Project Fa�ade report.  The judge had  not
    made a finding that the  evidential  burden  had  been  discharged  and
    seemed to have skipped to the third stage  without  going  through  the
    first two steps.  Matters would have been different if  the  judge  had
    analysed the evidence correctly.

16.  In relation to Article  8  the  issue  of  deception  was  relevant  in
    relation to Appendix FM and outside the Rules.  Appendix EX.1. had  not
    been referred to.  There had been no proper balancing exercise  outside
    the Rules.

17.  I heard from Mr Khan that the appellant and his  wife  had  had  a  son
    since the Secretary of State's decision who was some 11 months old.  At
    the time of the decision reference had been  made  to  the  appellant's
    partner's brother who had a special needs child.  He submitted that  it
    had been open to the judge to decide the case as  she  had  done.   The
    judge had set out all the evidence relied upon by  the  respondent.   A
    proportion of the test results had been  valid.   The  judge  had  gone
    through the  evidence  before  her  properly  and  had  considered  the
    appellant's oral evidence and  the  witness  statements.   An  innocent
    explanation had been provided which had shifted the burden back to  the
    Secretary of State.  She had referred  to  Professor  Sommer's  report.
    The Secretary of  State's  evidence  had  been  unreliable.   When  the
    determination was read as a whole, Counsel submitted that the judge had
    gone through the three stage test.  The judge had not erred  in  taking
    into account the appellant's  English  language  ability  -  one  could
    contrast the case mentioned at paragraph 31 of Ahsan where the evidence
    had been riddled with implausibilities.

18.  In relation to Article 8 Counsel acknowledged that Appendix  EX.1.  had
    not been mentioned but the error was not material.  There was a  policy
    that applied in relation to British children.

19.  In reply Ms Fijiwala submitted that the judge had erred in  failing  to
    assess the evidence going to the evidential burden.  In relation to the
    Article 8 issues she referred to Agyarko v Secretary  of  State  [2017]
    UKSC 11.  The case had to be considered under the Rules; if  the  Rules
    were met the Article 8 case would succeed.  The  Rules  were  relevant.
    The judge had not considered EX.1. or Section 117B(6).   The  issue  of
    reasonableness had not been addressed.

20.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Judge if it was materially flawed in law.

21.  The process of deciding cases such as  this  is  not  simple.   However
    unless the processes are adhered to with some care there is a  risk  of
    misdirection.  The judge in this case does  not  appear  to  have  gone
    through the proper three stage process as is submitted by Ms  Fijiwala.
    Counsel argues that the judge went carefully through the  material  but
    having given the determination as sympathetic a reading as I can  I  do
    not find that the Secretary of State's central complaint is  addressed.



22.  The judge reached her conclusion in relation to Article 8 in the  light
    of his assessment of the evidence in relation to the  English  language
    test.  It is, moreover, accepted by Counsel that the judge did not deal
    with the Article 8 issues satisfactorily.  There was  no  reference  to
    paragraph EX.1.  The  Article  8  issues  were  reached  following  the
    judge's analysis of the fraud issue which I have found to be in error.

23.  At the hearing Counsel acknowledged that an  updating  bundle  had  not
    been lodged since the decision of the First-tier Judge.

24.  In the circumstances and having regard to the need for  the  degree  of
    fact-finding required, I am satisfied that it is  appropriate  in  this
    case for the appeal to  be  remitted  for  a  fresh  hearing  before  a
    different First-tier Judge.

25.  The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated.

Anonymity Order

26.  The First-tier Judge made no anonymity order and I make none.


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The First-tier Judge made no fee award and at this  stage  a  fee  award  is
inappropriate.
