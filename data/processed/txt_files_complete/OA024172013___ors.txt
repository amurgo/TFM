                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellants appeal against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Balloch promulgated on 13th February 2014.

 2. The Appellants are nationals of Pakistan born 1st  January  1973,  23rd
    July 1995, 29th October 1998, and 28th June 1997.  The first  Appellant
    is the mother of the second, third and fourth Appellants.

 3. The Appellants applied for entry clearance to enable them to settle  in
    the United Kingdom with the  Sponsor  MW,  the  husband  of  the  first
    Appellant, and the father of the second, third and  fourth  Appellants.
    The Sponsor had indefinite leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  when
    the applications were made, and became a British citizen in May 2013.

 4. The applications were refused on 29th November 2012  as  the  financial
    requirements set out in Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules  were  not
    satisfied.  The Respondent contended that it had not been  proved  that
    the Sponsor had a gross annual income of at least �27,200,  as  it  was
    claimed that he had a gross salary of �27,000 per annum, and  specified
    documents which were required to prove satisfaction  of  the  financial
    requirements, had not been submitted with the applications.

 5. The Appellants appealed and their appeals were heard together by  Judge
    Balloch (the judge) on 30th January 2014.  The  judge  found  that  the
    specified  documentation  required  by  Appendix  FM-SE  had  not  been
    submitted, and it had not been proved that the Sponsor had gross annual
    income of at least �27,200.  The appeals were therefore dismissed under
    the Immigration Rules.

 6. The judge also considered Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention  on
    Human Rights, on the basis of the Sponsor's  private  life,  and  found
    that the Respondent's decisions did not breach Article 8.  The  appeals
    were therefore dismissed on human rights grounds.

 7. The Appellants applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.
    In brief summary it was contended that the judge had erred  in  law  by
    failing to consider the de minimis principle  on  the  basis  that  the
    minimum income  requirement  was  �27,200,  and  the  Sponsor's  income
    without his bonus was �27,000 being a shortfall of �200.  The Sponsor's
    income was therefore 99.26% of the requisite amount.

 8. It was also contended that the judge had erred in failing  to  consider
    material matters in relation to Article 8, and had not  considered  the
    best interests of the minor Appellants.   It  was  contended  that  the
    judge should have followed the approach set out by Blake J at paragraph
    102 of R (on the application of MM) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin).

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Mailer in the following terms;

         "1.  The appellants are the  mother  and  three  children  who  are
             nationals of Pakistan.  Their appeals against the decision  of
             the  respondent  refusing  their  applications  for  an  entry
             clearance under Appendix FM of the Rules were dismissed by FTT
             Judge Balloch in a determination promulgated on 13th  February
             2014.
         2.    The  judge  dismissed  their  appeals  under  the   financial
             requirements of the Rules and pursuant to  Article  8  of  the
             Human Rights Convention.  The sponsor's gross income was  �200
             short  of  the  required  minimum  level  of  earnings.    The
             interference was found to be proportionate.
         3.   The grounds assert that there was a  near  miss  which  should
             have been considered as being de minimis.  Further, the  judge
             did not follow the decision in     MM [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin)
             in the Article 8 assessment.
         4.   Whilst it is not obvious whether the  amount  of  �200  is  de
             minimis, it is arguable that the failure to have regard to and
             apply the approach identified in MM amounts  to  an  error  of
             law.
         5.   Permission is granted on both grounds."

10. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending in summary that the judge had not erred in law.  It was
    contended that the  judge  was  correct  to  find  that  post  decision
    evidence relating to a bonus could not be taken into account,  and  not
    considering MM was not an error.  The Respondent sought  to  rely  upon
    Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC).  It was contended that the Immigration
    Rules could not be met, and there were no compelling circumstances that
    would give rise to an unjustifiably harsh outcome by refusing leave  to
    the Appellants.

11. The Tribunal issued directions making  provision  for  there  to  be  a
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal  to  decide  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal determination should be set aside.

The Appellants' Submissions

12. Mr Vokes relied upon his skeleton argument.   In  relation  to  the  de
    minimis principle, the sponsor had given evidence that he would receive
    some bonus even if monthly targets were not met but the judge  made  no
    finding on this evidence and it was therefore open to  question  as  to
    whether the sponsor's earnings were in fact below �27,200, but even  if
    they were a sum of �200 was less than one percent of the sum  required.



13. Mr Vokes pointed out  that  the  judge  had  not  considered  MM  which
    indicated that the figure of �13,400 was a more appropriate figure than
    the figure of �18,600.  I was referred to paragraphs 43 - 45  of  Nasim
    and Others [2013] UKUT 610 (IAC) which gave guidance on the de  minimis
    principle, and confirmed that  it  was  distinct  from  the  near  miss
    principle.

14. In relation to Article 8 the judge had failed to take into account  the
    best interests of the three minor children.  Mr  Vokes  also  made  the
    point that there were four separate appeals taken together, and that it
    would seem on  the  figures  provided,  that  three  out  of  the  four
    Appellants should have succeeded.  If the Appellants had  had  separate
    appeals, three  out  of  four  would  have  succeeded  based  upon  the
    Sponsor's earnings.  This should have been considered by the Judge.  If
    Gulshan was to be applied, Mr Vokes submitted that there were  arguably
    good grounds for granting leave outside the rules and referred to Quila
    v SSHD [2011] UKSC 45, which gives guidance  on  family  reunion.   The
    question was whether the state could justify the exclusion of a  spouse
    as necessary and proportionate in pursuit of a legitimate aim.

15. I was asked to conclude that the Appellants' representative before  the
    First-tier Tribunal was wrong to present the  Article  8  case  to  the
    judge on the basis that only  the  Sponsor's  private  life  should  be
    considered.

The Respondent's Submissions

16. Mr Smart relied upon the rule 24 response  and  pointed  out  that  the
    refusal under the Immigration Rules was not based simply on a shortfall
    of �200, but was based upon the fact that specified documents  had  not
    been submitted.  Those documents  were  mandatory,  and  a  failure  to
    submit them with the  application  meant  that  the  appeal  could  not
    succeed under  the  rules.   Therefore  the  judge  had  not  erred  in
    dismissing the appeals under the rules.

17. In relation to MM Mr Smart noted that the Sponsor  was  not  a  British
    citizen at the date of refusal, which was 29th November  2012,  and  in
    any event this case had not been argued before the judge.

18. In relation to Mr Vokes' point that three out of four Appellants should
    have succeeded based upon the Sponsor's earnings, Mr  Smart  questioned
    which three should have been successful, as the applications for  entry
    clearance were made jointly, the  Appellants  are  a  family,  and  the
    appeals were heard jointly and together.

19. Mr Smart submitted that the judge had properly considered Article 8 and
    that the determination should stand.

The Appellants' Response

20. Mr Vokes contended that the judge should have considered that three out
    of  four  Appellants  could  have   succeeded   under   the   financial
    requirements, based upon the Sponsor's income.  In relation to  Article
    8 MM was a leading authority, and should have been considered, and  the
    fact that the  Sponsor  was  found  to  fall  short  of  the  financial
    requirements by only  �200  should  have  featured  in  the  Article  8
    consideration.

21. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

22. I reject the submission that the judge erred by not considering the  de
    minimis principle.  This is not a case where that principle could  have
    assisted the Appellants.

23. The appeals were not dismissed solely on the basis that  the  financial
    requirements were not met because  the  sponsor's  annual  income  fell
    short by only �200.  The applications were refused because it  had  not
    been proved that the Sponsor's annual income was sufficient to meet the
    financial  requirements,  but  also  because  the  specified  documents
    required by Appendix FM-SE had not been submitted with the application.
     The Respondent in refusing the applications stated;

         "These documents are specified in Immigration Rules in Appendix FM-
         SE and must be  provided.   You  have  not  submitted  all  of  the
         required documentation to demonstrate your Sponsor's income  is  as
         claimed."

24.  The judge set this out in paragraphs 8 and 15  of  the  determination.
    The judge considered the documents that should have been submitted, and
    those that were submitted in paragraphs  16  -  23,  and  concluded  in
    paragraph 24;

         "24. It is therefore the case that all the relevant information and
             documentation  to  demonstrate  that  the  required  level  of
             earnings could be met was not provided at  the  relevant  time
             and was not before the decision maker."

    It has not been contended that either the Respondent or the  judge  was
    wrong to find that the specified documents had not been submitted.

25. I also reject the submission that the judge should  have  decided  that
    three out of four Appellants could succeed  based  upon  the  financial
    requirements  being  satisfied.   This   is   because   the   financial
    requirements were not satisfied as the specified documentation had  not
    been submitted.  Therefore it is not the case that three out of four of
    the Appellants could have succeeded  if  their  cases  had  been  heard
    separately on appeal.  The judge did not err in law in  dismissing  the
    appeals under the Immigration Rules.

26. Article 8 was not raised as a Ground of Appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, nor was it raised in the skeleton argument placed before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

27. The Appellants were legally represented and the Grounds of  Appeal  and
    skeleton argument were prepared by their legal representative.

28. Nevertheless, the judge  permitted  Article  8  to  be  argued  at  the
    hearing, and considered  Article  8  in  paragraphs  28  -  33  of  the
    determination.  The Appellants'  representative  specifically  conceded
    that Article 8 was not relied upon in relation to family life, but  was
    only relied upon in relation to  the  Sponsor's  private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom.

29. Reference has been made to MM, which was considered in Gulshan, when it
    was found that the maintenance requirements of Appendix FM stand.   The
    Upper Tribunal In Gulshan recorded at paragraph 24(b);


         "24(b)   after applying the requirements  of  the  rules,  only  if
                there may arguably be good grounds  for  granting  leave  to
                remain outside them is it necessary for Article  8  purposes
                to  go  on  to  consider  whether   there   are   compelling
                circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them: R  (on
                the application of) Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);"

30. There was no material error in the judge not making a reference to  MM.
    The judge was entitled to take into account that  the  appellants  were
    legally represented, and entitled to accept a concession made  by  that
    legal representative, that family life was not relied upon.  If  family
    life was to be relied upon, the judge would have needed to consider the
    principles in Gulshan,  and  to  have  considered  whether  there  were
    arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  the  rules,
    and if it was decided that there were, the  judge  would  have  had  to
    consider the best interests of the children as a primary consideration,
    even though the children are not in the  United  Kingdom.   Those  best
    interests could of course be outweighed by other considerations.

31. However in this case, as it was specifically conceded that family  life
    was not relied upon,  and  the  judge  had  found  that  the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules were  not  satisfied,  the  judge
    committed no material error of law in only  considering  the  Sponsor's
    private life, and in finding that  the  Appellants  could  not  succeed
    under Article 8, and did not materially err in so finding.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not  disclose  a  material
error of law.

I do not set aside the decision.  The appeals are dismissed.

Anonymity

No order for anonymity was made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   However  as
three of the appellants are minors I consider  it  appropriate  to  make  an
anonymity order.  The appellants  are  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
proceedings unless and until directed  otherwise  and  no  report  of  these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify them  or  any  members  of
their family.  Failure to comply with this order could lead to  contempt  of
court.

The anonymity order is made pursuant to rule 14 of  The  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
