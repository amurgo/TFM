                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



    1. The appellant is a citizen of Colombia. He arrived in the  UK  as  a
       child  in  1987  to  join  his  mother  but  his  status  was  never
       regularised at this time. Later he applied to remain as a spouse and
       on the basis of long residence although he was never  granted  leave
       on either basis.

    2. In April 2005 the appellant was convicted  of  fraudulently  evading
       the prohibition on importation of a class A drug and  was  sentenced
       to 13 years imprisonment. In March 2006 the appellant  was  notified
       of his liability to deportation. In  September  2009  the  appellant
       claimed asylum. In 2010 he was released from prison on licence,  and
       has remained  in  the  community  ever  since  without  any  further
       criminal convictions.

    3. In March 2010  the  appellant  was  notified  of  his  liability  to
       automatic deportation under the UK Borders Act 2007. On 4th February
       2013 the respondent made a  decision  to  proceed  with  deportation
       under s. 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 and signed  a  deportation
       order against him. His appeal against the decision was dismissed  on
       all grounds by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cockrill in a determination
       promulgated on the 19th May 2015. In a decision  of  Upper  Tribunal
       Judge Chalkley dated 15th July 2016 it was found that the First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law and the matter was remitted to be heard de
       novo by the First-tier  Tribunal.  The  appeal  was  then  heard  by
       Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Campbell, who  dismissed
       the appeal in a decision promulgated on 10th February 2017.

    4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes
       on 1st June 2017 on the basis that it was arguable that  the  First-
       tier judge had erred in law in assessing the Article 3 ECHR risk  to
       the appellant on return to Colombia as there had been  a  breach  of
       confidentiality in the UK when the police sent the  appellant's  ex-
       wife's former partner a witness statement which disclosed he was  an
       informer and given that he had suffered threats in prison in the  UK
       which had led to him being segregated.

    5. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    6. The appellant argues firstly that the  First-  tier  Tribunal  erred
       because Detective Constable W, the police constable who  dealt  with
       the appellant's criminal case, sent a statement about his role as an
       informer regarding sophisticated Colombian drugs gangs involved with
       substantial amounts of money to his second partner's (Ms O's) former
       partner (Mr C) who was in a relationship with a  Colombian  national
       and asked for comments on the facts made within the  statement.  The
       appellant believes that given the animosity between the appellant  /
       Ms  O  and  this  ex-partner  (Mr  C)  that  he  might  have  shared
       information  disclosed  with  the  wider  Colombian  community.  The
       appellant contends that this was a serious breach  of  the  duty  of
       care by the police, and it is argued that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       erred by finding that this does not lead to an Article 3  ECHR  risk
       on return to Colombia for the appellant.

    7.  Secondly,  it  is  argued  that  there  was  a  failure  to  assess
       credibility properly. The  First-tier  Tribunal  had  accepted  that
       threats had been made to the appellant's grandmother  and  aunts  in
       Colombia, and that he was transferred and segregated  whilst  in  UK
       prisons due to risk. The First-tier Tribunal found that the  threats
       were not intense in the last part of his sentence however,  and  did
       not appreciate the impact of the authorities actions in reducing the
       threats, and failed to take into account the expert evidence from Dr
       Mathew Brown that the fact that threats had not been received in the
       UK did not mean that the appellant would not be at risk  of  revenge
       in Colombia.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  accept  that  the
       appellant had received a threatening telephone call recently due  to
       the delay in this threat being received and the failure to report it
       to the authorities by the appellant. It is argued that this was  not
       a rational conclusion given the telephone threat  was  plausible  in
       the context  of  the  accepted  historic  threats  to  relatives  in
       Colombia, and the fact that the cartel had lost �100,000 due to  the
       appellant's actions in informing to the British authorities, and had
       been exposed in part of their methods of importation of  drugs  into
       the UK through his having given information.

    8. Thirdly, it is argued that the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  by  not
       accrediting the public interest with requiring  recognition  of  the
       appellant's role as an informer. The public interest is not a fixity
       and  the  appellant's  actions  are  akin  to  those  who   make   a
       contribution to the community. In this way it  is  argued  that  the
       Article 8 ECHR exercise has not been lawfully conducted.

    9. The respondent did not supply a Rule 24 response.

   10. I indicated to the parties at the  start  of  the  hearing  that  my
       initial view was that the findings of the First-tier  Tribunal  that
       Mr C had no intention to do anything malicious with the evidence  of
       the appellant's information provided to  the  police  and  that  the
       recent telephone threat to the appellant had not  taken  place  were
       ones which were rationally open to the First-tier Tribunal  to  make
       and sufficiently reasoned. I  also  did  not  think  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in  relation  to  the  treatment  of  the  public
       interest. I indicted that I felt there was a more strongly  arguable
       error that the First-tier Tribunal had erred  in  law  when  finding
       that the appellant would not be seen as an informer if  returned  to
       Colombia in light of the expert evidence and the Tribunal's accepted
       findings regarding the appellant. I asked that Mr Bramble address me
       on this issue.

  Submissions - Error of Law and Remaking

   11. Mr Bramble argued, in summary,  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
       found that the appellant had not been subject to any  threats  as  a
       result of his information provided to HMRC in the UK since May  2010
       and that nothing had happened to  any  family  members  in  Colombia
       since 2005, when they had managed to evade such problems  by  moving
       to  Bogota.  He  argued  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was   able
       rationally to say that distance in time since  these  threats  meant
       that the appellant would no longer be seen as an informer and was no
       longer at risk as such on return. Further the expert report  focused
       on people who had informed in Colombia against drugs gangs there and
       the appellant had never done this. He drew my attention to paragraph
       4.1 of the report of Dr  Brown  which  referred  to  those  who  had
       "informed the police about drugs trafficking in Colombia" not  being
       able to live  safely,  and  the  fact  the  journalist  Luis  Carlos
       Cervantes, mentioned at  3.11  of  the  report,  was  someone  whose
       problems had seemingly arisen in Colombia and involved no element of
       problems arising abroad. Mr Bramble  questioned  why  the  appellant
       would be at more risk in Colombia than in the UK,  and  pointed  out
       that in the UK he had  experienced  no  problems  for  7  years.  He
       pointed out that the First-tier Tribunal had found that there was no
       evidence that Mr LG, the co-defendant who had received  the  longest
       sentence, had not been shown to have any continuing interest in  the
       appellant or any influence in Colombia. It was therefore open to the
       First-tier Tribunal to rationally conclude that  the  appellant  was
       not going to be seen as an informer by drugs dealers in Colombia  or
       as a person with any adverse interest in that country, as is done at
       paragraph 108 of the decision, and thus to discount the report of Dr
       Brown as irrelevant.

   12. After hearing these submissions I informed the parties that I  found
       that the First-tier Tribunal had  erred  in  law  on  the  basis  of
       failing to sufficiently reason why the appellant would not  be  seen
       as an informer about drugs dealing if returned to  Colombia,  as  is
       done at paragraph 108 of the decision, and thus for failing to  give
       sufficient reasons why the report of Dr Brown did not evidenced  him
       being at real risk of serious harm if returned to Colombia.  I  give
       my full reasons for this decision below. I said that I would  remake
       the appeal myself on the basis of the factual findings of the First-
       tier Tribunal but reconsidering the issue of whether  the  appellant
       remained an informer in the eyes of those who might wish to  subject
       such persons to serious harm in Colombia, and whether he would be at
       real risk of serious harm in light of the  totality  of  country  of
       origin evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal.  I  asked  for  any
       further  submissions  on  remaking.  Mr  Bramble  relied  upon   his
       submission as set out above. Mr Lewis  made  the  following  further
       submissions.

   13. Mr Lewis submitted that the First-tier Tribunal do not dispute  that
       the appellant's grandmother and aunt were subject to  threats  as  a
       result of his conviction and informing in  Colombia  in  2005  which
       compelled them to move to Bogota. It is accepted that the  appellant
       was targeted in prison by drug gang members  due  to  his  informing
       behaviour in 2008. Details of these threats are set out in documents
       from probation and a solicitor who wrote on the  appellant's  behalf
       to the director of Rye Hill prison, which appear at pages C1 and  C6
       of the Supplementary Index for Use at the Hearing  on  4th  and  5th
       October 2016.

   14. The expert evidence of Dr Brown, which is in no  way  challenged  or
       disputed as from a proper  expert,  states  at  paragraph  3.3  that
       "groups involved in drug trafficking have long memories,  and  pride
       themselves in bearing and maintaining grudges." It is clear that the
       evidence of  the  appellant's  conviction  and  lesser  sentence  is
       publicly available via the  internet,  see  paragraph  3.13  of  the
       report. It is also clear from  paragraph  3.13  that  violence  from
       Colombian gangs is "less frequent in the UK", indicating that the UK
       authorities provide  more  protection  than  other  states  and  are
       probably therefore deterring current threats.  From paragraph  3.11,
       and the example of Luis Carols Cervantes, it can be seen  that  when
       protection is withdrawn, even after a period of many years,  revenge
       can be taken against someone who is seen as having informed on  drug
       traffickers. It is also clear that the appellant would  be  unlikely
       to be provided with protection in Colombia due  to  his  low  social
       status and lack of political clout, see paragraph 3.7 of the report.



   15. It is absurd to submit that drugs traffickers would take a different
       view on those who inform to the authorities abroad compared to those
       who inform to the police in Colombia as drug trafficking is  by  its
       nature a cross-border activity. It  is  clear  that  the  crime  the
       appellant committed was an importation of a very large  quantity  of
       cocaine from  Colombia  to  the  UK,  see  letter  of  the  criminal
       solicitor who dealt with the matter at page 20 of  the  Supplemental
       Bundle for use at Hearing on 11th February 2014,  and  that  at  the
       point of the  trial  and  after  sentence  the  appellant  had  been
       understood by his co-defendant's to have informed to the authorities
       and suffered threats in prison as a result. It is  clear  from  this
       solicitor's evidence the appellant's  information  lead  customs  to
       discover hidden cash of more  than  �100,000.   Further  the  expert
       report gives examples of those who have been returned to  be  killed
       in Colombia from abroad, see paragraph  3.13  of  the  report  which
       comments on vendettas and murders of those returned from the USA  to
       Colombia. The report also expresses the  view  that  those  who  are
       informers are not just at risk from their own gangs  but  also  from
       other drugs cartels, see paragraph 4.6, so even if there is  a  lack
       of evidence of the current interest  of  the  appellant's  own  gang
       members this does not mean he would be safe.

   16. The report of Dr Brown is in conclusion categoric that  those,  like
       the appellant, who have informed about drugs trafficking cannot live
       safely in Colombia, see paragraphs 4.1 and 5.1 of the report.  As  a
       result, Mr Lewis submitted the appellant's appeal should be allowed.

   17. At the end of the hearing I reserved my determination.

Conclusions - Error of Law

   18. The key issue is whether the First-tier Tribunal decision,  made  at
       paragraph 108, that there is no real risk  the  applicant  would  be
       seen, if returned to Colombia, as an informer, is viable. The First-
       tier Tribunal found that Dr  Brown's  report  was  of  no  relevance
       because there was insufficient evidence that this would be the case.
       This is in turn said to be the case because the incidents in  prison
       cannot be linked directly with any issue of the appellant  being  an
       informer; because there is little known  about  the  leader  of  the
       appellant's gang; because there is nothing to  suggest  this  leader
       has an on-going interest in the appellant or reach in Colombia;  and
       because nothing has happened in terms of threats to the appellant or
       his family since 2008.

   19. The  expert,  Dr  Brown,  provides  evidence  that  if  googled  the
       appellant's name brings up details of his drugs conviction  and  the
       fact that his sentence was lesser  than  his  co-defendants.  It  is
       accepted by the First-tier Tribunal that:  "The  sentencing  remarks
       made in 2005 show that the assistance given to HMRC in locating  the
       secret compartment and  the  funds  was  reflected  in  the  shorter
       sentence given to the appellant,  thirteen  years  rather  than  the
       longest imposed  of  nineteen  years",  see  paragraph  102  of  the
       decision.  It is accepted by the First-tier  Tribunal  that  threats
       were made against the appellant in prison, see paragraph 104 of  the
       decision, and that he was moved to "safe locations on more than  one
       occasion", but it was  said  that  even  if  these  were  caused  by
       suspicion that he had assisted the authorities they had  "manifestly
       run their course  during  the  appellant's  sentence  and  were  not
       maintained with any intensity at all in the last  part  of  it".  It
       would appear that the last incident in prison was in 2008,  and  the
       appellant was released from prison in 2010. The First-tier  Tribunal
       does not appear to dispute that the appellant's aunt and grandmother
       were threatened in Colombian between 2003 and 2005 and had  to  move
       to Bogota, but it is clear that the First-tier Tribunal thought that
       these threats were now irrelevant, and did not  indicate  a  current
       risk, due to lapse of time, see paragraph 109 of the decision.

   20. It is accepted by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  appellant's
       history of being an informer was provided to Mr C who is married  to
       a Colombian and who had a "modest media presence in  the  past"  and
       who is a "film distributor" but not that he was intent on disclosing
       this information to the appellant's detriment, see paragraph 103  of
       the decision. I find that this finding is properly reasoned.  It  is
       not believed that the appellant received the recent telephone threat
       in January 2017. I find that this finding  was  for  cogent  reasons
       relating to a lack  of  complaint  or  report  to  the  police,  see
       paragraph 105 of the decision.

   21. There is no doubt the appellant is Colombian, that he  was  involved
       with a drugs gang with other Colombians and was convicted in the  UK
       of drugs importation from Colombia via Spain in April  2005  of  the
       importation of �2,500,000 of pure cocaine. The expert evidence of Dr
       Matthew Brown is that  drugs  traffickers  who  get  caught  by  the
       authorities are held personally liable for the loses (paragraph  3.3
       of his report at  page  7B  of  the  appellant's  bundle)  and  that
       "revenge through  violence"  is  one  of  the  means  commonly  used
       (paragraph 3.4, 3.6 and 3.13 of the same  report).  He  also  states
       that "Informers are not solely at risk from those they  inform  upon
       but, as the sources cited here attest, there are  many  cases  where
       informers have been targeted by other gangs,  or  other  groups,  as
       punishment  for  the  act  of  informing,  or   to   prevent   other
       compromising information being passed on", see paragraph 4.6 of  the
       report. Further that the state protection scheme  does  not  provide
       sufficiency of protection, see paragraph 3.9 - 3.11  of  Dr  Brown's
       report as it  cannot  be  seen  to  "offer  any  reliable  level  of
       protection to 'ordinary people' who report threats or blackmail,  or
       who inform on the activities of the organised criminal networks." It
       is categorically said to be "impossible to live safely and  publicly
       in Colombia as someone who  had  informed  the  police  about  drugs
       trafficking in Colombia", see paragraph 4.1.

   22. I find that the report of Dr Brown finds that there is a  real  risk
       of serious harm to anyone who "has  informed  to  the  police  about
       drugs-trafficking in Colombia." Dr Brown does not put a  time  limit
       on that risk. I find that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law  in
       concluding without reference to other evidence or greater  reasoning
       than is set out in the decision that the appellant was not  at  risk
       because any risk which might be indicated  by  the  initial  adverse
       action by co-defendants in the UK and threats to Colombian relatives
       has become negligible with the elapse of time.



Conclusions - Remaking

   23. I remake this decision only in relation to the Article 3 ECHR ground
       of appeal as no challenge is made to the legality of the  Article  8
       ECHR findings and conclusion.  My  remaking  is  based  on  the  key
       factual findings of the First-tier Tribunal that the  appellant  did
       receive a lesser sentence because he provided  information  to  HMRC
       about the whereabouts of a large amount of drugs money; that he  did
       receive threats in prison (the last of which were  in  2008)  during
       his sentence which may well have related to this fact; and that  his
       grandmother and aunt in Colombia had to move from their home area of
       Cali to Bogota (about 300km away) in 2005 due to threats as a result
       of his actions. It is not accepted that the appellant has  evidenced
       any threat arising from the passing of information  by  the  British
       police about the appellant's informing role  to  Mr  C;  it  is  not
       accepted that he recently received a threatening telephone  call  in
       January 2017; and there is no evidence provided to the Tribunal that
       the leader of the drug's gang in which the  appellant  was  involved
       has expressed any on-going interest in the appellant since  he  left
       prison in 2010 or has any particular power or involvement  with  any
       type of organised violence in Colombia.

   24. I place reliance in my assessment of risk on the expert report of Dr
       Matthew Brown, Reader in Latin American Studies at the University of
       Bristol who was commissioned to write his report by the  appellant's
       solicitors. I am satisfied that Dr Brown is  an  appropriate  expert
       who has relevant experience and research including working with  the
       Colombia embassy in the UK and with Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
       and making trips to Colombia and  meeting  with  Colombian  contacts
       including academics, politicians and those working  non-governmental
       organisations. He has been provided with full information about  the
       appellant's case and confirms that he understands his  duty  to  the
       court.

   25. Mr Bramble did not draw my attention to any other  relevant  country
       of origin  materials  or  make  any  submissions  that  it  was  not
       appropriate to give weight to the report of Dr Brown. I have however
       reviewed what is said in the reasons for refusal  letter  dated  4th
       February 2013 and the  country  of  origin  sources  cited  in  that
       letter. Most of the material cited is from the US  State  Department
       Report on Human Rights Practices in Colombia for 2011  and  supports
       what is stated at paragraph 33 of the  letter:  "that  the  security
       forces in Colombia suffer problems of corruption  and  commit  human
       rights abuses, and  that  the  legal  system  suffers  from  serious
       problems which led to a high rate of  impunity."  Perhaps  the  most
       significant contention is that the appellant could  find  safety  by
       internally relocating as Colombia is a large and populous country.

   26. The findings at paragraph 23  above  are  such  that  the  appellant
       should be seen as someone who has informed against a Colombian drugs
       gang to the authorities, and as someone about  whom  this  has  been
       publicly  known  or  strongly  suspected.  The   evidence   of   the
       appellant's  conviction  and  lesser   sentence   remains   publicly
       available via the internet, see paragraph 3.13 of Dr Brown's report.



   27. I do not find that the evidence of  Dr  Brown  is  supportive  of  a
       conclusion that lapse of time of a period of years (it is  now  nine
       years since the last problems experienced by the appellant  and  his
       family) means that there would be no risk to him as someone who  had
       informed against a gang of Colombian nationals  who  imported  drugs
       from Colombia.  At paragraph 3.3 of his report  it  is  stated  that
       "groups involved in drug trafficking have long memories,  and  pride
       themselves in bearing and maintaining grudges."  It  is  also  clear
       from paragraph 3.13 that violence  from  Colombian  gangs  is  "less
       frequent in the UK". I am satisfied that this indicates that the  UK
       authorities provide more robust protection than other states and are
       probably therefore deterring anyone who might currently wish to make
       threats, and thus in turn lack of threats in the UK is not probative
       that they would not take place in Colombia.  From paragraph 3.11  of
       Dr Brown's report, and the  example  of  Luis  Carols  Cervantes,  I
       accept that it can be seen that when protection is  withdrawn,  even
       after a period of many years, revenge can be taken  against  someone
       who is seen as having informed on drug traffickers. I also find that
       the appellant would be unlikely to be provided with  sufficiency  of
       protection in Colombia due to his low  social  status  and  lack  of
       political clout, see paragraphs 3.7, 3.9 - 3.11 of Dr Brown's report
       as  Colombia  cannot  be  seen  to  "offer  any  reliable  level  of
       protection to 'ordinary people' who report threats or blackmail,  or
       who inform on the activities of the  organised  criminal  networks."
       The report also expresses the view that those who are informers  are
       not just at risk from their own gangs  but  also  from  other  drugs
       cartels, see paragraph 4.6, so the accepted lack of evidence of  any
       current interest of the appellant's own gang members does  not  mean
       that the appellant cannot show a real risk of serious harm.

   28. I do not accept Mr Bramble's argument that drugs  traffickers  would
       take a different view of those who inform to the authorities  abroad
       compared to those who inform to the police in Colombia. As Mr  Lewis
       has submitted, drug trafficking is  by  its  nature  a  cross-border
       activity. The crime the appellant committed was an importation of  a
       very large quantity of cocaine from Colombia to the UK,  see  letter
       of the criminal solicitor who dealt with the matter at  page  20  of
       the Supplemental Bundle for use at Hearing on  11th  February  2014.
       The report of Dr Brown also gives examples of drugs traffickers  who
       have been returned from the USA after years abroad to be  killed  in
       Colombia, see paragraph 3.13 of the  report.  Further  the  risk  Dr
       Brown identifies in his final conclusion is reliant on the appellant
       having "informed to the police about a drugs-trafficking matter" not
       having informed to the  Colombian  police,  although  clearly  there
       should be a link (which  I  find  exists  in  this  case)  to  drugs
       trafficking in  Colombia,  as  is  evident  from  what  is  said  at
       paragraph 4.1 of the report.

   29. In light of the evidence  of  Dr  Brown  I  do  not  find  that  the
       appellant could find safety by way of internal relocation.  No  area
       has been identified where drugs gangs do not  have  the  ability  to
       operate within Colombia, and I find that the risk he  faces  extends
       throughout the territory.

   30. I therefore accept Mr Lewis's submission that the report of Dr Brown
       is clear in its conclusion that those, like the appellant,  who  are
       known to have informed about issues of drugs trafficking in Colombia
       to the authorities cannot live safely in  Colombia,  see  paragraphs
       4.1 and 5.1 of the report. The evidence presented  by  Dr  Brown  is
       that this would lead to a real risk of the appellant facing  violent
       attacks, torture and murder. I am satisfied that the return  of  the
       appellant to Colombia would  therefore  represent  a  real  risk  of
       serious harm to him.



          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

   3. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it on the basis  that
      the deportation of the  appellant  would  be  a  breach  of  the  UK's
      obligations under Article 3 ECHR.


    Direction Regarding Anonymity -  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings. I do so in order to avoid  a  likelihood
    of serious harm arising to the appellant and the  appellant's  children
    from the contents of his protection claim.
