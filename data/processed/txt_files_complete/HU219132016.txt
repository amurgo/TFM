               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     None
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In a decision promulgated on 14th November 2017 an  error  of  law  was
    found in a First-tier Tribunal decision promulgated on 18th  July  2017
    which allowed the appeal of the appellant  against  a  refusal  to  his
    protection and human rights claim in the face of  a  deportation  order
    made under Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.  As set out in the
    Secretary  of  State's  reasons  for  refusal  letter  the  appellant's
    deportation was required by Section 32(5) unless an  exception  applied
    because he was a foreign criminal who had been sentenced to a period of
    imprisonment of at least twelve months and as such his deportation  was
    conducive to the public good.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Sierra Leone with  a  mother  who  was  a
    citizen of New Guinea and he was born in 1993. He is now 25 years  old.
    He was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK on  27th  September
    2001.

 3. In the First-tier Tribunal decision  the  chronology  of  his  criminal
    activity was set out as follows

    '5.    The respondent set out her position in full in the  reasons  for
         refusal letter.

    6.     The chronology of criminal activity is as follows:

         26.10.11 using threatening, abusive, insulting words  or  behaviour
                  with intent to cause fear or provocation of violence.

                  Fine �50, costs �85, Victim surcharge �15

         3.3.14   using vehicle while disqualified, driving  other  than  in
                  accordance with a licence, failing to surrender to custody



                  Fine �110 (plus �70 for failing to surrender), costs  �85,
                  victim  surcharge  �20,  Disqualified  from  driving -  6
                  months, licence endorsed.

         11.11.14 Robbery

                  42 months imprisonment.

         12.3.15  Burglary and theft (not  a  dwelling)/Burglary  and  theft
                  (dwelling)

                  3 months imprisonment (concurrent) Victim surcharge �80

    7.     The sentencing remarks of the Judge dealing with the case on  22
         December 2014 are included in the respondent's bundle:

             "... you entered the Talk Talk shop on the Norwood High Street
             and you robbed it ...  I  am  perfectly  satisfied  that  that
             robbery was pre-planned by you ... you  threatened  the  owner
             ... you implied that you had a weapon of  some  sort  ...  you
             stole the contents of a charity box ... you  are  entitled  to
             some credit although not full credit in light of the fact that
             your initial reaction was not to accept  your  guilt  in  that
             case ... you were allowed bail ... the judge indicated to  you
             that the report would be an all options report ... in the face
             of all that, on the 18 December, you went  into  another  shop
             ... and you stole ... to the value of  just  over  �1,000  ...
             that must be in my judgement a serious aggravating feature ...
             the planning ... is a  serious  aggravating  feature  ...  the
             threat that you used is an aggravating feature ... the  taking
             of the charity box is an aggravating feature in  my  judgement
             ... the commission of the (second) offence on the back of  the
             fact that you  had  been  granted  your  bail  was  a  serious
             aggravating feature ... mitigation ... you are still  a  young
             man ... you have nothing of a similar nature ...  you  have  a
             young family ..."

 4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge decision was set aside because the  judge
    appeared, when allowing the appeal, to have failed to take into account
    her adverse findings with respect to the appellant and failed to factor
    in the relatively short period of time since the appellant was released
    when considering his re-offending or lack of  it.   Her  conclusion  at
    paragraph 89 such that "overall I do not find very serious  reasons  to
    justify his expulsion" ran counter to the overall findings of the judge
    and the decision was inadequately reasoned in the light of  the  public
    interest considerations and guidance given in Hesham Ali v SSHD  [2016]
    UKSC 60.

 5. In essence an error of law was also found because  the  judge  had  not
    explained why the fact the appellant having lived here all his life  in
    the UK and was presumed  to  have  been  born  here  would  necessarily
    override the public interest factor in deporting him.  At  the  hearing
    before me Mr Tufan submitted that there was in fact  no  evidence  that
    the appellant was born here and even if that was the case Uner and  the
    Netherlands [2006] ECHR 873 confirmed that even where someone was  born
    in a country but was a citizen of another country  he  could  still  be
    expelled.  Mr Tufan also submitted that the appellant had  provided  no
    evidence that the children with which he asserted he had a relationship
    were indeed his biological children.

 6. At the resumed hearing before me the appellant did not attend  and  his
    solicitors  Samuel  Ross  Solicitors  notified  the  Tribunal  on  19th
    February 2008 some four  days  prior  to  the  hearing  that  they  had
    received no further instructions from the appellant and  would  not  be
    representing him at the hearing on 23rd February 2018.   There  was  no
    application by the appellant for an adjournment and he did  not  attend
    the hearing before me.  There  was  some  evidence  that  in  fact  the
    appellant had been reconvicted on 15th September  2017  for  possession
    with intent to supply of a class A drug (heroin),  pleaded  guilty  and
    was imprisoned for 32 months.  At the same time  he  was  convicted  of
    possession of crack cocaine and again was concurrently  imprisoned  for
    32 months.  I considered whether to adjourn the hearing  but  concluded
    that the appellant had been notified of the date, time and venue of the
    hearing by way of his previous solicitors and had made  no  application
    for an adjournment or an application to be produced.  As  can  be  seen
    from my error of law decision I preserve the findings of the judge made
    between paragraphs 47 and  86.   There  were  no  challenges  to  those
    findings and I refer to my error of law decision in which  I summarised
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings as follows

         "6.      The  [First-tier  Tribunal  Judge]  judge  throughout  the
             determination made various findings which were not helpful  to
             the  appellant  such  that  the  appellant  was   deliberately
             untruthful in his relationship  with  his  father,  [paragraph
             53], that his relationship  with  his  children  was  new  and
             overall appeared slender and that the judge was not  satisfied
             that at the date of the hearing it amounted to a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship because  of  the  absence  of
             involvement before release from prison, [paragraph  61].   The
             judge found it would not be unduly  harsh  for  the  child  to
             remain in the UK without the person who  is  to  be  deported,
             [paragraph 61], and further, that the  relationship  with  the
             appellant's said partner was not as long-lived, as  submitted.
             Overall in view of the inconsistencies on  their  evidence  of
             their relationship  the  judge  was  not  satisfied  that  the
             appellant and his partner were in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship, [paragraph 66].  The judge concluded, [paragraph
             69], that it would not be unduly harsh for the said partner to
             remain in the UK without the appellant.  At paragraph 71,  the
             judge concluded the appellant had not  maintained  close  ties
             with Sierra Leone but the judge was not satisfied there  would
             be very significant obstacles to his integration  into  Sierra
             Leone because he had good health, literacy and numeracy skills
             and experience of working.

         7. Further, at paragraph 73 the  judge  found  that  the  appellant
             would be financially supported with the advice and contacts of
             his family and the wider community from Sierra  Leone  and  he
             was at present in receipt of financial support from his family
             and this would continue, [paragraph 73].

         8. As such the judge found that there were  no  exceptions  engaged
             [paragraph 75] and proceeded  to  consider  the  facts  as  to
             whether there were very compelling circumstances  to  outweigh
             the requirement of deportation.

         9. The judge then applied Section 117C as she was obliged to do and
             noted that the relationship formed with  Ms  C  was  during  a
             period when the appellant had lawful leave in the UK but  that
             there was no other evidence of significant private life.   She
             also noted that as an adult he had  a  relationship  with  his
             mother and siblings but there was  "some  dissembling  in  the
             evidence given about how familiar  they  each  were  with  the
             movements of the other", paragraph 84.

         10.      The judge had not accepted that the relationship with  the
             partner and the children  was  subsisting  but  moreover  that
             deportation would not be unduly harsh:

             "86.      Turning to  Exception  2,  as  set  out  in  section
                  117C(5), I find that he  has  no  genuine  and  subsisting
                  relationship with a qualifying partner.  In reaching  this
                  conclusion I rely on my previous finding  that  he  has  a
                  current relationship with her and a  current  relationship
                  with his 2 children, however, both are recent and I am not
                  satisfied  that  they  qualify  as  subsisting.   For  the
                  reasons set out above  I  find  that  the  effect  of  the
                  deportation will not be unduly harsh on his partner or the
                  children.""

 7. The appellant could not in view of the findings cited above satisfy the
    exceptions to paragraph 398 such that he had a genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with a  child  or  with  a  partner.   The  judge
    clearly found that it would not be unduly harsh for the child to remain
    in the UK without the person who is to be deported further to paragraph
    399(a)(2)(b).

 8. Turning to paragraphs 399A  to 399C I set them out as follows

    399A.  This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies  if
           -

           (a)   the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most
                of his life; and

           (b)   he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

           (c)    there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   his
                integration into the country to which it is proposed  he  is
                deported.

    399B.  Where an Article 8 claim from a foreign criminal is successful:

           (a)   in the case of a person who is in  the  UK  unlawfully  or
                whose leave to enter or  remain  has  been  cancelled  by  a
                deportation order, limited leave may be granted for  periods
                not exceeding 30 months and subject to  such  conditions  as
                the Secretary of State considers appropriate;

           (b)   in the case of a person who has not  been  served  with  a
                deportation order, any limited leave to enter or remain  may
                be curtailed  to  a  period  not  exceeding  30  months  and
                conditions may be varied to such conditions as the Secretary
                of State considers appropriate;

           (c)   indefinite leave to enter or remain may be  revoked  under
                section 76 of the 2002 Act and limited  leave  to  enter  or
                remain granted for a period not exceeding 30 months  subject
                to such conditions  as  the  Secretary  of  State  considers
                appropriate;

           (d)   revocation of a deportation order does  not  confer  entry
                clearance or leave to enter  or  remain  or  re-instate  any
                previous leave.

    399C.  Where a foreign criminal  who  has  previously  been  granted  a
           period of limited leave under  this  Part  applies  for  further
           limited leave or indefinite  leave  to  remain  his  deportation
           remains conducive to the public good and in the public  interest
           notwithstanding the previous grant of leave.

 9. Although the appellant had lived in the UK lawfully  for  most  of  his
    life, bearing in mind his terms of imprisonment and the  fact  that  he
    has been once again imprisoned there is no evidence that he is socially
    and  culturally  integrated  into  the  United  Kingdom.   The  various
    provisions under 399A are conjunctive and as  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge found, (findings preserved) there would be  no  very  significant
    obstacles to his reintegration into  Sierra  Leone.   I  make  a  broad
    evaluative assessment in relation to  his  integration  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Most of his life was spent in the UK and most of it  lawfully
    resident but a finding in relation to his lack of  offences  since  his
    release from prison in May 2016 does not assist him,  considering   the
    very short period since his release and his further  recent  conviction
    and imprisonment as cited above.   He may have cultural and family ties
    in the UK and his ties in Sierra Leone may be less secure  and  I  take
    into account that Sierra Leone may have a  severely  depressed  economy
    and that its life expectancy, income and standard  of  living  bear  no
    comparison with the counterparts in the United Kingdom, but the country
    guidance authorities on Sierra Leone do not identify a general risk  on
    return because of the country conditions.  The appellant cannot  comply
    with the exceptions to paragraph 398

10. The Supreme Court in Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC  60  confirmed  that
    the Strasbourg case law assisted in determining the relevant factors to
    be taken into account  but with  reference  to  the  Immigration  Rules
    identified at [38] that

         "Cases not  covered  by  those  rules  (that  is  to  say,  foreign
         offenders who have received sentences of at least  four  years,  or
         who have received sentences of between 12 months and four years but
         whose private or family life does  not  meet  the  requirements  of
         rules 399 and 399A) will be dealt with  on  the  basis  that  great
         weight should generally be given to the public interest"

11. As LW Jamaica [2016] EWCA  Civ  369  rehearsed,  essentially  to  found
    "compelling reasons" for not deporting an appellant, considerably  more
    is required than just the passage of  time.   Indeed  the  question  of
    passage of time was considered in that authority and it  was  found  at
    paragraph 36 that

         "The relationship between the length of residence,  the  length  of
         sentence and the gravity of the offending (consider,  for  example,
         murder, rape and terrorism) would require careful consideration  on
         a fact-specific basis, always keeping in mind that the reasons need
         to be compelling to outweigh the very strong public interest in the
         deportation of foreign criminals".

12. Elias LJ  opined at paragraph 38 that he was not  saying  that  on  the
    facts it might not be open to a Tribunal to conclude  that  there  were
    compelling reasons  for  not  deporting  an  appellant  based  on  long
    residence  "so  as  to  make  deportation  unconscionable  despite  his
    sentence for dealing in class A drugs", but - and an important but - it
    mattered to public  confidence  that  any  such  decision  was  reached
    appropriately, after due regard is  had  to  the  great  weight  to  be
    attached to the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals
    and with "exceptional circumstances"  properly  understood  as  meaning
    "compelling reasons".

13. This appellant has indeed lived in the United Kingdom for most  of  his
    life since he was born in 1993.  He is now nearly 25 years old and  has
    not lived in Sierra Leone.  He has been convicted of robbery in October
    2014, when an adult, and sentenced to 42 months' imprisonment  and  was
    convicted on 12th March 2015 for burglary and theft and  sentenced  to
    three months' imprisonment.  Again he has been convicted for a  serious
    offence of possession and supply of class A drugs and sentenced to  two
    years and eight months in prison as recently as September  2017.   That
    was despite him being placed on licence on 12th May 2016.  His sentence
    was due to expire on 12th May 2018.  His "initial single sentence plan"
    (ISSP) in relation to his previous sentence and dated 19th January 2015
    appears to have been updated as at 8th August  2015  and  assessed  his
    overall risk of serious harm level to be medium.

14. The pre-sentence report dated 15th December 2014 identified in relation
    to the offence of robbery on 5th October 2014 that it was

         "A very serious offence where an innocent member was  subjected  to
         threats of harm and had items and money stolen from  his  place  of
         work [a  shop]  where  the  appellant  approached  the  victim  and
         demanded money and threatened to hurt him if he did not comply with
         his demands".

15. The conclusion in that report by the probation officer held

         "... it is  my  assessment  that  unless  Mr  Marah  addresses  the
         motivations for this offence he will continue  to  offend  in  this
         manner".

16. In that report it is recorded that the appellant left school with seven
    GCSEs, went on to college to study electronics and he was in  a  second
    year  of  a  four  year  degree  studying   information   systems   and
    engineering.

17. The report also identified that the appellant had no problems in  terms
    of his mental health, had never self-harmed and had never had  suicidal
    ideation.  He had not been  prescribed  with  any  medication  for  any
    mental health problems and he stated that he had never tried any  drugs
    and did not consume alcohol.  Nonetheless the appellant was assessed at
    that date as posing a medium risk of harm to the public  and  a  medium
    risk of re-offending.  The risk he posed, and on  the  evidence,  still
    poses is robbery and threatening and abusive behaviour.  The  appellant
    was recorded as not open to discussing his offending in  interview  and
    the probation officer was not  aware  of  the  factors  motivating  his
    behaviour.  It was possibly linked to financial motives.

18. What is abundantly clear  is  that  despite  his  time  in  prison  the
    appellant re-offended shortly after his release, has been convicted and
    again sentenced to imprisonment for a serious offence.

19. I have taken into account the  Immigration  Rules  which  set  out  the
    Secretary of State's position.  I have adopted the approach to  Article
    8 as set out in Hesham Ali and find  that  in  all  the  circumstances,
    there are no  compelling  circumstances  in  this  appeal  and  nothing
    presented to undermine the justification for deportation.
