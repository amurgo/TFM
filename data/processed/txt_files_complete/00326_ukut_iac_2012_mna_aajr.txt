                                  JUDGMENT

Introduction

1.    The claimant in the present proceedings asserts that he  is  a  minor,
    currently aged 17, who is  unsure  of  his  exact  date  of  birth  but
    believes that he turned 13 years of age in or around the early part  of
    2008.  In accordance  with  normal  practice,  the  claimant's  current
    position is that he should be treated for the purposes of the  Children
    Act 1989 as having been born on 1st January 1995.

2.    In an age assessment dated 9th December 2010, the  defendant  assessed
    the claimant's age, so as to give him a date of birth  of  1st  January
    1992.  That determination of the claimant's age is the subject  of  the
    application for judicial review, permission to  make  that  application
    having been granted by a deputy judge of the High  Court  on  20th  May
    2011.

3.    It is common ground that the claimant is a citizen of Afghanistan  who
    arrived in the United Kingdom on 28th July 2008 in the back of a lorry.
      Following  his  interception  by  the  police,  the  claimant  sought
    international protection, asserting a  fear  of  persecution  from  the
    authorities in Afghanistan and also from the Taliban.

4.    The claimant's application for asylum was refused by the Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department on 10th October 2008 but on that day  the
    claimant was granted discretionary leave to remain until 1st July 2009.
     Further application by the claimant for a variation of  his  leave  to
    remain was refused by the Secretary of State on  27th  September  2011.
    The claimant has appealed that decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    Immigration and Asylum Chamber, which has adjourned the hearing of  the
    appeal, pending the outcome of these proceedings.

The Law

5.    Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in R  (A)  v  Croydon  LBC
    [2009] 1 WLR 2557, the task for me in these proceedings is  to  resolve
    the issue of the claimant's age, as a matter of  fact.   In  R  (AE)  v
    London Borough of Croydon [2012] EWCA Civ 547 Aikens LJ said that:-

         "This is because the determination of the young person's age  is  a
         'precedent fact' to the local authority  exercising  its  statutory
         powers under section 20(1) of the 1989 Act.  There is a right and a
         wrong answer and that, ultimately, is for the court to decide." [3]

6.    In carrying  out  that  exercise,  I  must,  effectively,  act  in  an
    inquisitorial role,  and  decide,  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,
    whether the claimant was or was not a child at  the  material  time  (R
    (AE) at [23] and R (CJ) v Cardiff CC [2011] EWCA Civ 1590 at  [22]  and
    [23]).

7.    There is no burden of proof in these proceedings  (R  (CJ)  at  [22]).
    So far as the "benefit of the doubt" is concerned, Mr Suterwalla  cited
    R (KN) v  London  Borough  of  Barnett  [2011]  EWHC  2019  (Admin)  as
    authority for the proposition that, where a  local  authority  has  not
    given the claimant the benefit of the  doubt,  the  court  or  tribunal
    should do so.  It is, however, plain from [21] of R (CJ) that the Court
    of Appeal was not disposed to recognise  any  formal  "benefit  of  the
    doubt" approach in the judicial determination of a person's age.   But,
    as the court also makes clear in that paragraph of  its  judgment,  the
    judicial fact finder is not thereby expected to eschew  a  "sympathetic
    assessment of evidence" and "in evaluating the evidence it may well  be
    inappropriate to expect from the claimant conclusive evidence of age in
    circumstances in which he has arrived unattended and  without  original
    identity documents.  The nature of  the  evaluation  of  evidence  will
    depend upon the particular facts of the case."

8.    Without in any way detracting from the ultimate requirement to  decide
    on the  balance  of  probabilities  what  the  claimant's  age  is,  in
    analysing the various evidential elements, I follow the  approach  just
    mentioned, as well as having  regard  to  possible  cultural  and  age-
    related explanations for what might otherwise be regarded as  flaws  or
    deficiencies in that evidence.


The hearing

9.    The hearing took place over five days.  I  heard  oral  evidence  from
    the  claimant,  for  this  purpose  (after  discussion  with,  and  the
    agreement of, Counsel) sitting in the body of the  court  in  order  to
    provide a more conducive environment for  him  to  give  his  evidence.
    Oral evidence was also given by Maureen McCamley; Hugh Perkiss; Valbina
    Mejzini; Michael Woodbine; Denise  Collins;  Lucrecia  Brouf;  Nomfundo
    Nyaba; Roxana Salimi; Megan Clement; and Gideon Obeng.  These witnesses
    spoke to their written witness statements, in most cases set out in the
    ring binders of  documents  served  pursuant  to  the  Tribunal's  case
    management  directions.   Also  in  those  bundles  are   the   witness
    statements of  individuals  who  did  not  give  oral  evidence  (Helen
    Johnson; Anwar Wazrirwal; and Joe Jakes), as  well  as  a  considerable
    amount of other documentation in the form of  reports,  letters,  notes
    and emails.  In addition, during the course of the  hearing,  materials
    were submitted comprising a bail  profile  report  in  respect  of  the
    claimant; email correspondence between Lucrecia Brouf and Michael Baron
    concerning an earlier age assessment in respect of the  claimant;  copy
    YOYS sentencing history on claimant; email exchange  relating  to  2008
    refusal of asylum; and  pre-sentence  report  on  claimant  (21st  June
    2012).  On 16th July, in response to submissions by  Mr  Suterwalla,  I
    gave directions to  the  governor  of  Cookham  Wood  Young  Offenders'
    Institution to disclose a security information report relating  to  the
    claimant and  an  extract  from  the  observations  log,  concerning  a
    conversation that took place on 23rd June 2012 at Cookham Wood  between
    the claimant and Mr Woodbine  (acting  as  deputy  governor)  at  which
    Denise Collins was also present ("the Cookham  Wood  incident").   That
    direction was complied with and relevant materials were served  on  the
    parties, who were given until  30th  July  2012  to  make  any  written
    response.  The defendant has chosen to  make  a  substantive  response.
    The claimant indicated that he did not wish to make any submissions  on
    the documentation, save to say that he wished  to  rely  upon  and  re-
    emphasise the submissions made about the "Cookham Wood incident"  given
    at the hearing.

10.   Although the  materials  before  me  include  age  assessment  medical
    reports on the claimant, including that  of  Dr  Diana  Birch,  neither
    party at the hearing urged me to have regard to this  medical  evidence
    in assessing the claimant's age.  Notwithstanding the  holistic  nature
    of my task, one has to start somewhere; and, in view  of  what  I  have
    just said about the medical age-assessment evidence, it is  appropriate
    for me to begin by considering the credibility of the claimant.


The claimant's credibility

11.   The claimant confirmed as true his two  witness  statements.   In  the
    first of these, he says his father disappeared before the claimant came
    to the United Kingdom.  The claimant left Afghanistan in early 2008 and
    he thought it was  about  a  year  before  this  that  his  father  had
    disappeared.  He would have estimated his father as  being  between  40
    and 45 years old at the time  of  his  disappearance.   The  claimant's
    mother was about 40.  The claimant's brother, I, was younger  than  the
    claimant, as was his sister, S.  He  did  not  know  the  ages  of  his
    siblings.  He came from a village in the district of Helmand  Province.
    His home had three or four rooms and  the  family's  land  amounted  to
    three or four jiribs (1 jirib = 150 metres x 100 metres).  The claimant
    was injured in an explosion just outside his village when  "I  think  I
    was about 10 years old at the time".  This was caused by an  airstrike.
    The person next to him was killed.

12.   The claimant said that  he  had  told  the  social  workers  that  his
    journey to the UK took "27 nights".  He  had  not  attended  school  in
    Afghanistan since there was no madrassa attached  to  the  mosque.   He
    learned to read some of the Qur'an, with the assistance of his  mother.
    He could also read some Pashtu and speak some Dari.  He claimed he  did
    not have an ID or Taskira in Afghanistan.

13.   The claimant took issue with both of the age assessments.  So  far  as
    the 2010 assessment was concerned, the claimant explained that  he  was
    able to remember events in Afghanistan because they were vivid and  had
    had a  significant  effect  on  his  life.     The  claimant  described
    difficulties that he had had, including his admission to the  Bethlehem
    Royal Hospital.  As for being described as "streetwise",  including  on
    the basis that the claimant had been shoplifting in Lewisham,  he  said
    that he had got into trouble because he found it difficult to cope with
    his life.  Noting  that  the  social  workers  had  accepted  that  the
    claimant required  some  psychological  support  to  deal  with  trauma
    experienced as a child in Afghanistan, the claimant denied that he  had
    provided "articulate and informative" answers to  the  social  workers.
    Ms Mejzini, who was present  with  the  claimant  at  the  discussions,
    confirmed that for most of the interview  the  claimant  had  sat  head
    down, mumbling answers.  He denied that he  had  been  "articulate  and
    informative".

14.   The claimant's cross-examination by Mr Hadden began by emphasising  to
    the claimant that he should say if he did not understand a question and
    that he would be able to have frequent breaks if he so chose.  I  shall
    deal with that cross-examination, and the resultant re-examination,  in
    the  course  of  giving  my  reasons  for  my  findings  regarding  the
    claimant's credibility.

15.   The claimant's second witness statement relates to  the  Cookham  Wood
    incident of June 2012.  I deal with that incident  below.   Because  of
    the necessarily  late  production  of  the  witness  statements  of  Mr
    Woodbine and Ms Collins, the claimant's advisors were given time by  me
    to take the claimant's instructions on what those witnesses said.   The
    claimant was then recalled to give oral evidence  about  the  incident.
    Again, this evidence is dealt with below.

16.   Throughout the course  of  his  oral  evidence,  I  ensured  that  the
    claimant understood the interpreter and was periodically invited to say
    whether he wished to have a break from giving evidence.  I also wish to
    emphasise that, in considering the claimant's credibility,  I  bear  in
    mind that it appears to be common ground that he may  have  encountered
    traumatic experiences in Afghanistan and that, whether or not he is the
    age he claims, he would in the view of most people be a  young  person.
    Furthermore, I  bear  in  mind  the  written  medical  evidence,  which
    includes a medical report of Dr Roth (C 93 - 95; 10th March 2010) and a
    psychiatric report of Dr Judith Freeman (C 25 - 45; 3rd May 2011).  The
    first  of  these  reports  arose  as  a  result   of   the   claimant's
    hospitalisation following fighting with a man  who,  according  to  the
    claimant, had short-changed him in his purchase of a mobile  telephone.
    Having been admitted to Bethlehem  Royal  Hospital,  the  claimant  was
    observed over a number of days but it was concluded that  "he  was  not
    currently mentally ill, and with no evidence of depression or of actual
    suicide risk".  The claimant was accordingly discharged.  Dr Freedman's
    report stated that the claimant "may be suffering  from  PTSD  together
    with cognitive and/or  other  psychological  disturbances.   The  exact
    constellation of diagnoses will become clearer over time.  He is now  a
    young person who is in need of special  care".  An  independent  social
    worker, writing in July 2010, had considered it was "most  likely"  the
    claimant "suffers from chronic PTSD".

17.   Yet despite all this, and leaving aside for the moment  my  assessment
    of the Cookham Wood incident, there are various aspects of the evidence
    that are seriously problematic,  so  far  as  concerns  the  claimant's
    credibility.  At  his  first  age  assessment  in  September  2008  the
    claimant told the social workers (see  42)  that  "one  year  ago,  his
    mother told him he was 13 years old".  In his witness statement at B10,
    however, the claimant said "on 9th September 2010 I  underwent  an  age
    assessment interview with the London Borough of Croydon.  My mother had
    told me that I was 13 years of age.  This was of course before  I  left
    Afghanistan.  It was about four or five months before my interview that
    I had been told by my mother that I was 13."   In  oral  evidence,  the
    claimant said that the period had been three or four  months.   At  his
    second age assessment (F10) the claimant "stated that he was 13.5 years
    old when he  arrived  in  the  UK  in  2008  ...  the  assessors  asked
    [claimant] to explain how he knew he was born in 1995  and  he  replied
    "my mother told me".  The assessors asked him to confirm the date  that
    his mother had told him his age and he reports that it  was  before  he
    left Afghanistan."

18.   Mr Perkiss, in  his  evidence,  acknowledged  that  the  first  letter
    before action (C 83) had also recorded the period as one  year  between
    the first age assessment and the occasion when the  claimant  was  told
    his age.  Mr Perkiss, however, said that he had made a mistake and that
    the position was as  later  recorded  by  the  claimant.   Evidence  to
    similar effect was given by Ms McCamley.

19.    Whilst  in  no  way  questioning  the  good  faith   of   those   two
    professionals, I see no reason to doubt what was recorded in the  first
    age assessment, despite Mr Suterwalla's criticism of the way  in  which
    that document was compiled.

20.   In oral evidence, the claimant said that the  occasion  on  which  his
    mother had seen fit to tell him his age was when a female friend of the
    mother came to visit, bringing with her a child.  The claimant's mother
    took the opportunity to tell the claimant that he was the same  age  as
    this child.

21.   Mr Hadden, not surprisingly, took issue with this evidence,  since  it
    had not featured in any previous  statement  or  other  written  record
    relating to the claimant.  I then heard evidence from Mr Perkiss,  who,
    having referred to his notes, stated that the claimant  had,  in  fact,
    previously told him that this was how the claimant's  age  came  to  be
    disclosed.  Again, I do not doubt Mr Perkiss's evidence.   Furthermore,
    the revelation of this detail provides  some  further  support  for  Mr
    Suterwalla's  submission  that,  in  several  material  respects,   the
    claimant's account had remained consistent throughout.

22.   Nevertheless, Mr  Hadden's  submissions  on  this  issue  have  force.
    First, if such was the  circumstance  in  which  the  mother  told  the
    claimant his age, it is highly surprising that he had not been told  it
    earlier.  Secondly, in the light of the claimant's evidence  about  the
    mother's relative lack of education, and  the  absence  of  any  formal
    written record regarding the claimant's birth,  there  is  no  credible
    explanation for why the mother would  herself  know  this  information.
    Thirdly, both in his screening interview and elsewhere (C 5, 19-20, 32-
    33 and 41) the claimant was unable to give the ages of his parents but,
    by the time of his  first  written  statement,  he  could  (as  I  have
    indicated earlier) give the ages  with  some  degree  of  accuracy  and
    confidence.  Cross-examined as to how this could be, the claimant  said
    that he did not know (an answer which he adopted very frequently during
    the course of his oral evidence).

23.   Similarly, the claimant said in his  written  statement  that  he  was
    about ten years old when he was injured in the airstrike.  Asked by  Mr
    Hadden how he knew this, the claimant again said that he did not  know.
    Both here and frequently during the evidence of the claimant, one could
    not escape the conclusion that the claimant was, despite his ostensible
    demeanour, aware of the purport of the questions  and  was  seeking  to
    deflect them by resorting to claimed ignorance.

24.   Further evidence of this  kind  is  to  be  found  in  the  claimant's
    assertion that it took him 27 days (or  nights)  to  reach  the  United
    Kingdom.  That evidence demonstrates a good memory and sense  of  time;
    which is, I consider, why the claimant has belatedly sought  to  resile
    from it by means of the assertion that it  was  information  that  came
    from companions on the journey.  Nor am I persuaded by the assertion at
    B13 of the witness statement that the claimant "cannot be exactly  sure
    how long my journey to the UK took".

25.   Whilst I am prepared to accept that there may  be  social  differences
    between the United Kingdom and Afghanistan as  regards  the  importance
    given to a person's age, and as to the  passage  of  time,  equally  it
    would be na�ve to ignore the indications  (recorded  in  the  case  law
    concerning age-disputed persons from Afghanistan) that there are people
    in that country who are well  aware  of  the  advantages  (both  as  to
    welfare and claims to be made in need of international  protection)  to
    be gained by pretending that a person coming from that country  to  the
    United Kingdom is a child, when they are not.

26.   The claimant has been seriously  discrepant  regarding  the  means  of
    travel he employed on his way from Afghanistan to the  United  Kingdom.
    In his screening interview (C 6) the claimant describes  travelling  by
    aeroplane which stopped, he thought, in an Arab country, from which  he
    flew to another place before being taken to a "forest" where he was put
    in a vehicle and then taken to a "house"  where  he  stayed  for  three
    days.  A further vehicle was used to reach  another  forest,  where  he
    stayed for twelve days.  In the claimant's asylum statement (C  35)  he
    also describes travelling part of the way by aircraft.   In  his  first
    age assessment (C 42) the claimant described several  journeys  by  air
    from and to airports as well as using a "small boat" and then  "another
    boat" before going by "ship".

27.   In oral evidence, the claimant  on  several  occasions  denied  having
    used air transport.  He appeared to blame an interpreter for  what  had
    been recorded in the screening interview.  He either denied or did  not
    remember referring to a forest.  Significantly,  at  one  point  during
    cross-examination on this issue, the claimant asked Mr Hadden "are  you
    checking my age?"  It appeared  to  me  that  the  claimant's  somewhat
    cavalier attitude towards the evidence on this issue can be ascribed to
    his belief that it has no part to play in the assessment of his age.  I
    consider that  it  does;  and  that  it  is  significant  in  assessing
    credibility that the  claimant  is  unable  to  give  a  comprehensible
    account of a  journey  which,  for  him,  was  both  unprecedented  and
    potentially life-changing.

28.   Both parties  addressed  me  on  the  significance,  if  any,  of  the
    claimant's  criminal  convictions  in  the  United  Kingdom.   On  22nd
    December 2011, the claimant was convicted of theft.   On  20th  January
    2012 he was convicted of criminal damage.  On 8th  March  2012  he  was
    convicted of assaulting a police officer.  On 30th April  2012  he  was
    convicted of criminal damage as well as being  found  in  breach  of  a
    youth rehabilitation order.  On 14th May 2012 he was  found  guilty  of
    fare evasion.  According to the criminal courts, the  claimant  has  an
    assessed date of birth of 1st January 1996.  How this date came  to  be
    chosen is  unclear.   The  claimant  asserted  that  he  had  not  been
    responsible for it.  I am prepared to accept that that may be so.   The
    significance of that date is, however, that in June 2012  the  claimant
    found himself in Cookham  Wood  Young  Offenders'  Institution  (as  to
    which, see below).

29.   There was no independent evidence  regarding  on  what  occasions  the
    claimant pleaded not guilty in respect of these offences.  The claimant
    appeared to assert that he had  pleaded  guilty  to  the  fare  evasion
    charge, but not to the others.  Mr Hadden asked  me  to  conclude  from
    this that the claimant's credibility was further damaged,  in  that  he
    had chosen to deny criminal acts, which had been found  proved  to  the
    criminal standard.  Mr Suterwalla, however, urged me not to  make  much
    of this, since it was common for people to plead not guilty and then be
    convicted.  I do  not  consider  that  I  have  sufficient  information
    regarding the details of the circumstances surrounding the offences  in
    question to place as much weight on these issues  as  Mr  Hadden  would
    wish me to do.  I consider, however, that this aspect of  the  evidence
    does nothing to advance the claimant's case to be treated as a  witness
    of truth in the present proceedings.

30.   Although much of the evidence of Maureen McCamley and Valbina  Mejzini
    concerns the  physical  appearance,  demeanour  and  behaviour  of  the
    claimant, as opposed to the direct issue of  his  credibility,  I  have
    nevertheless had regard to  their  evidence,  both  oral  and  written,
    insofar as it touches on credibility, as well as those  other  matters.
    Ms Mejzini  in  particular  has  had  long-standing  contact  with  the
    claimant and both witnesses have had the opportunity of  assessing  him
    over longer period of times than may be the case  with  social  workers
    undertaking an  age  assessment  exercise.   It  is  plain  from  their
    evidence that both witnesses believe the claimant is telling the  truth
    about his age.  It is also true  that  both  have  formed  independent,
    positive opinions about him.

31.   Whether or not the claimant is in the habit of associating  with  boys
    of an older age than his claimed age was an issue  in  dispute  at  the
    hearing.

32.   I accept Ms McCamley's point that, as with the  claimant,  if  one  is
    placed in accommodation by a  local  authority  with  persons  who  are
    somewhat older than oneself, it is likely that one will socialise  with
    those individuals.  That the claimant did so is not indicative  of  his
    being other than his asserted age.  Likewise,  I  accept  Ms  Mejzini's
    evidence regarding the claimant's demeanour in her  offices,  where  he
    expressed the view that he did  not  wish  to  mix  with  other  asylum
    seekers, preferring to sit on his own.

33.    However,  there  was  considerable  documentary  evidence  from   the
    defendant, to the effect that the claimant socialises with other  young
    persons more than he would have me believe.  On various occasions  when
    visits were made to him in his accommodation, it  was  said  by  others
    that he was out with his friends.  Despite Mr  Suterwalla's  criticisms
    of Mr Obeng's evidence, I accept  the  evidence  regarding  Mr  Obeng's
    visiting the claimant, who was found in the company of persons whom  Mr
    Obeng knew or had good reason to believe were over the age of 18, at  a
    time when, according to the claimant, he would have been  significantly
    younger.
The Cookham Wood incident

34.    In  June  2012  the  claimant  was  held  in  HM   Young   Offenders'
    Institution, Cookham Wood, Kent.  On the weekend of 23rd/24th June  the
    claimant was  present  in  Cedar  House,  which  houses  newly  arrived
    residents and those who are on resettlement.  According to the  witness
    statement of Denise Collins, a senior officer at Cookham Wood, who  was
    the manager of Cedar House at that time, on 23rd June she was  informed
    by one of the residents of Cedar House that the claimant  was  tearful.
    She spoke to the claimant and discovered that he  was  "angry  that  he
    couldn't make a telephone call to his friends".  Ms  Collins  explained
    to me that when young people in the institution wish to make  telephone
    calls, they are required to  provide  certain  information  in  writing
    about the proposed contacts.  The reason is to ensure  the  welfare  of
    the young person, and concerns child protection.

35.   Ms Collins ascertained that the claimant had  had  his  form  returned
    because certain information  relating  to  people  whom  he  wished  to
    contact had not been filled in.  She told the claimant that  he  needed
    to provide the information as a safeguarding  measure  because  he  was
    considered a child in the eyes of the law.  According to Ms Collins, at
    this point the claimant angrily stated "I am not a child" and said that
    he wanted to leave the institution.  He asked to be let into his room.

36.   Ms Collins contacted the duty governor,  Mr  Woodbine,  about  another
    matter  (it  appeared  from  oral  evidence  that  this   concerned   a
    malfunctioning TV).  When  Mr  Woodbine  arrived  at  Cedar  House,  Ms
    Collins informed him what the claimant had said to her.

37.   Ms Collins's statement then described how she and Mr Woodbine  entered
    the claimant's room.  The claimant was lying on his bed but got up  and
    sat on the edge of the bed.  Mr Woodbine asked if he  could  sit  on  a
    chair and the claimant said that he could.  Mr Woodbine then  spoke  to
    the claimant about what the claimant had said to Ms Collins.  She heard
    the claimant tell Mr Woodbine that the  claimant  was  over  19.   When
    asked by Mr Woodbine if he knew exactly how old he  was,  the  claimant
    said that he was not sure, but repeated that he knew he  was  over  19.
    Mr Woodbine then told the claimant that in order to be  transferred  to
    another prison he would need to stop the proceedings he  had  underway,
    contesting his age.  It  was  arranged  for  the  claimant  to  make  a
    telephone call to his solicitor the following week.

38.   Mr Woodbine's written statement describes how he  was  made  aware  by
    senior officer Collins that the claimant was upset and  was  asking  to
    speak to the governor.  This was about "having  phone  numbers  cleared
    and the information he was required to supply".  During his rounds,  Mr
    Woodbine visited Cedar House and he and Ms Collins went to speak to the
    claimant.  When introduced, the claimant sat up  but  remained  on  his
    bed.  Mr Woodbine asked if he could sit on the chair and  the  claimant
    said "yes".

39.   The claimant, according to Mr Woodbine, was  protesting  about  giving
    information in relation to his telephone list.  Mr  Woodbine  explained
    that due to his being a child, he was subject to additional  checks  to
    safeguard his wellbeing.  During the conversation the claimant  "stated
    that he was not a child and was in fact over the age of 19.  I enquired
    with him as to his actual age to which he replied that he did not know,
    but he was  over  19  years.   I  talked  [the  claimant]  through  his
    statement, checking that he understood what it was he had told  me.   I
    explained  to  [the  claimant]  that  he  should  contact   his   legal
    representative as his proclamation would have an impact on  his  status
    within the prison estate.  [The claimant] clearly understood  and  took
    part in the conversation."

40.   On leaving the room, Mr Woodbine instructed Ms  Collins  to  submit  a
    security information report and to inform the custody department  about
    the claimant's claim that he was at least 19 years of age.

41.   Ms Collins's statement concurs  that  at  no  time  did  the  claimant
    indicate  he  had  difficulty  in  understanding  any  aspect  of   the
    conversation.  The statement ends by indicating that "once he had  told
    the governor and myself that he was over 19, he told the other boys  on
    Cedar that he was over 19 too."

42.   In his second witness statement, the claimant has this  to  say  about
    the incident:-

         "2.      When I was detained [in]  Cookham  Wood  Detention  Centre
             (sic) I spoke with a Governor.  He asked me if I had a  family
             in the UK.  I said I did not.  He asked me how old I  was.   I
             told him I was 17 � years old.  He said according to the  Home
             Office you are an adult.   I  told  him  that  my  age  is  in
             dispute.  I told him that according to the Home  Office  I  am
             over 18 years of age.  I did not say that I was an  adult  nor
             that I was lying about my age.  I might have said that  I  had
             been accused of lying about my age.  There was no  interpreter
             present during this conversation.


         3. On 6th July 2012 when I was to be taken from the Refugee Council
             children's section to my  solicitors'  offices  by  a  trainee
             social worker and volunteer at the Refugee Council by the name
             of Sophia I said to her 'I am not a child'.  I  meant  that  I
             was quite capable of travelling across  London.   I  am  17  �
             years old.  However, I don't feel like  a  child.   In  Afghan
             culture a person is considered to be an adult by the time they
             reach 15 years of age. "


43.   In cross-examination on this issue, the claimant  denied  saying  that
    he was over 19 years old and suggested that Mr Woodbine and Ms  Collins
    had "misunderstood".  The claimant could not remember any  conversation
    regarding his access to the telephone.  He said that the pair  of  them
    had come to him asking him questions but he did not know why they  were
    asking the questions.  They had asked him how old he was.  He  did  not
    understand them and they did not bring an  interpreter.   The  claimant
    could offer no explanation as to why Mr Woodbine and Ms  Collins  would
    have made up their stories.  When it was put to him that he was  lying,
    the clamant replied "what is the truth?"

44.   In oral evidence, Mr Woodbine explained procedures  and  processes  at
    Cookham Wood,  and  Cedar  House  in  particular.   He  said  that  the
    committal warrant  in  respect  of  the  claimant  had  designated  the
    claimant as a child, which informed the way in which the  claimant  was
    treated at the institution.  Mr Woodbine confirmed that Ms Collins  had
    told him about the problems regarding the list of  telephone  contacts.
    When Mr Woodbine and Ms Collins went into the claimant's room,  he  was
    introduced and the claimant sat up on the bed with  his  left  shoulder
    against the wall.  The claimant told Mr Woodbine that he  was  19.   Mr
    Woodbine "kept checking", and the claimant said that he was at least 19
    but could not be sure of his exact age.  Once again, the claimant  said
    that he was over 19.  The conversation was not  a  short  one.   At  no
    point, according to Mr Woodbine, did the claimant say he was 17 � years
    old.

45.   Mr Woodbine  stated  that  the  claimant  had  had  no  difficulty  in
    communicating, even though English was not  his  first  language.   The
    claimant could hold a conversation and answer questions  and  "put  his
    points across".  At any point five to six percent of those  in  Cookham
    Wood were foreign nationals and Mr Woodbine said that he was very aware
    of the importance of enabling people to be understood.

46.   As the claimant spoke to Mr Woodbine, the former  was  looking  at  Mr
    Woodbine and "fiddling with the toe end of his sock, as I recall".  The
    claimant's demeanour was good, with  good  eye  contact,  although  the
    claimant was clearly upset.  He was nevertheless "polite and engaging".
     By the end of the conversation, Mr Woodbine regarded the  claimant  as
    being "much more upbeat".

47.   A good deal of Mr  Suterwalla's  cross-examination  concerned  whether
    Cookham Wood processes such  as  ACCT  assessments  ("Assessment  Care,
    Custody and Teamwork") indicated that  the  claimant  was  regarded  as
    especially vulnerable.  For example, at K22 there was a  note  of  14th
    June describing the claimant as having been "very  agitated"  (although
    the same note records him as being willing to "open up  and  laugh  and
    joke with officers he likes" and as "now beginning to engage  with  the
    other boys").

48.   It was plain from Mr Woodbine's answers that, despite these  processes
    and procedures, he did not regard the claimant  as  being  particularly
    vulnerable and, in particular, it was plain that Mr  Woodbine  did  not
    regard them as having had any material  effect  upon  his  conversation
    with the claimant in his room on 23rd June.

49.   Regarding events leading to that conversation, Mr Woodbine  said  that
    Ms Collins had recorded the claimant having said to  her  that  he  was
    "not a child".  Mr Woodbine stated that lots of young people  said  the
    same; they did not like to be called children.  He  accepted  that  she
    might on the telephone have said that the claimant complained of  being
    "treated like a child".

50.   Mr Woodbine made  a  point  during  his  weekend  deputising  for  the
    governor of seeing every single person in the establishment.   Although
    he was  aware  of  the  age  assessment  proceedings  relating  to  the
    claimant, the warrant of committal had  required  the  claimant  to  be
    treated as a child.

51.   Mr Woodbine said that he recalled  the  claimant  as  saying  that  he
    wanted to be transferred to another, adult establishment.  It  was  put
    to him that it was strange that this was in neither person's statement.
     He replied that the incident took place several weeks ago.   Once  the
    claimant had disclosed that he  was  an  adult,  this  raised  concerns
    regarding the welfare of other children in the establishment.

52.   Mr Woodbine took what the claimant had said about  being  over  19  as
    being "honest and truthful".  The conversation had lasted five  to  ten
    minutes.  He had checked what the claimant had been saying.   Regarding
    the claimant's version of events, Mr Woodbine said it was not  possible
    that there had been a  misunderstanding.   He  had  repeated  what  the
    claimant had said to him about being  over  19  and  the  claimant  had
    confirmed that statement.

53.   Mr Woodbine did  not  accept  that  there  had  been  a  need  for  an
    interpreter.  He  was  well  used  to  judging  if  someone  understood
    sufficiently in  order  to  establish  whether  a  person  required  an
    interpreter.   He  used  open-ended  questions  in   order   to   check
    comprehension.  The claimant was wrong to say that Mr  Woodbine  had  a
    piece of paper with him.  He did not; and it was not really a  question
    of there being a misunderstanding.

54.    In  re-examination,  Mr  Woodbine  said  that  the  outcome  of   the
    conversation had been immaterial to him.  He had no "agenda".

55.   In oral evidence, Denise Collins said that she had seen  the  claimant
    every day whilst she had been on duty and had spoken to him daily.  The
    claimant had never asked  her  for  an  interpreter.   He  appeared  to
    understand and she understood what he wanted.  He had  been  helped  by
    the other boys to fill out  his  menu  requirements.   Although  "quite
    insular", the claimant had dined out of his room and had  attended  the
    gymnasium, where he had been "told off for not changing into his  kit".
    There had been no animosity that Ms Collins had  observed  between  the
    claimant and the other boys; the claimant was "quite a  likeable  young
    man".

56.   Ms Collins herself had considered that  the  claimant  was  definitely
    over 18, judging by his appearance, temperament (not  being  excitable)
    and acting  older.   Ms  Collins  reiterated  the  information  in  her
    statement regarding the conversation that the claimant had had with  Mr
    Woodbine.  During the conversation, the claimant was  not  abashed  and
    had made eye contact with Mr Woodbine.  Ms Collins had been standing by
    the door.  She thought the  conversation  had  lasted  ten  to  fifteen
    minutes.

57.   She was asked about her statement in which she said that the  claimant
    had told the other boys about his age.  She said that  she  had  formed
    the impression that the claimant was "quite relieved".  He was seen  by
    her to be joking and laughing with the other boys and they were calling
    him "uncle".  She did not, however, specifically hear the claimant  say
    to them that he was over 19.

58.   In cross-examination, asked to  give  an  age  for  the  claimant,  Ms
    Collins said that she thought he  was  over  25.   His  hair  had  been
    shaved, last thing while he had been  in  the  institution.   She  also
    formed her impression from the way he conducted himself with the  other
    boys.  He was mature and did not "bash things around", nor was he prone
    to "mucking around".  Ms Collins indicated that  it  was  a  relatively
    easy process to obtain an interpreter for the residents at Cedar  House
    if this were necessary.  She did not regard his  frustration  regarding
    the use of the telephone as indicating immaturity.   The  claimant  had
    said "I am not a  child"  with  some  force  and  quite  clearly.   She
    regarded him specifically as referring to his age.

59.   When the claimant's account was put to Ms Collins, she  said  that  it
    was not possible that the conversation had involved the claimant saying
    that the Home Office considered him to be over 18.  There had  been  no
    misunderstanding.  The claimant had said that he was over  19  although
    he did not know his exact age.  The claimant had definitely not been on
    the ACCT system when the conversation had occurred.  Many  arrivals  go
    on this programme for a short period of time after they come to Cookham
    Wood.  Ms Collins accepted that she had not actually heard the claimant
    say to other boys that he was over 19.

60.   In re-examination, Ms Collins was adamant that the claimant had  never
    said that he was 17 � during the conversation with Mr Woodbine.

61.   As I have already indicated, it emerged during the  oral  evidence  of
    Mr Woodbine and Ms Collins that two records were apparently made of the
    conversation, at the time.  Pursuant to  the  directions  I  gave,  the
    governor has served an extract from  the  security  information  report
    compiled at 16.45 hours on 23rd June 2012 by Ms Collins.  It  reads  as
    follows:-

         "AT APPROXIMATELY 16.25 HRS ON 23.06.12, DURING A CONVERSATION WITH
         GOVERNOR WOODBINE, [THE CLAIMANT] DISCLOSED THAT HE WAS OLDER  THAN
         19 YEARS OF AGE.  HE ALSO STATED THAT ALTHOUGH HE KNOWS HE IS OLDER
         THAN 19 HE ISN'T SURE EXACTLY HOW OLD HE IS."

62.   Also served was this extract from the  Cedar  House  observation  log,
    compiled at 6.40 hours on 23rd June 2012:-

         "During a conversation with Gov. Woodbine, [the claimant] disclosed
         that he was older than 19 years old (sic).  He is to stay on  Cedar
         House until otherwise directed.  [signature of Denise Collins]"

63.   Despite his considerable best efforts, Mr Suterwalla made no  material
    inroads whatsoever into the  evidence  of  either  Mr  Woodbine  or  Ms
    Collins.  Both of  them  are,  I  find,  entirely  credible  witnesses.
    Neither of them had any personal or professional reason to persuade the
    claimant to make  admissions  about  his  true  age.   Both  were  well
    disposed towards the claimant;  especially  Ms  Collins,  who  had  had
    regular, daily contact with him, and who (it was clear)  plainly  liked
    the claimant on a personal basis. Their evidence is corroborated by the
    contemporaneous written records  mentioned  in  paragraphs  61  and  62
    above.

64.   By contrast, the claimant's evidence on the  Cookham  Wood  issue  was
    thoroughly unsatisfactory.  He affected not to remember the reason  for
    the conversation and sought to portray it as having been instigated  by
    Mr Woodbine and/or Ms Collins.  I  have  no  hesitation  in  preferring
    their evidence to that of the  claimant.   This  is  having  given  due
    allowance to the position of the claimant, in particular as regards the
    psychological problems described by Dr Freedman. I accept the  evidence
    of Mr Woodbine and Ms  Collins  regarding  the  claimant's  ability  to
    understand and be understood during the conversation. Their  experience
    in dealing with foreign national residents would have alerted  them  to
    any difficulties in this  regard.  The  claimant's  attempt  to  invoke
    language difficulties is, I find, without merit.

65.   The  Cookham  Wood  incident  also  casts  revealing  light  on  other
    contentious evidential aspects of this case.  It supports the  evidence
    of the defendant to the effect that, when  he  thinks  he  is  able  to
    conduct himself in a way that will not have an adverse effect upon  his
    age assessment case, the claimant exhibits  behaviour  quite  different
    from that  which  he  chooses  to  employ  whenever  he  thinks  he  is
    interacting with persons concerned  with  the  current  age  assessment
    proceedings.

66.   Thus, in reality, the claimant (whilst  not  particularly  gregarious)
    is much more of a social  animal  than  he  pretends.   Furthermore,  I
    accept the defendant's evidence that,  where  the  opportunity  arises,
    this socialising  tends  to  involve  those  who  are  older  than  the
    claimant's claimed age and who are, in fact, at or around  the  age  at
    which the defendant  has  assessed  him.   This  is  supported  by  the
    observations of Ms Collins, that the claimant behaved in a more  mature
    fashion than that of persons under the age of 18.

67.   I find that what happened at Cookham Wood on 23rd June 2012  was  that
    the claimant did, indeed,  become  frustrated  at  the  fact  that  his
    claimed age  had  caused  or  contributed  to  his  being  in  a  young
    offenders' institution, categorised as  a  child,  and  that  this  was
    having an adverse impact on his ability  to  communicate  by  telephone
    with his friends.  What he said to Mr Woodbine in the  presence  of  Ms
    Collins about being over 19 was, I find, the truth.   The  relief  that
    was occasioned by this confession is noted in the evidence of  both  Mr
    Woodbine and Ms Collins.  Indeed, Ms  Collins's  description  of  other
    detainees laughing with the claimant and calling him  "uncle"  has  the
    entire ring of truth about it.   The  fact  that,  at  some  subsequent
    point, the claimant has had second thoughts about the respective merits
    and disadvantages of being found to have lied about his  age  does  not
    affect these findings, except  further  to  underscore  the  claimant's
    capacity for dishonesty.

68.   In so finding,  I  have  very  much  borne  in  mind  Mr  Suterwalla's
    submission that, were I not to accept the claimant's version of  events
    regarding the Cookham Wood incident, I should find that he lied  to  Mr
    Woodbine and Ms  Collins,  in  a  misguided  attempt  to  overcome  the
    restrictions regarding telephone usage.  Mr Suterwalla's submission was
    to the effect that, if the claimant did this, it was a further sign  of
    his immaturity.

69.   I do not accept that alternative submission.  Both Mr Woodbine and  Ms
    Collins, as experienced professionals dealing  with  young  people  who
    fall to be treated as vulnerable, whether as to age,  incarceration  or
    psychological difficulties (or all three) were of  the  view  that  the
    claimant had told them the truth.  They observed his behaviour after he
    had told them that truth, which  was  indicative  of  a  burden  lifted
    rather than anything else (such as hoped for short term gain).


Age assessment

70.   Mrs Brouf's evidence concerned her part in the  first  age  assessment
    (2008).  Whilst that assessment, as such, is no longer relied  upon,  I
    agree with Mr Hadden that evidence contained in it regarding  what  was
    observed at the time can have a part (albeit modest)  to  play  in  the
    present proceedings.  The 2008 assessment noted  generally  distributed
    facial hair.  The claimant was  recorded  as  saying  that  he  started
    shaving only upon his arrival in the UK and that  he  had  shaved  only
    twice  since  then.   In  view  of  my  assessment  of  the  claimant's
    credibility, I consider there to be no reason whatsoever to accept  his
    evidence regarding when he started shaving.

71.   Mrs Brouf noted "a few grey hairs on  his  head".   She  observed  the
    same kind of grey hairs on the claimant's head at the  hearing.   I  do
    not regard this as being of any particular significance.  So far as the
    claimant's demeanour at  the  age  assessment  was  concerned,  I  have
    already noted what was recorded in relation to the time  at  which  his
    mother allegedly told him he was 13 years old.  Other  than  that,  the
    assessment records  the  claimant  speaking  in  low  tones  and  being
    requested to speak up on numerous occasions.  That was consistent  with
    what I saw at the hearing.  The assessment described  the  claimant  as
    "not completely psychologically focused".  To an extent,  that  may  be
    true.  However, given the credibility problems,  I  consider  that  the
    dominant cause of the claimant's behaviour in this and  other  contexts
    (including the hearing in July  2012)  was  his  dishonest  attempt  to
    portray himself as younger than he really is, coupled with  his  belief
    that this behaviour might minimise the chance of him being "caught out"
    as to his account of events prior to arriving in  the  United  Kingdom.
    In short, and although I accept Mr Suterwalla's criticisms  of  aspects
    of this age assessment (such as the absence of notes), those criticisms
    do not advance the claimant's case or damage that of the defendant.

72.   Like Mrs Brouf, Mrs Nyaba is one of the  defendant's  social  workers.
    She carried out a paper review of the  claimant's  case  in  May  2011.
    Much of her evidence involved a disagreement with the  evidence  of  Ms
    Mezzini as to the significance of  the  claimant's  past  behaviour  in
    storming out of meetings, his inability to manage  his  money  and  his
    frequent demands to the defendant for more money.  For the claimant, it
    is submitted that this behaviour was indicative  of  immaturity,  which
    pointed to his being the  age  he  said  he  was.   I  agree  with  the
    defendant that this by no  means  follows  and  that  there  are  other
    equally possible reasons for such behaviour.  The same is true  of  the
    evidence of Mr Jakes as to whether the  claimant  previously  kept  his
    room clean.

73.   Mrs Salimi was involved in the second age assessment.  I  accept  some
    of the criticisms levelled at Mrs Salimi's evidence by  Mr  Suterwalla.
    These include the absence of notes and  problems  regarding  finalising
    the age assessment.  Mrs Salimi  mounted  a  spirited  and,  at  times,
    impassioned  defence  of  her  work,  under  cross-examination  by   Mr
    Suterwalla.  Whilst I acknowledge her  professionalism,  at  times  her
    evidence was hard to follow and appeared to lack objectivity.   It  is,
    however, plain that, from a professional standpoint, she  regarded  the
    claimant's physical appearance as not being compatible with his claimed
    age but, rather, with someone materially older.   She  also  considered
    the claimant to be "somewhat evasive".  Were that evidence to stand  on
    its own, I might be circumspect in according  it  weight.   As  it  is,
    however, Mrs Salimi's description of the  way  in  which  the  claimant
    conducted himself at the second age assessment fits perfectly  with  my
    findings as to his credibility.

74.   Megan Clement, team leader and social worker for  the  defendant,  had
    occasion to check in November 2009 if  the  claimant  was  entitled  to
    benefits.  There was a dispute between her and Ms McCamley as  to  what
    Ms Clement did or did not say  to  Ms  McCamley  on  the  telephone  in
    January 2010.  Ms McCamley  noted  Ms  Clement  as  agreeing  that  the
    claimant "looked young and that he might have  learning  difficulties".
    She also said that the claimant was thought by her  to  be  "vulnerable
    and would be referred to mental health services".  The  fact  that  the
    defendant took the view that the claimant, despite  being  assessed  as
    born on 1st January 1992 nevertheless needed particular assistance  for
    what might have been thought to be psychological difficulties is not in
    issue in these proceedings.  On the contrary, the defendant's  evidence
    indicates that, whilst not accepting that the claimant is as  young  as
    he said, the choice of 1st January 1992 was made with an eye to  giving
    the claimant an age which would enable the  defendant  to  provide  the
    kind of services that were considered  to  be  appropriate,  given  his
    difficulties.  Mr Suterwalla took issue  with  this  as  a  reason  for
    alighting upon 1st January 1992.  I shall deal with that  shortly.   So
    far as concerns the factual dispute as to  whether  Ms  Clement  agreed
    that the claimant looked young, I have concluded that, on balance, this
    is likely to be what she said to Ms McCamley.  However,  considered  in
    the round with all the other evidence, in particular that  relating  to
    the Cookham Wood incident, I do not regard this as being a matter  that
    has any material significance in my findings regarding  the  claimant's
    age.

75.   Mr Obeng's relationship with the claimant has been  somewhat  fraught,
    since Mr Obeng appears to have  had  responsibility  for  dealing  with
    what, at  one  stage,  were  the  claimant's  frequent  visits  to  the
    defendant's offices to  demand  more  money.   I  also  agree  with  Mr
    Suterwalla that aspects of Mr Obeng's evidence were unsatisfactory  and
    that  he  was,  on  occasions,  prone  to  vagueness  and  reliance  on
    generalisations.  That said, looking at matters in the round  with  the
    other evidence, I consider that Mr Obeng's evidence casts further light
    upon the nature of the claimant's behaviour at times when  he  did  not
    feel the age assessment "spotlight" to be directed at him.


Conclusions

76.   In the light of the evidence before me, I find that  the  claimant  is
    not a witness of  truth.   None  of  the  criticisms  advanced  of  the
    defendant's witnesses, or the genuinely held views of Ms  McCamley  and
    Ms Mejzini, come  anywhere  near  counteracting  the  effects  of  that
    adverse credibility finding.  In particular, the evidence regarding the
    Cookham Wood incident is, I find, of great significance and I give that
    evidence very substantial weight.    Like Mr Woodbine and Ms Collins, I
    consider that the claimant was telling the  truth  when  he  told  them
    that, although he did not know his exact age, he was over 19  years  of
    age as at June 2012.

77.   The defendant's assessment of the claimant, as  having  been  born  on
    1st January 1992, would put him as 20 years of age  as  at  June  2012.
    Mr Suterwalla criticised the rationale for the  defendant's  choice  of
    1st January 1992.  As I have indicated, the evidence suggests that this
    date was chosen with an eye on the kind of support which the  defendant
    thought the claimant needed at  the  relevant  time.   Given  that  age
    assessment is not an exact science, the defendant's approach  does  not
    strike me as perverse but, rather, as pragmatic and benign.

78.   Leaving aside periods of less than a year, the youngest that a  person
    who says they are "over 19" can be is,  of  course,  20.   In  all  the
    circumstances, and following the  approach  described  in  paragraph  7
    above, that seems  to  me  to  be  the  most  appropriate  choice.   So
    compelling is the evidence on which the defendant relies that there  is
    no reasonable likelihood the claimant was born, as he  asserts,  on  or
    around 1st January 1995.

79.   I will therefore make a declaration that the claimant's date of  birth
    is 1st January 1992.  I will hear Counsel if they cannot agree the form
    of that order or the terms of any further order sought,  in  particular
    on the issue of costs.
