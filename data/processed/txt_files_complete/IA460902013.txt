Representation:

For the appellant: Ms A Holmes a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent: the respondent did not appear and was not represented

                      NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department. I will
    refer to her as the Secretary of State. The respondent is a citizen  of
    Brazil who was born on 10 September 1980. I will refer to  her  as  the
    claimant. The Secretary of State has been given  permission  to  appeal
    the determination of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Wyman who dismissed  the
    claimant's appeal under the Immigration Rules but allowed it on Article
    8 human rights grounds against the Secretary of State's decision of  26
    October 2013 to refuse to vary  her  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom and to remove her by way of directions under section 47 of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. Prior to the hearing before me the Tribunal received an email from  the
    claimant indicating that she wished to withdraw her  appeal  and  leave
    the UK at the end of March 2014. The application was  refused  and  she
    was informed that the hearing would have to proceed because  there  was
    an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the  First-
    Tier Tribunal Judge to allow her appeal on human rights grounds. At the
    hearing I informed Ms Holmes of this and  adjourned  for  her  to  make
    enquiries. On her return she informed me  that  the  claimant  went  to
    Lunar House on 24 March 2014 and showed an airline ticket  to  Germany,
    flight number EZY 5343, departing on 31 March 2014 to Germany. She  was
    given removal directions in form IS96 and signed a  form  IS101  which,
    although I have not seen it, I am told indicates that she  intended  to
    make a voluntary departure from the UK. Ms Holmes informed me that,  as
    far as the Secretary of State was aware, the claimant made a  voluntary
    departure from the UK on 31 March 2014.

 3. In these circumstances the appeal which was  brought  by  the  claimant
    under section 82 (1) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 ("the 2002 Act") must be treated as abandoned by reason of section
    104(4) of the 2002 Act. Under the provisions of paragraph  17A  of  The
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 I treat  the  claimant's
    appeal as abandoned. Notice of  abandonment  should  be  given  to  all
    parties in accordance with the Rules.
