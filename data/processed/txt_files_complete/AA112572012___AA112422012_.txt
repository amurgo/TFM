Representation:

For the Appellant:     Yumann Chung, instructed by the Treasury Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Stephen F Winter, instructed by Neil Barnes,
solicitor


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Secretary of State, the respondent  below,  appeals  with  permission
   against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  claimants'
   appeals against her refusal to grant them  refugee  status,  humanitarian
   protection or other human rights leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

2. The claimants are citizens  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  whose
   account was found credible, and who came to the United  Kingdom  together
   in July 2011, with the help of 'snakehead' people traffickers.  They  are
   both from Jin Hua  City  in  Zhe  Jiang  Province.   They  are  partners,
   although unmarried, and have had twin girl children since coming  to  the
   United Kingdom.

3. At the First-tier Tribunal they did not rely on  their  family  situation
   as  a  risk  factor  because,  as  set  out  in  paragraph  33   of   the
   determination, they recognised that they would be unlikely to succeed  on
   that basis in the light of the Upper Tribunal's country  guidance  in  AX
   (family planning scheme) China CG [2012] UKUT 97 (IAC), which remains the
   most recent guidance on the Chinese family planning scheme.

The factual matrix

4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Scobbie accepted  the  claimants'  accounts  of
   their history in China, where they lived together.   The  first  claimant
   worked away from home in an electronics factory, and the  second  claimed
   worked in an internet cafï¿½.  Their parents and other relatives had helped
   them buy their house in Jin Hua, which was in the first claimant's  name.
   The Chinese government proposed to demolish a number of local houses  and
   pay what the residents regarded as  inadequate  compensation;  complaints
   through official  channels  failed  and  when  the  authorities  came  to
   demolish the houses, there was a demonstration which became a  fight,  in
   the course of which these claimants were arrested and taken to the police
   station, where they were questioned to  determine  the  identity  of  the
   ringleader.  They were badly treated during repeated questioning.

5. They were then sentenced to time at a labour education  camp  (lao  gai),
   the first claimant for 18 months and the second claimant, because of  her
   computer assistance to the protests, for two  years.    The  labour  camp
   separated men and women, though they were in the same camp.  They  worked
   for 12 hours a day in poor conditions. Both the claimants became ill,  at
   exactly the same time, and paid money to the camp authorities for medical
   leave to receive treatment.   Bribery  may  have  been  involved  or  the
   payments may have been  official.   That  remains  unclear.   The  second
   claimant was really ill and went to hospital for a week of her  allocated
   month for medical treatment.  She felt so ill that, with  their  parents'
   help, the couple decided that she could not return to the camp  and  that
   both of them would run away.  At the end of June 2011, having made a down
   payment to snakehead people traffickers, the claimants left their village
   and travelled to Shanghai, then Moscow, and finally to the United Kingdom
   where they arrived a week later.

6. The snakehead traffickers detained the claimants in the  United  Kingdom,
   forcing them to sell DVDs, probably in Glasgow.  Eventually, the  balance
   of the trafficking fee was paid and in March  2012  they  were  released,
   claiming asylum promptly thereafter.  The  second  claimant  was  heavily
   pregnant then, and the twins were born in May 2012.   The  basis  of  the
   asylum claim was that they feared being punished for failing to  complete
   their sentences at the labour camp.  The birth of their daughters is  not
   relied upon: the First-tier Tribunal Judge found, obiter, that  the  most
   likely outcome was that an SUC would be imposed, which could be paid over
   a period of time, and that the claimants  had  a  supportive  family  who
   would assist them.   They and the  children  would  suffer  no  long-term
   disadvantage.

The grounds of appeal

7. The Secretary of State challenged that decision, on  two  grounds,  first
   that at paragraph 40 the First-tier Tribunal failed adequately to  engage
   with the background information available to  him  when  considering  the
   sentences passed on the claimants, failing to give adequate  reasons  for
   'deviating from this factual evidence by  basing  his  findings  on  mere
   assumptions'.  Secondly, she argued that in expressing  his  reservations
   at paragraph 42, the First-tier Tribunal Judge  had  misdirected  himself
   and that it was not open to him to find them  credible  for  the  reasons
   given.

Grant of permission to appeal

8. Designated Judge Woodcraft granted permission on the basis  that  it  was
   arguable that the judge had not assessed the claimants' case against  the
   background evidence; his reference to the material, at  paragraph  32  of
   the determination, was somewhat brief;  he had arguably failed to explain
   how an acceptance of credibility  alone  resolved  the  issues  in  their
   favour, or adequately to consider the material.

Rule 24 Reply

9. On 27 February 2013, Neil Barnes solicitor,  acting  for  the  claimants,
   filed a Rule 24 Reply combined with a skeleton argument.  He  noted  that
   the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal did not actually challenge the
   decision in the First-tier Tribunal  determination  and  argued  that  no
   error of law  had  been  identified.    He  argued  that  the  background
   information relied upon post-dated the claimants' detention in China  and
   that at paragraphs 7 and 32, the judge had made  it  clear  that  he  had
   taken into account the country evidence before him.    He relied  on  the
   Secretary of State's OGN (paragraphs 3.12.1 - 3.12.4) and her Country  of
   Origin Report at paragraphs 14.10-14.18 which supported the  observations
   at paragraph 40 of the determination.

10.  In  addition,  he  argued  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  quoted
   selectively  from  the  determination  and  that  the   effect   was   to
   misrepresent  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  reasoning,  which   was
   adequate to support the conclusions reached.

11. If the decision were to be set  aside,  with  the  positive  credibility
   findings preserved, he set out the relevant authorities which would  have
   to be taken into account.   In the light of the country information, they
   would be perceived to have an oppositionist political opinion  and  would
   be at risk on return.

12. That was the basis on which these appeals came before us.





The hearing

13. At the beginning of the hearing, we indicated that  we  considered  that
   the grounds of appeal misstated the conclusions reached by the First-tier
   Tribunal Judge.  The material  paragraph  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
   grounds of appeal reads thus:

           "In addition, it is  respectfully  submitted  that  despite  his
           reservations,  highlighted  at  paragraph   42   regarding   the
           appellants contact prior to  claiming  asylum  as  well  as  the
           wanted notice, he finds the appellants to  be  credible  because
           they are able  to  corroborate  each  other's  account.   It  is
           respectfully submitted that he has failed to give  reasons  from
           deviating from background information in spite of stating 'I  am
           not satisfied that the appellants are telling the  truth'  (para
           42) and 'Of course, the fact  that  they  have  exactly  similar
           accounts does not mean that the accounts are true.   They  could
           have worked very hard to make up a story and have managed to get
           it right when it is appropriate to do so' (para 38)."

14. What the  First-tier Tribunal Judge said, in context, was as follows:

           "38.  ...The fact that the appellants have accounts which  stand
           up to cross-examination as being exactly the same  is  something
           which I have not met very often.  Of course, the fact that  they
           have exactly similar accounts, does not mean that  the  accounts
           are true.  They could have worked very hard to make up  a  story
           and managed to get it right when it is  appropriate  to  do  so.
           However, the major problem I have with any contrary argument  is
           that they both managed to say things when asked questions by the
           respondent's representative which they may well not have had  an
           opportunity to get their stories correct if they were  preparing
           a lie.  I believe that  some  of  the  questions  asked  by  the
           respondent's representative were questions which  would  not  be
           easily anticipated.  ...

           42.   ...With regard to the other matters in this case I  had  a
           few concerns.  It seemed to me that the appellants coming to the
           United  Kingdom  and  claiming  to  be  under  the  control   of
           snakeheads for some considerable time and not knowing where they
           were before claiming asylum was a little difficult. I make  this
           point especially as  the  appellants  claimed  asylum  when  the
           second appellant had discovered she was pregnant. Further, I was
           not at all impressed by the copy wanted notice sent.   The  fact
           that it contained a phrase concerning his accent seems to me  to
           be a response to the suggestion that he does not come  from  the
           Province he claims.  I cannot se any reason why  this  would  be
           put on the wanted notice.  I am not  absolutely  satisfied  that
           the appellants are telling the truth but I am aware  that  there
           is a low standard of proof in these cases.  I was  impressed  by
           the fact that their accounts were almost  exactly  similar  even
           under questioning which could not have been anticipated. I  also
           accepted that their responses to the various credibility  issues
           were perfectly plausible. "

                                                            [Emphasis added]

15. We observed to the respondent's Counsel that in both  those  paragraphs,
   the full context of the phrases  criticised  in  the  grounds  of  appeal
   seemed to us to be adequate to support  his  conclusions.   Further,  the
   assertion that the First-tier Tribunal Judge said at paragraph 42 that he
   was 'not satisfied that the appellants are telling the truth' was not  an
   accurate quotation:  he said he was 'not absolutely satisfied'  and  then
   referred to the lower standard of proof, which is correct.  We find  that
   the First-tier Tribunal Judge was entitled to reach  the  conclusions  on
   credibility which he did,  for  the  reasons  given,  which  were  clear,
   cogent, and adequate.   There  was  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
   determination.

16. Ms Chung for the appellant indicated that the Secretary of  State  would
   grant asylum to these appellants.

Conclusions:
The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.  The decision is upheld.

Consequential Directions
Forthwith on receipt  of  this  decision  the  respondent  shall  grant  the
appellants leave to remain for such period as is necessary  to  give  effect
to this determination.
