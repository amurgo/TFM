               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr  A  Joseph,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  Broudie
                    Jackson and Canter Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                                  DECISION

 1. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Richards, representing  the  Secretary
    of State, made the following acknowledgment.


 2. With specific reference to the fourth of  the  grounds  of  appeal,  Mr
    Richards accepted that the Appellant's claim that he is a Christian was
    not challenged at any stage -  during  the  asylum  interview,  in  the
    refusal letter, at the first instance hearing or in  the  determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal. This, Mr Richards stated, was confirmed  by
    the presenting officer's note  of  the  first  instance  hearing.   The
    Tribunal essentially found that the Appellant is at risk of persecution
    on account of his religion.  Mr Richards further acknowledged  that  if
    the fourth of the Secretary of State's grounds  of  appeal  fails,  the
    other asserted errors of law, even if established, could not amount  to
    material defects.


 3. Mr Richards' approach to the  appeal  is,  in  my  judgement,  entirely
    proper.  For the reasons summarised above, the fourth of the  Secretary
    of State's grounds of appeal, which challenges, root  and  branch,  the
    Judge's finding that  the  Appellant  is  a  Christian,  is  manifestly
    unsustainable.  This goes to the heart of the  case,  with  the  result
    that the other grounds of appeal, even  if  made  out  individually  or
    collectively, could not alter the appropriate outcome.   In the  event,
    neither representative dilated on any of the  other  three  grounds  of
    appeal.


DECISION

 4. The appeal is dismissed  and  the  decision  of  the  FtT  is  affirmed
    accordingly.
