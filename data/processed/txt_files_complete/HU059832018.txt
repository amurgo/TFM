Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Shah from First Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Tully promulgated on 27 September 2018, which  dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal on all grounds.

Background

 3. The Appellant was born on 3 April 1973 and is a national of Pakistan.

 4. On 10 November 2016 the Appellant applied for ILR on  the  bass  of  10
    years long residence.

 5. On 14 February 2018 the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. The refusal letter was on the basis of  paragraph  3222(5)
    of  the  Rules  because  it  was  asserted  there  was  a   significant
    discrepancy between the income declared  for  the  purpose  of  Tier  1
    applications made in 2011 and 2013 and the income declared to HMRC.

 6. Grounds of appeal were lodged against the Judge's decision arguing that
    paragraph 322(5) should not have  been  relied  on  as  the  Appellants
    conduct was not such as to engage the provision relying on  failure  to
    follow the Respondents own Guidance; the Judge failed to give  adequate
    reasons for rejecting the Appellants innocent  explanation;  failed  to
    take into account the best interests of the Appellants child

 7.  On 31 December 2018 Resident Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Zucker gave permission to appeal in respect only  of  the  ground  that
    relying  on  paragraph   322(5)   was   inappropriate   so   that   the
    proportionality assessment was flawed.

 8. At the hearing I heard submissions  from  Mr  Shah  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that:

      a) He relied on his skeleton argument.

      b) The Judge failed to strike a fair balance  between  the  Appellants
         behaviour and the requirements of Article 8.

      c) The Judge  did  not  accept  the  Appellants  explanation  for  the
         underreporting of  his  income  but  her  concerns  were  based  on
         speculation.

      d) There was no incentive for the Appellant to lie about his income he
         was just digging a hole for himself.

      e) HMRC did not prosecute.

      f) The Article 8 was 'superficial and cursory' and  inpatriate  weight
         was given to the finding that the Appellant failed under  paragraph
         322(5).

      g) He made a mistake and he rectified it.

 9. On behalf of the Respondent Mr Bates submitted that :

      a)  Although  the  Judge's  decision  pre  dated  Khan  she  in   fact
         anticipated in in how she assessed the evidence taking into account
         each and every relevant factor set out n Kahn.

      b) However while the Judge did  not  accept  that  the  Appellant  had
         provided an innocent explanation for the discrepancies in issue she
         nevertheless went on to consider the third stage of the process and
         found that the Respondent had met the evidential burden that was on
         them.

      c) All of the findings were open to the Judge and well reasoned.

      d)  This was simply a disagreement with findings  reasonably  open  to
         the Judge.

      e) In relation to proportionality in the light of KO  [2018]  UKSC  53
         having failed to meet the Suitability Requirements of the Rules the
         starting point was the family returned to Pakistan.

      f) The Judge then considered all  the  other  factors  and  gave  them
         appropriate weight.

      g) This was a private life appeal  only  and  the  children  were  not
         qualifying children as they were not British and had  not  been  in
         the UK for over 7 years. There were no compelling features and they
         could return together.

10. In reply Mr Shah on behalf of the Appellant  submitted  there  was  too
    much emphasis on his being educated  and  trying  to  suggest  that  an
    educated man would not make such mistakes.

The Law

11.  Errors  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow  binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational  conclusions  on  facts  or  evaluation  or  giving
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

12. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail  to
    deal with every factual issue  under  argument.  Disagreement  with  an
    Immigrations Judge's factual conclusions, his appraisal of the evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law. Unless an Immigration  Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have  taken  no  account  of  evidence  that  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.

13. As to the duty to give reasons I take into account what was said by the
    Court of Appeal in MD (Turkey) [2017] EWCA Civ 1958 at paragraph 26:

         "The duty to give reasons requires that  reasons  must  be  proper,
         intelligible and adequate:  see the classic authority of this court
         in Re Poyser and Mills' Arbitration [1964]  2  QB  467.   The  only
         dispute in the present case relates to the last of those  elements,
         that is the adequacy of the  reasons  given  by  the  FtT  for  its
         decision allowing the  appellant's  appeal.   It  is  important  to
         appreciate that adequacy in this context is precisely that, no more
         and no less.  It is not a counsel of perfection.  Still less should
         it provide an opportunity to undertake a qualitative assessment  of
         the reasons to see if they are wanting, perhaps even surprising, on
         their merits.  The purpose of the duty to give reasons is, in part,
         to enable the losing party to know why she has lost.  It is also to
         enable an appellate court or tribunal to see what the  reasons  for
         the decision are so that they can be examined in case some error of
         approach has been committed."

Finding on Material Error

14. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law. This was an extremely detailed
    and carefully reasoned decision that anticipates the guidance given  by
    the UT in Khan and examined in detail the  Appellants  account  of  how
    this discrepancy arose.  I find that the grounds are  no  more  than  a
    disagreement with a decision that was open to the Judge on the findings
    she made.

15. I accept that Mr Shah did not  draft  the  grounds  of  appeal  but  he
    endorsed them in his skeleton argument. As I pointed out to Mr Shah  in
    suggesting that the decision maker failed to take  into  account  their
    own Guidance and therefore the decision to invoke paragraph 322 (5) was
    flawed counsel Mr Ahmed relied on the wrong guidance.  He  referred  to
    the Guidance on  the  General  Grounds  for  Refusal  rather  than  the
    specific guidance that related to Tier 1 applications where there is an
    allegation of a discrepancy between income claimed for Tier 1  purposes
    and that claimed with HMRC PS OPI 83 of 2015. This  Guidance  addresses
    the use of paragraph 322(5) but the matter was put beyond  doubt  in  R
    (on the application  of  Khan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384
    (IAC) which in headnote 1 provides:

         "Where there has been a significant difference between  the  income
         claimed in a previous application  for  leave  to  remain  and  the
         income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled to draw
         an inference that the Applicant has been deceitful or dishonest and
         therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules.  Such an inference could be expected where there
         is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy."

16. Thus while I find that permission was granted on a flawed basis  misled
    by what was asserted in the  Grounds  I  have  nevertheless  considered
    whether the findings made by the Judge in respect of  paragraph  322(5)
    were open to her.

17. The starting point as set out in Khan is that where  the  Secretary  of
    State discovers a significant difference between the income claimed  in
    a previous application for leave to remain and the income  declared  to
    HMRC (as here), she is entitled to draw an inference that the Applicant
    has been deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
    within paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

18. The Judge set out in detail the history of the case against  which  she
    made her findings (paragraph 20). She recognised quite  correctly  that
    as this was an allegation of fraud her approach was as set  out  in  SM
    and Qadir. It was clearly open to her to  find  that  as  there  was  a
    discrepancy  in  the  amount  of  income  declared  for  the   Tier   1
    applications and that which was declared to HMRC and in one of the  tax
    years the difference was of �47,000. Having found this it was  open  to
    her to find that the Respondent had satisfied the initial legal  burden
    on them.

19. The Judge then at paragraph 23 onwards examined the  explanation  given
    by the Appellant for these discrepancies in essence that this  was  the
    fault of his accountant based on  unreliable  evidence  from  a  former
    accountant and that he had rectified the position as soon as he  became
    aware of it(paragraph 23)The Judge  acknowledges  that  no  prosecution
    followed but properly finds that  this  was  not  a  requirement  under
    paragraph 322(5)

20. The examination of his explanation is very detailed (paragraphs 26 -47)
    While Mr Shah sought to argue that too much emphasis was placed on  the
    Appellant being well educated it was clearly open to her to  take  into
    account that this was income derived from self  employment  by  someone
    who had gained a Masters Degree in Finance and Business in the  UK  and
    while she noted that he claimed he did not study a tax  module  it  was
    open to her to find that he would have understood the notion of taxable
    profits.

21. Mr Shah suggests that the Appellant had nothing to gain  from  what  he
    did: this is utterly disingenuous. He paid less tax and  as  the  Judge
    noted at paragraph 29 had he based his  visa  application  on  what  he
    declared to HMRC he would not have received the necessary points to  be
    granted leave under the Points based scheme.

22. It was open to the Judge to find at paragraphs 30-31 that the  evidence
    provided by his accountants and what was claimed by the  Appellant  was
    inconsistent. Mr Shah criticises as speculation the Judges  finding  at
    paragraph 32 that she would have expected the Appellant  to  have  been
    asked to approve the figures sent to HMRC: in Khan at paragraph  33  Mr
    Justice Spencer makes exactly the same point

         "Thus, the Secretary of State is entitled to take into account that
         even where an accountant has made an error, the accountant will  or
         should have asked the taxpayer  to  confirm  that  the  return  was
         accurate and to have signed the  tax return,  and  furthermore  the
         Applicant will have known of his or her  earnings   and  will  have
         expected to pay tax thereon."

23. It was open to the Judge to find that there was no evidence of any kind
    including previous correspondence (either between the Appellant and his
    previous accountants or between his new accountants  and  the  previous
    ones) to show that the previous accountants who were being  blamed  for
    giving inaccurate information to his new accountants existed (paragraph
    33) There has never been a complaint made by him  to  any  professional
    body.

24. It was open to her to find that the size of the discrepancy was such as
    to militate against this being a simple error and that he must have had
    some idea of what tax he was likely to be asked to pay and  again  this
    is a factor that is set out in headnote (iv) of Khan as  a  matter  the
    fact finder is entitled to take into account.

25. It was open to the Judge to find in the absence of  any  evidence  that
    HMRC requires such reviews as his accountants  claimed  they  did  when
    discovering this 'error'  that she did not find it  credible  that  his
    accountants simply decide to  carry  out  unpaid  work  they  were  not
    required to do and also to find that this was not the explanation given
    by the Appellant in his tax questionnaire  (paragraphs  40-41)  It  was
    open to the Judge to find the timing of his resolution of the underpaid
    tax as being significant coming as it did before his application to the
    Respondent.

26. The Judge then summarises at paragraphs  45-47  why  she  rejected  the
    Appellants explanation and I am satisfied given that she  examined  all
    of the evidence in a way that was entirely  consistent  with  Khan  the
    weight she gave to the various factors was a matter  for  her.  It  was
    open to the Respondent to exercise the discretion against the Appellant
    and he did not meet the Rules.

27. That was the backdrop against which the Judge considered Article 8  and
    I told Mr Shah that his suggestion that her analysis  was  cursory  and
    superficial had no merit whatsoever. He  was  unable  to  identify  any
    factor, and piece of evidence  that  she  overlooked  in  her  detailed
    analysis which ran to 13 paragraphs looking  at  the  circumstances  of
    both him and his wife and children  who  are  all  Pakistani  nationals
    where the children have been in the UK for less than 7 years. Again she
    draws all the  strands  together  at  paragraph  62-63  and  reached  a
    conclusion that was open to  her  on  the  evidence  that  removal  was
    proportionate  against  the  background  that  he  had  not   met   the
    requirements of the Rules.

CONCLUSION

28. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

29. The appeal is dismissed.
