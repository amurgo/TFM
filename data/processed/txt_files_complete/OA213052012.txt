For the Appellant:     No representative
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 27th May  1989  and  she
    appealed against the decision dated  2nd  October  2012  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to refuse her entry clearance application  dated  5th
    April 2012, as a spouse of Mr Tahir Ayub a British citizen present  and
    settled in the UK and who has worked as a  minicab  driver  with  Swiss
    Cottage Car Services Limited from 2010 to date.

 2. The appeal of Mrs Tahir was refused by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    Woolley on 31st October 2013 on the basis that the sponsor's income for
    the year 2012 to 2013 was insufficient.

 3. At paragraph 18 of  her  determination  the  judge  recorded  that  the
    sponsor produced a letter from his accountant Messrs N Malik  &  Co,  a
    tax return and letter from HMRC from which the judge was satisfied that
    he made �10,456 gross, net �9,586 for the tax year 2012  -  2013.   The
    judge stated that 'the sponsor has not provided details of  his  income
    for the year 2011/2012, despite the fact he says he  has  been  in  the
    same employment since 2010.'  The judge  added  that  the  letter  from
    Swiss Cottage Car Service did not say how long he had worked  for  them
    [18].  The judge found that the tax paid was in fact for the  tax  year
    2010 to 2011.

 4. The judge did make reference to the fact that the appellant  or  rather
    it was the sponsor  had  savings  of  �3,994.13  at  the  date  of  the
    decision.

 5. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that  the
    judge confused herself by taking into account irrelevant issues such as
    the brother's rent in the house where the sponsor lived and whether the
    brother would move in or out.  There was no evidence before  the  judge
    as to whether the sponsor's brother would remain  and  the  judge  also
    failed to consider that a three bedroom house was too big for a  single
    couple and they may rent out further rooms.

 6. Further the judge did not consider the  current  circumstances  of  the
    sponsor's bank account, his current earnings and concluded in paragraph
    18 that the sponsor had not provided details of his income for 2011  to
    2012.

 7. Further it was contested that the judge failed to consider and  include
    the �3,994.13 of the savings in any analysis of  the  shortfall.   This
    was a significant amount of money for the sponsor and the judge did not
    take this into account.

 8. The application was made prior to the advent of  Appendix  FM  and  the
    refusal was based on paragraph 281(v) that 'the parties will be able to
    maintain themselves and any dependants adequately without  recourse  to
    public funds.'

 9. The only issue remaining as at the First-tier Tribunal was the issue of
    income.

The Hearing

10. Mr Ayub the sponsor attended court and stated that he had submitted the
    evidence in the form of bank statements.  Mr  Ayub  gave  evidence  and
    stated that his brother moved in June or July  2012  and  no  one  else
    lived in the property.  However there was no statement from his brother
    regarding the rent.  He stated that his brother was still there.

11. Mr Kandola submitted that the income  support  levels  were  identified
    correctly by the First-tier Tribunal Judge at �111.45 per  week  for  a
    couple.  This equated to �445 per month.  The sponsor had  stated  that
    he had accommodation costs of �300 a month  but  the  application  form
    indicated that the cost was  �600  a  month.   In  addition  there  was
    council tax of �100.  This meant that the  appellant  was  required  to
    show the sum of �1,145.  The sponsor claimed that he  earned  �184  per
    week which was  the  equivalent  of  �736  per  month.   Therefore  the
    shortfall was �408 per month.  The ISA could be taken into account  but
    this was as at the date of decision on 2nd October 2012 �3,444.  Over a
    period of two years this equated to �144 per  month.   Therefore  there
    was, if �144 was subtracted from �408, a shortfall of �264 per month.

12. Mr Kandola submitted at the date of decision the property was  occupied
    exclusively by the appellant and this was confirmed in  the  inspection
    report.  There was no evidence that the brother paid half the rent.



Conclusions

13. The appellant was found from the documentation to have been in  receipt
    of �9,586 for the tax year 2012 to 2013 and  indeed  tax  documentation
    was produced to this effect.  This equates to �798.83 per month.   Both
    the application form and inspection report for the  property  in  Luton
    indicated that the appellant's sponsor alone occupied the property  for
    which the rent was �600 per month.  The evidence given by  the  sponsor
    was that his brother had moved in June or July 2012 but  there  was  no
    evidence to  this  save  the  sponsor's  oral  evidence.   The  sponsor
    confirmed that he alone was responsible for the contract.

14. I also note that at the 2nd October 2012 the sponsor had  an  overdraft
    of �1,366.61 which would increase the shortfall.

15. Jahangara Begum and others (maintenance -  savings)  Bangladesh  [2011]
    UKUT 00246 (IAC) confirms

    'Where the likely income of a family falls below the level of  adequacy
    as established in the case of KA and others (Adequacy  of  Maintenance)
    Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065 the shortfall can be met  where  there  are
    sufficient savings. The assessment of the appropriate level of  savings
    is not an arbitrary calculation and the  proper  reference  is  to  the
    length of the initial visa.  If  an  appellant  is  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of adequacy for the period of the initial visa, and  there
    is no reason  to  believe  that  he  will  not  be  able  to  meet  the
    maintenance requirements in the longer term, then  he  is  entitled  to
    entry clearance'.

16. Further to KA the appellant needed to show that the  sponsor  had  �445
    per month for subsistence, �600 per month for rent and �100  per  month
    for council tax.  The sponsor earned �798.83  per  month.   He  has  in
    addition savings of �3,444.  The length of the visa  in  this  instance
    would be two years and this equates to �143.50  per  month.  I  am  not
    persuaded that the ISA savings of �3,444 could  sustain  the  appellant
    over the two year period and therefore under the Immigration Rules  and
    indeed this sum ignores the overdraft  of  the  sponsor.   I  make  the
    shortfall without taking into account the overdraft, �202.67 per month.

17. I find that the appellant cannot show that she and the sponsor are able
    to maintain themselves further to the immigration rules and  I  dismiss
    the appeal.

18. In fact no appeal was raised in respect of  Article  8  either  in  the
    appeal to the First Tier Tribunal or in the application for  permission
    to appeal.





19. I remake the decision and dismiss the appeal.
