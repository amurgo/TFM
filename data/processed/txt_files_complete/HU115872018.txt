For the Appellant:     Mr M Moriarty, Counsel, instructed by Everest Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms R Bassi, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Plumptre (the judge), promulgated on 10 May 2019, in which
         she dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
         decision dated 9 May 2018 refusing his entry clearance  application
         to join his mother, the widow of a former Ghurkha soldier.



Background

      2. The appellant is a national of Nepal, date of birth 8  March  1980.
         His mother, Mrs Jan Kumari Limbu, is the widow of Mr Kamal  Bahadar
         Limbu, a former Gurkha who died on 18 January 2001  in  Nepal.  The
         appellant's father had enlisted as a Gurkha on  13  September  1970
         and was discharged on 21 May 1986 having served in the British Army
         for 15 years and 250 days. The appellant,  the  youngest  of  three
         children, was born in Syria where  his  father  was  deployed,  his
         sister was born in Nepal on 16 September 1977 and his older brother
         was born in Hong Kong on 9 December 1978.

      3. The appellant's mother learnt about a change in policy relating  to
         Gurkhas which allowed ex-Gurkhas and their families to live in  the
         UK. She saved money in order to make an application  to  settle  in
         the UK under the policy and was granted ILR on 21  June  2012.  She
         entered the UK on 12 May 2013, the delay caused in part because she
         had to save money for her plane ticket.

      4. The appellant's mother stayed in the UK  for  10  months  and  then
         returned to Nepal on 9 March 2014 and remained for nearly  2  years
         before returning to the UK on 27 January 2016. She  saved  up  more
         money in order to make an application for  the  appellant  although
         she had insufficient funds to make an application for her daughter.

      5. The appellant applied for entry clearance  on  3  April  2018.  The
         respondent refused the application under Annex K of the Immigration
         Directorate Instructions (IDI), Chapter 15,  section  2A  13.2,  as
         amended on 5 January 2015, and paragraph EC-DR.1.1 of  Appendix  FM
         of  the  immigration  rules.  The  respondent  also   refused   the
         application under Article 8 ECHR as she was not satisfied that  the
         appellant had established  family  life  with  his  widowed  mother
         sufficient to trigger the operation of  Article  8.  The  appellant
         exercised his right  of  appeal  under  s.82  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.



The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      6.  It  was  conceded  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  by  the
         appellant's representative that the appellant could  not  meet  the
         requirements of Appendix K of  the  IDIs  or  the  requirements  of
         Appendix FM and that the appeal was to be determined  by  reference
         to Article 8 alone.

      7. Although there was cross  examination  of  the  appellant's  mother
         concerning  the  location  of   his   older   brother   and   other
         relations/family members in Nepal,  and  in  respect  of  documents
         produced from Nepal, there was little or no challenge to the  facts
         set out in the mother's witness statement [9].

      8. The judge found that, after spending  3  years  living  with  their
         father in Brunei, the appellant and his siblings accompanied  their
         mother back to Nepal where they lived in the family home in  Dudhe,
         Jhapa District ([14]  &  [15]).  Their  living  circumstances  were
         basic. There was a plot of land attached to the house on which  the
         appellant's family grew food and other necessities  were  paid  for
         out of his late father's Gurkha pension (around 300 Nepali  rupees)
         [14]. The judge found that, until their mother chose to  settle  in
         the UK, the appellant and his sister lived in the same family house
         with their mother, growing  their  own  food  supplemented  by  the
         mother's widow's army pension (the oldest son lives  in  Hong  Kong
         and has no wish to enter the UK).

      9. The judge accepted that the appellant  and  his  sister  had  never
         found employment in Nepal and that  they  were  unmarried  ([18]  &
         [23]). The judge accepted that the appellant's mother stayed in the
         UK for 10 months after first entering and then  returned  to  Nepal
         for  nearly  2  years  [20].  The  judge  also  accepted  that  the
         appellant's mother had visited him and his sister in Nepal [21].

     10.  The  judge  accepted   the   calculations   of   the   appellant's
         representative that his mother had a monthly income of  �752.53  of
         which �300 went on rent (made up from housing benefit  and  pension
         credit) [22]. The judge found that the appellant had three maternal
         aunts one of whom lived in the same  Jhapa  District,  another  who
         lived in Morang, and the third who lived in a hilly area  that  the
         mother did not name. The judge accepted that all her late husband's
         siblings had died and that there were no paternal aunts  or  uncles
         living in Nepal [24].

     11. At [25] the judge adopted the respondent's statement, contained  in
         the  decision  refusing  entry  clearance,   that   generally   the
         protection of family  life  under  Article  8  involved  cohabiting
         dependents, usually parents and dependent minor children, and  that
         relationships between adults  would  not  necessarily  acquire  the
         protection of Article 8 without evidence  of  further  elements  of
         dependency involving more than normal emotional ties and  that  "if
         dependency is read as meaning 'support', in the personal sense  and
         if  one  adds  echoing  the  Strasbourg  jurisprudence  'real'   or
         'committed'  or  'effective'  to  the  word  'support'  then   this
         represents the irreducible minimum of  what  family  life  implies"
         (citing from Sedley LJ in Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31).

     12. At [26] the judge adopted the 5-step approach  set  out  in  Razgar
         [2004] UKHL 27. The judge accepted, at [27], that the fact that the
         appellant's mother chose to come and settle in the  UK  was  not  a
         factor to be held against him.  The  judge  also  acknowledged  the
         legal representative's submission that, "... but for the historical
         injustice the appellant's ex-Gurkha father would have come  to  the
         UK with his children to settle in the UK."

     13. At [28] the judge stated,

             "I find some force in the Presenting Officer's submission that
             the appellant has  close  family  members,  namely  his  older
             sister and 3 maternal aunts, and hence family life with family
             members  all  living  in  Nepal,  and  that  essentially   the
             appellant and his older sister are  living  independent  lives
             from their mother as the appellant is now 39 years old and his
             sister 43 years  old.  I  accept  the  sponsor  mother's  oral
             evidence that her 2 adult children continue  to  live  in  the
             family home and grow crops to support themselves on  the  plot
             of land attached to the house."

     14. The judge then referred to the Court  of  Appeal  decision  in  Rai
         [2017] EWCA Civ 320 noting that Mr Rai was 26 years old at the time
         of his application for leave to enter  based  on  his  relationship
         with his late Gurkha father and distinguishing Rai from the present
         case because  the  appellant  was  aged  38  at  the  time  of  his
         application "... and hence well  outside  the  age  limits  of  the
         policy set out in Annex K and adopted by the  Respondent  to  right
         the "historic injustice" of adult dependent children  of  ex-Gurkha
         children" [30]. At [31] the judge found that the present  case  was
         not an historic injustice case in the sense that the appellant's ex-
         Gurkha father died many years before the latest policy incorporated
         into Annex K came into being in 2015, and because the appellant was
         considerably older than the age limits of between 18-30  years  for
         adult dependent children and because he was living  an  independent
         life with his sister.

     15. At [32], after noting that the appellant's mother chose  to  settle
         in the UK at some financial sacrifice to herself when she was  well
         aware of that  adult  dependent  children  were  not  automatically
         granted  settlement,  the  judge  found  there  had  been  "...   a
         considerable emotional sacrifice by the sponsor  mother  since  she
         has no relatives in the UK, has hearing problems and lives  on  her
         own with a neighbourly landlady who was much younger than  her  and
         who is not a relative." At [34] the judge stated,

             "It was troubling to learn that the sponsor had sent the sum of
             �425 to her son in Nepal  -  see  page  38  virtually  all  the
             sponsor mother disposable income for  that  month  which  would
             last a long time in Nepal, and that she did so because  he  had
             borrowed money from friends. As  submitted  by  the  presenting
             officer, I find that  the  money  transfers  are  sporadic  and
             conclude that she is not the appellant's sole source of income.
             I find that financial dependence has not been established,  and
             that  the  appellant  is  an  adult  who  has  been  living  an
             independent life in Nepal."

     16. At [35] the judge stated,

             "I give weight to the fact that the  appellant  is  a  healthy
             adult male who has spent all of his life in Nepal and lives in
             the family home with his adult sister and  that  they  have  a
             plot of land which  they  can  cultivate  and  grow  crops  to
             maintain themselves. I find that although it has  been  argued
             in  Nepalese  Gurkha  cases  that   Kugathas   has   been   to
             restrictively interpreted, there was no evidence  to  indicate
             more than normal emotional ties between the appellant and  his
             sponsor mother on the facts of  this  appeal.  I  accept  that
             there was evidence of telephone contact as one would expect. I
             adopt the reasoning of the manager on review that Article 8 is
             not engaged on the facts of this appeal."

     17. Having found that Article 8 was not engaged the judge dismissed the
         appeal [37].



The grounds of appeal and the parties' submissions

     18. The grounds of appeal contend that  the  judge's  factual  findings
         clearly pointed to the existence of Article 8 family life and  that
         the reasons upon which she relied in concluding otherwise disclosed
         errors of law. The judge found that the money  transfers  from  Mrs
         Limbu to the appellant were 'sporadic',  but  she  failed  to  give
         adequate reasons for this conclusion and  her  conclusion  was  not
         supported by the documentary evidence. Even if the  transfers  were
         sporadic, this was irrelevant to determining whether there  existed
         'real', 'effective' or 'committed' support. The Judge's  conclusion
         that the appellant was leading an independent life was  principally
         based on his age, but there was no upper age limit to the existence
         of family life and the judge's reference to Mr Rai's  age  and  the
         time limits in Appendix  K  disclosed  a  misunderstanding  of  the
         relevance  of  the  'historic  injustice'  which  impacted  on  her
         assessment of the existence of family life.

     19. In his oral submissions Mr Moriarty submitted that the existence of
         an historic injustice  underpinned  the  mother's  application  and
         entry to the UK and that it contextualised the family relationship.
         Having regard to the actual  money  transfers  the  judge  was  not
         entitled to call them sporadic,  and  they  demonstrated  financial
         dependence. The judge's finding that the appellant  was  living  an
         independent life was based on his age and in reaching this  finding
         she improperly  considered  the  age  limits  in  Appendix  K  when
         assessing the actual nature of the Article 8 relationship.

     20. Ms Bassi accepted that the judge's finding that the money transfers
         were 'sporadic' was not supported by the actual evidence  of  money
         transfers. Ms Bassi also accepted that  the  judge's  reasoning  at
         [30] was difficult to uphold because the time limits in Appendix  K
         were not determinative of the existence of family  life.  Mr  Bassi
         nevertheless submitted that the decision  was  sustainable  because
         the judge did refer to Rai and directed herself in accordance  with
         the Kugathas approach and was entitled to find that  the  appellant
         was living an independent life because he and his sister grew crops
         and because of his age.



Discussion

     21. The approach to relationships  between  adult  children  and  their
         parents has been considered in  a  line  of  cases  beginning  with
         Kugathas v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2003]  EWCA
         Civ 31 and which include Singh & Anor v Secretary of State for  the
         Home Department [2015]  EWCA  Civ  630,  PT  (Sri  Lanka)  v  Entry
         Clearance Officer, Chennai [2016] EWCA Civ 612, Butt v Secretary of
         State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 184, and Rai v  Entry
         Clearance Officer, New Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320. "In the  case  of
         adults, in the context of immigration control, there is no legal or
         factual presumption as to the existence or absence of  family  life
         for the purposes of Article 8.... It all  depends  on  the  facts."
         (Singh, at [24]). In determining the  nature  and  quality  of  the
         relationship between the appellant and his mother the  judge  asked
         herself whether the appellant's mother provided him with  "support"
         which was "real" or "committed" or "effective" (see,  for  example,
         paragraph 36 of Rai) and whether there  were  further  elements  of
         dependency involving  more  than  the  normal  emotional  ties.  In
         concluding that there was no relationship of sufficient quality  to
         engage Article  8  the  judge  relied  on  her  findings  that  the
         appellant was living an  independent  life  and  that  he  was  not
         financially supported by his mother. For  the  reasons  essentially
         contained in the grounds I  am  persuaded  that,  in  reaching  her
         conclusion, the  judge  misdirected  herself  in  relation  to  the
         evidence of financial support and misdirected herself in respect of
         the relevance of Appendix K to the appellant's age  when  assessing
         whether he was living an independent life and  in  respect  of  his
         relationship with his mother.

     22. Ms Bassi properly accepted, and it was, in  any  event,  manifestly
         clear from the money transfer receipts, that the appellant's mother
         sent him funds relatively regularly and frequently. The appellant's
         bundle contains transfer slips relating to the transfer of funds in
         January, February and March  2019,  in  January,  February,  April,
         June, July, August, September, October and November  2018,  and  in
         December 2017.  Most of these transfers were for  between  �60  and
         �150, although the transfer in March 2019 was for �425.  The  judge
         expressed concern at this last transfer, which was  caused  by  the
         appellant having to borrow money from friends, commenting that  his
         mother would have had "virtually  nothing"  to  live  on  for  that
         month. The reasons for the transfer  were  not  however  challenged
         and, as pointed out in the grounds, this large  transfer  supported
         the appellant's claim as it indicated that the  appellant's  mother
         was his ultimate source of money and that he had to rely on her  to
         pay off a loan. The evidence did not disclose 'sporadic' transfers.
         To the extent that the judge relied on her finding that  the  money
         transfers were 'sporadic', she  took  into  account  an  irrelevant
         consideration. Nor was there any other evidential basis  supporting
         the judge's finding that the appellant's mother was  not  his  sole
         source of income. The judge accepted that the appellant  had  never
         been employed in Nepal [18], that the family grew  their  own  food
         and that other necessities were  paid  out  of  his  late  father's
         Ghurkha pension [14].

     23. I am additionally persuaded that the judge erred in law by  finding
         that the  appellant  was  leading  an  independent  life  primarily
         because of his age. The judge  was  undoubtedly  entitled  to  have
         regard to the appellant's  age  when  determining  whether  he  was
         leading an independent life. This  is  unarguably  a  significantly
         relevant factor. As a general observation the older adult  children
         get, the more likely it is that they  will  be  living  independent
         lives and that their relationships  with  their  parents,  even  if
         close, will be insufficient to engage Article 8. On  the  facts  of
         this case the judge accepted that the appellant  had  always  lived
         with his mother and continued to reside in  the  family  home  even
         after she came to the UK, that he was not employed and not married,
         that the appellant's mother returned soon after entering the UK and
         remained for nearly two years, that she visited Nepal and that they
         maintained frequent  telephone  contact.  The  mother's  statement,
         which the judge acknowledged was not challenged, indicated that the
         appellant and his mother missed  each  other  intensely,  that  the
         appellant was miserable being separated, and that he has never  had
         an independent relationship.

     24. At [28], whilst noting that the appellant lived with his sister and
         that  they  support  themselves  by  growing   crops,   the   judge
         essentially concluded that the appellant was leading an independent
         life because of his age. There is however no  upper  age  limit  on
         family life amongst adults (see Etti Adegbola v  SSHD  [2009]  EWCA
         Civ 1319). It is not apparent that  this  was  appreciated  by  the
         judge. Moreover, at [29] and [30] the judge distinguishes the facts
         of Rai from the present case because Mr Rai was 26 years old at the
         relevant  time  and,  as  a  38  year  old  (at  the  date  of  his
         application), the appellant was "well outside the age limits of the
         policy set out in Annex K and adopted by the  Respondent  to  right
         the "historic injustice" of adult dependent children of ex  Ghurkha
         children [sic]."  As  accepted  by  Ms  Bassi,  this  reasoning  is
         difficult to follow. The judge appears to be saying  that,  because
         the respondent has set her 2015 policy with an upper age  limit  of
         30, and  because  the  appellant  was  over  30,  this  was  not  a
         historical injustice case as the appellant's father  died  in  2001
         and the policy only came  into  being  in  2015  (see  [31]).  This
         reasoning is unsustainable in  light  of  Limbu  [2008]  EWHC  2261
         (Admin) and Gurung [2013]  EWCA  Civ  8.  But  for  the  historical
         injustice the appellant would have  settled  in  the  UK  with  his
         family in 1986,  when  he  was  6  years  old.  The  injustice  was
         partially corrected in 2009 but by that time the appellant  was  29
         years old. Had Annex K been introduced in  2009  the  appellant  is
         most likely to have fallen  within  its  terms.  The  injustice  of
         excluding children aged over 18 was not addressed  until  the  2015
         version of Annex K but by this time the appellant was over the  age
         of 30. The historic injustice  has  always  directly  affected  the
         appellant. By seemingly determining, at least to a material degree,
         whether the appellant was leading an independent life by  reference
         to Annex K, the judge has misdirected herself in law.

     25. I satisfied, for the  reasons  given,  that  the  judge's  decision
         contains errors on points of law and that it must be set aside.



Re-making of decision

     26. With the  consent  of  both  parties  I  proceeded  to  remake  the
         decision. The  appellant's  representatives  had  provided  further
         evidence pursuant to rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
         Tribunal)  Rules  2008.  The  new  evidence  consisted  of  further
         documents evidencing money transfers from Mrs  Limbu  to  her  son,
         further regular and frequent telephone calls, and documents showing
         that Mr Limbu had booked to  visit  Nepal  in  November  2019.  The
         appellant's mother was not called to give further oral evidence.

     27. Ms Bassi submitted that this further evidence was similar  to  that
         already considered by the First-tier Tribunal and that the evidence
         did not demonstrate that Article 8 was engaged. Mr  Bassi  accepted
         that if Article 8 was  engaged  (i.e.  if  there  was  family  life
         between the  appellant  and  his  mother),  the  refusal  of  entry
         clearance constituted an interference with Article 8, and that,  in
         light of the historical injustice, the  proportionality  assessment
         was likely to fall in favour of the appellant, taking full  account
         of the factors in s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
         Act 2002.

     28. Mr Moriarty invited me to  find  that  the  payments  made  to  the
         appellant by his mother  remained  significant,  that  he  was  not
         leading an independent life as he was not in  a  relationship  with
         anyone else and had never been, and, in  light  of  their  previous
         cohabitation  and  the  strength   of   their   relationship,   the
         appellant's mother provided him with "support" which was "real"  or
         "committed" or "effective".

     29. I  remind  myself  that  the  burden  rests  on  the  appellant  to
         demonstrate the existence of family life and that the  respondent's
         decision breach Article 8, and that the standard of  proof  is  the
         balance of probabilities.

     30. There has been little challenge to the basic facts  of  this  case.
         There is no reason for me to disturb most of the  primary  findings
         of Judge Plumptre, other  than  those  I  have  already  considered
         above. The appellant is a 39-year-old man who lives, together  with
         his 43-year-old sister, in a house owned by  their  mother  with  a
         small plot of land which they use  to  cultivate  their  own  food.
         Until his mother obtained entry clearance under the Ghurkha  policy
         the appellant had always lived with his mother and sister.  He  has
         never been in employment and has never been in a relationship.  The
         appellant  became  demoralised  when  his  father  died  and   left
         education. According to his statement the appellant spent  most  of
         his time at home doing chores. Having spent his whole  life  living
         with his mother the appellant now misses her considerably  and  she
         misses him. There was no challenge to this evidence and I accept it
         as being accurate. The appellant maintains that he  is  financially
         dependent on his mother. The evidence relating to money  transfers,
         which I have already considered, supports this  assertion.  I  find
         that the appellant (and his sister) rely on their mother for  their
         living expenses and other needs.

     31. After she entered the UK in pursuit of her entitlement as a  result
         of her late husband's service in the British Army, the  appellant's
         mother returned to Nepal for nearly two years. I am satisfied  this
         was in  order  to  maintain  her  relationship  with  her  son  and
         daughter. I find this is indicative of a strong family bond between
         the appellant and his mother. Although  the  appellant  is  now  39
         years old, he has always lived with his mother, he has  never  been
         in any relationship of his own, and  has  always  been  financially
         supported  by  her.  this  points  to  a  very   strong   emotional
         relationship between the appellant and  his  mother.  Although  the
         appellant has some extended family in Nepal and he lives  with  his
         sister, neither can be described as living independently. They both
         reside in their  mother's  home  and  rely  on  her  for  financial
         support. In the relatively  unusual  circumstances  of  this  case,
         where the appellant has  never  previously  lived  apart  from  his
         mother and has no significant qualifications, and has never worked,
         I am persuaded that he is being provided with real or committed  or
         effective support by his mother and  that  this  relationship  does
         contain elements elevating it  beyond  the  normal  emotional  ties
         between adult children and their parents. I consequently find there
         is family life between the appellant  and  his  mother  within  the
         terms of article 8(1) ECHR, and that the refusal of entry clearance
         interferes with that family life relationship.

     32. Having found that there is family life, and  in  light  Ms  Bassi's
         concession in respect of article 8(2), and in the  absence  of  any
         other factor relating to the appellant's character, and having full
         regard to the factors in s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and
         Asylum Act 2002, I find, particularly  in  light  of  the  historic
         injustice, that  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  constitutes  a
         disproportionate interference with Article 8.



Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by material errors of  law  and
is set aside.

I remake the decision, allowing the appeal on human rights grounds.
