                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Grenada date of birth 30th August 1979.
     In a decision promulgated on the  20th  January  2015  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Pooler) allowed her appeal against a decision to refuse
    to grant her entry clearance as the partner of  a  person  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom. The case concerned whether  or  not  the
    Respondent met the definition of a 'partner' in GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM.
    The First-tier Tribunal found that she did, and so allowed  her  appeal
    with reference to the Immigration Rules. The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    (ECO) now has permission to appeal against that decision[1].


    Background


 2. The application for entry clearance was made in November 2013  and  was
    supported by numerous documents including detailed representations  and
    written statements by both Respondent and her Sponsor, British national
    Mr Ian Wilkins.  The tenor of their evidence was that  they  had  known
    each other for many years but had been  in  a  relationship  since  May
    2009.  Mr Wilkins is employed by HSBC in London as a  Computer  Systems
    Programmer and does not wish to leave his employment. The  couple  have
    spent various periods living together since  July  2009  but  have  not
    lived together for a continuous period of two years.  She  has  visited
    the UK and stayed with him, and he has travelled to the Caribbean to be
    with her.  A schedule of the time that they  have  spent  together  was
    provided. They  have  had  two  children  together,  one  of  whom  was
    stillborn. The written  representations  accompanying  the  application
    acknowledged that GEN.1.2 requires  unmarried  couples  to  have  lived
    together in a relationship akin to marriage  for  at  least  two  years
    prior to the application being made, but relied on  published  guidance
    given to ECOs which stated that there could be gaps in  the  continuous
    cohabitation.  It  was  submitted  on  the  Respondent's  behalf   that
    circumstances have prevented her from living  with  Mr  Wilkins  for  a
    continuous period of two years but that  according  to  that  guidance,
    this is not a problem. The following extract was cited:


         SET5.12 Assessing whether the relationship has subsisted for two
         years


         'Living together', should be applied fairly tightly, with a couple
         providing evidence that they have been living together in a
         relationship akin to marriage or civil partnership which has
         subsisted for two years or more.


         Periods apart for up to six months would be acceptable for good
         reasons, such as work commitments, or looking after a relative as
         long as:


            o it was not possible for the other partner to accompany; and
            o the applicant can show evidence that the relationship
              continued throughout that period, for example, by visits,
              letters, logged phone calls.

    The letter of representations  covering  the  application  asserts  the
    parties' intentions to  live  together  permanently  in  the  UK  in  a
    relationship akin to marriage, relies on the guidance and submits  that
    the Respondent meets the requirements of the Rule.

 3. In the Notice of Refusal the ECO refers  to  paragraph  EC-P.1.1(d)  of
    Appendix FM which requires the applicant to be  the  'partner'  of  her
    Sponsor.  That term is defined at  GEN.1.2.   The  ECO  refers  to  the
    Respondent's acknowledgment that she has lived with Mr Wilkins "for  at
    least  six  months  every  year  since  2010"  and  finds   that   this
    demonstrates that she has not lived with him for at least 2 years.  The
    ECO finds that furthermore the Respondent has not provided evidence  of
    cohabitation.

 4. On the 8th October 2014 an Entry Clearance Manager upheld the decision.
    In her detailed review the ECM refers to the guidance  relied  upon  by
    the Respondent (cited above) and emphasises  the  requirement  that  it
    should not be possible for the parties  to  be  together.  Since  there
    would appear to be no particular reason why they chose to  live  apart,
    they cannot be considered to be partners under the Immigration Rules.

 5. When the matter came before the First-tier  Tribunal  Mr  Wilkins  gave
    live  evidence  and  the  Respondent  submitted   further   documentary
    evidence. The determination sets out in detail  the  periods  that  the
    couple were living together, and the evidence of  Mr  Wilkins  that  he
    felt unable to leave his job with HSBC as there was not  really  be  an
    equivalent position in Grenada.  They wanted to live  together  in  the
    UK. They had lost a child in 2012 and in 2013 their son had been  born.
    They wanted to recover and settled  down  together  before  planning  a
    marriage.  They wanted to take their time over this - that is  why  she
    had not applied for a fiancï¿½ visa, because they did not  intend  to  be
    married within 6 months.  The Tribunal adopted the  calculations  in  a
    prepared schedule which showed that in the  two  years  "prior  to  the
    application" being made the parties had  been  living  together  for  a
    total period of 329 days and apart  for  a  total  of  394  days.   The
    longest single period that they had been  apart  was  124  days.    The
    parties agreed that the Tribunal should have  regard  to  the  guidance
    cited in support of the application and relied upon  by  the  ECM,  but
    Judge Pooler identified that in fact this guidance applied to  the  old
    pre-Appendix FM Rules.  He invited written submissions on whether  this
    made a difference to the task he had to  undertake.  The  ECO  made  no
    submissions; the Respondent submitted that it was for the  Tribunal  to
    interpret the phrase "living together".  The  determination  makes  the
    following findings:


         "I am  satisfied  that  the  parties  had  prior  to  the  date  of
         application spent 329 days together in a period of two years.  They
         had a future intention to marry  but  for  practical  and  personal
         reasons had chosen not to marry prior to  that  date.  They  had  a
         child  together  and  their  relationship  was  both  genuine   and
         subsisting. Their decision  not  to  live  together  was  based  on
         reasons which were cogent and reasonable:  the  appellant  was  not
         permitted to  live  permanently  in  the  UK  while  the  sponsor's
         employment was based in the UK and he could not relocate if he  was
         to continue providing for his wife and child. I find that they  had
         been living together for at least two years prior to  the  date  of
         application because they demonstrated a  degree  of  commitment  to
         each other similar to that found in a  marriage  or  between  those
         engaged to be married"


    On that basis the appeal was allowed under the Immigration Rules.



      The Grounds, Response and Submissions

 6. The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal on the  grounds
    that the Tribunal erred in law by:

        i) Making contradictory findings: having accepted that  the  couple
           had only lived together for 329 days,  finding that they met the
           requirements of GEN.1.2 that they had  lived  together  for  two
           years;


       ii)  Misconstruing  GEN.1.2  to  find  that  the   nature   of   the
           relationship would be capable of compensating for  the  lack  of
           cohabitation.

 7. Mr Bazini opposed the appeal. He argued that  whatever  might  be  said
    about the First-tier Tribunal's calculations or reasoning, the decision
    had been the right one because it was apparent from  the  chronology  -
    expressly accepted by the Tribunal - that the couple had  in  the  past
    cohabitated for well over 2 years. They had,  for  instance  spent  565
    days  together  between  April  2010  and  April  2012  with  only  one
    substantial separation of approximately 5 months, necessitated by  visa
    restrictions and the fact that the Sponsor  had  to  work.  These  were
    found to be cogent reasons by the Tribunal in accordace with the stated
    policy, and the overall reasoning was sound. Where Mr  Bazini  diverged
    from the Tribunal was  in  its  apparent  reading-in  to  GEN1.2  of  a
    requirement that the couple had  been  cohabiting  for  the  two  years
    immediately prior to the application being made.  It would appear  that
    this was the basis of the calculation that the couple  had  only  spent
    329 days together.


 8. Before me Mr Walker very sensibly declined, having had  regard  to  the
    chronology,  to pursue these  grounds.  He  acknowledged  that  GEN.1.2
    contains no requirement that  the  couple  need  to  have  been  living
    together for the two years immediately prior  to  the  application,  as
    both the drafter of the grounds, and indeed  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    appear to have thought.    The  chronology,  based  upon  the  accepted
    testimony of Mr Walker and documentary evidence of travel, showed  that
    between the years 2009 and 2013 the couple spent far more time together
    than they had apart. Mr Walker accepted  that  read  in  light  of  the
    guidance, this must be construed to be 'living together'.











      Error of Law Decision

 9. GEN.1.2 defines a "partner" for the purpose of Appendix FM as:
          (i) the applicant's spouse;
         (ii)the applicant's civil partner;
         (iii) the applicant's fiance?(e) or proposed civil partner; or
         (iv) a person who has been living together with the applicant in a
         relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for at least
         two years prior to the date of application.
10. The agreed chronology of cohabitation is as follows:


    Period                        Place            Days
    From         To


    May 2009     June 2009        Grenada    42
    2.4.10       16.9.10          UK         168
    27.3.11            18.8.11         UK          176
    18.9.11            18.10.11        Grenada     30
    17.11.11           10.5.12         UK          176
    25.5.12            8.6.12                St Lucia   15
    9.6.12       29.11.12         UK         174
    1.3.13       8.3.13                UK          7
    11.7.13            6.8.13                Grenada    27
    4.11.14            2.12.13         Grenada     18


11. The application was made on the 11th February 2014. As can be seen from
    the dates above, it is apparent that prior to that date the  Respondent
    and her Sponsor  spent  substantial  periods  of  time  together.   The
    Respondent had, in the two years between March  2011  and  March  2013,
    spent so much time in the United Kingdom that  an  Immigration  Officer
    saw fit to stop her at Heathrow Airport and revoke her visitors visa on
    the grounds that she was in effect living here. That  occurred  on  the
    1st March 2013, and from that date to  present  the  family  have  been
    severely hampered in their ability to be  together,  since  she  cannot
    gain entry to the UK, and Mr Wilkins ability to visit Grenada has  been
    limited to the time he can get off work.  In the  two  years  prior  to
    that decision to refuse entry (the seven days she then spent in the  UK
    was on temporary admission) they  had  spent  578  days  together.  The
    longest that they had been apart had been the three months  immediately
    prior to that last  attempted  visit.   I  am  satisfied  that  it  can
    properly be said that they were  cohabiting  during  that  period.  Any
    sensible construction of GEN.1.2 must allow  for  some  periods  apart,
    where there are good reasons. The good reason in this case was found by
    the First-tier Tribunal to be the fact that the Sponsor has  no  desire
    to give up his well paid employment with which he  supports  his  young
    family: I might add to that the Respondent's  unwillingness  to  breach
    the conditions of her visit visas.


12. Whilst it is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal erred if it did,  as
    it would appear, count backwards  from  the  date  of  decision,  I  am
    satisfied that the decision contains no material error. That is because
    on the facts it was quite proper that this appeal be allowed under  the
    Immigration Rules.




    Decision


13. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error
    of law and it is upheld.


14. In view of the delay in this matter, and the fact that a young  British
    citizen child is currently separated from his  father,  I  direct  that
    entry clearance be granted as soon as is practicable.
