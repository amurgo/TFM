For the Appellant:     Mr Hussain, instructed by Halliday Reeves Law Firm
For the Respondent:    Ms Pettersen, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Cope  made
    following hearings on 7th June and 6th August 2018  at  North  Shields.
    He dismissed the appeal.

 2. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    determination lacked clear findings and that the judge had not in  fact
    resolved the issues under appeal.

 3. Ms Pettersen accepted that the determination could not  stand  for  the
    reasons set out in the grounds and agreed that the decision would  have
    to be remade by another judge.

 4. The decision is set aside.  The judge erred in law in failing  to  give
    adequate reasons for his decision.  It is set aside.  The  appeal  will
    be reheard at Bradford by a judge other than Judge Cope.

No anonymity direction is made.
