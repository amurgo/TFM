On the application of  the  appellant  to  withdraw  her  appeal,  which  is
currently listed for hearing on 18 May 2016.

1.    In a letter dated 17 May 2016 the Secretary  of  State  confirms  that
    she wishes to withdraw her appeal with reference  to  rule  17  of  The
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

2.    Albeit that the application could  and  should  have  been  made  much
    earlier thereby avoiding a waste of court time, permission to  withdraw
    is granted.

3.    The First-tier Tribunal decision shall stand.
