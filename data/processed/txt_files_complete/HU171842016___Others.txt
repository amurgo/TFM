For the Respondent:    Mr Chris Howells (Senior HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a second stage continuation appeal  hearing,  after  the  first
    stage hearing by Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul, which was promulgated on
    19th September 2018, following a hearing  on  22nd  August  2018.   The
    appeal arises in circumstances where there had been a challenge to  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge Suffield-Thompson promulgated
    on 16th May 2017, in which she had allowed the appeal of the Appellants
    (these being the three members of  the  same  family  who  appeared  as
    Appellants in  the  Tribunal  below).   The  decision  that  was  being
    challenged at the time was made on 29th June  2016  refusing  them  all
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  The basis of that decision  was
    that these three Appellants did not meet the requirements of  paragraph
    276ADE of  the  Immigration  Rules,  and  nor  were  there  exceptional
    circumstances such that removing them from the UK was disproportionate.

Salient Facts

 2. The salient facts were set out in the Upper Tribunal decision of  Judge
    Rintoul (who took care to set out the  immigration  history  which  had
    been described at  paragraph  2  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    decision).  Basically, the first Appellant arrived in the UK  illegally
    in 2003.  An asylum claim by him which followed was then  refused,  but
    later having entered into a relationship  with  his  wife  (the  second
    Appellant) he was granted  discretionary  leave  to  remain  from  28th
    November 2011 to 21st October 2012.   This  was  subsequently  extended
    after an in-time application, and the principal Appellant  was  granted
    further discretionary leave from 26th November 2013 until 25th November
    2016.  That leave, however, was curtailed on 6th February 2016  on  the
    basis that the first Appellant should not have been  granted  leave  in
    the manner that he was,  because  such  leave  should  only  have  been
    granted to him in line with that of his wife.   In  the  meantime,  the
    first Appellant built up a business of a restaurant known by  the  name
    of [~] in a small rural town by the name of [~] in [~],  which  is  the
    only Indian restaurant in the entire town.  The first Appellant did  so
    because he had been granted discretionary leave to remain in the United
    Kingdom.

 3. The second Appellant, his wife, had herself entered  the  UK  in  2011.
    She had leave to remain as a student.  This was later varied  to  leave
    to remain as a Tier 4 (Student) until 10th April 2015.  An  application
    was thereafter made in February 2014 for leave to remain on  the  basis
    of private and family life, which  was  refused,  without  a  right  of
    appeal.  On 24th March 2014 an application for leave to remain  outside
    the Rules was submitted but this was refused with no right of appeal.

 4. The third Appellant was born in 2012 and like his parents, is a citizen
    of Bangladesh.  The Appellants'  case  is  that  there  would  be  very
    significant obstacles to their reintegration into life in Bangladesh as
    they have no home to go to, no means of making an income, no family  in
    a financial position to help them, even for a  short  period  of  time.
    The land which they lived on had  belonged  to  the  first  Appellant's
    sisters, and this had been destroyed in the floods, and they no  longer
    had the means to support a family.

 5. The Secretary of State did not  accept  that  the  Appellants  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE.  The judge below who  had  heard  the
    evidence from the first and second Appellants, found them to be honest,
    credible witnesses (see paragraph 35) and it was of great  significance
    in this  case  that  the  first  Appellant  fell  within  the  "Legacy"
    provisions and had later been granted discretionary leave in line  with
    his wife and he could therefore work.  He had trained as a chef and set
    up a business.  Thus, the curtailment of his leave  came  "out  of  the
    blue" (see paragraph 37).

 6. The judge had found there to  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    family returning back to Bangladesh given that they had nowhere to live
    or no means to earn a living; she had found that the removal  would  be
    disproportionate; she had found that the family  were  well  integrated
    into the local community as was shown by the evidence  from  the  local
    people; and  the  first  Appellant  was  self-supporting  and  provided
    employment for eleven British people at his business.  Moreover, one of
    his children had died on the day of being born and was  buried  in  the
    cemetery in the home town, and both  the  first  and  second  Appellant
    regularly visited the cemetery, which they would not be able to  do  if
    they were to be forced to return back to Bangladesh.   The  judge  also
    found that it was  not  reasonable  to  expect  the  Appellants  to  be
    removed, applying the test approved by  Sedley  LJ,  and  finding  that
    there is more than mere hardship that they would suffer. The only issue
    that remained was under Section 117B  and  this  was  to  do  with  the
    maintenance of immigration control (paragraph 52).

 7. The Secretary of State had sought permission to appeal on  the  grounds
    that the judge had erred for two reasons.  First,  she  had  failed  to
    address the weight to be attributed to all the issues and not  just  to
    the Appellants' concern about relocating.  The judge had failed to note
    that the private life of the Appellants had  been  built  up  during  a
    period when their residence  was  precarious.   Second,  there  was  no
    evidence and no reason why, the Appellants could not work and set up  a
    business in Bangladesh, and the judge had failed to consider  that  the
    Appellant could sell or wind up his business and  use  the  profits  to
    assist the family on return.

 8. Judge Rintoul had found that the judge had failed properly  to  explain
    why she had concluded that there were insurmountable obstacles  to  the
    family relocating to Bangladesh.  There was no reason why in  principle
    the assets available in the United Kingdom could not be sold  in  order
    to overcome difficulties on return.  Mr Shah, who had appeared  as  the
    Appellants' representative on that occasion also, had submitted that he
    would accept that if an individual had a substantial sum  of  money  in
    their bank account, then that could clearly be taken  into  account  in
    assessing the overall availability of resources. Furthermore, the judge
    appears to have misunderstood the situation.  Whilst the premises  that
    the first Appellant had were on leasehold, this did not mean  that  the
    business cannot be sold as a going concern or that there was  no  value
    in the lease which was held for fifteen years.

 9. Finally, the judge's findings with respect to Article  8  were  on  the
    basis that the Appellants  met  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  However, the judge's assessment of proportionality was  flawed.
    There were a number of factors in this case which were unusual but  the
    judge failed properly (at paragraph 53) to  set  out  what  weight  she
    attached to the need to maintain immigration control, and what she said
    at paragraph 56 was clearly a misstatement of the law.

10. Judge Rintoul ended his  determination  on  the  basis  that  with  the
    exception of whether or not the  business  could  be  sold,  the  other
    findings of fact were well reasoned and were  to  be  maintained.   The
    learned judge did end with the observation that,

         "I do, however, have concerns about the nature and  timing  of  the
         initial grant of discretionary leave to the first  [Appellant]  and
         for that reason, I direct that the Secretary of State  provide  all
         the contemporaneous notes with regard to that grant, the renewal of
         leave in that capacity and the decision to curtail that leave" (see
         paragraph 12).

The Hearing

11. At the hearing before me on 21st February 2019, Mr Howells, the  Senior
    Home Office Presenting Officer, handed up a bundle of documents,  which
    had been emailed by him also on 18th February 2019 which  set  out  the
    contemporaneous notes for the grant of various periods of leave to  the
    Appellants.   This was in accordance with the direction given by  Judge
    Rintoul for this second stage appeal hearing.

The Hearing

12. At the hearing before me on 21st February 2019, Mr  Shah,  called  both
    the first and second Appellants, as husband and wife, to give  evidence
    again.  The first witness was the first Appellant.   He  confirmed  his
    citizenship as being a national of Bangladesh, and that he was born  on
    20th January 1974.  He had entered the UK illegally in  2003.   He  had
    applied for asylum.  This was refused.  Further submissions  were  made
    in 2011.  This was because he was in  a  relationship  with  a  Tier  4
    Migrant.  As a result, he was subsequently granted discretionary  leave
    between 28th November 2011 and 31st October 2012.  He went  on  to  say
    that although he had a  mother,  two  sisters  and  three  brothers  in
    Bangladesh he could not return back there because no-one would be  able
    to look after him, as  his  family  members  were  poor.   He  had  two
    brothers living in Dubai and they sent  monies  from  there.   His  own
    mother lived with his sister-in-law.  He would contact  his  mother  on
    the telephone and stayed in touch with them.  He  went  on  to  confirm
    that he ran an Indian restaurant which employed eleven local staff  and
    four other Bengali staff.  This was in [~] in  Somerset.   It  was  the
    only Indian restaurant in  the  town.   He  had  plans  to  expand  the
    restaurant because it was so busy.  However, he could not do so if  his
    immigration status was on hold.  He was asked why he could not go back.
     He said that one of his children was buried in the local cemetery.  He
    could not leave him and go back.  The other  reason  was  that  he  had
    spent the best part of his life in the UK building up a  business  from
    scratch, had invested heavily, and could not give this up on the chance
    of being able to set up a business in Bangladesh.

13. In cross-examination he went on to confirm that he had some �25,000  to
    �30,000 in his business account.  He took a salary per month  from  the
    turnover.  The lease of the business is due to  expire  in  2024.   His
    eldest son was well established in school.  His  primary  language  was
    English.  He had local friends.  He could not uproot himself and go  to
    Bangladesh.  He was asked about the letters (at pages 24 to 27) written
    by [MS], by [AL], and by [HS].  They had all referred to  the  business
    in a letter which was,  however,  written  in  identical  terms.   This
    stated that [~] was a small and rich English heritage village where  it
    was extremely difficult to find local staff.  The witnesses  who  wrote
    on behalf of the Appellant supporting him stated that they work at  the
    restaurant, with a number of local staff, and that the first  Appellant
    was the main chef in the kitchen and he was assisted by  others.   They
    explained that this was a very popular restaurant.  Everyone living  in
    and around  [~]  visited.   Most  customers  are  very  happy  and  the
    restaurant needs to  expand  because  it  cannot  accommodate  all  the
    customers.  When the first Appellant was asked why these  letters  were
    all in identical  terms,  he  explained  that  he  had  got  his  staff
    together, and explained to them the predicament he was in, and they had
    asked him how they could help him.  Then one of the staff members,  who
    was a student, volunteered to write a uniform  letter,  expressing  the
    staff's support for the restaurant and for  the  first  Appellant,  and
    this was then signed off by everybody else.  These were  not,  however,
    the words of the first Appellant himself.

14. There was no cross-examination.

15. The second witness was the first Appellant's wife.   She  also  adopted
    her witness statement (pages 24 to 26) dated 21st February  2019.   She
    confirmed she was born on 25th June 1992.  She arrived  in  the  UK  on
    10th January 2011 as a student.  Her student visa was valid  from  23rd
    January 2011 until 31st October 2012.   In  her  evidence-in-chief  she
    went on to say that she and her family are fully  integrated  into  the
    local community.  So much so, that the children of her staff invite her
    children to their homes.  They meet with local residents at  Christmas-
    time, when they are invited into their homes, and they are also invited
    for birthdays.  She said that she had a business background and she had
    used that to support her  husband  to  establish  a  business  in  this
    country.  The two of them had worked very hard together.

16. She said everyone in [~] really loved them as a family and they in turn
    loved the people there.  This town  was  now  their  home.   They  were
    settled here.  They could not go back.  When asked why they  could  not
    go back, she replied that,

         "It would be a real shame.  This is because my husband has built  a
         business here.  We have lots of friends.  They're like close family
         members.  I wanted to do an MBA and to become  an  accountant,  and
         had the immigration situation been better I would have completed my
         studies.  I feel ashamed when my friends ask  me  why  I  have  not
         completed my studies as I have only four subjects to complete and I
         would then be a certified accountant".

    She drew attention to the letter of 27th May 2015  (at  page  80)  that
    confirms the four subjects she has yet to complete.

17. In cross-examination she confirmed that she had a father and stepmother
    in Bangladesh.  She last visited in 2011.  She believed that she  would
    get another extension of stay and this is why both she and her  husband
    had invested in the business.  They had not  acted  illegally  in  this
    regard.  When asked how she had spent �20,000  on  her  education,  she
    said that her husband had borrowed money.  He had also  worked  in  the
    restaurant.  She herself had worked in  a  factory.   Cumulatively  the
    funds had been raised in order to enable her to study.

18. There was no re-examination.

19. In his closing speech, Mr Howells relied upon  the  refusal  letter  of
    29th  June  2018.   He  submitted  that  the  crucial  issue  was   the
    application of paragraph 276ADE, and whether  the  Appellants'  private
    life was such as to make it disproportionate for them to return.  There
    was no qualifying child and so the Appellants could not  succeed  under
    paragraph 276ADE(iv).  There were also no insurmountable obstacles  and
    so  they  could  not  succeed  under   paragraph   276ADE(vi)   either.
    Importantly, my attention was drawn to the case  of  Treebhawon  [2017]
    UKUT 13 where Mr Justice McCloskey had summarised the two limbs of  the
    test that had to be satisfied under paragraph 276ADE.   The  first  was
    the issue of "integration".  The second was the issue of whether  there
    were  "very  significant  obstacles".   On  the  former  question,  the
    decision in Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813 was decisive in holding that the
    idea of integration calls for a "broad evaluative judgment to  be  made
    as to whether the individual will be enough of an insider in  terms  of
    understanding how life in the society in that country is carried on and
    a capacity to participate in it".  In relation to the latter  question,
    namely whether there were "very significant obstacles" this was a "self-
    evidently elevated threshold" (see paragraph 37 of Treebhawon) so  that
    "mere hardship, mere difficulty, mere  hurdles  and  mere  upheaval  or
    inconvenience, even when multiplied, will generally be insufficient  in
    this context".  As Justice McCloskey  explained,  "the  philosophy  and
    reasoning, with  appropriate  adjustments,  of  this  Tribunal  in  its
    exposition of the sister test of 'unduly harsh' in  MK  (Sierra  Leone)
    [2015] UKUT 223 applies"(at paragraph 46).

20. Finally, there was the question of Article 8.  If the Appellants do not
    succeed under the Rules, then  Section  117B  applied  and  the  public
    interest  in  immigration   control   would   be   a   very   important
    consideration.  In this  case,  the  first  Appellant  established  his
    business  even  before  he  had  been  erroneously  granted  a  further
    extension of stay (and it  was  erroneous  because  the  further  grant
    should only have been commensurate with the grant given  to  his  wife,
    and not beyond that).  The Appellant should not have taken the risk  of
    starting a business.  He should not be given the benefit of  Article  8
    rights  created  when  his  immigration  status  was  precarious.   The
    evidence showed that he had �25,000 to �30,000 available and  he  could
    relocate with that to Bangladesh.  The Rules were  clear  that  "little
    weight" should be granted to the creation of private life rights  where
    one's immigration status is precarious.  As for  the  position  of  the
    children, Section 55 of the BCIA 2009, would not assist  the  children,
    because they were young enough  to  go  as  a  single  family  unit  to
    Bangladesh with their parents, particularly as none  of  them  had  any
    health problems, and none of them were qualifying children.

21. In his closing submission,  Mr  Shah  submitted  that  there  were  two
    important considerations in this case.  First, there was the error made
    by the Secretary  of  State  herself.   At  the  hearing  before  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Rintoul, the Respondent had to make an apology  for  the
    fact that an erroneous grant of further extension of stay was  made  to
    the first Appellant, during which time he had  built  up  private  life
    rights, and without there being  any  explanation.   Moreover,  it  had
    taken two years for the Secretary of State  to  correct  any  mistakes.
    Second, the plain fact was that there was in fact no error  at  all  in
    the  grant  of  further  extension  of  stay.   This  was  a   complete
    misconception. This is because the Appellant himself  had  applied  for
    asylum initially.  His case had subsequently  fallen  into  the  Legacy
    Scheme.  This was recognised both by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  and
    by Mr Rintoul.  As a consequence of that, when a decision was  made  to
    grant him discretionary leave, it was on the basis of his asylum claim.
    It came to be decided, for this reason, under the Legacy Scheme.  There
    was no indication in the documentation that the grant of Leave  to  him
    was actually on the basis of his wife having been granted further leave
    to stay.  Since that was in fact the case, the Secretary of  State  was
    wrong to have revoked that grant of stay  on  the  basis  that  it  was
    erroneous in the first place, because it was never linked to the  grant
    of his wife's extension of stay. It was entirely to do with his  asylum
    application and his case falling under the Legacy Scheme. This is  why,
    submitted Mr Shah, it is that case that the  Appellant  himself  states
    (at page 18 of the bundle) that he was  "shocked"  to  learn  that  his
    grant of leave had been revoked. Nor  was  it  the  case  that  he  had
    started his business at a time when he had no grant of leave so  as  to
    leave him in a precarious immigration position.  On the contrary,  this
    was a case where the Appellant had been  granted  an  additional  three
    years' leave to remain,  and  that  leave  expired  in  2016,  and  the
    Appellant started his business only  at  the  beginning  of  2015.   It
    cannot be said that he had actually jumped  the  gun  and  started  his
    business before he had been granted an extension of stay.  Finally,  in
    terms of proportionality, the balance of considerations  fell  entirely
    in his favour and it would now be disproportionate to  remove  him  and
    his family back to Bangladesh.  He asked me to allow the appeal.

Reasons for Decision

22. I have given careful consideration to all the evidence before  me,  the
    submissions that have been made, and the further documentation that has
    been produced.  I find that the  Appellants  discharge  the  burden  of
    proof that is upon them for the following reasons.  I  begin  with  the
    additional documentation that has been produced by  Mr  Howells,  as  a
    result of the directions given by Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul on  18th
    September 2018.

23. First, there is an application made on 26th October 2012.  It is an in-
    time application (see page 4 of the eight page bundle  produced  by  Mr
    Howells).  It confirms that there are no criminal  convictions.   There
    is no adverse information.  It is in relation to that application  that
    it was decided on 27th November  2013  that  the  Appellant  is  to  be
    granted discretionary leave "in  line  with  applicant's  partner's  T4
    leave on code 1A until 10th April 2015" (see page 6).  There is then an
    entry on 3rd December 2015 to the effect that "leave was granted on the
    basis of relationship with [the Appellant's wife], and as her leave has
    expired and further application been  refused,  certified  decision  to
    curtail was correct".

24. Second, however, be that as it may, I am satisfied that this is not the
    proper reading of what has actually transpired.  What has  happened  is
    that the first Appellant was a failed asylum  seeker.   This  is  clear
    from Mr Howells' email of 18th February 2019.  This refers to the  very
    first grant of discretionary leave to the first Appellant (see pages  1
    to 3) which was dated 29th November 2011.  It makes it clear that "[The
    Appellant] is a failed asylum seeker".  He has provided a copy  of  his
    wife's student visa and the Home Office records confirm that  "she  has
    leave to remain in the UK until 21st October 2011.  It is accepted that
    [the Appellant] has family in the UK" (see page 1).

25. Third, if one now looks at the decision letter of the Respondent, dated
    28th November 2011, this is headed "Determination of Asylum Claim".  It
    clearly refers to the historic asylum Legacy cases.  It makes it  clear
    that,

         "Your client's further submissions have been  carefully  considered
         within the UK Border Agency of the Home Office, and a decision  has
         been taken that it would be appropriate, because of the  particular
         circumstances of your client's case, to grant him leave  to  remain
         in  the  United  Kingdom  on  a  discretionary  basis  outside  the
         Immigration Rules for a specified period".  (See  page  34  of  the
         Appellant's bundle).

26. On this basis, the first Appellant was then actually given a  residence
    permit (which appears at page 35 of the bundle)  and  this  grants  him
    "leave to remain" and is also certified as "work permitted".  Given the
    heading of this documentation, and its reference to the "asylum claim",
    it is  clear  that  this  grant  of  discretionary  leave  had  nothing
    whatsoever to do with the Appellant's  wife's  grant  of  discretionary
    leave.

27. Fourth, if one then turns to  the  Appellant's  witness  statement  (at
    pages 17 to 23), it is plain that he makes it clear  that  on  3rd  May
    2007, his representatives at the time  "requested  consideration  under
    the Legacy Scheme as I was  a  failed  asylum  seeker"  (paragraph  3).
    Although, the Appellant's Legacy application was refused  by  the  Home
    Office in a standard rejection letter of  11th  February  2011,  as  he
    explains in his Witness  Statement,  he  was  on  26th  November  2013,
    granted three years' discretionary leave to remain until 25th  November
    2016.

28. Fifth, it was only subsequently thereafter, that  the  Appellant  then,
    however, received a letter from the Respondent on  3rd  December  2015,
    informing him that his leave was curtailed.  But this was on the  basis
    that his wife's visa had expired and she was not  granted  any  further
    leave.  His leave was therefore also  curtailed,  and  he  was  granted
    leave to remain until 6th February 2016.  As he states in  his  Witness
    Statement, "I was shocked by the Respondent's letter as I assumed  that
    I was granted leave to remain on my own right as my leave  was  granted
    for three years and my wife who submitted a  separate  application  was
    granted two and a half years" (emphases added).

29. Sixth, the result is, as the Appellant himself explains, that the grant
    of discretionary leave to him could not have been on the basis  of  the
    grant to his wife.  This is because of the longer period being  granted
    to him, as opposed to what was granted to his wife. The two  grants  of
    leave are not the same.  His grant of leave could also  not  have  been
    linked to his wife's case because he had  been  granted  an  extra  six
    months compared to what his wife  had  been  granted.   He  had  always
    assumed that he had been granted leave on the basis of  his  length  of
    residence in the UK since the year 2003.  He appears to have been right
    in that assumption.  As he explains in his Witness Statement, "I am the
    victim of the Respondent's decision and as a result  of  being  granted
    three  years'  leave  I  purchased  a  leasehold   Indian   restaurant"
    (paragraph 5).  He further adds that  his  legal  representatives  also
    explained that he had been granted leave to remain "on my own right and
    not on the basis of my wife" (paragraph 6).

30. On this basis, when the Respondent Secretary of State then wrote to the
    first Appellant on 26th November 2013 (see page 31 of the bundle), this
    was in relation to the Appellant's application for an extension of stay
    that had followed on from the grant  of  discretionary  leave  on  28th
    November 2011.  In that regard, it was now being said to him that,

         "I am writing to inform you that, although you do not  qualify  for
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom under the Immigration  Rules,
         it has nonetheless been decided that discretion should be exercised
         in your favour.  You have therefore been granted limited  leave  to
         remain in the United Kingdom in accordance with the principles  set
         out in the Home Office policy instruction on  discretionary  leave.
         You have been granted discretionary  leave  to  remain  until  25th
         November 2016".

31. The first Appellant gave evidence before me that he  did  not  purchase
    the lease of his business until in early 2015. By  that  stage  he  had
    been granted a further discretionary leave to remain.  That aside, what
    is interesting about the latest letter of 26th November 2013,  however,
    is that it refers to the grant of discretionary  leave  "in  accordance
    with the principles set out in the Home Office  policy  instruction  on
    discretionary leave".

32. If one now has a look at that policy (see page 142 of  the  Appellant's
    bundle) it refers to "transitional arrangements", and makes  the  point
    that all decisions made on discretionary leave on  or  after  9th  July
    2012 will be subject to the criteria set out in this guidance.  It then
    goes on to say that, with respect to applicants  granted  discretionary
    leave before 9th July 2012, which was the Appellant's position,  "those
    who come up before 9th July 2012, have been granted leave under the  DL
    policy in force at the time will normally continue  to  be  dealt  with
    under that  policy  through  to  settlement  if  they  qualify  for  it
    (normally after accruing six years' continuous DL)".

33. Accordingly, under this previous policy in  relation  to  discretionary
    leave to remain, the Appellant was well on his  way  to  being  granted
    permanent settlement after six years of discretionary leave  to  remain
    in this country.  It was  for  this  reason  that  in  the  Appellants'
    written submissions (which appear at the start  of  their  bundle)  (at
    page 2), the point is made that "it was unreasonable for the Respondent
    to curtail the Appellant's three years' discretionary leave to remain".



34. This was because if regard is had to "the chronology  of  events",  the
    Appellant submitted a separate  leave  to  remain  application  to  the
    Respondent on 24th October 2012 and he was granted three  years'  leave
    to remain from 26th November 2013 until 25th  November  2016.  On  that
    basis, I agree as the Appellant argues that, "it was  unreasonable  for
    the Respondent to send a letter  to  the  principal  Appellant  on  3rd
    December 2015 informing him that his leave was curtailed on  the  basis
    that his wife's visa had expired and she was not  granted  any  further
    leave".

35.  The  Appellant  had  assumed  that  he  was   granted   three   years'
    discretionary leave in his own right. The Respondent's decision  letter
    of 26th November 2013 did not state that he was granted  leave  on  the
    basis of his wife.  The written submissions go on to say that,

         "As a result of the Respondent's error the  Appellant  purchased  a
         leasehold Indian restaurant business.  Clearly the Appellant was  a
         victim in the hands of the Respondent.  It is  requested  that  the
         court exercises its discretion and grant the Appellant three years'
         discretionary leave under the  old  Immigration  Rules"  (page  2).



36. For all these reasons, this appeal is allowed on the basis that if  the
    principles  of  "integration"  and  "very  significant  obstacles"  are
    applied, then  the  Appellant  succeeds,  given  what  was  decided  in
    Treebhawon, and particularly as there is no Section 117B  consideration
    that militates against the Appellants on account of any public interest
    in favour of immigration control requiring  their  removal.    This  is
    because as far as the latter is  concerned,  the  appellants,  I  find,
    would face 'very significant  obstacles'  to  their  re-integration  in
    Bangladesh  such  that  they  satisfy  the  requirements  of  para  276
    ADE(1)(vi), given that the Court of Appeal has given guidance in Kamara
    [2016] EWCA Civ 813 (at para 14) that "the idea of 'integration'  calls
    for a broad evaluative judgment to be made as to whether the individual
    will be enough of an insider in terms of understanding how life in  the
    society in that country is carried on and a capacity to participate  in
    it...".  On the facts of  this  case,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellants will be enough of 'insiders' or able to 'participate' in the
    life society in Bangladesh given that they have lost their home  there,
    and given all the other matters set out above.  But more important than
    that,  I  find  that  there  are  'exceptional  circumstances'  to  the
    appellants' claim, if the claim is  assessed  outside  the  immigration
    rules.

37. This is because as the decision in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 1 explains, "the
    European Court's use of the phrase 'exceptional circumstances' in  this
    context was considered by the Court of Appeal in  MF  (Nigeria)  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 1192 (paragraph 56).  The Supreme Court goes on to say that,

         "Ultimately, it has to decide whether the refusal is  proportionate
         in the particular case before it, balancing  the  strength  of  the
         public interest in the removal of the person  in  question  against
         the impact on private and family life.  In doing so, it should give
         appropriate weight to the Secretary of State's policy, expressed in
         the Rules and instructions, that the public interest in immigration
         control can be outweighed,  when  considering  an  application  for
         leave to remain brought by a person in the  UK  in  breach  of  the
         Immigration Rules, only where there are 'insurmountable  obstacles'
         or 'exceptional circumstances' as defined." (Paragraph 57).

38. The Supreme Court provides helpful guidance when  it  goes  on  to  say
    that,

         "The Secretary of State has not imposed a test of exceptionality in
         the sense that the case should exhibit some highly unusual feature,
         over and above the application of the test of proportionality.   On
         the contrary, she had defined the word  'exceptional',  as  already
         explained, as meaning circumstances in which refusal  would  result
         in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the  individual  such  that
         the  refusal  of  the  application  would  not  be  proportionate."
         (Paragraph 60).

39. I am satisfied that the Appellants can discharge the  burden  of  proof
    that is upon them because it would be  unjustifiably  harsh  to  expect
    them to return back to Bangladesh given the facts that I have  accepted
    above. The first Appellant did not remain here illegally.  He  did  not
    start his business when his  leave  was  precarious.   And,  the  leave
    granted to him was under the Legacy Scheme such that it  ought  not  to
    have been subsequently curtailed.  The Article 8 rights  in  this  case
    have been built up in that context. To suggest that  they  return  back
    would suggest a disproportionality in such a course of action.  Section
    117B expresses the public interest in immigration control but  for  the
    reasons set out above it should not be given the controlling weight  as
    a consideration that is normally given to it in this case. Accordingly,
    this appeal is allowed.

40. An anonymity direction is made.

41. This appeal is allowed.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
