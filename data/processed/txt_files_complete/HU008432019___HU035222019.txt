For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND

    1. The Appellants appeal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
       T Lawrence promulgated on 24 July 2019  ("the  Decision")  dismissing
       their appeals.  The First and Second Appellants are husband and wife.
        The First Appellant appeals against the Respondent's decision  dated
       20 December 2018 refusing his human rights claim made in the  context
       of a refusal of indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)
       Migrant.  The  Second  Appellant  appeals  against  the  Respondent's
       decision dated 7 February 2019 refusing her human rights claim in the
       context of a refusal of leave to remain  based  on  her  relationship
       with the First Appellants.

    2. The Respondent refused the First Appellant indefinite leave to remain
       on the basis that there were discrepancies between the amount of self-
       employed earnings which he had declared in applications made  to  her
       in 2011 and 2013 when compared with the earnings declared to HMRC  in
       the same periods.  The Respondent therefore refused the human  rights
       claim  on  suitability  grounds,  and  because  there  were  no  very
       significant obstacles to the First Appellant's integration in  India.
       She refused the Second Appellant's  application  on  the  basis  that
       family life could be continued in the couple's home country and there
       were no very significant obstacles to her integration in India.

    3.  The  Judge  refused  an  application  by  the  Appellants   for   an
       adjournment.  The Second Appellant was said to be  unable  to  attend
       because the couple's children were unwell.  It was also said that the
       First Appellant's accountant had intended to attend  the  hearing  to
       give evidence but was unable to do so due to a family emergency.  The
       Judge found that the First Appellant had  acted  dishonestly  in  his
       declarations of income and therefore could not meet  the  Immigration
       Rules on grounds of suitability.  He also agreed that there  were  no
       very significant obstacles to either of the  Appellants'  integration
       in their home country and that family life could continue there.   He
       considered the best interests of the couple's two children but  found
       that those were met by remaining with their  parents.   The  children
       were aged one and two years respectively.   For  those  reasons,  the
       Judge dismissed the appeals.

    4. The Appellants appealed on a number of grounds including in  relation
       to the Judge's treatment of the adjournment request and some  of  the
       findings made by him.

    5. Permission to appeal was refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Chohan
       on 9 October 2019 in the following terms:

           "... 2.     The grounds assert that the judge erred  in  failing
           to consider the full facts and  evidence  in  the  case  and  by
           refusing an adjournment request.

           3.    Contrary to what is stated in the grounds, the  judge  did
           consider carefully the facts and evidence and the findings  made
           were open to the  judge.   Adequate  reasons  have  been  given.
           Furthermore, the judge has given adequate reasons  for  refusing
           the adjournment request.

           4.    The grounds are a disagreement with the  judge's  findings
           and nothing more.  There is no arguable error of law."

    6. The Appellants renewed their application for permission to appeal  to
       this Tribunal.  On 7 November 2019,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Blundell
       granted permission in the following terms:

           "... This is an earnings  discrepancy  case.   The  grounds  are
           lengthy but they may be  grouped  under  three  heads.   By  the
           first, it is submitted that the judge's refusal to  adjourn  was
           unfair.  By the second, it is submitted that the judge failed to
           take material matters into  account  in  resolving  the  central
           issue of deception against the first appellant.  By  the  third,
           it is submitted that the judge's  decision  on  Article  8  ECHR
           grounds was legally  erroneous,  although  it  seems  that  this
           ground essentially repeats the first.

           I consider it arguable that the judge's refusal to  adjourn  was
           unfair (AM (Somalia) [2019] 4  All  ER  714  refers,  at  [56]).
           Whilst he directed himself to the over-riding objective at [18],
           he did not direct himself to rule 28 and he  considered  whether
           the absence of the second appellant  furnished  a  "sufficiently
           compelling" reason to adjourn, rather than assessing whether  it
           was in the interests of justice to proceed in her absence.   Nor
           did the judge consider whether the hearing could proceed  fairly
           in the absence of the  first  appellant's  accountant.   In  the
           circumstances, ground one is arguable.  It follows  that  ground
           three may also be argued, although it is not clear to me how  it
           takes matters any further.

           Ground  two  is  decidedly  less  meritorious.   The  challenges
           therein presented are actually expressed as disagreements  on  a
           number of occasions and may well be thought to amount to nothing
           more than that.  Nevertheless, I grant permission on this ground
           because of my decision on ground one."

    7. The matter comes before me to consider whether the Decision  contains
       a material error of law and if I conclude that it does, either to re-
       make the decision or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  for
       redetermination.

   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

    8. The focus of the submissions made, as the permission  grant,  is  the
       Judge's refusal to adjourn to allow the Second  Appellant  to  attend
       and give evidence and for the  First  Appellant's  accountant  to  do
       likewise.

    9. The Judge dealt with the adjournment request at [16] to [18]  of  the
       Decision as follows:

           "16.  Mr Hussain made an application to adjourn the hearing as a
           preliminary issue, on two grounds.  The first was that Appellant
           2 was unable to attend because her children  had  been  slightly
           unwell; no alternative childcare was available, and  she  should
           be able to attend the hearing of her appeal.  The second  ground
           was that Appellant 1's accountant had been due to  appear  as  a
           witness, which was considered to be essential.   The  accountant
           had informed the Appellants on the day before the  hearing  that
           he had needed to travel on that day by airplane to attend  to  a
           family emergency, but that he would be prepared to give evidence
           for them on a later date.

           17.   Mr Mavrantonis opposed the application on the grounds that
           the Appellants had known about the hearing for  months  and  the
           hearing should not be rearranged around the availability of  the
           accountant.  Also,  there  was  no  evidence  supporting  either
           ground and Appellant 2's appeal was  completely  dependent  upon
           Appellant 1's appeal.

           18.   I refused the adjournment for the  following  reasons.   I
           had regard to the overriding objective in the Tribunal Procedure
           (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
           2014 to enable the  Tribunal  to  deal  with  cases  fairly  and
           justly, which includes dealing with the case in ways  which  are
           proportionate to the importance of the case, the  complexity  of
           the issues, the anticipated  costs  and  the  resources  of  the
           parties  and  of  the  Tribunal;  seeking  flexibility  in   the
           proceedings; ensuring so far as practicable,  that  the  parties
           are able to participate fully in the proceedings;  and  avoiding
           delay, so far as compatible with  proper  consideration  of  the
           issues.  With those considerations in mind,  the  attendance  of
           Appellant 2 as an observer only was not a sufficient  compelling
           reason to delay the appeal given that she was not to  be  called
           as a  witness  and  Appellant  1  and  his  representative  were
           attending and could report back to her on the  proceedings.   In
           relation to the accountant, there had been  no  indication  that
           the accountant was due to attend, and no witness  statement  had
           been submitted for him, which was not capable of being explained
           by the claimed emergency that had  arisen  the  day  before  the
           hearing that it was now said it was necessary for him to  attend
           to give evidence at a hearing that had been listed  some  months
           in advance."

   10. Mr Hussain accepted that there was not  a  witness  statement  before
       Judge Lawrence, either from the Second Appellant or  the  accountant.
       He said that it was proposed to take a handwritten statement from the
       Second Appellant on the morning of the hearing and to file it at  the
       hearing.  The accountant had wished to draft his own statement  as  a
       professional and would have brought that along to the hearing  if  he
       had attended.  Mr Hussain accepted that no such  statement  had  been
       obtained subsequently from either witness.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
       had given directions on 23 January 2019 for the  filing  of  evidence
       "as soon as ..available" and there was no explanation for the failure
       to produce such evidence sooner.  There was no application before  me
       to adduce any further evidence to explain that failure or expand upon
       either the reasons for the inability to attend or what  evidence  the
       witnesses would have given.  Mr Hussain  said  that  the  Appellants'
       children's illness was  one  for  which  medical  attention  was  not
       required and therefore there was no  medical  evidence  available  in
       that regard.  The accountant had not provided any evidence about what
       was said to be his family emergency.

   11. Mr Hussain fairly accepted that there was a distinction to  be  drawn
       between the implications of the Second Appellant's absence  and  that
       of the accountant.  The Second Appellant could only give evidence  as
       to the couple's Article 8 rights and  that  was  evidence  which  the
       First Appellant could himself give.  That  is  not  to  belittle  the
       Second Appellant's wish to attend the hearing of an appeal  to  which
       she was a party but, as the Judge noted  at  [18]  her  inability  to
       attend was not of itself good reason to delay  for  that  reason.  It
       cannot sensibly be suggested that the refusal to adjourn  on  account
       of her position was unfair to the Appellants (particularly given  the
       lack of any witness  statement  from  the  Second  Appellant  at  the
       relevant time or since).

   12. I turn then to the position as regards the  accountant.   This  is  a
       case  in  which  the  Respondent  had  taken  issue  with  the  First
       Appellant's earnings due to discrepancies between income declared  to
       HMRC and that declared to  Home  Office.   I  accept  therefore  that
       evidence which the accountant could give might have more relevance.

   13. However, the evidence has to be considered in light of  the  evidence
       that the accountant had already produced (in the form  of  a  letter)
       and  the  explanation  which  the  First  Appellant  gave   for   the
       discrepancies.  Dealing  first  with  the  letter,  that  appears  at
       [AB/24] and is dated 1 July 2019.  It reads as follows:

           "We can confirm that we act for the above named  client  in  our
           capacity as his accountant and business advisors.

           We write this letter to clarify a few points, especially the way
           that income has been shown to the Home Office for HSMP  purposes
           and then presented on a Tax Return to HMRC (Inland Revenue).  As
           you  can  appreciate  our  client  was  self-employed  and   the
           information and the dates that the  Home  Office  require  under
           their rules and regulation are not and have never been  in  line
           with the rules and regulations of HMRC.

           Therefore the information will vary from what  was  declared  to
           the Home Office and that declared to HMRC.  For example the Home
           Office require information  from  one  day  to  another  one  in
           accordance  with  the  client's  application,  whilst  HMRC  are
           interested in the financial year of 6th April to  the  following
           year 5th April.

           It will be near  impossible  and  especially  without  the  full
           information to be  able  reconcile  the  income  shown  to  both
           institutes.   Therefore  we  recommend   that   you   read   the
           information independent of each other.

           We also like to mention client amended his 2010-11 tax return on
           22nd March 2012 by one of his friend because client  shared  his
           thoughts with his friend  that  he  might  forgot  to  add  more
           expenses which he incurred in business after 15th March 2011 and
           before 31st March 2011.  His friend  submitted  his  tax  return
           without consulting us.   That  was  reflecting  on  his  2010-11
           amended tax return.

           Client approached us now to review his 2010-11 tax  return.   We
           will go through again client's 2010-11 tax return  and  will  do
           necessary action if it's need to take.

           Please  feel  free  to  contact  us  if  you  need  any  further
           information."

   14. A number of points can be made about that letter.   First,  as  there
       appears, the amended  tax  return  (which  was  relied  upon  by  the
       Respondent) was  not  amended  by  the  accountants  at  all.   As  I
       understood Mr Hussain's submissions and the Appellant's evidence  (in
       particular [7] at [AB/22]), the  amended  tax  return  on  which  the
       Respondent relied was amended by the  First  Appellant  and  not  the
       accountant so it is difficult to see  what  evidence  the  accountant
       could supply.  Second, it follows  from  this  that  the  explanation
       given for the amendment must come from the First  Appellant  himself.
       He could therefore give that evidence  (and  did:  see  [33]  of  the
       Decision).  Third, the accountant's letter makes no  mention  of  the
       later tax return on which reliance  was  also  placed.   Fourth,  the
       letter makes no attempt to explain the  discrepancies.   Indeed,  the
       accountant says that it would be "near impossible" to carry  out  any
       reconciliation.  Fifth, and crucially, the letter  does  not  suggest
       that the accountant was proposing to provide  any  further  evidence.
       He says that he would be reviewing the earlier tax return.   However,
       that  is  not  said  to  be  for  the  purposes  of  explaining   the
       discrepancies or providing any evidence about it.   As  I  read  that
       paragraph, the suggestion is that the  accountant  was  proposing  to
       carry out the review as an accountant, presumably to check  that  the
       appropriate tax had been paid and that the amendment was justified.

   15. I accept, as did Mr Lindsay, that the Judge has not made any  express
       reference to the case of Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014]  UKUT
       00418 (IAC).  The guidance there given is as follows:

           "If a Tribunal refuses to accede to an adjournment request, such
           decision could, in principle, be erroneous  in  law  in  several
           respects: these include a  failure  to  take  into  account  all
           material considerations; permitting immaterial considerations to
           intrude; denying the party concerned a fair hearing; failing  to
           apply the correct test; and acting irrationally.   In  practice,
           in most cases the question will be whether the refusal  deprived
           the affected party of his right to a  fair  hearing.   Where  an
           adjournment refusal is challenged on  fairness  grounds,  it  is
           important to recognise that the question for the Upper  Tribunal
           is not whether the FtT acted reasonably.  Rather, the test to be
           applied is that of fairness:  was there any deprivation  of  the
           affected party's right to a fair hearing? See SH (Afghanistan) v
           Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2011]  EWCA  Civ
           1284."

   16. I accept that the central question for me is whether  the  Appellants
       have been deprived  of  a  fair  hearing.   However,  as  Mr  Lindsay
       submitted, the prior question and the issue raised by the  Appellants
       is whether the Judge has applied the right test.  In that regard, the
       Judge had regard to the overriding objective and the need to  conduct
       the hearing fairly and justly.  Mr  Lindsay  also  submitted,  and  I
       accept that this also answers the point which found favour with Judge
       Blundell concerning rule 28 of  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
       Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014.  That concerns
       a Judge's decision to proceed in the absence of a party.  He/she must
       be satisfied that the absent party has notice of the hearing (or that
       all reasonable steps have been taken to notify) which does not  apply
       here as the First Appellant attended and the Second Appellant is  his
       wife.  The second sub-requirement is whether it is in  the  interests
       of justice to proceed with  the  hearing  in  that  party's  absence.
       Although no reference is made to rule 28, the approach taken  by  the
       Judge is consistent with that rule.  Whilst he may not  have  adopted
       that precise wording (and the reference to  "sufficiently  compelling
       reason to delay" is perhaps unfortunate), I  am  satisfied  that  his
       broad approach was correct.   In any event,  as  regards  the  Second
       Appellant, for the reasons I have already given, I do not accept that
       her absence deprived the Appellants of a fair hearing.

   17. Neither do I accept that the Judge  has  erred  in  relation  to  the
       accountant's absence.  As  the  Judge  points  out  at  [18]  of  the
       Decision, there was never any indication that the accountant was  due
       to attend nor any witness statement from him or  evidence  about  the
       emergency which is said to have affected his ability  to  attend  (or
       indeed that he had intended to attend absent that  emergency).   Even
       now such evidence is lacking.  I have already set out at [14]  above,
       why the evidence of the accountant was not in any event  central  (at
       least in the form in which it then and now appears).

   18. Moreover, the accountant's evidence needs to be considered  alongside
       the findings made.   Since those findings form the  basis  of  ground
       two, and although Judge Blundell found that  ground  "decidedly  less
       meritorious", I set those findings out  below  in  order  to  provide
       context:

           "33.  I first consider the allegation of dishonesty relating  to
           the admitted discrepancies between the earnings that Appellant 1
           had claimed in his  28  March  2011  application  as  a  Tier  1
           (General) migrant and information provided to the Respondent  by
           Her Majesty's Revenue and  Customs  (HMRC)  for  the  tax  years
           ending in April 2010 and April 2011:

           33.1  Appellant 1's claim is that he had made an honest  mistake
           in omitting to account for allowable expenses  in  his  original
           declaration to HMRC.   Appellant  1  explained  in  his  witness
           statement that he subsequently amended the  declaration  because
           naively he 'never thought, as a layman, that  the  expenses  for
           business needed to  be  added'.   That  explanation  is  however
           undermined by his statement in oral evidence that  the  original
           declaration  had  been  prepared  with  the  assistance  of  the
           professional accountants who provided a  letter  supporting  the
           2013 application to the  Respondent  and  who  have  provided  a
           letter dated 1 July 2019 in relation to the discrepancy  in  the
           2011 declarations.

           33.2  The accountants in the  1  July  2019  letter  state  that
           Appellant 1 had been advised by a friend who  had  submitted  an
           amended declaration to HMRC, and  that  claim  was  repeated  by
           Appellant 1 in his oral evidence.  Appellant 1 further stated in
           oral evidence that the friend had had accountancy experience and
           qualifications and, when discussing the matter with the  friend,
           Appellant 1 had come  to  realise  that  there  were  additional
           expenses he could  have  claimed  for  travel  and  hotels  when
           travelling in relation to unsuccessful attempts  to  obtain  new
           business.

           33.3  HMRC confirm that the adjustment of taxable  self-employed
           earnings was not in relation to turnover,  which  is  consistent
           with  Appellant's  1's  explanation  that  the  reason  for  the
           adjustment was a late realisation that his tax liability  should
           have been reduced  by  is  allowable  expenses.   However,  that
           explanation is not  supported  by  a  copy  of  the  tax  return
           calculations and/or accounts, let  alone  any  evidence  of  the
           expenses that [he] claims to have neglected  to  incorporate  in
           his original tax  declaration  to  HMRC,  nor  has  Appellant  1
           provided a statement by the friend he claimed in  oral  evidence
           had assisted him in his late realisation that  he  could  reduce
           his tax liability in that way, still less any appearance by  the
           friend as a witness, and that claim is undermined by his account
           of having been assisted by professional  accountants  to  submit
           the original declaration.

           34.   I next consider the allegation of dishonesty  relating  to
           the admitted discrepancies between the earnings that Appellant 1
           claimed in his 20 April 2013 application as a Tier  1  (General)
           migrant and information provided to the Respondent by  HMRC  for
           the tax year ending in April 2013.

           34.1  Appellant 1 had claimed in the 30 April  2013  application
           to have received �37,252.02  in  earnings  from  self-employment
           between 7 April 2012 and 6 April 2013, of which  �22,695.14  was
           earned through employment with ASDA Stores Ltd and  �14,543  was
           net profit from self-employment.

           34.2  HMRC had however informed the Respondent that Appellant  1
           had declared �10,370 self-employment income  for  the  tax  year
           ending April 2013.  That lower amount,  added  to  the  earnings
           from employment, gave a total of �33,065.14,  which  would  have
           reduced  the  points  awarded  to  the  Appellant  for  previous
           earnings by 5 points, bringing him below the  number  of  points
           required to warrant a  grant  of  leave  lto  remain  under  the
           relevant category within the Immigration Rules.

           34.3  The accountant's letter  dated  29  April  2013  that  was
           submitted  to  the  R  in  evidence  with  the  30  April   2013
           application states that 'for all intentions and purposes  a  set
           of accounts have  been  prepared,  showing  net  taxable  income
           (After deducting all expenses) for the  period  ended  from  1st
           August 2012 to 31st March 2013 to be �14,543.' [sic].  That  set
           of accounts has not been produced in evidence and  there  is  no
           explanation  of  the  discrepancy  in  the  2013   self-employed
           earnings in the 1 July 2019 letter by the same accountant.

           34.4  Mr Hussain pointed out that the P60 and HMRC  records  for
           the tax year ending in April 2013 show a higher amount of  gross
           earnings than had been declared, of �24,641.36 for that  period,
           which in his submission would, when added to  the  self-employed
           earnings declared to the HMRC, provided  Appellant  1  with  the
           number of points required to warrant a grant of leave to  remain
           under the relevant category within the Immigration Rules in  any
           event.  However, Appellant 1 says in his witness statement  that
           he 'relied' on the �22,695.14 earnings shown  by  his  payslips,
           which if true means that he would have overestimated the  amount
           he needed in self-employed earnings  to  obtain  the  number  of
           points he required for a grant of leave, which provides a motive
           for dishonest inflation of the  self-employed  earnings  in  the
           declaration to the Respondent.

           35.   I place significant  positive  weight  in  favour  of  the
           Respondent's allegations on my consideration that the  two  sets
           of discrepancies share the characteristic that the self-employed
           earnings declared to the Respondent by Appellant 1  were  higher
           than the self-employed earnings he declared to HMRC.

           36.   I place significant  positive  weight  in  favour  of  the
           Respondent's  allegations   on   my   consideration   that   the
           discrepancies also share the characteristic that  the  Appellant
           would, if his statement  that  he  relied  on  his  payslips  in
           relation to the 2013 declaration to the Respondent is true, have
           thought that self-employed earnings of the amounts that  he  has
           declared to the HMRC would not have been  sufficient  to  obtain
           the number of points he required for  a  grant  of  leave,  when
           added to the employed  earnings  he  had,  or  thought  he  had,
           received for the relevant period.

           37.   I also place  some,  albeit  little,  positive  weight  in
           favour  of  the  Respondent's  allegations  on   the   confusing
           explanation given by Appellant 1 as to  why  he  had  needed  to
           correct or resubmit tax returns in the  questionnaire  completed
           by him on 28 March 2017.  Appellant 1 stated  in  oral  evidence
           that the explanation he had given in the  questionnaire  related
           to  an  occasion  in  June  2012  when  he  was  stopped  by  an
           Immigration Officer on return from a trip overseas, which he had
           either been told or had assumed was related to his amendment  of
           the 2011 tax declaration.   However,  the  written  question  is
           perfectly clear, and his  explanation  makes  no  sense  and  is
           inconsistent  with  the  explanations  given  in   his   witness
           statement, the 1 July 2019 letter by the accountant, and in oral
           evidence.

           38.   Mr Hussain asserted that the Respondent was required as  a
           matter of procedural fairness to interview  Appellant  1  having
           formed the suspicion of dishonesty relating  to  HMRC  data.   I
           disagree:

           38.1  Firstly, the policy document states on its  face  that  it
           applies to all migrants whose most recent grant of LTR was  Tier
           1 (General), which was not so in Appellant 1's case.   Moreover,
           and in any event, the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Balajigari  v  The
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA  Civ  673
           (16 April 2019) opined as follows:

                 '56.  We do not consider that an interview is necessary  in
                 all cases.  The Secretary  of  State's  own  rules  give  a
                 discretion on him to hold such an interview.  However,  the
                 duty to act fairly does not,  in  our  view,  require  that
                 discretion  to  be  exercised  in  all  cases.   A  written
                 procedure may well suffice in most cases.

           38.2  Secondly, that Court also explained, at [105], that  where
           the Respondent has alleged dishonesty,  the  obligation  to  act
           with procedural fairness will be satisfied by the opportunity to
           adduce evidence in rebuttal in an appeal to this Tribunal.

           39.   Considering all of the evidence in the round,  I  conclude
           that the Respondent has discharged its burden  of  showing  that
           Appellant 1 dishonestly inflated his self-employed  earnings  in
           his 2011 and 2013 applications to the Respondent,  in  order  to
           achieve the number of points required  to  warrant  a  grant  of
           leave  to  remain  under  the  relevant  category   within   the
           Immigration Rules.

           40.   The Respondent's position is that Appellant 1's dishonesty
           in relation to his declarations  of  earnings  is  an  issue  of
           character and conduct of a level of seriousness that would  make
           it undesirable for him to be granted  leave  to  remain  in  the
           United Kingdom.  That  is  not  an  irrational  position  in  my
           assessment; the Court of Appeal in Balajigari at  [37]  accepted
           that, although as a matter of principle dishonest  conduct  will
           not always and  in  every  case  reach  a  sufficient  level  of
           seriousness to justify refusal on the  applicable  discretionary
           grounds within the Immigration  Rules,  in  the  context  of  an
           earnings discrepancy case  it  is  very  hard  to  see  how  the
           deliberate and dishonest submission of false  earnings  figures,
           whether to HMRC or to the Home Office, would not do so.

           41.    I  cannot  therefore  find  that  Appellant  1  met   the
           requirements to be granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom
           under the Immigration Rules on the ground of long residence,  or
           private life.   The question of whether Appellant 1's dishonesty
           reaches a sufficient level of seriousness such that it is in the
           public interest that  he  should  be  removed  from  the  United
           Kingdom is one that requires a balancing  exercise  informed  by
           weighing all relevant  factors,  which  the  Tribunal's  present
           jurisdiction  permits  me  to  perform  only  outside   of   the
           Immigration Rules."

   19. As there appears, none of the Judge's findings are  premised  on  the
       lack of evidence from the accountant per se.  The discrepancy in  the
       2011 return was, as I have already observed, due to an amendment made
       by the First Appellant himself and the Judge considered the  evidence
       in  that  context.   The  2013  return  was  not  mentioned  in   the
       accountant's letter at all and therefore the Judge did not  refer  to
       evidence from that source.  His findings are based on the explanation
       given by the First Appellant since that was the only evidence  before
       the Judge relating to that particular discrepancy.

   20. The inability of the Second Appellant and  accountant  to  attend  to
       give evidence did not for those reasons deprive the Appellants  of  a
       fair hearing.  The evidence central to both the discrepancies  relied
       on by the Respondent and the Article 8 claim was that  of  the  First
       Appellant.  He was able to attend and give evidence.  The Judge heard
       and considered that evidence and there has therefore be no impact  on
       the procedural fairness of the hearing.

   21. Turning then to ground two, the Appellants' grounds  challenging  the
       Judge's findings appear at [14] to [24] of the pleading.  In essence,
       those  paragraphs  insist  that  the  First  Appellant's  explanation
       "should have been accepted", that adverse inferences should not  have
       been drawn based on lack of evidence, that the Judge's  approach  was
       "harsh, and that the explanation given was  "an  acceptable  innocent
       explanation".  Those assertions do not reveal any error of law by the
       Judge.  They are simply a disagreement with the Judge's findings.

   22. I readily accept that this is a slightly unusual Tier 1 case in that,
       at least as regards the 2011 figures, the discrepancy arises not from
       the original  tax  return  which  was  later  amended  but  from  the
       amendment itself.  Nor, uncommonly in such cases, is reliance  placed
       on an error by an accountant (save perhaps by inference in failing to
       claim appropriate deductible business expenses).  However, the  Judge
       recognised that the 2011 discrepancy was  not  one  relating  to  the
       turnover of the self-employed  business  but  there  noted  that  the
       effect  was  to  reduce  the  First  Appellant's  tax  liability   in
       comparison with that which would flow from the earnings  as  declared
       to the Respondent (see [33.3] in particular).

   23. Further, and in any event, the Judge was also being asked to consider
       the discrepancy in the  2013  figures.   The  Judge  considered  that
       aspect at [34] and provided reasons why the explanation given did not
       satisfy him.

   24. The Judge adopted  the  correct  approach  in  his  analysis  of  the
       evidence and burdens of proof in the passage which I cite above.   No
       error of law is disclosed by ground two.

   25. Although paragraphs [25] and [26] of the pleaded ground relate to the
       Article 8 determination, they do so only in relation to  the  Judge's
       refusal to adjourn with which I have already dealt.  In fact, it  may
       well be this part of the pleading  which  caused  Judge  Blundell  to
       grant permission as it relates to the Second Appellant being deprived
       of the opportunity to present her case.  I have  already  dealt  with
       that aspect under ground one and explained why that ground  does  not
       demonstrate any error of law in the Decision.

  CONCLUSION

   26. For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the Appellants' grounds do
       not demonstrate any error of law in the Decision.  I therefore uphold
       the Decision with the consequence that the Appellants' appeals remain
       dismissed.



DECISION

I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal Decision  of  Judge  T  Lawrence
promulgated on 24 July 2019 does not contain a  material  error  of  law.  I
therefore uphold the decision with  the  consequence  that  the  Appellants'
appeals remain dismissed.
