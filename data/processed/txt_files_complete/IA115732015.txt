                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No Representative


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and to avoid confusion I shall refer to her  as  being  "the
    claimant".

2.   The respondent is a citizen of the Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  who
    was born on 16th March, 1975 and who arrived in the United  Kingdom  on
    12th November, 1996 and claimed asylum.

3.   The respondent has a lengthy immigration history.  He  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom on 12th November, 1996 and claimed asylum.  He then left
    the country on an unknown date but returned to the  United  Kingdom  on
    15th September, 1999 using a false French ID card and a different name.
     He claimed asylum the following day using his real name but  this  was
    refused on 6th December, 2000.  He lodged an appeal against refusal.

4.   In the meanwhile, on 11th April, 2001 he was sentenced to  four  years'
    imprisonment for causing death by  careless  or  inconsiderate  driving
    while unfit through drink and using a motor vehicle  whilst  uninsured.
    He was served with a notice of intention of a deportation order.

5    In a determination promulgated on 11th November, 2003 the  respondent's
    appeals against both decisions were dismissed by an  Adjudicator.   The
    claimant made a deportation order but not until 21st January, 2014.

6.   On 4th July, 2006 the respondent  made  an  application  for  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as the partner of a British citizen.

7.   Removal directions were set and on 26th January,  2010  the  respondent
    applied to revoke the deportation order.  He made  a  fresh  claim  for
    asylum on 28th April, 2010 and a further application for asylum on  3rd
    September, 2010.  On 28th September, 2010 the  respondent's  solicitors
    wrote to the Secretary of State asking her to grant leave  outside  the
    Rules.  She treated the various  submissions  and  applications  as  an
    application to revoke the deportation  order  and  refused  it  on  4th
    February, 2011.

8.   The respondent's appeal was heard on 20th May, 2011 by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, who found  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect  the
    respondent's partner, [CE], a British citizen, to relocate to  the  DRC
    and thought it unreasonable to expect the  couple's  children,  Shelton
    and Jamierolls to relocate to the DRC.  A determination of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal promulgated on 27th May, 2011  allowed  the  respondents'
    appeal under Article 8.  On  1st  November,  2011  the  respondent  was
    granted discretionary leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  until
    August, 2012 and a subsequent period of discretionary leave  to  remain
    until 31st October, 2014.

9.   The respondent separated from [CE] in July,  2013.   On  23rd  October,
    2014 he submitted a claim for further leave to remain under  Article  8
    on the basis of his relationship with his new partner, [CK], a  British
    citizen and their children, [C] and [B].  The application  was  refused
    in a Notice of Refusal to vary leave to enter or remain and a  decision
    to remove was dated 18th May, 2015.  A decision was made to remove  the
    respondent by way of directions under Section 47 of the Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2006.  Notice of Appeal was lodged on 26th March, 2015.

10.  In a letter dated 19th March,  2015  the  respondent's  representatives
    gave notice that they would be seeking permission to amend the  grounds
    of appeal to include asylum grounds.  At the hearing before the  First-
    tier Tribunal  Judge  the  claimant  refused  to  grant  permission  to
    consider a new matter which had not previously been considered by  her.
    Permission of course was required by virtue of  Section  85(5)  of  the
    Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  as  amended  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014.

11.  The refusal by the claimant of the respondent's application  was  under
    paragraphs 322(1), 322(1A) and 322(5A)(b) of Statement  of  Changes  in
    Immigration Rules HC 395.

12.  In a determination promulgated on  16th  December,  2015,  following  a
    hearing on 23rd November,  2015,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Courtney
    found that the respondent  could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  but  having  considered  the  matter  outside   the
    Immigration  Rules  concluded  that  the  respondent's  removal   would
    interfere with the respondent's family  life  and  that  of  his  minor
    children.  The  judge  did  not  believe  that  such  interference  was
    justified and concluded that there were compelling circumstances  which
    supported a claim for the grant of leave to remain outside the Rules.

13.   The  claimant  challenged  the  determination  and  the  first   three
    paragraphs of the application are as follows:-

         "1.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge has dismissed the  appeal  under
             the Immigration Rules  (paragraph  322(5A)(b)  on  suitability
             grounds adopting the reasoning as argued in the  Secretary  of
             State for the Home Department's decision.  However, the First-
             tier Tribunal Judge has gone on to allow the appeal on Article
             8 grounds outside the Rules.   It  is  respectfully  submitted
             that in the light of the [respondent's] failure  to  meet  the
             suitability requirements due to repeat  offending  the  First-
             tier Tribunal Judge has failed to provide adequate reasons for
             the finding that there is a  reasonably  arguable  case  under
             ECHR which has not already been sufficiently dealt with by the
             Rules.


         2.    Furthermore,  the  line  of  authorities  established  by  MF
             (Nigeria),  Gulshan  and  Nagre  make  it   clear   that   the
             circumstances of the  majority  of  applicants  for  leave  to
             remain will fall within the provisions of the complete code as
             regards Article 8 ECHR now provided  for  in  the  Immigration
             Rules.  Only in those cases in  which  the  circumstances  are
             particularly  compelling  and   crucial,   'not   sufficiently
             recognised by the Rules' (in the sense that the  circumstances
             are so unusual as not to have been anticipated by the  Rules),
             should it lead to a consideration of  Article  8  outside  the
             Rules.


         3.   It is submitted that when considered alongside the evidence at
             [32] that there was no evidence of the children's  ill-health,
             special educational needs  or  welfare  issues  there  was  an
             absence of particularly compelling  circumstances  to  justify
             the First-tier Tribunal looking at Article 8  outside  of  the
             Rules and to do so was an misdirection of law [sic]."

14.  The remaining paragraphs merely seek permission  and  request  an  oral
    hearing.

15.  At the hearing before me the  respondent  appeared  unrepresented.   He
    told me that he had not been able  to  secure  the  attendance  of  his
    representative despite having reached some form of agreement  with  his
    representative, but his representative would accept payment for fees by
    way of instalments.  I told the respondent that I had already  received
    a letter from his representative, who made it clear  that  he  was  not
    going to be attending the hearing and had no instructions.

16.  The respondent told me that if I were to grant an adjournment  then  he
    would  make  sure  that  on  the  next  occasion  he   would   have   a
    representative.  He told me  that  he  received  �140  every  fortnight
    social security and  is  not  working.   The  �140  he  receives  every
    fortnight is for himself, his partner and his two children.   He  tells
    me that he pays his partner �50 and  that  he  also  gives  his  former
    partner �50 every fortnight for their children's maintenance.   In  the
    circumstances I refused the adjournment because  I  was  not  satisfied
    that were I to adjourn the  hearing,  the  respondent  would  be  in  a
    position to be represented on the next occasion.

17.  Mr Duffy then addressed me on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State.   He
    told me that he was embarrassed and would not be seeking to rely on the
    grounds.  He suggested that if the grounds were correct, then it  would
    be impossible ever in a case where  an  appellant  fails  to  meet  the
    suitability grounds for Section 55 to be considered and that  must,  he
    suggested, be wrong.  I believe  that  in  the  circumstances  of  this
    appeal Mr Duffy was entirely correct not to rely on the grounds.

18.   In  the  circumstances  I  find  that  the  claimant  has  failed   to
    demonstrate that the First-tier Tribunal Judge has made  any  error  of
    law in his determination.  I uphold the decision of First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Courtney.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
