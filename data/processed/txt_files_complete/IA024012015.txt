      Mr T Wilding (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer) (May 2016)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of GK, a citizen of India born [ ]  1941,  against
       the refusal of leave to remain and consequent removal directions made
       under section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act  2006.
       Her appeal having been dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal, she  now
       appeals to the Upper Tribunal with permission.


    2. The immigration history supplied by the Respondent records  that  she
       entered the United Kingdom as a visitor from 25 July  2011  until  19
       January 2012, from 29 March 2013 until 14 September 2013, and on  the
       occasion leading to this application, on 3 June 2014  with  leave  to
       enter granted until 25 October 2014.


    3. Her application was to remain as the dependent relative  of  her  son
       MJ. The representations and  materials  supporting  that  application
       show that following her arrival MJ noticed a marked deterioration  in
       her health since he had last seen her,  and  realised  that  she  was
       increasingly unable to carry out  everyday  tasks  such  as  washing,
       dressing and cooking, her mobility  being  severely  restricted.  The
       family believed she would no longer be able to return to live  safely
       in India. MJ earned over ï¿½23,000 annually in his permanent post as  a
       security officer, and he and his wife  were  only  three  years  from
       paying off their mortgage. Supporting  documents  included  a  letter
       from Dr Nanra of New Delhi of September 2014  stating  that  she  had
       suffered from Type 2 diabetes mellitus,  hypertension  and,  for  the
       last few months, additionally from Parkinson's disease. Dr Kumar of a
       medical centre in Slough wrote stating that  she  was  on  medication
       from India which she took regularly; recent blood  tests  showed  she
       was  suffering  from  anaemia  and  that  her  diabetes  was   poorly
       controlled. She needed help throughout the day with various tasks; he
       understood that in India she had only one son to look after  her.  He
       would  appreciate  it  if  her  further  stay  could  be   considered
       favourably.


    4. The application was refused because she had not been established that
       she was unable to integrate back in India and thus could not  satisfy
       Rule 276ADE(vi), the only private life route potentially open to  her
       given her limited period of residence in the United Kingdom.  It  was
       not accepted that there were exceptional circumstances present in her
       case given that her own medical evidence indicated that treatment for
       Type 2  Diabetes,  Hypertension  and  Parkinson's  Disease  were  all
       available  in  India:  any  differential  in  treatment  between  the
       countries did not justify her remaining here.


    5. In his witness statement for the appeal MJ set out  that  his  father
       had died some twenty years ago since when his mother had lived alone.
       His elder sister had lived near her and helped her to cope until  her
       death in 2010. His other two sisters were married, lived  with  their
       husbands and were already responsible for  looking  after  their  own
       children and in-laws. His sister R had recently joined her husband in
       the USA. Although he had previously been aware  his  mother's  health
       was deteriorating, it was only after her  arrival  on  this  occasion
       that he appreciated that  she  was  no  longer  able  to  look  after
       herself. She found it difficult to do  the  simplest  of  tasks,  and
       could not remember whether she had taken her medication.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal recorded  that  it  could  make  no  findings
       regarding the Appellant's financial circumstances as no evidence  had
       been put forward as to her ownership of capital assets.  It  accepted
       that she suffered from the stated medical conditions but noted  there
       was no evidence as to the rate of progression  of  her  illness.  The
       affidavits  from  the  daughters  in  India  were   afforded   "scant
       evidential weight" as they were  considered  self-serving,  aimed  as
       they were at  presenting  a  case  that  she  lack  care  abroad.  No
       financial details had been put forwards from family  members  besides
       MJ as to their ability to fund any required support.


    7. The Tribunal did not accept that the Appellant  would  be  unable  to
       integrate in India, where she had lived for most of  her  life.  Rule
       276ADE(vi) was not a paragraph relating to hardship: it  looked  only
       to the existence of barriers to integration. The submission  made  on
       her behalf that the appeal could succeed outside the  Rules,  without
       having to return abroad to make an entry  clearance  as  a  dependent
       relative, failed absent clear evidence that she  was  dependent  upon
       her son. There was no evidence as to her residential circumstances in
       India in terms of the help available to her  at  home.  It  would  be
       wrong to allow an appeal based on  dependency  considerations  within
       the rubric of an appeal based upon Rule 276ADE.


    8. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier Tribunal had been  wrong
       to state that the case had not been pressed both inside  and  outside
       the Rules, and that the judge was wrong to conclude  that  there  was
       "quite literally, no evidence upon which I  could  properly  conclude
       that the Appellant is dependent on her son."


    9. Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  14
       December 2015 on the basis that the  judge  may  have  erred  in  his
       assessment of there being no evidence relevant to  dependency  before
       him, and additionally because it was arguably erroneous to consider a
       Rule 276ADE appeal as hopeless by reference  to  whether  an  out-of-
       country application as a dependent relative might have succeeded.


Findings and reasons - Error of law hearing

   10. Having heard submission ably made  by  both  representatives  at  the
       original hearing, I found that the First-tier Tribunal was  wrong  to
       state that there was no evidence that could  demonstrate  dependency.
       To the contrary, there was witness statement and oral  evidence  from
       the Sponsor and other family members, as  well  as  material  from  a
       General Practitioner, which was patently relevant to the  issue.  The
       failure to identify relevant evidence supporting the primary issue on
       the appeal was patently capable of amounting  to  a  material  error,
       given that the appeal was  not  one  doomed  to  fail  taken  at  its
       highest.


   11. The First-tier Tribunal was invited to determine this appeal  outside
       the Rules, and its statement at  the  end  of  the  decision  to  the
       contrary was clearly misguided. It became rather confused as  to  its
       task, and failed to posit the critical question as to  whether  there
       was a compelling case to justify such departure, to which  its  error
       as  to  the  available  evidence   regarding   dependency   doubtless
       contributed; and it additionally  failed  to  adequately  assess  the
       relevance of considerations arising under the Adult Dependent  Route,
       which cannot be said to be irrelevant merely because  an  application
       cannot be made under it  from  within  the  United  Kingdom,  for  it
       carefully  expresses  the  imperatives  of  public   policy   towards
       applications of this nature as endorsed by Parliament. That  too  was
       an error of law.


   12. Given the failure to take account of these  considerations,  I  found
       that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was flawed  by  material
       errors of law. As there was no need for wholesale redetermination  of
       the appeal, I adjourned the appeal for substantive re-hearing in  the
       Upper Tribunal.


Continuation Hearing


   13. At the continuation hearing, I admitted further evidence by way of  a
       GP's report of 3 May 2016 which set out that the Appellant  continued
       to suffer from hypertension  and  diabetes  for  which  she  received
       prescription medicine from India. It made no mention  of  Parkinson's
       disease. Her diabetic control was described as average.


   14. The Sponsor gave evidence, saying that of the two daughters  resident
       in India, one had now moved to America. The other  looked  after  her
       husband's family. They had sought further evidence from the doctor in
       India who had been treating her, but he had simply  stated  that  she
       needed ongoing care. Cross examined, he said that his mother had been
       diagnosed with hypertension recently though  corrected  himself  when
       reminded that it was said that she had received  both  her  diagnoses
       around 12 years ago according to Dr Nanra. His sister in America  had
       passed away five years ago. His mother had been  living  alone  since
       then in India caring for herself. Although the family had been  aware
       of all these ailments before she last  entered  the  United  Kingdom,
       they had not applied for entry  clearance  for  her  as  a  dependent
       relative because it  was  only  after  she  arrived  here  that  they
       realised how needy she was, a which point they decided  to  make  the
       application giving rise to this appeal. If she  went  back  to  India
       they would try to financially support her but did not feel that  they
       would be able to afford to do so as she would face medical charges as
       well as accommodation costs of around ï¿½700 a month. They received her
       medicine from India, usually by post, although on a past  trip  there
       he had picked up a few months' supply. As  to  relatives  beyond  his
       siblings, the younger family members were not close to her. There was
       no re-examination.


   15. For the Respondent Mr Wilding submitted  that  there  was  no  cogent
       evidence that established a high  level  of  dependency  between  the
       Appellant and her family here. This was not a case  where  there  had
       been a sudden deterioration of an applicant's health post-arrival: it
       was not shown that there would even be a need for a  care  home.  For
       the Appellant Mr Cutting argued that the family were best  placed  to
       make the assessment in question and this was a credible scenario: the
       gaps in the evidence were to be regretted but  the  family  had  done
       their best, notwithstanding the failure of the doctor  in  India  who
       had formerly been treating her to detail the care package. The family
       here were able to look after her and genuinely feared that she  would
       die alone if she returned abroad.


Findings and reasons - Continuation hearing

   16. I do not consider that the claim has any prospect  of  success  under
       the Rules, the only relevant route being the private life  one  under
       Rule 276ADE. The Appellant was plainly integrated in India, a country
       where she had lived for most of her  life  before  she  came  to  the
       United Kingdom, where she was receiving  medical  treatment  for  her
       health problems, and where she must be presumed to  have  connections
       by way of extended family and friends  absent  any  evidence  to  the
       contrary: and so I do not accept  that  she  would  face  significant
       obstacles to her integration on a return there.


   17. The requirements of the Immigration Rules irrelevant  to  the  lawful
       determination of the appeal. As it was put in SS (Congo) & Ors [2015]
       EWCA Civ 387, "it is accurate to say that the general position ... is
       that compelling circumstances would need to be identified to  support
       a claim for grant of LTR outside the new Rules". At  [48]  the  Court
       goes on:


           "What does matter, however -  whether  one  is  dealing  with  a
           section of the Rules which constitutes a "complete code" (as  in
           MF (Nigeria)) or with a section of the  Rules  which  is  not  a
           "complete code" (as in Nagre and the present appeals)  -  is  to
           identify, for the purposes of  application  of  Article  8,  the
           degree of weight to be attached  to  the  expression  of  public
           policy in the substantive part of the Rules  in  the  particular
           context in question (which will not always be  the  same:  hence
           the guidance we seek to give in this judgment), as well  as  the
           other factors relevant to the Article 8  balancing  exercise  in
           the particular case (which, again, may well vary from context to
           context and from case to case)."


   18.  Whilst  I  do  not  consider  that  this  is  an  especially  strong
       application for justifying a departure from the Rules for  compelling
       reasons, I cannot rule out the possibility that it might succeed,  or
       to put it another way, there is  sufficient  here  to  amount  to  an
       arguable case to justify a second  stage  consideration  outside  the
       Rules.


   19. There are two Rules which potentially bear on  applications  of  this
       nature: Rule 276ADE which, for an adult over the age of  25  who  has
       not lived in this country for more than 20 years, focusses  upon  the
       prospect of integration abroad,  and  the  dependent  relative  Rules
       under  Appendix  FM.  I  have  already  addressed  the  former,   and
       accordingly take account of the fact that the Appellant would be able
       to integrate on a return to India in assessing the proportionality of
       the interference with her Article 8 rights.


   20. The other Rule relevant by analogy is that under the Adult  Dependant
       Relative route under Appendix FM which only permits  applications  to
       be made via the entry clearance route. Its other salient features are
       that:


      a) the individual must as a  result  of  age,  illness  or  disability
         require long-term personal  care  to  perform  everyday  tasks  (E-
         ECDR.2.4);


      b) they must be unable, even with the practical and financial help  of
         the sponsor, to obtain the required level of care  in  the  country
         where they are living, because it is not available and there is  no
         person in that country who can reasonably provide it or it  is  not
         affordable (E-ECDR.2.5);


      c) they can be adequately maintained, accommodated and  cared  for  in
         the UK  by  the  sponsor  without  recourse  to  public  funds  (E-
         ECDR.3.1); the sponsor must undertake to be responsible  for  their
         maintenance, accommodation and care, for a period of 5 years from a
         grant of indefinite leave (E-ECDR.3.2);


      d) the supporting evidence demonstrating those criteria are met should
         take  the  form  of  evidence  from  a  doctor  or   other   health
         professional, or where relevant from  a  central  or  local  health
         authority (Appendix FM-SE).


   21. The first imperative is the general absolute  bar  to  an  in-country
       application by an adult parent.  A  credible  reason  for  making  an
       application whilst a visitor might present a  compelling  reason  for
       departing from this requirement: as shown by Chen (IJR)  [2015]  UKUT
       189 (IAC), a strong evidence-backed case may demonstrate good  reason
       for departing for the general requirement of prior  entry  clearance,
       having regard to the principle identified in  Chikwamba  [2008]  UKHL
       40. Secondly there is a very high substantive  threshold  set,  which
       requires that no care be available, even with practical and financial
       help from the family here.  Thirdly  there  are  specific  evidential
       requirements including the  opinion  of  a  doctor  or  other  health
       professional as to their  ability  to  perform  everyday  tasks,  and
       additionally an indication of the needs in the country of origin.


   22. I have already explained the relevance of  the  Rules  governing  the
       admission of  adult  dependent  relatives.  They  pose  a  series  of
       difficulties for the Appellant, in so far as they indicate the public
       policy position in cases of adult dependency which is relevant to the
       government's side of the balance when Article 8(2)  of  the  ECHR  is
       assessed, in particular that:


      a) Unfortunately, notwithstanding the encouragement I gave at the
         first hearing before the Upper Tribunal for further evidence to be
         provided, that opportunity has not been taken up, beyond the
         provision of a very brief updating report, so there is very
         limited evidence from medical practitioners as to her actual care
         needs, making it uncertain as to whether she truly requires long-
         term personal care to perform everyday tasks; equally there is
         very limited evidence of her care regime in India, and one cannot
         overlook the fact that it is from that country from where her
         medicine is in fact obtained;


      b) The most recent medical evidence from her own doctor in this
         country does not suggest that she suffers from any symptoms or
         disadvantages caused by Parkinson's Disease;


      c) No evidence has been put before me to establish that there are
         friends and relatives who might be able to care for her abroad, or
         whether she has sufficient capital assets (a matter which
         concerned the First-tier Tribunal) to fund care arrangements for
         herself;


      d) There is no schedule of predicted earnings and expenses over the
         next few years (five years post-settlement being the proscribed
         period in the Rules) capable of providing an assurance that she
         would not be a burden on public funds.


   23. Nevertheless I recognise that  the  Rules  of  course  represent  the
       starting point of departure for an assessment  necessarily  conducted
       outside them, and cannot be treated  as  a  complete  answer  to  the
       Appellant's case. In the wider context of the Human Rights Convention
       and Article 8 ECHR, bearing in mind the  well-established  principles
       in Razgar (2004) UKHL 27, it cannot seriously be  disputed  that  the
       Appellant has established private and family life  here,  based  upon
       her length of residence in a family  unit,  spending  time  with  her
       children and grandchildren. I accept that she is partially  dependent
       on the Sponsor and his family: that is only to be expected given  her
       age. Plainly her departure as a consequence of the decision to refuse
       her application would interfere with that life. Article 8 is engaged.




   24. The Respondent's decision is in accordance with the law and pursues a
       legitimate aim, i.e. the economic well-being of the country in  terms
       of immigration control, and so the relevant issue in  the  appeal  is
       thus proportionality: in a case of this nature,  I  must  essentially
       ask whether the Respondent's decision strikes a fair balance  between
       private right and public interest.


   25. I accept that the family did not  intend  to  circumvent  immigration
       control by making the application leading to this appeal,  given  the
       credible evidence that her health was in their view worse  than  they
       had believed it to be before she travelled  here:  she  has  complied
       with immigration control on previous visits.  So that public interest
       factor does not count against her.


   26. At this  point,  however,  I  fear  that  the  disadvantages  already
       identified in my assessment of the case by reference to the available
       evidence as to her care needs and potential alternative  arrangements
       in India outweigh the family life that she has established here. That
       family life has of course developed in the  light  of  the  knowledge
       that her residence here is temporary and to that  extent  precarious,
       which is of course a relevant factor: I appreciate  that  her  family
       are  not  qualifying  partners  as  defined  by  section  117B,   but
       nevertheless the position struck by the Strasbourg Court is  that  in
       general non-settled residence (and certainly residence for  a  period
       as temporary as that found here) is considered  precarious,  see  for
       example Sales LJ in Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440 at [28]:  "since  her
       family life was established with knowledge that she had no  right  to
       be in the United Kingdom and was therefore precarious in the relevant
       sense, it is only if her case is exceptional for some reason that she
       will be able to establish a violation of Article 8: see Nagre, paras.
       [39]-[41]; SS (Congo), para. [29]; and Jeunesse v Netherlands, paras.
       [108], [114] and [122]."  Whilst  significant  dependency  on  family
       members must be capable of tipping  the  balance  in  favour  of  the
       individual, in this case it is uncertain, for  example,  whether  the
       difficulties with her health regime noted following her arrival  were
       due to a temporary malady: it would appear, from the medical  reports
       generally, that she recovered speedily, given the absence of  similar
       reports more recently. The Appellant's son has  chosen  to  make  his
       life in the United Kingdom and that  inevitably  entailed  separation
       from his mother given the absence of any route under the  Immigration
       Rules that would secure her extended entry and residence here.


   27. Applying the  other  factors  in  section  117B  of  the  Nationality
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, it is difficult to hold any lack  of
       English language proficiency against her given she  would  be  living
       within the family unit and would not be entering the  labour  market.
       Whether she would be financially independent is unclear in the longer
       term given the family's limited means.


   28. Overall I find that the interference with the  Article  8  rights  of
       Appellant and the Sponsor and his family is not  disproportionate  to
       the need to maintain immigration control.

          Decision:

The appeal is dismissed.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Symes
