Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh born on 30 June 1972.

 2. He was granted leave to enter the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student from
    6 April 2010 until 30 November 2011. Thereafter his leave was extended.
    On 14 August 2012 he was granted  further  leave  to  remain  until  14
    August 2014. On 13 August he applied for further  leave  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student. On 16 October 2014 his application  was  refused  by
    the respondent on the basis that he had failed to show, as required  by
    Paragraph 1A of Appendix C of the Immigration Rules,  that  he  was  in
    possession of ï¿½8,080 for a consecutive 28 day period.

 3. The appellant appealed and his appeal was heard by First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT") Judge O'Hagan.

 4.  The  issue  before  the  FtT  was  whether  appellant  satisfied   the
    requirements of paragraphs 1A and 1B of Appendix C.  These include  the
    following:
       . 1A(a) The applicant must have the funds specified in  the  relevant
         part of Appendix C at the date of the application.
       . IA(c) If the applicant  is  applying  as  a  Tier  4  Migrant,  the
         applicant must have had the funds referred to in (a)  above  for  a
         consecutive 28-day period of time.
       . IA(ca) If the applicant is applying for entry clearance or leave to
         remain as a Tier 4 Migrant, he must confirm that the funds referred
         to in (a) above are  (i)  available  in  the  manner  specified  in
         paragraph 13 below for his use in studying and living  in  the  UK;
         and (ii) that  the  funds  will  remain  available  in  the  manner
         specified in paragraph 13 below unless used to pay course fees  and
         living costs
       . 1B(a)(i)(3) In all cases where Appendix C or Appendix E states that
         an applicant  is  required  to  provide  specified  documents,  the
         specified  documents  are  personal  bank   or   building   society
         statements which ... must cover ... a consecutive 28 day period  of
         time if the applicant is applying as a Tier 4 Migrant ..."

 5. The FtT found that the appellant satisfied all of the  requirements  of
    paragraph 1A. With respect to subparagraph 1A(c), the  FtT  stated,  at
    paragraph [10] of the decision, that it
         "... accepted that the appellant had the funds specified as at  the
         date of his application and that he had done so for [a] consecutive
         28 day period of time."

 6. The FtT did not accept, however, that that the appellant satisfied  the
    requirements of paragraph 1B. There  are  four  alternative  routes  by
    which 1B can be satisfied and the FtT reached the view that  none  were
    satisfied by the appellant and accordingly dismissed the  appeal.  With
    respect to 1B(a) the FtT stated at paragraph [12]
         "... this route was clearly inapplicable in this case  because  the
         evidence supplied by the appellant plainly falls outside  of  [its]
         ambit".

 7. The grounds of appeal submit that the FtT materially erred  by  failing
    to recognise that the  appellant  met  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    1(B)(a). The basis of this argument is that the FtT had before it,  but
    failed to rely on, a letter dated 7 August 2014 from Pubali  Bank.  The
    contention  made  in  the  grounds,  and  reiterated  by  Mr  Khan   in
    submissions before me, is that this bank statement plainly fell  within
    the ambit of paragraph 1B(a).

 8. I agree with Mr Khan that this statement was before the FtT and  was  a
    matter it was required to consider in addressing the issue  of  whether
    the appellant satisfied paragraph 1B(a).

 9. Careful review of this statement shows the following:
       . It was printed on 7 August 2014
       . The period covered by the statement is 7 August 2014 until 7 August
         2014
       . The statement shows that on 7 August 2014 the sum  of  13,50,000.00
         Bangladeshi currency was credited to the account
       . The statement shows the appellant's name, the  account  number  and
         the stamp of the financial institution.

10.  It is readily apparent that this statement does not show funds in  the
    account for a  consecutive  period  of  28  days  as  required  by  sub
    paragraph 1B(a). Rather, it shows funds in  the  account  for  one  day
    only.

11. When this was put to Mr Khan at the error of law  hearing  he  did  not
    question the above described interpretation of the statement, or  argue
    that there was another statement or  statements  before  the  FtT  that
    should have been relied on. Instead, his argument was that the FtT  had
    accepted that the appellant had the required funds for a consecutive 28
    day period and this finding of fact should not be disturbed.

12. It is unclear why  the  FtT,  at  paragraph  [10],  accepted  that  the
    appellant had the requisite funds for the required period. No reason or
    explanation is given. What is clear,  however,  is  that  the  FtT,  in
    making this finding, was doing so with respect to paragraph 1A.

13. The issue before me, and in respect of which permission to  appeal  was
    granted, is whether the appellant satisfied the requirements of 1.B(a).
    Paragraph 1.B(a) requires that where, as in this case, an applicant  is
    applying as a Tier 4 Migrant, bank statements must show  a  consecutive
    28 day period of time. The bank  statement  upon  which  the  appellant
    sought to rely does not cover a consecutive 28 day period and therefore
    the requirement under  paragraph  1.B(a)  is  not  satisfied.  The  FtT
    therefore did not err in law by finding that the evidence  supplied  by
    the appellant was not able to satisfy paragraph 1.B(a).

Decision
      a. The appeal is dismissed.
      b. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making
         of a material error of law and shall stand.
      c. No anonymity order is made.
