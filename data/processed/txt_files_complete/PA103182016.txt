                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Shiner sitting at Taylor House on 27 October
    2016) dismissing his appeal against the decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse to recognise him as refugee, or as otherwise  requiring
    international or human rights protection.  The First-tier Tribunal made
    an anonymity direction in favour of the appellant, and I consider  that
    it is appropriate that the appellant continues to enjoy  anonymity  for
    these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 11 May 2017 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Plimmer  granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal for the following reasons:

        Having accepted the evidence of the Country Expert on the  situation
        for Kurds in Iran post-SSH  and  HR  (illegal  exit:  failed  asylum
        seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 00308 (IAC), it  is  arguable  that  the
        First-tier  Tribunal  has  provided  inadequate  reasons   for   not
        departing from the Country Guidance [57 and 58].

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 3. Both parties were legally represented before Judge Shiner.   The  Judge
    received oral evidence from the appellant, and  he  took  into  account
    written submissions from Counsel for the appellant  which  he  received
    after the hearing.

 4. Counsel for the appellant, Mr  Lee,  submitted  that  there  were  four
    factors which suggested that the appellant would be at risk upon return
    to Iran.  They were:

      i) the authorities would have "an adverse inference"  in  him  as  the
         result of  his  support  for  PJAK  (a  party  of  free  youths  of
         Kurdistan);

     ii) he was an ethnic Kurd;

    iii) he exited Iran illegally; and

     iv) he would be returning to Iran as a failed asylum seeker.

 5.  In  his  subsequent  decision,  the  Judge  accepted  the  appellant's
    identity, nationality and ethnicity.  He found that the  appellant  had
    come to the UK from Iran, arriving in the UK on or about 27 March 2016.
     He also accepted that, before leaving Iran, the appellant had lived in
    the district of Gorasher.  At paragraphs [45]-[53] of his decision, the
    Judge gave his reasons for finding that neither the appellant  nor  his
    father had engaged in distributing leaflets on behalf of the  PJAK,  or
    that the appellant had otherwise manifested support for the PJAK.   The
    Judge also rejected the appellant's  account  of  having  come  to  the
    adverse attention of the Iranian authorities through either his or  his
    father's involvement with the PJAK.  Specifically, he  did  not  accept
    that the authorities had raided the family home and had beaten  up  him
    and his mother; or that, on a more recent occasion, the police had come
    to arrest him and his father, but that he had escaped and there was  an
    outstanding warrant for his arrest which had since  been  sent  to  the
    family home.

 6. At paragraph [54] onwards, the Judge turned to consider  the  issue  of
    risk on return in the light of the appellant being an ethnic Kurd,  who
    had exited Iran illegally, and who would be  returning  to  Iran  as  a
    failed asylum seeker.  He referred to SSH and HR  -v-  SSHD.   He  said
    that while he was not  duty  bound  to  follow  this  Country  Guidance
    authority, he had had regard to EM and Others (Returnees)  Zimbabwe  CG
    [2011] UKUT 98 (IAC) and to the 2014 Practice Direction on  the  status
    of a reported determination of the Tribunal bearing the  letters  "CG".
    The Guidance stated that the  determination  shall  be  treated  as  an
    authoritative finding on the country guidance issue identified  in  the
    determination, based upon  the  evidence  before  the  members  of  the
    Tribunal that determined the appeal.  Such a Country Guidance case  was
    authoritative in any subsequent appeal,  insofar  as  that  appeal  (a)
    related to the Country Guidance issue in  question;  and  (b)  depended
    upon the same or similar evidence.

 7. The Judge noted paragraph 12.4 of the  2014  Practise  Direction  which
    provides as follows:

        Because it is a principle that like cases should be treated in  like
        manner, any failure to follow a clear, apparently applicable Country
        Guidance case or to show why it  does  not  apply  to  the  case  in
        question, it is likely to be regarded as grounds  for  appeal  on  a
        point of law.

 8. In his written submissions, Mr Lee invited the Judge to depart from the
    conclusions of the Country Guidance case of SSH and HR in light of  the
    contents of a generic report entitled "Kurds in  Iran"  from  Professor
    Joff�  dated  26  August  2016  which  was  included  in  the  508-page
    appellant's bundle at section A, pages 8-17.

 9. The Judge discussed the thrust of Professor Joff�'s report in paragraph
    [57], and reached the following conclusions in paragraph [58]:

        I accept the expert's evidence as to the increased tensions and  the
        increased  effort  by  Kurdish  militants  and   the   consequential
        hardening of the authorities' approach.  However,  I  conclude  such
        change in circumstances insufficient to give rise to a finding, even
        to the lower standard, that the appellant would  be  at  risk  as  a
        returning failed asylum seeker.  I do  not  accept  that  this  will
        result in the appellant being at any elevated risk upon  return.   I
        do not accept that the appellant, just because  he  is  a  returning
        Iranian, including a returning Iranian who has sought asylum,  would
        be subject to any significantly greater risk upon return  either  at
        the airport  or  later.   I  conclude,  having  regard  to  all  the
        circumstances to which I have been referred, and  have  referred  to
        myself, that SSH and HR -v- SSHD is authoritative.

The Error of Law Challenge

10. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Judge  Chohan.   He  said
    that there was no substance in the grounds, as the Judge had considered
    all the relevant facts and evidence, and the findings he had made  were
    open to him.  The Judge had  duly  considered  the  expert  report  but
    concluded that it was insufficient to find the appellant  would  be  at
    risk upon return.  Those findings were open to the Judge.

11. In a renewed application for permission to the Upper Tribunal,  Mr  Lee
    accepted that the Judge's credibility findings  as  a  whole  were  not
    challenged.  The Judge's rejection of the appellant's  account  of  his
    activities in Iran, and the Judge's findings  on  that  aspect  of  the
    appellant's case, did not form part of the application  for  permission
    to appeal.  The issue was over the  risk  on  return.   The  Judge  had
    failed to engage with much of the argument put before him.  It was  not
    simply that there had been a change of circumstances since SSH  and  HR
    had been decided, but also the expert  evidence  vigorously  challenged
    the conclusions that the Tribunal had reached in SSH and  HR.   On  the
    basis of Professor Joff�'s expert evidence, the Judge was  entitled  to
    depart from the findings of the Upper Tribunal in SSH and  HR,  as  the
    Tribunal had  done  in  similar  cases.   The  report  was  significant
    evidence from  a  well-respected  and  knowledgeable  expert.   It  was
    incumbent upon the Judge to engage at the very least with the  evidence
    and argument that the Upper Tribunal's conclusions were not safe in the
    light of Professor Joff�'s evidence.   For  example,  the  expert  gave
    evidence as to why a laisser-passer could not be obtained without risk.
     The Tribunal's conclusions as to the ability of a returnee to obtain a
    laisser-passer were central to the Tribunal's finding  in  SSH  and  HR
    that there was no risk on return after illegal exit.

The Error of Law Hearing

12. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out,  Ms  Hulse  developed  the  arguments  advanced  in  the   renewed
    application for permission to appeal.  She  directed  my  attention  to
    various passages in the expert report and in the Country Guidance  case
    upon which she relied.  In reply,  Mr  Nash  adhered  to  the  Rule  24
    response settled by a colleague, opposing the appeal.

Discussion

Ground 1

13. The guidance given in SSH and HR in the headnote and at paragraph  [33]
    is as follows:

         (a) An Iranian male who it is sought to return to  Iran,  who  does
         not possess a passport, will be  returnable  on  a  laisser-passer,
         which he can obtain from the Iranian Embassy on proof  of  identity
         and nationality;

         (b) an Iranian male in respect of  whom  no  adverse  interest  has
         previously been manifested by the Iranian state, does  not  face  a
         real risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3 rights  on  return
         to Iran on account of having left Iran  illegally  and/or  being  a
         failed  asylum  seeker.   No  such  risk  exists  at  the  time  of
         questioning on return to Iran, nor after the facts (i.e. of illegal
         exit and being a failed asylum seeker) have been  established.   In
         particular, there is no a  real  risk  of  prosecution  leading  to
         imprisonment.

14. An issue which arose in the  course  of  oral  argument  before  me  is
    whether this Country Guidance applies to Iranian males who  are  ethnic
    Kurds.  Ms Hulse submits that Kurdish males fall outside the  scope  of
    the Country Guidance authority.

15. Her submission on this issue is arguably  supported  by  an  unreported
    decision of Upper Tribunal Judge John Freeman dated 21  September  2016
    which appears at the back of section D of the appellant's  bundle.   In
    PA/04135/2015, the First-tier Tribunal found in the  claimant's  favour
    that he faced a real risk on return as a failed Kurdish  asylum  seeker
    who exited illegally.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not apply  SSH
    and HR, as this case had not been decided, or at least  reported,  when
    she heard the appeal on 10 June 2016.  The Secretary of Stated appealed
    the decision on the sole ground that  the  Judge  had  not  taken  into
    account the "subsequent" decision of the Tribunal in SSH and HR.  Judge
    Freeman dismissed the appeal of the Secretary of State  on  the  ground
    that the country guidance in SSH and HR did not  include  any  explicit
    statement that, "someone who puts themselves forward merely as  a  Kurd
    who has left illegally, and will be returned as a failed asylum seeker,
    does not face a real risk  of  persecution  for  that  reason."   Judge
    Freeman continued:

         Whilst it would have been an extremely relevant decision if it  had
         been available by the time of the hearing in this case,  and  might
         well have changed the Judge's view of the situation, if it had been
         put before her, there is nothing to show that she made an error  of
         law by failing to take account of any express country  guidance  in
         existence (my emphasis) by the time she  wrote  and  sent  out  her
         decision.

16. I consider that the decision of Judge Freeman turns on  its  particular
    facts, as I have highlighted by  placing  the  crucial  part  of  Judge
    Freeman's reasoning in italics. At best it only provides  weak  support
    for the proposition that SSH and HR does not apply to  Kurdish  Iranian
    males as well as to Iranian males of other ethnicities.

17. The two claimants in the  Country  Guidance  case  were  Kurds.  As  is
    apparent from paragraph [45] of Appendix 1 to the decision, their legal
    representatives relied on their Kurdish ethnicity as an additional risk
    factor.  At paragraph [47] of Appendix 1, the Tribunal  summarised  the
    thrust of the expert evidence as follows:

       The  examples  contained  in  Dr  Kakhki's  report  in  relation  to
       imprisonment, torture and execution relate to  individuals  who  are
       reported  to  be  political  or  similar  activists  who  have  been
       convicted of other offences including  national  security  offences.
       The inference which Dr Kakhiki seeks to  draw  from  those  is  that
       being a Kurd does not in itself does not result in  prosecution  but
       when combined with other criminal suspicions, persecution "is likely
       to surface".

18. After summarising their conclusions on the country guidance  issues  in
    paragraph [33], the Tribunal  continued  in  paragraph  [34]  of  their
    decision as follows:

        It was not suggested to us that an individual faces risk  on  return
        on the sole basis of being Kurdish.  It was,  however,  agreed  that
        being Kurdish was relevant to how a returnee would be treated by the
        authorities.  For example, the Operation  Guidance  note  refers  at
        3.12.14 to  the  Government  disproportionately  targeting  minority
        groups including Kurds, for arbitrary arrests,  prolonged  detention
        and physical abuse.  No examples, however, have been provided of ill-
        treatment of returnees with no  relevant  adverse  interest  factors
        other than  their  Kurdish  ethnicity,  and  we  conclude  that  the
        evidence does not show risk  of  ill-treatment  of  such  returnees,
        though we accept that it might  be  an  exacerbating  factor  for  a
        returnee otherwise of interest.  Accordingly, we  conclude  that  it
        has not been shown that a person in the position of these appellants
        faces a real risk on return to Iran either  on  the  basis  of  what
        would happen to them when questioned at the airport or  subsequently
        if they were convicted of an offence of illegal exit.

19. Accordingly, I consider that  Judge  Shiner  was  right  to  treat  the
    Country Guidance case as applying to the appellant, and right to direct
    himself that he should treat the Country Guidance case as authoritative
    on the issue of the risk on return faced by the appellant,  insofar  as
    his appeal (a) related to the country guidance issue in question (which
    it clearly did) and (b) was dependent upon the same or similar evidence
    as that considered by the Upper Tribunal.

20. In evaluating whether the Judge has failed to give adequate reasons for
    declining to depart from the authoritative  Country  Guidance  directly
    applicable to the appellant, it is necessary to distinguish between two
    distinct strands of the expert report of Professor Joff�.   The  first,
    and main, strand of his report is that the Tribunal was simply wrong in
    their conclusions with regard to ethnic Kurds.  He refers back to  what
    he said in "Report A" of 15 October 2014, where he says that he pointed
    out that Kurds are generally treated with more discrimination  in  Iran
    than are other Iranians for reasons connected  with  the  situation  in
    Kurdistan, and therefore he finds himself substantially in disagreement
    with the conclusions  of  the  Tribunal  with  respect  to  Kurds.   He
    considers that Kurds face  an  increased  risk  of  persecution  simply
    because of  their  Kurdish  ethnicity.   He  also  considers  that  the
    Tribunal has under-estimated the potential difficulties associated with
    the acquisition of  laisser-passer  documentation,  a  point  which  he
    develops later on in his report at paragraphs 31-34.  He says  that  he
    does not see how an application for laisser-passer can be made  without
    potentially endangering its bearer.

21. The second, and more minor, strand  of  his  report  is  the  worsening
    security situation inside Iranian Kurdistan and the increased  domestic
    tensions that have arisen in consequence of the elections in  May  2016
    as the result of a struggle between moderates  and  hard-liners  around
    the new figure of the Supreme  Leader.   At  paragraphs  11-16  of  his
    report, Professor Joff� gives specific examples of the deterioration of
    the security situation inside Iranian Kurdistan  in  a  period  running
    from April 2016 through to 4 August 2016.

Pre-Country Guidance case evidence

22. Professor Joff�'s thesis as to the persecutory  risk  faced  by  ethnic
    Kurds is almost entirely based upon the same  or  similar  evidence  as
    that considered by the Upper Tribunal in the Country Guidance case. His
    criticism is not that the Upper Tribunal overlooked a raft of  evidence
    which completely changes the landscape, but that they  drew  the  wrong
    conclusions from the same body of evidence that he  was  commenting  on
    inter alia in Report A of 15 October 2014.

23. Accordingly, it is enough that the Judge should direct himself that the
    Country Guidance case is authoritative.  It was not open to  the  Judge
    to depart from the country guidance conclusions given by  the  Tribunal
    insofar as Professor Joff�'s criticisms of their conclusions are  based
    upon the same or similar evidence.

24. There is no  material  error  in  the  Judge  failing  to  explain  why
    Professor Joff�'s observations about the laisser-passer did not advance
    the appellant's case.  At paragraph [57], the Judge notes the criticism
    that  the  Tribunal  has  under-estimated  the  potential  difficulties
    connected with the acquisition of laisser-passer documentation, but  he
    does not make a specific finding as to whether this criticism  has  any
    merit.  However, it is apparent from the Country Guidance  case,  which
    the Judge adopts, that this criticism does  not  have  any  merit.   At
    paragraph [23] the Tribunal found as follows:

       In this regard, it is relevant return to Dr Kakhki's evidence in re-
       examination where he said the treatment  they  would  receive  would
       depend on their individual case.  If they  cooperated  and  accepted
       that they left illegally and claimed asylum abroad, then there would
       be no reason for ill-treatment,  and  questioning  would  be  for  a
       fairly brief period.  That seems to us to sum up the position  well,
       and as a consequence we conclude that a person of no  history  other
       than that of being a failed asylum seeker who had  exited  illegally
       and who could be expected to tell the truth when  questioned,  would
       not  face  a  real  risk  of  ill-treatment  during  the  period  of
       questioning at the airport.  We should add that we have no reason to
       doubt Dr Kakhki's evidence that there is a special Court at or  near
       the airport which considers the cases of returnees, but the evidence
       does not show a real risk of ill-treatment in breach  of  Article  3
       amounting to persecution as a consequence of attending at the Court.

25. The significance of  this  finding  by  the  Tribunal  is  that  it  is
    irrelevant that one of the requirements for obtaining a  laisser-passer
    from the Iranian Embassy is a letter from the  Home  Office  confirming
    that an application for asylum in Britain has been made, or a photocopy
    of a residence permit, as Professor Joff� says is the case in paragraph
    30 of his report.  For the Tribunal's  assessment  of  risk  on  return
    assumes that the Iranian authorities will obtain confirmation that  the
    bearer of the laisser-passer is a failed asylum seeker when the  bearer
    is questioned on arrival.  So the bearer of a laisser-passer  will  not
    be potentially endangered by having to declare to the  Iranian  embassy
    in the UK the same information which he can be expected to  declare  on
    arrival in Iran, namely that he is a failed asylum seeker.

Post-County Guidance evidence

26. As previously stated, a subsidiary strand of Professor  Joff�'s  expert
    report is directed towards recent events in 2016, some of  which  post-
    date the hearing in SSH and HR which took place in May 2016.

27. The Judge is alive  to  the  crucial  distinction  between  pre-country
    guidance evidence and post-country guidance evidence,  and  he  rightly
    considers it necessary only to comment on evidence of  incidents  which
    took place after the hearing in May 2016, as clearly the Tribunal  will
    not have taken such incidents into account.

28. The Judge refers at paragraph [57] to recent reports since May 2016  of
    incidents such as an attack by the Iranian authorities upon  the  PJAK,
    the execution of five human rights activists and outbreaks of  violence
    between the Kurdish political party and the authorities.    He  accepts
    Professor  Joff�'s   evidence   that   the   security   situation   has
    significantly worsened as a result of the  KDPI  renewing  hostilities,
    resulting in a series of executions of Kurdish militants.

29. The incidents identified by Professor Joff� do not include any examples
    of returning Kurdish failed asylum seekers being  prosecuted  or  being
    subjected to persecutory ill-treatment.  So, it was open to  the  Judge
    to find, for the reasons which he gave, that what he  characterised  as
    the  "change  in  circumstance"  did  not  transform  an   absence   of
    persecutory risk on return for the appellant, as indicated by  SSH  and
    HR, into a real risk of persecution, given that the appellant does  not
    have any profile beyond that of being a failed  Kurdish  asylum  seeker
    who has exited illegally.

Ground 2

30. The Tribunal in SSH and HR acknowledges  that  the  Iranian  Government
    disproportionately  targets  minority  groups,  including  Kurds,   for
    arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention and physical abuse.  Ground 2 is
    that the Judge erred in law  in  not  giving  reasons  as  to  why  the
    appellant would not thereby face very significant obstacles to his  re-
    integration into life and society in Iran.  I consider that this ground
    is merely argumentative. The  Judge  has  given  adequate  reasons  for
    finding that the appellant would not face very significant obstacles to
    his re-integration into life and society in Iran,  notwithstanding  any
    societal  disadvantage  of  the  Kurdish  community  in  Iran  and  the
    discriminatory  treatment  of  them  by  the  authorities,  which   the
    respondent accepts: see Appendix 1, paragraph 46. His  reasons  include
    the fact that the appellant only left the country recently, that he  is
    thus fully familiar with its customs, society and culture, and that  he
    has a family in Iran to whom he can turn for accommodation and support.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.

This appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
