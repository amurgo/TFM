Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Iqbal, Counsel (instructed by Britain
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1.    The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
           Tribunal  Judge  Lambert  on   31   March   2015   against   the
           determination of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  McIntosh  who  had
           dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
           State's decision dated 30  September  2014  in  a  determination
           promulgated on 2 February 2015.  The Appellant is a national  of
           Pakistan, who had applied for further leave to remain in Tier  1
           as an  Entrepreneur  Migrant.   This  was  refused  and  removal
           directions were made under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum
           and Nationality Act 2006.


      2.     Judge  McIntosh  found  that  that  the   Appellant   had   not
           demonstrated that the required funds of �50,000  were  available
           to him and dismissed the appeal on that basis.  The  judge  also
           found that the Respondent had not applied the Immigration  Rules
           in force as at the date of the application.

      3.    Judge Lambert considered it arguable  that  Judge  McIntosh  had
           erred in his approach in that the reasons for refusal letter had
           stated in terms  that  the  Appellant  had  provided  sufficient
           evidence of having access to �50,000.  It was reasonable to have
           inferred that the relevant supporting documents had been  before
           the decision maker although the judge had not recognised that.


      4.    The Respondent opposed the onwards appeal, by notice under  rule
           24 in the form of a letter to the Upper Tribunal dated 10  April
           2015.


      5.    Mr Iqbal for the Appellant submitted  that  Judge  McIntosh  had
           indeed fallen into legal error.   Important  documents  had  not
           been  included  in  the  Respondent's  bundle,   such   as   the
           Appellant's solicitors' covering letter, bank statements and the
           bank's covering letter.  It was obvious such materials must have
           existed and that they had not been copied  because  the  reasons
           for refusal letter had accepted that funds were  available,  not
           only for investment but also for  maintenance.   10  points  had
           been awarded for maintenance.   The  relevant  rules  were  very
           complex and it was easy to go wrong.


      6.    The judge had set out at [16] and [17] of his determination what
           he considered were the competing  versions  of  the  Immigration
           Rules.  He had followed the version set out at [16] at [21]  and
           [22] of his determination, but had then fallen into error as  to
           what was in issue before the First-tier Tribunal.   He  had  not
           been helped by the Respondent's failure to follow rule 24 of the
           2014 Tribunal Procedure Rules, by neglecting to serve documents.


      7.    Mr Avery for the Respondent accepted that the judge  had  fallen
           into legal error, although not  on  the  grounds  argued  by  Mr
           Iqbal.  The determination was frankly  baffling.   This  was  at
           least in part due to the  misleading  submissions  made  on  the
           Appellant's  behalf  at  the  first   instance   hearing.    The
           contention that the Respondent had applied the wrong Immigration
           Rules when reaching  her  decision  on  30  September  2014  was
           plainly wrong.  To illustrate his point, Mr  Avery  produced  an
           archive edition of the Immigration Rules in force at the date of
           the application (6  August  2014),  and  also  referred  to  the
           application form in the Respondent's bundle.  This  showed  (see
           page 35 of the application form, Q.G26) that the  relevant  date
           of before  11  July  2014  was  to  be  applied.   It  was  also
           noteworthy that Q.G27 of the  application  from  had  been  left
           blank, which  was  an  admission  that  the  Appellant  had  not
           submitted all of the specified documents.  The basis of  refusal
           was thus correct.  The appeal had  indeed  gone  wrong  but  the
           result was right because the appeal could never have succeeded.


      8.     Mr  Iqbal  in  reply  submitted  that  with  reference  to  the
           Appellant's advertising flyer, which  was  in  the  Respondent's
           bundle, all that  was  missing  was  the  date.   The  printer's
           invoice had been supplied by the Appellant, which gave a date of
           13 May 2014, i.e., prior to  11  July  2014.   Hence  there  was
           reason to believe that the paragraph 41-SD  of  the  Immigration
           Rules had or might have been met.  Thus paragraph 245AA  of  the
           Immigration Rules ought to have  been  applied  and  the  appeal
           should have been allowed by the judge to that extent.  The  same
           point applied to the contract relied on by the Appellant,  which
           was open ended.  That was still a valid contract in English  law
           and the Immigration Rules ought to be interpreted to reflect the
           wider legal position.


      9.    As Mr Iqbal had made fresh submissions in his reply, effectively
           on the basis that the determination  could  not  stand,  it  was
           appropriate to allow Mr Avery to respond.  He submitted that the
           Immigration Rules were specific and that the  contract  was  not
           compliant with  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iv)(1)(d).   Thus  paragraph
           245AA could not assist the Appellant.


      10.   The tribunal reserved its determination which now  follows.   It
           was accepted by both parties that  the  judge  had  fallen  into
           material error of law.  The Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  rules
           are not only complex but have also  been  changed  a  number  of
           times.   Although  the  judge  quite   reasonably   looked   for
           assistance to the parties' representatives who  appeared  before
           him, Mr Avery demonstrated beyond  doubt  that  the  Appellant's
           representative (not Mr Iqbal) had produced an incorrect  set  of
           archived Immigration Rules at the first instance  hearing.   The
           judge can hardly be blamed for that.  It is inevitable that  the
           judge erred as a result.


      11.   The second error of law was that the  judge  reached  a  finding
           which was contrary to the reasons  for  refusal  letter.   While
           that may be  possible  in  strict  legal  theory  under  certain
           circumstances, here there had been a reasoned acceptance by  the
           Respondent that the required funds were  available.   Hence  the
           Respondent had  not  copied  the  evidence  of  funds  into  the
           Respondent's bundle, since there was no issue on  the  point  as
           the reasons for refusal letter made clear.  It was not  open  to
           the judge to reach the  contrary  finding  he  made,  which  was
           against the accepted facts and which was unfair to the Appellant
           who had not been prepared to produce evidence which was  not  in
           dispute.


      12.   It follows that the decision and reasons  cannot  stand  and  is
           hereby set aside.


      13.   Both representatives made submissions enabling the  tribunal  to
           remake the decision on the basis of the existing evidence.   The
           Immigration Rules in force are those in the Home Office  archive
           for the period 1 August to  20  October  2014,  the  Immigration
           Rules correctly applied as at the date of the  decision  on  the
           Appellant's application made on 6 August 2014.   (That  was  the
           version which should have been supplied by both parties to Judge
           McIntosh but which regrettably was not.)


      14.   As Mr Avery submitted, the application form in the  Respondent's
           bundle shows that the Appellant failed to provide the  specified
           evidence: inter alia Q.G27 was left blank.  The application  was
           defective.


      15.   Moreover, the contract relied on  by  the  Appellant  failed  to
           comply with paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv)(1)(d).  Even if the  contract
           in fact produced as found in the  Respondent's  bundle  was  the
           contract intended to be referred to at Q.G27 and the box had not
           been ticked in error, the contract's duration  was  not  stated.
           There  was  no  scope  for  paragraph  245AA  to   be   applied,
           notwithstanding  Mr  Iqbal's  submission  in  relating  to   the
           advertising material [paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii)(1)] which was well
           founded.  But that covered only part of the specified documents.
           Mr Iqbal's submission that the contract was valid in English law
           despite the failure to state its duration was, of course,  right
           in terms of its potential  for  enforcement  inter  partes,  but
           compliance with the Immigration Rules  is  a  different  matter,
           where  different  public  policy  considerations   apply.    The
           Appellant had to meet  the  specific  requirements  approved  by
           parliament.


      16.   The tribunal finds that the Appellant has  failed  to  meet  the
           requirements of paragraph 41-SD, as stated in  the  reasons  for
           refusal letter.  The appeal must accordingly be dismissed.


      DECISION


      The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on
      a point of law.   The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.
