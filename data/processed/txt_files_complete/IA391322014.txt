                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mr Ishtiaq Raheem, was born on 28 April 1989  and  is  a
    male citizen of Pakistan.  He entered the United  Kingdom  in  February
    2011 as a student.  He had subsequently applied for leave to remain  on
    the basis of his family life as  a  partner  in  April  2014  but  that
    application was  refused  provisionally  under  the  Immigration  Rules
    pending the outcome of the appeal of  the  Secretary  of  State  in  MM
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  Following the judgment of the Court of Appeal  in
    MM, the appellant's application was finally refused on 27 May 2014  and
    the appellant was given three weeks within which to  submit  a  further
    application and/or documents in support.  His appeal was determined  on
    the papers by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge G D  Tobin)  which,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 30 January 2015,  dismissed  the  appeal.   The
    appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant attended the Upper Tribunal hearing at Bradford on 1 June
    2015.  Mrs R  Pettersen,  a  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,
    appeared for the respondent.

 3. Mrs Pettersen submitted to me that the offer made by the  Secretary  of
    State to the appellant to supply further evidence made clear  that  the
    evidence in question should  be  financial  documentation  showing  the
    circumstances of the sponsor and appellant in the period of six  months
    prior to the making of the  original  application;  evidence  submitted
    after the decision relating to a period after the date  of  application
    could not be taken into  account.   Mrs  Pettersen  did  not,  however,
    disagree with the appellant's submission that that  evidence  indicated
    that his wife now earns sufficient income to enable  the  appellant  to
    cross the income threshold of ï¿½18,600 per annum.   The  judge,  in  Mrs
    Pettersen's submission,  had  correctly  found  that  "the  appellant's
    spouse's salary had subsequently increased [following the submission of
    the application] but ... the only evidence that could be  accepted  was
    that related to the  appellant's  circumstances  at  the  time  it  was
    accepted for consideration (sic)."  [8]

 4. I agree with Mrs Pettersen.  As I explained to the  appellant  and  his
    wife at the hearing, if they are now able to  meet  the  financial  and
    other criteria for leave to remain, then the proper course of action is
    for the appellant to submit a new application.  I found that the  judge
    was entirely correct at [22] to find that "the application was made  on
    9 April 2014 and it is  at  that  point  that  the  assessment  relates
    although the applicant had the benefit of additional time to obtain the
    required documentation."

 5. The judge had also considered EX.1 of Appendix FM.  He noted  that  the
    respondent  considered  that  the  appellant  had   not   "raised   any
    'insurmountable obstacles' as to why he and/or  his  spouse  could  not
    pursue family life in his home country or elsewhere."  The judge  noted
    that the appellant had "spent all of his formative years  in  Pakistan,
    22 years in total, he provided no evidence to show that  there  was  or
    would be any problems with re-integrating to Pakistan."  As regards the
    appellant's wife, it was clear that, although  she  would  suffer  some
    disruption to her social and wider family life and her  employment,  it
    could not be argued that she would  face  insurmountable  obstacles  in
    relocating to enjoy her family life with the appellant in Pakistan.   I
    find that the judge was also correct to note that this was an appeal in
    which the circumstances of the appellant and his spouse were adequately
    covered  by  the  Immigration  Rules;   there   were   no   exceptional
    circumstances not covered by those Rules such as might justify a  grant
    of leave to remain under Article 8 ECHR.

 6. This is an unfortunate case in which the appellant has narrowly  failed
    to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  However, I am in no
    doubt that the judge came to the right  decision  and,  in  particular,
    correctly excluded evidence of the appellant's and sponsor's  financial
    circumstances which post-dated the date of the original application.  I
    am satisfied that the appellant was not  misled  by  the  Secretary  of
    State's invitation to him to supply further  evidence  appertaining  to
    his circumstances prior to the date of the application.  However, as  I
    have already noted, it is open to  the  appellant  to  make  a  further
    application providing particulars of his wife's earnings which may  now
    meet the necessary provisions and it  is  to  hoped  that  this  failed
    application and appeal will not count against him.
