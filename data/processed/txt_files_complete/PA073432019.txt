                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr U Aslam, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against  the  decision  of  FtT  Judge  Farrelly,
    promulgated on 15 October 2019.

 2. The grounds are set out  in  an  application  dated  29  October  2019.
    Paragraphs 1 and 5 are directed  against  the  FtT's  treatment  of  an
    expert report.  Paragraphs 2 and 3 maintain that the FtT  left  out  of
    account evidence of a connection between  the  appellant's  family  and
    [MS], and failed to say why witness evidence of that connection did not
    advance the case.  (Paragraph 4 is narrative.)

 3. Mr Clark conceded that the FtT  erred  at  [37]  by  stating  that  the
    evidence of a witness did not advance  the  appeal,  without  giving  a
    reason, either there or elsewhere in the decision; and that  the  error
    was sufficient to require a remit.

 4. That was the outcome sought by Mr Aslam.  It is unnecessary to  resolve
    the grounds any further.

 5. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 6. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 7. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Farrelly.

 8. The FtT made an anonymity direction, which is maintained herein.
