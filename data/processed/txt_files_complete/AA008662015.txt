                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of MYSC against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Birkby promulgated 25.3.15, dismissing on all grounds his  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  30.12.14,  to
    refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims, and
    to remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 4.3.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    21.4.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 31.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Birkby should be set aside.

 5. In summary, the grounds  assert  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    undertook a review of a selection of evidence from the asylum interview
    on which reliance was placed to make adverse  credibility  findings  on
    issues not raised during the oral evidence, such that this  amounts  to
    procedural unfairness.

 6. It is also pleaded that the judge gave inadequate reasons for rejecting
    the appellant's claim to have travelled to Iraq and having received  an
    offer from the Canoeing Federation of Iraqi  Kurdistan.  The  appellant
    contends that the Secretary of State now accepts that detention in Iran
    gives rise to a real risk of persecution or article 3 ill-treatment and
    whether or not an asylum seeker is accepted to have left Iran illegally
    is not determinative given the evidence cited by the Secretary of State
    in her own OGN at 3.15.5. It  is  submitted  that  the  key  issue  was
    whether  the  appellant  faced  a  real  risk  of  detention  and  that
    significant evidence postdating the country guidance cases pointing  to
    such a risk was before the First-tier Tribunal Judge. It is argued

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Osborne considered that  in  an
    otherwise  detailed  and  carefully  reasoned  decision   and   reasons
    extending to 10 pages and 47 paragraphs, "it  is  nonetheless  arguable
    that the Judge has failed  to  adequately  consider  the  risk  to  the
    appellant upon his being returned to Iran. It is arguable that to  fail
    to adequately deal with this issue is a material  error  of  law.  This
    arguable error of law having been identified, all the issues raised  in
    the grounds are arguable."

 8. The ground of appeal  alleging  that  the  judge  had  used  the  wrong
    standard of proof was not pursued at the hearing before me.

 9. I find no error of law in the first  ground  complaining  that  it  was
    unfair for the judge to rely on inconsistencies  in  the  interview  to
    make adverse credibility findings.  It  is  suggested  that  the  judge
    should have given the appellant the opportunity to address the concerns
    referred to by the judge. As they  were  not  raised  during  the  oral
    hearing, it is suggested that this amounts to unfairness. It  is  clear
    from �30 that the judge carefully considered the  appellant's  evidence
    within the context of the background situation in Iran and took note of
    all the evidence and submissions made. The matters  relied  on  by  the
    judge were within the evidence put before the Tribunal. The judge found
    the appellant's evidence inconsistent, evasive, vague and  implausible.
    The judge then went on to cite some examples, making  clear  they  were
    not exhaustive of the concerns.

10. At �38 the judge found he was never involved in  any  attempt  to  seek
    information about moving to Iraq, or that he  was  offered  a  canoeing
    role there, or that his father  was  ever  involved  with  a  political
    party, or imprisoned, or that the appellant was himself ever  arrested,
    detained, ill-treated, and released on bail,  with  an  arrest  warrant
    issued against him. The judge did not accept  that  he  had  ever  been
    accused of being politically involved with any party, or  discriminated
    against because of his Kurdish ethnicity, or mistreated because of  any
    imputed political opinion.  Neither  did  the  judge  accept  that  the
    appellant left Iran illegally.  In  fact,  the  judge  found  that  the
    appellant had fabricated his  entire  account  of  detention  and  ill-
    treatment in order to make a false claim for international protection.

11. It is true that some of the issues raised by the judge in the  decision
    were not specifically addressed in the reasons for refusal letter,  but
    it is clear from the refusal at page 5 onwards that  the  Secretary  of
    State did not accept that the  appellant  faced  charges  in  Iran  for
    encouraging athletes to go to Iraq and that his general credibility was
    in issue. The Secretary of State asserted that his evidence claiming to
    suffer discrimination was inconsistent with his account of being funded
    in Iran in the manner claimed.  The  refusal  decision  concluded  that
    inconsistencies  in  his  account  led  to  the  conclusion  that   the
    circumstances around his claimed canoeing career  are  not  as  he  has
    alleged. Inconsistencies in his interviews were also  highlighted.  His
    claim that he intended to remain in Iran to see if he  was  picked  for
    the next cup was found to be inconsistent with his claim to  have  been
    discriminated against and to have been made an offer in Iraq. His claim
    to have returned to Iran and  encouraged  fellow  canoeists  to  go  to
    represent Iraq was also found to be inconsistent.

12. In the circumstances, I find that the judge was perfectly  entitled  to
    rely on similar inconsistencies and implausibilities in the appellant's
    self-contradictory accounts as part of the judge's  assessment  of  his
    credibility. At �31 it is clear that  the  judge  was  considering  the
    appellant's credibility in the  round  in  the  light  of  all  of  the
    evidence. There was no unfairness to the appellant  in  so  doing.  The
    appellant knew the evidence that was placed before the judge and cannot
    complain  that  the  judge  examined  that  evidence  and  found  other
    inconsistencies and a lack of credibility that may not have been relied
    on by the Secretary of State.

13. In relation to the second ground relied on by Ms  Mason,  that  of  the
    risk on return as a failed asylum seeker. Although the judge found as a
    fact that the appellant had not made an unlawful exit from Iran, it was
    nevertheless submitted that the judge failed to consider  the  risk  on
    return as an undocumented Iranian. Reliance was placed on  passages  in
    the 2013 COIR at 32.27 and OGN at 3.15.5 & 3.17.13, now  very  familiar
    to the Tribunal, citing an Amnesty International report citing in  turn
    a report issued by a Swiss refugee agency  which  allegedly  quotes  an
    unnamed judge as saying that asylum seekers are interrogated on  return
    and that this includes people who are deported  back  to  Iran  not  in
    possession of a passport containing an exit visa, but only  a  document
    from the embassy confirming their identity.

14. In the refusal decision, the Secretary of State relied on  the  Country
    Guidance case law of SB (risk on return -illegal exit) Iran  CG  [2009]
    UKAIT 00053, and BA (demonstrators in Britain - risk on return) Iran CG
    [2011] UKUT 00036 (IAC),  to  the  effect  that  even  if  they  exited
    illegally those facing enforced return do not in general  face  a  real
    risk of persecution or  ill-treatment  and  illegal  exit  is  not,  by
    itself, a real risk factor.

15. The argument is that the COIR and other  background  information  post-
    dates the country guidance.  However,  in  DSG  &  Ors  (Afghan  Sikhs:
    Departure from CG) Afghanistan [2013], and SG (Iran)  [2012]  EWCA  Civ
    940, it was held that  unless  it  has  been  expressly  superseded  or
    replace by any later CG determination, or is  inconsistent  with  other
    authority that is binding on the Tribunal, such a country guidance case
    is authority in any subsequent appeal, and  that  decision  makers  and
    Tribunal judges are required to take  country  guidance  determinations
    into account, and to follow them, "unless very strong grounds supported
    by cogent evidence, are adduced, justifying their not doing so.  To  do
    otherwise would amount to an error of law."

16. I agree with the submission of Ms Pettersen that the COIR  and  Amnesty
    International evidence relied on by the appellants is  insufficient  to
    displace the current country guidance relied on by the judge. There are
    obvious shortcomings in the  relied  on  passages.  One  is  distinctly
    lacking in detail, with no examples cited,  and  the  other  refers  to
    existing laws cited by an unnamed judge.  These  articles  or  extracts
    post-date the CG, but on the test for departing from CG, set out above,
    the background material cannot be described as cogent or  amounting  to
    strong  grounds  to  depart  from  the   country   guidance.   In   the
    circumstances, there was no material error in the failure of the  judge
    to consider a risk on return as an undocumented failed asylum seeker.

17. The remaining grounds of appeal  are  much  weaker  and  whether  taken
    together or as a whole do not demonstrate any error of law on the  part
    of the judge. Much of the points made are merely  a  disagreement  with
    the findings or are otherwise  misguided.  For  example,   �21  of  the
    grounds complains that  the  judge  does  not  reject  the  appellant's
    claimed Al Haq faith and failed to apply this to  the  risk  on  return
    assessment. However, the judge addressed this at �40 noting that on his
    own evidence that he did not practice his faith and  had  not  suffered
    any problems as an adult in consequence of  his  parents  adherence  to
    this faith. The judge concluded that the appellant never  suffered  any
    serious problems in Iran because of his religion and was not  satisfied
    that he would seek to proselytise, promote or even practice this  faith
    on return.

Conclusions:

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

     The appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
