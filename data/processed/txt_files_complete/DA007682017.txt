For the Respondent:    Ms C Robinson, of Counsel, instructed by Bindman's
LLP.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State with the permission of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  (FtT)  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Herbert) promulgated on 30 October  2018  allowing  the
    appeal of the Respondent, Natacha [N], against the Secretary of State's
    decision of 20 December 2017  to  make  a  deportation  order  for  her
    deportation to Bulgaria.

 2. For the following reasons we dismiss the Secretary  of  State's  appeal
    and uphold the decision of the FtT.

Background

 3. The Respondent is a Bulgarian national. She arrived in the UK in  1997,
    prior to Bulgaria joining the European Union on 1 January 2007. She was
    dependent on her mother's asylum claim, which was refused on 10 January
    1998.

 4. On 9 January 2003 the Respondent was issued with an EEA residence  card
    valid until 12 November 2007.   That  was  as  the  spouse  of  an  EEA
    national, her husband being Portuguese.   On  4  March  2004,  she  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain as the dependent of her mother.

 5. Bulgaria joined the EU on 1 January 2007.

 6. On 21 April 2016 the Respondent was convicted of kidnapping  and  false
    imprisonment at Isleworth Crown  Court.   She  had  been  arrested  and
    remanded in custody for this offence in 2015.  On 13 May 2016  she  was
    sentenced to seven years imprisonment (which was reduced on appeal to 6
    years in prison). The Respondent was involved with her sister, [RT], in
    the kidnapping, false imprisonment and robbery of a young woman whom we
    shall call T.   Ms [RT] and T were involved in a dispute over  a  young
    man which led to what the judge described as  'a  vicious,  wicked  and
    undoubtedly premeditated attack upon an innocent young woman', that  is
    to say, T.   A plan was hatched to kidnap and  assault  T.   The  judge
    said that the Respondent had been 'instrumental' in the creation of the
    plan and that she had demonstrated 'a cold ruthlessness in relation  to
    the creation of  the  plant  itself'.  T  was  ambushed  when  she  was
    returning from work one evening and forced into a car.   Then, during a
    period of about an hour and a half, she was punched and beaten  in  the
    car.  She was then removed from the car and assaulted with a  piece  of
    wood, possibly a baseball bat. She suffered injuries to  her  face  and
    body which took her some time to recover from.   She also had  to  have
    an operation on her back.   This was, as  the  judge  said,  a  serious
    attack.

 7. Following her sentencing, on 23 June 2016  the  Respondent  was  served
    with a notice of liability to deportation (ICD 4932).    She  submitted
    representations in response, however on 20 December 2017 the  Secretary
    of State took the decision to deport the Respondent, which  was  served
    on the same date (the Decision Letter).

 8. As the citizen of an EEA state the decision to  deport  the  Respondent
    was made under the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2016  (SI  2016/1052)  (the  2016  Regulations).  The  decision  letter
    indicated that the Secretary of State had concluded that the Respondent
    had not obtained  permanent  residence  in  accordance  with  the  2016
    Regulations because there was no  evidence  of  her  exercising  treaty
    rights  for  five  years  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations.   The
    Secretary of State said, therefore, that consideration had  been  given
    to whether her deportation was justified on grounds of public policy or
    public security, in accordance with reg  23(6)(b)  and  reg  27(1)  (as
    opposed to the test of serious grounds  of  public  policy  and  public
    security which would have applied  had  the  Secretary  of  State  been
    satisfied about the five year condition, per reg 27(3)). The  Secretary
    of State also said he did not  accept  that  the  Respondent  had  been
    continuously resident in the UK  for  10  years,  and  so  consequently
    consideration had not been be given  to  whether  her  deportation  was
    justified on imperative  grounds  of  public  security  (which  is  the
    applicable test for such a person pursuant to reg 27(4)).

 9. The Secretary of State's conclusion in relation to the 2016 Regulations
    was as follows:

         "You have committed  a  serious  criminal  offence  in  the  United
         Kingdom and, as explained above,  the  professional  assessment  is
         that there is a real risk that you may re-offend in the future. You
         have made representations and account  has  been  taken  of  these.
         Nevertheless, for the reasons set out above, and in particular  the
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat you pose to one of
         the  fundamental  interests  of  United  Kingdom  society,  it   is
         considered that your deportation is justified on grounds of  public
         policy,  public  security  or  public  health  in  accordance  with
         regulation  23(6)(b).  Your  personal   circumstances   have   been
         considered but our view is that, given the  threat  you  pose,  the
         decision to deport you is proportionate and in accordance with  the
         principles of regulations 27(3) and (6)."

10. The Secretary of State went on to reject  the  Respondent's  contention
    that deportation would be incompatible with her rights under Article  8
    of the European Convention on Human Rights.

11. The Decision Letter therefore concluded:

         "Your representations made pursuant to the [2016  Regulations]  and
         your human rights claim are hereby refused and it has been  decided
         to deport you in accordance with regulation 23(6)(b) and regulation
         27 of the [2016 Regulations]."

12. The Respondent was released on licence on 29 October 2018 and is due to
    remain on licence (and thus liable to recall) until 2021.

13. The Respondent appealed in time to the FtT  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision.

The decision of the FtT

14. On the appeal, and contrary to the conclusion in the  Decision  Letter,
    the Secretary of State accepted that the Respondent did have  permanent
    residence because she had resided in the UK in accordance with the 2016
    Regulations for a continuous period of five years.  That concession was
    based  upon  evidence  submitted  by  the  Respondent  on  the  appeal.
    Accordingly, the Secretary of  State  accepted  that  the  decision  to
    deport  the  Respondent  could  only  be  justified  according  to  the
    heightened standard of 'serious grounds of  public  policy  and  public
    security' contained in reg 27(3), and thus that the standard  that  had
    been applied in  the  Decision  Letter  of  public  policy  and  public
    security simpliciter was not the correct test.  However, the  Secretary
    of State did not accept that  the  Respondent  had  10  years  or  more
    continuous  residence  counting  backwards  from  the   date   of   the
    deportation decision by reason of her  imprisonment  between  2016  and
    2018, and therefore did not  accept  that  deportation  could  only  be
    justified on 'imperative grounds of public security' in accordance with
    reg 27(4): FV (Italy) v Secretary of State for the Home Department; B v
    Land Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg [2018] 3 WLR 1035 (CJEU).

15. Against that background, the Respondent submitted on  the  appeal  that
    she did not pose any risk to the public.   She  relied  on  her  family
    circumstances, including  her  supportive  children  and  husband,  and
    evidence from a social  worker  that  she  posed  a  low  risk  of  re-
    offending.   She had addressed her offending behaviour  positively  and
    there had been no disciplinary matters recorded against her in  prison.
     She relied on evidence  that  to  deport  her  to  Bulgaria  would  be
    damaging for her children (aged 7 and 11 at the date of the decision to
    deport her)  for  whom  she  had  been  the  primary  carer  until  her
    imprisonment.

16. The Secretary of State submitted in response that the test in reg 27(3)
    was satisfied because of the seriousness of the offence  of  which  the
    Respondent had been convicted, the punishment which had  been  imposed,
    and the medium risk of harm to the public and unknown adults which  she
    had been assessed as posing.   He submitted that consideration  of  the
    factors in reg 27(5) and those in Sch 1 justified deportation according
    to the test in reg 27(3) in light of the Respondent's offending.

17. In his decision the judge directed himself that the burden of proof lay
    upon the Respondent on the balance of probabilities. He  also  directed
    himself that the relevant date was the date of the decision  (i.e.,  20
    December 2017) because this was an in-country appeal.

18. At [59] et seq the judge set out his Findings of  Fact  and  Law.    He
    said he had been referred to the case of FV, supra, and he set out [72]-
    [73] of the judgment.  We will return to that case later.  He said that
    he found there was 'overwhelming' evidence,  on  the  question  whether
    there had been 10 years continuous residency broken by  the  period  of
    the Respondent's imprisonment, that the Respondent had  been  genuinely
    rooted in the UK with her family and children before she committed  her
    offence and that nothing since her sentence of imprisonment has changed
    that matrix.   He said her bond with the UK had deepened and  that  her
    bonds with her children and her husband  had  strengthened  during  her
    time in prison.  The judge said at [66]:

         "The consequences therefore taking all this into account  are  that
         the continuity of her residency in the UK had not been  removed  by
         her period of incarceration but I recognise  it  clearly  has  been
         stress tested to the extreme."

19. At [70] the judge directed himself that the test to be applied was  the
    'imperative grounds  of  public  security,  public  policy  and  public
    health' test.  He said he recognised that the Respondent's offence  was
    'extremely serious' but also noted that the risk  of  her  re-offending
    was described as low in  the  OASys  report.   He  concluded  that  the
    Respondent did not pose a  'genuinely  present  and  sufficient  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interest  of  the  society'  (sic,  at
    [72]).

20. He said that the Respondent's offence did not fall at the 'top  end  of
    the scale in terms of public policy'. Hence, he said that her offending
    did not satisfy the test in Land Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg v Tsakouridis  (Case
    C-145/09), [41], where the CJEU said that:

         "...  the  concept  of  'imperative  grounds  of  public  security'
         presupposes not only the existence of a threat to public  security,
         but also that such a threat is of a  particularly  high  degree  of
         seriousness, as is reflected by the use of  the  words  'imperative
         reasons'."

21. He also said that the risk of reoffending must inform consideration  of
    whether there were 'imperative' grounds:  Straszewski  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2016] 1 WLR 1173.

22. The judge also said, on the question of rehabilitation, (per Essa (EEA:
    rehabilitation/reintegration) [2013] UKUT 316 (IAC)) that it  was  more
    likely that the Respondent would be rehabilitated in  the  UK  than  in
    Bulgaria, in essence because of the presence of her children here.

23. Accordingly, the judge allowed the  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    Respondent's deportation could not be justified on 'imperative  grounds
    of public security'.  He therefore did  not  determine  her  Article  8
    claim but allowed her appeal on EEA grounds.

The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal

24. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper  Tribunal  on  the  single
    ground, namely, that the FtT made a material misdirection of law.    He
    argued the FtT had been wrong to conclude that the Respondent had  been
    continuously resident in the UK for 10 years prior to the decision,  in
    light of her conviction and imprisonment between 2016 and 2018  for  an
    extremely serious offence.  It was argued that the FtT  had  failed  to
    consider the serious  of  the  consequences  of  re-offending  and  had
    erroneously found that deportation to another  EU  member  state  would
    jeopardise her rehabilitation because of  the  absence  of  her  family
    (there being evidence that her husband would not allow  their  children
    to return to Bulgaria).

25. In response, the Respondent  submitted  that  the  judge  had  directed
    himself correctly on the proper legal approach as set out in FV,  supra
    (a decision which the Secretary of State accepted set out  the  correct
    approach). She submitted that the FtT had  undertaken  a  detailed  and
    holistic approach and reached sustainable conclusions on  the  evidence
    before it.

Legal principles

26. The 2016 Regulations consolidate  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area)  Regulations  2006  (SI  2006/1003)  (the  2006  Regulations)  as
    amended, and implement Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament
    and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right  of  citizens  of  the
    Union and their family members to move and  reside  freely  within  the
    territory of the member States (OJ No L 158, 30.4.04,  p77)  (the  Free
    Movement Directive).

27. The relevant parts of regs 15, 23 and 27 provide:

         "Right of permanent residence

         15.      (1)  The following persons acquire the right to reside  in
             the United Kingdom permanently -

               a) an EEA national who has resided in the United  Kingdom  in
                  accordance with these Regulations for a continuous  period
                  of five years;

         ...

         Exclusion and removal from the United Kingdom

         23.      ...

             (6) Subject to paragraphs (7) and (8), an EEA national who has
             entered the United Kingdom or the  family  member  of  such  a
             national who has entered the United Kingdom may be removed  if
             -

                  ...

                  (b)  the Secretary of State has decided that the  person's
                  removal is justified on grounds of public  policy,  public
                  security or public health in  accordance  with  regulation
                  27;

         ...

         Decisions taken on grounds of public policy,  public  security  and
         public health

         27.      (1)  In this regulation, a "relevant  decision"  means  an
             EEA decision taken on the grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health.

             (2) A relevant decision may not be  taken  to  serve  economic
             ends.

             (3) A relevant decision may not  be  taken  in  respect  of  a
             person with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15
             except  on  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  and   public
             security.

             (4) A relevant decision may not be taken except on  imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

               a) has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period
                  of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or

               b) is under the age of 18, unless the relevant decision is in
                  the best interests of the person  concerned,  as  provided
                  for in the Convention on the Rights of the  Child  adopted
                  by the General Assembly of  the  United  Nations  on  20th
                  November 1989.

             (5) The public policy and public security requirements of  the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise  conferred
             by these Regulations  in  order  to  protect  the  fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision  is  taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-

                  (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                  proportionality;

                  (b)   the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                  personal conduct of the person concerned;

                  (c)  the personal conduct of the person must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision;

                  (f)  the decision may be taken  on  preventative  grounds,
                  even in the absence of  a  previous  criminal  conviction,
                  provided the grounds are specific to the person."

28. Hence, in summary, the 2016 Regulations set out a three-tiered approach
    to the removal of EEA nationals on public  policy  grounds.  Those  who
    have acquired a right of permanent residence in the UK  enjoy  enhanced
    protection against deportation as compared with  those  who  have  not.
    The degree of protection, pursuant to the 2016 regulations and relevant
    case-law, varies as follows:

      a. An EEA  national  who  has  a  right  of  permanent  residence  and
         (counting backwards  from  the  date  of  the  decision)  10  years
         continuous residence, who has become integrated  into  the  UK  and
         whose  integration  has  not  been  broken  by  any  period(s)   of
         imprisonment may only be removed on 'imperative grounds  of  public
         security' (reg 27(4)(a)).

      b. A person who does not satisfy this condition, but who has  a  right
         of permanent residence under  reg  15,  may  only  be  removed  'on
         serious grounds of public policy and public security' (reg 27(3).

      c. A person who does not satisfy either of  these  conditions  may  be
         removed 'on grounds of public policy,  public  security  or  public
         health in accordance with regulation 27' (reg 23(6)(b)).

29. In the present case, in his decision letter the Secretary of State held
    that the Respondent fell into the third of these  categories.   On  the
    appeal to the FtT, he conceded that this was wrong  and  accepted  that
    she fell into the second category, but not  the  first  category.   The
    Respondent submitted, and the judge found,  that  the  Respondent  fell
    into the first category, and that there were not 'imperative grounds of
    public security' properly justifying her removal under reg 27(4)(a).

30. In FV (Italy), supra, the Grand Chamber of the CJEU considered the Free
    Movement Directive in this context.  The  relevant  provisions  of  the
    Directive that were in issue are as follows:

         "Article 16

         1. Union citizens who have resided legally for a continuous  period
         of five years in the host Member State  shall  have  the  right  of
         permanent residence there. This right shall not be subject  to  the
         conditions provided for in Chapter III.

         3. Continuity of residence  shall  not  be  affected  by  temporary
         absences not exceeding a total of six months a year, or by absences
         of a longer duration for compulsory military  service,  or  by  one
         absence of a maximum of 12 consecutive months for important reasons
         such  as  pregnancy  and  childbirth,  serious  illness,  study  or
         vocational training, or a posting in  another  Member  State  or  a
         third country.

         4. Once acquired, the right of permanent residence  shall  be  lost
         only through absence from  the  host  Member  State  for  a  period
         exceeding two consecutive years

         ...

         Article 27

         General principles

         1. Subject to the provisions of this  Chapter,  Member  States  may
         restrict the freedom of movement and residence  of  Union  citizens
         and their family members, irrespective of nationality,  on  grounds
         of public policy, public security or public health.  These  grounds
         shall not be invoked to serve economic ends.

         2. Measures taken on grounds of public policy  or  public  security
         shall comply with the principle of  proportionality  and  shall  be
         based  exclusively  on  the  personal  conduct  of  the  individual
         concerned. Previous criminal convictions shall  not  in  themselves
         constitute grounds for taking such measures.

         ...

         Article 28 Protection against expulsion

         1. Before taking an expulsion decision on grounds of public  policy
         or public security, the host Member State  shall  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  how  long  the  individual  concerned  has
         resided on its territory, his/her age, state of health, family  and
         economic situation, social and cultural integration into  the  host
         Member State and the extent of his/her links with  the  country  of
         origin.

         2. The host Member State may not take an expulsion decision against
         Union  citizens  or   their   family   members,   irrespective   of
         nationality, who have the  right  of  permanent  residence  on  its
         territory, except on serious grounds of  public  policy  or  public
         security.

         3. An expulsion decision may not be taken against  Union  citizens,
         except if the decision is based on  imperative  grounds  of  public
         security, as defined by Member States, if they: (a) have resided in
         the host Member State for the previous ten  years;  or  (b)  are  a
         minor, except if the expulsion is necessary for the best  interests
         of the child, as provided for in the United Nations  Convention  on
         the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989."

  31. In the first of two joined cases the  claimant,  FV,  was  an  Italian
      national who had moved to the UK where he had lived  continuously  for
      over 30 years, although he had no right of permanent residence  there.
      He married his wife in  the  UK  and  his  children  were  born  here.
      Following his conviction for manslaughter, the claimant was  sentenced
      to eight years' imprisonment. After his release in July 2006 the  Home
      Secretary  determined  to  deport  him  under  reg  21  of  the   2006
      Regulations, which were intended to implement Articles 27  and  28  of
      the Free Movement Directive. The claimant's challenge to that decision
      subsequently gave rise to an appeal before the  Supreme  Court,  which
      had been twice adjourned pending the determination of other cases.  In
      support of the expulsion decision, the  Home  Secretary  argued  that,
      having been in prison between 2001 and  2006,  the  claimant  had  not
      acquired a right of permanent residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
      could not, therefore, enjoy enhanced protection under Article 28(3)(a)
      of the Directive. The Supreme Court considered that, since no right of
      permanent residence could in law be acquired before 30 April 2006  the
      date on which the period  prescribed  for  transposing  the  Directive
      expired and since, at that date, the claimant had been in  prison  for
      more than five years, he had remained in  prison  for  a  further  two
      months thereafter and had been out of prison for less than nine months
      when the decision to deport him had been adopted, he had not  acquired
      a right of permanent residence under Article 16(1)  of  the  Directive
      when that decision  had  been  adopted.  In  those  circumstances  the
      Supreme Court stayed the proceedings and  referred  to  the  Court  of
      Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling three questions
      on the interpretation of Articles 16 and  28  of  the  Directive,  viz
      whether  enhanced  protection  under  Article  28(3)(a)  depended   on
      possessing a right of permanent residence under  Article  16  and,  if
      not, how the period of residence for the previous ten years was to  be
      calculated, and what the true relationship was  between  the  ten-year
      residence test and the overall assessment of an integrative link:  see
      [2017] 1 All ER 999.

  32. In the second case the claimant was a Greek national who had moved  to
      Germany as a child, where he had continuously resided for 25 years and
      had a right of permanent residence within the meaning of Article 16 of
      the Directive. The claimant was convicted  of  a  serious  offence  in
      Germany and was sentenced to over five years' imprisonment. Whilst  he
      was in custody, the  German  authorities  decided,  on  the  basis  of
      national law transposing Article 28(3)(a) of the Directive,  that  the
      claimant had lost his right of entry to and residence in  Germany  and
      he was therefore ordered  to  leave.  After  that  decision  had  been
      annulled by a German court, the authorities appealed to the  referring
      court, which, as a preliminary point, found that no imperative grounds
      of public security, within the meaning of Article 28(3)(a), could have
      arisen and that, therefore, if the claimant were entitled to  enhanced
      protection against expulsion under that provision, it  should  dismiss
      the appeal.  The court, accordingly, referred to the Court of  Justice
      of the European Union for a preliminary ruling four questions  on  the
      interpretation of Article 28(3)(a) of the Directive.

  33. The CJEU held, firstly, that the protection against expulsion provided
      for by Article 28 of the Free Movement Directive  gradually  increased
      in proportion to the  degree  of  integration  of  the  Union  citizen
      concerned in the host member state, and  that  it  followed  that  the
      enhanced protection provided for by Article 28(3)(a) was available  to
      a Union citizen only  in  so  far  as  he  satisfied  the  eligibility
      condition for the protection referred  to  in  Article  28(2),  namely
      having a  right  of  permanent  residence  under  Article  16  of  the
      Directive.   Unlike  a  Union  citizen  with  a  permanent  right   of
      residence, who could only be expelled  from  the  host  state  on  the
      grounds under Article 28(2), a citizen who had not acquired that right
      could be expelled if he became an unreasonable burden  on  the  social
      assistance system of the host state.  The Court said that such a Union
      citizen could not, at the same time,  enjoy  the  enhanced  protection
      under Article 28(3)(a), and that, accordingly, it was  a  prerequisite
      of eligibility for protection against expulsion  provided  by  Article
      28(3)(a) of the Directive that the person concerned  had  a  right  of
      permanent residence within the meaning of Articles 16 and 28(2) of the
      Directive.

  34. Secondly, and importantly for the purposes of the present appeal,  the
      Court held that the ten-year period of  residence  necessary  for  the
      grant of the enhanced protection provided by Article 28(3)(a)  of  the
      Directive had to be calculated by counting back from the date  of  the
      expulsion decision and had to be continuous.  The Court said that when
      looking at the extent to which absences from  the  host  member  state
      during the period referred to in Article 28(3)(a) prevented the person
      concerned from enjoying the enhanced protection, an overall assessment
      had to be made of the person's  situation  on  each  occasion  at  the
      precise time when the question of expulsion arose, and the  fact  that
      the person was placed in  custody  did  not  automatically  break  the
      integrative links which he had previously forged with that  state  and
      the continuity of his residence for the purpose  of  Article  28(3)(a)
      and,  therefore,  deprive  him  of  the  enhanced  protection  against
      expulsion. Accordingly, in the case of a Union citizen who was serving
      a custodial sentence and against whom an expulsion decision  had  been
      adopted, the condition of having resided in the host member state  for
      the previous ten years under Article 28(3)(a) could be satisfied where
      an overall assessment of the person's situation, taking  into  account
      all the relevant factors, led to the conclusion that,  notwithstanding
      that detention, the integrative links between the person concerned and
      the host state had not been broken. The Court said that those  factors
      included, inter alia, the strength of  the  integrative  links  forged
      with the host state before the detention, the nature of  the  sentence
      which had resulted in the detention, the circumstances in  which  that
      sentence had been committed and the conduct of the  person  throughout
      the period of detention.

  35. At [70]-[75] the CJEU said:

         "70      As to whether periods of imprisonment may,  by  themselves
         and irrespective of periods of absence from the host Member  State,
         also lead, where appropriate, to a severing of the link  with  that
         State and to the discontinuity of the period of residence  in  that
         State, the court has held that although, in principle, such periods
         of  imprisonment  interrupt  the  continuity  of  the   period   of
         residence,  for  the  purpose  of  Article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive
         2004/38, it is nevertheless necessary   -  in  order  to  determine
         whether those periods of imprisonment have broken  the  integrative
         links previously forged with the host Member State with the  result
         that the person concerned is no longer  entitled  to  the  enhanced
         protection provided for in that provision - to carry out an overall
         assessment of the situation of that person at the precise time when
         the question of expulsion arises. In the context  of  that  overall
         assessment,  periods   of   imprisonment   must   be   taken   into
         consideration together  with  all  the  relevant  factors  in  each
         individual case, including, as the case may  be,  the  circumstance
         that the person concerned resided in the host Member State for  the
         ten years preceding his imprisonment (see, to that effect, judgment
         of 16 January 2014, G., C-400/12,  EU:C:2014:9,  paragraphs  33  to
         38).

         71 Indeed, particularly in the case of  a  Union  citizen  who  was
         already in a position  to  satisfy  the  condition  of  ten  years'
         continuous residence in the host Member State  in  the  past,  even
         before he committed a criminal act that resulted in his  detention,
         the fact that the person concerned was placed  in  custody  by  the
         authorities of that  state  cannot  be  regarded  as  automatically
         breaking the integrative links  that  that  person  had  previously
         forged with that State and the continuity of his residence in  that
         State for the purpose of Article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 and,
         therefore,  depriving  him  of  the  enhanced  protection   against
         expulsion  provided  for  in  that  provision.  Moreover,  such  an
         interpretation  would  deprive  that  provision  of  much  of   its
         practical effect, since an expulsion measure  will  most  often  be
         adopted precisely because of the conduct of  the  person  concerned
         that led to his conviction and detention.

         72 As part of the overall assessment, mentioned in para  70  above,
         which, in this case, is for the referring court to carry out, it is
         necessary to take into account, as regards  the  integrative  links
         forged by B with  the  host  Member  State  during  the  period  of
         residence before his detention,  the  fact  that,  the  more  those
         integrative links with that State are  solid  -  including  from  a
         social, cultural and family perspective, to the  point  where,  for
         example, the person concerned is genuinely rooted in the society of
         that State, as found by the referring court in the main proceedings
         - the lower the probability that a period of detention  could  have
         resulted  in  those  links  being  broken  and,   consequently,   a
         discontinuity of the ten-year period of residence  referred  to  in
         Article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38.

         73 Other relevant factors in that overall assessment  may  include,
         as observed by Advocate  General  in  points  123  to  125  of  his
         Opinion, first, the nature of the  offence  that  resulted  in  the
         period of imprisonment in question and the circumstances  in  which
         that offence was committed, and, secondly, all the relevant factors
         as regards the behaviour of the person concerned during the  period
         of imprisonment.

         74 While the nature of the offence and the circumstances  in  which
         it was committed shed light on  the  extent  to  which  the  person
         concerned has, as the case may be,  become  disconnected  from  the
         society of the host  Member  State,  the  attitude  of  the  person
         concerned  during  his  detention  may,  in  turn,  reinforce  that
         disconnection or, conversely, help to  maintain  or  restore  links
         previously forged with the host Member State with  a  view  to  his
         future social reintegration in that State.

         75 On that last point, it should also be borne in mind that, as the
         Court has already pointed out, the  social  rehabilitation  of  the
         Union citizen in  the  State  in  which  he  has  become  genuinely
         integrated is not only in his interest but  also  in  that  of  the
         European  Union  in  general  (judgment  of   23   November   2010,
         Tsakouridis, C-145/09, EU:C:2010:708, paragraph 50)."

  36. The parties were agreed that these  paragraphs  set  out  the  correct
      approach to the issue before the FtT, and they were also  agreed  that
      the FtT directed itself correctly that they set out  the  test  to  be
      applied. The question on the appeal  before  us  is  whether  the  FtT
      committed any material error of law in how it applied this approach to
      the facts of the case before it.

Discussion

  37. We have carefully considered the judgment of the  FtT  and  detect  no
      error of law in it.   As we have said, the FtT approached  the  issues
      on the correct legal basis. The conclusions which the FtT reached were
      open to it on the evidence that it considered,  and  its  judgment  is
      clearly reasoned and deals with all of the relevant matters.

  38. The first issue is whether the FtT was correct in its conclusion  that
      the Respondent qualified for the highest level of protection by reason
      of having lived in the UK continuously for 10 years from the  date  of
      the decision notwithstanding her imprisonment.  In our view,  the  FtT
      was entitled  to  conclude  that,  notwithstanding  the  very  serious
      offence which the Respondent committed, and the sentence of six  years
      imprisonment which was imposed (three of which she served in  prison),
      that sentence did not result in her  integrative  links  with  the  UK
      being broken and, consequently, a discontinuity of the ten-year period
      of residence referred to in reg 27(4)(a), and that the FtT's  decision
      on this issue was  correct.    We  reject  the  Secretary  of  State's
      argument that the FtT erred on this question.

  39. The starting point is that, as we have said, the  Respondent  came  to
      the UK in June 1997 and had lived in the UK for over 20 years prior to
      the Secretary of State's decision to deport her in December 2017.  She
      acquired the right of permanent residence no  later  than  2007,  some
      nine years before she was sent to prison.   The  evidence  before  the
      FtT demonstrated that for  many  years  before  her  imprisonment  the
      Respondent had a settled family life in the UK with  her  husband  and
      two children, who were born in 2006 and 2009.  Both children were born
      in the UK.  There was a quantity of evidence before the  Secretary  of
      State and before the FtT including  tax  returns,  financial  records,
      family documents and photographs describing family life,  as  the  FtT
      said, between 2002 and the time the deportation  decision  was  taken.
      There  was  also  evidence  of  the  business  interest  here  of  the
      Respondent and her husband, which provides them  with  an  income  and
      with employment. On the whole of the evidence before the FtT,  it  was
      fully entitled to reach its finding that, prior to her  commission  of
      the offence of which she  was  later  convicted,  the  Respondent  was
      'genuinely rooted in the United Kingdom with her family and children'.



  40. Given that finding, the question that the FtT then had to consider was
      whether the Respondent's imprisonment broke her integrative  links  to
      the United Kingdom. The fact of the Respondent's settled  family  life
      in the UK at the time she went to prison was a factor to which the FtT
      was entitled to give great weight in determining  whether  prison  had
      broken her integrative links with the UK.   It  demonstrated,  in  the
      language used by the CJEU in FV, supra, that she was 'rooted'  in  the
      UK.  The FtT found that she planned to return  home  (subject  to  the
      approval of the Probation Service) once she was released.   There  was
      evidence before the FtT that in the  event  that  the  Respondent  was
      deported her husband would not permit  the  children  to  go  back  to
      Bulgaria with her.   The FtT considered the effect which  imprisonment
      had  had  on  the  Respondent's  family  life  and  whether   it   had
      strengthened or weakened the bonds  between  the  Respondent  and  her
      children, and between the Respondent and her husband.     At [65]  the
      FtT found that the links between the Respondent and her  children  had
      strengthened notwithstanding her imprisonment:

         "65.     Nothing since her sentence  in  imprisonment  has  changed
         that matrix. If anything her bond  with  the  United  Kingdom  have
         depend and in that of her relationship with  her  progression  with
         her children not withstanding her incarceration. They have  visited
         lengthily and  discussed  with  her  husband  about  her  offending
         behaviour and they have almost certainly  become  stronger  in  the
         sense that they have endured the suffering that  their  mother  had
         inflicted upon them in forced separation. Despite that the children
         remain loyal and committed to her and  her  to  them.  Her  husband
         despite their difficulties of their relationship before the offence
         occurred has remained loyal to her and was in court today  to  show
         and continue that level of support." (sic)

  41. The Secretary of State criticised this reasoning as improbable but  we
      were of the view that the Secretary of State's criticism  amounted  to
      no more than a disagreement with the FtT's  reasoning.  It  is  highly
      likely that  the  enforced  separation  of  the  Respondent  from  her
      children caused them to miss her and so strengthen their love for her.
        It is also entirely possible that her love for them deepened because
      of her time away from them  in  prison.   In  any  event,  these  were
      findings of fact by the FtT that were  open  to  it  on  the  evidence
      before it and they cannot be characterised as irrational.   As for the
      relationship  between  the  Respondent  and  her  husband,   the   FtT
      acknowledged  that  they  had  separated  as  a  consequence  of   her
      imprisonment but found as a fact at [57] that they wished  to  restart
      their relationship once she is released.

  42. In summary, there was ample material before the  FtT  to  support  its
      finding  that  the  Respondent's  imprisonment  had   not   caused   a
      discontinuity in her residence in the UK which had otherwise subsisted
      for more than 10 years.  It was therefore not wrong in law to conclude
      that she was only liable to be  deported  on  'imperative  grounds  of
      public security' (reg 27(4)(a)).

  43. We turn to the second issue before us, namely whether the FtT erred in
      its  conclusion  that  there  no  such  grounds  in  respect  of   the
      Respondent.

  44. We begin by iterating that we recognise the serious  of  the  offences
      which the Respondent committed and which resulted in serious injury to
      T.   Nothing in our decision should be taken as minimising in any  way
      the suffering which she endured as a consequence.   The  question  for
      us is whether the FtT was wrong as a matter of law  to  conclude  that
      the Respondent's offences, and the other factors relied  upon  by  the
      Secretary of State, did not amount to  imperative  grounds  of  public
      security so as to justify her removal to Bulgaria.   For the following
      reasons we do not consider that FtT was wrong to conclude as it did.

  45. First, the FtT correctly recognised that the  concept  of  'imperative
      grounds of public security' imposes a very high standard.  It requires
      proof not only of the existence of a threat to  public  security,  but
      also that the threat is of a particularly high degree of  seriousness:
      Land Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg v Tsakouridis, supra, [41].

  46. In I v Oberbï¿½rgermeisterin der Stadt Remscheid [2012] QB 799, the CJEU
      considered the meaning of the expression 'imperative grounds of public
      security'.  The claimant had been convicted of  multiple  offences  of
      sexual abuse, sexual coercion  and  rape  of  a  14-year-old  girl  in
      respect of which he had been sentenced to 7ï¿½ years' imprisonment.  The
      CJEU was asked to decide whether the expression 'imperative grounds of
      public  security'  referred  only  to  conduct  which  threatened  the
      security of the state itself, its population and the survival  of  its
      institutions, or was broader in scope. The decision was considered  by
      the Court of Appeal in Straszewski v Secretary of State for  the  Home
      Department, supra:

         "22      Our attention was not drawn to any case in which the  CJEU
         has  considered  the  kind  of  conduct  that  is  likely   to   be
         sufficiently serious to justify deportation of an EEA national  who
         enjoys a permanent right of residence but  has  not  lived  in  the
         member state concerned for a period of at least ten years. Ms  Chan
         did,  however,  draw  our  attention  to  the  decision  in I   v
         Oberbï¿½rgermeisterin der Stadt Remscheid [2012] QB 799, in which the
         claimant had been convicted of multiple offences of  sexual  abuse,
         sexual coercion and rape of a 14-year-old girl in respect of  which
         he had been sentenced to 7ï¿½ years' imprisonment. The CJEU was asked
         to decide whether the  expression  "imperative  grounds  of  public
         security" referred only to conduct which threatened the security of
         the  state  itself,  its  population  and  the  survival   of   its
         institutions or was broader in scope.

         23 In giving its judgment the court, at pp  814-816,  paras  17-30,
         emphasised that member states retain the freedom to  determine  the
         requirements of public policy and  public  security  in  accordance
         with their  national  needs,  but  that  the  requirements  of  the
         Directive must still be  interpreted  strictly.  Criminal  offences
         which constitute a  particularly  serious  threat  to  one  of  the
         fundamental interests of society or which pose a direct  threat  to
         the calm and physical security of the population  may  fall  within
         the concept of "imperative grounds of public security", as long  as
         the  manner  in  which  such  offences  were  committed   discloses
         particularly  serious  characteristics.  However,  the  court  also
         emphasised that even then deportation will not be justified  unless
         the conduct of the person concerned represents a  genuine,  present
         threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society, which
         normally implies that he has a propensity to act in the same way in
         the future.

         24 I do not find that case to be of great assistance in determining
         whether in any individual  case  there  are  "serious"  grounds  of
         public policy or public security sufficient to justify deportation.
         It  is  clear,  as  the  court  confirmed,  that   the   expression
         "imperative grounds of  public  security"  creates  a  considerably
         stricter  test  than  merely  "serious"  grounds,  but  since   the
         application  of  the  test  is  primarily  for  the  member   state
         concerned, which must take into account social conditions  as  well
         as the various factors to which the Directive  itself  refers,  the
         question is likely to turn to a  large  extent  on  the  particular
         facts of the case. It would therefore be unwise,  in  my  view,  to
         attempt to lay down guidelines. In the end, the Secretary of  State
         must give effect to  the  Regulations,  which  themselves  must  be
         interpreted against the background of the right  of  free  movement
         and the need to ensure  that  derogations  from  it  are  construed
         strictly. In that context it is worth noting that even  in  a  case
         where it is considered that removal is  prima  facie  justified  on
         imperative grounds of  public  security,  the  decision-maker  must
         consider, among other things, whether the offender has a propensity
         to re-offend in a similar way (judgment, paragraph 30).

         25 In the present case the Secretary of State sought to justify  Mr
         Straszewski's deportation on serious grounds of  public  policy  or
         public security. "Public policy" for these  purposes  includes  the
         policy  which  is  reflected  in  the  interest  of  the  state  in
         protecting its citizens from violent crime and the theft  of  their
         property. These are fundamental interests of society and therefore,
         although regulation 21(3) does not speak in terms of  the  risk  of
         causing harm by future offending, in a case of this  kind  that  is
         the risk which the Secretary of State is called upon to assess when
         considering deportation. That requires an evaluation to be made  of
         the likelihood that the person concerned will offend again and what
         the consequences are likely to be if he does. In addition, the need
         for  the  conduct  of  the  person   concerned   to   represent   a
         "sufficiently serious" threat to one of the  fundamental  interests
         of society requires the  decision-maker  to  balance  the risk  of
         future harm against the need to give effect to the  right  of  free
         movement. In any given case an evaluative exercise of that kind may
         admit of more than one answer. If so, provided that all appropriate
         factors have been  taken  into  account,  the  decision  cannot  be
         impugned unless it is perverse  or  irrational,  in  the  sense  of
         falling outside the range of permissible decisions."

47. In determining that the Respondent did not present a genuinely  present
    and sufficient threat affecting one of  the  fundamental  interests  of
    society, so as to justify her removal on imperative grounds  of  public
    security the FtT took into account  the  following  matters  (at  [67]-
    [71]); the 'overwhelming' evidence about the Respondent's  achievements
    in custody, that she had completed many courses, and that there were no
    disciplinary findings against her; she had expressed  remorse  for  the
    victim, T; she planned  to  return  to  the  family  home  (subject  to
    approval by the NPS) on her release;  and  the  evidence  of  a  social
    worker, [LB], who said that the Respondent had made  real  progress  in
    custody and posed a low risk of re-offending.  The  FtT  said  that  it
    accepted Ms [B]'s evidence in full,  she  having  given  live  evidence
    before it.

48. In light of these findings, which were open to the FtT, we  are  unable
    to regard its conclusion  overall  as  being  erroneous  in  law.   The
    Secretary of State's  grounds  of  appeal  seek  to  impugn  the  FtT's
    reasoning in various ways, for example, by suggesting that it  had  not
    had sufficient regard for the seriousness of the  consequences  of  re-
    offending.  That criticism misses the  point  that  the  FtT  expressly
    found, on the basis of the evidence it considered that the risk of  re-
    offending was low.    The case law we have discussed shows that the key
    question is whether the Respondent has a propensity to  re-offend,  and
    there was nothing before the FtT which  could  have  compelled  such  a
    conclusion.  All of the material pointed the other way.

49. The Secretary of State's grounds of  appeal  refer  repeatedly  to  the
    seriousness of the offence as justifying deportation by itself.   Given
    that it was not suggested in the grounds that the  seriousness  of  the
    offence was such as to invoke the principle in R Bouchereau [1978] 1 QB
    732 and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Marchon
    [1993] 2 CMLR 132, the seriousness of the Respondent's offence was just
    one of the factors to be considered as we have explained.  But the  FtT
    expressly recognised the seriousness of  the  Respondent's  offence  at
    [64] and quoted the sentencing judge at [29] and thus did not  overlook
    it.    We agree with the FtT that, serious though the offence  was,  it
    did not fall into a category of criminality of the  utmost  seriousness
    so that an inference could be more readily drawn  that  the  Respondent
    prima  facie  poses  a  sufficiently  serious  threat  to  one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.

50. The Secretary of State also criticised the FtT's treatment of the issue
    of rehabilitation and in particular the finding at [75] et seq that the
    Respondent was more likely to  be  rehabilitated  in  the  UK  than  in
    Bulgaria.  The FtT referred to the case of Essa, supra, in this regard.
    In that case the Upper Tribunal said at [34]-[35]:

         "34.     If the very factors that  contribute  to  his  integration
         that assist in rehabilitation of such offenders  (family  ties  and
         responsibilities, accommodation, education,  training,  employment,
         active membership of a community and the like) will assist  in  the
         completion of a process of  rehabilitation,  then  that  can  be  a
         substantial  factor  in  the  balance.  If  the   claimant   cannot
         constitute a  present  threat  when  rehabilitated,  and  is  well-
         advanced in rehabilitation  in  a  host  state  where  there  is  a
         substantial degree of integration, it may well very well  [sic]  be
         disproportionate to proceed to deportation.

         35.      At the other end of the scale, if there are no  reasonable
         prospects of rehabilitation, the claimant is a present  threat  and
         is likely to remain so for the indefinite future, we cannot see how
         the prospects of  rehabilitation  could  constitute  a  significant
         factor in the balance. Thus recidivist offenders, career criminals,
         adult  offenders  who  have  failed  to   engage   with   treatment
         programmes, claimants with impulses to  commit  sexual  or  violent
         offences and the like may well fall into this category."

51. In MC (Essa principles recast) Portugal [2015] UKUT 520 (IAC) the Upper
    Tribunal summarised the relevant principles as follows at [29]:

      a. Essa rehabilitation principles are specific to decisions taken  on
         public policy, public security and public health grounds under  reg
         21 of the 2006 Regulations

      b. It is only if the personal conduct of the person concerned is found
         to represent a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
         affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society  (regulation
         21(5)(c)) that it becomes relevant to consider whether the decision
         is  proportionate  taking  into  account  all  the   considerations
         identified in regulation 21(5)-(6).

      c. There is no specific  reference  in  the  expulsion  provisions  of
         either the Free Movement  Directive  or  the  2006  Regulations  to
         rehabilitation, but it has been seen by the Court of Justice as  an
         aspect of integration, which is one of the factors referred  to  in
         Article 28(1) and reg 21(6) (Essa at [23]).

      d. Rehabilitation is not  an  issue  to  be  addressed  in  every  EEA
         deportation or removal decision taken under regulation 21; it  will
         not be relevant, for example, if rehabilitation  has  already  been
         completed (Essa at [32]-[33]).

      e.      Reference      to      prospects       of       rehabilitation
         concerns reasonable prospects of a person ceasing to commit crime
         (Essa at [35]), not the mere possibility of rehabilitation.  Where
         relevant (see (d) above) such prospects are a factor  to  be  taken
         into account in the  proportionality  assessment  required  by  reg
         21(5) and (6) ((Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  v
         Dumliauskas [2015] EWCA Civ 145, [41]). Such prospects are  to  be
         taken  into  account  even  if   not   raised   by   the   offender
         (Dumliauskas at [52]). Gauging such prospects  requires  assessing
         the relative prospects of rehabilitation in the host  Member  State
         as compared with those in the Member State of origin, but,  in  the
         absence of evidence, it is not to be  assumed  that  prospects  are
         materially different in that other  Member  State  (Dumliauskas at
         [46], [52]-[53] and [59]).

      f. Matters that are relevant  when  examining  the  prospects  of  the
         rehabilitation   of   offenders    include    family    ties    and
         responsibilities, accommodation, education,  training,  employment,
         active membership of a community  and  the  like  (Essa (2013)  at
         [34]). However, lack of access to a Probation Officer or equivalent
         in  the  other  Member  State  should  not,  in  general,  preclude
         deportation (Dumliauskas at [55]).

      g. In the absence of integration and a right of  permanent  residence,
         the future prospects of integration  cannot  be  a  weighty  factor
         (Dumliauskas at [44] and [54]).  Even  when  such  prospects  have
         significant weight they are not a trump card, as what the Directive
         and  the  2006  Regulations  require  is  a  wide-ranging  holistic
         assessment. Both recognise that  the  more  serious  the  risk  of
         reoffending, and the offences that a person may commit, the greater
         the right to interfere with the right of residence (Dumliauskas at
         [46] and [54]).

  52. In light of these principles it seems to us that it was  not  actually
      necessary for the FtT to consider rehabilitation because it found that
      the Respondent does not  pose  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
      serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society.
      But we see no  error  in  the  FtT's  approach.   It  found  that  her
      prospects of rehabilitation would be improved by  her  remaining  with
      her family and  children  and  being  supervised  on  licence  by  the
      Probation Service.  Given the evidence that her children would not  be
      permitted by their father to return with her to Bulgaria, and that she
      had no links with Bulgaria, this was a finding by the FtT  based  upon
      the evidence and it was a finding which was properly open to it.

      Conclusion

  53. Accordingly, we have concluded that the FtT did not err in  law.  This
      appeal is dismissed.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of  any
error of law.

Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeal  of
Mrs. Natacha [N] against the respondent's decision stands.
