Representation:
For the Appellant:           Mr Salam, Salam & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Zambia born on the 7th March 1981. She
       appeals with permission  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       (Judge A. Simmonds) to dismiss her appeal on human rights grounds.

    2. On the 13th  August  2015  the  Appellant  made  an  application  for
       Indefinite Leave to Remain on the grounds  that  she  had  spent  ten
       years lawfully in the United Kingdom. The application was refused  by
       the Respondent on the 10th  November  2015  and  the  Appellant  duly
       appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

    3. The matter in issue before the First-tier Tribunal was whether  there
       had been gaps in the Appellant's lawful residence such that  she  was
       unable to qualify under the operative paragraph  of  the  Immigration
       Rules, 276B. The accepted chronology, with the periods of overstaying
       highlighted in italics,  is as follows:


       1.9.05     Appellant entered the UK with leave to enter as a student
       29.8.05    She submitted an in-time application to extend that  leave
                  -granted
       30.11.07   Appellant's leave expired


       4.12.07    Appellant makes an out-of-time application for leave
       21.12.07   Application rejected
       3.1.08     Appellant makes an out-of-time application for leave
            [Total period overstaying: 58 days]


       28.1.08    Leave granted
       27.9.08    Appellant makes an in-time application for further leave
       31.10.08   Further leave granted
       31.10.09   Appellant's leave expired


       4.11.09    Appellant makes an out-of-time application for leave
       11.1.10    Refused with a right of appeal
       27.1.10    Appellant makes an out-of-time application for leave
            [Total period overstaying: 135 days]


       16.3.10    Leave granted
       14.2.11    Appellant makes an in-time application for further  leave-
                  granted
       1.3.13     Appellant makes an in-time application for further leave
       3.4.15     Leave expired (following curtailment)


       25.4.15    Appellant makes an out-of-time application for leave


       6.9.16     Leave granted
       13.8.15    Appellant makes an in-time application for further leave

    4. In its consideration of this chronology the First-tier  Tribunal  was
       satisfied that the periods of overstaying were such  that  the  rule,
       which requires continuous lawful residence, could not  be  satisfied.
       Submissions made by the Appellant's representative  to  the  contrary
       were rejected and the appeal was dismissed.

    5. Permission was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Mandalia on the
       7th August 2017, who  considered  it  arguable  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal applied the wrong version of  the  rule.  The  crux  of  the
       Appellant's case is that the version of the  'long  residence'  rule,
       paragraph  276B,  that  applied  at  the  time  that  she  made   her
       application - and by virtue of transitional provisions  continued  to
       apply in her case - was materially different from the  later  version
       that was applied by the First-tier Tribunal.

       Discussion and Findings

    6. At paragraph 10 of the determination the First-tier Tribunal set  out
       paragraph 276B of HC1994, this being the version of the rule in force
       at the date of the appeal on the 30th November 2016.  It was accepted
       that the Appellant met all of the requirements save those set out  at
       sub-paragraph (i) read with (iii) and (v):

           276B. The requirements to be met by an applicant for  indefinite
           leave to remain on the ground of long residence  in  the  United
           Kingdom are that:

           (i)   (a)   he has had  at  least  10  years  continuous  lawful
           residence in the United Kingdom.

           ...

           (iii) the applicant does not fall for refusal under the  general
           grounds for refusal.

           ...

           (v)   the  applicant  must  not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
           immigration laws, except that,  where  paragraph  39E  of  these
           Rules  applies,  any  current  period  of  overstaying  will  be
           disregarded. Any previous period of overstaying between  periods
           of leave will also be disregarded where -

              (a)      the previous application was made before 24 November
              2016 and within 28 days of the expiry of leave; or

              (b)      the further application was  made  on  or  after  24
              November 2016 and paragraph 39E of these Rules applied.

    7. Applying that rule, which had been amended as of  the  24th  November
       2016, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the  Appellant  could  meet
       the requirements of 276B(i)(a) because  her  periods  of  overstaying
       were not such that they could be disregarded.  Consideration is given
       to whether the factors in paragraph 39E come  into  play  and  it  is
       concluded that they do not (for the purpose of this decision  I  need
       not elaborate on this point). The Tribunal noted the representative's
       submission that the 'clock stopped' every  time  that  the  Appellant
       made an application, but declined to take that approach since it  had
       not been referred to any legal authority on the point.

    8. On appeal the point made by Mr Salam, considered  arguable  by  Judge
       Mandalia and agreed as correct by Mr  Harrison,  is  that  the  legal
       authority that the Tribunal was looking for derived from the  wording
       of the rule as it stood at the  date  that  the  Appellant  made  her
       application, and at the date of decision. The  version  of  the  rule
       contained in HC1039 read, where relevant, as follows:

           (v)   the  applicant  must  not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
           immigration laws except that any period  of  overstaying  for  a
           period of 28 days or less  will  be  disregarded,  as  will  any
           period of overstaying between periods of entry clearance,  leave
           to enter or leave to remain of up to 28 days and any  period  of
           overstaying pending the determination  of  an  application  made
           within that 28 day period.

    9. If this was the rule that had been  applied,  the  three  periods  of
       overstaying  highlighted  above  in  italics  would  all  have   been
       disregarded; on each occasion  the  Appellant  made  her  application
       within 28 days and the remaining periods of overstaying were "pending
       determination of an application".  Before me it was agreed that  this
       version was  the  operative  rule,  by  virtue  of  the  transitional
       provisions set out in HC667. Following a  schedule  of  sections  and
       commencement  dates,  none  of  which  apply  here,  that   statutory
       instrument reads:

           The other changes set out in this statement  shall  take  effect
           from 24 November 2016. However, in relation to those changes, if
           an application has been made for entry  clearance  or  leave  to
           enter or remain or  administrative  review  before  24  November
           2016, the application will be decided  in  accordance  with  the
           Immigration Rules in force on 23 November 2016.

   10. The parties are  now  in  agreement  that  under  the  terms  of  the
       Immigration Rules in force on the 23rd November  2016  the  Appellant
       would succeed: see above. Since her application was made  before  the
       24th November 2016 the transitional provisions in HC667 applied,  the
       old version of the rule was the operative one, and her appeal  should
       have been allowed.

   11. I therefore substitute  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
       setting  it  aside  for  legal  misdirection  and  finding  that  the
       Appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  the  operative  version   of
       paragraph 276B. Since the Respondent accepts  this  to  be  a  'human
       rights decision' it follows that the appeal must be allowed.

       Decisions

   12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error  of
       law and it is set aside.

   13. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal on human rights grounds.

   14. There is no order for anonymity.

                                                          24th November 2017
