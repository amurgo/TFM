                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity order

The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  Court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly. This order applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure
to comply with this order could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

Decision and reasons

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the Upper Tribunal that there was no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  allow  the  claimant's  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision to deport him from the United
    Kingdom to Somalia, of which he is a citizen.

 2. At the beginning of the hearing, Mr Eaton confirmed that the claimant's
    challenge to the Secretary of State's decision  was  limited  to  human
    rights grounds and that he did not seek to rely on Article 3 ECHR.  HIs
    appeal under the Refugee Convention and in humanitarian protection  had
    been dismissed in the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  claimant  had  not
    sought to challenge that dismissal.

 3. The Tribunal was seised only of arguments under Article 8 ECHR in these
    proceedings.

Vulnerable witness assessment

 4. The claimant gave evidence at the Upper Tribunal hearing.   I have  had
    regard to the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in M  (Afghanistan)
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1123 and I
    remind myself that failure  to  apply  the  Senior  President's  Child,
    Vulnerable Adult and Sensitive Witnesses Guidance of  30  October  2008
    and the joint Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of 2010 when dealing with
    a vulnerable witness is an error of law.

 5. It is not in dispute that this claimant, who has mental health  issues,
    should be  treated  as  a  vulnerable  adult.   Having  regard  to  the
    direction of the Court of Appeal that the claimant's  position  be  re-
    examined afresh, I was satisfied that it was  necessary  to  hear  oral
    evidence from him to enable the fair hearing of the case.

 6. I explored with Mr  Eaton  whether  the  claimant's  welfare  would  be
    prejudiced by his giving evidence, and/or  what  adjustments  would  be
    required to enable him to  give  evidence.   Mr  Eaton  said  that  the
    claimant was ready to give evidence and that it was not considered that
    his welfare would be affected.  Dr Rachel Dodd, the claimant's  general
    medical  practitioner,  had  stated  in  her   written   evidence   her
    professional opinion that the claimant would need  regular  breaks  and
    extra care when explaining complex matters.

 7. It was agreed that the claimant would be asked clear  simple  questions
    and given breaks when requested. The claimant said that  he  had  taken
    his medication and was not experiencing any  intrusive  thoughts.   His
    evidence proceeded without difficulty and no submissions or  objections
    were raised, by the claimant or on his  behalf,  about  the  manner  in
    which his evidence was taken.



Background

 8. The claimant's stated date of birth is 4 March 1982.  He  came  to  the
    United Kingdom from Somalia to join his mother in February 1993, as one
    of 7 siblings admitted on a family  reunion  visa.   His  father  later
    rejoined the family in June 1995.  On 19 January 2000, the whole family
    were granted indefinite leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    applicant's mother and father and 4 of his siblings  were  subsequently
    naturalised as British citizens in 2003/2004.  The applicant's case  is
    that all his family and close relatives are now in the United Kingdom.

 9. On 25 July 2007, the claimant was convicted of one count of rape  of  a
    female age 16 years or over and  one  count  of  attempted  rape.   The
    evidence was that the claimant attacked a woman while she was sleeping,
    raping her in two different ways while holding a knife  to  her  throat
    and threatening to kill her.  The woman was vulnerable and pregnant  at
    the time of  the  rape.  The  claimant  pleaded  not  guilty,  but  was
    convicted, and sentenced to a period of 10 years' imprisonment. He  did
    not  appeal  either  the  sentence  or  the  conviction,  but  did  not
    acknowledge responsibility for his actions until 2011, when he made his
    asylum claim.

10. The applicant claimed asylum on 27 July 2011, on the basis that he  was
    at risk on return, from the family of his victim, a Somali woman,  from
    the civil war generally, and as a Westernised person he was at risk  of
    kidnapping. The  claimant  declared  no  medical  conditions  when  his
    application for asylum was considered, except that he had a disability,
    dyslexia.  He considered that in Somalia, he would be forced to  resume
    the practice of Islam, which he had not done since coming to the United
    Kingdom, and that, because he had body tattoos (he has 'Allah' tattooed
    on his body in two places), he would be at risk of physical violence as
    tattoos are haram (forbidden) under Islamic law.

11. On 6 December 2011, the  claimant  was  released  on  licence,  and  on
    immigration bail, to the address of his paternal uncle in  London.   He
    was fitted with an electronic tag and lived with his uncle and his aunt
    by marriage at that address until the tag was removed in 2013.

12. On 31 July 2012, while still on licence and living at his uncle's home,
    the applicant  was  convicted  of  possession  of  a  small  amount  of
    cannabis, then a Class B controlled drug, and fined �600.

13. On 25 December 2012, the claimant's brother jumped to  his  death  from
    the 9th floor of the next building to that in which he was living.  The
    claimant was with him; he tried to catch his brother, but was unable to
    stop him falling.  The claimant  felt  responsible  for  his  brother's
    death.  The claimant was hospitalised for a few days and began  hearing
    voices, mainly his brother talking to him and telling him to  join  him
    in death, or making various demands of him.  After his brother's death,
    the claimant attempted to jump from the same site on  three  occasions.
    There followed a period of mental ill health.

14. The claimant's asylum claim was rejected, and his appeal  dismissed  by
    the First-tier  Tribunal  in  its  May  2013  decision.   There  is  no
    challenge to that dismissal, or to the dismissal  of  his  humanitarian
    protection or Article 3 ECHR claims.

15. In 2013, after the First-tier Tribunal hearing, and when his electronic
    tagging ended, the claimant left his uncle's home and went to live with
    a maternal aunt in London, who lived in the  building  from  which  his
    brother had jumped to his death.  That building was next  door  to  his
    uncle's home.

16. In late 2014, the claimant went to the 9th floor, to the  balcony  from
    which his brother had jumped, and telephoned his aunt.   She  came  and
    persuaded him not to  jump.   The  claimant  then  spent  2  months  in
    hospital, dealing with his mental health issues.

17. In August 2015, the claimant was diagnosed in  London  with  follicular
    lymphoma while in detention.  Arrangements were made for treatment  and
    he was released to what is described as 'section  4  accommodation'  in
    Bristol.  The Bristol accommodation was provided under section 4 of the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which permits NASS  to  provide  'hard
    case support' outside  London,  where  a  claim  for  asylum  has  been
    determined and the individual is no longer an asylum seeker within  the
    meaning of Part VI of the Act.  Section 4 support claimants  must  also
    show that they have had interim support from NASS or a local  authority
    under Schedule 9 of the Act, and that they are destitute  and  have  no
    other avenues of support available.

18. In addition, NASS criteria require claimants to demonstrate  that  they
    are unable to leave the United Kingdom due to a physical impediment  to
    travel such as illness or late pregnancy; or because there is  no  safe
    route for return; or they are complying with an  attempt  to  obtain  a
    travel document; there are exceptional or compassionate  circumstances;
    or they have applied for judicial review.  In this case,  the  claimant
    had recently been diagnosed with cancer and required chemotherapy.

19.  The  claimant  had  chemotherapy  treatment  in  Bristol   under   the
    supervision  of  Dr  Lisa  Lowry,  a  consultant  haematologist.    His
    treatment ended in 2016 and he is  in  full  remission.   The  claimant
    still lives in Bristol, where he has a second cousin who supported  him
    emotionally, and with food, during his chemotherapy, and with  whom  he
    eats out, once or twice a week, now that  he  is  well.   The  claimant
    attends several Somali caf�s in Bristol, to watch football and interact
    with other asylum seekers there.   His mental health has improved,  but
    he fears that his physical or mental health  might  deteriorate  if  he
    were returned to Somaliland.

Procedural history

20. In her decision letter on  8  January  2013,  the  Secretary  of  State
    considered that section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 (as amended) was applicable and the applicant  was  a  foreign
    criminal convicted of a serious crime who would constituted a danger to
    the community.  Her decision was certified under  section  72(9)(b)  of
    the 2002 Act, on the basis that the automatic deportation provisions of
    the UK Borders Act 2007 applied, and the certificate must be considered
    first by the First-tier Tribunal.   The  Secretary  of  State  did  not
    consider that returning the claimant  to  Somaliland  would  unlawfully
    breach his private and family life rights under  Article  8  ECHR,  nor
    that there were any exceptional circumstances for which leave to remain
    should be given outside the Rules.

21. The applicant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  He did  so  out  of
    time, but because of his  health  problems  early  in  2013,  time  was
    extended to allow the appeal to proceed. In  its  decision  on  31  May
    2013, the First-tier Tribunal noted that  the  claimant  had  spent  20
    years in the United Kingdom. The evidence of the witnesses was  treated
    as fully credible by the Tribunal.  The Tribunal accepted that both  of
    the claimant's parents and three of  his  five  siblings  were  British
    citizens; that the claimant was an integral and  well-loved  member  of
    his close and extended family and  friendship  network;  and  that  his
    deportation would have a negative impact on the lives of  other  family
    members, particularly in  view  of  the  tragic  recent  death  of  the
    claimant's brother.

22. The First-tier Tribunal found that the claimant  had  very  little,  if
    any,   social,  cultural,  or  family  ties,  either  to   Somalia   or
    Somaliland; that he had only a few words of the  Somali  language,  not
    enough to hold a conversation or make himself understood; that he  knew
    very little of the Somali clan system or his place in it; and  that  he
    was not a practising Muslim, knew very little about his  religion,  and
    had 'Allah' tattooed in Arabic  on  his  arm  and  chest,  which  would
    attract adverse attention in an Islamic country as tattoos are haram in
    Islamic law.

23. The First-tier Tribunal considered  the  fact  that  the  claimant  had
    committed only one, albeit very serious offence  in  the  20  years  he
    spent in the United Kingdom.

24. The Tribunal noted that the claimant had  not  pleaded  guilty  at  the
    trial or during his sentence and had  not  shown  remorse  for  several
    years after his conviction.  The First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  the
    claimant had been reluctant to disclose his guilt externally because of
    the sensibilities of his community but had done so when he was detained
    and at risk of deportation.  Since his release in  2012,  the  claimant
    had accepted his guilt and had been focusing on victim empathy work.

25. Little weight was given by the First-tier Tribunal to the fact that the
    claimant had been fined  for  an  offence  of  possession  of  cannabis
    committed while he was on release on licence:  he had since completed a
    drug awareness course and had tested negative for any further use.  The
    First-tier Tribunal also did not attach much weight  to  a  very  small
    number of minor infringements of prison rules while he was in custody.
    The Tribunal considered the qualifications the claimant had obtained in
    prison and found that he would  be  in  a  better  position  to  obtain
    skilled employment in the future.

26. The First-tier Tribunal noted that the  claimant  was  living  with  an
    uncle and family and no longer mixing with the  friends  with  whom  he
    associated before going to prison. He spent much of the time  that  the
    curfew allowed, caring for his maternal great aunt  who  suffered  from
    numerous ailments, had frequent falls and very impaired  mobility.  The
    Tribunal  recognised  that  it  must  take  a  considerable  amount  of
    dedication to care for his great aunt on a daily basis. The  claimant's
    probation officer assessed him as posing a medium risk of harm  with  a
    low to medium risk of reoffending.

27. A psychiatric report noted that he had  expressed  regret  and  remorse
    about the offence and the psychiatrist considered that the claimant now
    presented a low risk of committing further serious  violent  or  sexual
    offences. He had not breached the terms of his immigration  bail  which
    included an electronic tag and curfew requirement.

28. The First-tier Tribunal gave weight to the evidence of Dr Markus Hoehne
    of the Max  Planck  Institute  for  Social  Anthropology,  that  Somali
    teenagers and young people who had been sent back  to  Somaliland  from
    abroad were pejoratively referred  to  as  'dhaqan  celis'  (return  to
    culture), mocked and very severely harassed for western and  non-Somali
    behaviour.  If the claimant did not live up to Islamic norms and rules,
    which predominated in Somalia, a risk of physical attack could  not  be
    excluded.

29. The First-tier Tribunal considered the medical evidence of  Dr  Harriet
    Hunt-Grubbe,  a  Forensic  Psychiatrist.   Her  opinion  was  that  the
    claimant had a moderate depressive disorder, partly caused  by  anxiety
    about his prospective deportation, and partly by witnessing his brother
    commit suicide.  Having been found by  his  brother's  dead  body,  the
    applicant had been admitted  immediately  to  Chelsea  and  Westminster
    hospital, then transferred to Charing  Cross  Mental  Health  Unit  for
    treatment for depression, and Dr  Hunt-Grubbe's  opinion  was  that  if
    removed, the claimant himself might become a suicide risk, deprived  of
    the support of his extended family.

30. Dr Evans at the Claybrook Outpatient Clinic in West  London  considered
    that the applicant had PTSD, and  an  adjustment  disorder.   In  March
    2013, he considered that the applicant should take antidepressants  for
    a further 6 months.

31. Dr  Hoehne  had  explained  that  there  was  very  limited  access  to
    antidepressant  medication  and/or  other  psychological   support   in
    Somaliland due to economic  circumstances  there  and  the  paucity  of
    medical staff.

32. The First-tier Tribunal  dismissed  the  appeal  against  the  decision
    within the Rules, but allowed it under Article 8 ECHR.

Upper Tribunal decision

33. On 3 October 2013, the Upper Tribunal upheld that decision, noting that
    the First-tier Tribunal had identified two competing compelling points:
    on the one hand, the seriousness of the offence,  bringing  with  it  a
    statutory presumption in favour of deportation; and on the other  hand,
    the amount of time the  claimant  had  spent  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    together with the finding that he was unlikely to be in  this  kind  of
    trouble again.  Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins concluded that:

         "50. This may well be the kind of case where the balancing exercise
         could  have  been  determined  differently  and   lawfully   by   a
         differently  constituted  Tribunal.   However,  although   I   have
         reflected carefully on the grounds and Mr Walker's  submissions,  I
         am quite unpersuaded that  the  [First-tier  Tribunal]  misdirected
         itself in any material way or reached a decision that was not  open
         to it for the reasons that it has given."

34. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Court of Appeal judgment

35. The Court of Appeal considered this appeal in a  judgment  reported  as
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v MA (Somalia)  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 48.  The single judgment of the Court of Appeal was handed down  by
    Lord Justice Richards, with whom Lord Justice Ryder and Sir Colin Rimer
    agreed. Richards LJ accepted at [6]-[7] that paragraph 398 as it  stood
    in 2013 was inapplicable to the claimant but  noted  the  2014  changes
    which made it relevant to the assessment of the claimant's  deportation
    now.

36. The Court held that there was a material error of law both in the First-
    tier Tribunal decision and  in  the  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    upholding it. The Court considered that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    given  inadequate  weight  to  the  seriousness   of   the   claimant's
    conviction, which attracted a 10-year sentence; and to the fact that he
    was an adult  at  the  date  when  it  was  committed.   The  principal
    criticism in the Court of Appeal judgment was that both the  First-tier
    Tribunal and Upper Tribunal failed to consider the  appeal  within  the
    framework of the  new  Rules,  or  to  ask  whether  there  were  'very
    compelling reasons to outweigh the public interest in deportation'.  At
    [26], the judgment says this:

         "26. In summary, the tribunal's failure to look at the case through
         the lens of paragraph 398 as interpreted in MF (Nigeria) led it  to
         adopt an insufficiently rigorous approach  towards  the  Article  8
         assessment. It did not apply the substance of the test required  to
         be applied under paragraph 398. The decision it reached  cannot  be
         said to have been the only decision open to a rational tribunal  on
         the evidence before it. It follows that  the  tribunal's  error  in
         considering the case outside the Immigration Rules was  a  material
         error of law. ...

         37.  It follows, in my judgment,  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
         appeal succeeds and that the UT's  decision  to  uphold  the  FTT's
         determination must be set aside. Miss Grange realistically  accepts
         that in those circumstances, having regard to the passage  of  time
         since the matter was considered by the FTT in May 2013, and to  the
         fact that the case now falls for fresh assessment by  reference  to
         paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules as further modified in 2014,
         the appropriate course is  for  us  to  remit  it  to  the  UT  for
         reconsideration."

37. The Court ordered that the appeal should be allowed and remitted to the
    Upper Tribunal for reconsideration, with reference to paragraph 398  of
    the Immigration Rules as amended in 2014.  There is no reference in the
    judgment to section 117 of the 2002 Act.

38. Permission to appeal to the Supreme Court was refused both by the Court
    of Appeal and the Supreme Court itself.  On 22 March 2017, the  Supreme
    Court refused permission to appeal 'because the  application  does  not
    raise an issue of general importance' and ordered that the matter be re-
    determined by the Upper Tribunal in the light of all  the  up-  to-date
    guidance.

39. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

40. The appeal was listed for substantive rehearing in the Upper  Tribunal,
    on the basis that 'absent any challenge to the findings of fact made by
    the First-tier Tribunal, that these are preserved'; that  new  evidence
    or material, including witness statements for further oral evidence  if
    so advised, should be served and accompanied by a rule  15A  statement;
    and that it would be a matter for the Upper Tribunal to decide  whether
    any new material or evidence should be admitted.

41. The Upper Tribunal has received into evidence 141  pages  of  documents
    from the  claimant,  including  updated  witness  statements  from  the
    claimant himself, from his paternal uncle and  his  aunt  by  marriage,
    from his maternal aunt, and from his great aunt,  who  lives  with  his
    maternal aunt and is sometimes, confusingly, referred to  as  'Nan'  or
    his grandmother.  All except  the  great  aunt  gave  evidence  at  the
    hearing: I have taken her evidence into account, Mr  Clarke  indicating
    that it was undisputed.  The witness evidence is set out in Appendix  A
    and will be referred to, where relevant, in this decision.

42. I was provided at the hearing with a  copy  of  the  claimant's  family
    tree, showing that in the United Kingdom, he has his mother and father,
    two sisters and two brothers, his maternal  aunt,  a  great  aunt,  his
    paternal uncle and from his uncle's  wife.  All  of  them  are  British
    citizens.  The  family  tree  gives  details  of  the  claimant's  four
    deceased sisters, who were Somali citizens and who died there,  and  of
    the claimant's brother, a British citizen who  died  in  London  on  25
    December 2012 of multiple injuries, following a suicidal leap from  the
    9th floor balcony of a high building.   Strikingly,  there  is  no  new
    witness evidence from the claimant's mother or  father,  nor  from  the
    second cousin who looked after him in Bristol while he  was  undergoing
    chemotherapy.

43. The medical and country evidence is summarised  at  Appendix  B  below.
    The claimant continues to rely on  Dr  Hoehne's  country  evidence  and
    produces an updated report dated 5 December 2014, postdating the First-
    tier Tribunal decision, but now over 3 years out of date.

44. In addition, the claimant produced the following  medical  and  nursing
    evidence:

       . 3 March 2013. A letter to the claimant from Mr Christian  Howes,  a
         Community Psychiatric Nurse with the West London Mental Health  NHS
         Trust (The Claybrook Centre);

       . 30 March 2016.  A  letter  to  The  Maytrees  Practice  from  Nurse
         Tanyaradzwa  Tande,  senior  registered/mental  health   nurse   at
         Heathrow IRC;

       . 6  April  2016.  A  letter  from  Mr  Ashley  Russell,  a  recovery
         practitioner;

       .  1  September  2017.  A  letter  from  Dr  Lisa  Lowry,  consultant
         haematologist;

       . 4 September 2017. A letter from Dr Rachel  Dodd,  at  The  Maytrees
         Practice, Bristol;

       . 11 September 2017. An up-to-date psychiatric report from Dr  Chiedu
         Obuaya MBBS BSc MRCPsych MBA;

       . December 2012 to August 2017:  Copies  of  the  claimant's  medical
         records.

45. Mr Howes' evidence is not new evidence.  It would have been before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and it records the claimant's state  of  health  in
    April 2013, four months after the  claimant's  mental  health  problems
    began with his brother's suicide on  25  December  2012.   I  place  no
    additional weight on this evidence. Nor have  I  considered  the  early
    medical records because they pre-date the First-tier Tribunal decision.



46. I have, however, considered the medical records kept  by  The  Maytrees
    Practice in Bristol, which reflect the claimant's current circumstances
    since his move to Bristol, and which support Dr Dodd's relatively brief
    medical report.

47. That was the updated evidence before the Tribunal.

Submissions

48. In oral submissions for the Secretary of State, Mr Clarke relied on the
    judgment of the Court of  Appeal  in  MA  (Somalia),  noting  that  the
    claimant would have been about 25 years old at the date of the offence.
     This was a case where there was an incredibly high public interest  in
    removal, following a particularly terrible index crime and two  further
    offences.  Heavy weight should be given to the public interest and  the
    claimant should be returned to Somalia.

49. Although section 117C was  not  mentioned  in  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgment, Mr Clarke noted that the explanatory note  to  the  2014  act
    said that section 117C should be read consistently with paragraphs 338-
    339A of the amended  Immigration  Rules.  The  claimant  was  a  person
    subject to automatic deportation on the basis of his offending history.
     Mr Eaton had confirmed that the claimant did not  rely  on  Article  3
    ECHR but only on Article 8 ECHR. The claimant was  a  foreign  criminal
    and applying section 117C(6), it was necessary to show very  compelling
    circumstances, over and above those sent out  in  section  117C(4)  and
    117C(5).  Section 117C(5) was inapplicable to this claimant.

50. The criminality in this case was very serious.  The claimant had  raped
    a vulnerable pregnant woman in 2007 but had not accepted responsibility
    until 2011.  He had been convicted of possession of cannabis on 21 July
    2012 and of battery while on bail on 16  February  2015.   It  did  not
    appear that the MAPPA reports were before the  First-tier  Tribunal  or
    the Upper Tribunal.

51. The Secretary of State accepted the claimant's history and the findings
    of fact and credibility of the First-tier Tribunal, with  a  number  of
    exceptions.  In particular, she:

      i) disputed the finding of the First-tier  Tribunal  that  there  were
         very significant  obstacles  to  the  claimant's  reintegration  in
         Somalia;

     ii) disputed the finding of the First-tier  Tribunal  that  exceptional
         circumstances had been shown over and above those provided  for  at
         section 117C(4) as Exception 1;

    iii) challenged the finding that the claimant spoke only a few words  of
         the Somali language and could  not  hold  a  conversation  or  make
         himself understood in that language; and

     iv) challenged the finding that the claimant had  family  life  in  the
         United Kingdom  with  any  of  his  immediate  or  extended  family
         members.  The Secretary of State contended  that  no  evidence  had
         been produced  which  was  sufficient  to  establish  any  Kugathas
         dependency amounting to family life.  She relied upon Y v Secretary
         of State for the Home Department in this respect.

52. The  Secretary  of  State  accepted  that  the  claimant  was  socially
    integrated into the United Kingdom and that, given the length  of  time
    he had spent in the UK  since  his  arrival  in  1993,  he  would  have
    established a private life here (see GS (India) & Ors v  The  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 40).

53. However, Article 8 was a  qualified  right.   The  Secretary  of  State
    relied on the decision of the Upper Tribunal in Chege (section  117D  -
    Article 8 - approach) Kenya [2015] UKUT 00165 (IAC) at [29], and in the
    judicial headnote, as to the approach to be taken in Article  8  cases.
    Rehabilitation was not  a  great  factor  in  the  assessment  of  very
    compelling circumstances (see Danso v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 596).

54. The Tribunal should be slow to find that there  were  very  significant
    obstacles to the claimant's reintegration in Somalia.  His private life
    in the United Kingdom was limited to attending Somali caf�s  and  going
    to the library to read thrillers.  The claimant had tried to find  work
    in the United Kingdom but without success, and his stated position  was
    that he was prepared to do anything now.  He  had  acquired  skills  in
    prison in English  literacy,  painting  and  decorating,  and  business
    management.   The claimant had made no enquiries about accommodation or
    employment in Somaliland.  The burden was upon him to show  an  absence
    of opportunity.

55. As regards his Somali language ability, Mr  Clarke  observed  that  the
    claimant communicated with his mother in Somali, and contended that the
    claimant had not established that his Somali was so poor that it  would
    be a very significant obstacle to return.

56. The claimant appeared to have very  little  contact  with  his  family,
    although some members had continued to support  him  after  he  emerged
    from prison.  It was notable that many immediate family members had not
    attended the hearing, including his parents, brothers and  sisters.  No
    satisfactory explanation for  that  absence  had  been  advanced.    Mr
    Clarke asked me to find that some at least  of  the  claimant's  family
    members would be able to help him financially after his return, if they
    wished.

57. The claimant had raised two medical issues, his mental health  and  his
    lymphoma, which was in remission.  Dr Obuaya's psychiatric  report  was
    not favourable to the claimant: it indicated that the claimant's mental
    health problems, although  severe  at  the  time,  were  an  adjustment
    disorder which would self-limit, normally after 5  years.    Mr  Clarke
    observed that 5 years had now passed since the  index  event,  and  the
    claimant's mental health breakdown, which occurred  in  December  2012.
    The claimant was still taking medication, but Dr Obuaya considered that
    he did not need it.  There was no evidence that the claimant  had  made
    use of supportive psychotherapy.

58. As regards the claimant's cancer treatment for lymphoma, the  Secretary
    of State accepted the expert evidence  that  no  cancer  treatment  was
    available presently in Somaliland or Somalia, but the claimant was  not
    receiving treatment at present and his oncologist did  not  expect  his
    cancer to recur for many years.  It was not possible  to  predict  what
    treatment would be available in Somaliland or Somalia, when and if  the
    cancer returned.  The Secretary of State would rely on  Akhalu  (health
    claim: ECHR Article 8) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 400 (IAC) and in  particular
    on the second paragraph of the judicial headnote.

59. In submissions for the claimant, Mr Eaton reminded me that the claimant
    had lived in the United Kingdom for most  of  his  life  and  that  his
    social and cultural integration was undisputed.  He had no known family
    in Somaliland and Mr Eaton asked me  to  find  that  the  claimant  had
    demonstrated  that  there  were  very  significant  obstacles  to   his
    reintegration on return, and/or compelling circumstances over and above
    the section 117C(4) Exception, such that removal would be unlawful.

60. The claimant had good English and had not needed an interpreter at  his
    interview.  He had tattoos which were likely to cause him severe verbal
    harassment on return, and  even  the  risk  of  physical  attack.   The
    claimant was a 'dhaqan celis' (return to culture) person, a group which
    suffered harassment and discrimination in Somalia.

61. Mr Eaton submitted that both the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal
    had failed properly to consider the guidance of the  Grand  Chamber  of
    the European Court of Human Rights  in  Maslov  v.  Austria  -  1638/03
    [2008] ECHR 546, as set out at [71]-[75] of its  judgment,  which  were
    applicable not just to the expulsion of children,  but  also  to  young
    adults who had not yet founded a family of their own.  The claimant had
    always been lawfully in the United Kingdom.

62. The claimant also relied on R on the application  of  Akpinar  v  Upper
    Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) [2014] EWCA Civ 937 in  which
    the Court of Appeal  reviewed  the  application  of  Maslov  in  United
    Kingdom jurisprudence and that of the European Court.   In  this  case,
    the  claimant  had  very  little  previous  contact  with  Somalia   or
    Somaliland, did not really  speak  the  national  language,  and  would
    return to a level of harassment as a  Westernised  dhaqan  celis.   The
    economic consequences of these factors were likely to be severe.

63. Mr Eaton accepted that the claimant had committed  battery  in  prison,
    been fined and pleaded guilty.   He noted the contents of  the  general
    medical practitioner's  letter  and  of  the  psychiatric  report,  but
    contended that neither report was based on detailed  knowledge  of  the
    claimant and his circumstances.  Mr Eaton argued  that  the  claimant's
    mental health would be exacerbated by return to Somaliland,  especially
    as he had a real possibility of a lymphoma  relapse  once  there.   The
    evidence of Dr Hoehne was that his  medication  was  hard  to  get  and
    expensive, and that chemotherapy was hard to  obtain  in  East  Africa.
    People were too poor to commit to supporting extended family members in
    the claimant's circumstances; the claimant had a limited family support
    network and no real prospect of  receiving  money  from  them  when  in
    Somaliland. In this case, despite the gravity of the offences which the
    claimant had committed, Mr Eaton contended that the claimant had  shown
    very compelling circumstances for which he should not be returned.

64. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

Discussion

65. The accepted facts were that the applicant was a member  of  the  Isaaq
    majority clan, with no risk of persecution due to his clan  membership;
    that he had no family or  extended  family  in  Somalia;  that  he  was
    Westernised and might be subject to harassment;  and  that  there  were
    many young people returned to Somalia who did not speak Somali.  At the
    date of the Secretary of State's decision to deport him  on  8  January
    2013, the claimant had been in the  United  Kingdom  since  8  February
    1993, but had been in prison for 5 years of that time.  The  claimant's
    date of birth was 4 March 1982 so at the date of decision on 8  January
    2013, he was 31 years old.  He was not a 'young adult'  in  the  Maslov
    sense.

66. I turn to the family circumstances.  The claimant's parents  travel  in
    and out of the United Kingdom.  They do not appear  to  be  in  contact
    with him or supportive of this  appeal  and  were  not  in  the  United
    Kingdom when he was released from prison.  His paternal  uncle  stepped
    in, for the period when the claimant needed an address, but he also has
    handed the claimant on to other family members, and it is notable  that
    as soon as the tag was removed, and  very  soon  after  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, the claimant left his uncle's house to live with his maternal
    aunt, and then in section  4  accommodation  in  Bristol.   His  second
    cousin took on the role of family support during the claimant's  cancer
    treatment, but now does much less with and for him.

67. The claimant's aunt is  fond  of  him,  but  the  suggestion  that  the
    claimant is at the heart of a large supportive family  network  is  not
    borne out in the evidence before me.  I note that one of the claimant's
    sisters,  his  maternal  aunt,  and  his  great  aunt  ('Nan')   remain
    supportive on the telephone, but that there have not been  many  visits
    since he moved to Bristol. Telephone support could continue when he  is
    returned to Somalia.

68. In 2012, the Immigration Rules were amended to introduce rules 398, 399
    and 399A.  On 8 October 2013, the Court of Appeal held in MF  (Nigeria)
    v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192,
    [2014] 1 WLR 544 that paragraphs 398-399A of the Immigration Rules  (as
    amended) constituted a complete code for the application of  Article  8
    ECHR in deportation cases and there was  no  Article  8  hinterland  in
    which the Secretary of  State  was  required  to  exercise  a  residual
    discretion deciding whether to grant leave to remain outside the Rules.
     So far as relevant to this appeal, the amended Rules are as follows:

         "Deportation and Article 8

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
         to the UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
         Convention, ... the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will
         consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not,
         it will only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the  public
         interest in deportation will be outweighed by other factors.

         399. [inapplicable] ...

         399A.    This paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
         applies if -

              (a) the person has lived continuously in the UK for at  least
              20 years immediately preceding the date  of  the  immigration
              decision (discounting any period of imprisonment) and he  has
              no ties (including  social,  cultural  or  family)  with  the
              country to which he would have to go if required to leave the
              UK; or

              (b) the person is aged under 25 years, he has spent at  least
              half of his life living continuously in  the  UK  immediately
              preceding the date of the immigration  decision  (discounting
              any period of imprisonment) and he  has  no  ties  (including
              social, cultural or family) with  the  country  to  which  he
              would have to go if required to leave the UK."

69. The claimant in this  application  cannot,  therefore,  show  20  years
    continuous residence under paragraph 399A, because  his  residence  was
    interrupted by a period of imprisonment.  Paragraph 399A(b)  also  does
    not apply as he was over 25 years old at the date  of  decision.    The
    amended rules 398 and 399A therefore do not avail him.

70. The Upper Tribunal must also now have regard to  section  117C  of  the
    2002 Act, inserted into that statute by section 19 of  the  Immigration
    Act 2014:

         "117C Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the  criminal.
         ...

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported. ...

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2."

71. When considering this appeal, I have regard to the  serious  nature  of
    the claimant's offence.  He committed offences of  rape  and  attempted
    rape on a pregnant, vulnerable woman from the Somali community, using a
    knife to threaten her.  He forced her to go through  the  stress  of  a
    trial and did not accept responsibility for his actions  for  4  years.
    While in prison, the claimant committed a further offence of  violence,
    and while on licence, a drugs offence. These are very  serious  matters
    and I remind myself that under section 117C(1) of  the  2002  Act,  the
    deportation of foreign criminals such as this claimant is in the public
    interest, and that under section 117C(2), the more serious the offence,
    the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.  The
    exceptions in section 117C(4) and (5) are narrow, even for those  whose
    sentences are shorter than 4 years; for sentences over 4  years,  'very
    exceptional circumstances' over and above the Exceptions must be shown.



72. In the present case, it is accepted that the claimant has been lawfully
    resident in the United Kingdom for most of his  life  and  that  he  is
    socially and culturally integrated here.  The claimant must  show,  not
    just that there are very significant obstacles to his integration  into
    the country to which it is proposed that he be deported, but that there
    is something more: he must  show  that  in  addition,  there  are  very
    compelling circumstances, over and above the very significant obstacles
    to integration, such that his removal is not lawful.

73. I do not consider that there are  significant  obstacles  to  returning
    this claimant to Somalia.  The claimant says that he speaks very little
    Somali.  However, this is an issue on which I  consider  it  proper  to
    remake the finding  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I  note  that  the
    claimant lived in Somalia until he was 11 years old.  I accept that  he
    has good English, but I consider it  more  likely  than  not  that  his
    inability to sustain a conversation in  Somali  has  been  exaggerated.
    The claimant's mother did not attend the hearing  or  provide  any  new
    evidence: the evidence before me is that she speaks only a few words of
    English, and mainly Somali.  The claimant  lived  with  her  until  his
    crime occurred.  His maternal aunt gave her evidence in Somali, and her
    witness statement was translated to her in Somali.  The  claimant  goes
    to Somali caf�s several times a week and has grown up in  the  extended
    Somali community and family network which his  evidence  sets  out.   I
    think it much more likely than not that  the  claimant  has  a  working
    knowledge of Somali, and that his family  members,  whose  evidence  in
    general I accept, have tried to help him by understating his ability to
    speak the language.

74. The other point which is advanced is that the  applicant  is  a  dhaqan
    celis, a return to culture person.  The claimant does not  assert  that
    any ill-treatment he will receive as a dhaqan celis  would  engage  the
    Refugee  Convention,  humanitarian  protection,  or  Article  3   ECHR,
    although he  may  suffer  harassment  and/or  discrimination.   On  the
    claimant's account, dhaqan  celis  are  people  who  have  returned  to
    Somalia after a long time in the United Kingdom.  There is no  evidence
    before me to indicate what the linguistic skills  of  members  of  that
    group may be, but it is more likely than not that many  of  them  speak
    the language of their country of refuge, as well as  Somali,  in  which
    case there may well be a group of English-speaking people in Somaliland
    with whom the claimant could interact.

75. The claimant's cancer is in  remission.   Questions  of  the  available
    treatment thereof in Somalia do not arise, and on the evidence  of  his
    specialist, may not do so 'for many years'.  As regards the  claimant's
    mental health, whilst it is clear that he had a serious breakdown,  the
    evidence as to what treatment he now needs is conflicting.   Dr  Obuaya
    did not consider that the claimant  would  require  any  medication  or
    treatment from psychiatric services on return.

76. Dr Dodd, the claimant's general medical practitioner, took a  different
    view.  Her evidence is based  on  having  known  the  claimant  for  18
    months, when she  wrote  the  report.  Dr  Dodd's  report  is  dated  4
    September 2017.  I have regard to the medical history disclosed in  the
    claimant's notes:  Dr Dodd met him for the first time on 17 March 2016,
    when the claimant told her that he had leave  to  remain  but  'had  to
    serve sentence for actual bodily harm'.  That  rather  understated  his
    criminal history.

77. Dr Dodd's focus was on managing the treatment of the claimant's cancer,
    which began in April 2016, and on stopping him smoking  and  trying  to
    improve his general health.  As regards  mental  health  treatment,  Dr
    Dodd's notes show that the claimant  was  referred  for  mental  health
    treatment but that on 1 April 2016, he told her that he often  did  not
    take one of the drugs prescribed, Aripiprazole, because  his  brother's
    hallucinatory voice disapproved of his taking it,  as  it  stopped  the
    voices.  On 20 April 2016, the claimant told Dr Rebecca van Marle  that
    he was feeling better, with  no  auditory  hallucinations  or  suicidal
    thoughts.

78. The claimant missed his community mental  health  team  meeting  on  18
    April 2016 but Dr van Marle did not consider it necessary  for  him  to
    book a future appointment,  since  he  was  regarded  as  stable.   The
    claimant asked for more medication on 5 occasions up to  October  2016,
    following which there was an abortive medication review on  2  November
    2016, which the claimant did not attend.

79. When seen on 10 November 2016, the claimant was still  out  of  contact
    with the mental  health  team,  sleeping  satisfactorily  and  with  no
    suicidal thoughts.  He had lost his telephone.  On  15  December  2016,
    the claimant was feeling steady  mentally,  with  no  current  suicidal
    plans.  On 29 December 2016, Bristol Mental Health Team  wrote  to  The
    Maytrees Practice, saying that if the claimant did not contact them, he
    would be discharged after 2 weeks.  The following day,  they  told  the
    claimant  the  same  thing.  On  25  January  2017,  the  claimant  was
    discharged by the community mental health team.

80. On 5 May 2017, the claimant was  seen  for  a  medication  review.   He
    seemed well, was  taking  his  medication  regularly,  and  was  having
    frequent contact with family members.  On 16  May  2017,  the  claimant
    missed his next appointment with the surgery.  On 10  August  2017,  he
    was seen by Dr Dodd, who noted that he was anxious  about  removal  but
    still had no suicidal thoughts.  Dr Dodd thought that the claimant  had
    'reasonable health grounds to stay in the United Kingdom'.

81. That evidence is summarised in Dr Dodd's  brief  letter,  in  September
    2017, in which she said  he  was  now  compliant  with  his  medication
    (Mirtazapine, an antidepressant, and  Aripiprazole,  an  anti-psychotic
    drug) and would probably need to remain on it long term.  He was  still
    not under the care  of  the  community  mental  health  team:  Dr  Dodd
    considered it likely that  both  the  claimant's  physical  and  mental
    health would be at risk if he were forced to return.

82. Given the conflict in the medical evidence,  I  have  to  decide  which
    account I prefer.  I remind myself that the evidence of the  consultant
    psychiatrist, Dr Obuaya, was provided by the claimant himself,  as  was
    the evidence of Dr Dodd.  I  prefer  the  evidence  of  the  consultant
    psychiatrist,  Dr  Obuaya,  who  considered  that  the   claimant   had
    experienced an acute episode of Adjustment Disorder at the end of 2012,
    which was likely to resolve over about 5 years.  The  Maytree  Practice
    medical notes support this assessment: the auditory hallucinations have
    not troubled the claimant for a long time  now,  and  he  sleeps  well,
    appears well, and has no suicidal thoughts.

83. I have had regard to the country evidence of Dr Markus  Hoehne,  giving
    it such weight as I can, although it was prepared over 3 years ago  and
    the  witness  was  not  tendered  for  cross-examination.   Dr   Hoehne
    considered that there might be some available medication  of  the  type
    that the claimant took, although not all his sources agreed that it was
    available. I have regard to the conclusion of Dr Obuaya that,  although
    he continues to take it,  the  claimant  probably  does  not  need  his
    medication now.

84. I note that the claimant was able to tell  Dr  Hoehne  that  he  was  a
    member of the Isaaq  majority  clan.  Dr  Hoehne  considered  that  the
    claimant would probably find patrilineal relatives  if  he  looked  for
    them.

85. I am not satisfied on the evidence before  me  either  that  there  are
    significant obstacles to the claimant's reintegration  in  Somalia,  or
    that the risk to the claimant on return to Somalia is so serious as  to
    amount to exceptional circumstances over  and  above  Exception  1  for
    which he cannot be removed.

DECISION

86. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:
    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.
    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by dismissing
    the appeal.

                                 APPENDIX A

                 Witness evidence before the Upper Tribunal

Claimant's evidence

1. The claimant prepared an updated  witness  statement  dated  29  November
   2017.  In that statement, he said that in April 2013, his life  was  very
   difficult; and he referred to his brother's suicide.   The  claimant  had
   been hospitalised for a few days at the beginning  of  2013  and  was  on
   medication: he had never had mental health problems before that sad event
   occurred.  He had been very relieved when his appeal  was  allowed  after
   the May and October 2013 hearings.  He had found the long  legal  process
   since then to be very stressful, as he was constantly worried  about  the
   future.

2. The claimant went on living with his uncle, aunt and  their  children  in
   west London, although it was very crowded, until February 2015.   It  was
   also very near where his brother had killed himself, a constant  reminder
   to the claimant.   After  some  time,  not  understanding  mental  health
   difficulties, he had stopped taking his medication, because he thought he
   could cope, but then his mental health deteriorated again.  He started to
   have auditory hallucinations of his late brother's voice, which sometimes
   did not say nice things. In 2013 and 2014, the claimant  made  3  suicide
   attempts, trying to repeat what his brother had done.

3. The last attempt seems to have been in October 2014,  when  the  claimant
   went to the 9th floor balcony on  the  building  where  his  brother  had
   committed suicide.  He called his  cousin  and  spoke  to  her:  she  was
   worried and came to get him, then took him  to  accident  and  emergency.
   The applicant was admitted to the Hammersmith and  Fulham  Mental  Health
   Unit, where he spent about  two  months.   The  doctors  there  gave  him
   medicine and told him that they  were  worried  he  might  hurt  himself.
   When he was ready to be released, the claimant  reluctantly  returned  to
   live  with  his  uncle.   He  took  his  medication,  and  the   auditory
   hallucinations stopped, but he did not want to leave the  house  and  see
   the building from which his brother had died.  He mostly stayed indoors.

4. The claimant went to see his probation officer after a couple  of  months
   (so, about December 2014).  It went well: afterwards, the claimant sat in
   a park to smoke a cigarette.  Two police officers approached him, and  he
   was arrested because during his illness he had not been reporting to  the
   police station.  He was detained for 4 days, without his medication,  and
   eventually taken to Harmondsworth IRC.   He was  without  his  medication
   there for a further 3 days, and the voices came back.  The  claimant  got
   into a fight.  He pleaded not guilty but  was  convicted  of  assault  by
   beating and fined �1025. The claimant regretted the fight and thought  he
   had learned from it.  He was detained for a further 13 months after  that
   and was on suicide watch most of that time,  with  the  staff  keeping  a
   close eye on him and making notes about everything he did.

5. In August 2015, the  claimant  noticed  a  lump  in  his  neck.   It  was
   identified as cancer and in March 2016, he  was  released  to  section  4
   accommodation in Bristol, and received  chemotherapy  treatment.  In  his
   witness statement, the claimant said that it had been very difficult  for
   him during the treatment.  He went every 3 weeks, from April to September
   2016.  He could not do anything: he was sick a lot and very tired.  After
   his treatment, the claimant would go back to his section 4  address.   It
   was lonely, as he had little support.  Fortunately, the claimant's second
   cousin lived in Bristol and knew a local Somali restaurant.  He said that
   if the claimant ever needed food from there, he would collect and pay for
   it. Sometimes, after the chemotherapy, the claimant's second cousin would
   pick him up and take him home.

6. His family were in London and they were  not  wealthy:  one  brother  and
   another cousin had been down to see him but otherwise,  he  had  not  had
   support from his London family.

7. The claimant had responded well to treatment.  The cancer had  gone,  but
   the claimant continued to be  monitored  every  2  months,  although  his
   chemotherapy treatment had ended. He  would  need  to  be  monitored  for
   another 2 years, until 2020.

8. The claimant said that he felt remorse for his  crime.   He  objected  to
   being returned to Somaliland as he barely speaks the  language,  all  his
   family are here, and he needs to be under medical supervision,  both  for
   his cancer, and for his mental health, in case the voices should return.

9. The claimant gave oral evidence,  on  the  basis  identified  above.   In
   answer to supplementary questions from Mr Eaton, the applicant said  that
   he was still living in Bristol, but came to London to see his family, his
   psychiatrist, and his oncologist, about every two or  three  months.   He
   was taking one dose each of Mirtazapine  and  Aripiprazole,  morning  and
   evening, for his depression.  He was given a  monthly  prescription.   In
   June or July 2017, his sister, brother and another cousin had  come  down
   to London to see him.

10. He had last seen his cancer specialist  in  September/October  2017  and
   had seen his psychiatrist and his family during the same visit to London.
    He said his cancer, which presented  as  a  lump  in  his  neck,  was  a
   lymphoma.  Chemotherapy had ended in October 2016. The cancer would  need
   observation for a further three years, until the end of 2020.

11. When he was having treatment for the cancer, his second cousin had  come
   to pick him up.  He saw him every day during the treatment.  Since he had
   recovered, he still saw his cousin three times a week.

12. In cross-examination, the claimant explained  why  his  mother  had  not
   come to the hearing, although she lived in London.  She had  just  had  a
   leg operation and had been unable to provide a witness statement  because
   she was in hospital.  His mother had returned to Somaliland  in  2005  to
   try to locate relatives and family there but had not returned since then.
   The claimant's mother mainly spoke Somali,  with  just  a  few  words  of
   English, so when he communicated with her, it was mainly in Somali,  with
   a few words of English. It was not true that he had given  his  screening
   interview in Somali.  The interviewer brought a Somali  interpreter  with
   him.

13. The claimant's father had not provided an updated statement, nor did  he
   attend the hearing.  He had done so last time, but the claimant  had  not
   seen his father lately.  Neither parent was working.

14. His second cousin, who had supported  the  claimant  during  his  cancer
   treatment, gave him food but not money  when  he  visited  the  claimant,
   three times a week.  During  the  treatment,  his  second  cousin's  wife
   cooked, and they brought him home cooked food, but now they tended to  go
   out for a meal. His second cousin worked as  a  taxi  driver.   They  had
   spoken about whether if the claimant were  returned  to  Somaliland,  his
   second cousin could send him money there, but it was not practical.  As a
   taxi driver, and with his own family to support, his  second  cousin  was
   not making enough money to spare any.  There was no  statement  from  the
   second cousin: the claimant said there could have been, but his solicitor
   did not mention the possibility.

15. In Bristol, the claimant's main contact was with his second cousin.   He
   also went regularly to the Malcolm X Caf� for  asylum  seekers,  once  or
   twice a week, where he would socialise and get to know  people.   He  had
   met people from Somaliland, Africa, Iraq and Syria.  He would  see  these
   when he went to the Malcolm X Caf�, or other Somali caf�s in Bristol.  He
   probably went to one or other of these caf�s 3 times a week, and he would
   see the same people, who had been here for a long  time.   Some  of  them
   were born in the United Kingdom. He could watch a football  game  in  the
   caf�s or go to the library and borrow books to read, usually thrillers.

16. The claimant was unemployed.   He  had  passed  some  GCSEs  at  school.
   While in prison, he took courses on coping strategies  and  how  to  deal
   with suicidal thoughts.  Between 2006 and 2011, while he was  in  prison,
   the claimant passed levels 1 and  2  in  City  and  Guilds  painting  and
   decorating, BTEC business enterprise, English  Literature  and  Numeracy.
   He had been unable to get any jobs because until these  proceedings  were
   complete, he could not apply for any photographic identification such  as
   a British driving licence, passport or travel document, and without that,
   he could not get work.  He had three or four short-term jobs  in  London,
   and if allowed to work, he would do anything, just to  get  a  job.   The
   applicant accepted that he could use the business skills he  had  learned
   in his  BTEC,  or  his  painting  and  decorating  qualification,  or  do
   cleaning, as he had in prison.

17. If he went back to Somaliland,  it  would  be  more  difficult  for  the
   claimant to use these skills  because  of  the  language  difficulty  and
   because the people would be different. He expected that while it would be
   hard  at  the  beginning,  he  would  probably  get  used  to  living  in
   Somaliland, but his Somali language would never be as perfect as that  of
   someone who was born there.   He  had  looked  at  the  possibilities  of
   living in Somaliland a lot and investigated healthcare  options.  He  had
   not looked at work, or accommodation, as he did not know where to start.

18. Mr Clarke asked about the medication situation.   The  evidence  of  the
   claimant's psychiatrist was that when he returned, he would not need  his
   depression medication any more.  The claimant had spoken to  his  general
   medical practitioner about whether he could come off the medication.   He
   said  he  had  not  read  all  the  psychiatric  reports  but  that   his
   understanding was that if he took his medication with  him  in  time,  he
   would be all right.

19. He had asked his parents  and  the  family  members  who  gave  evidence
   whether they would visit him if he was in Somaliland.  Most of them  said
   that they probably would not do so, because of the  cost  of  travel.  It
   would take their travelling money, which they needed for other journeys.

Claimant's paternal uncle

20. The claimant's uncle is a British citizen.  In his witness statement  of
   29 November 2017, he said that he was the claimant's paternal uncle.   He
   lived in  London,  with  his  wife  and  5  children,  and  worked  as  a
   supermarket cashier at Tesco.  He and his wife  had  known  the  claimant
   nearly all his life.  The uncle looked on the claimant as a son, and  the
   claimant looked up to him as a father figure.

21. When in their family home, the claimant was respectful, always.  He  did
   his chores without being asked, helped to tidy the house,  and  took  the
   children to and from school and the library.  He  was  a  good  listener,
   considerate of people's feelings.

22. The claimant was not the man he had been, 10 years ago.   Then,  he  was
   spending time with people who were a bad influence on him,  getting  into
   trouble, but never having the courage to leave those damaging friendships
   behind. The claimant's uncle thought that his friends had taken advantage
   of the claimant's wish to please them: in the past 10 years, the claimant
   had grown up and was no longer in contact with those bad friends.

23. The claimant had done a terrible thing and was  ashamed.   He  had  told
   his uncle's children, his cousins, many times of his mistakes.   He  told
   his uncle of his dreams, to help young people avoid the mistakes he made,
   to spend more time doing reading or  doing  sport,  rather  than  hanging
   around the street all evening, with too much time on their hands.

24. If returned to Somalia, the claimant's uncle did not know how  he  would
   cope.  Without mental health support or  check-ups  for  his  cancer,  he
   might commit suicide, or the cancer might return, and  he  might  die  of
   that.   His uncle was very scared for him: he thought it would be a death
   sentence.

25. In oral evidence, which  he  gave  through  a  Somali  interpreter,  the
   claimant's uncle adopted his witness statement and was tendered for cross-
   examination.

26. In cross-examination, the uncle said that the claimant was his  sister's
   son.  He did not know why the claimant's  mother  had  not  come  to  the
   hearing, but he thought it was because of the condition of her legs.  The
   claimant had stayed with his uncle and his family after  leaving  prison,
   for about 2 years, and during that time the uncle had provided  financial
   support.  He was not supporting the claimant in Bristol:  another  family
   member had taken on that responsibility,  the  second  cousin  who  lived
   there.

27. The claimant's uncle and his wife were not wealthy: the uncle worked  in
   Tesco, and his wife worked as a carer.  They earned �2200 a month between
   them and had 5 children, aged between 18 and 9 years old.  He had to look
   after his family, and their joint income was only  just  enough  for  the
   current family.  They had large expenses and could not  save  any  money.
   Their house was rented. If the claimant went  to  Somaliland,  his  uncle
   would not be prepared to send  money  to  support  him:  he  thought  the
   claimant's life would be over.

Claimant's aunt by marriage

28. The claimant's aunt by marriage adopted  her  witness  statement  of  29
   November 2017.  The statement had been translated  to  her  by  a  Somali
   interpreter. She confirmed the family relationships, and her  work  as  a
   part time carer.  They had the  claimant  live  with  them  when  he  was
   released from prison in late 2011.  The claimant needed somewhere to live
   and 'his mother's house was overcrowded, and she is away a lot'.  She was
   slightly apprehensive, not knowing how  prison  would  have  changed  the
   claimant.  In fact, prison had changed him; he went in  an  uncaring  boy
   but came out a man.

29. The claimant was quiet.  He spoke less, but listened more, and was  mild
   mannered.  He helped around the house with cleaning and was never in  any
   trouble while he lived with them.  However, the claimant  was  frustrated
   by the strictness of his reporting conditions.   He was not allowed to do
   much.  He would help around the house, and go to the house of  his  aunt,
   where he helped.  He went for walks, but apart from that,  he  spent  his
   time at home.

30. The death of the claimant's brother on 25  December  2012  affected  him
   badly, because he was there  when  it  happened.   The  doctors  were  so
   worried that the claimant was taken to hospital and stayed  there  for  a
   few nights.  He returned to live with his  uncle  and  the  family,  with
   medication.  He was a bit better at first, but then began to  deteriorate
   over the next year or so: his aunt by marriage was not sure that he  took
   his medication as he should.

31. The claimant became less  friendly  and  more  isolated.   He  lost  his
   appetite and would not eat at all for some periods.  He would stay  awake
   all night and walk around the house.  Sometimes  he  did  not  sleep  for
   days.  He was losing weight and getting weaker.  Visits to the doctor  or
   the hospital would help for a time, but then he would deteriorate again.

32. In October 2014, almost 2 years after his illness  began,  the  claimant
   spent two months in hospital.  He improved there and put on  weight.   He
   returned to live with his uncle and the family at the end of 2014 and was
   in better shape: the medication  seemed  to  be  working,  but  then  the
   claimant was detained.  His aunt by marriage could not visit him, because
   of her children, but she spoke to the claimant on the telephone  and  she
   could tell that his health was not good.  Once his cancer was  diagnosed,
   the claimant's voice was badly affected, and he  could  barely  speak  to
   her.

33. Following cancer diagnosis, the claimant was released to  Bristol.   His
   aunt by marriage thought that he might be better  there,  away  from  the
   sight of the building where his brother  killed  himself,  but  she  also
   thought that he was lonely there.  When she spoke to him, she could  tell
   he missed home.   They had regular telephone contact,  and  the  claimant
   had visited London and his uncle's family a few times.

34. The witness considered that the claimant was a friendly,  helpful,  good
   listener, who was  vulnerable  and  in  need  of  medical  and  emotional
   support. She said that his spoken Somali was limited, and he  had  nobody
   in Somalia.  She thought that he would die if he were returned there.

35. There were no  supplementary  questions.   In  cross-examination  by  Mr
   Clarke, the witness confirmed that  while  the  claimant  stayed  at  her
   family  home  in  2011,  they  supported  him  financially  as  well   as
   emotionally.  He ate whatever they cooked for the children, but they  did
   not give him money, except sometimes �5 or �10 for bus fare. The claimant
   was able to borrow clothes from his cousins.  The claimant did not go out
   and socialise: he had been in prison for over 5 years, his former friends
   had dispersed and he was electronically tagged.  She did not think he had
   many friends.

36. The family members in London at present  were  the  claimant's  maternal
   great aunt, his sister and perhaps his parents.  She was not sure whether
   the claimant's parents were in the country at present,  as  the  claimant
   did not have a good relationship with them and his uncle, and his aunt by
   marriage, had no contact with the parents.

37. Before the death of  the  claimant's  late  brother,  that  brother  had
   helped the claimant financially because he was at University and  working
   for the first time.

38. Another sister, who had been a neighbour, gave the claimant  small  sums
   regularly when he lived with the uncle and aunt, because she was  working
   then, but now she was a full-time mother and would not be able to  afford
   to help.  The sister was supported financially as their  mother's  carer,
   because of the mother's disability.  She also got child benefit.  She was
   not working any more, though she had  in  the  past  bee  employed.   The
   sister's husband came and went from the United Kingdom: the aunt was  not
   sure if he was in the United Kingdom now, or whether he was  contributing
   financially to the support of his wife and family here.  The  sister  had
   provided a witness statement and the Tribunal  could  ask  her  what  her
   husband did.

39. If the claimant were returned to Somaliland, the witness  would  not  be
   prepared to assist him financially because she was  a  low-income  earner
   with 5 children to look after, and her husband also  had  a  low  income.
   She did not think it  would  be  a  practical  possibility  for  all  the
   relatives to provide financial assistance to the claimant  on  return  to
   Somaliland.  She could not answer for the claimant's  parents,  but  only
   say what she had been able to give him herself.

40. In re-examination, the claimant's aunt by marriage told  Mr  Eaton  that
   she and her husband were not on good terms with  the  claimant's  family.
   The relationship was through her husband and the families did not contact
   each other.  His parents had not been in  the  United  Kingdom  when  the
   claimant was released from prison: his mother had been having leg surgery
   in France.  She could not remember  whether  the  claimant's  father  had
   accompanied his wife to France during the  surgery,  or  whether  he  was
   somewhere else at the time.

41. The claimant's uncle and his family had agreed to take the claimant  in,
   as he needed a fixed address to be released. Her husband  had  approached
   the witness, saying that this was his nephew, his prison term had come to
   an end, but he had no parents in the country, and that  her  husband  was
   the closest family available and the claimant should live with them.  The
   witness said that she agreed.  When the claimant was no longer tagged, he
   left them and went to live with  and  care  for  his  great  aunt.   That
   continued until his brother's death, when the claimant was hospitalised.

42. There were no further questions for this witness.

Claimant's maternal aunt

43. The claimant's maternal aunt  provided  a  witness  statement  dated  29
   November 2017, which she adopted as her primary evidence in  chief.   She
   said that there had been big changes in the claimant's life: he had dealt
   with severe mental health issues,  been  detained,  been  diagnosed  with
   cancer, and moved to Bristol.   He  had  not  been  the  same  since  his
   brother's  suicide.   Everyone  was  grieving,  but  the  effect  of  the
   brother's death had been worst in the claimant: he sometimes said he felt
   that the death was his fault and that he could have saved his brother.

44. The claimant's aunt confirmed the claimant's history  of  mental  health
   problems after his brother died.  She said that in  late  2014,  she  had
   received a telephone call from the claimant, which  was  not  unusual  as
   they spoke often.  However, on this occasion, he was rambling and  making
   no sense.  She could  tell  that  there  was  something  wrong  with  the
   claimant, so she asked where he was, so that she could check he  was  all
   right.  He was on the 9th floor of the building where she lived,  at  the
   same place as the claimant's brother had been when he jumped.

45. The claimant's aunt rushed up and persuaded the claimant  to  step  away
   from the balcony railings.  He was 'disconnected somehow, like he was not
   all there'.  He agreed to come with her but  was  still  not  making  any
   sense when he spoke.  As the evening went on, he came back to  himself  a
   little but was still not normal.  She thought he would  have  jumped,  if
   she had not been there.   The aunt took the claimant to  hospital,  where
   he did well.  She was proud of him for agreeing to go, given  the  stigma
   about mental health in the Somali community, especially for young men.

46. The witness then gave details of the claimant's cancer  treatment.   She
   had supported him since his release by speaking to him on  the  telephone
   every couple of days.  The claimant had good days and bad, worse when  he
   was stressed.  He was not well,  psychologically  or  mentally.   He  had
   memory issues now and whenever he had a doctor's or lawyer's appointment,
   he would ring his aunt afterwards, in case he forgot what was said.   His
   aunt thought his medication affected the claimant's memory.  She tried to
   reassure him, when they spoke, that the family was not worrying about him
   and everything would be fine.  Her family missed  him:  her  mother  (the
   claimant's great aunt) always wanted to know how he was.

47. The claimant's aunt had been under severe stress  in  2017:  she  had  a
   baby in June and was in intensive care for two weeks, the baby being kept
   in hospital for even longer.  The claimant had visited  her  during  that
   time.  She wished they could see each other more, but it was not possible
   at present.  She, like the other witnesses, thought  that  returning  the
   claimant to Somalia would be a death sentence, if his cancer returned, or
   if he could not get his medication.

48. In her oral evidence, and in  answer  to  supplementary  questions,  the
   aunt confirmed that she  was  a  full-time  carer  for  her  mother,  the
   claimant's great aunt, who was 77 and had a lot of health problems.   The
   aunt's husband was living in Manchester and looking after his own mother.
    He also was unemployed. He provided no financial support for her or  the
   children.  She did not think he had very much.

49. The aunt lived in a council property.  She had last worked in  2014,  as
   a receptionist, but was now married (an Islamic  marriage  only)  with  a
   complicated  marital  situation.   She  and  her  husband  did  not  live
   together, and she had an issue with her brother, because she had to  look
   after her mother, but her husband did not want  him  to  be  there.   The
   Council provided two carers for her mother, four times  a  day,  and  the
   aunt received carer's allowance.  She explained that  looking  after  her
   mother, the claimant's great aunt, was a cultural duty.

50. The witness said that the claimant's mother lived in a  top  floor  flat
   with no lift and had a bad knee.  She was abroad when  the  claimant  was
   released from prison, so he went to  live  with  his  uncle,  because  he
   needed an address.  Most of the family  were  carers  or  cashiers,  just
   about managing economically, so there was no spare  cash  with  which  to
   support the claimant if he was in Somalia.

51. In cross-examination, Mr Clarke asked how long  the  witness  had  lived
   apart from her husband.  She replied that they had never  actually  lived
   together.  She had two children, a child who was now nearly  3,  and  the
   baby born in 2017.

52. The aunt said that she had last worked in January  2014.  When  she  was
   working, she had been able to give the claimant some money while  he  was
   in prison, and for a  time  after  he  was  released,  but  now  she  was
   struggling to cope financially herself.  Her mother had  been  ill  since
   2001 and in 2013 her health problems had become very serious.   The  aunt
   could not do full time work and look after her mother.

53. The claimant did come to visit now and again, and  the  aunt  said  that
   she might give him some money for a bus pass occasionally but  could  not
   do it regularly because she needed to look after her own  children.   The
   aunt did not socialise very well, because she had two small children.

54. The claimant's aunt said that they did not talk about  his  family  when
   they met or spoke.  His mother was unwell, and two of his  brothers  were
   relatively young.

55. In answer to a question from me, the claimant's aunt said that  she  did
   not know why his father had not come to the hearing, as she only saw that
   side of the family occasionally.  She was 'very much not sociable' at the
   moment.

56. There was no re-examination.

Other evidence

57. A witness statement dated 30 November 2017  from  the  claimant's  great
   aunt (also called Nan by the family) was undisputed by the  Secretary  of
   State.  The witness did not give evidence.  The great aunt said that  she
   had known the claimant from a young age, helping  to  bring  him  up  and
   looking upon him as a son.  She said he had nobody  in  Somalia  and  had
   serious health problems.  His Somali language was very limited,  and  she
   doubted whether he would survive if returned to Somalia.

58. When the claimant lived in London, he used to look after his great  aunt
   a lot.  In fact, while his aunt worked, he was his great aunt's full-time
   carer, although her health was already deteriorating then.  She  did  not
   see him often, now that he lived  in  Bristol,  but  when  she  did,  the
   claimant took his great aunt out in her wheelchair and looked after  her.
   They speak frequently on the telephone.

59. The claimant's great aunt considered that the claimant had  learned  his
   lesson and should be given a second chance; that he was older and  wiser;
   and that weight should be given to  his  cancer  and  his  mental  health
   issues.  She asked that he be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom.

                        Medical and country evidence
                          before the Upper Tribunal

Medical evidence

30 March 2016:  Nurse Tanyaradzwa  Tande,  senior  registered/mental  health
nurse at Heathrow IRC

1. On 30  March  2016,  Nurse  Tande  emailed  The  Maytrees  Practice  with
   concerns about the claimant's mental health following  his  release  from
   detention.  Nurse  Tande  was  concerned  that  the  claimant's  suicidal
   thoughts were increasing.  While in  detention,  the  claimant  had  been
   managed on a suicide/self-harm care plan but in  the  community,  he  was
   having auditory hallucinations again and having difficulty  in  complying
   with his medication, particularly the Aripiprazole, to which his deceased
   brother's internal voice objected.

2. Nurse Tande said that the claimant  felt  isolated  in  Bristol,  as  his
   family were in London and he was on a curfew.  He could not travel to see
   them, and they could not afford the expense of the  journey  to  Bristol.
   He had not seen them since his release (the date is  not  given,  but  in
   context, probably the release under section 4 in 2014).

Maytrees Practice Medical Notes

3. The claimant's medical notes show that when Dr Dodd met the  claimant  on
   17 March 2016, he told her that he had been detained near Heathrow  until
   the previous week.  He had leave to remain 'but had to serve sentence for
   actual bodily harm'.  He had been diagnosed with lymphoma  by  Hillingdon
   Hospital and was due to begin chemotherapy soon.   He  had  a  cousin  in
   Bristol but the rest of his family were in London.

4.  On 1 April 2016, the claimant  was  referred  to  the  Community  Mental
   Health Team as urgent  because  of  a  perceived  suicide  risk.  He  was
   awaiting his oncology/haematology appointment and was  anxious.   He  was
   taking  his  Mirtazapine  regularly,  but  often  skipped  the  dose   of
   Aripiprazole  because  he  felt  lonely  and  he   liked   the   auditory
   hallucination of his deceased brother speaking to him, even though  often
   his brother's voice told  the  claimant  to  join  him  in  heaven.   The
   claimant had telephoned the crisis number the previous night.

5. On 8 April 2016, the claimant had started his chemotherapy treatment  for
   the follicular lymphoma and was feeling more positive.  He was  now  only
   signing on once a week at the police station.  He was  due  to  attend  a
   community mental health team meeting on 18 April 2016 and was taking  his
   medication more regularly.  On 20  April  2016,  while  Dr  Dodd  was  on
   holiday, the claimant was seen by Dr Rebecca van Marle, who noted that he
   was feeling better, with  no  auditory  hallucinations  and  no  suicidal
   thoughts.  No future appointments were  booked  as  he  was  regarded  as
   stable and the claimant knew he could see the doctors if  he  needed  to.
   The claimant contacted the doctor for more medication on 15 June 2016, 20
   July 2016, 14 September 2016 and 12 October 2016.   On  2  November  2016
   there was an abortive medication review.

6. On 10 November 2016, Dr Dodd saw the claimant again.  She noted  that  he
   had been out of contact with the mental health team, because he lost  his
   telephone. He was still quite isolated in Bristol, spending most  of  the
   day  indoors.   He  had   no   suicidal   thoughts   and   was   sleeping
   satisfactorily.

7. On 24 November 2016, the claimant said he was trying to give  up  smoking
   and was given a voucher for nicotine replacement  therapy.   He  received
   another voucher on 8 December 2016.

8. On 26 December 2016, the claimant saw Dr Liz Clark  and  had  raised  HDL
   and LDL cholesterol readings.  On 15 December 2016, he saw  Dr  Dodd  and
   was diagnosed with hyperlipidaemia.  He said that he  was  eating  badly.
   He did not know whether there was any family history of  hyperlipidaemia.
   He was feeling steady mentally, had given up on being able to  return  to
   London, and had no current suicidal plans.   He  would  be  seeing  local
   family on two days in the following week, and  was  in  frequent  contact
   (presumably by telephone) with his sister in London.  She had visited him
   in Bristol.  The claimant said he did not receive his invitation  to  the
   last mental health clinic, and that letters often went missing.

9. On 29 December 2016, Bristol Mental Health wrote to the  surgery  to  say
   that he had not contacted them and would be discharged if he did  not  do
   so within 2 weeks. On 30 December 2016, they wrote to  the  claimant,  to
   say that if he did not contact them, they would discharge him.

10. The claimant contacted his doctors about smoking cessation on 9  January
   2017.  On 11 January 2017, he asked for a  repeat  prescription.   On  24
   January 2017, he was referred to the lipid clinic.

11. The claimant was discharged  by  the  community  health  service  on  25
   January 2017 for lack of contact. On 30 January 2017, he failed to attend
   a stop smoking clinic.

12. On 26 April 2017, the claimant asked for more of  his  medications  from
   the surgery.  He had run out, and another prescription was issued.  On  5
   May 2017, the claimant was seen for a medication review.  He was recorded
   as appearing to be well,  awaiting  further  Home  Office  outcomes,  and
   having frequent contact with  family  members,  both  in  person  and  by
   telephone.  He was content not to be on the mental health team  for  now,
   as he could be referred again if needed.  He was  taking  his  medication
   regularly, recognising that this was better for him.  His medication  was
   changed to 'repeat' basis rather than having to be prescribed each  month
   by the doctor.

13. The claimant would be seen again  at  the  end  of  August  2017  for  a
   medication review.  On 16 May 2017, the claimant missed an appointment at
   the surgery, with no  reason  given.   On  27  July  2017,  the  claimant
   contacted the surgery about a letter,  and  on  1  August  2017,  Wilsons
   requested a medical report.  On 10 August 2017, Dr Dodd saw the claimant,
   who had a deportation hearing coming up and had been sleeping  poorly  in
   consequence.  He had no suicidal thoughts at that time, but  was  anxious
   about removal.  He  was  given  a  few  Zopiclone  tablets,  to  be  used
   sparingly.  The doctor noted that 'I would have thought he has reasonable
   health grounds to stay in the United Kingdom'.

6 May 2016: Ashley Russell, recovery practitioner with  the  Bristol  Mental
Health Central and East Assessment and Recovery Team

14. Ashley Russell wrote to the claimant to record the outcome of  a  mental
   health assessment  on  5  May  2016.   The  dates  are  hard  to  follow,
   particularly as the general medical  practitioner's  referral  was  on  1
   April 2016.  I think it likely that the date of the letter  should  be  6
   May 2016, but nothing turns on that.  The claimant was said to have  been
   released from detention about 8 weeks ago and to be in bail accommodation
   in Bristol: the claimant had been moved from London and was  not  allowed
   to visit London, as part of his bail conditions.   The claimant had  been
   an in-patient in hospital in 2013 and 2014, both times for about 8 weeks.



15. His cousin in Bristol  was  not  in  contact  with  the  claimant.   The
   claimant's sister had visited him once in Bristol.  The claimant  had  no
   detectable thought disorder or disturbance of perception,  save  that  he
   heard his brother's voice.  The claimant knew nobody in Bristol.  He  was
   being treated  for  follicular  lymphoma  with  chemotherapy,  which  had
   affected his appetite and weight.  The  claimant's  mood  was  'down  and
   lonely', but he had never had any talking therapy to assist him with  his
   brother's death and the effect it had on the claimant.

16. The Recovery Team would allocate a  case  worker  to  get  to  know  the
   claimant and fully  to  assess  his  mental  health  needs  and  auditory
   hallucinations, including seeing whether there were steps which could  be
   taken to help address his social isolation.    The letter was  copied  to
   Dr Dodd, the claimant's general medical practitioner.

1 September  2017:  Dr  Lisa  Lowry,  Consultant  Haematologist,  University
Hospital Bristol

17. Dr Lisa Lowry stated that the  claimant  had  a  low  grade  non-Hodgkin
   lymphoma but with suspicion, both clinically  and  histologically,  of  a
   transformation to a more aggressive high-grade  type.  The  claimant  had
   received 6 cycles of intensive chemotherapy, which produced a  very  good
   response.  He was in  clinical  remission,  but  unlikely  to  have  been
   'cured'. Prolonged  periods  of  remission  were  typical  for  low-grade
   lymphoma, which would usually progress at  some  point,  but  respond  to
   further lines of chemotherapy.   The  expected  survival  period  was  15
   years.

18. The current position was summarised as follows:

         "He  is  not  currently  receiving  any  specific  therapy  but  is
         attending clinic every so often for observation and  monitoring  of
         signs and symptoms.  It is likely that at some point in the  future
         he would experience progressive lymph node enlargement and  require
         further therapy.  It is very difficult to know when that might  be,
         and I am hopeful that it might be quite a few years in the  future.
         ... As I said, the future is bright for further lines  of  therapy.
         However, I would have concerns  about  him  being  able  to  access
         adequate medical care should he return to Somalia.   It  is  likely
         that if he were denied further follow-up and future  treatment  for
         his lymphoma, that his life expectancy would be shortened."

Dr Rachel Dodd, claimant's general medical practitioner

19. Dr Rachel Dodd first met the claimant on 17 March 2016 and  oversaw  his
   mental health and oncology referrals, seeing the claimant frequently  for
   those purposes.  Dr Dodd is not an oncology specialist. Dr Dodd said that
   she was not qualified to comment on the risk of lymphoma relapse, nor  on
   the outcome should the claimant  be  unable  to  access  treatment.   She
   recommended that such questions be directed to his  oncology  specialist,
   Dr Lisa Lowry, at Bristol Hospital Oncology Centre.

20. Concerning the  claimant's  mental  health,  Dr  Dodd  was  aware  of  a
   diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia in his prison notes  in  March  2015,
   and of a history of auditory hallucinations and  suicide  attempts.   The
   voices the claimant heard were his late brother, asking the  claimant  to
   join him.  The claimant had reportedly tried to take his own life 3 times
   before Dr Dodd met him in  March  2016,  one  of  which  resulted  in  an
   admission to the Claybrook Unit.

21. The claimant was taking 45 mg of Mirtazapine (an antidepressant) and  15
   mg of Aripiprazole (an anti-psychotic) each day.  His compliance with his
   medication was good.  Avon  and  Wiltshire  Mental  Health  Services  had
   discharged him in January 2017, with an open door for further referral if
   needed.   Dr  Dodd  expected  that  the  claimant  would  need  long-term
   medication.

22. In relation to the hearing, Dr Dodd considered that the  claimant  would
   need regular breaks and extra care when explaining complex matters.   Her
   understanding was that the claimant had lived in the United Kingdom since
   he was 8 years old, mostly in London, and that he had a network of family
   support here which would not be replicated in Somalia.    She  considered
   it 'very likely that both his physical and mental health would be at risk
   if he were forced to return'.

11 September 2017: Dr Chiedu Obuaya, Consultant Psychiatrist

23. Dr Chiedu Obuaya MBBS  BSc  MRCPsych  MBA  prepared  his  report  on  11
   September 2017, after seeing the claimant at his solicitors' offices on 4
   September 2017.  He read the Joint Presidential Guidance note and  stated
   that the claimant was fit to give evidence.  It was not his opinion  that
   any specific provisions or support  needed  to  be  provided  before  the
   claimant could do so.

24. Dr Obuaya acknowledged that he had no expertise on  the  conditions  the
   claimant would face in Somalia.  His conclusions on the  risk  on  return
   are plainly outside his expertise and I place no weight on them, applying
   the Icarian Reefer guidelines, to which the report was prepared.

25. Dr Obuaya considered that the claimant  fulfilled  the  criteria  for  a
   short-term  Adjustment  Disorder  as  categorised  in  the   WHO   ICD-10
   classification of diseases.  He did not consider that the claimant had  a
   depressive illness, nor that he had any  psychotic  illness.   Adjustment
   disorders were self-limiting conditions, short-lived  by  definition  and
   neither severe  nor  enduring  in  nature.   Most  patients  had  a  good
   prognosis with only 13-17% still having a major mental health disorder, 5
   years on.  Bereavement  counselling  or  supportive  psychotherapy  might
   help.  The claimant had no chronic substance misuse problems.

26. The claimant was negatively affected by his poor physical health,  long-
   term unemployment and limited support network.  However, he  presented  a
   low  short-term  risk  of  completed  suicide,  lacking  active  suicidal
   ideation.  It might increase to moderate to high on hearing that he would
   definitely  return  to  Somalia,  but  on  return,  the  risk  would  not
   definitely be high as there was  no  history  of  suicidal  behaviour  in
   Somalia. Regular monitoring could minimise the risk.

27. The applicant remained a moderate to high risk  of  re-offending,  given
   the serious nature of his conviction, and his having received a fine  for
   cannabis possession in the last two years before the preparation of  this
   report.  If the claimant was unable to secure regular income or  maintain
   stable housing, there was a risk that he would turn to criminal means  to
   support himself.  For the moment, his housing was reasonably stable,  but
   NASS support gave him a limited source of  income.   His  family  members
   might support him to live a pro-social life in future: his risk of repeat
   sexual or drug offences was low.

28. Turning to the mental health consequences of removing  the  claimant  to
   Somalia, Dr Obuaya considered that return there would  be  stressful  and
   might exacerbate the claimant's accessing mental health services there if
   he required them or make it more difficult for him to engage in the tasks
   necessary  to  establish  a  new  life,  such   as   finding   work   and
   accommodation.

29. Dr Obuaya's opinion was that

         "74. From a purely psychiatric viewpoint, given the diagnosis of an
         adjustment disorder, a  return  to  Somalia  need  not  necessarily
         impact adversely on [the claimant's] mental health or his  capacity
         to remain safe.  He would not, in my clinical opinion, require  any
         medication or treatment from psychiatric services there if returned
         there."

30. That was the updated medical evidence.

5 December 2014:   Country report of Dr Hoehne

31. The country expert report of Dr Hoehne is  significantly  out  of  date.
   At [9], Dr Hoehne sets out UNHCR  findings  that  there  is  some  formal
   mental health care in Somalia, including three mental health  departments
   in Hargeisa, Boroma and Burao, and two dedicated mental health  hospitals
   in Berbera and Gebilay.  The Berbera hospital had been transformed from a
   prison to a mental health hospital with the assistance of NGOs.  Families
   were required to sign a non-abandonment  contract  to  ensure  that  they
   would pay for and provide  resources  to  the  patient  throughout  their
   treatment. There were mental health facilities in Bosaso General Hospital
   in Puntland, and an outpatient  only  facility  at  the  Galkayo  General
   Hospital, as well as mental health services  in  Mogadishu.   There  were
   also at least 11 private centres in Somaliland, four in Puntland and  two
   in Mogadishu, although conditions were poor in those hospitals.

32.  Mental  health  training  was  being  introduced  across  Somalia   and
   Somaliland, supported online before and after through a partnership  with
   King's College London.  Since 2008, Hargeisa and Amoud University Medical
   Schools included formal mental health training in their courses.  A short
   mental health course  was  included  in  the  undergraduate  medical  and
   nursing  school  curricula  in  Somaliland,  and  international   experts
   regularly organised trainings and online support,  as  well  as  sporadic
   mental health courses organised by the World Health Organisation and  the
   Italian non-governmental organisation, GRT.

33. Evidence of the availability of Mirtazapine and Aripiprazole in  Somalia
   was confusing.  Dr Hoehne's  contacts  suggested  that  availability  was
   limited and expensive, if the medications  were  available  at  all,  and
   mainly in bigger pharmacies in Hargeisa, Somaliland's capital.  A monthly
   dose, on prescription, cost about $25.

34. Cancer was not treatable in Somaliland or Somalia:  chemotherapy  simply
   was not available.  Basic knowledge of the disease was very limited.

35. The claimant was a member of an Isaaq clan and would be very  likely  to
   find some patrilineal relatives if he searched for them.   He  would  get
   some short-term family assistance from them, but then  probably  have  to
   fend for himself.   His broken Somali  and  lack  of  cultural  knowledge
   would also be unhelpful.  The unemployment rate was very  high  and  even
   low-paid jobs needed family connections.   There  was  no  mental  health
   system in Somaliland.  If he became ill again, the  claimant  would  most
   probably become totally destitute.

36. Family members would be unwilling  to  support  him  for  long  periods,
   because of the complexity of the  claimant's  health  problems.   If  his
   lymphoma returned, he would die from that illness.

37. The report has not been updated for over three years and Dr  Hoehne  was
   not available at the hearing to assist  the  Tribunal  in  assessing  the
   weight to be given to his evidence.
