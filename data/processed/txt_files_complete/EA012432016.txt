Between:
                             Muhammad Tariq Khan
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                            Decision and Reasons


 1. The Tribunal issued a direction on 20 December 2017 requesting that the
    parties provide written reasons within 7 days as to why an error of law
    should not be found and the appeal remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
    following Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

 2. No response was received from  either  party  within  7  days  and  the
    Tribunal therefore finds an error of law  such  that  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Flynn is set aside and remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal at Taylor House to be re-made de novo.
