                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  I
    Burnett, promulgated on 27  October  2016.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Resident Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Zucker on 31 March
    2016.

Anonymity

   2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason for  one
      now



Background

 3. The appellant first arrived in the United Kingdom on  22  October  2009
    with leave to enter as a student, valid until 25 February  2013.  On  1
    December 2012, he applied for further leave  to  remain  under  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur). That application was refused on 22 August 2013  because
    the evidence of funds submitted by the appellant was not in  accordance
    with paragraph 41 of Appendix A; he had not provided evidence  that  he
    had passed a test  in  reading  and  writing  English  as  required  by
    Appendix B of the Rules and the evidence of funds was dated  more  than
    31 days prior to the date of the application and did not therefore meet
    the requirements of Appendix C.

 4. The appellant appealed the decision of 22 August 2013  and  his  appeal
    was allowed. That decision was set aside by the Upper Tribunal on 9 May
    2014 and remade, allowing the appeal on  the  limited  basis  that  the
    respondent's decision was not in accordance with the law and  therefore
    the appellant's application remained outstanding before  the  Secretary
    of State. The error made by the Secretary of State was  in  failing  to
    have proper regard to paragraph 245AA of the Rules.

 5. The respondent reconsidered the appellant's Tier 1 application  and  on
    23 October 2015, a decision was made to refuse  the  appellant  further
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  Firstly,  the  application  was
    refused under  paragraph  322(1A)  of  the  Rules  because  Educational
    Testing Service (ETS) had informed the respondent that the  appellant's
    TOEIC certificate in relation to a test taken at Elizabeth  College  on
    22 August 2012  was  fraudulently  obtained.  Secondly,  the  appellant
    continued to fail to provide the  specified  evidence  in  relation  to
    access to funds set out in paragraph 41 of  Appendix  A.  Thirdly,  the
    appellant failed to provide a bank statement dated no more than 31 days
    prior to the date of the application. The decision letter  advised  the
    appellant  that  further  information  had  not  been  requested  under
    evidential flexibility as "instructed" by the  Upper  Tribunal  because
    the application fell to be refused on other grounds.  In  addition,  it
    was said that the information regarding deception  was  received  after
    the first decision on this application was made, that is on  22  August
    2013.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant sought  an
    adjournment to obtain further evidence regarding the maintenance issue.
    That application  was  refused  as  the  parties  agreed  that  if  the
    appellant succeeded on the deception issue, he would  also  succeed  in
    his  argument  that  the  respondent  failed  to  consider   evidential
    flexibility under the Rules by seeking further evidence. The  appellant
    alone gave evidence and denied that he used a proxy during his  English
    language test. The judge found  that  the  evidence  submitted  by  the
    respondent discharged the initial burden of proof which was upon her.

 7. For various reasons, the judge concluded that the appellant had not put
    forward an innocent explanation and dismissed his  appeal  against  the
    refusal under Tier  1.  The  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds  was  also
    dismissed.



The grounds of appeal

 8. The grounds of appeal in support of the  application  argued  that  the
    judge failed to consider  the  evidence,  the  case  law  and  was  not
    entitled to conclude that the appellant cheated when he had the ability
    to pass the test. Furthermore, the judge was wrong  to  determine  that
    there was no evidence the appellant had asked for his individual  voice
    recording,  there  was  no  recognition  of  the  appellant's  previous
    successful appeal in which the same TOEIC certificate was in issue  and
    there was a failure to consider the appellant's private life.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the  judge  arguably
    erred in "placing the burden  of  proof  upon  the  Respondent."  While
    permission was not refused on any ground, Judge Zucker noted that there
    was no real reliance placed on human rights by the appellant.

10. The respondent's Rule 24 response, received on 20 April 2017  indicated
    that the appeal was opposed and that the judge  correctly  referred  to
    the initial burden of proving fraud being on the respondent.

The hearing

11. Mr Murphy made three succinctly expressed points. Firstly, at [27]  the
    judge had stated that the burden of  proof  was  on  the  appellant  to
    establish the facts and indeed the grant  of  permission  was  on  that
    basis. Mr Murphy conceded  that  [29]  and  [42]  indicated  otherwise,
    however he argued that the judge was confused on this matter.

12. Secondly, he argued that it was not likely that the appellant, who gave
    evidence in English, would cheat if he could pass the English  language
    test and in this he relied on [89] of SM and Ihsan Qadir v SSHD  [2016]
    UKUT 229 (IAC) where a similar argument was raised, as set out below;

    "We are satisfied, objectively, that at the stage when  this  Appellant
    took the tests in question there was no need for him to engage  in  any
    form of cheating.   He  would  have  been  sufficiently  proficient  in
    English   to   secure   the   necessary   qualification   legitimately.
    Furthermore, given  his  extensive  familiarity  with  the  immigration
    system, he would have been aware of the grave consequences of any  form
    of deception.  To have cheated would have entailed engaging in  a  game
    of risk with very high stakes indeed.  Furthermore,  having  considered
    all the evidence, we have no reason to question  the  Appellant's  good
    character generally.

13. Thirdly, as to the judge's findings at [36] regarding the appellant not
    having contacted ETS to ask for the voice recordings, Mr  Murphy  asked
    me to note that the appellant mentioned having  tried  to  contact  his
    college for evidence that  he  sat  the  examination,  however  it  was
    closed.



14. Mr Clarke argued that the grounds were misconceived. He relied  on  the
    rule 24 response, expanding upon it to  take  me  through  the  judge's
    decision in considerable detail. He asked me to find that  the  judge's
    findings were comprehensive, followed Qadir, they took into account all
    of the evidence and resulted in no error of law.

15.  Mr Murphy had very little to add.

16. At the end of the hearing, I announced  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge made no error of law and that his decision was upheld. My reasons
    are set out below.

Decision on error of law

17. Addressing the issue of the burden of proof, it is  the  case  that  at
    [27] the judge set out the general burden of proof in his detailed five-
    paragraph self-direction as to the burden and standard  of  proof.  The
    judge did not err in starting in this  manner,  given  there  were  two
    other matters at issue in this appeal, other than the deception  issue.
    In any event at [29] the judge correctly identifies that the burden  of
    proving fraud is on the respondent; he appropriately  directed  himself
    with regard to Qadir and SSHD v Shehzad & anor [2016] EWCA civ  615  as
    well as to the civil standard, following the approach of Lady  Hale  in
    Re B(Children) [2008] UKHL 35 [2009].  Thereafter at [32] and [33]  the
    judge  correctly  directs  himself,  referring  to  the  aforementioned
    authorities,  before  concluding  at  [33];  "the  respondent  provided
    sufficient evidence of fraud in respect of this case for the  appellant
    to provide an explanation."

18. Having rightly found that the respondent  had  discharged  the  initial
    burden of proof, the judge undertook a fact-sensitive assessment as  to
    whether the appellant had provided an innocent explanation.  The  judge
    provided a series of sustainable reasons, noting  that  the  respondent
    provided more evidence in  the  instant  appeal,  in  the  form  of  an
    Operation Faï¿½ade report into Elizabeth College and an expert report  of
    Dr French, than had been provided in Qadir, where the  respondent  only
    just discharged evidential burden.

19. The judge was entitled to take into account the Project  Faï¿½ade  report
    which showed that there was a significant prevalence of invalid reports
    at the College concerned in general and that on the date the  appellant
    said he took his tests, 76% of the tests were declared invalid with the
    remainder  being  termed  questionable.  The   judge   considered   the
    appellant's explanation or rather  assertion  that  he  did  not  cheat
    against the background of  the  prevalence  of  cheating  at  Elizabeth
    College. Mr Murphy's arguments did not adequately address the relevance
    of the appellant attempting to obtain evidence to support his case from
    the college which had been closed-down. The  judge  rightly  considered
    his failure, despite being  represented,  to  contact  ETS  to  dispute
    matters or to ask for his individual voice recording and took this into
    account along with all the other evidence  before  him.  The  appellant
    adduced nothing other than his unsupported account as evidence that  he
    did not cheat. As remarked upon by the judge, he  had  no  witness  nor
    independent evidence to support his contentions and  his  own  evidence
    was found by the judge to be "lacking in  substance  and  detail."  The
    latter finding was not challenged.

20. It is recorded by the judge as part of  his  findings  and  conclusions
    that the appellant  provided  his  explanations  in  English.  He  also
    considered the argument that the appellant would have no good reason to
    cheat. but for reasons set out at [37] the judge did  not  accept  that
    this was determinative of the deception issue.

21. Mr Murphy concentrated his submissions upon the appellant's ability  to
    give his evidence in English  and  maintained  that  this  removed  any
    incentive to cheat. I note what was said in  Qadir  at  [80]  regarding
    such simplistic conclusions;

    "In some of the FtT decisions in  this  field  one  finds  observations
    concerning the appellant's apparent fluency in,  and  command  of,  the
    English language.  We  consider  that  Judges  should  be  cautious  in
    adopting this approach for at least three reasons.  The  first  is  the
    passage of time.  The second is that Judges are not language testing or
    linguistics experts.  The third is that, to date,  there  has  been  no
    expert linguistic evidence in any of these cases. "

22. Given that the appeal concerns test results dating from 22 August  2012
    and the appeal was heard over 4 years later, the weight the judge  gave
    to the appellant's English language ability and  whether  this  removed
    the motivation to cheat cannot be impugned.

23. The approach of the judge in deciding the  deception  issue  cannot  be
    faulted in any respect.

Conclusions


The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

The decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  I  Burnett  is  upheld  in  its
entirety.

No application for anonymity was made and I saw no reason  to  make  such  a
direction.
