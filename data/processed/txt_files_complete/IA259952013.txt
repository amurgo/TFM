                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                 Olivia Addo
                                                                  Respondent




                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

1. The Secretary of State has permission to appeal  against  the  First-tier
   Tribunal determination allowing the claimant's appeal against her refusal
   to issue the claimant a residence card as the wife of a German  national,
   on the basis that her husband is an EEA citizen exercising Treaty  rights
   in the United Kingdom under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
   Regulations 2006 (as amended).  The marriage relied upon was a  customary
   Ghanaian marriage.

2. On 9 July 2014, Upper Tribunal Judge Craig found a material error of  law
   in the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge CMA Jones, on the basis
   that when considering the customary Ghanaian marriage relied upon,  Judge
   Jones failed to apply the guidance given in Kareem (proxy marriages -  EU
   law) [2014] UKUT 000024 (IAC).  He gave directions for  the  remaking  of
   the determination on a date to be fixed and specified the evidence  which
   the claimant would be required to produce, applying Kareem.

3. By a letter dated 11 August 2014, the claimant's  representatives  stated
   that they were 'instructed to withdraw the above appeal on behalf of  the
   [claimant]'.  No reason was given.

4. Pursuant to paragraph 17  of  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
   Rules 2008 (as amended), the permission of the Upper Tribunal is required
   for such withdrawal.  On behalf of the Upper Tribunal, I consent  to  the
   withdrawal both of the underlying First-tier Tribunal appeal and  of  the
   claimant's case before the Upper Tribunal.

5. The appellant's case having been withdrawn, there is no  longer  a  valid
   appeal before the Upper Tribunal.
