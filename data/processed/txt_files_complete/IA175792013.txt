                            ALECIA MELACE PITTER
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent




                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

1. The appellant, a Jamaica citizen, has permission to  appeal  against  the
   First-tier Tribunal determination refusing her leave  to  remain  in  the
   United Kingdom on Article 8 ECHR grounds, either within  or  without  the
   Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended).

2. Following an error of law hearing on 28 July 2014, Deputy Upper  Tribunal
   Judge Lever set aside the First-tier Tribunal determination  and  ordered
   that the Upper Tribunal remake the decision on a date to be  fixed.   The
   substantive hearing is fixed for Monday 13 October 2014.

3. By an email dated 15 September 2014, Jein Solicitors, who  represent  the
   appellant, stated that  they  were  instructed  to  withdraw  the  appeal
   because she has made an  application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain,
   presumably on a different basis, and  no  longer  wishes  to  pursue  the
   current appeal.

4. Pursuant to paragraph 17  of  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
   Rules 2008 (as amended), the permission of the Upper Tribunal is required
   for such withdrawal.

5. On behalf of the Upper Tribunal, I consent to that withdrawal.
