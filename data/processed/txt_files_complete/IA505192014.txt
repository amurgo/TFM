Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr L Youssefian (D J Webb and Co Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills (Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of Folasade Jumoke Adebayo, a citizen of Nigeria born
   6 October 1965, against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
   dismiss her appeal against the decision of the Respondent of 1  December
   2014 to refuse her application for further leave to remain  and  to  set
   removal directions against her  under  section  47  of  the  Immigration
   Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


2. She entered the United Kingdom as the spouse of Soloman  Adebayo  on  10
   November 2007 and was granted leave until 24 July 2009;  an  application
   for settlement as  a  spouse  subsequently  failed,  and  appeal  rights
   against that decision were exhausted on 12 October 2010. On 23 September
   2011 she was subsequently granted Discretionary Leave  to  Remain  (DLR)
   until 23 September 2014; it is  against  the  refusal  of  a  subsequent
   extension request that this appeal now arises.


3. The application was refused because the relationship with Mr Adebayo was
   no longer subsisting, and she could  not  demonstrate  very  significant
   obstacles to her integration  in  Nigeria.  There  were  no  exceptional
   circumstances warranting departure from the Immigration Rules.


4. The Appellant's evidence on appeal below was that she had  worked  as  a
   qualified nurse in a government hospital in Nigeria  for  twelve  years,
   marrying Mr Adebayo in May 2006. She had applied for settlement  as  his
   wife in July 2009, following a period  over  which  she  lived  in  Bath
   during the week to pursue nursing studies whilst her husband remained in
   London. These living arrangements meant  they  could  put  forward  only
   limited proof of cohabitation. As a result the Home Office  had  invited
   them to interview to assess the reality of their marriage, and concluded
   that it was not genuine and subsisting.


5. On appeal against that decision Judge Kamara for the First-tier Tribunal
   found that she was not in a genuine relationship with  her  husband  and
   that her removal would be proportionate  given  that  she  had  obtained
   entry on the basis of a false claim to be in a genuine relationship, one
   wholly undermined by the fact she had lived separately from her  husband
   from the time of her arrival; her private  life  connections  here  were
   founded on that dishonesty.


6. Her relationship with her husband began to breakdown in early 2010,  and
   he mistreated her. She confided in her pastor but  did  not  report  the
   matter to the police. She applied to regularise  her  position  in  July
   2011, stating in cross examination that she did so as a spouse; this was
   refused but she received DLR outside the Rules.


7. She now lived in Birmingham in a rented property  paying  �310  monthly,
   working as a Care Assistant  earning  around  �1,000  monthly.  She  was
   heavily involved in the Kingdom Life Apostolic Church which she attended
   twice  weekly,  and  was  a  member  of  the   International   Christian
   Association, giving talks on the Christian faith. She felt that she  had
   nothing to return to in Nigeria as her parents were dead, and her sister
   and brother could not support her, indeed presently she  remitted  funds
   to them, the former being a widow with  five  children  and  the  latter
   being unemployed. When she returned to the country she had to stay in  a
   hotel rather than with them. Her qualification in  Nigeria  had  expired
   and she would not be able to support herself using her  nursing  skills.
   She argued that having been granted DLR in September  2011  she  benefit
   from the transitional policy statement of June 2012 which set  out  that
   those granted DLR before 9 July  2012  would  continue  on  a  route  to
   settlement subject to passing criminality tests.


8. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the  appeal  under  the  private  life
   route  because  the  Appellant  could  not  establish  an  inability  to
   integrate in Nigeria. Considering her case outside the Rules, it was not
   accepted that she lacked social and cultural ties there,  nor  that  she
   had shown that her nursing qualifications would no longer be valid.  She
   was familiar with the local language and could be expected  to  maintain
   her friendships in this country, using  modern  means  of  communication
   from abroad. As to her arguments based on her past grant  of  DLR,  that
   had apparently been made in error, given the only apparent justification
   for it was the fact of her continued status as the wife of her  husband,
   overlooking the findings of Judge Kamara and indeed  the  Home  Office's
   own past assessment of her circumstances as not involving a  genuine  or
   enduring  relationship.  Accordingly  refusal  of  further   leave   was
   appropriate applying Rule 322(1) because the grounds on  which  she  was
   previously granted DLR no longer persisted.


9. Grounds of appeal alleged that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in  law
   in failing to identify any material change of circumstances, absent firm
   evidence as to the basis of the grant of DLR, and  indeed  ignoring  the
   concession made by the Presenting Officer below to  that  effect.  Judge
   Keane granted permission to appeal on 12 June 2015  for  the  First-tier
   Tribunal,  identifying  the  arguable  error  of  law  as  the   judge's
   presumption as to the basis for leave in the light of the concession.


10. At a previous hearing of  the  appeal  the  proceedings  were  adjourned
   because of the need for the Appellant's  representatives  to  assimilate
   and digest the evidence sought to be adduced by way of a Rule 15A notice
   by the Secretary of State. That evidence takes the form of General  Case
   Information Database (GCID) Case Record Sheets recording that  in  truth
   the grant of leave was based on the belief that the Appellant was  in  a
   subsisting  relationship,  she  having   provided   further   proof   of
   cohabitation from March 2009 until August 2011. The minute records  that
   she had been married to a British citizen since May 2006 and  had  lived
   here since November 2007 and had built a private and family  life  here,
   and that there was now sufficient evidence of cohabitation  provided  to
   justify the grant of DLR (the grant of leave taking  place  outside  the
   Rules because the timing  of  the  application  constituted  her  as  an
   overstayer). Following referral to a supervisor the provisional decision
   to grant DLR was endorsed. On 3 September 2012 the receipt of  a  letter
   is recorded, in which Mr Adebayo stated that he was no longer supporting
   his wife's claim to stay in this country as she had left him.


11. Mr Youssefian submitted that there had been no  clear  communication  of
   the basis of leave being granted from the Respondent to  the  Appellant,
   leaving her uncertain as to the basis on  which  she  had  been  granted
   leave and thus unclear as to how to conduct herself in the future.   The
   First-tier Tribunal could not  have  concluded  there  to  have  been  a
   genuine  change  of  circumstances  without  making  an   evidence-based
   assessment as to the basis for the original grant  of  leave.  The  case
   note did not unequivocally show that marriage was the sole basis of DLR:
   the phrase "private and family life" appeared at one point.


12. For the Secretary of State, Mr Mills submitted that  the  minute  as  to
   the basis for leave being granted  should  be  admitted  into  evidence,
   either at the error of law stage, his preferred position though  one  he
   sensibly admitted suffered from the disadvantage  that  the  failure  to
   adduce it sooner was essentially unexplained, or, if error  of  law  was
   found, upon the re-determination of the  appeal  that  would  inevitably
   follow. The minute made it clear that, whilst  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   might be criticised for speculation on the state of the evidence  before
   it, it had nevertheless come to the right conclusion and one with  which
   the Upper Tribunal should agree.


Findings and reasons


13. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal  against  the  decision  to
   reject the Appellant's case as to the  compatibility  of  her  expulsion
   with the private life requirements of the Immigration Rules, or with the
   broader conception of Article 8 ECHR outside those Rules. The sole issue
   is whether the Respondent's approach to her own  Guidance  was  correct.
   That sets out:


           "Transitional Arrangements
           ( All decisions made on Discretionary Leave on or after  9  July
           2012  will  be  subject  to  the  criteria  set  out   in   this
           guidance....
           Applicants granted Discretionary Leave before 9 July 2012
           ( Those who, before 9 July 2012, have been granted  leave  under
           the DL policy in force at the time will normally continue to  be
           dealt with under that  policy  through  to  settlement  if  they
           qualify for it (normally after accruing 6 years continuous  DL).
           Further leave applications from those granted up to 3  years  DL
           before 9 July 2012 are subject to an active review.
           ( Consideration  of  all  further  leave  applications  will  be
           subject to a  criminality  check  and  the  application  of  the
           criminality thresholds, including in respect of cases awaiting a
           decision on a further period of DL on that date. See Criminality
           and Exclusion section above.
           (  Decision  makers  must  consider  whether  the  circumstances
           prevailing at the time of the original grant of  leave  continue
           at the date of the decision. If  the  circumstances  remain  the
           same and the criminality thresholds  do  not  apply,  a  further
           period of 3 years DL should normally be granted. Decision makers
           must consider whether  there  are  any  circumstances  that  may
           warrant
           departure from the standard period of leave."


14. The Appellant, being a  person  who  was  previously  granted  leave  to
   remain under this policy,  was  entitled  to  further  consideration  of
   extension applications by reference to that policy, so long as she could
   demonstrate that "the  circumstances  prevailing  at  the  time  of  the
   original grant of leave continue at the date of the  decision".  If  the
   Secretary of State failed to follow her own  policy,  the  appeal  would
   fall to be allowed as the underlying immigration  decision  was  not  in
   accordance with the law.


Decision on error of law


15. The first question that arose at  the  hearing  was  whether  the  Upper
   Tribunal should accede to the  Respondent's  application  to  admit  the
   minute  of  decision  making.  I  declined  to  do  so,  given  that  no
   satisfactory explanation was given for its late production: and in these
   circumstances, I accepted that Mr Mills was right to  concede  that  the
   First-tier Tribunal decision was flawed by having made a finding without
   evidential foundation whatsoever.
Decision on reconsideration of the appeal

16. As there was no requirement to entertain any further evidence  from  the
   Appellant's side, the parties agreed that, once the First-tier  Tribunal
   decision was set aside, the appropriate disposition of  the  appeal  was
   for the Upper Tribunal to proceed to determine the  matter  finally  for
   itself. Once again the admissibility of the decision minute fell  to  be
   confronted: I now considered it appropriate to admit the evidence of the
   basis for the DLR grant,  given  that  it  was  clearly  in  the  public
   interest that any entitlement to leave to remain should be determined on
   the basis of the true facts, particularly where a grant of leave appears
   to be inconsistent with judicial findings on the appeal made previously.
   The Appellant has had plenty of notice of the Home Office case  on  this
   issue given the previous adjournment of the appeal.

17. The minute of decision making now demonstrates beyond  reasonable  doubt
   the basis for the original  grant  of  DLR:  ie  that  the  Home  Office
   caseworker and their supervisor believed the original relationship  with
   her husband to still be extant. This dovetails with the Appellant's  own
   evidence  below  that  it  was  her  relationship  that   grounded   her
   application. The single reference to "private and family life",  in  the
   face  of  the  Appellant's  precarious  residence,  somewhat   chequered
   immigration history given the adverse  judicial  findings  made  in  her
   appeal, and limited connections with this country, cannot reasonably  be
   read as indicating that the scope of Article 8 rights thereby recognised
   extended beyond her relationship to her husband.  Accordingly it can  be
   seen that the condition precedent for a further extension of leave under
   the transitional arrangements, ie that "the circumstances prevailing  at
   the time of the original grant of leave continue  at  the  date  of  the
   decision", was simply not established.


18. The Respondent's decision was therefore consistent with her  policy  and
   the appeal falls to be dismissed.


          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law.
    Having reconsidered the appeal, however, the decision of the  Secretary
    of State was a perfectly lawful one.
    The appeal is dismissed.
