For the Respondent:    Mr Singh, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1. The Respondent is a national of Nigeria  who  was  born  on  11  November
   1970.  His appeal was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  S  Taylor
   in a decision promulgated on 6  September  2016.   The  Appellant  sought
   permission to appeal that decision and permission was granted  by  First-
   tier Tribunal Judge Robertson on 10 January 2017.  For ease of reference,
   I shall refer to the Appellant in this appeal as the Secretary  of  State
   and to the Respondent as the Claimant.


2. The Claimant made an application to remain in the United Kingdom  on  the
   basis of his family and private life.  He arrived in the  United  Kingdom
   on a student visa valid from 15 September 2009 until 28 January 2011.  He
   entered the UK on 12 October 2009 and was last granted leave to remain as
   a student from 9 March 2011 until 29 February 2012.  His application  was
   considered under the partner route by  the  Secretary  of  State  in  the
   reasons for refusal letter ("RFRL") dated 5 June 2015.  The Secretary  of
   State accepted that he had a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  a
   British partner who had lived in the United Kingdom all her life and  was
   employed  here.   It  was  not  accepted  however  that  there  were  any
   insurmountable obstacles to her relocation and the Secretary of State was
   not satisfied that she had in fact lived with the Claimant for two  years
   prior to the date  of  application.  The  Secretary  of  State  concluded
   therefore that the  Claimant  failed  to  meet  the  requirements  of  E-
   LTRP.1.7. of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  In view of  the  fact
   that the Secretary of State was not satisfied that EX.1  applied  to  the
   Claimant's case, the application was refused  under  the  partner  route.
   The application was also considered under the  private  life  route,  but
   refused on the length of residence requirements and also because  it  was
   not accepted that there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
   Claimant's integration into Nigeria.


3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge heard evidence from the  Claimant  and  his
   partner.  He concluded at paragraph 14 that in the light of the fact that
   the evidence of the parties was that they started  to  live  together  in
   June 2014, they were living together for less than a year at the date  of
   the application and therefore were unable to meet the requirements of the
   Rules with regard to unmarried partners.  He therefore concluded that the
   Claimant failed to meet the requirements of E-LTRP and  had  to  rely  on
   paragraph EX.1.  In considering EX.1 he concluded in  the  light  of  the
   fact that the sponsor was a UK citizen, had lived all her life in the  UK
   and had her own family  in  the  UK,  there  would  be  very  significant
   obstacles or very significant difficulties to continuing her family  life
   in Nigeria.  He concluded she would have to leave her job and face a very
   uncertain job market in Nigeria, and also leave her own family, including
   an adult daughter.  In the light of his findings he stated  at  paragraph
   16 that  he  was  satisfied  the  sponsor  would  face  very  significant
   difficulties if the parties were required to  live  outside  the  UK  and
   therefore met the requirements of paragraph EX.1, as defined by paragraph
   EX.2.


4. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal the  decision  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal in discrete terms, namely that there was  a  material
   misdirection of law, in the alternative in allowing the appeal under  the
   partner route, because if the Claimant  was  not  a  partner  within  the
   definition of a partner under GEN.1.2., then his claim  fell  outside  of
   the partner route and it  was  not  therefore  open  for  the  First-tier
   Tribunal to go on to consider his case under R-LTRP(d).   Permission  was
   granted on the grounds as  pleaded  because  it  was  arguable  that  the
   provisions of GEN.1.2. of Appendix FM paragraph EX.1 were  not  available
   via the R-LTRP.1.1  route  because  the  Claimant  did  not  satisfy  the
   definition of partner. Consequently,  according  to  the  case  of  Sabir
   (Appendix FM - EX.1 not freestanding) [2014] UKUT 00063 (IAC) the partner
   route was not available to him because, according to the  ratio  of  that
   case, it is plain from the architecture of the Rules as regards  partners
   that EX.1 is parasitic on the relevant Rule within Appendix FM.   It  was
   held that if  EX.1  was  intended  to  be  a  freestanding  element  some
   mechanism of identification would have been used and the structure of the
   Rule as presently drafted required it to be a component part of the leave
   granting Rule.  Consequently therefore, the grounds state that the  error
   was arguably  material  because  the  judge  in  his  assessment  focused
   entirely on whether there were insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life
   continuing in Nigeria and did not move on to a  proportionality  exercise
   and the provisions of Section 117 of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
   Asylum Act 2002 were not considered.


5. In a decision sent to the parties on 2 March 2017 I found that the First-
   tier Tribunal had made a material error of law. My core findings  are  at
   paragraphs 7 and 8 of the decision:


       "7.  It was clear on the  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
           paragraph  14  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  the
           Claimant did not meet the definition of partner in  GEN.1.2.  of
           Appendix  FM.  That  is  explicitly  stated,  and  it  is   then
           explicitly stated that the Claimant  has  to  satisfy  paragraph
           EX.1.  There was no reference by the First-tier Tribunal to  the
           authority of Sabir, the  ratio  of  which  I  set  out  earlier.
           Consequently,  since  the  Rules  require  that  the  two   year
           residence  period  must  have  elapsed  at  the  date   of   the
           application, and in the finding of the Judge that  it  had  not,
           due to the absence of cohabitation the  Claimant  was  therefore
           barred from relying on EX.1.  The Claimant therefore  could  not
           satisfy the requirements of the partner route and the appeal was
           allowed under the partner route only.


       8.   The First-tier Tribunal did not conduct a freestanding Article 8
           assessment outside the Rules and no  proportionality  assessment
           was carried out, simply because the Judge  accepted  erroneously
           that  the  Claimant  met  the   requirements   of   the   Rules.
           Consequently, the error must  be  material  because  the  appeal
           could only be allowed outside the Rules, it not having been  the
           case that the Judge found that any  other  requirements  of  the
           Immigration Rules were met.   There  was  no  reference  to  the
           statutory requirements that the Tribunal is obliged to take into
           account under Section 117 of the 2002 Act."


   6. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and adjourned with
      directions for the remaking of the decision in the appeal.


The Re-making of the decision in the appeal

The Parties submissions

    7. Ms Praisoody chose not to call the Claimant  to  give  evidence.  She
       submitted that the nature of his wife's work would put her in  danger
       and it was unclear how long it would take to make an entry  clearance
       application. Living in Nigeria would cause her enormous difficulties.
       The Claimant satisfied the Rules and to force him to return  to  seek
       entry clearance was not necessary.


    8. Mr Singh submitted that the Claimant should return and make and entry
       clearance application.


Discussion


    9. The Secretary of State conceded in the RFRL that the Claimant and his
       British partner, Ms  Elizabeth  Ebhodaghe,  were  in  a  genuine  and
       subsisting  relationship.  However,   they   could   not   meet   the
       requirements of the Immigration Rules  because  they  had  not  lived
       together for two years at the date of the application.  The  Claimant
       now advances his case on the basis that  they  are  now  married  and
       therefore they are now partners for the purposes of  GEN.1.2  (i)  of
       the Immigration Rules. The Claimant's bundle  contains  the  marriage
       certificate at p1 and I accept that they are now married.


   10.  The Claimant's right of appeal  is  on  human  rights  grounds  only
       against the refusal of a human rights claim  under  the  Immigration,
       Nationality and Asylum Act 2002 (section 82 and 84). The jurisdiction
       of the Tribunal in relation to appeals on Article 8 grounds only  was
       considered in respect of visit visa cases and by analogy the approach
       here should be the same. In Kaur (visit appeals;  Article  8)  [2015]
       UKUT 00487 the Upper Tribunal held that the Article 8 decision on  an
       appeal cannot be made in a vacuum.  The starting-point  must  be  the
       state of the evidence about  the  appellant's  ability  to  meet  the
       requirements of the Immigration Rules.


   11. In addressing the questions in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27  I  accept  that
       the Claimant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with his  wife
       which amounts to family life for the purposes of Article 8. Mr  Singh
       did not seek to persuade me otherwise and the relationship  has  been
       accepted as genuine by the Secretary of State. It was accepted by the
       First-tier Tribunal that they have been living  together  since  June
       2014. I also find that the proposed  interference  is  of  sufficient
       gravity  to  engage  the  operation  of  Article  8  and   that   the
       interference is in  accordance  with  the  law  and  necessary  in  a
       democratic society. The remaining question is therefore  whether  the
       interference is proportionate to the legitimate public end sought  to
       be achieved.


   12. My starting point in terms of proportionality is whether the Claimant
       can satisfy the Immigration Rules. The Claimant could  not  meet  the
       requirements of the Immigration Rules at the date of application  for
       the reasons set out in my error of law decision. The Claimant is  now
       married and hence is now a partner for the purpose of the Immigration
       Rules which is clearly relevant to an assessment of  proportionality.
       The requirements for limited leave to remain as a partner are set out
       at  R-LTRP.  They  require  the  satisfaction  of   the   suitability
       requirements  and  the   eligibility   requirements   which   include
       relationship requirements; immigration status requirements, financial
       requirements and English language requirements. It is  not  in  issue
       that the Claimant satisfies the relationship requirements. He  cannot
       satisfy the immigration status requirements because he is in  the  UK
       in breach of immigration laws (E-ETRP.2.2 (b)). This  means  that  in
       order to succeed he must show that EX.1 applies.


   13. Paragraph EX.1 applies if either of two conditions is satisfied.  The
       first applies to persons applying for leave to remain as parents, and
       is not relevant to the present appeal. The second applies to persons,
       such as the Claimant, who apply for leave to remain as partners:


 "(b) the applicant has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
       partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled in the  UK
       or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and there
       are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  that  partner
       continuing outside the UK."


   14. Paragraph EX.2 provides:


 "For the purposes of paragraph EX.1(b)  'insurmountable  obstacles'  means
       the very  significant  difficulties  which  would  be  faced  by  the
       applicant or their partner in continuing their family  life  together
       outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would  entail  very
       serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."


   15. This question must be determined in the light of the  guidance  given
       by the Supreme Court in R (on the  application  of  Agyarko)  v  SSHD
       [2017] UKSC 11.  The First-tier Tribunal in  determining  the  appeal
       did not  have  the  benefit  of  this  decision.  The  Supreme  Court
       determined  how  the  "insurmountable   obstacles"   requirement   in
       paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM was to be interpreted  albeit  prior
       to the 2014  changes  to  the  Rules.  Lord  Reed,  giving  the  lead
       Judgment, stated at paragraphs 43 and 44:


 "43. It appears that the European court intends the words  "insurmountable
       obstacles" to be understood  in  a  practical  and  realistic  sense,
       rather than as referring solely to obstacles which make it  literally
       impossible for the family to live together in the country  of  origin
       of the non-national concerned. In some  cases,  the  court  has  used
       other expressions which make that clearer: for example, referring  to
       "un obstacle majeur" (Sen v The Netherlands (2003) 36  EHRR  7,  para
       40), or to  "major  impediments"  (Tuquabo-Tekle  v  The  Netherlands
       [2006] 1 FLR 798, para  48),  or  to  "the  test  of  'insurmountable
       obstacles' or 'major impediments'" (IAA v United  Kingdom  (2016)  62
       EHRR SE 19, paras 40 and 44), or asking  itself  whether  the  family
       could "realistically" be expected to move (Sezen  v  The  Netherlands
       (2006) 43 EHRR 30, para 47). "Insurmountable obstacles" is,  however,
       the expression  employed  by  the  Grand  Chamber;  and  the  court's
       application of it indicates that it is a stringent test. In Jeunesse,
       for example, there were said to be no insurmountable obstacles to the
       relocation of the family to  Suriname,  although  the  children,  the
       eldest of whom was at secondary school, were Dutch nationals who  had
       lived there all their lives, had never visited  Suriname,  and  would
       experience  a  degree  of  hardship  if  forced  to  move,  and   the
       applicant's partner was in full-time employment in  the  Netherlands:
       see paras 117 and 119.


 44.  Domestically, the expression "insurmountable  obstacles"  appears  in
       paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM to the Rules. As explained  in  para
       15 above, that paragraph applies in  cases  where  an  applicant  for
       leave to remain under the partner route is in the  UK  in  breach  of
       immigration laws, and requires that there  should  be  insurmountable
       obstacles to family life with that partner continuing outside the UK.
       The expression "insurmountable obstacles" is now defined by paragraph
       EX.2 as meaning "very significant difficulties which would  be  faced
       by the applicant or their partner in  continuing  their  family  life
       together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or  would
       entail very serious hardship for the  applicant  or  their  partner."
       That definition appears to me to be consistent with the meaning which
       can be derived from the Strasbourg case law. As explained in para  16
       above, paragraph EX.2 was not introduced until after the dates of the
       decisions in the present  cases.  Prior  to  the  insertion  of  that
       definition,  it  would   nevertheless   be   reasonable   to   infer,
       consistently with the Secretary of  State's  statutory  duty  to  act
       compatibly with Convention rights, that the expression  was  intended
       to bear the same meaning in the Rules as in the Strasbourg  case  law
       from which it was derived. I would therefore interpret it as  bearing
       the same meaning as is now set out in paragraph EX.2."


   16. Much of Mrs Ebhodaghe's witness statement is taken up,  surprisingly,
       with submissions on the law. However, her reasons for  claiming  that
       there would be insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  in
       Nigeria are that she is a senior manager with  a  charity  supporting
       women fleeing domestic violence and that it would be  impossible  for
       her to obtain this type of work in Nigeria. Further, the Claimant  is
       from an area where the FCO advises against all but essential  travel.
       She also relies on the fact  that  all  her  family  are  in  the  UK
       including her grandmother and her daughter who is at university.  The
       Claimant states in his witness statement that the fertility treatment
       which the couple are undergoing here could not be pursued in Nigeria.
       He further refers to a high threat of terrorism in Nigeria  and  that
       going to Church as Christians would be difficult for them both.


   17. The First-tier Tribunal found that the sponsor had no connections  to
       Nigeria and had never been there. He did not  make  any  findings  in
       relation to the availability of fertility treatment  in  Nigeria  and
       there is no supporting  evidence  of  treatment  in  Nigeria  in  the
       Claimant's bundle before me nor does there appear to  have  been  any
       before the First-tier Tribunal. He accepted that the sponsor was in a
       managerial job, earning significantly above the national average  and
       not in profession that was transferrable across national borders.  He
       found that she  would  face  an  uncertain  job  market  in  Nigeria,
       although there does not have been any supporting evidence in relation
       to this. He also found that she would have to leave  her  own  family
       although her daughter was an adult and therefore he  considered  that
       this would not be a prime consideration. He accepted that the sponsor
       would face very significant difficulties if she was required to  live
       outside the  UK  and  accepted  that  this  met  the  requirement  of
       paragraph EX.2.


   18. The Secretary of State has  not  challenged  these  findings  in  all
       probability because it was her case that EX.1 should  not  have  been
       considered in any event as  the  Claimant's  case  fell  outside  the
       Immigration Rules. The First-tier Tribunal Judge also  did  not  have
       the benefit of the Supreme Court  decision  in  Agyarko.  However,  I
       accept his findings in relation to Mrs Ebhodaghe's family  here,  the
       fact that she would have to leave her job and would in all likelihood
       have difficulties finding a job in the same area of work. However, it
       is clear from the Court's decision in Agyarko, in which European  law
       on the question of  what  constitutes  insurmountable  obstacles  was
       considered, that the loss the applicant's partner's  employment,  the
       fact that the partner may never have visited  the  country  to  which
       they were to establish family life are not sufficient to satisfy  the
       requisite test. Further, the Supreme Court also held that  there  was
       no basis for interfering with the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in
       the linked appeal of Mrs Ikuga which held  that  the  "insurmountable
       obstacles" within the meaning of paragraph EX.1(b),  put  forward  on
       her behalf "could not possibly persuade any decision-maker that there
       were insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in  Nigeria".
       The fact that Ms Ikuga's partner would have to change jobs was not an
       insurmountable  obstacle;  nor  was  Ms  Ikuga's  wish  to   continue
       fertility treatment in the UK.


   19. The Claimant also argues that it would be unsafe for the  sponsor  to
       live in Nigeria in view of the risk of kidnap and crime. This is  not
       a matter in  respect  of  which  the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  any
       findings. According to the Claimant's witness  statement  his  family
       live in Edo State and his  parent's  house  was  broken  into  before
       Christmas. He says this is where they would have to stay and that  he
       feels that he could not safeguard his wife adequately.  There was  no
       evidence in the Claimant's bundle in regard to the  issue  of  safety
       but evidence was attached to the Claimant's grounds of appeal which I
       therefore consider. The Claimant claims to be from Edo State and  has
       produced the FCO advice to British Citizens for June  2015  regarding
       travel to Nigeria. Whilst this is not current, it is all I have  been
       provided with. Edo State is not one  which  the  FCO  either  advised
       against all travel or all but essential travel in  2015.  The  advice
       for that area is to see the FCO travel advice before travelling.  The
       advice says generally that there is a high risk of kidnaps throughout
       Nigeria and a high threat from terrorism.


   20. I accept that all of these factors would amount to  hardship  and  it
       would be difficult for  his  wife  to  adjust  to  life  in  Nigeria.
       However, there has been no suggestion that the Claimant and his  wife
       would not have anywhere to live in Nigeria or that he would be unable
       to work on return there. The test in EX.2  has  been  held  to  be  a
       stringent one and applying the case law to the facts of this  case  I
       find that it has not been met. There is no evidence before me to show
       that the FCO currently advise against travel to the  Claimant's  area
       of Nigeria and I do not accept that  the  Claimant  has  demonstrated
       very significant difficulties which would entail very severe hardship
       either for himself or his wife in living in Nigeria.


   21.  The Claimant also argues that were he to apply for  entry  clearance
       now he would be successful because he meets the requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules as a partner.   He therefore argues that  it  would
       be  disproportionate  to  remove  him  and  that  it  would  not   be
       proportionate for him to return to Nigeria to seek  entry  clearance.
       The requirements for entry clearance as a partner are set out at EC-P
       of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. The Secretary of State  does
       not dispute that  he  would  meet  the  relationship  or  suitability
       requirements. Mr Singh also did not seek to argue that he  would  not
       meet the financial requirements  on  the  evidence  provided  in  the
       Claimant's bundle. The  Claimant  has  produced  a  letter  dated  15
       February 2017 confirming that she has been appointed to the  post  of
       Service Manager at the Brent, Barking  and  Dagenham  Domestic  Abuse
       Service following her completion of her 9 month  review  period.  Her
       salary is said to be �36,348 per annum. She has produced  wage  slips
       for November 2016 to February  2017  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  bundle
       showing a monthly net payment of �2,255.  Her  wages  slips  for  the
       period March 2016 to 28 July 2016 are in the First-tier  bundle.  Her
       wage slips for August to October 2016 are not in either  bundle.  Her
       bank statements in the Upper Tribunal bundle cover the period from  8
       October 2016 to 6 March 2017 showing her income arriving in her  bank
       account. She has also produced her annual tax summary  for  the  year
       2015 to 2016 showing that her taxable  income  for  that  period  was
       �34,902.  Her contract of employment is at page 22 of the  First-tier
       bundle.


   22. The Immigration Rules  in  relation  to  specified  evidence  are  at
       Appendix FM-SE and require, in the case of salaried employment,  that
       an applicant must produce payslips for a period of 6 months prior  to
       the date of the application; a letter from the  employer  who  issued
       the payslips confirming the salary; the length of the employment; the
       period they were paid the level of salary relied on and the  type  of
       employment. Additionally personal bank  statements  corresponding  to
       the same period must be provided. The evidence must be submitted with
       the application  and  dated  no  earlier  than  28  days  before  the
       application. The Claimant could  not  satisfy  the  requirements  for
       specified evidence because it was not submitted with the  application
       in 2015. Further, even considering the position at the  date  of  the
       hearing the payslips do not cover six months prior to the hearing.


   23. However, notwithstanding that the formal requirements of Appendix FM-
       SE cannot be met, in my judgment the  evidence  clearly  demonstrates
       that  the  Claimant's  wife  earns  in  excess  of  the   maintenance
       requirements set  by  the  Rules  of  �18,600.  There  is  sufficient
       evidence to show that she earns �36,348, as claimed. As  the  Supreme
       Court remarked at paragraph  76  of  R  (on  the  application  of  MM
       (Lebanon)) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
       [2017] UKSC 10 when discussing the margin of appreciation accorded by
       Strasbourg to the national courts:


 "The tribunal is entitled to see a difference  in  principle  between  the
       underlying public interest considerations, as set by the Secretary of
       State with the approval of Parliament, and the working  out  of  that
       policy  through  the  detailed  machinery  of  the  rules   and   its
       application to individual cases. The former naturally include  issues
       such as the seriousness of levels of offending sufficient to  require
       deportation in the public interest (Hesham  Ali,  para  46).  Similar
       considerations would apply  to  rules  reflecting  the  Secretary  of
       State's assessment of levels of income required to avoid a burden  on
       public resources, informed as it is by the  specialist  expertise  of
       the Migration Advisory Committee. By contrast rules as to the quality
       of evidence necessary to satisfy that test in a particular case  are,
       as the committee acknowledged, matters of  practicality  rather  than
       principle; and as such matters on which the tribunal may more readily
       draw on its own experience and expertise."


   24. The fact that the Claimant meets the requirements of the  Rules  save
       for the immigration status requirement is  clearly  relevant  to  the
       balancing exercise. I have concluded that there are no insurmountable
       obstacles for the purposes of the Immigration Rules in the Claimant's
       spouse continuing family life in Nigeria. I now also address,  having
       regard to all the factors relevant to the balancing exercise, whether
       the Claimant's removal would be proportionate.


   25. Sections 117A and 117B are found in part 5A of the 2002 Act and apply
       in all cases where a court  or  tribunal  is  required  to  determine
       whether a  decision  made  under  the  Immigration  Acts  breaches  a
       person's rights under Article 8.


 Section 117A is as follows:

          (1) This Part applies where a court or  tribunal  is  required  to
          determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

             (a) breaches a person's  right  to  respect  for  private  and
             family life under Article 8, and

             (b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human
             Rights Act 1998.

          (2) In considering the public  interest  question,  the  court  or
          tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

             (a) in all cases, to  the  considerations  listed  in  section
             117B, and

             (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign  criminals,
             to the considerations listed in section 117C.

          (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest  question"  means  the
          question of whether an  interference  with  a  person's  right  to
          respect for private and family life  is  justified  under  Article
          8(2).


   26. The considerations referred to in section 117A(2)(a), which are  said
       by that provision to be applicable in  all  cases  where  the  public
       interest question is under consideration, are as follows:

           (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is  in  the
          public interest.

          (2) It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
          interests of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that
          persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
          to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

          (3) It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
          interests of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that
          persons who seek to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
          financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

          (4) Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

          (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
          a person at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
          precarious.


   27. The Claimant entered the UK on 12 October 2009 and was  last  granted
       leave as a student valid from 9 March 2011 until  29  February  2012.
       According to Mrs Ebhodaghe, she met him in April 2014 at which  point
       he had applied for a residence card on the basis  of  a  relationship
       with an EEA national. She says he thought he had the right to  reside
       in the UK as a matter of European law. He, however, does not  comment
       on this in his witness statement. In any event, it is clear that  the
       relationship with his wife, a  qualifying  partner,  was  established
       whilst he was here unlawfully. Even though he may have been trying to
       obtain a right of residence, he had no leave to remain and  that  was
       clear to both parties. I am required to give the relationship  little
       weight. I have born in mind also what the Mr  Justice  McCloskey  has
       recently said in the case of Kaur (children's best interests / public
       interest interface) [2017] UKUT 00014 (IAC), namely that the  "little
       weight" provisions in Part 5A of  the  2002  Act  do  not  entail  an
       absolute, rigid measurement or concept; "little  weight"  involves  a
       spectrum which, within its self-contained boundaries, will result  in
       the measurement of the quantum of weight  considered  appropriate  in
       the fact sensitive context of every case.


   28. In relation to the weight to be accorded to their relationship within
       the spectrum referred to above, I  accept  that  the  fact  that  the
       couple are attempting  to  have  children  together  and  have  lived
       together since 2014 shows that they are in a committed  relationship.
       In relation to the other factors  required  to  be  considered  under
       s117B, the Claimant can obtain no positive right to a grant of  leave
       to remain from either s117B  (2)  or  (3),  whatever  the  degree  of
       fluency in English, or the strength of  his  financial  resources  as
       these are neutral factors (Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803). In Rhuppiah
       the Court  of  Appeal  held  at  paragraph  63  that  the  expression
       'financially independent' should be given its natural meaning  of  as
       indicating someone who is  financially  independent  of  others.  The
       Claimant is dependent on his wife and for the purposes  of  s117B  is
       not financially independent although it cannot be said that  he  will
       be a burden on the state as he meets the  financial  requirements  of
       the Immigration Rules. He speaks English.  I also take account of the
       fact that the maintenance of immigration control  is  in  the  public
       interest.


   29. In Agyarko Lord Reed  concluded  that  exceptional  circumstances  in
       European case law means that, in cases  involving  precarious  family
       life, "something very compelling ...  is  required  to  outweigh  the
       public interest", and stated at paragraph 57 that:


 "57. That approach is  also  appropriate  when  a  court  or  tribunal  is
       considering whether a refusal of leave to remain is  compatible  with
       article 8 in the context of precarious family  life.  Ultimately,  it
       has to decide whether the refusal is proportionate in the  particular
       case before it, balancing the strength of the public interest in  the
       removal of the person in question against the impact on  private  and
       family life. In doing so, it should give appropriate  weight  to  the
       Secretary  of  State's  policy,  expressed  in  the  Rules  and   the
       Instructions, that the public interest in immigration control can  be
       outweighed, when considering  an  application  for  leave  to  remain
       brought by a person in the UK in breach  of  immigration  laws,  only
       where  there   are   "insurmountable   obstacles"   or   "exceptional
       circumstances" as defined. It must also consider all factors relevant
       to the specific case in  question,  including,  where  relevant,  the
       matters discussed in paras  51-52  above.  The  critical  issue  will
       generally be whether, giving due weight to the strength of the public
       interest in the removal of the person in  the  case  before  it,  the
       article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it. In general, in
       cases concerned  with  precarious  family  life,  a  very  strong  or
       compelling claim is required  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
       immigration control.


   30. The Claimant has remained in the UK in  breach  of  immigration  laws
       since 2012, established his relationship here whilst his  status  was
       precarious and does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  EX.2.  I  have
       considered all the factors relevant to the question of whether family
       life could be continued in Nigeria in my assessment  of  whether  the
       Claimant meets EX.2 and I do not consider that there are any  further
       factors which require consideration in this  regard  which  have  not
       been dealt with under the Rules.


   31. In view, however, of my finding that, but for the immigration  status
       requirement, the Claimant would meet the requirements of the Rules, I
       have considered whether it would be proportionate for the Claimant to
       return to Nigeria  to  seek  entry  clearance.  If  an  applicant  is
       otherwise certain to be granted  leave  to  enter,  at  least  if  an
       application were made from outside the UK, there  may  be  no  public
       interest in his or her removal (Chikwamba v Secretary  of  State  for
       the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40).


   32. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v Hayat;  Secretary  of
       State for the Home Department v Treebhowan  (Mauritius)  [2012]  EWCA
       Civ 1054  Elias  LJ  summarised  the  effect  of  Chikwamba  and  the
       subsequent decisions of the Court of Appeal in  TG  (Central  African
       Republic)[2008] EWCA Civ 997 and SZ (Zimbabwe) [2009]  EWCA  Civ  590
       and MA (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA Civ 953:


       a) Where an applicant  who  does  not  have  lawful  entry  clearance
          pursues an Article 8 claim,  a  dismissal  of  the  claim  on  the
          procedural ground that the  policy  requires  that  the  applicant
          should have made the application from his home state may (but  not
          necessarily will) constitute a disruption  of  family  or  private
          life sufficient to engage Article 8, particularly  where  children
          are adversely affected.


       b) Where  Article  8  is  engaged,  it  will  be  a  disproportionate
          interference with family or private life to enforce such a  policy
          unless, to use the language of Sullivan LJ, there  is  a  sensible
          reason for doing so.


       c) Whether it is sensible to enforce that policy will necessarily  be
          fact sensitive; Lord Brown identified certain potentially relevant
          factors in Chikwamba. They will include the prospective length and
          degree of disruption of family life and whether other  members  of
          the family are settled in the UK.


       d) Where Article 8 is engaged and there is  no  sensible  reason  for
          enforcing the policy, the  decision  maker  should  determine  the
          Article 8 claim on its substantive merits, having  regard  to  all
          material factors, notwithstanding that the applicant has no lawful
          entry clearance.


       e) It will be a very rare case where it is appropriate for the  Court
          of  Appeal,  having  concluded   that   a   lower   tribunal   has
          disproportionately interfered with Article 8 rights  in  enforcing
          the policy, to make the substantive Article 8 decision for itself.
           Chikwamba was such an  exceptional  case.   Logically  the  court
          would have to be satisfied that there is only one proper answer to
          the Article 8 question before substituting its own finding on this
          factual question.


       f) Nothing in Chikwamba was intended to  alter  the  way  the  courts
          should approach substantive Article 8 issues as laid down in  such
          well known cases as Razgar and Huang.


       g) Although the cases do not say this in terms, in my judgment if the
          Secretary of State  has  no  sensible  reason  for  requiring  the
          application to be made from the home state, the fact that  he  has
          failed to do so should not thereafter  carry  any  weight  in  the
          substantive Article 8 balancing exercise.


33. There is no evidence before me  as  to  the  period  of  time  an  entry
    clearance application would be determined. Article 8 is engaged and  the
    Claimant and his wife enjoy family life. In view of the fact that at the
    date of the hearing all of the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    save for the immigration status requirement are  satisfied,  I  conclude
    that were the Claimant to apply for  entry  clearance  that  application
    would be granted. I was also not addressed in relation to any case  law.
    The Secretary of State has not, at this  hearing,  advanced  a  sensible
    reason why the Claimant should return to seek  entry  clearance  nor  is
    this a case where there is an appalling immigration history  such  as  R
    (Ekinci) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] Imm AR  15.
    As concluded by Lord Reed in Hesham Ali v Secretary of State [2016] UKSC
    60, para 42, and R (on the application of Agyarko) v  SSHD  [2017]  UKSC
    11, para 42, the ultimate issue is  whether  a  fair  balance  has  been
    struck between individual  and  public  interests,  taking  account  the
    various factors identified. In the circumstances of this case, where the
    Claimant meets the requirements of the Rules save  for  the  immigration
    status requirement and no sensible  reason  has  been  put  forward  for
    requiring him to seek entry clearance I find that his removal  would  be
    disproportionate.


 Notice of Decision


Having set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  I  re-make  the
    decision in the appeal by allowing it on Article 8 grounds.


No anonymity direction is made.
