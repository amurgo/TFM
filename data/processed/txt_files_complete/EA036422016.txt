Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant is a citizen of  Ghana  born  30  July  1976  who  appeals
   against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  27  July  2016
   dismissing her appeal, itself brought against the Secretary  of  State's
   decision of 29 February 2016 to refuse her application for  a  residence
   card as the spouse of an EEA national exercising Treaty  Rights  in  the
   UK.


2. The history  provided  for  her  time  in  the  United  Kingdom  by  the
   Respondent is that she entered the United Kingdom some  years  ago.  She
   sought a residence card reflecting of  EEA  residence  rights  in  March
   2010, an application that was refused on 21 September  2010.  She  later
   sought entry as an EEA national's family member,  and  that  application
   was granted on 24 June 2013. She applied for a permanent residence  card
   based on retained residence rights on 24 September 2015.

3. Her application was for the recognition  of  residence  rights  retained
   following her marriage to Johan Gnaboua, a French citizen working in the
   UK, to whom she was married from 7 August 2009 until their divorce on  6
   August 2015. The application was refused because  it  was  not  accepted
   that Mr Gnaboua had been exercising Treaty Rights for  the  entirety  of
   their  marriage;  it  was  accepted  that  the  Appellant  was   herself
   economically active at the date of divorce.

4. The First-tier Tribunal accepted, on the basis of  documentary  evidence
   from HMRC and other sources, that  Mr  Gnaboua  had  worked  in  the  UK
   throughout the duration of the marriage, which was a  valid  one  during
   which they had cohabited for a significant period, and which had  lasted
   for more than three years. However it did not accept that the  Appellant
   was economically active as  at  the  date  of  the  hearing,  apparently
   because she had stated that she had been suspended from  her  employment
   because of  her  employer's  understanding  of  her  immigration  status
   following the refusal of the application leading to this appeal.

Findings and reasons


5. The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 provide:


      "'Family member who has retained the right of residence'
      10. (1) In these Regulations, "family  member  who  has  retained  the
      right of residence" means, subject to  paragraph  (8),  a  person  who
      satisfies the conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).
      ...
      (5) A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if-
      (a) he ceased to be a family member of a qualified person or of an EEA
      national with a permanent right of residence on the termination of the
      marriage or civil partnership of that person;
      (b) he was residing in the United Kingdom  in  accordance  with  these
      Regulations at the date of the termination;
      (c) he satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and
      (d) either-
      (i) prior to the initiation of the proceedings for the termination  of
      the  marriage  or  the  civil  partnership  the  marriage   or   civil
      partnership had lasted for at least three years and the parties to the
      marriage or civil partnership had resided in the United Kingdom for at
      least one year during its duration
      (6) The condition in this paragraph is that the person-
      (a) is not an EEA national but would, if he were an EEA national, be a
      worker, a self-employed  person  or  a  self-sufficient  person  under
      regulation 6; or
      (b) is the family member of a person who falls within paragraph (a)."


6. The sole issue upon which the appeal failed below was the  finding  that
   the Appellant was not active in an economic sense "if  he  were  an  EEA
   national" at the relevant time.  It seems  to  me  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal erred in law in taking this point, apparently  without  notice,
   against the Appellant, when the Respondent had expressly  accepted  this
   issue.


7. However, more significantly, in reality the payslips covering the period
   from  mid-2015  until  early  2016  from  the  Royal   London   Hospital
   established that the Appellant  was  working  for  them  throughout  the
   period  from  her  divorce  until  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal; at a relatively advanced stage of the  working  year  she  had
   earned ï¿½16,495. This is clearly a level of activity which is  meaningful
   and effective and thus constitutes relevant work  for  the  purposes  of
   European Union law.

          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law.
    The appeal is allowed.
