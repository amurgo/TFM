    JUDGE jordan:  This is the substantive consideration of an  application
    to judicially review the decision of the Secretary of State made  on  9
    March 2013 refusing the applicant's claim for leave to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom in order to pursue an  established  private  and  family
    life under Article 8 of the ECHR.

 2. The applicant is a citizen of Jamaica who  was  born  on  30  September
    1964. She is now 49 years old. She entered the United  Kingdom  in  May
    2001 as a visitor and has remained unlawfully ever since the expiration
    of her visit visa sometime towards the end of  2001.  On  24  September
    2011, she married her husband, Jonathan White, a British citizen. About
    12 months later, on 28 September 2012, by which time she  had  been  in
    the United Kingdom for over 11 years (none of which, save the first six
    months, was lawful presence) she applied for leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom under Article 8 on the basis of the family life that she
    had developed with her husband in the preceding 12 months.

 3. No attempt was made to make an application under the Immigration  Rules
    as a spouse. Accordingly, the application did not  address  the  formal
    requirements for entry clearance as a spouse, including  the  financial
    and maintenance requirements.

 4. On 9 March 2013 the application was refused. No removal directions were
    made at that time but the applicant was warned that, if she  failed  to
    leave, enforcement action would be taken. Subsequently, the  respondent
    was urged to issue removal directions providing her  with  a  right  of
    appeal under section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act,
    2002.

 5. The respondent's decision was prompted by an  application  made  on  28
    September 2012 supported by  15  groups  of  documents  including  bank
    statements from her husband, a letter  from  her  husband's  accountant
    showing that his business had  an  annual  turnover  of  �131,626  (and
    �60,000 for the next 2� month period) and a letter from HMRC.

 6. The letter under challenge makes reference to the applicant's spouse by
    reference to a consideration of Appendix FM and the requirements of  R-
    LTRP.1.1 that the applicant must have a valid application  for  limited
    or indefinite leave to remain as a partner and that the applicant  must
    have lawful presence in the United Kingdom but not as a visitor or with
    limited or with leave of six months or less or on temporary  admission.
    Accordingly, the fact that the applicant entered the United Kingdom  in
    May 2001 as a visitor effectively  precluded  her  from  meeting  these
    requirements.  Thereafter  the  decision  maker  went  on  to  consider
    paragraph 276ADE.

 7. This resulted in  setting  out  a  series  of  requirements  that  were
    immaterial for the applicant. It was not, of course, suggested that she
    had 20 years residence in the United Kingdom or that she was under  the
    age of 18 or that she was under the  age  of  25.  Nevertheless,  these
    considerations  were  considered  and  inevitably  rejected.  The  only
    material  part  of  paragraph  276ADE  related  to  sub-paragraph  (vi)
    applying to a person who was over 18 but had not lived continuously  in
    the United Kingdom for 20 years but who established she  had  no  ties,
    including  social,  cultural  or  family  ties,  with  Jamaica.   Quite
    properly, the decision maker reached the conclusion that,  having  been
    in the United Kingdom since May 2001 but  having  spent  the  first  37
    years of her life in Jamaica, the applicant failed  to  establish  that
    she had lost all ties there.

 8. That was the only consideration that was provided pursuant  to  Article
    8. There was no reference to whether the  particular  circumstances  of
    the applicant might amount to an exception to the  norm  in  accordance
    with the now established case law.

 9. I  do  not  consider  that  decisions  of  this  type  should  be  over
    prescriptive in their contents. If a  person  has  entered  the  United
    Kingdom as a visitor and has overstayed, there can  be  no  requirement
    that the decision maker has to go through the  process  of  considering
    whether there are exceptional circumstances when there are  none.  This
    is not a formulaic exercise. However, where as here, the decision maker
    focused on a series of matters which were largely irrelevant,  such  as
    the position of a person who is under 18 or between the ages of 18  and
    25 and treats the applicant's failure to  meet  those  requirements  as
    determinative, it is apparent that the decision does  not  engage  with
    the fact that there may be circumstances  beyond  those  considerations
    which a decision maker must acknowledge. It may only have required  the
    briefest of references but, in this case,  there  was  none.  For  this
    reason I consider that the decision of 9 March 2013  was  unlawful.  It
    follows that it should be set aside.

10. However, matters do not end there.  In accordance with directions  that
    were attached to the grant of permission, the respondent  was  required
    to serve a skeleton argument. Such a skeleton argument was served on 10
    September 2014. On the same day, the respondent  served  the  appellant
    with a further decision.

11. It was described in the following way:

         "...this letter is supplemental and should be read  in  conjunction
         with the original decision."

12. Mr Biggs submitted that  no  consideration  should  be  given  to  this
    letter. He submitted that it did not contain  an  acknowledgement  that
    the earlier decision was wrong and was withdrawn; he submitted  it  was
    not a new decision and was expressly stated to be supplemental. In such
    circumstances he submitted that it was unlawful in accordance with  the
    principles set out in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ermakov, R
    (on the application of) v Westminster [1995] EWCA Civ 42.

13. The issue that arose in Ermakov was whether the judge erred  in  having
    regard to reasons for the decision advanced by the Council's  principal
    homelessness  officer  in  an  affidavit  when   those   reasons   were
    fundamentally different from the reasons communicated to Mr Ermakov  in
    the Council's section 64 letter notifying him of their decision and the
    reasons for it.

13.  Reference was made to the classic statement of Lord Scarman in
    Westminster City Council v Great Portland Estates Plc [1985] 1 AC 661
    at 673:

        "Failure to give reasons. When a statute requires a public body  to
        give reasons for a decision, the  reasons  given  must  be  proper,
        adequate and intelligible. In In re Poyser and  Mills'  Arbitration
        [1964] 2 QB 467,  Megaw  J  had  to  consider  section  12  of  the
        Tribunals and Inquiries Act  1958  which  imposes  a  duty  upon  a
        tribunal to which the Act applies  or  any  minister  who  makes  a
        decision after the holding of a statutory inquiry to  give  reasons
        for their decision, if requested. Megaw J commented, at page 478:

           'Parliament provided that reasons shall be given, and in my view
           that must be read as meaning that proper, adequate reasons  must
           be given. The reasons that are set out  must  be  reasons  which
           will  not  only  be  intelligible,  but  which  deal  with   the
           substantial points that have been raised.'"

14.  Starting from that point of principle, the appellant in Ermakov  argued
    that it could not be right to admit, as justification of the  decision,
    this later evidence, since to do so would nullify the very objects  and
    advantages underlying  the  requirement  to  provide  reasons.  It  was
    conceded that evidence may be admitted to amplify the reasons given  in
    the decision letter, but the weight of authority was  against  allowing
    wholly deficient  statutory  reasons  to  be  made  good  by  affidavit
    evidence in the course of proceedings.  Hutchison LJ stated:

        "(2) The court can and, in appropriate cases, should admit evidence
        to elucidate or, exceptionally, correct or add to the reasons;  but
        should, consistently with  Steyn  LJ's  observations  in  ex  parte
        Graham, be very cautious about doing  so.  I  have  in  mind  cases
        where, for example, an error has  been  made  in  transcription  or
        expression, or a word or words inadvertently omitted, or where  the
        language used may be in some way lacking in clarity. These examples
        are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to  reflect  my  view
        that the function of such evidence should generally be  elucidation
        not  fundamental  alteration,   confirmation   not   contradiction.
        Certainly there seems to me to be  no  warrant  for  receiving  and
        relying on as validating the decision evidence - as in this case  -
        which indicates that the real reasons were  wholly  different  from
        the stated reasons. It is not in my view permissible to say, merely
        because the applicant does not feel  able  to  challenge  the  bona
        fides of the decision-maker's explanation as to the  real  reasons,
        that the applicant is therefore not prejudiced and the evidence  as
        to the real reasons can be relied upon. This is because,  first,  I
        do not accept  that  it  is  necessarily  the  case  that  in  that
        situation he is not prejudiced; and,  secondly,  because,  in  this
        class of case, I do not consider  that  it  is  necessary  for  the
        applicant to show prejudice before he can obtain relief. Section 64
        requires a decision and at the same time reasons; and if no reasons
        (which is the reality of a case such  as  the  present)  or  wholly
        deficient reasons are given, he is prima facie entitled to have the
        decision quashed as unlawful.

        (3) There are, I consider, good policy reasons why this  should  be
        so. The cases emphasise that the purpose of reasons  is  to  inform
        the parties why they have won or lost and  enable  them  to  assess
        whether they have any ground for challenging an  adverse  decision.
        To permit wholesale amendment or reversal of the stated reasons  is
        inimical to this purpose. Moreover, not only does  it  encourage  a
        sloppy approach  by  the  decision-maker,  but  it  gives  rise  to
        potential practical difficulties. In the present case it  was  not,
        but in many cases it might be,  suggested  that  the  alleged  true
        reasons  were  in  fact  second  thoughts  designed  to  remedy  an
        otherwise fatal error exposed by the judicial  review  proceedings.
        That would lead to applications to cross-examine and  possibly  for
        further discovery, both of which are, while permissible in judicial
        review proceedings, generally regarded as  inappropriate.  Hearings
        would be made longer and more expensive.

        (4) While it is true, as Schiemann J recognised in ex parte Shield,
        that judicial review is a discretionary remedy and that relief  may
        be refused in cases where, even though the ground of  challenge  is
        made good, it is clear that on reconsideration the  decision  would
        be the same, I agree with Rose J's comments in ex  parte  Carpenter
        that, in cases where the reasons stated in the decision letter have
        been shown to be manifestly flawed,  it  should  only  be  in  very
        exceptional cases that relief should be refused on the strength  of
        reasons adduced in evidence after the commencement of  proceedings.
        Accordingly, efforts to secure a discretionary refusal of relief by
        introducing evidence of true reasons significantly  different  from
        the stated reasons are unlikely to succeed."

14. The principles set out in Ermakov have no application  in  the  present
    case. They were directed towards the lawfulness of an earlier statutory
    decision. Such a decision cannot be remedied by what is said later.  In
    this case I have already made a finding that the decision of March 2013
    is unlawful. It was unlawful and remains unlawful and  will  always  be
    unlawful. Nothing that is said in the decision  of  10  September  2014
    alters the lawfulness of the earlier decision. Indeed,  the  very  fact
    that it was  thought  necessary  to  provide  another  letter  strongly
    suggests that the earlier  decision  was  deficient  and  required  the
    consideration of additional material.

15. The relevance of the letter of 10 September 2014 is  focused  upon  the
    remedy that the Tribunal affords when an earlier decision is  found  to
    be unlawful but is followed by a later decision. If the later  decision
    is a lawful consideration of all of the factors that the decision maker
    was required to consider but failed to consider in the earlier decision
    and omits consideration of all those factors that  the  decision  maker
    was required to omit, the later decision will be  a  lawful  one.  This
    does not alter the status of the earlier decision. As  I  said  in  the
    course of  argument,  if  judicial  review  proceedings  are  commenced
    alleging that the relevant decision is unlawful, those proceedings will
    have been justified and their commencement  will  remain  justified  at
    least until  a  lawful  decision  is  made.  Hence,  the  applicant  is
    protected insofar as the costs are concerned until at least the  letter
    of 10 September 2014 was received. Thereafter, an applicant is entitled
    to a little time in which to consider the ramifications  of  the  later
    letter and to consider whether the judicial review  proceedings  should
    continue, to include, where appropriate, a suitable provision  for  the
    payment of costs. Thus protected, there is no prejudice suffered by the
    applicant from the Tribunal considering the subsequent letter providing
    that, in doing  so,  the  applicant  is  afforded  sufficient  time  to
    consider it and it is not unfair for the Tribunal to express its  views
    about its lawfulness.

16. This is a necessary corollary of its  determination  that  the  earlier
    decision was unlawful. If the earlier decision  is  quashed,  it  would
    normally be appropriate to direct that the respondent makes a fresh and
    lawful decision. If, however, a fresh and lawful decision  has  already
    been made, there is no point in  requiring  a  further  decision  which
    would,  of  necessity,  replicate  what  has  already   been   decided.
    Accordingly, it is necessary to look at the decision  of  10  September
    2014 in order to determine the appropriate remedy. If the  decision  of
    10 September 2014 merely replicates the error of the original decision,
    the respondent's position is advanced no farther  and  the  appropriate
    remedy is to direct that the respondent must make a  fresh  and  lawful
    decision.

17. Mr Biggs submitted that the  letter  of  10  September  2014  which  is
    expressed to be a supplemental decision and to be read  in  conjunction
    with the original decision did not amount to  a  decision  at  all  and
    should be disregarded as it sought to enlarge the decision of  9  March
    2013 which was impermissible on Ermakov grounds. For the reasons that I
    have given, this is not the function of the  subsequent  letter.  Since
    the letter of 9  March  2013  was  a  sustainable  disposition  of  the
    applicant's claims under those parts of  the  Immigration  Rules  there
    referred to,  there  was  no  reason  to  withdraw  that  part  of  the
    reasoning.  It  was  not  the  decision  maker's  application  of   the
    Immigration Rules that rendered the letter unlawful. Hence it does  not
    matter that the  earlier  decision  was  not  withdrawn  by  the  later
    decision. Nor does it matter  that  the  letter  was  expressed  to  be
    supplemental, as indeed it was.  There  is  no  doubt  that  it  was  a
    decision because it considered all the relevant material and  purported
    to reach a sustainable conclusion upon it.

18. Consideration of the letter of  10  September  2014  reveals  a  proper
    consideration of the applicant's claim arising from the fact  that  she
    married a British citizen on 24 September 2011 and that  there  are  no
    children of the marriage. Consideration was then given to  Appendix  FM
    and  in  particular  to  the  so-called  'partner  route'  leading   to
    settlement. As the applicant had been in breach of immigration laws  by
    overstaying for a period in excess of 11 years,  it  was  necessary  to
    establish her case fell within one of the exceptions contained  in  the
    Rules. Such an exception  would  apply  if  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to the  couple  continuing  their  relationship  outside  the
    United Kingdom. The letter records that the applicant  had  been  given
    the opportunity in the application form to  set  out  the  reasons  why
    there were insurmountable obstacles in her  husband  continuing  family
    and private life to together in Jamaica and she  did  not  do  so,  see
    6.12, page 42.  However,  the  decision  maker  acknowledged  that  the
    applicant's husband was self-employed with  a  business  in  the  hotel
    industry  and  there  was  nothing  to  show  those  skills  were   not
    transferable in Jamaica.

19. The applicant argued before me that it would be unduly harsh for him to
    give  up  his  business  in  the  United  Kingdom  which  generates   a
    considerable turnover in order to commence a speculative  existence  in
    Jamaica. I am not satisfied that the respondent's view that there  were
    no insurmountable obstacles was an  irrational  one.  However,  in  the
    circumstances of this case, it is immaterial whether there are, or  are
    not, insurmountable obstacles.

20. The reason for this is because the decision maker went on  to  consider
    the issue of the applicant returning to Jamaica to  pursue  an  out-of-
    country application for leave to enter as a spouse. The decision letter
    reads:

         "Your client has remained  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  11  years
         without leave to remain and is now married to  a  British  citizen.
         All the factors which are considered to be in your client's  favour
         had  been  carefully  considered  (such  as  the  length   of   her
         relationship with her husband and that he is  a  British  citizen),
         they are outweighed by other factors such  as  your  client's  poor
         immigration history, that the relationship  with  her  husband  was
         formed when her immigration status was known to be precarious,  and
         it would not be unreasonable or disproportionate to expect her  and
         her husband to go to Jamaica to continue their family  life  there.
         Nor, considering the same  factors  would  it  be  unreasonable  or
         disproportionate to expect your client to make an  application  for
         entry clearance as a spouse from Jamaica, if she  and  her  husband
         wish for her to return to the UK."

21.  This is unquestionably a lawful decision for  the  respondent  to  have
    made in accordance with the principles set  out  in  Chikwamba  v  SSHD
    [2008] UKHL 40 where the House of Lords, whilst making  it  plain  that
    the principle is not limited to  cases  where  children  are  involved,
    applies to all  cases  where  there  is  likely  to  be  a  significant
    interference with the family and private  lives  of  a  returnee  whose
    application for entry clearance will succeed. In SSHD v Treebhowan  and
    Hayat [2012] EWCA Civ  1054  overturning  Hayat  (nature  of  Chikwamba
    principle) Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  00444  (IAC),  the  principles  were
    summarised in these terms:

       "30. In my judgment, the effect of these decisions can be summarised
       as follows:

       a) Where an applicant who  does  not  have  lawful  entry  clearance
       pursues an Article  8  claim,  a  dismissal  of  the  claim  on  the
       procedural ground that the policy requires that the applicant should
       have  made  the  application  from  his  home  state  may  (but  not
       necessarily will) constitute a disruption of family or private  life
       sufficient to engage Article  8,  particularly  where  children  are
       adversely affected.

       b) Where Article  8  is  engaged,  it  will  be  a  disproportionate
       interference with family or private life to enforce  such  a  policy
       unless, to use the language of Sullivan  LJ,  there  is  a  sensible
       reason for doing so.

       c) Whether it is sensible to enforce that policy will necessarily be
       fact sensitive; Lord Brown identified certain  potentially  relevant
       factors in Chikwamba. They will include the prospective  length  and
       degree of disruption of family life and whether other members of the
       family are settled in the UK.

       d) Where Article 8 is engaged and there is no  sensible  reason  for
       enforcing the  policy,  the  decision  maker  should  determine  the
       Article 8 claim on its substantive  merits,  having  regard  to  all
       material factors, notwithstanding that the applicant has  no  lawful
       entry clearance.

       e) It will be a very rare case where it is appropriate for the Court
       of  Appeal,   having   concluded   that   a   lower   tribunal   has
       disproportionately interfered with Article 8 rights in enforcing the
       policy, to make the  substantive  Article  8  decision  for  itself.
       Chikwamba was such an exceptional case. Logically  the  court  would
       have to be satisfied that there is only one  proper  answer  to  the
       Article 8 question before  substituting  its  own  finding  on  this
       factual question.

       f) Nothing in Chikwamba was intended to alter  the  way  the  courts
       should approach substantive Article 8 issues as laid  down  in  such
       well known cases as Razgar and Huang.

       g) Although the cases do not say this in terms, in  my  judgment  if
       the Secretary of State has no  sensible  reason  for  requiring  the
       application to be made from the home state, the  fact  that  he  has
       failed to do so should  not  thereafter  carry  any  weight  in  the
       substantive Article 8 balancing exercise."

22.  Where an applicant has remained in  the  United  Kingdom  lawfully  and
    establishes that she meets the requirements of  the  immigration  rules
    for  entry  clearance  in  one  capacity   or   another   it   may   be
    disproportionate to require the applicant to return to the  country  of
    her nationality.   If, in the  case  of  a  person  with  an  exemplary
    immigration history, the consequences are likely to be losing  her  job
    in the United Kingdom, remaining and accommodating herself in a foreign
    country where conditions may be difficult and where she has established
    there is a prolonged wait for a decision and where the remaining spouse
    in the United Kingdom may have to give up his work to  look  after  the
    children, the disruption and cost will impose a disproportionate burden
    if the only public interest in requiring the applicant to suffer  those
    burdens is the bare requirement to make an out of  country  application
    which, on the evidence, is bound to succeed. The amour  propre  of  the
    respondent must give way to common sense. However, where  an  applicant
    has abused the immigration rules  and  has  formed  a  relationship  in
    circumstances conventionally described as being "precarious", there  is
    a sound reason for requiring the applicant to  make  an  out-of-country
    application as she  would  be  required  to  do  were  she  not  to  be
    unlawfully in the United Kingdom. If there  is  no  evidence  that  any
    undue hardship will be caused  by  exercising  this  option,  there  is
    little that can be said to be disproportionate. Furthermore, unless  an
    applicant has established that the requirements of entry clearance have
    been met, a  decision  that  removal  would  be  disproportionate  must
    inevitably factor  into  the  decision  the  recognition  that  it  was
    unnecessary to determine whether the rules  have  been  met,  which  is
    itself significant.

23.  Even if the reality of  the  applicant's  future  lies  in  the  United
    Kingdom, it was open to the  respondent  to  decide  that  it  was  not
    disproportionate to refuse the application for leave  to  remain  under
    Article 8 where there is a viable and reasonable option of returning to
    Jamaica to make a lawful application for entry clearance. There  is  no
    reason why the applicant cannot establish the maintenance  requirements
    of the immigration rules but, so far,  the  only  material  before  the
    decision maker and Tribunal was a letter from the husband's  accountant
    setting out the business turnover without reference to the  commitments
    of the business.

24.  Mr Biggs also sought to argue that the decision not  to  issue  removal
    directions was unlawful.  He  accepted  that  in  accordance  with  the
    decision in Daley Murdock v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 161, there is no  duty
    to issue removal directions at the same time as the refusal of leave to
    remain. However, he sought to argue  that,  as  soon  as  an  applicant
    expresses an intention to  the  respondent  not  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom, the respondent is then obliged to  issue  a  removal  decision
    because there is no longer any room for the respondent to  believe  the
    applicant will  depart  voluntarily.  This  is  simply  unarguable.  It
    imposes a duty upon the respondent where  none  exists  simply  at  the
    election of the applicant, irrespective of the discretion held  by  the
    respondent to decide the priority in which removal directions  will  be
    made in accordance with, where  applicable,  policies  which  determine
    priority.

25.  For these reasons, I consider that the decision of  10  September  2014
    adequately performs its function of making a  lawful  decision  on  the
    application for leave to remain outside the Immigration  Rules  and  on
    the basis of the applicant's private and family life. It is, therefore,
    unnecessary to require the respondent to make a further  decision.  The
    fact that this decision was only made at the time that the respondent's
    skeleton argument was filed is not a reason to disregard it.  Ms  Patel
    drew to my attention the circumstances in  R  (on  the  application  of
    Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 where the relevant hearing took place  on
    19 March 2013 and the  fresh  decision  was  made  to  18  March  2013,
    [paragraph 2]. Whilst each case must, of  course,  be  decided  on  its
    facts, an applicant will normally be protected by an  order  for  costs
    unless there is unfairness. No application was made for an  adjournment
    to take instructions on the letter of 10 September 2014 and there  has,
    of course, been a period of  about  a  week  in  which  to  take  these
    instructions prior to the hearing. Inevitably, an applicant should  not
    be ambushed  by  a  late-served  fresh  decision  which  addresses  the
    shortcomings in an earlier decision and, to that extent, remedies them,
    but the position can be safeguarded by an order for costs or, where one
    is made and found to be necessary, an application for an adjournment.

26.  Having quashed the order of 9 March 2013,  I  make  no  order  for  any
    further relief. Whilst,  technically,  this  permits  the  applicant  a
    further challenge to the decision of 10 September 2014,  the  practical
    consequences of this decision are that no such challenge has  a  viable
    prospect of success.

27.  The parties are permitted 7 days in which to make their submissions  as
    to the proper order for costs, such submissions  to  be  limited  to  2
    sides of A4. I have already expressed  my  provisional  view  that  the
    applicant is entitled to her costs at least until receipt of the letter
    of 10 September 2014.  Unless otherwise agreed, I shall make a  summary
    assessment on the papers.

28. I refuse Mr Biggs application for permission to appeal. For the reasons
    I have given, I do not consider that the Tribunal's reliance  upon  the
    respondent's decision of 10 September  2014  is  unlawful  when  it  is
    considered in the context of deciding the relief to which the applicant
    is entitled.~~~0~~~~
