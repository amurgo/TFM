                            DECISION AND REASONS



Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this  appeal  but
    in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in
    the First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge D Harris promulgated on
    2 May 2014 which dismissed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  but
    allowed the Appellants appeal under Article 8 .

Background

 3. The Appellants are a husband and wife and  their  three  children.  The
    first Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 13 October  2007  with
    Entry Clearance as a highly skilled migrant.  The  leave  was  extended
    until 24 December 2012. On 17 October 2012 an application was made  for
    indefinite leave to remain and this  was  refused  in  July  2013.  The
    decision was remitted back to the Respondent to consider s  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009  and  the  decision  was
    maintained and a refusal notice was issued  on  23  October  2013.  The
    application was considered by reference to  paragraph  245  CD  of  the
    Immigration Rules and refused the Appellants could  not  demonstrate  a
    five year period of continuous leave because there was  a  gap  in  the
    Appellants lawful leave between September 2009 and December  2009  when
    an application had been made and rejected as invalid as payment of  the
    fees had been declined by the Appellants bank. The application was also
    considered under paragraph 276ADE of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
    Appellants were found not to meet those requirements.

The Judge's Decision

 4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge D Harris ("the Judge") allowed the appeal under Article 8  having
    accepted that they could not meet the requirements of  the  rules.  The
    Judge found that the  first  and  second  Appellants  were  liable  and
    credible witnesses; he accepted that there was a gap  in  their  lawful
    residence and therefore they could not meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules;  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  conceded  that  it  was
    appropriate to look at the Appellants case under Article 8 as this  was
    one of the grounds of appeal and the Judge assessed  the  circumstances
    of the whole family and concluded that theirs was one of the rare cases
    where the family's  removal  was  not  proportionate  and  allowed  the
    appeal.

 5. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that  the  Judge  had  materially
    misdirected himself in finding that the circumstances  of  the  gap  in
    their lawful residence amounted to a near miss argument  and  that  his
    assessment under Article 8 was flawed. On 20 may 2014 Designated First-
    tier Tribunal Judge French  gave  permission  to  appeal  stating  both
    grounds were arguable.

 6. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Mc Vitie on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent that he relied on the grounds of appeal.

 7. On behalf of the Appellants Mr Izebizua relied on the bundle  that  was
    before the First-tier Judge.

Finding on Material Error

 8. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law.

 9. In relation to the first ground I am satisfied that the suggestion that
    the Judge misdirected himself and accepted what amounts to a near  miss
    argument mischaracterises what the Judge said in his decision. As  part
    of the overall assessment of the case the Judge heard  evidence  as  to
    how the brief gap occurred in the period of lawful residence.  Evidence
    was given that  an  application  had  been  rejected  due  to  the  non
    clearance of a �50 application fee out of a �1750  total  payment.  The
    Respondent accepted  there  was  nothing  to  suggest  that  the  first
    Appellant did not have sufficient funds in his bank at the time of  the
    application. A  further  application  had  been  rejected  because  the
    children had provided thumbprints instead of signatures.

10. The Judge acknowledged at paragraph 5 that the time for appealing those
    decisions had long passed. He properly directed himself at paragraph 24
    of the decision that  the  Rules  'do  not  accommodate  a  "near  miss
    scenario".  However  the  factual  background  that   underpinned   the
    Appellants life in the United Kingdom which included their  explanation
    as to how the gap in their lawful residence arose was simply one  of  a
    number of factors that the Judge was entitled to take into  account  in
    his assessment of the proportionality of the decsion  .I  am  satisfied
    that this approach was one that was open  to  the  Judge:  the  Supreme
    Court in Patel and other v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    [2013] UKSC 72 while in essence finding that  there  is  no  near  miss
    argument as such also held that all facts have to be taken into account
    and considered in context.

11. In relation to the challenge to the Judge's Article 8  assessment  this
    seems to me to be simply a disagreement with the weight the Judge  gave
    to the various factors underpinning their claim which the Judge set out
    in careful detail at paragraphs 22- 26 of his decision. The Judge  also
    took into account the relevant caselaw  (paragraph  25).  There  is  no
    suggestion that the decision was irrational or  perverse  or  that  any
    factor has been overlooked but the grounds  simply  disagree  with  the
    weight the Judge gave to the various pieces of evidence.

12. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read as  a
    whole set out findings that were sustainable and sufficiently  detailed
    and based on cogent reasoning.





CONCLUSION

13. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

14. The appeal is dismissed.



Signed                                                              Date 26
