Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms N Brissett (of counsel) instructed by Aden &
Company
     Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan (Home Office Presenting Officer)







                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

[1]  There are four protagonists in the framework of this appeal:

    (a)  Halima Jimale, a Somalian national, aged  68  years,  who  applied
         unsuccessfully for clearance to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
         dependent parent (hereinafter "the Appellant").

    (b)  Mrs Fadumo Mohamed, also a  Somalian  national,  daughter  of  the
         Appellant, aged 43 years (hereinafter "the sponsor").

     c) Mr Abdulkadir Elmi, also a Somalian national,  aged  46  years  and
        resident with indefinite leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
        (hereinafter "the financial supporter").


     d) The Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO"), who  refused  the  Appellant's
        application.


[2]  Following refusal of her entry  clearance  application,  the  Appellant
    appealed to the First-Tier Tribunal.  The  appeal  was  allowed,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 12th  July  2013.   The  Judge,  directing
    himself correctly in law, said the following:

         "With regards to maintenance ......   the requirement to show  that
         a person or persons can be maintained adequately  without  recourse
         to public funds has been a requirement of  the  Immigration  Rules.
         An applicant needs to show that resources available  will  meet  or
         exceed the relevant Income Support [rate] ...."


     This was followed by a specific finding:

         "Taking into account the income ....  for the sponsor and the third
         party support which I find to be credible  ....    I  am  satisfied
         that the combination of funds between the  sponsor  and  the  third
         party  would  provide  the  Appellant  with   her   weekly   needs.
         Furthermore, the amount of the sponsor alone is sufficient to cover
         part of what the Appellant requires with the exception of a  little
         bit of money to top it up which can be provided  by  Mr  Elmi  [the
         financial supporter]."


     The Judge then made two further  findings.   The  first  was  that  the
    Appellant would be residing rent free in the Council house occupied  by
    her daughter (the sponsor) and her children.  The second was that there
    would be no adverse impact on Council tax benefit, as  no  Council  tax
    was being paid.  Pursuant to these findings, the appeal was allowed.

[3]  Permission to appeal having been granted to the ECO, a hearing  in  the
    Upper Tribunal ensued, on 20th September  2013.   In  his  subsequently
    promulgated Determination [Appendix 1  hereto],  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Latter concluded that the Judge had erred in law. He  identified  three
    inter-related shortcomings in the first instance decision:

         "[12]    When setting out his reasons with regard to maintenance in
             [27] - [29], the  Judge  made  no  clear  findings  about  the
             sponsor's income at the date of decision or subsequently .....


         [13] I am also not satisfied that the Judge dealt  adequately  with
             the issue of the third party support from Mr Elmi .....


         [14] I am not satisfied in the circumstances of this case that [the
             Judge's description of Mr Elmi's evidence  as  forthright]  is
             sufficient to show that the issue of third party  support  has
             been properly considered or that the requirements of the Rules
             have been met."


     Accordingly, the decision of the First-Tier  Tribunal  was  set  aside.
     It was retained in the Upper Tribunal, with appropriate directions, and
     we proceeded to conduct  the  consequential  further  hearing  on  23rd
     October 2013.


[4]  With some gentle judicial prompting, the  issues  between  the  parties
    narrowed significantly as the hearing progressed.  This  culminated  in
    the  presentation  of  an  amended  schedule  of  relevant  income  and
    expenditure immediately after the hearing [Appendix  2  hereto].   This
    demonstrated weekly income totalling  �410.54  and  weekly  expenditure
    totalling �408.67.  In the income schedule, there were four components.
     Two of these were Child Tax Credit and Child Benefit.  The  third  was
    Income Support of �101.35 per week.  The fourth was the proposed "third
    party support" (from the financial supporter) of �100 per week.   These
    figures were agreed, subject of course to  satisfactory  proof  of  the
    latter.  The net position was, subject to the issue just mentioned,  an
    excess of income over expenditure by �1.87 per  week.   It  was  common
    case that this represented the Appellant's  case  at  its  zenith.   If
    this, in turn, were accepted by  this  Tribunal,  the  requirements  of
    financial self-sufficiency, including  the  willingness  and  financial
    capability of the financial supporter to make the necessary payments of
    �100 per week indefinitely, would be satisfied.

[5]  We are mindful that the period  on  which  this  Tribunal's  attentions
    must be focused is that immediately  preceding  and  encompassing  July
    2012, when the impugned decision of the ECO  was  made.   Both  parties
    were  agreed  that  the  determination  of  this  appeal  would   hinge
    critically  on  this  Tribunal's  assessment  of   the   strength   and
    credibility of the evidence of two  of  the  protagonists,  namely  the
    sponsor  and  the  financial  supporter.  Having  considered  all   the
    evidence, we make the following specific findings:

     (a) There is a clear bond of mutual  loyalty  and  support,  rooted  in
         family relationships and Somalian culture, uniting  the  Appellant,
         the sponsor and the financial supporter.

      (b)  Pursuant  to  (a),  the  financial  supporter  has  provided  not
         insignificant  financial  support  to  the  sponsor   on   previous
         occasions.

     (c) The sponsor and the financial supporter have been known to  and  in
         contact with each other during a period of some years.

     (d) The sponsor and the financial supporter arranged meetings  for  the
         specific purpose  of  ascertaining  the  extent  of  the  financial
         commitment which he could make to facilitate the proposal that  the
         Appellant would come to  the  United  Kingdom  and  live  with  her
         daughter's family.

     e) At the material time the financial supporter's  net  annual  income
        was around �22,400, translating to  �1,867  net  per  month.  These
        figures were not disputed.


     f) At the material time, the evidence  of  the  financial  supporter's
        income presented to the  ECO  demonstrated  an  average  income  of
        �1,940 net per month.

     g) The financial supporter has at all  material  times  worked  for  a
        security firm and his employment is  secure,  frequently  entailing
        overtime hours.

     h) The financial supporter has been in possession of a credit card for
        approximately 1 � years.

     i) The financial supporter stopped sending money to his parents around
        July 2012, when their circumstances changed significantly.

     j) The financial supporter lives  modestly.   He  neither  smokes  nor
        drinks. He is the permitted occupant of accommodation rented by his
        friend  and  he  has  modest  weekly   expenditure,   ,contributing
        approximately �120 per month for this facility since 2012.



[6]  Building on these discrete  findings,  we  further  find  that  at  all
    material times the financial supporter has been both willing  and  able
    to contribute �100 per week to facilitate the Appellant  residing  with
    the sponsor and her children in their household in the United  Kingdom.
    We find also that this willingness and commitment have at all  material
    times been of indefinite duration. Having subjected the evidence of the
    sponsor and the financial supporter to careful  scrutiny,  taking  into
    account all of the  earlier  evidence  assembled  from  time  to  time,
    including  that  recorded  in  the  Determination  of  the   First-Tier
    Tribunal, we make these findings accordingly.

[7]   The salient requirement in paragraph 319V of the Immigration Rules  is
    that the Appellant -

     "(iii)   .....   is financially  wholly  or  mainly  dependent  on  the
             relative who has limited leave to enter or remain as a refugee
             or  beneficiary  of  humanitarian  protection  in  the  United
             Kingdom; and

      iv) can, and will, be  accommodated  adequately,  together  with  any
          dependents, without recourse to public  funds,  in  accommodation
          which the sponsor owns or occupies exclusively; and


       v) can,  and  will,  be  maintained  adequately  together  with  any
          dependents, without recourse to public funds ......"

          [Our emphasis]
         Based on the findings which we have made, we conclude  that  these
    requirements are satisfied.



DECISION

[8]  Accordingly, based on findings and for reasons  which  differ  somewhat
    from those of the First-Tier Tribunal, we reach  the  same  conclusion.
    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside earlier.  We
    remake the decision by allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
    refusal of entry clearance as a dependent parent.

                             Dated:    29 October  2013







                                 APPENDIX 1

1.   This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer,  Nairobi,  against  a
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal issued on 12 July 2013 allowing  an
    appeal by Halima Jimale against the respondent's decision dated 6  July
    2012 refusing her entry clearance  as  a  dependent  parent.   In  this
    decision I will refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier
    Tribunal, Mrs Jimale as the appellant and the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    as the respondent.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen  of  Somalia  born  on  1  July  1945.   She
    applied for entry clearance on 18 June 2012 to join her  daughter,  the
    sponsor, as her dependent mother.  The respondent was not satisfied  on
    the evidence before him that the appellant was related to  the  sponsor
    as claimed or that her circumstances were as stated.  Further,  in  the
    light of the fact that the sponsor was unemployed  and  dependent  upon
    public funds, he was also not satisfied that she  could  be  maintained
    and accommodated adequately without recourse to public funds.  A  third
    party had offered to provide support of �100 a  week  but  it  was  the
    respondent's view that there was no indication that he was genuinely in
    a position to provide such support for  the  rest  of  the  appellant's
    life.

3.   At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  the  judge  accepted  in
    the light of DNA evidence that the appellant and sponsor  were  related
    as claimed and that the appellant was over 65 years old.  He found that
    there was satisfactory evidence of  adequate  accommodation.   He  then
    went on to consider the issue of maintenance.  On this issue he set out
    his findings as follows:

         "27. With regards to maintenance I find  that  the  case  of  Yarce
             (adequate maintenance: benefits) [2010] UKUT  00425  makes  it
             clear that the requirement to show that a  person  or  persons
             can be maintained adequately without recourse to public  funds
             has been a requirement of the immigration rules.  An applicant
             needs to show that a  person  or  persons  can  be  maintained
             adequately  without  recourse  to  public  funds  as  being  a
             requirement of the immigration rules.  An applicant  needs  to
             show that resources available will meet or exceed the relevant
             income support that was set by the UK government.  The case of
             KA (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT 0065 is relevant in this regard.


         28.  Taking into account the income coming in for the  sponsor  and
             the third party support which I find to be credible in view of
             the forthright evidence given by the appellant and Mr  Elmi  I
             am satisfied that the combination of funds between the sponsor
             and the third party  would  provide  the  appellant  with  her
             weekly needs.  Furthermore the amount of the sponsor alone  is
             sufficient to cover part of what the appellant  requires  with
             the exception of a little bit of money to top it up which  can
             be provided by Mr Elmi.


         29.  I accept the submissions made by Ms Brissett on the  issue  of
             maintenance.  There is no satisfactory evidence before me that
             the inclusion of the appellant into the sponsor's  home  would
             negate her council tax benefit as council tax  was  not  being
             paid in the first place.  Furthermore the appellant  will  not
             be paying any rent in the property.  If that is the case it is
             likely that such amount will be very minimal and can  be  paid
             out of the money provided by the third party."

4.   Accordingly, the judge found that the appellant  met  the  requirements
    of paragraph 319(v) of HC 395 as amended.

Grounds and Submissions

5.   The respondent applied for permission to appeal on the basis  that  the
    judge failed to make a finding  on  the  sponsor's  income  or  housing
    expenses and that it was impossible  to  discern  to  what  extent  the
    sponsor's income would be  sufficient  to  maintain  the  appellant  or
    whether third party support would be necessary.  It was further  argued
    that the judge had erred in accepting that the  offer  of  third  party
    support was genuine in the light of the fact that as  at  the  date  of
    decision he only had �1.15  in  his  bank  account  and  there  was  no
    evidence to show that he was in a position  to  offer  support  neither
    were any changes reasonably foreseeable.  His  evidence  was  that  his
    bank balance was low because he was sending money to his parents but he
    no longer needed to do so because they had now found employment.

6.   Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the
    following reasons:

         "... 2.  Within the application it is stated by the respondent that
                the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  made  an  arguable  material
                error  of  law  by  finding  that  there  will  be  adequate
                maintenance for the appellant's needs in the United Kingdom.
                 It appears to be accepted that the sponsor is in receipt of
                income support - she has three children  and  her  rent  and
                council tax are paid through public funds.


         3.   The addition of the appellant into her  household  would  mean
                that in order to provide 'adequate' maintenance the  sponsor
                would have to demonstrate an ability  to  provide  financial
                support for her mother out of her resources.   I  find  that
                she has not done so.  She has relied on the availability  of
                third party  support  but  there  is  insufficient  evidence
                before the First-tier Tribunal Judge that the  relative  who
                promised  third  party  support  had  sufficient   financial
                resources of his own noting that as at the date of  decision
                the credit balance in his bank account was only �1.15.


         4.   I am satisfied that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made  an
                arguable material error of law  in  his  assessment  of  the
                funds available or the appellant's maintenance and failed to
                apply the appropriate test in considering whether the  funds
                available were adequate for the appellant's needs."

7.   Mr Walker adopted the grounds.  He submitted that the judge had  failed
    to make any adequate findings about the  sponsor's  income  or  housing
    expenses and it was impossible to discern from  the  determination  how
    she would maintain the appellant without  further  recourse  to  public
    funds.  Secondly, he argued that the judge had erred in his  assessment
    of the evidence about third party  support.   He  had  failed  to  take
    proper account of the funds available as at the date  of  decision  and
    any change of  circumstances  arising  after  the  decision  could  not
    properly be regarded as reasonably foreseeable.

8.   Ms Brissett submitted that the judge had reached  a  decision  properly
    open to him when his conclusions were read in the light of  his  record
    of the evidence and  the  submissions.   When  calculating  the  income
    available to the sponsor, any public funding received was part  of  the
    overall assessment.  She referred  to  the  Tribunal  determination  in
    Ahmed (benefits; proof of receipt; evidence)  [2013]  UKUT  00084.  She
    submitted that on the  calculations  she  had  put  to  the  judge  the
    position was that the sponsor would need  to  show  an  income  for  an
    adult, a pensioner and three children of �330.37 whereas she  was  only
    able to show �280.19 and there was therefore a �50 per  week  shortfall
    but this was met by the offer of third party support  which  the  judge
    had accepted.  When asked about the judge's comment in  [22]  that  the
    appellant would only require �107.45 per week which is what someone  on
    a state pension would receive and that third party  support  would  not
    strictly be required as the amount of money the  sponsor  received  was
    sufficient to accommodate the needs save in  respect  of  an  extra  �7
    commented, Ms Brissett accepted that she was not  entirely  sure  where
    these figures came from.

9.   In reply Mr Walker pointed out that the sponsor  had  started  work  in
    March 2013 after the respondent's decision.  He argued that  the  judge
    had not properly carried out or explained his  assessment  of  how  the
    appellant was able to meet the financial requirements of the rules.

Assessment of the Issues

10.  The issue for me at this stage of the  hearing  is  whether  the  judge
    erred in point of law such that the decision should be set aside.  I am
    satisfied that he did for the following  reasons.   In  [7]  where  the
    judge sets out the evidence before him  he  records  that  the  sponsor
    confirmed that she received child tax credit of �8,220.36,  got  income
    support, and housing benefit to pay for her rent.  In  respect  of  the
    offer of third party support he recorded the sponsor as stating at [12]
    that her mother and the mother of Mr Elmi, who was offering third party
    support were cousins.  She had not asked him how long he would do  this
    for.  At the time of decision his bank statement  was  low,  a  lot  of
    money was being used but he would now  keep  his  expenses  down.   She
    explained that she received benefits at the date of  decision  but  had
    been able to send money to her mother.

11.  The evidence of Mr Elmi is set out at [15] - [16].   He  accepted  that
    his bank statement was low at the  date  of  decision  because  he  was
    sending a lot of money to his parents in Somalia.  However,  they  were
    now able to work themselves as they were in Djibouti  and  about  eight
    months previously he had stopped sending money to them.  He would  help
    the appellant for as long as needed.  He wanted to do  so  because  she
    was a relative and  his  religion  said  that  he  should  support  his
    relative.

12.  When setting out his reasons with regards  to  maintenance  in  [27]  -
    [29], the judge made no clear findings about the  sponsor's  income  at
    the date of decision or subsequently.  He simply said that in  view  of
    the forthright evidence given by her and Mr Elmi that  the  combination
    of funds between them would provide the appellant with her weekly needs
    [28].  He commented that the amount the sponsor had was  sufficient  to
    cover part of what the appellant required  with  the  exception  of  "a
    little bit of money to top it up" which could be provided  by  Mr  Elmi
    [22].  However, this finding is unexplained.  There is nothing  in  his
    summary of the evidence or his findings of fact to make it clear how he
    reached  this  conclusion.   The  only  recorded  evidence  about   the
    sponsor's finances is at [7] and [22].  Ms Brissett accepted that  what
    the judge said at [22] did not  provide  any  adequate  explanation  to
    support his findings.

13.  I am also not satisfied that the judge dealt adequately with the  issue
    of the third party support from Mr Elmi.  That had to be assessed as at
    the date of decision.  The judge appears to have accepted that he  then
    had obligations to his  own  parents  which  he  was  meeting  and  the
    inference from the evidence appears to be that he was now able to  look
    after the appellant  because  subsequently  his  own  parents  obtained
    employment and he no longer has to support them.

14.  Whilst evidence of third party support can properly  be  relied  on  to
    meet the maintenance requirements of the rules, a number of authorities
    have made it clear that this evidence needs to be analysed with care to
    ensure not only that an  offer  is  genuine  but  also  that  there  is
    sufficient evidence of intention and ability to meet what may be a long-
    term commitment (see for example AK and others (long term  third  party
    support) Bangladesh [2006] UKIAT 00069  and  KJ  (working  holidaymaker
    -third party support) [2011]  UKUT  00034).   The  judge  described  Mr
    Elmi's evidence as forthright but without more I am  not  satisfied  in
    the circumstances of this case that this  is  sufficient  to  show  the
    issue of third party support has been properly considered or  that  the
    requirements of the rules have been met.

15.  For these reasons I find that the judge erred in law in a  way  capable
    of affecting the outcome of the appeal  and  accordingly  the  decision
    should be set aside.  I heard submissions from both Mr  Walker  and  Ms
    Brissett.  I am satisfied that this is a case which  should  remain  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

16.  Permission is granted to call further evidence from the sponsor and  Mr
    Elmi on the issue of maintenance.  It would be helpful to have a  clear
    schedule of the sponsor's income as at the date of decision  and  after
    she started work.  Any such schedule and skeleton  argument  is  to  be
    filed seven days before the date of the resumed hearing on  23  October
    2013.
