                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Cary, promulgated on 18th September 2018, following a hearing at Taylor
    House on 7th September 2018.  In the decision, the judge dismissed  the
    appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Appellant  subsequently  applied
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of  India,  and  was  born  on  22nd
    January 1988.  He is presently 31 years of  age.   He  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom in February 2010, as a working holidaymaker, but did not
    leave at the end of his two year period of lawful stay.  He went on  to
    marry a lady by the name of [CP] ("Mrs [P]"), who is a British citizen.
     The Hindu marriage took place on 19th July 2015 and this was  followed
    by a civil marriage ceremony on 11th January 2016.   It  is  a  further
    feature of this  appeal  that,  like  Mrs  [P],  a  son  born  to  them
    subsequently, on 13th May 2017, is also a British citizen.

The Judge's Findings

 3. At the hearing before Judge Cary, only  Mrs  [P]  gave  evidence.   She
    stated that the Appellant stayed at home and looked  after  their  son,
    whereas she went to work as a care assistant  at  the  [~]  Care  Home,
    where she had been working since 2015, and she initially earned �19,000
    per annum but now  earned  �28,000  per  annum  gross.   In  a  lengthy
    decision, where the judge set out the relevant case law, he went on  to
    conclude that, it was not disputed that the Appellant was in a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship with his wife who  was  a  British  citizen
    (paragraph 32), but the main question here was whether there  would  be
    insurmountable obstacles to their family life  continuing  outside  the
    UK, were the Appellant to be required to return,  as  proposed  by  the
    Respondent Secretary of State.  The  judge  went  on  to  consider  the
    mitigating factors, including the medical evidence (paragraph 35),  and
    decided that the Appellant could not succeed.  Consideration  was  then
    given to Article 8 (paragraph 56) and it was concluded  that  it  would
    not be disproportionate to require the Appellant to return.

 4. Finally, the judge had regard to the child of  the  Appellant  and  Mrs
    [P], who was a British citizen, and the judge concluded that there  was
    nothing to suggest that Mrs [P] would not be able to  provide  her  son
    with safe and effective care without any input from  the  Appellant  or
    that his self-development would be impaired, were they to  come  to  an
    arrangement whereby she would stay in this country and he would have to
    return (paragraph 40).

 5. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. In prolix and cumbersome Grounds of Application, it  was  alleged  that
    the judge had erred in law in coming to the  conclusions  that  he  did
    because the judge should have considered old style Grounds  of  Appeal,
    amongst other things.  The Grounds of Application were rejected by  the
    First-tier Tribunal on 10th December 2018.

 7. In the  Upper  Tribunal,  it  was  held  on  25th  January  2019,  that
    disregarding the bulk of the grounds that had been raised, there arose,
    nevertheless, arguable grounds of appeal  in  three  respects.   First,
    consideration of the best interests of the child (at paragraph  40)  by
    the judge was relatively  brief,  and  did  not  consider  the  child's
    British citizenship or whether the best interests are to remain in  the
    United Kingdom or whether they could be met in India.  Secondly, it was
    arguable that  when  undertaking  the  proportionality  exercise  under
    Article 8, the Tribunal had  not  adequately  taken  into  account  the
    medical evidence in relation to the Appellant and  the  impact  of  the
    same on reintegration in India for himself and his family.  Third, that
    although not raised at all in the Grounds of Appeal, which were  lodged
    some time after the Supreme Court's decision  in  KO  (Nigeria)  [2018]
    UKSC 53, this was an obvious point that ought to have been  considered,
    when regard was had to Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act, such  that  the
    Tribunal had arguably proceeded on the wrong legal basis.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 3rd April 2019, Mr Jas Chhotu, appearing on
    behalf of the Appellant, handed up his lengthy skeleton  argument.   He
    submitted that he had taken the opportunity to speak with  Mr  McVeety,
    the Senior Home Office Presenting Officer, and it was agreed that there
    was an error of law in the  three  specific  respects  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal had indicated.  For his part, Mr McVeety also  submitted  that
    there was an error of law in the decision, but that in  remitting  this
    case back to the First-tier Tribunal, the positive findings  in  favour
    of the Appellant, such as the  fact  that  he  was  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with his wife, ought to be preserved.

 9. As regards the disposal of the appeal, Mr McVeety submitted that  there
    were a number of issues, such as whether the Appellant was at  risk  of
    ill-treatment from wider family  members,  which  may  require  further
    evidence, so that this Tribunal ought on that basis to remit this  case
    to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  so  that  any  new  evidence  could  be
    considered in relation to that.

Notice of Decision

10. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007), such that I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are  those  that  had  been  agreed  between  the
    parties.  They comprise the three specific issues raised,  of  its  own
    volition, by the Upper Tribunal, in granting permission on 25th January
    2019, which do require further consideration.  In particular, I  should
    add that the Immigration Directorate Instruction  -  Family  Migration,
    which has been interpreted by the Upper  Tribunal  in  SF  [2017]  UKUT
    00120, should be considered.  This makes clear in relation  to  Section
    117B of  the  2002  Act,  that  if  the  Appellant  is  not  liable  to
    deportation, then provided it is not reasonable to expect  the  British
    citizen child to leave the UK the Appellant succeeds in the appeal (see
    paragraphs 11 to 13).  In the same way, although  KO  (Nigeria)  [2018]
    UKSC 53 makes clear  that  whether  it  is  "reasonable  to  expect"  a
    qualifying child to leave the UK, the focus must  be  exclusively  upon
    the position of the child, the  immigration  status  of  a  parent  may
    nevertheless be relevant in assessing, "in the real world the impact  a
    parent's removal may have on a child's best interests", but  the  focus
    must be on the position of the child.  Subject to this, the findings in
    favour of the Appellant should be preserved intact  from  the  Tribunal
    below.  Insofar as any further evidence is to be called,  such  as  the
    risk to the Appellant from family  members,  this  should  be  properly
    raised below on due notice to the Respondent Secretary of State, if  it
    is to be pursued any further.

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  I set aside the decision of the original judge.   I
    remake the decision as follows.  This appeal is remitted  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal to be determined by a judge other than  Judge  Cary
    pursuant to Practice Statement 7.2(b) of the Practice Directions.

12. No anonymity direction is made.

13. This appeal is allowed.
