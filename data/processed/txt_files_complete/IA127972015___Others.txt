                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
                            DECISION AND REASONS
    1. On 30 November 2016 the Tribunal served a copy  of  the  "NOTICE  OF
       DECISION OF APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION  TO  APPEAL  AND  DIRECTIONS"
       that is appended hereto.
    2. Neither party has responded to those Directions.
    3. In the circumstances, and having regard to Rule 34 of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008,  I  have  decided  without  a
       hearing that there is  no  right  of  appeal  against  the  decision
       complained of. I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
       and I substitute  a  decision  that  there  is  no  jurisdiction  to
       entertain the appeal.

         NOTICE OF DECISION OF APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL
                               AND DIRECTIONS

It is unnecessary to hold an oral hearing of the application for  permission
to appeal because I consider that it can  be  dealt  with  properly  on  the
papers.

The application for permission to appeal is granted.
                                   REASONS
                 (Including any decision on extending time)
 1. These are appeals against the refusal to grant a residence  card  as  an
    extended family member. Following the decision of this Tribunal in  Sala
    (EFMs: Right of Appeal : Albania) [2016] UKUT 411 (IAC) it appears  that
    there is no right of appeal against the decision complained of.
 2. If that is the case then,  arguably,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should be set aside and replaced with a decision that there  is
    no right of appeal.
 3. The Appellants are and the Respondent is DIRECTED to notify the Tribunal
    within 14 days of the date on this Notice  if  it  is  agreed  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be  set  aside  and  replaced
    with a decision that there is no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal  OR
    explain, in outline, why there is a right of appeal.
 4. If a party does not respond to paragraph 3 of this Notice and Directions
    the Tribunal is likely to conclude that the defaulting party consents to
    the decision suggested.
