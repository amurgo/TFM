Representation:
For the Appellant (Secretary of State): Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office
                                        Presenting Officer
For the Respondent (Mr and Mrs Deshmukh):    Mr J Gajjar, Counsel,
                                        instructed by Direct Access


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Lucas.  For ease of reference, I  shall  throughout
    this decision refer to the Secretary of State,  who  was  the  original
    respondent, as "the Secretary of State" and to Mr and Mrs Deshmukh, who
    were the original appellants, as "the claimants" (and to Mr Deshmukh as
    "the first claimant").

 2. The first claimant is a national of India born on 29  June  1980.   The
    second claimant is his wife and her appeal stands or  falls  with  his.
    Accordingly I shall throughout this decision be referring to the  first
    claimant, and will not specifically make reference  to  his  wife,  the
    second claimant.

 3. The first claimant arrived in this country in September 2006 on a  Tier
    4 Student visa valid until 31 January  2008  and  his  leave  was  then
    variously extended until 26 June 2016.  All his applications were  made
    in time and at least on the face of them he accordingly had  permission
    to be in the UK which was obtained lawfully until on 16 September  2016
    he made the claim with which this Tribunal  is  now  concerned  on  the
    basis of ten years' lawful residence.

 4. In the course of making visa applications on 4 April  2011  he  made  a
    Tier 1 visa application in which he claimed  an  income  of  �55,408.61
    said to have been earned in the period from 27 March 2010 to  25  March
    2011.  This was said to be made up of �18,222.61 from  employed  income
    and �36,586 from self-employed income.  However it is now the case  (as
    is well  known  to  many  applicants  who  make  applications  now  for
    indefinite leave to remain) that when  applicants  apply  for  ILR  the
    Secretary of State  makes  enquiries  with  the  Revenue  in  order  to
    ascertain that there has been consistency between income  declared  for
    tax purposes in the past and income claimed when seeking  a  visa.   In
    this case on enquiries that the Secretary of State made it  turned  out
    that at the same time as he was claiming an income of �55,000  odd  for
    2010 to 2011, including a figure of �36,586 in  respect  of  his  self-
    employment, he only declared an income to HMRC of �5,620, which  as  is
    now accepted on his behalf is a very  significant  discrepancy  indeed.
    As is very common in cases of this kind, which  are  frequently  before
    this Tribunal (although more often in judicial review cases)  prior  to
    making the ILR application this applicant put  in  amended  figures  to
    HMRC following which he agreed to pay increased tax of  around  �14,000
    and also some interest.  It appears that he also had to amend  his  tax
    returns for the following year.  The HMRC did not impose any  penalties
    for this late correction, which is a matter  which  will  be  discussed
    below.

 5. Essentially because of this very significant discrepancy the  Secretary
    of State decided to refuse the claimant's application for  ILR  on  the
    basis  of  his  character  as  set  out  in  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules, the relevant part of which provides as follows:

         "Refusal of leave to remain, variation of leave to enter or  remain
         or curtailment of leave

         322. In addition to the grounds for refusal of  extension  of  stay
             ... the following provisions apply in relation to the  refusal
             of an application for leave to remain, variation of  leave  to
             enter or remain or,  where  appropriate,  the  curtailment  of
             leave ...

         Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter or
         remain in the United Kingdom should normally be refused ...

             (5)  the undesirability of permitting the person concerned  to
                  remain in the United Kingdom in the light of  his  conduct
                  (including convictions which do not fall within  paragraph
                  322(1C)), character or associations or the  fact  that  he
                  represents a threat to national security ..."

 6. In this case the Secretary of State in his refusal letter of 5 February
    2018 refused the application specifically on  the  basis  of  character
    under paragraph 322(5) of the Rules.

 7. It is common ground, as found by  this  Tribunal  in  particular  in  a
    number of cases that in order for a refusal to be justified on  grounds
    of character under paragraph 322(5) this must be justified  on  grounds
    of deliberate dishonesty by an applicant.  It is not sufficient for the
    Secretary of State to rely on a very bad mistake which  may  have  been
    made.  So far as this decision is concerned, were it  to  be  suggested
    that misconduct falling short of dishonesty would be  sufficient,  this
    Tribunal would have no hesitation in finding that it would not.

 8. The claimant appealed against this decision and his  appeal  was  heard
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Lucas, sitting at Taylor House  on  13
    November 2018.  I record that although the claimant was represented  at
    that hearing, for reasons which have not been given, but are presumably
    to regrettable lack of  resources,  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not
    represented at that hearing.  It would have  been  preferable  in  this
    case for the Secretary of State to have been represented, and I  record
    the very clear opinion of this Tribunal that in the subsequent  hearing
    there will have to be for the reasons which I shall give  it  would  be
    inadvisable for the Secretary  of  State  to  be  unrepresented  again.
    Although this is a matter for the Secretary of State and this  Tribunal
    has no power to order him to  be  represented,  the  administration  of
    justice would not be assisted if he is again unrepresented.

 9. As already noted above, the claimant  succeeded  in  this  appeal,  the
    judge finding in favour of the applicant.

10. The Secretary of State now appeals against that  decision  pursuant  to
    permission granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lever  on  18  December
    2018.

11. I have had regard to the grounds, and to the oral representations  made
    on behalf of both parties and  also  to  all  the  documents  contained
    within the file, but it is not  necessary  for  the  purposes  of  this
    decision to set out in full what was said  during  the  course  of  the
    hearing.  I shall refer below only to such submissions and documents as
    are necessary for the purposes of this decision.

12. The first matter which  immediately  appears  odd  about  Judge  Lucas'
    decision is that nowhere within it does he state in terms that this  is
    an appeal founded on the Article 8 rights of the claimant.  It reads as
    if the challenge (which in effect it is) is to the decision  under  the
    Rules refusing his claim for ILR (made  under  paragraph  276B  of  the
    Rules).  That decision is not appealable now and the  only  basis  upon
    which the applicant can appeal is under Article  8.   However,  on  the
    facts of this case perhaps little turns on  this,  because  it  is  the
    claimant's case that the Tribunal would be entitled to consider whether
    or not that decision was justified because if  it  was  not,  then  for
    Article 8 purposes the decision to remove him was  not  in  the  public
    interest because he would otherwise have a right to remain.   In  those
    circumstances his  removal  would  not  be  proportionate.   There  is,
    however, a difficulty with this argument to this extent.  At  paragraph
    27 of his decision, Judge Lucas stated as follows:

         "27. It is accepted in this case that the appellant  has  submitted
             inaccurate tax returns for the  period  2010/11  and  2012/13.
             The significance of this is that he was able to  benefit  from
             further leave to remain in the UK on the basis  of  inaccurate
             financial information.  There was therefore a clear benefit to
             him."

13. If indeed he was able to remain because the earnings which  he  claimed
    for the relevant years in  question  were  in  fact  greater  than  was
    justified, such that he was granted leave to remain which he should not
    have been granted, it does not necessarily follow that it would not  be
    proportionate to refuse to grant him further leave to remain  based  on
    lawful leave that should never have been granted in the past.  However,
    for present purposes, I need do no more than note this.

14. The real reason that the judge allowed  the  appeal  was  that  he  was
    prepared to accept, albeit  that  he  considered  it  an  exceptionally
    marginal decision, that the discrepancies  within  the  income  figures
    returned to the Revenue on the one hand and the Secretary of  State  on
    the other, were genuine mistakes.  He stated  his  conclusion  in  this
    way, at paragraph 33:

         "33. Bearing in mind all of the above [to which I will return in  a
             moment] the Tribunal is - just - prepared to accept  that  the
             appellant has made genuine mistakes in this case."

15. However, when one actually looks at the reasoning behind  this,  it  is
    difficult to find any proper reasoning justifying  this  finding.   The
    judge noted at paragraph 30 what the issue was, as follows:

         "30.  These  types  of  'tax  cases'  are  always  difficult.   The
             respondent has  asserted  misconduct  and  the  appellant  has
             asserted an innocent mistake."

16. He also, at paragraph 31, states, correctly, that "there  is  no  doubt
    that the appellant has made some glaring mistakes  in  this  case.   On
    their face, the discrepancies are relatively large in the  two  periods
    in question as reflected above".

17. However, the judge only gives four reasons for  finding  ultimately  in
    favour of the claimant, and these are firstly (at  paragraph  29)  that
    "it is of significance that there is no direct allegation of dishonesty
    in this case"; secondly (at paragraph 32) that it is of significance in
    the case that the errors were corrected by the appellant prior  to  the
    claim in this case; thirdly (also at paragraph 32) that  "it  is  also,
    surely, relevant that HMRC have not  imposed  any  financial  or  other
    penalty upon the appellant" and fourthly (still at paragraph  32)  that
    "most pertinent of all, it is of note that the appellant has repaid all
    of the tax that was owing to HMRC".

18. It is simply on the basis of these facts that the Tribunal  was  "just"
    prepared to accept that the appellant "had  made  genuine  mistakes  in
    this case".  No other reasons are given.

19. None of these reasons hold up.  So far as the suggestion that there was
    "no direct allegation of dishonesty in this case".  Mr Gajjar, both  in
    the Rule 24 response which he settled and also in  his  oral  argument,
    accepts that he could not justify this assertion.  He went as far as to
    say that if this was his only reason he probably would not even be able
    to justify being here at this hearing today.  In order  to  demonstrate
    why this assertion is  untenable  it  is  necessary  to  refer  to  the
    decision of 5 February 2018 directly.  At page 5 (of 12) at the  bottom
    of the second paragraph it is written as follows:

         "Therefore if the calculation sheets you have provided are  correct
         you still owe �14,841.68 for the 2010/2011 tax year and  �13,368.13
         for the 2012/2013 tax year to HMRC.  The delay of several years  in
         correcting your declarations to HMRC indicates that you had  little
         intention of correcting the errors promptly and as such show little
         respect for the UK tax laws."

20. In other words,  what  is  being  said  is  that  this  was  deliberate
    dishonesty on the part of the claimant.  This is not an allegation of a
    bad mistake.

21. Then, two paragraphs down, it is said as follows:

         "It is therefore not a credible explanation that you would not have
         noticed the considerable discrepancy between the sums  declared  to
         HMRC  and  on  your  Tier  1  General  Application  and   the   tax
         implications this would have."

22. Again, clearly this is an allegation of dishonesty.

23. Then in the following paragraph it is said that the Secretary of State:

         "Is satisfied that you have misrepresented your earnings at various
         times and from time to time have changed what you have  represented
         in respect of your earnings to HM Revenue  and  Customs  and/or  UK
         Visas & Immigration for the purpose of reducing your tax  liability
         or for the purpose of obtaining leave to remain or both."

24. It is clear from this that the Secretary of State is asserting here  in
    terms that the claimant was dishonest either  in  under  declaring  his
    income for revenue tax purposes or for over declaring  his  income  for
    visa and immigration purposes or both.  What is alleged here is not  an
    innocent albeit gross mistake  but  deliberate  dishonesty  and  cannot
    sensibly be read in any other way.  This is made even  plainer  in  the
    following paragraph:

         "It is acknowledged that Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules
         is not a mandatory refusal; however, the  evidence  submitted  does
         not satisfactorily demonstrate that the failure to declare to  HMRC
         at the time the PAYE and self-employed  earnings  claimed  on  your
         Tier 1 applications of 04 April  2011  and  09  April  2013  was  a
         genuine error.  It is noted that there  would  have  been  a  clear
         benefit to yourself either by failing to declare your full earnings
         to HMRC with respect to reducing your tax liability or  by  falsely
         representing your earnings to UK Visas & Immigration to enable  you
         to meet the points required to obtain leave to remain in the United
         Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant."

25. Then when referring specifically  to  what  is  required  in  order  to
    succeed in an application under paragraph 276B of the Rules (that is on
    the basis of ten years' continuous lawful residence in  this  country),
    the Secretary of State's position is set out as follows:

         "She is satisfied that you have  misrepresented  your  earnings  at
         various times and from time to time  have  changed  what  you  have
         represented in respect of your earnings to  HM  Revenue  &  Customs
         and/or UK Visas & Immigration for the purposes of reducing your tax
         liability or for the purpose of obtaining leave to remain or both."

26. In other words  deliberate  dishonest  misrepresentation  of  earnings.
    There is no other meaning that these words can have.

27. Accordingly, the first reason given by Judge Lucas for  justifying  his
    finding that it was a mistake rather than  deliberate  dishonesty  does
    not stand scrutiny.

28. The second reason as stated above is that it is  of  significance  that
    the errors were corrected by the claimant prior to the  claim  in  this
    case.  Again this reason does not withstand scrutiny either.  As  noted
    above, it is well known that the Secretary of  State  now  carries  out
    checks to establish whether there has been consistency  between  income
    declared to the Revenue for  the  purpose  of  paying  tax  and  income
    claimed to UK Visas when applying for extension of visas because it  is
    a sad fact that it frequently becomes apparent that applicants such  as
    this claimant do on occasions under  represent  their  income  for  the
    purposes of paying their tax and over  declare  their  income  for  the
    purposes of establishing  their  entitlement  to  a  visa.   Each  case
    obviously has to be considered on its  own  merits,  but  it  would  be
    surprising if any intelligent applicant (and generally these are people
    who have in the past been students and are  in  other  respects  bright
    intelligent people) would not be aware that the deception that has been
    operated in the past has to be corrected for them to have any chance at
    all of now succeeding in their claim  for  ILR.   It  is  not,  in  the
    judgment of this Tribunal, and cannot be of any  significance  at  all,
    that the errors have been corrected prior to the claim  in  this  case;
    they always are, and if they are not the claim would not even  get  off
    the ground.

29. So far as the third reason is concerned, that HMRC have not imposed any
    financial or other penalty on the claimant, Mr  Gajjar  notes  that  in
    this case, unlike for example the situation referred to by Collins J in
    his decision in Samant JR/6546/2016, in which the Revenue have made  no
    enquiries at all, the Revenue it is said made a conscious decision  not
    to impose a penalty.  Mr Gajjar refers the Tribunal to a  letter  dated
    16 November  2017  in  which  in  line  with  HM  Revenue  and  Customs
    guidelines the Revenue accepts an offer of  �14,151.69  comprising  the
    tax which had not been paid of �12,049.88  together  with  interest  of
    �2,101.81, stating in terms that  "we  are  not  charging  a  penalty".
    However, one must look at this decision not to impose a penalty in  the
    context in which it is made.  As far as the Inland Revenue is concerned
    this is somebody who without any prior investigation on their part  has
    discovered that there was a "mistake"  in  their  previous  income  tax
    returns and has voluntarily disclosed this to the  Revenue.   In  those
    circumstances, were this to be all, there is no reason  why  a  penalty
    should be imposed.  Of course what the Revenue did not appreciate,  and
    would not have appreciated at the time, was the discrepancy between the
    income disclosed (on  two  separate  occasions)  on  the  one  hand  to
    themselves for the purposes of paying tax, and on the other hand to the
    immigration authorities (for whom the returns had to  be  significantly
    larger) for the purpose of claiming  renewals  of  a  visa.   In  these
    circumstances it is of no relevance at all that HMRC did not impose any
    penalty on the claimant.

30. Finally, it is also not "of  note"  or  indeed  relevant  in  any  way,
    contrary to what the judge finds, that the claimant had repaid the  tax
    that was owing to HMRC.  The same reasoning applies as with  regard  to
    making the disclosure of the under declaration in the  past;  this  was
    necessary in order to have any chance of succeeding in  the  claim  for
    ILR.

31. No other reason has been given for the finding which the judge says  he
    "just" made that this was a combination of "genuine  mistakes".   There
    has been no examination of the explanation given by  the  claimant  for
    his "mistakes" which was that he had miscalculated his turnover and  so
    on.

32. The claimant's case is, because the discrepancy  is  so  enormous  (and
    repeated) a difficult one to argue but having thought  carefully  about
    whether or not I could merely remake the decision now on the  basis  of
    the evidence which is before me and dismiss his appeal, I consider that
    that would not be the proper course to follow.  Even if at first  blush
    the claimant's case does not appear strong, he is entitled to  make  it
    and have it considered and therefore he must be allowed an  opportunity
    of so doing.

33. Both parties were agreed that on the particular  facts  of  this  case,
    because there would  have  to  be  proper  fact-finding,  it  would  be
    appropriate for this appeal now to be remitted back to  the  First-tier
    for hearing by any judge other than Judge Lucas and I shall  so  order.
    For the avoidance of any doubt I repeat what  I  stated  earlier,  that
    this is a case where it is really in the interests of justice  for  the
    Secretary of State to ensure, regardless of resource implications, that
    he (as  he  now  is)  is  represented  at  the  new  remitted  hearing.
    Accordingly I make the following decision:

Decision

I set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lucas,  allowing  the
claimant's appeal and remit the  appeal  back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
sitting at Taylor House, to be reheard by any judge other than Judge  Lucas,
de novo.  No findings of fact are to be retained.

No anonymity direction is made.
