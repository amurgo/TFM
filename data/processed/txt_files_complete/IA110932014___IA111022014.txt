For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms A Aire of Omnis Legal Services


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State has been granted permission  to  appeal  against
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox who, by  a  determination
    promulgated on 18 June 2014, allowed the appeals  of  both  appellants.
    The difficulty is that although he confirms that to be his decision and
    the  outcome  of  the  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,   his
    determination under the heading of "Findings" contains nothing at  all.
    The consequence of this is that a reader of  the  determination  simply
    does not know why the appeal was allowed.  That  is  an  error  of  law
    which requires his decision to be set aside.

2.   It may be that it would have been preferable for the judge who  granted
    permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  instead  to  consider  or
    explore the possibility that there was a  more  complete  determination
    that simply needed to be re-promulgated but permission  to  appeal  has
    been granted and there is therefore an appeal before the Upper Tribunal
    to be determined which I now do by allowing the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal to the extent that the decision of Judge Fox is  set  aside  and
    the appeal is remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  determined
    afresh.

3.   With the agreement of the parties I direct that the appeal  be  listed,
    if at all possible, before Judge Fox as that appears  to  be  the  most
    satisfactory way of reaching  a  prompt  disposal  of  this  particular
    appeal.
