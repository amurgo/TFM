                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a female citizen of Pakistan born on 24th April  1990.
    She applied for entry clearance to the UK as the spouse of the Sponsor,
    her husband Abdul Nasir,  a  British  citizen.   That  application  was
    refused firstly on 27th February 2014 and then again on  review  by  an
    Entry Clearance Manager on 13th September  2014.  There  is  a  further
    Notice of Refusal dated the 1st October 2014  The  Appellant  appealed,
    and her appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal E B  Grant
    (the Judge) sitting at Hatton Cross on 14th January 2015.  She  decided
    to dismiss the appeal for the reasons given in her Decision dated  27th
    January 2015.  The Appellant sought leave to appeal that Decision,  and
    on 10th April 2015 such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the Decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The Judge dismissed the appeal because she was not satisfied  that  the
    Appellant satisfied the financial requirements of Appendix  FM  of  the
    Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC 395.  In  particular,  the
    Judge was not satisfied that the Appellant satisfied  the  requirements
    of paragraph E-ECP.3.3.(b) of Appendix FM because the Appellant had not
    submitted personal bank statements corresponding in  time  to  payslips
    submitted over a six month period showing that the  claimed  salary  of
    the Sponsor had been paid into his bank account and therefore reflected
    his actual income and employment.

 4. At the hearing, Mr Dafar argued that the Judge  had  erred  in  law  in
    coming to that conclusion.  At paragraph 11 of the Decision, the  Judge
    referred to three payslips from  Sovereign  Cars  dated  from  June  to
    August 2013.  However, the Appellant  had  submitted  a  total  of  six
    payslips as referred to in the Notice  of  Refusal  dated  1st  October
    2014.  The Judge had therefore erred in law by not considering  all  of
    the evidence.  This was a material error of law because  if  the  Judge
    had considered all the wage slips it would have satisfied him that  the
    Appellant satisfied the financial requirements of Appendix FM.

 5. In response, Mr Bramble referred to the Rule  24  response  and  argued
    that the Judge had made no such error of law.   It  was  apparent  from
    what the Judge wrote at paragraph  12  of  the  Decision  that  he  had
    dismissed the appeal because the payslips which he had  considered  did
    not  coincide  with  receipts  into  the  Sponsor's  bank  account  and
    therefore it had not been shown that the  Appellant  had  the  required
    income.

 6. I find an error of law in the Decision of the Judge which I set  aside.
    Notwithstanding what the Judge wrote at paragraph 12 of  the  Decision,
    it is apparent from what the Judge wrote  in  the  preceding  paragraph
    that he did not consider  all  of  the  payslips  from  Sovereign  Cars
    representing the Sponsor's monthly earnings.  A failure  to  take  into
    account all the relevant evidence amounts to an error of law.

Remade Decision

 7. I proceeded to remake the Decision of  the  Judge  using  the  evidence
    which was before him.  The representatives did not  wish  to  make  any
    further submissions.

 8. There is a letter from Sovereign Cars dated 19th December 2013  stating
    that the Sponsor Abdul Nasir had been employed by them since  15th  May
    2013 as an Office  Manager  earning  ï¿½22,320  gross  per  annum.   This
    employment and level of income is confirmed by  a  series  of  payslips
    produced by the Appellant, and also corresponding  receipts  of  salary
    shown in the statements of the sponsor's  bank  account  with  Barclays
    Bank.  From this evidence I am satisfied that the  Appellant  can  meet
    the financial requirements of Appendix FM and  therefore  I  allow  the
    appeal.

Notice of Decision

The making of the Decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the Decision.

I remake the Decision in the appeal by allowing it.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  anonymity  order  and  I  find  no
reason to do so.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In the light of my  decision  to  remake  the  Decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award.   I  have  had
regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note: Fee  Awards  in  Immigration
Appeals (December 2011).  I make no fee  award  because  the  evidence  upon
which I have allowed the appeal was not before the Entry  Clearance  Officer
who first considered the application.
