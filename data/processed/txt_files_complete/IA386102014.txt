                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal brought against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Traynor promulgated on 6 February 2015  following  a  hearing  at
    Taylor House on 22 December 2014 in which he dismissed  the  appeal  of
    the appellant against the respondent's decision of  23  September  2014
    refusing an application made on 9 July 2014 for the applicant to remain
    on the basis of a relationship that he had with his unmarried  partner,
    Ms Wood, who is a British  citizen.   The  appellant  was  born  on  30
    November 1955 and is 60 years of age.  He is a citizen  of  the  United
    States of America.

 2. The crucial findings of the judge are seen in paragraphs 43 and 44.  It
    was inescapable that the appellant was granted  leave  to  enter  as  a
    fianc� and not as an unmarried partner.  The judge continued:

         "43. He has now explained that he believed he had used the  correct
             form and upon entry had not sought to challenge the fact  that
             the visa stipulated that he did enter as a  fianc�.   In  this
             case I find that ignorance of the  law  cannot  be  a  defence
             which the appellant can rely upon in order to now  claim  that
             this was the reason why he did not marry within the period  of
             time this visa permitted him.  The appellant claims that until
             he and his partner went to the Chelsea Town Hall and were told
             that  a  civil  partnership  is  different  to  an   unmarried
             partnership, that he was otherwise unaware of the  difference.
             Be that as it may, he is presumed to know the law under  which
             he has been granted entry clearance and in  this  instance  it
             was on the basis of him being a fianc� who, within the context
             of the Rules, was expected to marry within  six  months  or  a
             reasonable  period  thereafter,  subject  to  an  appropriate,
             suitable and reasonable explanation for any delay.

         44.  What is clear to me is that in his letter  of  September  2014
             the appellant stated in the most unequivocal terms that he and
             his partner intended to marry but had not been able to  do  so
             because of her ill health.  It is only when he  has  presented
             his grounds of appeal that he now claims that there was  never
             an intention to marry  until  both  he  and  his  partner  had
             agreed.  He claims that he was mistakenly issued a fianc� visa
             when, all along, he wanted entry  clearance  as  an  unmarried
             partner.  I must question why it was that  the  appellant  did
             not put forward that suggestion when he had  no  intention  of
             marrying until after the application was refused, when it  was
             clearly open to him in  replying  to  the  earlier  letter  of
             August 2014 that he considered there was a mistake.   At  that
             stage the appellant could easily have alerted  the  respondent
             to the fact that he wished other  factors  to  be  taken  into
             account but he did not do so."

 3. The reference to the letter of 3 September is a letter which  is  found
    in the bundle and in which it is said by the appellant: "Second I  want
    to assure you that it is Susie's and my intent to get  married  in  the
    near future".

 4. The decision of the judge followed the respondent's decision made on 23
    September 2014 in which consideration was given to the route by which a
    non-national may  seek  entry  clearance  or  leave  to  remain  as  an
    unmarried partner of a British citizen  and  there  were  a  number  of
    matters which were raised against the appellant.  One of those  matters
    was that the Secretary of State did not consider that the applicant and
    his partner were in a genuine and subsisting relationship.  That was no
    longer in issue before the judge when the matter came  up  for  hearing
    and it is certainly no longer in issue before me.

 5. However, in the decision reliance was placed on E-LTRP.1.11  which  was
    that if the applicant  is  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  leave  as  a
    fianc�(e)  or  proposed  civil  partner  and  the  marriage  or   civil
    partnership did not take place during that period of leave, there  must
    be a good reason why and evidence that it will take  place  within  the
    next six months.  The applicant did not supply that information and  it
    was pointed out by the judge that the fact that the appellant's partner
    was suffering some medical  problems  did  not  preclude  the  marriage
    taking place within the six months and that  the  visa  made  it  quite
    clear that as a fianc� he was  required  to  marry  within  six  months
    unless there was a suitable reason.  No proper reason was  put  forward
    and accordingly the decision under the  Rules  had  to  fail  for  that
    reason alone.

 6. It is important to consider the period of time in which the parties had
    been cohabiting as set out in paragraph 17  of  the  determination.   I
    need not trouble with the early stages of the relationship but  by  the
    time the middle of 2012 had come about it is  clear  that  the  parties
    were spending a considerable amount of  time  together  in  the  United
    States of America from 18 June to 8  July.   They  spent  further  time
    together from 13 to 29 September and it was then their case that from 1
    November 2012 and continuing  they  had  been  cohabiting.   The  judge
    reached a conclusion on that in  paragraph  14  of  the  determination,
    finding that although the relationship has subsisted since 2011 it  was
    not  the  case  that  they  were  living  in  a  permanent  or   stable
    relationship until December 2012.

 7. He did not accept that the fact that they had a credit card to which Ms
    Wood's name had been added in July 2012 was  evidence  that  they  were
    living together, and accordingly he made what is a sustainable  finding
    of fact that the relationship did  not  reach  the  stage  of  being  a
    permanent or stable relationship until December 2012.  It was  at  that
    stage therefore that  they  were  living  in  a  relationship  akin  to
    marriage.

 8. The consequences  of  that  on  the  timescale  are  as  follows.   The
    application was made for leave to remain on 9 July 2014 at which  time,
    according to the judge,  they  had  been  in  a  relationship  akin  to
    marriage for about eighteen months.  The decision itself was made on 23
    September 2014.  Once again, at that stage  they  had  not  been  in  a
    relationship which had lasted for as much as two years.

 9. It was of course the case that when the matter came before the judge on
    22 December 2014 by that stage they had been living in  a  relationship
    of almost exactly two  years  and  nobody  is  suggesting  that  on  22
    December 2014 the two years had not by that stage elapsed.

10. Accordingly the issue that was principally argued before me was that it
    was open to the judge in December 2014 to allow the appeal on the basis
    that the requirements of the application should be  looked  at  at  the
    date of the hearing and should be allowed  because  those  requirements
    had been met in December 2014.

11. That in my judgment relies upon a misunderstanding of what the Tribunal
    said in EA (Section 85 (4) explained) Nigeria [2007] UKAIT 00013 and in
    particular it is said that the judge got it wrong by not applying these
    words which arise in paragraph 7 of the determination of the Tribunal:

         "The correct  interpretation  of  Section  85(4)  is  perhaps  best
         indicated by saying that the appellant cannot  succeed  by  showing
         that he would be granted leave if he made  an  application  on  the
         date of the hearing: he can succeed only by showing that  he  would
         be granted leave if he made, on the date of the hearing,  the  same
         application as that which resulted in the decision under appeal."

12. It is as well to remind oneself as to the contents  of  Section  85(4).
    The material parts are:

         "On an appeal under Section 82(1) against a decision  the  Tribunal
         may consider evidence about any matter which it thinks relevant  to
         the substance of the decision, including evidence which concerns  a
         matter arising after the date of the decision."

    Accordingly the principles with which I  am  concerned  relate  to  the
    substance of  the  decision.   In  relation  to  any  analysis  of  the
    substance of the decision it is permissible  to  look  at  postdecision
    material which, colloquially speaking, 'sheds light' on  the  substance
    of the decision.

13.  The most obvious case is where it is said  that  a  particular  sum  of
    money had to be in the hands of  the  appellant  at  the  date  of  the
    decision but evidence of that was not put forward by the  appellant  at
    the date the decision was made.  It would be open to the  appellant  to
    include at the hearing evidence that, at the date of decision,  he  had
    in fact that sum of money in his bank  account.   In  other  words  the
    Tribunal does not make a decision  as  at  the  date  of  the  hearing.
    Rather it permits evidence at the date of the hearing to throw light on
    what is the lawfulness of the earlier decision.  That is clear from the
    circumstances of paragraph 7 in its entirety which reads as follows:

         "It is thus not open to an appellant to argue simply that,  on  the
         date of the hearing, he meets the requirements of  the  Immigration
         Rules.  He can succeed only if he shows that the decision that  was
         made was one which was  not  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration
         Rules.  Section 85(4) allows him  to  show  that  by  reference  to
         evidence of matters postdating the decision itself, and it may well
         be that the effect is that the question for the Tribunal in an  in-
         country case is whether the decision can be justified as a  correct
         one at the date of the hearing.  But that does not  mean  that  the
         Tribunal is  the  primary  decision  maker.   The  Tribunal's  task
         remains that of hearing appeals against  decisions  actually  made.
         The  correct  interpretation  of  Section  85(4)  is  perhaps  best
         indicated by saying that the appellant cannot  succeed  by  showing
         that he would be granted leave if he made  an  application  on  the
         date of the hearing ..."

13. The circumstances of the decision in the case of EA show that principle
    being put into effect.  In paragraph 9 of the determination  the  judge
    recounted the circumstances which gave rise to the appeal:

         "As soon as the appellant realised that Anfell College had  closed,
         he supplemented his application by letter indicating  that  he  now
         sought leave to remain in order to study at Holborn College  rather
         than Anfell College.  Mr Avery was able to confirm that the  letter
         was now on file: it was posted on 30 January and  received  in  the
         Home Office on 2 February, some days before the decision was  made.
         It is evident that it had not reached the file in time, and so  the
         decision related solely to Anfell College without taking account of
         the amendment to his application that the appellant had submitted."

14. The material words in this passage are that there  was  material  which
    the Secretary of State was required to  take  into  account  which  was
    material the Home Office received some days  before  the  decision  was
    made and which should have been the basis of a revised application,  an
    application made  to  study  at  Holborn  College  rather  than  Anfell
    College.  It was for that reason that the Tribunal  considered  whether
    or not  it  was  able  to  look  at  that  fresh  material.   What  the
    determination does not say is that it was open  to  this  applicant  in
    December 2012 to make an application which the Tribunal was required to
    consider on the basis that, at the date of the hearing, he had been  in
    a relationship akin to marriage for a period in excess of two years.

15. The function of the judge was to look at the decision that was made  in
    July of 2014 and whether that was a decision made  in  accordance  with
    the Immigration Rules or in accordance with the law, and  it  is  plain
    that that decision was a decision which was correctly made  because  in
    July 2014,  however  one  looked  at  the  postdecision  evidence,  the
    applicant had not fulfilled the requirements.

16. In addition to this, the decision was considered on  the  basis  of  E-
    LTRP.1.11, and that was that,  if  the  applicant  was  in  the  United
    Kingdom with leave as a fianc�, the marriage should  have  taken  place
    within that period of leave and there had to be a good reason  why  not
    and evidence to support it and that it would take place within the next
    six months.  Of course there was no such evidence.   The  justification
    provided by the appellant was not considered to be satisfactory.  There
    is no reason why the couple should not have married.  The justification
    by the applicant was that he did not think that he got entry  clearance
    as a fianc� and consequently he  did  not  need  to  comply  with  that
    requirement but that  was  belied  by  the  letter  that  he  wrote  in
    September 2014, to which  I  have  referred,  where  he  said  that  he
    intended to marry in the near future.  That  was  contradicted  by  the
    evidence that he gave and which was to the effect that they were  quite
    happy living as they were and that they had no intention of marrying at
    that time.

17. So, on any view, the decision that was made by the judge in relation to
    the application was a lawful decision and the fact that the  applicants
    have now acquired two years of cohabitation akin to  marriage  was  not
    one which the judge was required to, or indeed could, take into account
    for the purposes of seeing whether the requirements of  the  Rules  had
    been met.

18. There then comes a consideration as to whether there was an  Article  8
    claim whereby the applicant could properly put forward a claim that  he
    should be entitled to leave to remain as a  result  of  the  principles
    identified in Chikwamba v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2008] UKHL 40.  This  provides  a  sensible  limitation  on  an  over-
    officious stance by the Secretary of State requiring that an individual
    who demonstrates that he can meet the requirements for entry  clearance
    should not in those circumstances be expected to make a long journey to
    make an application for entry clearance which  will  almost  inevitably
    succeed.

19. In a case where an applicant has no immigration history which  operates
    against him it would be disproportionate to require that individual  to
    seek entry clearance from abroad.  The only benefit would be that there
    has been formal compliance with the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The amour propre, as it were, of the Secretary of  State  would
    be maintained but at a cost which was disproportionate, namely the cost
    of  travelling  back  to  the  country  of   nationality,   making   an
    application, awaiting the outcome of that application and returning  to
    the United Kingdom when the result is a foregone conclusion.

20. In this case, however, the judge dealt with Chikwamba in this way:

         "In the first instance I find that in the  absence  of  any  health
         grounds and while I  find  that  reasons  advanced  concerning  the
         appellant's partner's relationship with her parents  are  simply  a
         matter of convenience then I find that  the  respondent's  decision
         does not presume the outcome  of  such  an  application  for  entry
         clearance as being a formality.  What the respondent  requires  the
         applicant to do is to demonstrate that he can meet the requirements
         for entry clearance as an unmarried partner.  The outcome  of  that
         application is not a foregone conclusion."

    Accordingly the judge found that it was therefore not a case where  the
    Chikwamba principles made it an entirely unnecessary  exercise.   There
    was therefore a public interest in ensuring that there was  an  out  of
    country application.

21. In reaching that conclusion it is clear  that  the  judge  accepted  in
    paragraph 55 of the determination that the appellant speaks English and
    appears to be financially self-sufficient,  thereby  at  least  meeting
    some  of  the  requirements  for  entry  clearance  in  this  capacity.
    However, what the decision has within it is the fact that the  original
    decision to refuse entry clearance was a lawful decision.  That  was  a
    decision  that  was  made  because  the  applicant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements for leave to remain.  He did  not  meet  the  requirements
    because, as I have pointed out, he had been granted leave as  a  fianc�
    and that during that period of leave he had failed to  provide  a  good
    reason why the marriage had not taken place or provided  evidence  that
    the marriage would take place within six months.  We know as  a  matter
    of fact of course that no marriage has not since taken place.

22. In those circumstances it does not seem to me that it can be said  that
    there is no public interest in  requiring  the  appellant  to  make  an
    application for entry clearance in the correct capacity.  He had failed
    in his application that was made on 9 July 2014.  He knew about that on
    23 September 2014 and the option remained with him to leave the  United
    Kingdom and apply for entry clearance, meeting the requirements as they
    may be  from  time  to  time  for  entry  clearance  at  the  time  the
    application is made in the United States of America.

23. For these reasons I am not satisfied that, because the application  for
    leave to remain has been refused for the good reasons set  out  in  the
    decision made by the Secretary of State, the applicant can nevertheless
    succeed without making an application out of country as he is  normally
    required to do by applying the Chikwamba principles.  It  may  well  be
    that some of those requirements have  been  established  but  where  an
    individual has been lawfully refused entry clearance or leave to remain
    under the strength of the Immigration  Rules  the  public  interest  in
    requiring him to leave the United Kingdom and regularise  his  position
    is a real one and the judge was correct in saying  that  the  Chikwamba
    principles did not apply to prevent the Secretary of State from seeking
    the appellant's removal.

24. I find that the judge made no material error of law and I  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal.

DECISION

The judge made no material error and the  determination  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
