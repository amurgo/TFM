For the Appellant:     Mr Tan Senior Presenting Officer

For the Respondents:   Ms McCall, instructed by Waterstone Solicitors



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Respondents are husband  and  wife.  They  are  both  nationals  of
    Bangladesh. On the 21st January 2020 the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed
    their appeals on human rights grounds. The Secretary of State  now  has
    permission to appeal against that decision.

 2. The appellants before the First-tier Tribunal - here the Respondents  -
    were overstayers at the time that  they  made  their  applications  for
    leave to remain. Mr Malik held valid leave to be in the United  Kingdom
    between the 10th October 2009 when he arrived, and the  6th  July  2018
    when his last grant of leave expired. His wife, who only arrived on the
    3rd January 2017, had been  granted  leave  in  line  with  him.    The
    applications were made on the 18th July 2018.   The case put  was  that
    Mr Malik had accrued 11 years long residence in this country, and given
    that much of that was lawful should enjoy  the  benefit  of  discretion
    being exercised in his favour under paragraph 276B of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Alternatively, it was argued that it would be a disproportionate
    interference with the composite Article 8 rights of the  family  -  the
    Respondent's and their young child - should they be refused leave now.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal  first  tackled  the  question  of  276B.  That
    paragraph of  the  rules  provides  that  applicants  will  be  granted
    indefinite leave to remain where they can establish that they have held
    ten years of continuous lawful residence in the  United  Kingdom.    Mr
    Malik had held such leave only for 8 years and 9 months. The First-tier
    Tribunal considered, and discounted, the possibility that paragraph 39E
    of the rules would avail him. That paragraph permits the  Secretary  of
    State to exercise her  discretion  where  the  applicant  has  made  an
    application for further leave within 14  days  of  the  previous  leave
    expiring.  That paragraph would of course only be of assistance  to  Mr
    Malik if it operated to cover a short gap  between  periods  of  lawful
    residence, i.e. where the out of time  application  resulted  in  leave
    being granted. Since it had not been  granted  in  this  case,  it  was
    irrelevant. The Tribunal correctly noted that it  did  not  operate  to
    extent existing leave in the manner provided for by section 3C  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971.

 4. The Tribunal then turned to consider Article 8 'outside of the  rules'.
    It appears to proceed on the assumption that Article 8 was engaged  and
    that the "first 4" Razgar questions could be  answered  positively  [at
    ï¿½22].   It made the following findings of fact:

      i) There are  no  unsurmountable  obstacles  to  the  Respondents  re-
         integrating in Bangladesh. They have family support there, are well
         educated and have already  demonstrated  their  resourcefulness  by
         establishing a business in a foreign country;

     ii) The couple's child is not  'qualifying'  as  defined  by  s117D  of
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002;

    iii) It is in the child's best interests to remain with her parents  and
         return to Bangladesh;

     iv) Although the Respondent's believed the legal advice that that  they
         had been  given,  and  thought  that  their  application  would  be
         successful, the solicitors were not in fact  at  fault  and  so  no
         weight could be attached to that matter.

 5. Having taken those matters  into  account  the  Tribunal  concluded  as
    follows:

         "The issue is whether it is proportionate to now ask him leave. The
         one matter that the respondent advances is the  maintenance  of  an
         effective immigration control. There being no issues with regard to
         suitability. The Respondent was content to allow the  appellant  to
         make his application within the 14 day period and take payment  for
         the same. The Respondent was content for him to remain  in  the  UK
         whilst this application / the subsequent variation was  considered.
         There was no effort to remove the  Appellant  or  his  family.  The
         Respondent would no  doubt  hope  that  an  Appellant  would  leave
         voluntarily, but having lodged a further application and  paid  for
         the same it is understandable that  the  appellant  would  seek  to
         remain  until  this  was  concluded.  Once  the   application   was
         considered he was provided with an in-country right of  appeal,  so
         again, despite being an overstayer, the Appellant  was  allowed  to
         stay in the UK to see his appeal through to its conclusion. Yet  it
         is the Respondent's position it is now, having been in the  UK  for
         over 10 years, proportionate to remove the appellant and his family
         and it would be in pursuance of an effective immigration control to
         do so. I do not find that it is. I find  the  length  of  time  the
         Appellant has spent in the UK, together with the money invested  in
         his business and the Respondent's acquiescence in him remaining  in
         the UK after the application of  July  2018  was  lodged  means  to
         remove him now would be  a  disproportionate  interference  in  the
         family and private life that he has developed in the UK".

 6. The First-tier Tribunal thereby allowed the appeal.

 7. Having heard the submissions of the parties I am  satisfied  that  this
    reasoning is unsustainable.

 8. The Tribunal appears to give substantial weight to the  fact  that  the
    Secretary of State has quite properly permitted the Respondents to make
    human rights claims and allowed them to remain in  the  country  whilst
    these claims are processed and appealed. It is very  difficult  to  see
    how that could possibly reduce the public interest in refusing leave to
    those who do not qualify under the rules: there  was  for  instance  no
    legitimate expectation that leave would flow from the claims. Nor can I
    readily understand why the Tribunal might have thought  that  it  would
    add weight to the  Respondents'  side  of  the  scales:  there  was  no
    significant delay in  the  decision  being  made  and  so  it  was  not
    confronted with an EB (Kosovo) type situation in which Article 8 rights
    had demonstrably strengthened whilst the Home Office dallied.   It  was
    an error of law to take this immaterial factor into account.

 9.  The  decision  makes  no  reference  at  all  to  s117B   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The  Tribunal  has  referred  to  "the
    maintenance of an effective immigration control" but  contrary  to  the
    passage cited above, this was not the "one matter" relied upon  by  the
    Secretary of State. No consideration was given, for  instance,  to  the
    injunction that only a little weight may be given  to  a  private  life
    established whilst the subject's immigration status is precarious. That
    was of material significance in this appeal.   It was an error  of  law
    to fail to take s117B into account.

10. Two matters are identified that weighed in the Respondent's favour:  Mr
    Malik's relatively long residence and the fact that he has  invested  a
    considerable amount of money into his business in the  United  Kingdom.
    It may be that in the final analysis, these matters could  legitimately
    weigh in his favour in a properly conducted  proportionality  balancing
    exercise.  At this stage I am however unable to say that  they  are  of
    such weight that the errors set out above are rendered immaterial.  For
    that reason I consider that the most appropriate disposal  is  for  the
    decision to be set aside and the  matter  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for hearing de novo by a judge other than Judge GD Davison.

    Decisions

11. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains material error of
    law and it is set aside.

12. The decision in the appeal is to be remade de novo  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by a Judge other than Judge GD Davidson.

13. There is no order for anonymity.
