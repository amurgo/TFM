Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Alam, Counsel instructed by Khan's Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Lindsay, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals, with permission, against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Bristow) (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the
    "FtTJ") promulgated on the  26th  April  2018  in  which  the  Tribunal
    dismissed his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State  to
    refuse his protection and human rights claim  in  the  context  of  the
    respondent having made a deportation order against  him  under  Section
    32(5) (of the UK Borders Act 2007).

 2. The FtT did not make an anonymity direction. However as  the  appellant
    has made a protection claim we think it right at this stage to  make  a
    direction regarding anonymity under Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal Rules) Rules 2008.  Unless  and  until  a  Tribunal  or
    court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report
    of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify  her.   This
    direction applies both to the Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure
    to  comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to  contempt  of  court
    proceedings.

Background:

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born in  1989.  He  entered  the
    United Kingdom on the 27 February 1991 with his mother and was  granted
    six months leave to enter.

 4. On 15th of March 1991 his mother claimed asylum  and  in  October  1994
    claim was refused. Her appeal against the decision was dismissed on  26
    June 1998.

 5. On 23rd of October 2002 the appellant's mother made an application  for
    leave to remain under the seven-year child concession stating that  she
    had separated from her husband due to domestic violence.

 6. On 14 January 2003 the appellant's mother submitted an application  for
    settlement including the appellant as her dependant.

 7. On 10 March 2003 the appellant was granted indefinite leave  to  remain
    (ILR) as the dependent of his mother, who was granted  by  ILR  on  the
    basis of the seven-year child concession.

His criminality:

 8. On 18 April 2007 he was convicted at the Juvenile Court of  two  counts
    of attempted robbery and given a referral order for nine months. On  11
    July 2007 the referral order was revoked, and he was re-sentenced to  a
    community order, with a supervision requirement for  12  months  and  a
    curfew requirement for 30 days.

 9. On 11 July 2007  he  was  convicted  of  robbery  and  sentenced  to  a
    community order, with a supervision requirement for  12  months  and  a
    curfew requirement for 30 days.

10. On 7 July 2011 he was convicted of possessing a controlled drug  (class
    B cannabis) and fined �33.

11. On 26 August 2016 the appellant was convicted at the Crown Court for  a
    number of offences of robbery and attempted robbery. He faced  a  nine-
    count indictment which included counts 7-9 representing the  possession
    of an imitation firearm when committing a schedule one offence.

12. On 22nd of December 2016 he was sentenced to 6 �  years'  imprisonment.
    The sentencing remarks are set out at [G1]. The appellant  had  pleaded
    guilty to 4 offences of robbery, five offences of attempted robbery and
    three offences of possession of an imitation firearm  at  the  time  of
    committing the offences. The offences were committed  between  11  June
    and 1 August 2016.

13. On 11 June he committed three offences;  two  of  robbery  and  one  of
    attempted robbery. He committed a robbery at a betting office and  five
    minutes later went into a store where he produced an imitation  firearm
    to the cashier who was five months pregnant.  That  was  the  attempted
    robbery. From there he went to a large chemist where he again  produced
    an imitation firearm and robbed the assistant of �50.  This  was  later
    recovered from a bin at the rear of the store.

14. On 20 June  he  committed  three  offences  of  attempted  robbery;  he
    attempted to rob another store by threatening the assistant  with  acid
    and at 6:30 PM and 7:05 PM attempted to rob  a  betting  office  and  a
    coffee shop by threatening the assistant with the bomb. He was arrested
    for the betting office offence on 20 June which  he  admitted  and  was
    then released on bail.

15. On 27th July carried out robbery at a bookmaker where he stole �450  by
    threatening to shoot the assistant there. He was arrested  on  30  July
    for the offences at the bookmakers and the coffee shop on 20 June.   He
    admitted them and again was released on bail.

16. On 31 July he attempted to rob a  bookmaker  by  threatening  to  throw
    excrement and urine over the counter.

17. On 1 August he robbed a bookmaker of �330  by  producing  an  imitation
    firearm and demanding the cash.

18. It had been agreed between the parties that those  offences  fell  into
    the category of less sophisticated, commercial robberies. The Judge was
    satisfied that where imitation firearms or  other  legal  weapons  were
    produced, they fell within category A of high culpability and  category
    2 harm. However, the sheer number of the offences put them outside  the
    Sentencing Council Guidelines.

19.  The  judge  identified  the  following  aggravating  features  in  the
    appellant's case; he had previous convictions for one robbery  and  two
    attempted robberies which were all street offences; they were committed
    in 2007 when he was 17 years old so they were over nine  years  old  at
    the time of the present offences and  therefore  the  judge  discounted
    them. Secondly, the  appellant  had  committed  the  robberies  of  the
    bookmakers on 22 July  and  the  robbery  of  betting  office  and  the
    possession of the imitation firearm on  the  1  August,  the  attempted
    robbery of a further betting office on 31 July whilst on bail, and  the
    last three offences in time when he had also been granted bail  on  two
    separate occasions. The judge considered that  it  merited  consecutive
    sentences.

20. The judge accepted that they were not sophisticated offences and  on  a
    number of occasions he took no steps to disguise  his  appearance.  The
    pre-sentence report and the psychiatric report revealed  that  he  been
    addicted to gambling and carried out the offences in order to  frighten
    the staff into handing over money with which he intended to  carry  out
    further gambling.

21. The judge gave full credit to guilty pleas but reached  the  conclusion
    that the offences were so serious that only a  custodial  sentence  was
    appropriate. He was not assessed as a "dangerous offender"  as  defined
    and therefore determinate sentences were imposed. The  judge  therefore
    sentenced the appellant to a total of 6 � years' imprisonment.

22. As a result of his criminality, on  June  1,  2017  the  appellant  was
    served with a stage I deportation decision (see H1-H7).

23. On 16 June 2017 his solicitors Malik  Law  Chambers  responded  stating
    that deportation would breach his  human  rights  (at  [I1-I115]).  The
    submissions made reference to his immigration history-  having  arrived
    in the UK with his parents in 1991 aged one year and two  months  lived
    all of his life in the UK and that he was granted ILR in 2003.

24. It was stated that he had two sisters and a brother living in the UK  -
    all were born in the UK and were British nationals.  His  parents  were
    settled and had ILR. He had close extended family members and had lived
    with his mother and siblings before he was sent to prison.  He  had  no
    memory of life in Pakistan and had always considered  himself  British.
    He had been outside the UK only once and he did not speak the Pakistani
    language having grew up in Britain with limited exposure  to  Pakistani
    culture. In  Pakistan  he  would  have  no  friends,  family,  home  or
    knowledge of the language or culture as he had adapted to  the  English
    way of way of life.

25. It was said he had no connections in Pakistan and would have difficulty
    surviving because he could not speak the language, and not  having  any
    relations or links  to  the  Pakistani  culture  which  would  make  it
    difficult to adapt to life in Pakistan. He would not be able to find  a
    job to establish himself there.

26. Furthermore, it was asserted the due to his depression he would not  be
    able to adjust, and  this  would  make  sense  of  local  customs  more
    difficulties.

27.  It  was  asserted  that  there  were   "compelling   and   exceptional
    circumstances" and that his  removal  violated  his  human  rights  and
    Article 8.

28. At paragraph 5 [G13] the letter provided a number of documents from  1-
    14.

29. The appellant made a human right claim on the 16 June 2017.

30. On 8 January 2018 a deportation order was made. (see [K1]).

31. On the 9 January 2018 a decision was made  to  refuse  a  human  rights
    claim.

The respondent's decision:

32. The decision letter set out that Section 32 (5) of the UK  Borders  Act
    2007 required a deportation order be made against him unless  he  could
    demonstrate that he fell within any of the specified exceptions set out
    in Section 33 of that Act.  The decision letter made reference  to  his
    immigration history and his criminal offending.

33. It also set out the basis of his Article 8 claim and took into  account
    the submissions provided from Malik law Chambers from their  letter  as
    summarised above.

34. It was stated that his deportation was conducive to public good and  in
    the public interest because he had been convicted  of  an  offence  for
    which he  been  sentenced  to  imprisonment  of  at  least  four  years
    therefore in accordance paragraph 398, of the  Immigration  Rules,  the
    public interest required his deportation unless  he  could  show  "very
    compelling circumstances",  over  and  above  those  described  in  the
    exceptions of deportation set out at paragraph 399 and 399A.

35.  The  respondent  considered  that  there  were  no  "very   compelling
    circumstances" and  that  there  was  significant  public  interest  in
    deporting him because:

       . It was not accepted that he was socially and culturally  integrated
         in the UK because he was convicted of criminal offences;

       . The criminal offences were committed for monetary gain;

       . He used threats towards the victims to make them  comply  with  his
         demands for money;

       . He used imitation firearms, threatened to  shoot  the  victims  and
         threatened them with acid and stated he had a bomb;

       . The victims would have  been  in  fear  of  their  lives  and  very
         traumatised and

       . this established a pattern of violent offending behaviour;

       . He had been assessed of being a high risk in the community  to  the
         public and medium risk to children;

       . He committed further offences whilst on police bail  and  this  was
         indicative of his disregard for the laws of the UK;

       . At the time of the arrest he was in receipt of  employment  support
         allowance therefore he was not making a positive contribution to UK
         society;

       . It was stated that he suffered from mental health problems but  had
         not submitted any evidence  to  support  this  claim.  The  medical
         records from the prison stated that he was not being prescribed any
         medication and was fit to fly.

36. It was not accepted that there would be very significant  obstacles  to
    his integration to Pakistan because;

       .  he  was  an  adult  and  was  considered  to  be  able   to   live
         independently,

       . whilst he had not lived in Pakistan since he  was  a  baby  it  was
         considered that he would have been exposed to Pakistani culture and
         therefore would be able to adapt to life in Pakistan

       . he did visit Pakistan in 2004 when 14 years of  age  and  had  some
         knowledge of life in Pakistan

       . when considering the claim that he would be  homeless,  his  family
         could continue to support him in the way that they have done in the
         UK;

       . family members could travel to  Pakistan  to  assist  in  with  his
         integration in the country;

       . he was employed as a driver/operative and could  use  those  skills
         acquired to obtain employment in Pakistan.

37. As to family ties, it was noted that his father, mother brother and two
    sisters lived in  the  UK.  Relationships  with  adult  applicants  and
    parents and siblings does not constitute family life  without  evidence
    of further elements of dependency beyond normal emotional ties and  the
    appellant had not demonstrated that any such  dependency  existed.  The
    appellant stated that his family had given him support and guidance and
    help with stabilising him at this difficult time when he went  "on  the
    wrong path". The respondent did not think that was demonstrated in view
    of the fact that he had  committed  very  serious  offences  which  had
    resulted in a sentence of six and half year's imprisonment.

38. He stated that he did not speak the Pakistani language however  he  was
    raised by his mother and father who both requested an Urdu  interpreter
    at the time of their respective immigration appeals. It  was  therefore
    considered that he would be familiar with the language in Pakistan  and
    able to communicate on his return.

39. There was  significant  public  interest  in  deporting  the  appellant
    because of his criminality; he had received  convictions  for  robbery,
    attempted  robbery  and  possessing  controlled  drugs  and  possessing
    imitation  firearms  and  committing  offences.  There  has   been   an
    escalation of the seriousness of his offending and his been assessed as
    a high risk in the community of causing serious harm to the public.

40. He had not provided evidence of a very strong Article 8 claim over  and
    above the circumstances described in exceptions to deportation.

The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal:

41. The appellant's solicitors issued grounds of appeal on the 22nd January
    2018.

42. On 18 April 2018 the appellant's appeal was  heard  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

43. At paragraph 13 he set out the factual and legal issues which were  not
    in dispute-

      1) the appellant is a foreign criminal within the meaning  of  section
         117D (2) of the 2002 Act;

      2) the appellant had been lawfully resident in the UK for most of  his
         life and

      3) the appellant could not and was not seeking to rely on exception  2
         in section 117C (5) of the 2002 Act.

44. At paragraph 14 the  judge  identified  the  issues  that  remained  in
    dispute:

      1) whether the appellant was socially and culturally  integrated  into
         the UK (section 117C (4) (b) of the 2002 Act);

      2) whether they would be very significant obstacles to the appellant's
         integration into Pakistan if he were to be deported  (section  117C
         (4) of the 2002 Act) and

      3)  whether  the  appellant   could   demonstrate   "very   compelling
         circumstances" over and above those described in exceptions one and
         two (section 117C (6) of the 2002 Act).

45. After setting out the relevant law, the judge  made  reference  to  the
    factual issues that were in dispute at paragraph 21. He identified that
    the factual disputes between the  appellant  and  the  respondent  were
    limited to whether the appellant could speak Urdu and  whether  he  had
    any connection to Pakistan and whether he suffered from depression.

46. At paragraphs 22 - 32 the judge set out his findings of fact.

47. They can be summarised as follows:

       . the appellant speaks English and Urdu. He speaks that  language  at
         home with his mother. The appellant's written evidence  stated  the
         did not speak any Pakistani language. His  sister  in  her  written
         evidence stated that the appellant  did  not  speak  any  Pakistani
         language fluently. Both departed from those assertions in  evidence
         in chief and accepted that he does speak Urdu as well as English.

       . The appellant had a maternal grandmother and grandfather living  in
         Lahore aged 89 years of age and had mobility  issues.  He  had  two
         maternal uncles in Pakistan. One of those  uncles  lives  with  his
         maternal grandparents in Lahore with  his  wife  and  children.  He
         cares for the grandparents and he is aged 50 to 55 years of age.

       . His maternal relations in Pakistan speak Urdu and are Muslims.

       . The appellant's mother is in contact with her parents and  she  has
         contact with her brothers.

       .  The  appellant's  sister  H  is  in  contact  with  her   maternal
         grandparents every month or so.

       . The appellant asserted  that  he  did  not  have  connections  with
         Pakistan "in any manner whatsoever". His  sister  H  was  asked  to
         explain why she did have contact with family in  Pakistan  when  he
         did not. She explained  this  only  by  stating  "he  doesn't  feel
         connected to them... He's never focused on relations in Pakistan...
         He's really not connected.". At [29] the judge stated that  he  did
         not find that explanation sufficient; it did not explain why he did
         not feel connected and was not  sufficiently  detailed.  The  judge
         recorded that the appellant did not offer an  explanation  himself.
         His mother simply asserted that he  had  no  connections  with  her
         family in Pakistan. In the absence of  a  satisfactory  explanation
         and having found that the appellant's mother  and  sister  were  in
         contact with family in Pakistan, he  was  not  satisfied  that  the
         appellant had demonstrated that he had  no  contact  with  maternal
         family in Pakistan. The judge found that he did have at least  some
         contact with them (at [31]).

       . As to his assertion that he suffered from depression. The appellant
         accepted that he was not taking any medication for  that  condition
         nor did  he  produce  any  medical  evidence  to  corroborate  that
         assertion. The medical material in the bundle at J1 -  J3  did  not
         refer to any diagnosis of depression or any prescription. The judge
         who sentenced him  in  2016  had  a  psychiatric  report  and  this
         revealed that he was addicted to gambling and that he  had  carried
         out offences to frighten staff into handing over money.  The  judge
         was not satisfied that he proved the civil  standard  that  he  was
         suffering from depression (at [32]).

48. The judge then considered the relevant factors at paragraphs 33 - 61 of
    his decision.

49. As to the seriousness of the appellant's offences (section 117C(2))  at
    paragraphs 33 - 36) the judge summarised the  criminal  offences  which
    had resulted in a total  period  of  imprisonment  of  6  �  years  and
    expressly took into account the sentencing remarks which was set out in
    full at G1 - 11 of the respondent's bundle.

50. He concluded at [37] that the appellant's offences  are  "plainly  very
    serious".  He stated that: "The  total  sentence  is  2  �  half  years
    greater than the four years which Parliament  has  determined  requires
    the  appellant's  deportation  unless  he  can  show  very   compelling
    circumstances over and above  Exceptions  1  and  2."  The  judge  also
    observed that if the appellant had not  pleaded  guilty  at  the  first
    reasonable opportunity, the sentence would have been  somewhere  around
    nine years.

51. As to the issue of whether the appellant was  socially  and  culturally
    integrated into the UK, at paragraphs 39 to 40 the judge was  satisfied
    that he had proved to the required standard that he was culturally  and
    socially integrated into the UK for the following reasons;

       . he had been in the UK since he was 14 months of age,

       . he had been in the UK for all but 14 months of his 28-year life,

       . his primary and secondary education was in the UK,

       . he had completed a plumbing apprenticeship and other  training  and
         been employed in the cleaning industry between 2012 and 2016,

       . he had paid tax and national insurance contributions,

       . he spoke English.

    The judge rejected the respondent's argument that  the  convictions  he
    had meant that he was not culturally and socially integrated  into  the
    UK based on the above findings.

52. As to the issue of whether there were very significant obstacles to his
    integration into Pakistan, the judge was  not  satisfied  that  he  had
    proved to the required standard that there would  be  very  significant
    obstacles.

53. His reasoning is set out at paragraphs 41-52.

       . He has only returned to Pakistan on one occasion having  spent  his
         entire life, save for 14 months in the UK

       . the appellant can speak Urdu which is spoken in Pakistan and by the
         appellant's family and he can also speak English which is spoken in
         Pakistan. The appellant is bilingual, and this will facilitate  his
         integration into Pakistan.

       . The appellant has family in Pakistan and has at least some  contact
         with them;

       . they will be able to advise and assist him so he can be  enough  of
         an insider to have a  reasonable  opportunity  to  be  accepted  in
         Pakistan;

       . their  guidance  will  assist  the  appellant  to  build  up  in  a
         reasonable time of variety of human relationships, over  and  above
         relationships with his family in Pakistan to give substance to  his
         private and family life.

       . He will  have  contact  on  arrival  in  Pakistan  and  whilst  the
         grandparents were elderly and had mobility issues,  they  will  not
         need to assist a relatively fit and healthy young man physically;

       . even if that was incorrect and he did not  have  contact  with  his
         family in Pakistan, his mother and sister are in contact with their
         relatives. "It is inconceivable that  they  would  not  urge  their
         relatives to assist the appellant once he arrived and  put  him  in
         touch with them."

       . He would not lose contact these family in the UK  although  it  was
         accepted that contact will not be so close.  Modern  communications
         would enable them to provide support and encouragement from the  UK
         and they could  visit  him  in  Pakistan.  They  had  maintained  a
         relationship with him during  the  significant  period  he  was  in
         custody. They could do so again, even over the greater geographical
         distance.

       . The appellant is educated to secondary level and her  skills  as  a
         plumber  and  in  security;  those  skills  could  be  deployed  to
         facilitate his integration into Pakistan.

       . He follows the Islamic faith which is widely followed  in  Pakistan
         and by his family;

       . he is not suffering from depression and does not  have  any  health
         issues which would act as a very significant obstacle.

54. The judge found that exception 1 (section 117C  (4))  could  not  apply
    because he needed to meet all three conditions (a)-(c).  He  could  not
    meet condition (c) for the reasons set out above.

55. The Judge considered  whether  the  appellant  could  demonstrate  very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described in Exceptions 1
    and 2.

56. The judge set out the law at paragraphs 54 - 56 and making reference to
    the decision of the Supreme Court in Hesham Ali.

57. He identified the following factors which gave  weight  to  the  public
    interest in the deportation of the appellant:

       . the appellant is not presently financially independent (S117C (1))

       . Parliament has expressed its view  clearly  -  the  deportation  of
         foreign criminals is in the public interest (Section 117C (1))

       . the appellant's offences are very  serious  in  nature  and  number
         (S117C (2))

       . exception 1 does not apply in the appellant's  case  (section  117C
         (4))

       . the appellant accepts that exception 2 does not apply in  his  case
         (section 117C (5)).

58. On the appellant's side of the scales the FtTJ identified the following
    factors st paragraph [58]:

       . He has been resident in the UK for all 28 years of  his  life  save
         the first 14 months;

       . his residence had been lawful

       . he would have been entitled to British citizenship had he chosen to
         apply

       . he was socially and culturally integrated into the UK

       . those factors above contributed considerable weight to his claim

       . he can speak English (section 117B (2))

       . he might become financially independent

       . his parents and siblings are in the UK,  as  are  his  friends  and
         associates.

59. At paragraphs 59 - 61 the judge weighed very carefully all the factors;
    the public interest factors against the factors contributing weight  to
    the appellant's Article 8 claim and had not treated anyone factor as  a
    "trump card" but reached the conclusion that he  had  not  demonstrated
    that there were "very compelling circumstances" to outweigh the  public
    interest  given  that  the  public  interest  in  deportation  in   the
    appellant's case is "clear and powerful". His claim, whilst it did have
    weight and strength did not have  sufficient  strength  and  weight  to
    outweigh the clear and powerful public interest in his deportation.

The legal framework

60. There is no dispute as to the legal  framework  that  applies  to  this
    appeal.

61. The Secretary of State's power to deport non-UK nationals derives  from
    section 3 (5) of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended), which reads, so
    far as material:

         "A person who is not a British Citizen  is  liable  to  deportation
         from the United Kingdom if -

             (a)  the Secretary  of  State  deems  his  deportation  to  be
             conducive to the public good; or

             (b)  ..."

62. The UK Borders Act 2007 provides for a regime governing the deportation
    of non-nationals who are convicted in  the  UK  of  criminal  offences.
    Section 32 reads, so far as material, as follows:

         "(1) In this section "foreign criminal" means a person -

             (a)  who is not a British citizen,

             (b)  who is convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and

             (c)  to whom Condition 1 or 2 applies.

         (2)  Condition 1 is that the person is sentenced  to  a  period  of
         imprisonment of at least 12 months.

         (3)  ...

         (4)  For the purpose of section 3 (5) (a) of  the  Immigration  Act
         1971 ..., the deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the
         public good.

         (5)  The Secretary of  State  must  make  a  deportation  order  in
         respect of a foreign criminal (subject to section 33).

         (6) - (7) ..."

63. Section 33, as referred to in section 32  (5),  contains  a  number  of
    exceptions to the obligation on the  respondent  to  deport  a  foreign
    criminal. On this appeal only Exception 1 is relevant, which,  by  sub-
    section  (2),  applies  "where  removal  of  the  foreign  criminal  in
    pursuance  of  the  deportation  order  would  breach  (a)  a  person's
    Convention rights, or (b) ...".

64. The consideration by a court or tribunal of  whether  a  decision  made
    under the immigration legislation is in breach of  the  rights  of  any
    person under article 8 is subject to the provisions of Part 5A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which was  introduced  by
    the Immigration Act 2014 with effect from 28 July  2014.  Section  117A
    (2) provides  that  in  considering  whether  an  interference  with  a
    person's right  to  respect  for  their  private  and  family  life  is
    justified under article 8 (2)

         "the court or tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

             (a)  in all cases, to the  considerations  listed  in  section
             117B, and

             (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
             to the considerations listed in section 117C".

65. Section 117B reads:

         "(1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
         public interest.

         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to-

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom."

66.  Section 117C reads:

         "(1)  The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be  taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted."

67. The deportation of foreign criminals is the subject of Part 13  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Its  core  provisions  -  paragraphs  398-399A  are
    replicated in substance by those of section 117C (3)-(6).

    Paragraph 398 reads as follows:

         "Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary  to
         the  UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the   Human   Rights
         Convention, and

         (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

         (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months;
         or

         (c)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good and in the public interest because, in the view of  the
         Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm or they
         are a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for  the
         law,

         the Secretary of  State  in  assessing  that  claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the
         public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A."

68. We need not set out paragraph 399 since it is concerned with  the  case
    where the person facing deportation has a partner or  a  child.  It  is
    common ground that the appellant is a single man with no children.

    Paragraph 399A reads:

         "This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if-

         (a)  the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most  of
         his life; and

         (b)  he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

         (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
         into the country to which it is proposed he is deported.

69.  On the facts of this  appeal,  the  appellant  has  been  convicted  of
    offences for which he received a sentence in  excess  of  4  years  and
    therefore the public interest requires his deportation unless there are
    very compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above  those  described  in
    Exceptions 1 and 2.

The appeal before the Upper Tribunal:

70.  Mr Alam of Counsel appeared on behalf of the appellant and  Mr  Lindsay
    on behalf of the respondent. When permission was granted by  Designated
    Judge Shaerf on 29 June 2018 he granted permission on the proviso  that
    at the error  of  law  hearing,  the  appellant's  solicitors  must  be
    prepared to substantiate the allegations made.

71.  In compliance with those directions a bundle was  filed  on  5  October
    2018 which included  the  grounds  for  permission  but  importantly  a
    witness statement from the appellant's sister,  and  other  documentary
    evidence. We note that in that bundle there was  no  witness  statement
    from the appellant himself although there was a letter at page 21. This
    did not make any explicit reference to any procedural unfairness.

72.  A further bundle of documents was sent to the Tribunal by way of  email
    on the afternoon of 10 June 2019 comprising of medical records, witness
    statement and a list of courses attended by the  appellant.  Given  the
    lateness of this material, Mr Lindsay confirmed that he  had  not  seen
    that material and nor had Mr Alam. Copies were therefore made for  each
    of the advocates and they were given the opportunity to consider  them.
    Although they  were  not  served  and  filed  in  accordance  with  the
    directions, given the issues that were  under  consideration,  we  were
    satisfied that we should admit them as part of the evidence.

73.  At the outset of the hearing Mr Alam told us that he  was  not  seeking
    to call any oral evidence in respect of the allegation made against the
    appellant's former legal representatives. However, he reconsidered this
    and made an application that we should  hear  oral  evidence  from  the
    appellant's sister relevant to the  issue  raised  in  ground  one.  We
    acceded to that request because we  considered  that  where  procedural
    fairness is an issue, the parties should be  entitled  to  provide  any
    evidence in support.

The evidence of H:

74. We therefore heard oral evidence from H who the appellant's sister.  As
    previously directed, she had  provided  a  witness  statement  dated  5
    October 2018 at [AB16]. Mr Alam confirmed that he relied on  the  first
    seven passages of the witness statement which he said went to the issue
    of procedural unfairness. She adopted the contents of that statement as
    her evidence in chief after having had the opportunity to reread it and
    confirm the accuracy of its contents. No further questions  were  asked
    in chief.

75. We summarise that statement as  follows.  The  witness  confirmed  that
    Malik Law Chambers represented the appellant at the hearing before  the
    FtT but that they did not consult the appellant, her mother or  her  in
    drafting the witness statements and that  during  the  time  that  they
    represented the appellant, they were never contacted or  asked  provide
    evidence (see paragraph 2).

76. In respect of the witness statement it was said that those  which  were
    drafted by MLC contained inaccurate information "having no  input  from
    us except some general notes" which she had sent  when  they  had  been
    appointed.

77. At paragraph 3 the following was stated "the evidence we have  now  was
    not submitted in  the  FtT  hearing  as  Malik  Law  did  not  maintain
    communication  and  did  not  liaise  with  me  at  all.  I  maintained
    communication, but my input and help were not used."

78. At paragraph 4, the witness made reference to calling the solicitors on
    their landline, that she would be on hold 20 minutes and then the  line
    would cut off automatically and this would  happen  daily.  She  stated
    that they refused to provide her with their mobile numbers and most  of
    the time would not reply to the emails.  She  also  made  reference  to
    visiting the office was told that the solicitor was busy with a client.

79. At paragraph 5 she makes reference to the material that was  inaccurate
    in the witness statement and referred to the fact that it was said that
    the appellant could not speak his mother tongue which is Urdu which was
    incorrect.

80. At paragraph 6 she set out the both her and a mother were asked to sign
    the witness statements and to email them back a few  hours  before  the
    FTT hearing. The appellant did not sign the witness statement as he was
    in prison.

81. At paragraph 7 she refers to "what was previously missing from the  FtT
    hearing was information about his mental  health,  his  sexuality,  the
    appellant's mother's health information and information about relatives
    and Pakistan.

82. She was cross-examined by the presenting officer. She was asked if  the
    appellant was represented  by  a  barrister  at  the  hearing  and  she
    confirmed that he was and gave the barrister's name.

83. As to the circumstances in which the witness statement was signed,  she
    accepted that she had signed the witness statement (as being true)  but
    stated that she was told to sign and send it back. When  asked  if  she
    had signed a witness statement on the same day as the hearing, she said
    "I signed the witness statement the previous day." When it was  put  to
    her that this was inconsistent with her witness statement and that  she
    had said that she had signed with this statement on the day before  the
    hearing, she changed her evidence and stated that she  had  signed  the
    witness statement later in the afternoon on the day before.

84. When asked if Counsel had asked similar  questions  about  the  witness
    statement, she stated "he asked us about  the  witness  statements  and
    read it and we were very happy because there was incorrect  information
    there; it said he couldn't speak Urdu and that was incorrect." She  was
    asked to state at what point she had told Counsel of  the  inaccuracies
    and the witness stated, "just before the hearing and he discussed this,
    and we told him we were not happy  with  the  witness  statement."  She
    confirmed in evidence that she had informed Counsel of her  unhappiness
    with the witness statement outside court before the hearing.  She  also
    stated that she was given the chance to  amend  the  witness  statement
    when giving evidence. When asked to state what Counsel had said to  her
    when she had told him that she was unhappy,  the  witness  replied  "he
    said he would discuss it with the judge, and I think he  asked  if  the
    appellant could speak Urdu".

85. When  asked  if  Counsel  had  said  that  they  should  apply  for  an
    adjournment she stated "no, he went ahead, and we  gave  evidence."  It
    was put to her that after she had given the chance to amend her witness
    statement that she must have told the judge that the evidence that  she
    relied upon was correct and complete and she replied "yes".

86. As to problems of giving instructions, it was put to her  that  as  the
    appellant  was  the  client  of  MLC,  they  would   necessarily   take
    instructions from him and not  her  unless  the  appellant  provided  a
    letter to say that she was acting for him. In reply to this, she stated
    that as he was imprisoned, she was acting on behalf  of  him,  but  she
    confirmed in her evidence that she had nothing to  say  in  writing  or
    otherwise to state that she was acting for him.

87. In re-examination, Mr Alam referred  to  a  document  page  25  of  the
    appellant's bundle which was a letter addressed to  the  appellant  but
    sent "care of" to the appellant's sister.

88. No further oral evidence was called.

89. We are grateful to the submissions we heard from Mr Alam and Mr Lindsay
    on the issues that arise in the  grounds  advanced  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant. We confirm that we  have  considered  those  submissions  in
    accordance with the skeleton arguments produced and the  grounds  which
    had been filed before the Upper Tribunal. We further  confirm  that  we
    have given full consideration to those submissions which we heard,  and
    we intend to incorporate those submissions into our analysis of the two
    grounds that are relied upon by the appellant.

Ground 1: procedural unfairness:

90.  The  first  ground  is  that  of  procedural  unfairness.  Whilst  the
    submission made by Mr Alam referred to  procedural  unfairness  at  the
    hearing of the appellant's appeal, in reality this submission was based
    on procedural fairness on the  basis  that  it  is  asserted  that  the
    appellant  was  badly  served  by  his  previous  representatives   and
    accordingly he did not have a fair hearing.

91. Mr Alam submitted that in the context of this appellant's hearing,  the
    procedural fairness point related to the ability of the appellant being
    able to present his case fairly. He submitted that the  evidence  given
    by the appellant's sister was that the solicitors  instructed  had  not
    advised them correctly concerning the submission of relevant documents,
    including the witness statements, and  because  of  their  incompetency
    there was evidence that was not taken into account.

92. In respect of the witness statements, they had not been consulted  when
    the statements were  finalised  and  had  been  sent  to  the  FtT  and
    therefore they did  not  include  all  the  relevant  information.  The
    appellant had not seen or signed a statement before it was sent to  the
    FtT and that the witness statements were sent to the appellant's sister
    and mother the day before the hearing, which they signed and then  sent
    back.

93. In his submissions he  identified  that  the  issues  included  matters
    relating to the appellant's depression, the mother's medical  condition
    and the appellant's rehabilitation. He further submitted that they were
    relevant to the issue of "compelling circumstances".

94. In respect of the appellant's depression, he submitted that it was  one
    of the main  issues  before  the  FtT  as  identified  in  the  judge's
    determination at paragraph 21 and that it was the appellant's  evidence
    and that of his family members, that he suffered  from  depression.  He
    submitted that this was a relevant point  when  looking  at  compelling
    circumstances, for example, that the appellant may have been  depressed
    when committing the offence.  He  submitted  that  his  depression  was
    referred to in the statement of additional grounds (and in the  grounds
    of appeal) but that despite that, they  did  not  seek  to  advise  the
    appellant to seek medical  evidence  to  support  his  claim.  He  made
    reference to the new bundle of evidence which  included  medical  notes
    from the prison hospital which made reference  to  his  suffering  from
    depression.

95. He made reference  to  the  evidence  of  the  appellant's  sister  and
    submitted that she had  given  credible  evidence  in  respect  of  the
    circumstances and her dealings with the solicitors and the attempt that
    she had made to contact them.  He  further  submitted  that  the  whole
    argument proceeded on the basis  that  the  appellant  and  the  family
    members were not given the opportunity to produce appropriate  evidence
    or documents that were necessary to present their case.

96. Mr Alam did not produce a copy of the decision of the President  in  MM
    (unfairness; or the E and R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 105 but relied upon  the
    summary set out in the grounds at paragraphs 7 to 9 and in the skeleton
    argument which stated as follows;

         "Mr Justice McCloskey in the judgement of  MM  on  the  subject  of
         procedural fairness amounting to errors of law considered  the  key
         question of whether an appealable error of law can arise through no
         fault on the part of the judge held as follows:

      1. where there is a defect or impropriety of a  procedural  nature  in
         the proceedings at first instance,  this  may  amount  to  material
         error of law requiring the decision of the first-tier  Tribunal  to
         be set aside.

      2. A successful appeal is not dependent on the demonstration  of  some
         failing on the part of the FTT. Thus, an error of law may be  found
         to have occurred in circumstances  where  some  material  evidence,
         through no fault of the  FTT  was  not  considered  with  resulting
         unfairness (E and R v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 49."

97. He submitted that in the decision  of  MM,  neither  party  included  a
    letter sent to the respondent which was  central  in  establishing  the
    appellant's credibility to the First-tier Tribunal.  He  reiterated  in
    his submissions that when applied to this case, it was not the fault of
    the FtTJ but that that did not matter and that the point emphasised was
    that the judge's conduct of the hearing was  not  to  be  evaluated  by
    reference to a test of reasonableness or  fault  but  that  common  law
    fairness is of a quite distinct hue and unfairness is not dependent  on
    demonstrating either.

98. He therefore invited us to find that there was a material error of  law
    in the decision of the FtTJ and whilst it had arisen through  no  fault
    on the part of the judge, it was sufficient to set aside  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal.

99. Mr Lindsay on behalf of the Secretary of  State  submitted  that  there
    were a number of evidential deficiencies in the submissions made, which
    when taken together, would mean that the appellant's  claim  failed  on
    the ground of procedural fairness.

100. Firstly, he identified that there was  no  evidence  from  Counsel  who
    would been instructed in the form of a witness statement  or  even  the
    disclosure of his record of proceedings and given  the  seriousness  of
    the allegations raised and in the context of  the  witnesses  evidence,
    that the deficiencies were discussed prior to the hearing, the  absence
    of the evidence alone was fatal to the appellant's case.

101. He submitted that the oral evidence of the witness  was  that  she  had
    notified Counsel and that she had been given a suitable opportunity  to
    amend the witness statement and  to  confirm  to  the  judge  that  her
    evidence as amended was correct and complete and in those circumstances
    it was not open to the appellant to allege that  there  was  procedural
    unfairness. There was not even a bare assertion from the appellant that
    he had no such opportunity.

102. Secondly, he identified that there was no  admissible  evidence  as  to
    why MLC had been shut down and importantly there was no  evidence  that
    any of the legal representatives involved had been behaving dishonestly
    on behalf of this appellant.

103. Thirdly,  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  appellant's  sister  was
    authorised to act on the appellant's behalf and the letter at  page  25
    of the bundle did not assist in establishing this issue.

104. Furthermore, even following the directions there was no  evidence  that
    pre- dated the FtT hearing which established  that  the  appellant  was
    suffering from depression. He submitted that even at the  date  of  the
    hearing, the material  showed  that  the  records  were  printed  on  2
    November 2018 and the earliest date of the records is  31  August  when
    the hearing took place  in  April  2018.  The  records,  he  submitted,
    reflected what the appellant had told them. He submitted that the judge
    was aware of the issue  and  properly  and  fairly  dealt  with  it  at
    paragraph 31.

105. At its highest, the witness's assertion at paragraph 17 is that he  had
    been anxious for the last four years but does  not  say  that  she  was
    aware before the FtT that he had depression and thus at its highest  it
    was an assertion in the witness statement and she accepted that she had
    said everything she wanted to say before the FtTJ.  He  submitted  that
    even taken at its highest, the  appellant's  witness  stated  that  the
    issue of the medical report was something that  the  solicitors  should
    have told him about but there is no assertion that the solicitors  told
    him that they did not need to obtain such evidence. In  any  event  the
    appellant could have sought an adjournment via Counsel.

106. We have considered those submissions  in  the  light  of  the  relevant
    legal principles identified by Mr  Alam  in  the  decision  of  MM  (as
    cited). There can  be  no  dispute  that  when  considering  procedural
    fairness amounting to an error of law, such errors can arise through no
    fault on the part  of  the  judge  and  that  a  successful  appeal  is
    therefore not dependent on the demonstration of  some  failing  on  the
    part of the judge and thus an  error  of  law  may  be  found  to  have
    occurred  in  circumstances  where  some  material  evidence  was   not
    considered with resulting unfairness.

107. The following principles of procedural fairness were distilled  by  the
    President in MM from the decision of the Court of Appeal in R  v  Chief
    Constable of Thames Valley police ex parte Cotton [1990] IRLR:

         "(1) The defect, or impropriety,  must  be  procedural  in  nature.
         Cases of this kind  are  not  concerned  with  the  merits  of  the
         decision under review  or  appeal.  Rather,  the  superior  court's
         enquiry focuses on the process, or procedure, whereby the  impugned
         decision was reached.

         (2)  It is doctrinally incorrect to adopt the two-stage process  of
         asking whether there was a procedural irregularity  or  impropriety
         giving rise to unfairness and, if so, whether this had any material
         bearing on the outcome. These are, rather, two elements of a single
         question, namely whether there was procedural unfairness.

         (3)  Thus,  if  the  reviewing  or  appellate  Court  identifies  a
         procedural irregularity or impropriety which, in its view, made  no
         difference to the outcome, the appropriate conclusion is that there
         was no unfairness to the party concerned.

         (4)  The reviewing or appellate Court should  exercise  caution  in
         concluding that the  outcome  would  have  been  the  same  if  the
         diagnosed procedural irregularity or impropriety had not occurred."

108. We also remind ourselves of the decision  in  Azimi-Moayed  and  others
    (decisions affecting children; onward appeals)  [2013]  UKUT  197(IAC).
    The facts of that decision are not material, but the Tribunal  set  out
    the following:

         "x)  The amended  grounds  do  not  criticise  the  judge  for  his
             handling of the  case  and  reveal  no  basis  for  doing  so.
             Although it is an error of law  if  there  has  been  no  fair
             hearing, it will normally be through disputed decisions of the
             judge that a complaint of unfairness arises.

         xi)   Although  we  do  not  rule  out  that  unfairness  could  be
             established through the incompetence of the advocate, there is
             a high threshold to establish. It is not sufficient  that  the
             advocate exercised forensic judgment that  the  appellant  now
             disagrees with or has subsequently proven to  be  unfortunate.
             Some regard may be relevant to the test in the Court of Appeal
             Criminal Division where conduct by the advocate is  relied  on
             as a ground to challenge the safety  of  the  conviction  (see
             Archbold 2012 7-83). Although  the  criminal  courts  are  now
             concerned primarily with the impact  of  the  failure  of  the
             advocate on the trial  process,  there  must  be  demonstrated
             incompetence such as a course of  action  that  no  reasonable
             advocate would have taken.  The  allegations  against  counsel
             appearing on 30 March nowhere reached that standard.

         xii) Just as in criminal appeals, if the appellant mounts criticism
             of a representative, legal privilege must be expressly  waived
             and draft statements and conference notes relevant to the case
             should be disclosed. This was not done in the present case. We
             have no explanation for the differences in account and why the
             appellant behaved as he did at the appeal and what he intended
             to say if any different from what the judge  recorded  him  as
             saying. In any  event,  where  credibility  is  in  issue  his
             complaint  may  not  carry  weight  if  it   is   evidentially
             unsupported.

         xiii)    Where fresh evidence such as  medical  evidence  comes  to
             light after the hearing, this should normally be the basis  of
             fresh representations rather than support an error of  law  in
             an otherwise properly determined appeal."

109. It is against that background  that  we  have  considered  the  written
    grounds and the submissions advanced by  Mr  Alam.  The  basis  of  the
    argument based on  procedural  fairness  consists  of  two  complaints,
    firstly the way in which the solicitors prepared the witness statements
    which included preparing them without consulting the  authors  of  them
    and not including all the relevant information and secondly, failing to
    advise the appellant that he was  required  to  seek  medical  evidence
    about his depression. The grounds at paragraph 6 describe that evidence
    as a "determinative factor in the appellant's appeal."

110. We observe in respect of the second issue, that there  is  no  evidence
    before the Tribunal from the appellant by way of a witness statement in
    support of that allegation or  any  of  the  matters  which  have  been
    alleged.

111. Dealing with the first complaint, we have given  careful  consideration
    to the oral evidence that we have heard from the appellant's sister but
    having considered the witness statement and its  contents,  we  do  not
    conclude that there has been no  consultation  or  instructions  taken,
    given its contents and the substantial grounds of  appeal,  upon  which
    reliance is placed by Counsel during this hearing.

112. We accept that the witness statements were  sent  unsigned  before  the
    signed copies, which formed the second bundle before the FtTJ (we refer
    to paragraph 10  of  the  decision).  However,  we  do  not  find  that
    paragraph 4 of the grounds is consistent with the oral evidence of  the
    appellant's sister. It is asserted there  that  the  parties  were  not
    given the  opportunity  to  disagree  with  parts  of  the  information
    included in the witness  statements.  That  is  contrary  to  the  oral
    evidence that we have heard. The witness stated that she  had  informed
    Counsel before the hearing of the problems  and  informed  him  of  the
    incorrect information (relating  to  language)  and  it  was  discussed
    outside  of  the  courtroom.  Her  evidence  was  that  after  she  had
    identified a problem with  the  witness  statement,  she  was  given  a
    suitable opportunity to amend that  and  confirmed  to  the  judge  the
    evidence that was contained in it was then correct.  This is consistent
    with the judge's  determination  at  [23]  in  which  he  recorded  the
    evidence as to language and that whilst in  the  written  evidence  the
    appellant stated that he did not speak any Pakistani language and  that
    his sister  stated  that  he  did  not  speak  any  Pakistani  language
    fluently, both departed from those  assertions  in  their  evidence  in
    chief. It is also consistent with the record of proceedings produced by
    Mr Lindsay from the presenting  officer  in  attendance  where  it  was
    recorded "the appellant and sister gave evidence in English, his mother
    in Urdu. This necessitated  the  amendment  of  their  various  witness
    statements."

113. We are also satisfied  that  paragraph  2  of  the  grounds  appear  to
    misstate the effect of the amendment of the witness statement.  In  the
    light of the evidence of the appellant's witness, who stated  that  she
    identified prior to the hearing that there  was  incorrect  information
    about the appellant's language ability and accepted  that  she  had  an
    opportunity to amend the witness  statement  before  the  hearing,  she
    confirmed that it was amended at the stage of proceedings  when  giving
    evidence in chief. It  is  therefore  not  been  established  that  any
    alleged misconduct gave rise to the  judge's  finding  that  there  was
    inconsistent evidence.

114. Consequently, we do not find that it is  been  established  that  there
    was any procedural unfairness given that  the  appellant's  sister  was
    given the opportunity to amend the witness statement in relation to the
    issue of language and in fact did so, and it appears that the appellant
    was also given a similar opportunity. We do observe however that  there
    has been no evidence given on behalf of the appellant and as Mr Lindsay
    submitted, there is not even a bare assertion  made  by  the  appellant
    that he had no such opportunity.

115. Mr Alam sought to rely on other issues. He identified that  information
    concerning the appellant's mother's ill-health was missing. However, in
    the appellant's mother's witness statement  the  effect  of  her  son's
    deportation was set out at both paragraphs  8  and  paragraph  10.  The
    witness statement of the appellant's sister at paragraphs 14, 21 and 24
    all make reference to the negative impact on the appellant's mother who
    was being described as "frail and anxious" and that "her suffering  and
    had an impact on the whole family".

116. As to the issue of the appellant's depression, Mr Alam  submitted  that
    this was an  important  issue  and  one  that  it  been  identified  at
    paragraph 21 of the FtT's decision and had been set out  by  the  legal
    representatives in the grounds of appeal that the appellant had "mental
    issues" and was supported in the UK by his family.

117. We have considered the contents of the witness statements and  contrary
    to the assertion that they do not set out the  relevant  matters,  both
    the witness statements of the appellant and that  of  his  mother  make
    reference to depression and mental health at paragraphs 16 (appellant's
    witness statement) and paragraphs 11 and 12  of  his  mother's  witness
    statement.

118. In the light of the oral evidence where the  witness  stated  that  she
    and her brother were given  the  opportunity  to  amend  their  witness
    statements, further oral evidence could have been provided. In the case
    of the appellant, the determination  records  that  he  did  give  oral
    evidence concerning his depression and at paragraph 31, his evidence to
    the judge was that he was not taking any medication for his  depression
    and the medical material in the bundle J1 - J3 did  not  refer  to  any
    diagnosis  of  depression  or  any  prescription  for  medication.  The
    material referred to by the judge consisted of a patient  summary  from
    the hospital prison and under "active major  problems"  no  information
    was recorded. At J1 it was  recorded  that  he  was  currently  not  on
    prescribed medication (dated 2 November 2017).  Therefore, the evidence
    before the judge both historically and at the date of the hearing,  was
    consistent-that the appellant was not taking  any  medication  for  his
    depression, if that had indeed been  diagnosed.  The  judge  also  made
    reference to the psychiatric report at [31]  which  revealed  that  the
    appellant was addicted to gambling and  carried  out  the  offences  to
    frighten staff into handing over the money. We have not  been  provided
    with a copy of that report, but no submissions have been made that that
    report made reference to any depression. It is likely that  the  report
    was commissioned as a result of the appellant having committed offences
    of  robbery  which  are  specified  offences  and  would  require   the
    sentencing judge to consider the issue of  dangerousness.  However,  we
    can make no further comment upon that report.

119. Mr Alam has sought to rely upon new evidence which is set  out  in  the
    bundle sent yesterday to the Tribunal. Despite the late service of  the
    material, we admitted it into evidence  in  the  light  of  the  issues
    raised.  However, we accept the submission made by Mr Lindsay that  the
    material relates to recent complaints of depression and anxiety and are
    recorded from August 2018. None of that evidence predates  the  hearing
    nor can it be said to allude to the circumstances either  prior  to  or
    contemporaneously at the time of the hearing. At page 5 of those notes,
    there is reference to the appellant not being  on  any  medication  and
    that he had not been prescribed anything in the past including from his
    GP, which is both supportive and consistent with the evidence given  by
    the appellant to the FtTJ.

120. We remind ourselves that there  is  a  high  threshold  for  complaints
    about the incompetence of previous  representatives  (see  decision  in
    Azimi-Moayed) It is in this context that notwithstanding what  we  have
    set out above, we are  satisfied  that  there  are  further  evidential
    difficulties which the appellant has not addressed.

121. Firstly, we have been  provided  with  no  evidence  from  Counsel  who
    represented the appellant at the hearing. As submitted by  Mr  Lindsay,
    it is unusual, given the circumstances of the procedural unfairness  as
    alleged, that there is no evidence that  Counsel  had  been  approached
    provide a witness statement as to the  events  or  had  been  asked  to
    disclose any record of the proceedings  that  he  had.  That  has  more
    importance given the witness's evidence that she had  told  him  before
    the hearing about any difficulties  and  that  no  application  for  an
    adjournment was made.

122. Secondly,  there  is  the  absence  of  any  evidence  from  Malik  Law
    Chambers. In the decision of BT (Former solicitors' alleged misconduct)
    Nepal [2004] UKIAT 00311 at paragraph 5 the Tribunal stated:

         "5.  We wish to make it clear that, in general, we will not make  a
             finding  of  fact  based  on  an  allegation  against   former
             representatives unless, first, it is  clear  that  the  former
             representatives have been given an opportunity to  respond  to
             the allegation which is being  made  expressly  or  implicitly
             against them, and secondly, we are either shown  the  response
             or shown correspondence which indicates that there has been no
             response".

123. We accept that Malik Law Chambers have been closed  down  and  thus  it
    would be difficult to obtain evidence from the solicitors or  for  them
    to be given the opportunity to respond to the allegation.  However,  as
    we have set out above, there  is  no  evidence  from  Counsel  who  was
    instructed by them to act on behalf of the appellant.

124.  Furthermore, and perhaps of more importance, there is  an  absence  of
    any evidence as to why MLC was closed down. We  accept  the  submission
    made by Mr Lindsay that the  assertion  in  the  skeleton  argument  at
    paragraph  7  entitled  "reasons  for  SRA  intervention"  which  makes
    reference to "reasons to suspect dishonesty on the part  of  the  firms
    managers in connection with the firms business", has not been supported
    by any further evidence and there is no indication that either of those
    persons identified were involved in the appellant's case.  Even  if  we
    were to accept that they did  represent  the  appellant,  there  is  no
    evidence that any legal representative behaved dishonestly on behalf of
    this appellant.

125. Whilst we have  no  copies  of  any  correspondence  sent  between  the
    appellant's sister and the solicitors, we have no reason to  disbelieve
    the evidence given by her when she stated that she had been ringing the
    solicitors and sending  them  emails.  However,  we  have  viewed  that
    complaint in the context of the position that there is no evidence that
    the  appellant's  sister  was  authorised  to  act  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant. Whilst we accept that he has been in prison as a  result  of
    his offending since December 2016, there is no written evidence, either
    a copy of any letter sent to  the  solicitors  or  from  the  appellant
    himself, to demonstrate that his sister was acting or considered to  be
    acting formally on his behalf. When  assessing  her  evidence  and  her
    complaint that MLC did not take instructions from  her  and  that  they
    were "hard to get hold of", that evidence is  equally  consistent  with
    the solicitors not discussing the case with her personally as  she  was
    not their client. They were not acting for the appellant's  sister  but
    for the appellant.

126. Mr Alam has submitted that there is support for the appellant's  sister
    acting on his behalf and has directed us to page 25 of the  appellant's
    bundle. However, that document does not support his submission. This is
    a letter sent from solicitors acting from the appellant in his personal
    injury claim, (an event that post-dated the  hearing  by  a  number  of
    months). It is sent to a C/o "care of" address but it is  addressed  to
    the appellant himself. Mr Lindsay asked us to take judicial notice that
    a letter sent c/o is a document sent to an address but  the  letter  is
    still addressed to the person whose name is on the letter and  that  it
    does not give any authority for any other person to open the letter  or
    to give instructions on it. Whether or not we take judicial  notice  of
    that fact, the letter is addressed to the appellant. In the absence  of
    evidence and based on the evidence from the witness which  was  to  the
    effect that she could not recall signing anything and there is  nothing
    from the appellant to state that  he  did,  the  burden  being  on  the
    appellant to adduce evidence, we cannot be satisfied that it  has  been
    demonstrated that the appellant's sister was acting on his behalf.

127. There have been other  issues  that  have  been  raised  in  a  witness
    statement filed by the appellant's sister. Whilst it makes reference to
    certain information that is missing from the FtT hearing, it  is  plain
    from the letter exhibited at page 21 from the appellant that  this  had
    not been disclosed to anyone prior to the FtT hearing in April 2018 and
    thus does not support any procedural unfairness based  on  the  alleged
    misconduct of the appellant's former representatives.

128. Drawing together all of those factors, we have reached  the  conclusion
    that the appellant's principle ground falls short of establishing  that
    there was procedural unfairness.

Ground 2:

129. The second ground advanced on behalf of the appellant  relates  to  the
    FtTJ's assessment of the evidence relating to a number of issues.

130. It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the  FtTJ's  assessment
    is marred by his own judgement  that  the  offences  committed  by  the
    appellant were "plainly very serious". It is further submitted that  in
    this  respect  the   FtTJ's   findings   are   marred   by   irrelevant
    considerations as set out in paragraph 37  (see  paragraph  14  of  the
    written grounds in paragraph 20 the skeleton argument).

131. We have considered that submission  in  the  context  of  the  evidence
    before the FtTJ. The judge addressed the offences and their seriousness
    at paragraphs 33 - 37 of his decision. In light of the particular facts
    of the offences committed as set out  in  the  sentencing  remarks  and
    replicated in part at  paragraphs  34  and  35  of  the  decision.  The
    offences committed were offences  of  robbery,  attempted  robbery  and
    possession of an imitation firearm at the time of committing  offences.
    We conclude that the FtTJ's assessment of the offences as "plainly very
    serious" properly reflected that evidence.

132. It is further asserted that the judge took into account  an  irrelevant
    consideration when stating at paragraph 37 that had the  appellant  not
    pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity his  sentence  would
    been somewhere around  nine  years.  It  is  submitted  that  this  was
    irrelevant to the FtTJ's consideration as  the  appellant  had  pleaded
    guilty. However, that was  a  statement  of  fact  which  was  entirely
    correct. We are satisfied that the reference made formed  part  of  the
    general factual background and it has not been  demonstrated  that  the
    reference  made  formed  any  material  part  of  his   assessment   of
    proportionality. It did not add anything more to the FtTJ's  assessment
    that the offences were "plainly very serious" and assessment  which  on
    the particular facts of this appeal was open to him. There is no  error
    demonstrated in this approach.

133. It is further submitted on behalf of the appellant that the FtTJ  erred
    in law by failing to make a clear finding on  a  core  element  of  the
    appellant's appeal which related to whether there were very significant
    obstacles to his reintegration to  Pakistan.  In  this  context  it  is
    submitted that the judge found there to be some contact with family  in
    Pakistan when considering this issue but then went on to  say  at  [46]
    "even if I was incorrect  and  the  appellant  himself  does  not  have
    contact with his family in Pakistan his mother and sister, HR,  are  in
    contact with their relatives." It is submitted that the judge failed to
    make a clear finding as to whether the appellant had contact  with  his
    family in Pakistan which was central to the issue  of  integration  and
    that whether or not the appellant's mother and sister  are  in  contact
    with the family, that is irrelevant to the appellant's own integration.
    It is the submitted that it was the appellant's own ties that were  the
    relevant consideration in the assessment of proportionality of removal.

134. The FtTJ's reasoning on this issue set out at paragraphs  41  -  52  of
    its decision. To reach his conclusion  he  applied  the  definition  of
    integration as set out in the decision of The Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813 which cited to him  by
    counsel on behalf of the appellant. The grounds replicate the  relevant
    paragraphs that decision.

135. It was in this context that the judge that out  a  number  of  relevant
    features by reference to the evidence, including his language [44], his
    education and employment skills [48], his religion [49] and his  health
    [50].

136. As to family links, they were considered at paragraphs 45 - 47  of  the
    decision. In our judgement, the FtTJ did make clear findings of fact as
    to the retention of family links in Pakistan. There is no dispute  that
    the appellant had extended family members living in Pakistan  and  this
    was reflected in the evidence at paragraphs 24 -  27.  The  appellant's
    maternal grandmother and grandfather, and two maternal uncles lived  in
    Pakistan. The appellant's mother was in contact with  her  parents  and
    had some contact with her brothers and the appellant's sister was  said
    to be in contact with her maternal grandmother every month or  so  (see
    paragraph 27).

137. At paragraphs 28 - 29, the FtTJ set out the appellant's evidence  where
    he asserted that he had no connections with Pakistan. However the judge
    concluded from the evidence that his sister's explanation as to why she
    had contact with relatives in Pakistan, but the appellant did not,  was
    not a sufficient explanation. He recalled also that the  appellant  did
    not offer an explanation himself in evidence (see [29)). It is recorded
    that his mother gave evidence which stated that he had  no  connections
    at all.

138. It is against that background and in  the  absence  of  a  satisfactory
    explanation and having found that the  appellant's  sister  and  mother
    were in contact with their relatives,  the  judge  concluded  that  the
    appellant had not demonstrated that he did not have  contact  with  the
    maternal family in Pakistan. This is a clear finding made by the  judge
    and one that was evidenced-based. This led to the FtTJ's assessment  at
    paragraph 45 that the appellant had family in Pakistan and that he had,
    at least, some contact with them.  The FtTJ then applied  that  finding
    to the applicable test and stated "they will be able to devise a system
    so that he can be enough of an insider to have a reasonable opportunity
    to be accepted in Pakistan. The guidance will assist the  appellant  to
    build up in a reasonable time a variety of  human  relationships,  over
    and above relationships with his family in Pakistan, to give  substance
    to his private and family life. He will have  contacts  on  arrival  in
    Pakistan. I recognise that his grandparents are 89  years  of  age  and
    that they have  mobility  issues.  They  will  not  need  to  assist  a
    relatively fit and healthy young man physically."

139. The finding at [46] was a finding in the alternative and  that  if  the
    FtTJ's assessment was wrong (that is, the appellant himself did have no
    contact with his relatives) that the appellant's mother and sister, who
    the judge found to be in contact with the  extended  family,  would  be
    able to assist in this regard. He found that "it is inconceivable  that
    they would not urge their relatives to assist  the  appellant  once  he
    arrived and put him in touch with them."

140. We therefore conclude that the FtTJ did make a clear  finding  on  this
    issue which was based on the evidence given  to  the  Tribunal  by  the
    parties. The FtTJ had the opportunity of hearing the evidence from  the
    parties involved and made findings of fact based on that  evidence.  We
    find no error as asserted in the grounds.

141. The thrust of the second ground relates to the  assessment  of  whether
    there  were  very  compelling  circumstances"  over  and  above   those
    described in Exceptions 1 and 2". Mr Alam submits that  when  assessing
    the appellant's right to respect the family and private life, the  FtTJ
    was under duty to assess whether expulsion was justified under  Article
    8 (2) and that the FtTJ's conclusion at [60] "that the public  interest
    in deportation in the appellant's case is clear and powerful" failed to
    give adequate consideration to the strength of the appellant's  private
    and family life in the United Kingdom.

142. In his submissions, Mr Alam submitted that  the  FtTJ  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for reaching the conclusion that there  were  no  very
    compelling circumstances in this appellant's case.

143. He identified the relevant factors as being the length of residence  in
    the UK since the age of 14 months and  that  he  had  not  returned  to
    Pakistan save for a short visit in 2014 and that the judge had  reached
    the conclusion on the evidence that the appellant  was  culturally  and
    socially integrated in the UK. Other factors  included  those  at  [57]
    which included that the appellant's residence was lawful  and  that  he
    would have been entitled to British citizenship had he chosen to apply.
    Against that background it is submitted that the judge failed  to  have
    regard to the "very serious" reasons required to justify  expulsion  as
    set out in the ECHR decision of Maslov v Austria [2008] ECHR 546.

144. Mr Lindsay submitted that the  judge  properly  set  out  the  relevant
    factors which he recorded at paragraph [57]  and  that  the  judge  was
    aware of the chronology of the  case  and  the  length  of  his  lawful
    residence in the United Kingdom therefore there was  no  error  in  the
    FtTJ's approach.

145.  It is not in dispute that on the facts of this appeal,  the  appellant
    has been convicted of offences for which  he  received  a  sentence  in
    excess of 4 years  and  therefore  the  public  interest  requires  his
    deportation unless there are very compelling  circumstances,  over  and
    above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.

146. The approach which tribunals should adopt was  helpfully  described  by
    Hickinbottom LJ giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Secretary
    of State for the Home Department v KE (Nigeria) [2017] EWCA  Civ  1382,
    at [30] to [36]:

         "30. The statutory provisions in sections 117A-117D are law (cf the
         Immigration Rules: see Ali at [17]). However, both section 117C and
         the relevant Immigration Rules set out policy, in  the  sense  that
         they provide a general assessment of the  proportionality  exercise
         that has to be performed under article 8(2) where there is a public
         interest in deporting a foreign criminal but countervailing article
         8 factors. The force of the  assessment  in  section  117C  is,  of
         course, the greater  because  it  directly  reflects  the  will  of
         Parliament. The statutory provisions thus provide  a  "particularly
         strong statement of public policy" (NA (Pakistan)  at  [22]),  such
         that "great weight" should generally be given to it  and  cases  in
         which that public interest will be  outweighed,  other  than  those
         specified in the statutory provisions and  Rules  themselves,  "are
         likely to be a  very  small  minority  (particular  in  non-settled
         cases)" (Ali at [38]), i.e. will be rare (NA (Pakistan) at [33]).

         31.   But  the  required,  heavily  structured  analysis  does  not
         eradicate all judgment on the part of the  decision-maker  and,  in
         its turn, the court or tribunal on any challenge to that  decision-
         maker's decision. It is well-established, and indeed  self-evident,
         that relative human rights (such as the right to respect for family
         and private life under article 8) can only ultimately be considered
         on the facts  of  the  particular  case.  The  structured  approach
         towards  the  article  8(2)  proportionality   balancing   exercise
         required by the  2002  Act  and  the  Immigration  Rules  does  not
         determine the outcome of the assessment in an individual case.

         32.  Whether an exception in  paragraph  399  or  399A  applies  is
         dependent upon questions  that  require  case-specific  evaluation,
         such as whether in  all  of  the  circumstances  it  would  not  be
         reasonable for a child to leave the United Kingdom  or  whether  in
         all of the circumstances  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to
         family life outside the United Kingdom.

         33.  More importantly for the purposes of  this  appeal,  where  an
         offender has been sentenced to at least four  years'  imprisonment,
         or otherwise falls outside the paragraph 399 and  399A  exceptions,
         the decision-maker, court or tribunal entrusted with the task  must
         still consider  and  assess  whether  there  are  "very  compelling
         circumstances" that justify a departure from the general rule  that
         such offenders should be deported  in  the  public  interest.  That
         requires the decision-maker to take into  account,  not  only  that
         general assessment (and give it the weight appropriate to  such  an
         assessment  made  by  Parliament),   but   also   the   facts   and
         circumstances of the particular  case  which  are  not  -"  indeed,
         cannot -" be taken into account in any general assessment. As  Lord
         Reed, giving the majority judgment, said in Ali:

             "49. ... It is necessary to feed into the analysis  the  facts
             of the particular case and the criteria which are  appropriate
             to the context, and, where a court is reviewing  the  decision
             of another authority, to give such weight to the  judgment  of
             that authority as may be appropriate. In  that  way,  relevant
             differences between, for example, cases where lawfully settled
             migrants are facing deportation or expulsion, and cases  where
             an alien is seeking admission to a host country, can be  taken
             into account.

             50.  In summary, therefore, the tribunal carries out its  task
             on the basis of the facts as  it  finds  them  to  be  on  the
             evidence before it, and the law as established by statute  and
             case law. Ultimately, it has to decide whether deportation  is
             proportionate in the particular case before it, balancing  the
             strength of the public interest  in  the  deportation  of  the
             offender against the impact on private  and  family  life.  In
             doing so, it should give appropriate  weight  to  Parliament's
             and the Secretary of State's assessments of  the  strength  of
             the general public interest  in  the  deportation  of  foreign
             offenders..., and also consider all factors  relevant  to  the
             specific case in question. The critical issue for the tribunal
             will generally be whether, giving due weight to  the  strength
             of the public interest on deportation of the offender  in  the
             case before it, the article 8 claim is sufficiently strong  to
             outweigh it. In general, only a claim  which  is  very  strong
             indeed -" very compelling, as it was put in [MF (Nigeria)]  -"
             will succeed."

             See also [53] to similar effect.

         34.  Therefore, as Lord Reed emphasises, whatever  the  seriousness
         of the offences or length of sentence, the ultimate question is the
         same -" would deportation be in breach of  article  8  -"  but  the
         sentence imposed affects the approach to the exercise of  assessing
         proportionality for article 8(2) purposes. If it is at  least  four
         years'  imprisonment,   any   decision-maker   must   attach   very
         considerable  weight  to  the  general  assessment  of  the  public
         interest in deporting foreign criminals, now  directly  adopted  by
         Parliament in statute, under which such  a  sentence  represents  a
         level of offending in respect of which the public  interest  almost
         always outweighs countervailing considerations of private or family
         life, only being outweighed by  countervailing  factors  which  are
         very compelling (see Ali at [46]). Where there is a challenge to  a
         decision  involving  the  article  8(2)  balancing  exercise  by  a
         decision-maker on behalf of the Secretary of State in an individual
         case, as I have already described, the court or tribunal must  give
         that general assessment substantial weight, because it is  endorsed
         by Parliament; and it must also take into account -"  but  no  more
         than  take  into  account  -"  the  application  of  that   general
         assessment to the facts  of  the  specific  case  by  the  original
         decision-maker (OH (Serbia) at [15(d)]).  As  independent  judicial
         bodies, on hearing a challenge  to  an  executive  decision  in  an
         individual case, it is the duty of the court or  tribunal  to  make
         its own findings of the  relevant  facts  and  then  make  its  own
         assessment of the proportionality of the proposed deportation  (Ali
         at [46]).

         35.  Since Ali, the 2014  Act  has  intervened,  encapsulating  the
         relevant  Government  policy  in   statute   rather   than   merely
         Immigration Rules. However, in my view, the principles and approach
         expounded by Lord Reed still apply; although,  in  considering  the
         appropriate weight to be given the assessment of  the  strength  of
         the  general  public  interest  in  the  deportation   of   foreign
         offenders, any decision-maker, court  or  tribunal  conducting  the
         article 8(2) exercise  has  to  bear  in  mind  that  that  is  now
         incorporated into statute, and so, even more starkly, reflects  the
         will of Parliament."

147. In NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 662, the Court of Appeal gave guidance on the  application  of
    section 117A(6), "where the public interest requires deportation unless
    there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those described
    in Exceptions 1 and 2". Jackson LJ, giving the judgment  of  the  Court
    said:

         "29. In our view, the reasoning  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  JZ
         (Zambia) applies to those provisions. The phrase  used  in  section
         117C (6), in para. 398 of the 2014 rules and which we have held  is
         to be read into section  117C(3)  does  not  mean  that  a  foreign
         criminal facing deportation is altogether disentitled from  seeking
         to rely on matters falling within the scope  of  the  circumstances
         described in Exceptions 1 and 2 when seeking to contend that "there
         are very compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described
         in Exceptions 1 and 2". As  we  have  indicated  above,  a  foreign
         criminal is entitled to rely upon such matters, but he  would  need
         to be able to point to features of his case of a kind mentioned  in
         Exceptions 1 and 2 (and in paras. 399 or 399A of the  2014  rules),
         or features falling outside the circumstances  described  in  those
         Exceptions and those paragraphs, which  made  his  claim  based  on
         Article 8 especially strong.

         30.  In  the  case  of  a  serious  offender  who  could  point  to
         circumstances in his own case which could be said to correspond  to
         the circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and  2,  but  where  he
         could only just succeed in  such  an  argument,  it  would  not  be
         possible to describe his situation  as  involving  very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2. One might describe that as a bare case of the kind described  in
         Exceptions 1 or 2. On the other hand, if he could point to  factors
         identified in  the  descriptions  of  Exceptions  1  and  2  of  an
         especially compelling kind in support of an Article 8 claim,  going
         well beyond what would be necessary to make out a bare case of  the
         kind described in Exceptions 1  and  2,  they  could  in  principle
         constitute "very compelling circumstances,  over  and  above  those
         described in Exceptions 1 and 2", whether taken by themselves or in
         conjunction with other factors relevant to application  of  Article
         8.

         31.  An interpretation of  the  relevant  phrase  to  exclude  this
         possibility would lead to violation of Article  8  in  some  cases,
         which plainly was not Parliament's intention. ...

         ...

         33.   Although  there  is  no  'exceptionality'   requirement,   it
         inexorably follows from the statutory  scheme  that  the  cases  in
         which circumstances are sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh  the
         high public interest in deportation will be rare.  The  commonplace
         incidents of family life, such as ageing parents in poor health  or
         the  natural  love  between  parents  and  children,  will  not  be
         sufficient.

148. In MS the President of the Upper Tribunal, Lane J (sitting in  a  panel
    with UTJs Gill and Coker) considered the correct approach to s. 117C(6)
    with the benefit of the guidance provided in KO (Nigeria) v SSHD [2018]
    UKSC 53 and NA (Pakistan) (supra), and said this:

         "16. By contrast, the issue of whether "there are  very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2" is not in any sense a hard-edged question. On the  contrary,  it
         calls for a wide-ranging  evaluative  exercise.  As  NA  (Pakistan)
         holds, that exercise is  required,  in  the  case  of  all  foreign
         criminals, in order  to  ensure  that  Part  5A  of  the  2002  Act
         produces, in each such case, a result that is compatible  with  the
         United Kingdom's obligations under Article 8 of the ECHR.

         17.  Viewed in  this  light,  it  can  readily  be  seen  that  the
         ascertainment of what constitute "very  compelling  circumstances",
         such as to defeat the public  interest,  requires  a  case-specific
         analysis of the nature of the public interest. The strength of  the
         public interest, in any particular case, determines the weight that
         must then be found to lie on the foreign  criminal's  side  of  the
         balance in order for the circumstances to be  properly  categorised
         as very compelling. It would, frankly, be remarkable  if  a  person
         sentenced to four years' imprisonment for fraud had to  demonstrate
         the same circumstances as a person sentenced to  life  imprisonment
         for multiple murders.

         18.  To say this is not to seek to introduce a "balancing exercise"
         into Exceptions 1 and 2 and the test of "unduly harsh".  The  words
         "over and above", as interpreted by Jackson LJ  in  NA  (Pakistan),
         underscore the difference in the tasks  demanded  by,  on  the  one
         hand, section 117C (4) and (5) and, on the other, section 117C (6).

         19.  Furthermore, as Mr Pilgerstorfer pointed out,  the  effect  of
         the judgment in NA (Pakistan), in bringing  all  foreign  criminals
         within the ambit of section 117C(6), means that it is difficult  to
         see how the test  of  very  compelling  circumstances  can  operate
         differently, depending upon whether the foreign  criminal  has,  or
         has not, been sentenced to imprisonment of at  least  4  years.  In
         order for it to do so, yet further words would have to  be  assumed
         to be written into the section, over and above  those  mandated  by
         the Court of Appeal's judgment.

         20.  For these reasons, despite Ms Patyna's elegant submissions, we
         find the effect of section 117C is that a  court  or  tribunal,  in
         determining whether there are  very  compelling  circumstances,  as
         required by subsection (6), must take into account the  seriousness
         of the particular  offence  for  which  the  foreign  criminal  was
         convicted,  together  with  any  other  relevant  public   interest
         considerations.  Nothing  in  KO  (Nigeria)  demands   a   contrary
         conclusion."

149. The  wide-ranging  evaluative  exercise  required  under  s.  117C  (6)
    clearly includes an application of the  principles  in  the  Strasbourg
    authorities.  As NA (Pakistan) holds,  the  s.  117C  (6)  exercise  is
    required to  ensure  compatibility  with  the  UK's  obligations  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  In addition, the  judgment  in  NA  (Pakistan),
    given by Jackson LJ, reads:

         "29. ... The phrase used in section 117C (6), in para. 398  of  the
         2014 ... does not mean that a foreign criminal  facing  deportation
         is altogether disentitled from seeking to rely on  matters  falling
         within the scope of the circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and
         2  when  seeking  to  contend  that  'there  are  very   compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2'. ... [A] foreign criminal is entitled to rely upon such matters,
         but he would need to be able to point to features of his case of  a
         kind mentioned in Exceptions 1 and 2 (and in paras. 399 or 399A  of
         the 2014 rules), or  features  falling  outside  the  circumstances
         described in those Exceptions and those paragraphs, which made  his
         claim based on Article 8 especially strong.

         30.  In  the  case  of  a  serious  offender  who  could  point  to
         circumstances in his own case which could be said to correspond  to
         the circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and  2,  but  where  he
         could only just succeed in  such  an  argument,  it  would  not  be
         possible to describe his situation  as  involving  very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2. One might describe that as a bare case of the kind described  in
         Exceptions 1 or 2. On the other hand, if he could point to  factors
         identified in  the  descriptions  of  Exceptions  1  and  2  of  an
         especially compelling kind in support of an Article 8 claim,  going
         well beyond what would be necessary to make out a bare case of  the
         kind described in Exceptions 1  and  2,  they  could  in  principle
         constitute 'very compelling circumstances,  over  and  above  those
         described in Exceptions 1 and 2', whether taken by themselves or in
         conjunction with other factors relevant to application  of  Article
         8."

150. In Maslov (supra), the Grand Chamber said this:

         "71. In a case like  the  present  one,  where  the  person  to  be
         expelled is a young adult who has not yet founded a family  of  his
         own, the relevant criteria are:

           - the nature and seriousness of the  offence  committed  by  the
             applicant;

           - the length of the applicant's stay in the country  from  which
             he or she is to be expelled;

           - the time elapsed since  the  offence  was  committed  and  the
             applicant's conduct during that period;

           - the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the host
             country and with the country of destination.

         72.  The Court would also  clarify  that  the  age  of  the  person
         concerned can play a role when applying some of the above criteria.
         For instance, when assessing the  nature  and  seriousness  of  the
         offences committed by an applicant, it has to be taken into account
         whether he or she committed them as a juvenile or as an adult (see,
         for instance, Moustaquim v. Belgium, judgment of 18 February  1991,
         Series A no. 193, p. 19, � 44,  and  Radovanovic  v.  Austria,  no.
         42703/98, � 35, 22 April 2004).

         73.  In turn, when assessing the length of the applicant's stay  in
         the country from which he or she is to be expelled and the solidity
         of the social, cultural and family ties with the host  country,  it
         evidently makes a  difference  whether  the  person  concerned  had
         already come to the country during his or her childhood  or  youth,
         or was even born there, or whether he or she only came as an adult.
         This tendency is  also  reflected  in  various  Council  of  Europe
         instruments,   in   particular   in    Committee    of    Ministers
         Recommendations Rec (2001)15 and Rec (2002)4 (see paragraphs  34-35
         above).

         74.  Although Article 8 provides  no  absolute  protection  against
         expulsion for any category of aliens (see �ner, cited above, � 55),
         including those who were born in the host country or moved there in
         their early childhood, the Court has already found that  regard  is
         to be had to the special situation of aliens who have  spent  most,
         if not all, their childhood in the host country,  were  brought  up
         there and received their education there (see �ner, � 58 in fine).

         75.  In short, the Court considers that for a settled  migrant  who
         has lawfully spent all or the major part of his  or  her  childhood
         and youth in the host country very serious reasons are required  to
         justify expulsion. This  is  all  the  more  so  where  the  person
         concerned committed the offences underlying the  expulsion  measure
         as a juvenile."

151. Having considered the decision of the FtTJ in the light  of  the  legal
    principles set out above, we are satisfied that the judge  carried  out
    an assessment as to whether the appellant could meet Exception  1,  and
    this is reflected in his consideration of the factual circumstances. He
    found that the appellant had been lawfully in the UK for  most  of  his
    life [58], that he was culturally and socially integrated in the UK (at
    [38 - 40]) and he considered that he had been in the  UK  lawfully  for
    nearly all of his 28 years and that he been educated  both  at  primary
    and secondary level and undertaken employment in the  UK.  He  rejected
    the respondent's argument that his convictions meant that  he  was  not
    socially or  culturally  integrated.  However,  in  the  light  of  his
    findings at [41 - 51] he did not find that there were very  significant
    obstacles to his reintegration and therefore  he  could  not  meet  the
    three conditions necessary under section 117 C (4).

152. He  then  went  on  to  consider  whether  he  could  demonstrate  very
    compelling circumstances over above those set out in Exception 1.

153. In his assessment he made reference  to  the  "balance-sheet  approach"
    and one which is commended in a number of decisions (see Hesham Ali  at
    [84] and AS v SSHD EWCA Civ 417 at [16]17]) and  set  out  the  factors
    weighing in the public interest and those weighing on  the  appellant's
    side. Whilst we are satisfied that he set out the factors that  he  had
    previously found in the  appellant's  favour,  there  is  no  reference
    within the balancing exercise to any assessment or recognition  of  the
    Maslov criteria. His conclusion  at  [59]  makes  reference  to  having
    weighed carefully the factors involved but there is no  recognition  of
    the "very serious reasons" required to justify the expulsion of someone
    who was a settled migrant who had spent all of his childhood and  youth
    and adult years in the host country (save for a period of  14  months).
    As recognised in the ECHR case law, such a settled  migrant  will  have
    ties with the community that constitute part of the  concept  of  their
    private life and whilst there is no absolute protection, a balance  has
    to be struck with a proper appreciation of  the  special  situation  of
    those who have lived in the host country since childhood.

154. In addition, this appellant could also rely  on  an  additional  factor
    which related to his ability to apply for  British  citizenship.  While
    the judge made reference to this in the balance, there was no  analysis
    of how that related to  the  appellants  factual  chronology  (see  the
    decision in Akinyemi v SSHD [2017] EWCA  Civ  236)  and  therefore  the
    relative weight that merited.

155. A further issue identified  in  the  grounds  and  relied  by  Mr  Alam
    relates to the assessment of family life with his mother and  siblings.
    It is submitted that the  FtTJ  failed  to  consider  the  relationship
    between the appellant and his other relatives (his mother and siblings)
    and whether this amounted to family life the purposes of Article 8  (1)
    of the ECHR. The appellant's case was that he had grown  up  without  a
    father and had established a very strong bond with his  mother  and  it
    been accepted by the respondent that  the  appellant,  his  mother  and
    siblings that had  to  leave  the  matrimonial  home  due  to  domestic
    violence when the appellant was at a very young  age.  It  is  asserted
    that there was financial dependence on the appellant by his mother.  It
    is not clear to us how there could be  financial  dependence  upon  the
    appellant given his offending history, but the  issue  of  family  life
    between the appellant, his mother and siblings was an issue raised both
    in the witness statements filed by the appellant and the family members
    notwithstanding the earlier submissions made that the statement did not
    adequately reflect the appellant's case.

156. Furthermore, in the skeleton argument provided for the hearing  it  was
    expressly raised as an issue paragraph 12 (b) and by reference  to  the
    written material.

157. Whilst the appellant's family members gave evidence  before  the  FtTJ,
    there is no reference to any assessment of that issue. We cannot accept
    the submission made by Mr Lindsay that the H gave  evidence  before  us
    that she had had the opportunity to say all she had  wished  to  before
    the FtTJ, adequately addressed this issue. There is no assessment  made
    as to the establishment of any  family  life.  We  recognise  that  the
    appellant is over the age of 18 years, but it is common ground that the
    appellant had remained living with his family members  beyond  reaching
    that age and in the context of the  background  that  it  is  said  was
    accepted by the respondent. We further recognise that when  considering
    relationships between adults what is required is a  demonstration  that
    there are circumstances which go beyond normal emotional ties. However,
    on the face of the evidence, that was the claim  advanced.  In  a  case
    which did  not  include  lawful  long  residence  as  set  out  on  the
    particular facts of this case, such consideration may not be viewed  as
    material to the outcome. However,  as  this  was  a  further  balancing
    factor which was not addressed in the overall  proportionality  balance
    and not a factor set out in the  "balance-sheet"  approach  and  was  a
    relevant issue and linked to the  issue  of  his  social  and  cultural
    integration and his lawful residence. Whilst  a  settled  migrant  will
    have ties to the community and to the family which constitute  part  of
    the concept  of  private  life,  we  recognise  there  is  no  absolute
    protection on that basis from expulsion but a balance has to be  struck
    with a proper appreciation of the special situation  of  those  in  the
    host country since childhood and we  are  satisfied  that  that  factor
    alongside with the issue relating to family life are factors which  may
    have an effect  on  the  overall  balance,  dependent  on  the  factual
    assessment made.

158. We  are  therefore  satisfied  that  those  errors  as  identified  are
    material to the outcome as they are relevant to the balancing  exercise
    and in this case whether there were "very compelling circumstances".

159. In the ordinary course of events, we would  consider  the  evidence  on
    the issues and remake the decision ourselves. However, for the  reasons
    we have referred to earlier in this decision, there is further evidence
    which the appellant would seek to rely upon including evidence relating
    to his mental health and the necessary  findings  in  relation  to  the
    issue of family  life  which  we  have  identified.  In  addition,  the
    appellant, it is said, has made a protection claim to  the  respondent.
    We have no details as to what is happened in this  respect.  For  those
    reasons, we reach the conclusion  that  the  decision  to  dismiss  the
    appeal should be set aside and should  be  reheard  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. We do so on the basis that the findings of  fact  made  which
    relate to his social and cultural integration into the UK at 38  -  40,
    the findings as to whether there are very significant obstacles to  his
    integration  at  paragraphs  41  -  49  are  findings  which  shall  be
    preserved. In addition, further findings will be necessary relating  to
    issues of mental health and family life.

160. Whilst we have made an anonymity direction at this  stage,  whether  it
    should be continued can be further addressed  before  the  FtT  in  the
    light of any representations made.

Notice of Decision
