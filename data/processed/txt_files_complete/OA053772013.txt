For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Martin, instructed by Nag Law Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO). However, for  the
   purposes of this decision, I shall refer to the ECO as the respondent and
   Mr Kumarawaduge as the appellant, reflecting their positions as they were
   in the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

2. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka,  born  on  22  August  1986.  He
   applied for entry clearance  as  a  partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
   immigration rules, in order to settle in  the  United  Kingdom  with  his
   wife. His application was refused on 30 January 2013, solely with respect
   to the rules relating to the financial requirements of Appendix FM, under
   paragraphs EC-P.1.1(d) and E-ECP.3.1 of Appendix FM. The  respondent  was
   satisfied that the relationship between the appellant and  his  wife  was
   genuine, noting that his wife had recently given birth  to  their  child,
   and that he met the accommodation and English  language  requirements  of
   the rules. The respondent noted that the appellant was relying on  income
   from his wife's employment to  confirm  her  gross  income  of  at  least
   �18,600 per annum as required  under  the  rules.  With  respect  to  the
   specified evidence required under Appendix  FM-SE  the  respondent  noted
   that the appellant had not provided bank statements with his  application
   and his wife had provided only five months of  payslips.  Accordingly  he
   had failed to show that his application met the financial requirements of
   the rules.

3. The  appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  and  enclosed  further
   evidence  with  his  grounds  of  appeal,  including  his   wife's   bank
   statements, P60 and payslips and a letter from her employer.

4. The application was then reviewed by an  Entry  Clearance  Manager  (ECM)
   who conceded, in the light of the additional payslip submitted, that  the
   requirements of paragraph 2(a) of FM-SE had been  met.  However  the  ECM
   maintained the refusal decision on the grounds that the  bank  statements
   did not correspond to the same period as the payslips and that they  were
   not in the correct format since they were online statements.

5. The appellant's appeal against that decision was heard in the  First-tier
   Tribunal on  25  November  2013.  It  was  conceded,  on  behalf  of  the
   respondent, that the bank statements provided in the respondent's  appeal
   bundle corresponded with the  formal  bank  statements  provided  in  the
   appellant's bundle. The original documents were produced at the  hearing.
   The judge found that the  appellant  had  met  the  requirements  of  the
   immigration  rules  and  allowed  the  appeal,  noting  also   that   the
   appellant's case fell squarely within the principles in  MM,  R  (On  the
   Application Of) v The Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2013]
   EWHC 1900.

6. Permission to appeal against that decision was sought by  the  respondent
   on the grounds that the judge had failed  to  explain  how  the  payslips
   complied with the rules of specified evidence and  what  level  of  gross
   income was received by the sponsor; and that he had failed to explain how
   the principles in MM applied to the appellant.

7. Permission was granted on 27 January 2014 on the grounds raised.

Appeal hearing

8. At the hearing Mr  Avery  agreed  that  he  was  in  some  difficulty  in
   supporting the grounds of appeal on the basis upon which  they  had  been
   drafted. He conceded that the ECM was wrong in considering that the  bank
   statements did not cover the same period as the  payslips:  they  clearly
   did. He was unable to confirm whether or not the bank statements  in  the
   appellant's appeal bundle had been before the ECM  although  he  accepted
   that the judge's determination confirmed that it had been agreed that the
   statements in the respective appeal bundles corresponded with each other.

9. Mr Martin submitted that the bank statements had been before the ECM  and
   the judge  had  accordingly  been  entitled  to  allow  the  appeal.  His
   determination was short, but that was because there  had  been  agreement
   between the parties at the hearing.

Consideration and findings.

10.  The respondent's grounds  of  appeal  are  plainly  misconceived:  they
   assert that the judge had failed to consider how the  sponsor's  payslips
   complied with the rules of specified evidence and  what  level  of  gross
   income the sponsor received, but those were not matters in  dispute.  The
   sponsor's employment and level of income, as confirmed by  her  employer,
   had never been challenged  by  the  respondent  as  such.  There  was  no
   question  of  the  sponsor's  credibility  in  that  regard  or  of   the
   reliability of the documentary evidence. The payslips had  been  accepted
   by the ECM. The basis for the application being refused was  simply  that
   the financial documents produced in relation to the sponsor's employment,
   specifically her bank statements, were not in the format required by  the
   rules. Accordingly Mr Avery accepted that he was in  some  difficulty  in
   supporting the grounds of appeal.

11. With regard to the format of the  documents,  the  ECM  was  plainly  in
   error in concluding that the sponsor's bank statements produced with  the
   Notice of Appeal did not cover the same period as her payslips, when they
   clearly did. The respondent's appeal bundle contains a copy of those bank
   statements, covering a period from 23 January 2012 to 23 September  2012,
   which clearly correspond to the payslips accepted by the ECM as  covering
   the required six month period, from 23 March 2012 to 23 August 2012.

12. The only  remaining  issue,  therefore,  was  the  format  of  the  bank
   statements. There is  no  dispute  that  the  sponsor's  bank  statements
   contained in the appellant's appeal bundle before the First-tier Tribunal
   complied with the requirements of Appendix FM-SE as regards their format.
   It was agreed on behalf of the respondent that those bank statements were
   an accurate reflection of the bank statements in the respondent's  appeal
   bundle which had been produced to the ECM together  with  the  Notice  of
   Appeal. The sponsor claims that the bank statements  in  the  appellant's
   appeal bundle were before the ECM and Mr Avery was not in a  position  to
   dispute (or confirm) that that was the case. Judge Fox  plainly  accepted
   that they were and it was for that reason that his determination  was  so
   short. It seems to me that  he  was  perfectly  entitled  to  reach  that
   conclusion. In any event, I find nothing in the  format  of  the  NatWest
   headed bank statements contained in the  respondent's  appeal  bundle  to
   suggest that they were not sufficient to meet  the  requirements  of  the
   specified documents in Appendix FM-SE.

13. Accordingly, Judge Fox was entitled to conclude that the  appellant  had
   provided the required documentary evidence to confirm the sponsor's gross
   annual income of �26,000 and to conclude that he had therefore been  able
   to meet the requirements  of  paragraphs  EC-P.1.1(d)  and  E-ECP.3.1  of
   Appendix FM. His reference to  the  principles  in  MM  did  not  form  a
   material part of his reasoning and the grounds of appeal in that  respect
   are not of relevance. He was entitled to allow the appeal  on  the  basis
   that the requirements of the immigration  rules  had  been  met  and  his
   decision does not contain any errors of law requiring it to be set aside.

DECISION

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error of law. I do  not  set  aside  the  decision.  The
   decision of the First-tier Tribunal, to allow Mr  Kumarawaduge's  appeal,
   therefore stands.

15. The Entry Clearance Officer's appeal is accordingly dismissed.
