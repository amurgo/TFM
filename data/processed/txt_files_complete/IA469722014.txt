                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal brought with permission of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Ransley from the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Pedro which
    was promulgated on 9 December 2015.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Nepal born in 1987 and  she  appeals  the
    decision of the respondent to refuse to vary her leave to remain in the
    United Kingdom. The issue has very  much  narrowed  in  the  course  of
    argument before me this morning.

3.   Under the provisions of the Immigration Rules, appendix FM-SE,  it  was
    necessary for the appellant to  demonstrate  that  the  required  gross
    annual income of her spouse exceeded the prescribed limit  of  �18,600.
    The judge having reviewed  the  evidence  came  to  the  conclusion  in
    paragraph 13 that "the appellant's spouse's  income  fell  considerably
    short of this figure".

4.   The judge correctly  looked  at  this  matter  using  the  figures  and
    documentation as at the date of the application as opposed to the  date
    of  the  hearing.  The  judge's  determination  was  sufficient  to  be
    dispositive of the appeal in its totality.

5.   Rather confusingly, the judge went on to consider the case  as  at  the
    date of the hearing on the alternative basis that gross  annual  income
    level would be �22,400, because by this stage a child  had  been  born.
    The judge fell into error, however, in not appreciating that the  child
    was a British national and in  those  circumstances  the  lower  figure
    would still have prevailed.

6.   This error on the judge's part, however, is not material.  The  correct
    finding at paragraph 13 was sufficient to dispose of the matter in  its
    entirety and the subsequent discussion which is found in paragraph  14,
    though wrong, was not relevant to the outcome.


Notice of Decision
The appellant's appeal is dismissed  and  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal Judge is affirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
