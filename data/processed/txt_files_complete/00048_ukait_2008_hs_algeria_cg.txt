Where there are grounds for believing that a returnee may be suspected by
the Algerian authorities of having been involved in terrorist activity
abroad, he may be at real risk on return in the absence of specific
assurances from the Algerian government and/or monitoring by the British
Embassy in Algiers.  The risk arises from the time that he may spend in the
custody of the DRS (D�partement du Renseignment de la Securit� ) while his
background is investigated.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, born 13 February 1955, is  a  citizen  of  Algeria.   He
    claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom in July 2000 when  he  was
    granted entry as a visitor, having been issued with  a  visit  visa  in
    Tunis on 12 July 2000.  On 23 January 2001 the appellant claimed asylum
    after having been detained by the police as an overstayer.

 2. The appellant claimed asylum on the basis that he feared persecution if
    returned to Algeria arising from death threats  he  had  received  from
    unknown persons.  He claimed that his involvement in establishing a new
    teaching union and the fact that he had taught English at  an  Algerian
    school had placed him in danger.

 3. On 22 March 2001 the Secretary of State refused the  appellant's  claim
    for asylum and by a notice dated 30 March 2001  issued  directions  for
    his removal from the United Kingdom to Algeria.  The appellant lodged a
    notice of appeal against those decisions additionally claiming that the
    United  Kingdom  would  breach  its  obligations  under  the   European
    Convention if he were removed to Algeria.

 4. In September 2002 the appellant  was  arrested  by  the  anti-terrorist
    branch of the Metropolitan  police  and  was  eventually  convicted  of
    conspiracy to defraud on 2 July 2004.  He was sentenced to  two  years'
    imprisonment  and  recommended  for  deportation.   That  sentence  was
    completed and he was subsequently detained under the Immigration  Acts.



 5. On 22 December 2004 the Immigration Appeal Tribunal accepted  that  the
    appellant and representative had not received the notice of the  appeal
    hearing which had been dismissed in his absence  on  3  February  2003.
    The remitted appeal was heard as a  reconsideration  appeal  after  the
    coming into being of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in April 2005.
     That reconsideration appeal was heard together with the appeal against
    the respondent's decision to deport the appellant following the court's
    recommendation.

 6. Following a panel hearing at Taylor  House  on  21  September  2005,  a
    single determination was promulgated covering both the  reconsideration
    and the appeal against deportation on 16 February 2006  dismissing  the
    appeal on both asylum and human rights grounds.

 7. On 18 January 2007 the Court of Appeal allowed  by  consent  an  appeal
    against the dismissal of an asylum and human rights appeal and  ordered
    a full de novo reconsideration of all the issues.  Thus the matter came
    before us at Field House on 19 November 2007.  The hearing  lasted  for
    two days although no oral evidence was heard because facts relating  to
    the appellant were not in dispute.  The sole issue was risk on  return.
    Both representatives addressed us.  The unfortunate delay  between  the
    hearing and the promulgation of the determination was a combination  of
    waiting for confirmation from the Treasury Solicitors as to  the  issue
    of whether or not the appellant would be returned with  assurances  and
    also operational difficulties at Field House.  It is noteworthy that no
    oral and monitoring evidence was heard.

Submissions

 8. Ms Webber on behalf of the appellant reminded us that the terms of  the
    remittal from the Court of Appeal left open all issues relevant to  the
    asylum and human rights appeal, albeit that the merits  of  deportation
    per se were not in themselves arguable.

 9. Ms Webber reminded  us  that  the  issue  before  us  was  whether  the
    appellant faced a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment contrary to
    Article 3 of the ECHR if returned now to Algeria possibly, sufficiently
    serious harm to justify Humanitarian Protection.   Her  submission  was
    that because of his profile, in particular as a result of the  interest
    shown in him by the anti-terrorist branch of  the  Metropolitan  police
    together with the widespread media coverage of the conviction  and  the
    public speculation regarding the reason for the offences, namely  as  a
    means of raising funds for terrorist activities, he would be at risk of
    identification as a potential terrorist  on  return  to  Algeria.   She
    further submitted that his associations and  affiliations  with  others
    convicted of similar terrorist motivated offences would  place  him  at
    risk.

10. In her helpful skeleton argument Ms Webber analysed  the  risk  to  the
    appellant as to whether or not he would be perceived  by  the  Algerian
    authorities as a terrorist or at least someone  supporting  terrorists.
    Furthermore if so perceived, whether that profile exposed him to a real
    risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.

11. Ms Webber accepted on behalf of the appellant that there  was  no  real
    risk of ill-treatment to the appellant on his return as a failed asylum
    seeker or deportee.  The risk was related to his  perceived  activities
    leading to conviction of fraud offences in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    result of the  investigations  of  the  anti-terrorist  branch  of  the
    Metropolitan police force.

12. Ms Webber relied on the fact that there had been public coverage of the
    police view that the conspiracy for which the appellant was  eventually
    convicted was an operation to raise  funds  for  terrorist  activities.
    She also prayed in aid the fact that the  continuing  interest  in  the
    appellant by the anti-terrorist branch following his conviction, as set
    out in the bail summary opposing the grant of bail,  put  him  at  real
    risk of harm.  Also his perceived links to international terrorism  and
    armed groups in Algeria because of his association  with  co-defendants
    known to the Algerian authorities as terrorists exacerbated the risk.

13. Ms Webber drew to our attention the BBC online  news  report  dated  24
    November 2004 which reported the criminal  prosecution.   The  headline
    indicated that a gang of Algerian asylum seekers had  been  jailed  for
    their role in a High Street fraud which had netted  at  least  �800,000
    "possibly for terrorism".  The article had stated:

           "The gang was  caught  after  enquiries  by  the  Anti-Terrorist
           branch backed by Special  Branch  National  Terrorist  Financial
           Investigation Unit".


    Although money had not been traced the spokesman on behalf of  Scotland
    Yard had spoken of  their  suspicion  that  the  money  had  been  sent
    overseas "to fund terrorist activities."



14. The bail summary document, which reflected  the  respondent's  concerns
    about the appellant, stated:

           "September 2003, the subject was arrested by the Anti  Terrorism
           Branch of the Metropolitan Police.  He  is  later  charged  with
           conspiracy to defraud after his part in a complex conspiracy  to
           defraud banks  is  uncovered.   ...  It  is  believed  that  the
           proceeds of this fraud were being routed back out of the  UK  as
           their lifestyles were wholly incommensurate with the proceeds of
           the crime."


    It further stated that:


           "His known associates and co-defendants in the recent conspiracy
           trial are all known to the Anti Terrorism authorities.  Although
           he was  charged  with  and  sentenced  for  deception  his  case
           remained under the control of the Anti Terrorism Branch."


15. The links with international terrorism groups in Algeria through the co-
    defendants, were referred to in particular on  a  BBC  news  report  of
    Wednesday 24 November 2004 which inter alia stated:


           "The gang was  caught  after  enquiries  by  the  Anti-Terrorist
           branch, backed by Special Branch's National Terrorist  Financial
           Investigation Unit."


    Indicating that the fraud had involved hundreds of  bank  accounts  and
    scores of bogus identities, it further stated  that  the  �800,000  was
    believed to have been diverted abroad  via  bank  accounts  in  France,
    Finland and the Irish Republic.


16. Ms Webber relied on the fact that the appellant's conviction for  fraud
    in November 2004 had featured prominently in the media and  the  police
    view that the money obtained was likely to have been funnelled overseas
    to fund  terrorist  activities  had  been  stressed  in  these  various
    accounts in the press.

17. In addition to the BBC report quoted above, Ms Webber also relied  upon
    an article in the Telegraph on 25 November  2004  which  described  the
    convictions thus:

           "A gang of Algerian asylum seekers was jailed  for  up  to  five
           years yesterday for  multi-million  pound  cheque  fraud,  which
           detectives  feared  was  being  used   to   fund   international
           terrorism."


    That report  identified  the  appellant  by  name,  age  and  place  of
    residence as having received two years' imprisonment.

18. Prayed in aid by Ms Webber was the fact that nothing had been published
    since those reports to  retract  the  view  that  the  fraud  had  been
    masterminded to provide funds for terrorist activities.  Drawn  to  our
    attention was the fact  that  at  least  two  of  the  appellant's  co-
    defendants, AK and FR, were known to the Anti-Terrorist Branch.  FR had
    originally been charged in 1988 on suspicion of  terrorist  activities,
    although the proceedings had subsequently been  discontinued  in  1999.
    It was in his car that the appellant had been  arrested.   As  the  co-
    defendant KK won an appeal on asylum grounds following  his  conviction
    on the same charges as the appellant.  The Secretary of State's  appeal
    had been unsuccessful.  It was clear from the evidence that the British
    authorities believed the appellant was involved in  a  conspiracy  with
    the AK and his brother.  The very fact that the appellant was initially
    place behind glass at the  hearing  at  Field  House,  indicated  their
    continuing belief that he was a threat to security.  A co-defendant  KK
    had also won his appeal on asylum grounds following his  conviction  on
    the same charges as the appellant.  There was evidence that the British
    authorities believed the appellant's co-defendants,  KK  and  AK,  were
    involved in terrorism and specifically linked to  the  GSPC  which  was
    believed to have links with Al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).

19. It was Ms Webber's contention that there was every likelihood that  the
    Algerian authorities would at the very least suspect the  appellant  of
    supporting terrorism in North Africa because of his association with co-
    defendants with links with Al-Qa'ida.  The Secretary of State had  done
    nothing to allay  those  concerns.   The  previous  Tribunal  had  made
    findings that the government would have communicated to  Algeria  their
    suspicion  that  the  appellant  was  connected  with  terrorism.    At
    paragraph 44 of the Tribunal's determination  it  is  accepted  by  the
    Tribunal that:

           "... there will have been discussion between the UK  authorities
           and the Algerian authorities about the appellant's return."


    The appeal to the Court of Appeal had  been  allowed  by  consent,  the
    Secretary of State declining to confirm that  any  assurance  had  been
    given to the Algerian authorities that there was no suspicion that  the
    appellant was involved in terrorism.  Ms Webber urged us to accept that
    on all the evidence  before  us  that  there  was  no  attempt  by  the
    Secretary of State to deny the appellant's involvement  with  terrorism
    or to downplay his involvement in any way.

20. On the one hand there was a complete failure by the Secretary of  State
    to correct any misapprehension that the Algerian authorities  may  have
    regarding the appellant's terrorist connections and there  was  also  a
    failure to obtain any individualised assurances of no ill-treatment  on
    his return as a potential suspect of terrorism.   It  was  Ms  Webber's
    argument that it was that situation which placed  the  appellant  in  a
    vulnerable position.


Risk of Serious Ill-Treatment

21. Ms Webber invited us to accept that the previous Tribunal had  accepted
    the assertion that anyone suspected of involvement with or support  for
    terrorism would face a risk of persecution on return to  Algeria.   The
    previous Tribunal had cited a UNHCR position paper (date not given)  on
    the return of  Algerian  nationals  specifying  its  reference  to  the
    UNHCR's concern about human rights abuses in Algeria of those suspected
    of terrorism.  At  paragraph  32  of  the  determination  the  previous
    Tribunal commented on the UNHCR paper as follows:


           "UNHCR expresses concern that asylum seekers found not to be  in
           need of international protection may face hostile treatment  due
           to the Algerian Government's perception that such  persons  have
           been involved in international  terrorism.   It  continues  that
           there are public  reports  that  European  intelligence/security
           authorities have uncovered networks related to the GSPC and  the
           GIA in recent months.  It is alleged that these networks operate
           within the context of Algerian and other North  African  migrant
           communities in Europe.  The report goes on to imply  that  those
           persons who have had prior links to Islamist movements would  be
           treated upon return with suspicion and that there  is  a  strong
           presumption that such persons may be  subjected  to  persecutory
           treatment upon return."


22. Also relied upon  by  Ms  Webber  was  paragraph  33  of  the  previous
    Tribunal's determination which considered Dr Joffe's report.  Dr  Joffe
    had referred to the "wide practice of torture" against those  suspected
    of membership of dissident groups.  Notwithstanding  the  proposals  by
    President Bouteflika to introduce a spirit of national  reconciliation,
    he is clear in his view that ""throat-cutters" could  not  be  forgiven
    i.e. extremists and those accused of contacts with terrorism".

23. Albeit there has been reason for guarded optimism about  the  direction
    of Algeria under its current President, and in particular the spirit of
    national  reconciliation,  we  were  urged   to   accept   that   there
    nevertheless remained a real risk of torture or other ill-treatment  at
    the hands of the D�partement du Renseignment de la Securit�  (DRS)  for
    those suspected of association with terrorism.  Persistent  reports  of
    torture and ill-treatment by the DRS continue as well as concern  about
    the impunity of that body and the lack of any meaningful and  effective
    safeguards to protect detainees.  Those returned to  Algeria  suspected
    of links with  terrorism  but  without  the  protection  of  diplomatic
    assurances to guarantee a high level of scrutiny, remained at  risk  of
    torture  and  ill-treatment  at  the  hands  of  the   D�partement   du
    Renseignment de la Securit�.  The Secretary of  State's  argument  that
    the risk of prohibited ill-treatment does  not  exist  because  of  the
    deportation of Algerians under the Deportation  With  Assurances  (DWA)
    programme was unsustainable.  Special  Immigration  Appeals  Commission
    (SIAC) cases have upheld  decisions  to  deport  Algerians  under  this
    particular programme which gives effect  to  the  bi-lateral  agreement
    between the Algerian and British authorities that individual  returnees
    will be properly treated and puts in place a scheme for monitoring such
    assurances by the British Embassy in Algiers.  Whilst  Algeria  may  be
    leaving behind a period  of  authoritarian  military  rule  and  moving
    towards democracy, without effective monitoring by the British  Embassy
    in Algiers, those returned under suspicion of terrorist links  were  at
    real risk at the hands of the DRS.

24. Acknowledging the generalised improvement in Algeria in terms of  human
    rights since July 2006, Ms Webber reminded us that to date in  no  case
    had SIAC relied solely on the improving human rights situation.  In  Y,
    (SC/36/2005) BB, (SC/39/2005), G (SC/02/2005) and U, (SC/32/2005)  SIAC
    expressly said that without accepting the assurances by  the  Secretary
    of State they would have concluded there to be a  real  risk  to  those
    appellants.  In this particular case this appellant did  not  have  the
    security of diplomatic assurances.  It was to be noted that Y, BB and U
    had all undergone Court of Appeal scrutiny.  In the case of Q, although
    that  appellant  was  returning  to  Algeria  without   an   individual
    assurance, he was nevertheless returning as someone who  had  been  the
    subject of a  SIAC  appeal,  albeit  later  withdrawn.   His  case  was
    assimilated  with  others  and  there  had  been   intense   diplomatic
    negotiations between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,  the  British
    Embassy in Algiers and the Algerian authorities.   Notwithstanding  the
    absence of a specific assurance, he nevertheless  had  a  high  profile
    which  was  known  to  the  British  Embassy  in  Algiers  and  similar
    monitoring arrangements had been offered to his family.  His  situation
    was not comparable with  that  of  this  appellant  who  would  not  be
    returning with the benefit of any such monitoring arrangements with the
    British Embassy in Algiers.

Country Evidence

25. Ms Webber drew our attention to  the  Home  Office  Country  of  Origin
    Information (COI) Report on Algeria dated November 2007, quoting the US
    State Department Report of 2006 which had been published in March  2007
    that although the frequency and severity of torture had declined during
    the year, human rights  lawyers  in  Algeria  maintained  that  torture
    continued to occur in military prisons.  At paragraph 8.13 of  the  COI
    Report  concern  had  been  expressed  particularly  concerning   those
    arrested on security grounds.   The  COI  Report  had  also  quoted  an
    Amnesty International Report of July  2006  which  in  commenting  that
    there had been a decrease in the use  of  torture  by  the  police  and
    gendarmerie, had nevertheless reported that torture  and  ill-treatment
    continued to be used systematically by military security, especially in
    the interrogation of  individuals  believed  to  be  in  possession  of
    information relating to terrorist attacks (paragraph 8.09).  Ms  Webber
    reminded us that the  DRS  had  powers  of  access  which  extended  to
    prisoners both pre-arraignment and pre-judicial access.

26. The Amnesty International Report of July  2006  entitled  "Unrestrained
    Powers: Torture by Algeria's Military Security" detailed the continuing
    torture used systematically by the military security  described  as  an
    intelligence agency specialising in the  interrogation  of  individuals
    believed to have information about terrorist activities.  Albeit  still
    widely known as "Military Security", the official name since  1990  has
    been the  Department  for  Information  and  Security  (D�partement  du
    Renseignement et de la Securit� - DRS).

27. Drawn in particular to our attention were passages at page 64  of  that
    report which described how the DRS remained "a force  above  the  law".
    Those suspected of terrorist  activity  continued  to  be  at  risk  of
    torture at the hands  of  the  DRS.   Amnesty  International  expressed
    concern that arrest and detention by the  DRS  routinely  violated  key
    safeguards and procedures established under Algerian and  international
    law to protect detainees from abuse.  The report described the officers
    and personnel of the DRS  as  members  of  the  military  and  as  such
    operating under the authority of the senior army command  and  Ministry
    of Defence.  Algerian law empowered DRS personnel to exercise the  role
    of judicial police, a function otherwise exercised only by  the  police
    and gendarmerie.  Officers of the judicial  police  were  endowed  with
    powers to open police investigations, arrest suspects and  detain  them
    for questioning for a fixed period of time known as garde � vue,  until
    either charged or released.  The period of garde � vue is limited to 48
    hours in ordinary criminal cases but can be extended up to 12  days  in
    cases which are believed to be linked to terrorist  activity.   Amnesty
    International's research revealed that the DRS plays a  major  role  in
    investigating alleged terrorism related offences.

28. Page 69 of the Amnesty International Report described the routine  lack
    of contact with the outside world for suspects held  by  the  DRS.   It
    described the incommunicado detention as denying contact with  families
    and access to legal advice and medical care.   It  also  described  the
    fact that detainees suspected of terrorist  activities  were  routinely
    held in secret locations in facilities  not  officially  recognised  as
    places of detention.  Pages 71 to 76 enumerated cases  of  torture  and
    prohibited ill-treatment.  The  report  described  methods  of  torture
    including beatings, electric shocks, the method known as  "chiffon"  in
    which the victim is laid down and forced to swallow large quantities of
    dirty water, urine or chemicals  through  a  cloth  placed  over  their
    mouths.  The report referred to falaka and suspension by the arms  from
    a ceiling for long  periods  of  time.   There  were  also  reports  of
    detainees having been subjected to threats that female  family  members
    would be raped and other family members arrested.

29. Ms Webber referred us to page 62 of the  Amnesty  International  Report
    which  she  submitted  was  relevant  to  her  submissions.  Here,  the
    entrenched culture of abuse within DRS and the impunity  from  judicial
    scrutiny were a matter of comment.  The report states:

           "Recent legal measures have entrenched impunity for state agents
           and  barred  any  future  judicial  investigations  into  crimes
           committed  by  security  forces.   The   measures   are   highly
           significant  to  continuing  impunity  in  Algeria,  and   their
           practical implementation will  need  to  be  monitored  closely.
           This report will focus on aspects of the laws which are relevant
           to  human  rights  violations  against  detainees  suspected  of
           terrorist activities".

30. Ms Webber also drew our attention to the briefing to the  Human  Rights
    Committee by Amnesty International in respect of Algeria.  This  report
    is dated 1 October 2007.

31. The report noted that on 27 February 2006 the Algerian cabinet approved
    the  "Decree  implementing  the  Charter   for   Peace   and   National
    Reconciliation".  The decree  instituted  a  blanket  amnesty  for  the
    security forces and state-armed militias and furthermore  extended  the
    previous partial amnesties for members of armed groups given under  the
    Civil Harmony Law entrenching an already pervasive sense  of  impunity.
    It noted that both state forces and members of armed groups are accused
    of committing crimes under international human rights and  humanitarian
    law that have not been  investigated  as  yet.   The  Charter  did  not
    explicitly mention that state security forces  would  benefit  from  an
    amnesty.

32. A failure to provide an effective remedy for victims  of  human  rights
    violations by state agents was a  matter  of  comment  in  the  report.
    Article 44 of the Charter states that:

        "Citizens who, through their involvement  or  their  determination,
        contributed  to  saving  Algeria  and   protecting   the   nation's
        institutions, performed acts of patriotism".


    Article 45 had prohibited any legal proceedings being initiated against
    an individual or  collective  entity  for  actions  conducted  for  the
    purpose of protecting persons and property, safeguarding the nation  or
    preserving the institutions of the Democratic and Popular  Republic  of
    Algeria.  Article 46  effectively  muzzled  free  speech  and  thwarted
    access to an effective remedy for victims of human rights violations by
    state agents; we note, however, that this restriction was  a  quid  pro
    quo for the implementation of the amnesty.

33. The state of emergency imposed in 1992 increased the scope of the death
    penalty and lowered the age of criminal responsibility to 16 years.  It
    also extended the period of pre-arraignment  detention  from  2  to  12
    days.  Although the level  of  human  rights  abuses  appears  to  have
    decreased in Algeria since the 1990s, the report comments that it is in
    the context of counter-terrorism measures  that  serious  human  rights
    violations continue to be reported.  It states:

        "A significant example is the time limit of 12  days  during  which
        suspects of "acts of terrorism or subversion" can be  held  without
        charge or legal counsel (garde � vue)".

      It notes that DRS  personnel  appear  to  operate  in  effect  without
    oversight by the prosecutor or any other civilian  authority.   As  the
    arrest and detention procedures of the DRS are not subject to  civilian
    oversight, there is no safeguard to protect detainees from torture  and
    arbitrary detention when they are held in DRS barracks.

34. None of the cases reported by Amnesty International appear to have been
    investigated and inevitably there have been no prosecutions.

35. Page 20 of the briefing to the Human  Rights  Committee  documents  how
    safeguards enshrined in Algerian law are routinely disregarded  by  the
    DRS.  It reports that, in all eight cases of deportation by the  UK  to
    Algeria monitored by Amnesty International, the persons  deported  were
    arrested and held by the DRS after arrival in Algeria.  Notwithstanding
    the international scrutiny and oversight of those returned  by  the  UK
    and monitored by Amnesty International,  there  remained  a  deliberate
    disregard for their legal rights.  The real risk is that where there is
    a lack of international oversight those detained will be tortured.

36. Ms Webber made it clear that her submission was not that the  appellant
    was likely to be prosecuted; it was speculative whether or not he would
    be prosecuted.  She submitted that the real risks were  first  that  in
    the event of a prosecution the appellant would not receive a fair trial
    and second that in a criminal system where torture was not investigated
    the impunity which existed for the DRS' activities inevitably gave rise
    to a risk of ill-treatment unless  there  was  in  place  a  high-level
    diplomatic interest and mechanism for monitoring.  Ms Webber  submitted
    that the evidence was clear that the DRS had  a  de  facto  "right"  to
    obtain information in any way it considered appropriate.  The  lack  of
    an effective safeguard conferred impunity on the DRS.

Lack of Effective Safeguards

37. Various international human  rights  instruments  lay  down  the  legal
    obligations to prevent torture.  The skeleton argument prepared  by  Ms
    Webber sets out theoretical safeguards  which  the  objective  evidence
    clearly indicates that the DRS violates routinely.  This  includes  the
    use of incommunicado detention, the failure to keep  registers  readily
    available and accessible to those concerned,  including  relatives  and
    friends, as to the whereabouts of detainees etc.

38. The state of emergency imposed  in  February  1992  for  one  year  was
    extended  indefinitely  in  February  2003  and  is  still  in   place.
    Emergency laws were incorporated into the penal code and  the  code  of
    criminal procedure which have now become entrenched  in  ordinary  law.
    These emergency laws allowed the period  of  pre-arraignment  detention
    known as garde � vue to be extended from 2 to 12 days  where  detainees
    were suspected of having committed acts of or preparatory to terrorism.

39. Ms Webber's submission is that whilst measures have been taken in  2004
    which include the criminalisation of  torture,  an  effective  immunity
    remains in place in respect of the DRS.

40. Ms Webber drew our attention to the signing of the  Convention  against
    Torture and  other  human  rights  instruments  safeguarding  those  in
    detention from torture.  The  safeguards  enshrined  in  those  various
    documents were helpfully  set  out  in  her  skeleton  argument.   They
    include, inter  alia,  ensuring  that  detainees  are  held  in  places
    officially recognised as places of detention;  ensuring  the  names  of
    persons responsible for their detention are kept in  registers  readily
    available  and  accessible,  recording  the  time  and  place  of   all
    interrogations  together  with  names  of   those   present,   granting
    physicians, lawyers and family  members  access  to  detainees.   Other
    mechanisms for the prevention of acts of torture included ensuring that
    any statement established as being made as the result of torture  shall
    not be invoked as  evidence  in  any  proceedings,  ensuring  that  the
    competent authorities undertake prompt and impartial investigation when
    there are reasonable grounds  to  belief  that  torture  has  occurred,
    ensuring the victims of torture have the right to redress and  adequate
    compensation, ensuring that the alleged offender is subject to criminal
    proceedings if an investigation establishes  that  an  act  of  torture
    appears to have been committed and ensuring  independent  oversight  of
    arrest and detention.  Ms Webber reminded us that  DRS  detainees  were
    generally held incommunicado and she  relied  upon  objective  evidence
    indicating that lawyers had been harassed  and  intimidated  when  they
    have spoken out about the ill-treatment of their  clients.   The  Human
    Rights Watch Report of 20 February 2007 entitled "Algeria: Human Rights
    Lawyers Tried on Dubious Charges" refers to the trial of Amine  Sidhoum
    and Hassiba Boumerdassi, charged with providing unauthorised  documents
    to their clients in prison.  The report describes this as an attempt to
    intimidate human rights lawyers who "stand up for their clients".

41. Another area of concern drawn to our attention by Ms  Webber  was  that
    expressed by Amnesty International that interrogation reports  obtained
    by the DRS during incommunicado  detention  are  used  as  evidence  in
    Algerian courts.  This  contravenes  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure
    (CCP).  Ms Webber argued that the continuing acceptance by the Algerian
    courts of  evidence  obtained  as  a  result  of  torture  provided  an
    incentive to continue to use such prohibited methods of  interrogation.
    It was her contention that the product  was  valued  and  the  mode  of
    production overlooked.

42. Amnesty International also commented on the fact that physical evidence
    of torture was rarely  investigated  properly.   Amnesty  International
    recorded that none of the cases of  reported  torture  and  other  ill-
    treatment  documented  in  its  2006  report  appeared  to  have   been
    investigated by the Algerian authorities.  The  lack  of  investigation
    rendered meaningless the legal provisions in place offering a victim  a
    right to redress.  Difficulties for detainees in making allegations  of
    torture to the Examining Magistrate, prosecutor or court are set out at
    pages 77 to 78 of the Amnesty International report.

43. Ms Webber  invited  us  to  note  that  there  was  no  record  of  any
    significant case where  a  DRS  or  other  security  officer  had  been
    prosecuted  for  acts  of  torture  or  ill-treatment  since  the  2004
    amendments  to  the  penal  code  outlawing  torture.   The  US   State
    Department Report of 2006 also referred to the problem of impunity  and
    the Human Rights Watch referred in 2003 described the  DRS  as  "almost
    untouchable".  The DRS' impunity effectively allows torture as a method
    of extracting information to become entrenched in the  working  culture
    and ethos of the service.  Ready and regular resort to abuse has led to
    less reliance on proper conventional techniques of  interrogation.   Ms
    Webber argued that a generation of DRS officers were  therefore  likely
    to have lost the ability  to  conduct  investigations  by  conventional
    methods and relied on torture for  extracting  information.   Affording
    the status of national heroes to the perpetrators of  abuse  acting  on
    behalf of the state by the Reconciliation Charter provides immunity for
    both the present and the future.  Ms Webber argued  that  DRS  officers
    were able to  operate  without  oversight  by  other  state  organs  or
    civilian authorities.

44. Accordingly, despite positive reforms to family  law,  improvements  in
    education and human rights, and the moratorium on the implementation of
    the death penalty, there were nevertheless serious  concerns  expressed
    by the latest UN Human Rights Committee Report on Algeria published  in
    November 2007.  The principal concerns expressed by the  committee  are
    set out at paragraph 4 of the appellant's note in  detail.   Ms  Webber
    contended that the Committee's observations gave added  weight  to  the
    appellant's fear that he would face ill-treatment and  torture  by  the
    DRS if returned to Algeria.

45. The Committee's report is written in French.  At the conclusion of  the
    hearing an opportunity was afforded to  the  respondent  to  check  the
    translation upon which Ms Webber  had  relied.   Subsequently  Treasury
    Solicitors wrote confirming that they did not challenge the translation
    as submitted by Ms Webber.

46. Amongst the concerns raised by the Committee was the failure to provide
    information on cases brought by  individual  complainants  relating  to
    unfair  trial,  arbitrary  detentions   and   disappearances.    Secret
    detentions and the keeping of suspects  incommunicado  were  raised  as
    concerns together with continuing complaints of torture and inhuman and
    degrading treatment particularly engaging responsibilities of DRS.  The
    disquiet expressed by the report is  consistent  with  concerns  raised
    both in the Amnesty International Report and the  US  State  Department
    Report.

47. One area of particular concern to  this  appellant  is  the  fact  that
    although  all  civilian  prisons  are  visited  by  the   International
    Committee of the Red Cross, the DRS' detention  venues  are  not;  This
    increases considerably the risk of ill-treatment  for  someone  in  the
    DRS' detention and constraints the efficacy of the legal safeguards  in
    place to prevent torture and ill-treatment.  A returnee, with a profile
    of links with terrorism would be at risk of detention by  the  DRS  and
    without any specific assurances for monitoring their welfare, would  be
    entirely at the mercy of the DRS who according to the reports act  with
    total impunity.

48. Ms Webber then addressed us on the guidance to be found in  the  recent
    SIAC cases.  She reminded us that one crucial factor to  be  remembered
    when considering the SIAC cases is the fact that all the appellants  in
    SIAC cases would leave the United Kingdom with assurances in place.

49. Our attention was drawn in particular to paragraph 181 of the case of Y
    which focuses on country  evidence  and  in  particular  the  US  State
    Department  Report  on  Algeria  published  in  February  2005.    SIAC
    describes Algeria as "emerging from over  a  decade  of  terrorism  and
    civil  strife  in  which  between  100,000  and  150,000  persons  were
    estimated to  have  been  killed".   The  free  and  fair  election  of
    President Bouteflika  had  led  to  greater  civilian  control  thereby
    diminishing  military  influence  in   routine   decision-making.    At
    paragraph  182  of  the  judgment  it  was  noted  that  although   the
    Constitution enshrined an independent  judiciary,  executive  influence
    was noted and although the government maintained a general  control  of
    the security forces, there were  instances  "in  which  security  force
    elements acted independently of government  authority.   Some  security
    force members committed serious human rights abuses".  At paragraph 183
    of the judgment the killing of suspected terrorists by security  forces
    was noted.

50. The court also considered the Charter for Peace and Reconciliation  and
    recorded the differing views as to its effect.

51. Ms Webber drew our attention to paragraph 339 and following  paragraphs
    which she submitted painted an upbeat picture  particularly  for  those
    being returned to Algeria pursuant to the Exchange  of  Letters,  which
    are the  result  of  negotiations  between  the  British  and  Algerian
    governments to implement assurances for the return of  those  suspected
    of terrorism.  Under cover of a  letter  dated  27  November  2007  the
    respondent provided a copy of  the  Exchange  of  Letters  between  the
    British Prime Minister, and the Algerian President.

52. Much reliance was placed by Ms Webber on paragraph 386 of the  judgment
    in Y which says:

           "Of course, the evidence does not  show  that  torture  has  now
           ceased to be a real risk for everyone in all  circumstances  and
           it would be wrong to conclude that that  state  of  affairs  now
           exists, but  it  is  possible  to  make  a  more  individualised
           assessment of that risk for  someone  in  DRS  detention  for  a
           relatively short period."

    What does emerge from the judgment is that those returned  pursuant  to
    the negotiations between the British and Algerian governments  will  be
    provided with a significant measure of protection.


53. Paragraphs 391 and 392 of the judgment in Y focus on the effect of  the
    bi-lateral assurances.  What is clear is that assurances of  monitoring
    by the British diplomatic mission in Algiers can reduce the risk of ill-
    treatment to a returnee.

54. Ms Webber  invited  us  to  accept  that  those  returnees  to  Algeria
    returning without the benefit of specific assurances as to their safety
    were likely to be detained by the DRS where there was  a  suspicion  of
    terrorist activity.  The objective  evidence  suggested  that  the  DRS
    behaved brutally and that such a returnee was likely to be  ill-treated
    and charged.  Ms Webber relied on the fates  of  Q  and  H;  both  were
    detained for the legal maximum of 12 days.

55. In the case of BB, SIAC at paragraph 5 of that judgment considered  the
    assurances given by the Algerian Government:

           "5.   In  this  case,  the  assurances  given  by  the  Algerian
               Government are central to the issue of safety on return.  We
               hold that we can and should evaluate their  credibility  and
               worth.  By what yardsticks should they be  judged?   Without
               attempting to lay down rules which must apply in every case,
               we  believe  that  four  conditions  must,  in  general,  be
               satisfied:


                     i) the terms of the assurances must be  such  that,  if
                        they are fulfilled, the person returned will not  be
                        subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3;


                    ii) the assurances must be given in good faith;

                   iii) there must be a sound objective basis for  believing
                        that the assurances will be fulfilled;

                    iv) fulfilment of the  assurances  must  be  capable  of
                        being verified."

56. At paragraph 6 the Commission held that an assurance would only  be  of
    worth if it was capable of being verified by such a mechanism  such  as
    monitoring,  for  example.   The  Commission  gave  guidance  that  the
    starting point for considering the issue of safety on  return  was  the
    general situation subsisting in the country.  Whilst the Commission  in
    BB adopted the assessment of the  country  situation  set  out  in  the
    judgment in Y, it is clear that the political  and  security  situation
    has improved in Algeria over recent years  although  Ms  Webber  argued
    that there remained a real risk to those  suspected  of  terrorism  and
    asked us to  have  regard  to  the  fact  that  torture  had  not  been
    eradicated.

57. Ms Webber, commenting  on  SIAC's  rejection  in  paragraph  8  of  the
    judgment in BB of Professor Seddon's view that it would  be  unsafe  to
    return all persons  suspected  of  involvement  in  Islamist  extremist
    activities, urged us to accept that it would be na�ve to conclude  that
    no one in that category would be at risk on return to Algeria.

58. Ms Webber prayed in aid Mr Layden's assessment of the situation set out
    at paragraph 11 of the judgment in BB.  Mr Anthony Layden, the  Foreign
    and Commonwealth  Special  Representative,  acknowledged  that  torture
    still existed in Algeria but was hopeful that it was  on  the  decline.
    Ms Webber referred us to  the  fact  that  he  accepted  that  civilian
    authorities did not control the DRS - their chain of command is to  the
    President as Minister of Defence.  Mr Layden had noted that he had  not
    seen any report of any prosecution of a DRS officer for torture or ill-
    treatment.

      "He bluntly acknowledged that he was not saying that there  would  not
        be a risk of ill-treatment if the United Kingdom Government had not
        made the special arrangements which it had.  However his unshakable
        view was that the assurances given by the Algerian  authorities  in
        the case of BB eliminated any real risk that he would be subject to
        torture or ill-treatment."

      Ms Webber invited us to conclude from Mr Layden's assessment  of  BB's
    risk on return to Algeria that it was the assurances which  gave  BB  a
    measure of protection.  Paragraph 14 set out the  assurances  given  to
    BB.  The assurances included an assurance that "his human dignity  will
    be respected under all circumstances".  SIAC concluded at paragraph  17
    of the judgment in BB that  they  accepted  the  Algerian  government's
    intention to comply with the assurances given.  The long-term  interest
    of the Algerian  state  necessitated  compliance  with  the  assurances
    given.

59. At paragraph 19 of the judgment in BB, there is reference to the return
    of I and V in June 2006.  Both were deported  after  their  appeals  to
    SIAC were withdrawn.  In the case of V  no  assurances  were  given  or
    sought but it is accepted that neither appear to have been ill-treated.
     Both, it appears, were detained for five to six days on  their  return
    but neither made any complaint of torture or ill-treatment.  Both  they
    and their families were offered the opportunity to contact the  British
    Embassy in Algiers although neither did so.  There was a  reference  to
    fear on their part of "reprisals".  It was to be remembered that both I
    and V had appeals to SIAC which they later withdrew.  They had  enjoyed
    a higher profile accordingly than that enjoyed by the appellant in this
    case.

60. Ms Webber, acknowledging the persuasiveness of any High Court judgments
    and SIAC judgments, nevertheless reminded us that ultimately it  was  a
    matter for this Tribunal to re-visit information if there was now fresh
    evidence which had not been available before SIAC or the High Court  in
    earlier cases.  In the case of G, the common ground in relation to  the
    country situation in Algeria was summarised helpfully at paragraph  26.
    In particular Ms Webber relied on (d) in paragraph 26 which states:

           "The Algerian Government has given the UK Government  assurances
           as to the treatment of its citizens suspected of  terrorism  who
           are returned there.  In the absence of  these  assurances  there
           would be a real risk that  on  his  return  to  Algeria  G  (and
           persons in a similar position) would be tortured or  subject  to
           other ill-treatment".

61. Ms Webber then drew our attention to the case of U.  In particular  our
    attention was drawn to paragraph 37 of that judgment which begins:

           "The events which have occurred since 'BB' and 'G' were  decided
           demonstrate the following:


                  i) The clear view of Mr Layden that there was  absolutely
                     no reason to believe that 'H'  would  be  arrested  or
                     detained ... if deported to Algeria has been shown  to
                     be mistaken.


                 ii) However, the  Algerian  state  has  fulfilled  to  the
                     letter, those parts of its assurances to  the  British
                     Government which can be conclusively verified: ...

                iii) It is necessary to obtain such assurances in  relation
                     to an individual deportee for his safety on return  to
                     be reasonably assured".


    The paragraph also records that there  is  evidence  that  the  British
    Government has fulfilled its  obligations  to  take  sufficient  active
    steps to ensure the Algerian Government fulfils its assurances.  At (v)
    the judgment continues:


               "(v)    The fact that the possibility that 'Q' and  'H'  may
                     have heard the noises  of  actual  or  pretended  ill-
                     treatment of others during their detention  cannot  be
                     wholly excluded does not mean that verification of the
                     fulfilment by the Algerian State of its assurances has
                     not occurred.  As we have recited,  information  about
                     their treatment and condition in  detention  has  been
                     provided to SIAC from a  variety  of  sources.   Taken
                     together,  they  do  not  establish  that  there   are
                     substantial grounds for believing that they have  been
                     ill-treated.  What verification (like monitoring)  can
                     achieve is confidence, but not complete certainty that
                     ill-treatment has no occurred.  Provided that it does,
                     the  fourth  condition  identified  in  'BB'  will  be
                     fulfilled".


62. Ms Webber prayed in aid the fact that although  the  evidence  did  not
    satisfy SIAC on a balance of probabilities that Q and H were exposed to
    the sound of actual or pretend ill-treatment the  possibility  of  such
    could not be excluded.  The absence of  independent  monitoring  was  a
    crucial factor.

63. SIAC's conclusions in U were upheld by the Court of Appeal in the cases
    of MT, RB and U [2007] EWCA Civ 808.  The Court of Appeal had held that
    SIAC's approach was reasonable and lawful and especially with regard to
    the assurances which were in place.   Therefore  the  factual  findings
    made by SIAC were confirmed and upheld.

64. Mitting J in BB accepted that the  assurances  given  by  the  Algerian
    government were "central" to whether or not there was a risk on return.
     Mitting J acknowledged that it would be na�ve to find that no  persons
    suspected of terrorist activity would be at risk  of  torture  or  ill-
    treatment at the hands of the Algerian security forces.  The  objective
    evidence, confirmed by Mr Layden, indicates  that  torture  remains  an
    issue in Algeria especially as the DRS is not under  civilian  control.
    In the case of G (SC/02/05) it was not disputed that torture and  other
    ill-treatment continued to be used on a systematic basis  by  the  DRS.
    What was also confirmed was that in the absence  of  formal  assurances
    given by the Algerian Government to the UK Government there would be  a
    real risk on return of torture or other ill-treatment.

65. The need for an individualised assurance in relation  to  deportees  to
    Algeria in order for a reasonable assurance of  safety  on  return  was
    repeated by Mitting J in U.  SIAC's approach was confirmed by the Court
    of Appeal in MT, RB and U.

66. Ms Webber argued that in no case had the Commission  been  prepared  to
    rely merely on the perceived improvement in the human rights  situation
    in Algeria or the Presidential commitment to controlling  the  security
    forces without the additional guarantee of an individualised diplomatic
    assurance in order to uphold  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  to
    remove a suspected terrorist to Algeria.

67. Ms Webber also prayed in aid that the US Government had also  indicated
    that it would demand similar assurances from the  Algerian  authorities
    prior to returning any detainees from Guantanamo to Algeria.  ABC  News
    reported:

           "The US Government maintains it has not repatriated any prisoner
           without first getting assurances they will  not  be  mistreated,
           but lawyers for the prisoners and some rights groups have called
           the US position hypocritical".


68. In her skeleton argument at paragraphs 45 to 52, Ms  Webber  prayed  in
    aid the intensification of terrorist violence since SIAC's first global
    summary in Y.  The  improvement  in  the  human  rights  situation  was
    equated with the decline in urban terrorism in  Algeria.   However,  Ms
    Webber drew to our attention the  fact  that,  in  recent  months,  the
    decline in urban terrorism had seemingly been reversed and violence had
    again become an issue in Algeria.  The  GSPC  transformation  into  the
    Maghrab branch of Al-Qa'ida had resulted in more funding for  terrorist
    activities in North Africa.   Our  attention  was  drawn  to  newspaper
    cuttings reporting the return  of  suicide  bombings  to  Algeria.   Ms
    Webber argued that  it  was  inherently  unlikely  that  Algeria  would
    liberalise its  laws  and  practices  at  a  time  when  terrorism  was
    worsening.  The deterioration in the security situation in Algeria  was
    yet another consideration for the Tribunal in determining the safety of
    returning HS to Algeria.   Ms  Webber  argued  that  it  was  extremely
    relevant that the group with which this appellant had  been  associated
    through his co-defendants, namely GSPC,  was  now  viewed  as  a  major
    security threat in Algeria.  The DRS, if it suspected the appellant  of
    involvement in a conspiracy to supply funds to a group suspected of re-
    introducing violence to Algeria, would place him  at  serious  risk  of
    torture or ill-treatment at the hands of the DRS on return to  Algeria.
    The domestic war on terror was in the process of  intensification,  the
    temptation to continue using torture or prohibitive ill-treatment as  a
    means of extracting information from  those  with  suspected  links  to
    terrorism would not be lessened.

69. Ultimately Ms Webber submitted to us that the appellant was not  in  an
    analogous position to other deportees who had been returned  under  the
    DWA scheme.   The  appellant  would  not  have  the  safeguard  of  any
    assurances, there would be no guaranteed programme of contact with  the
    British Embassy, no regular checks of his welfare by them or indeed any
    knowledge of his whereabouts.  The  DRS'  treatment  of  him  would  go
    unmonitored.  In that situation, there  was  no  meaningful  comparison
    with those returned with assurances.  The risk,  Ms  Webber  submitted,
    was further exacerbated by the recent worsening of  the  political  and
    security situation and the increased interest the DRS would  inevitably
    have in him as a potential terrorist or  a  source  of  information  on
    terrorist activity in Algeria.

70. Ms Webber asked us to find that  the  appellant  was,  because  of  his
    association with terrorism, entitled to recognition as a refugee or, in
    the alternative to humanitarian protection.

71. Ms Grange on behalf of the Secretary of State invited  us  to  consider
    the very clear but narrow issues in this  reconsideration.   The  issue
    she submitted was inherently a simple one - Is there  a  real  risk  of
    persecution/ill-treatment on returning this appellant to Algeria.

72. She reminded us that there was no separate  allegation  of  a  flagrant
    breach of Article 6; the appellant's  contention  being  that  the  DRS
    acted with impunity as  there  was  no  criminal  system  in  place  to
    investigate torture.

73. Ms Grange reminded us that prior to his departure from Algeria in  July
    2000, the appellant had not been involved with any  terrorist  activity
    and was not suspected as a person involved in any way  with  terrorism.
    He was an English teacher and his original asylum claim had been  based
    on what he perceived to  be  hostility  towards  him  by  the  Algerian
    authorities because of his union activity.

74. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Grange acknowledged that  the  Algerian
    authorities would be aware of  his  conviction  for  an  offence  of  a
    conspiracy to defraud.  It was important, she  submitted,  to  look  at
    exactly what had been said in the press which linked him with terrorist
    funding.  At page 197 the BBC report  had  referred  to  "possibly  for
    terrorism".

75. The fact that the gang had been caught by  the  Anti-Terrorist  Branch,
    clearly indicated a terrorist aspect to the conspiracy.   However,  the
    funds had not been traced.  There was no concrete evidence of where the
    funds had gone and much of the media reporting  had  been  speculative.
    Accepting the headlines in the press, it was necessary to look  at  the
    detail which was far less certain in its information.   The  conviction
    itself had been for an offence of fraud.  The respondent accepted  that
    the conviction would be of interest but Ms Grange urged  us  to  accept
    that it was unlikely that the  appellant  would  be  subjected  to  any
    greater interest than the standard 12 days of detention,  but  accepted
    that it was likely that the DRS would be involved.   It  was  necessary
    not to over-react to the press reports.  In the absence of  any  proven
    link with terrorism, it was not likely  that  the  appellant  would  be
    subjected to anything more than the standard DRS interest in him.

76. Ms Grange submitted that the details  in  the  bail  summary,  and  the
    continued detention of  the  appellant,  took  the  matter  no  further
    forward than the press reports.  The resistance to  bail  was  entirely
    consistent with the press reports which of themselves did not  indicate
    that the appellant was likely to  be  of  anything  more  than  routine
    interest to the DRS.

77. In response to the arguments put forward by Ms Webber on behalf of  the
    appellant in respect of his co-conspirators, Ms Grange reminded us that
    FR had only been charged and not convicted.  The charge had  been  made
    nine years ago and he would not be likely  to  be  of  any  significant
    interest to the DRS.  With respect to KK and AK, both had left  Algeria
    in 1991.  Although prominent as terrorists in  Algeria  at  that  time,
    many years had now elapsed and it was unlikely that they  would  be  of
    current interest.  Again there was suspicion, but no actual proof, of a
    terrorist link in respect of AK.  It was  the  respondent's  submission
    that there was no proven link between the co-conspirators and terrorist
    activity.  Their involvement in terrorism was a long time ago and  they
    would  be  of  no  operational  significance  to  the  DRS  now.   AK's
    conviction would be of only indirect interest as he was the brother  of
    a co-conspirator.  The association was therefore sufficiently remote as
    to generate no specific collateral interest in the appellant.  The lack
    of up-to-date information of any involvement by AK with the GSPC was  a
    factor.  The DRS would only be interested in the appellant if he was of
    current operational interest and the fact that so many  years  had  now
    elapsed since his involvement with the co-conspirators, it  was  highly
    unlikely that he would be of interest to the Algerian security  forces.
    The appellant's own involvement in activities had ceased  in  September
    2003 which was over four years ago.  He  had  been  in  detention  ever
    since.  These  were  all  highly  significant  factors  in  determining
    whether or not he would be of current operational interest.

78. Dealing with background information, Ms Grange submitted that there had
    been a significant improvement in security and human rights in Algeria.
     The judgments in the SIAC cases were  detailed  and  followed  hearing
    extensive expert evidence.  There had been evidence from FCO  officials
    which had been highly persuasive.  The recent cases of Y, BB and U were
    of significant persuasive authority.  It was  an  important  aspect  of
    these cases that SIAC had accepted the  effectiveness  of  non-official
    monitoring.  Even without  official  assurances,  their  lack  did  not
    necessarily mean that there would be no verification of  the  situation
    on the appellant's return.  Praying in aid the cases of  V  and  Q,  Ms
    Grange asked us to accept that Amnesty conducted a monitoring  function
    and the situation in respect of the appellant if  returned  to  Algeria
    could be verified.  Acknowledging that inevitably  there  would  be  no
    verification during any period of detention, she nevertheless urged  us
    to accept there would be ex  post  facto  monitoring  which  was  still
    significant in terms of SIAC's expectations.  Algeria was committed  to
    maintaining its international reputation.

79. Referring to the case of G, Ms Grange drew our attention  to  paragraph
    26 and in particular sub-paragraph (d) which referred to persons  in  a
    similar position as G being at risk.  It  was  important  to  emphasise
    that this appellant did not fall within that category.  Paragraph 35 of
    the judgment dealt with the experience of V and I, neither of whom  had
    reported any ill-treatment although there had been a fear on their part
    of reprisals.  Reliance was also placed by Ms Grange on  paragraphs  36
    and 38 of the judgment.  SIAC had concluded that  the  length  of  time
    since G had been in Algeria coupled with the fact that he had  been  in
    detention or on strict bail conditions since December 2001  was  likely
    to lead to his categorisation as  someone  of  no  current  operational
    interest.

80. The case of U had been decided as recently as May of  2007.   Paragraph
    13 of the judgment summarised the background thus:

           "13.  Three divisions of SIAC have now considered the  state  of
               affairs in Algeria and the reliability of  assurances  given
               by the Algerian State.  We adopt them and do not  intend  to
               repeat them.  In summary they are that: Algeria is making  a
               sincere, broadly supported and generally successful  attempt
               to transform itself from a war-torn authoritarian state to a
               normally  functioning  civil  society;   solemn   diplomatic
               assurances given  by  the  Algerian  State  to  the  British
               Government about individual deportees are reliable  and  can
               safely be accepted."


81.   Paragraph 14 of  the  judgment  in  U  refers  to  the  fact  that  no
    individual assurance was given in the case of Q.  Q was returned on  20
    January 2007 and detained under Article 51 of  the  Criminal  Procedure
    Code on 25 January 2007.  Q was detained by the  DRS  and  concern  was
    expressed  by  Amnesty  International  as  to  the  risk  of   torture.
    Enquiries by a British Embassy official elicited the information that Q
    had been afforded access to a lawyer and had been able to speak to  his
    family by telephone.  He was subsequently charged  with  two  offences,
    including membership of an armed terrorist  group  active  abroad.   He
    claimed that whilst DRS custody that he  heard  screams  of  people  he
    believed to have been undergoing torture.


82. At paragraph 22 of the judgment,  H's  case  was  considered.   He  was
    returned to Algeria on 26 January and  detained  on  30  January.   The
    British Embassy arranged to speak with one of his brothers on a  weekly
    basis.  H also indicated that he had heard the  screams  of  people  he
    believed were crying out in pain whilst being subjected to torture.

83. Paragraph 27 considers the treatment of Q and  H.   It  notes  that  in
    neither  case  was  any  individual  assurance  given  to  the  British
    Government broken because no assurance was given in the case of  Q  and
    there was no relevant assurance in the case of H.   In  each  case  the
    time limit prescribed for detention by the Algerian law was  respected.
    The allegation of torture was dismissed and  there  was  a  finding  of
    implausibility as to H's allegation that he had heard the screams of  a
    woman being "stretched" in a nearby cell.   Ms  Grange  also  drew  our
    attention to paragraph 35 which found that the evidence did not satisfy
    the Commission that Q and H  were  exposed  to  the  sounds  of  people
    experiencing torture although the possibility could not be excluded.

84. The reference to the  need  to  obtain  assurances  in  respect  of  an
    individual deportee for his safety on return to be  reasonably  assured
    was accepted by Ms Grange.  This is set out at  paragraph  37(iii)  (of
    the judgment in the case of U) and has been quoted in full  earlier  in
    this determination.  However, she submitted that that sub-paragraph had
    to be viewed in the context of a person being deported from the  United
    Kingdom to Algeria in the interests of national security.  It was clear
    that there was a real risk attached to such deportation.  Q and  V  had
    both been returned without assurances and neither had been ill-treated.
     Sub-paragraph (v) stated:-

          "(v)    The fact that the possibility that 'Q' and  'H'  may  have
               heard the noises of actual  or  pretended  ill-treatment  of
               others during their detention cannot be wholly excluded does
               not mean that verification of the fulfilment by the Algerian
               State of its  assurances  has  not  occurred.   As  we  have
               recited, information about their treatment and condition  in
               detention has been  provided  to  SIAC  from  a  variety  of
               sources.  Taken together, they do not establish  that  there
               are substantial grounds for believing that  they  have  been
               ill-treated.   What  verification  (like   monitoring)   can
               achieve is confidence, but not complete certainty that  ill-
               treatment has no  occurred.   Provided  that  it  does,  the
               fourth condition identified in 'BB' will be fulfilled".


    Again our attention was drawn to the fact that the Court of Appeal  had
    approved of the SIAC judgments in MT, RB and U.  The  Court  of  Appeal
    had found that the DRS was not out of control and non-accountable.


85. Y, BB and U were all very up-to-date,  having  been  decided  in  2007.
    There was expert evidence which had been considered by SIAC  which  was
    highly significant.  It was accepted  that  there  had  been  a  recent
    increase in the number of bombings and violence  in  Algeria.   It  was
    also accepted that there was a continuing malpractice by  the  DRS  but
    they were limited in the scale.

86. Ms Grange submitted that the individual circumstances were the  key  to
    the assessment of risk.  SIAC had not accepted that  prison  conditions
    in Algeria violated Article 3 rights and she also  prayed  in  aid  the
    fact that two further returnees -X and A - had not  been  subjected  to
    ill-treatment on return.  In the current situation there was no  reason
    to fear that the situation would lead to  a  loss  of  control  by  the
    President in respect of the DRS' activities.

87. By  way  of  response  to  Ms  Webber's  argument  that  the  increased
    volatility and security situation in  Algeria  would  de-stabilise  the
    peace process, Ms Grange drew to our attention the fact that  SIAC  had
    rejected that in  its  most  recent  determination.   That  was  highly
    persuasive in her view.  Y had been tried and acquitted  in  the  ricin
    case.  It had  been  accepted  that  there  was  evidence  that  Y  had
    associations with FIS, was later a GIA supporter and a GSPC  supporter.
    Following the approach taken by SIAC in the case of Y, the question  to
    be asked in this particular case was whether or not the  appellant  was
    going  to  be  of  current  operational  value  and  therefore  of  any
    significant interest  to  the  DRS.   His  involvement  with  terrorist
    activities was over four years old and his involvement and  links  with
    the GSPC were tenuous at best.   His  long  period  of  detention  also
    contributed to  the  argument  that  he  would  be  of  no  operational
    interest.  Therefore  in  all  those  circumstances  relating  to  this
    appellant, no real risk had been made out that he would be  of  current
    operational interest to the DRS.

88. With regard to recent objective evidence relating to Algeria, Ms Grange
    submitted on behalf of the respondent that DWA returnees, although some
    had been detained, there was no evidence that they had  been  tortured.
    SIAC had factored into their determination the most recent  and  up-to-
    date information when assessing  risk  on  return.   All  the  evidence
    relating  to  those  who  had  been  returned  indicated  that,  albeit
    detained, they had nevertheless not suffered any serious  ill-treatment
    or torture.  It was only in the case of those at greatest risk that had
    there been considered necessary to obtain assurances.  Paragraph 391 of
    Y notes that only where there is a prospect that  there  will  be  ill-
    treatment  are  assurances  sought.   Ms  Grange  argued  that  if  the
    appellant were to be ill-treated on return, it would jeopardise returns
    under the DWA  programme  albeit  that  he  himself  had  not  specific
    individualised protection.  Q and  V  had  been  scrutinised  on  their
    return by Amnesty International even though  no  individual  assurances
    were in place for them.

89. She argued that seeking an individual  assurance  in  respect  of  this
    particular appellant might be  counter-productive  and  it  would  give
    credence to the view that he was  a  likely  terrorist.   There  was  a
    danger that if such an assurance was sought, that there  would  be  the
    danger of guilt by association with other DWA returnees, some  of  whom
    were extremely  dangerous  and  who  did  threaten  national  security.
    Seeking a similar assurance  of  protection  could  suggest  that  this
    appellant was in the same category.

90. Ms Grange addressed us on the Joffe Report.   She  submitted  that  the
    report dated September 2005 was out-of-date.  She asked us to find that
    it lacked detail of why this appellant would be of current  operational
    value.  She urged us to attach little weight to Dr Joffe's opinions.

91. With regard to the most recent UN report, on the  assumption  that  the
    translation was correct, Ms Grange submitted  that  there  was  ongoing
    concern about the continuation of DRS abuses.  By way of response,  she
    prayed in aid the Hamaddouch brothers' case.   It  was  her  submission
    that the report did not take matters any further than the  most  recent
    SIAC case.  The issue was still whether or not this appellant would  be
    of current operational value to the Algerian authorities  and,  in  her
    submission, nothing had changed since the most recent cases  considered
    by SIAC.

92. She relied upon the exchange  of  letters  between  the  British  Prime
    Minister and  the  Algerian  President,  copies  of  which  were  later
    submitted to us.  We accept that they provide general assurances to  be
    applied to individuals, to be supplemented by individual assurances  in
    each case.

93. Ms Webber addressed us by way of reply,  focusing  on  changes  in  the
    human rights situation, the appellant's profile  and  the  question  of
    assurances.

94. With regard to the changes in the human rights situation she invited us
    to remind ourselves that the SIAC cases dealt with a particular species
    of case.  With regard to the assurances in the cases of  I,  V  and  Q,
    there had been no individual  assurances  but  they  were  nevertheless
    under the DWA programme.  Accordingly, information had been sent to the
    Algerian authorities with respect to all of them.  General human rights
    was linked to the issue of assurances.  It had to  be  remembered  that
    the diplomatic assurances were put  in  place  as  a  response  to  the
    concerns raised by the House of Lords.   SIAC  had  considered  whether
    these assurances could be relied upon and had come  to  their  decision
    bearing in mind the changed landscape with respect to human rights  and
    a decline in urban terrorism.  The Secretary of State had accepted that
    the DRS was an independent actor with its own power base  although  not
    accepting that it acted out  of  control  and  without  accountability.
    However, the Human Rights Committee had expressed  concerns  about  the
    way in which the DRS operated with apparent impunity.

95. The Human Rights Committee Report was again drawn to our attention  and
    paragraph 24, which recounted the harassment of  journalist  and  human
    rights lobbyists  and  organisers,  was  drawn  in  particular  to  our
    attention.  We were reminded of the report relating to the  arrest  and
    charging of two human rights lawyers.  It was important not  to  forget
    that Algeria was not an open and free democracy.

96. Ms Webber submitted that it was a difficult  balancing  act  to  decide
    whether assurances were advisable as disclosure on  return  produced  a
    risk.  The evidence as to whether returnees had  been  ill-treated  was
    not entirely  clear.   The  regime  relied  upon  the  co-operation  of
    families of deportees which was an  uncomfortable  relationship  as  of
    course it  was  the  United  Kingdom  who  had  in  fact  deported  the
    individuals.  Therefore, there was no natural trust between the British
    Embassy and the deportees and their families.

97. Dealing with the appellant's own profile, in response  to  Ms  Grange's
    submission that the appellant was of no current operational interest to
    the DRS, Ms Webber challenged the submission that he  had  no  previous
    profile and therefore would not be at risk of adverse interest  by  the
    DRS was not necessarily so.  There was a real risk that  the  appellant
    would be interrogated.  It had to be  remembered  that  Y  had  a  risk
    profile - he had been convicted in absentia  in  Algeria  for  offences
    committed in 1996.  He  had  not  been  implicated  in  involvement  of
    funding of terrorism from the United Kingdom, he, Y, had been suspected
    of involvement in the ricin plot.

98. The appellant in this case was at risk  of  interrogation  by  the  DRS
    because there was a danger that he might be perceived to  have  current
    intelligence relating to terrorist  funding  networks.   Therefore,  he
    would be of current operational value  and  interest  to  the  Algerian
    security services.  The association with FR and the KK  and  AK  placed
    the appellant at risk of being perceived by those  security  forces  as
    someone in possession of important information about funding  networks.



99. Acknowledging recent  improvement  in  human  rights  and  the  sincere
    efforts made by both the Algerian President and government to modernise
    Algeria and to be seen as partners of the west, it  was  important  for
    the assurances given by Algeria to the UK government to be seen  to  be
    working.  However Ms Webber argued that those  being  returned  without
    assurances would be at risk.  Accordingly, Ms  Webber  re-iterated  her
    argument that returning this appellant now to Algeria would  cause  the
    United Kingdom to breach its obligations under the Refugee Convention.

100. After the conclusion of the hearing, there was correspondence from  the
    Treasury Solicitors, copied to the appellant's  representatives,  which
    indicated that the Secretary of State did not wish to make any  further
    submissions following the handing down of the judgment in the  case  of
    PP, heard recently by SIAC.  It also submitted a copy of  the  exchange
    of letters between the Prime Minister, Mr.  Tony  Blair  and  President
    Bouteflika.

101. With  regard  to  monitoring  of  this  particular  appellant,  it  was
    indicated that it would take time to establish whether or not any  form
    of monitoring could be put in place.

102. Further correspondence  gave  information  about  the  appellant's  co-
    defendants:

       1)   FB has been granted asylum and indefinite leave  to  remain  in
           the United Kingdom;
       2)   AB was refused asylum and deported to  Algeria  on  24  October
           2005;
       3)   FR was granted asylum and indefinite leave  to  remain  in  the
           United in August 2000;
       4)   AK was granted asylum and indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  16
           March 2001.
       5)   AK (date of birth  17.9.1970)  -  no  information  on  computer
           records as to status.
       6)   AK (date of birth 29.3.1964) - resident in the UK  since  1992,
           married to an EEA national.  He failed to regulate his stay  and
           was deported to Algeria on 18 August 2007.
       7)   MM, appeal  rights  exhausted  and  awaiting  deportation.  The
           letter indicated that there was no current  information  on  KK.
           This  information,  we  note,  was  copied  to  the  appellant's
           solicitors.


103. We have before us a letter  received  by  the  Tribunal  from  Treasury
    Solicitors on 13 February 2008, confirming that monitoring on return is
    not to be offered to the appellant.  The letter states:

           "Monitoring of returnees is not offered by the  British  Embassy
           save for those whose deportation (with assurances) appeals  have
           been considered by SIAC and who specifically request it.   Those
           returnees are deported on national security grounds."

Analysis

104. The issue before the Tribunal is whether the  appellant  faces  a  real
    risk of persecution or ill-treatment if returned now to  Algeria.   The
    question to be answered is whether his profile would cause the Algerian
    authorities to view him as being of current operational value/interest.
     Will the sustained interest shown in him by the anti-terrorist  branch
    of the Metropolitan Police coupled with the widespread media  reporting
    of his conviction, which gave rise to speculation that  he  was  linked
    with terrorism, cause the DRS to take an interest  in  him  as  someone
    connected with terrorism?

105.  We  find  that  his  arrest  by  the  anti-terrorist  branch  of   the
    Metropolitan Police and his conviction for  conspiracy  to  defraud  in
    July 2004, for which he received a two year term of imprisonment and  a
    recommendation that he be deported,  is  likely  to  be  known  to  the
    Algerian authorities.  We also find that it is likely that he  will  be
    perceived by the Algerian authorities as someone with close connections
    to terrorism and a direct involvement in  fund  raising  for  terrorist
    activities.   His  close  association  and   affiliation   with   known
    terrorists will compound the risk in our view.

106. We note that it is common ground that no risk arises on his  return  to
    Algeria as a failed asylum seeker per se.

107. His high profile, created by media coverage of the convictions  in  the
    United Kingdom, is in our view  significant.   We  are  satisfied  that
    there was continuing interest in him by the  anti-terrorist  branch  of
    the Metropolitan Police as set out in the bail  summary  which  opposed
    his bail.  That in our view reinforces the perception  of  him  by  the
    British authorities as someone with links  to  international  terrorism
    and armed groups  in  Algeria.   Coverage  of  his  possible  terrorist
    activities in BBC's On Line News report and in the Daily  Telegraph  of
    25 November 2004 raises  his  profile.   The  Telegraph  described  the
    convictions thus:

           "A gang of Algerian asylum seekers were jailed for  up  to  five
           years yesterday for a multi-million pound  cheque  fraud,  which
           detectives  feared  was  being  used   to   fund   international
           terrorism".


    The appellant was named in that report as having been sentenced to  two
    years' imprisonment.  The media coverage naming him  was  specific  and
    clear.  There  was  no  subsequent  retraction  or  correction  of  the
    allegation that the criminal activities  in  which  the  appellant  was
    involved were masterminded to provide funds for acts of terrorism.   We
    find that the detailed media coverage of his conviction  is  likely  to
    have come to the attention of the Algerian authorities and  will  cause
    him to be seen as someone with links to terrorist activities.

108. We also accept the evidence before  us  that  the  British  authorities
    believe that his co-defendants, including inter alia the  brothers,  KK
    and AK, were involved with terrorism with specific links to the GSPC  -
    connected with Al-Qa'ida, now renamed  The  Al-Qa'ida  in  the  Islamic
    Magreb.  Whilst the British authorities have not sought in any  way  to
    downplay the appellant's involvement in  terrorism,  they  nevertheless
    refuse to provide any individualised assurance of safety on his  return
    as a terrorist suspect.

109. Notwithstanding the fact that to be returned with assurances  in  place
    alerts the  Algerian  authorities  to  the  fact  that  a  returnee  is
    considered by the British  authorities  to  be  a  threat  to  national
    security,  the  monitoring  does  provide  a  significant  measure   of
    protection for the returnee.  There would be no formal oversight of his
    welfare in place.

110. We have considered the UNHCR position paper on the return  of  Algerian
    nationals suspected  of  having  links  to  terrorism.   We  adopt  the
    previous Tribunal's summary of the paper:

           "UNHCR expresses concern that asylum seekers found not to be  in
           need of international protection may face hostile treatment  due
           to the Algerian Government's perception that such  persons  have
           been involved in international terrorism".


    It continues:


           "there are public reports  that  European  Intelligence/Security
           authorities have uncovered networks relating to the GSPC and the
           GIA in recent months.  It is alleged that these networks operate
           within the context of Algerian and other North  African  migrant
           communities in Europe.  The report goes on to imply  that  those
           persons who have had prior links to Islamist movements would  be
           treated upon return with suspicion and that there  is  a  strong
           presumption that such persons may be  subjected  to  persecutory
           treatment upon return."

111. We also note the Amnesty International Report  of  July  2006  entitled
    "Unrestrained powers: Torture by Algeria's  Military  Security".   This
    report contains a detailed account of the  continuation  of  systematic
    torture in the process of interrogating those believed to have in their
    possession information regarding terrorist activities.  It is clear  to
    us that the DRS operates with impunity and that it is regarded by  many
    to be "a force above the law".

112. The extension of the period of garde � vue from 48 hours  to  a  period
    of 12 days where terrorist activity is suspected increases in our  view
    the potential for brutal interrogation of the appellant.  We find  that
    incommunicado detention is likely to increase the risk  of  torture  as
    outlined in paragraphs 71 to 76 of  the  report.   We  have  also  been
    influenced in our decision making process by the briefing to the  Human
    Rights Committee by Amnesty International of October 2007.  We note its
    conclusion at page  20  thereof  that  legal  safeguards  are  all  but
    routinely disregarded by the DRS.

113. We have borne in mind the US State Department  Report  of  2006,  which
    highlights  the  DRS'  activities  and  the  impunity  under  which  it
    operates, and also the Human Rights Watch description of its operations
    as "almost untouchable".

114. We are influenced by the most recent report before us -  the  UN  Human
    Rights Committee published in 2007. We note that the respondent did not
    challenge its translation  from  the  original  French.   We  note  the
    disquiet expressed in this most recent report which itself reflects the
    concerns raised in earlier reports  namely  the  Amnesty  International
    Report and the US State Department Report.

115. The  fact  that  the  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  is
    specifically excluded from DRS detention venues, although permitted  to
    visit other  detention  facilities,  is  yet  another  mechanism  whose
    absence potentially increases  the  vulnerability  of  someone  in  the
    appellant's position.

116. We have considered Professor Seddon's  views  as  examined  in  BB;  we
    agree with Ms Webber's argument that to accept the Court's rejection of
    his opinion that it would be unsafe to return all persons suspected  of
    terrorist involvement would be a triumph of naivety.  We have, however,
    looked carefully at the objective evidence before us  in  reaching  our
    conclusions  and  have  been  greatly  assisted  by  the  most  current
    documentation.

117. Mr Anthony Layden's assessment,  as  Special  FCO  representative,  was
    also of assistance to us.  We note his  acknowledgement  that  torture,
    albeit hopefully in the decline, nevertheless  remains  prevalent.   We
    also note his confirmation that civilian authorities  have  no  control
    over the DRS.  He clearly, in our view, considered  that  the  specific
    assurances given by the Algerian authorities eliminated any  real  risk
    that BB would face torture or  ill-treatment.   Although  the  converse
    would not necessarily be true, namely that there would inevitably be  a
    risk where no assurances  were  in  place,  it  does  follow  that  the
    assurances are central to the assessment of  the  issue  of  safety  on
    return of someone suspected of terrorist association.

118. Whilst we have been greatly assisted by the recent SIAC  judgments,  we
    are mindful that their decisions relate exclusively to Algerians  being
    deported under the DWA  programme.   This  appellant  is  not  in  that
    category.  His welfare will not be monitored in any way by the  British
    Embassy in Algiers if returned to Algeria.  We, therefore,  distinguish
    this appellant's situation from those considered by SIAC in  the  cases
    Y, BB, G and U.

119. We adopt Ms Webber's reasoning that in no case has SIAC  been  prepared
    to rely merely  on  the  perceived  improvement  in  the  human  rights
    situation in Algeria and the presidential commitment to overseeing  and
    controlling the security forces without the additional guarantee of  an
    individualised diplomatic assurance in order to uphold the Secretary of
    State's decision to remove a suspected terrorist to Algeria.

120. Although there has been guarded optimism about the direction of  travel
    in respect of  Algeria's  approach  to  human  rights  under  President
    Boutefilka's presidency, there is considerable documentation of how the
    DRS is able to ill-treat and torture suspects with impunity.

121. Ms Grange's submission  that  several  years  have  elapsed  since  the
    appellant's co-conspirators, AK and KK  and  FR  amongst  others,  were
    charged with the relevant offences, albeit factually  correct,  in  our
    view  can  in  no  way  guarantee  disinterest   in   the   appellant's
    criminal/terrorist activities.  We reject Ms Grange's argument that the
    passage of  time  removes  any  current  operational  interest  in  the
    appellant.  The appellant's activities ceased in September  2003  which
    in our view is not sufficiently remote to  ensure  disinterest  in  any
    information he may be suspected of possessing.   The  return  of  urban
    terrorism and  increased  violence  we  think  is  likely  to  increase
    interest in those suspected of  having  useful  terrorist  intelligence
    including information about funding.

122.  We  note  Ms  Grange's  acknowledgement  that   there   were   ongoing
    malpractices by the DRS.  However "limited in scale"  these  violations
    may be, there is no guarantee that the  appellant  would  be  protected
    from any such malpractice.   It  would  be  cold  comfort  for  him  if
    tortured to know that they were of limited scale.  Y had been convicted
    in absentia in Algeria for offences committed as long ago as  1996  and
    had not been implicated in funding terrorism by involvement in criminal
    activities in the United  Kingdom.   There  is  in  our  minds  a  real
    likelihood that the Algerian authorities will  consider  the  appellant
    may be of current operational interest with  valuable  intelligence  to
    extract and this will thereby place him at risk  of  detention  for  12
    days by the DRS where  he  will  be  in  danger  of  torture  and  ill-
    treatment.

123. The flaw, with regard to Ms Grange's submission that a lack  of  formal
    assurance in respect of monitoring this particular  appellant's  return
    did not expose him to unmonitored risk  of  ill-treatment,  because  of
    Amnesty's general monitoring function in Algeria, is  that  during  any
    period of DRS detention, the appellant would be totally  incommunicado.
    Whilst Algeria may well be committed to securing a  good  international
    reputation, the fact that the DRS is known  to  act  with  uncontrolled
    brutality, a returnee such as  the  appellant  suspected  of  terrorist
    links, would  be  unprotected  from  persecution  and  Article  3  ill-
    treatment.

124. We are persuaded by the totality of the evidence before us  that  there
    is a lack of international oversight of  those  detained  by  the  DRS.
    There is no monitoring regime in place to ensure  that  those  detained
    will not be tortured, especially where there is  likelihood  that  they
    will  be  suspected  of  involvement  in  terrorism.   Any  confessions
    extracted by such interrogations are admissible in evidence and in  any
    subsequent trial,  despite  such  evidence  contravening  the  Code  of
    Criminal Procedure.

125. Consideration of all the factors relating to this appeal  leads  us  to
    have serious reservations about the appellant's safety if  returned  to
    Algeria now without any individualised assurances in place.   The  SIAC
    cases are good for the proposition that "solemn, diplomatic  assurances
    given by the Algerian state to the British government about  individual
    deportees are reliable and can safely be accepted".   However,  without
    such assurances and no prospect of monitoring by the  British  Embassy,
    we have grave concerns as to the appellant's safety if returned now  to
    Algeria as someone suspected of having links with  terrorist  activity.
    In our judgment we are satisfied that  the  appellant  is  at  risk  on
    return to Algeria of persecution or Article 3  ill-treatment,  although
    he was not convicted of a specific offence of terrorism.

126. It is clear that any mistreatment  would  arise  from  the  appellant's
    actual or perceived political beliefs.

Decision

127.  The appeal is allowed on both refugee and Article 3 ECHR grounds.
