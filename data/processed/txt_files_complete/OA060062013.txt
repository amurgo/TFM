Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr E Akohene
For the respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Vivian Ntim, date of birth  5.12.76,  is  a  citizen  of
    Ghana.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Harrington, who dismissed her appeal against the decision of  the
    respondent, dated 24.1.13, to refuse  entry  clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom to settle as the spouse of Daniel Anno Opoku, a British citizen
    present and settled in the UK.

 3. The Judge heard the appeal on 11.2.14.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Pirotta  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    25.4.14.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 3.6.14 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Harrington should be set aside.

 7. The grounds for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal assert  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge committed errors of law  in  misdirecting
    herself or failing to consider case law MM [2013] EWCH 1900  Admin  and
    Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT  640  (IAC),  and  misconstrued  the   tests   of
    reasonableness, and erroneously applied a test  of  'insurmountability'
    in the article 8 private and family life analysis. It is submitted that
    it was unreasonable and disproportionate to apply five  tests  to  show
    sufficiency of income in the circumstances where  the  evidence  showed
    genuine relationships and the sponsor could not be expected to relocate
    to Ghana.

 8. In granting permission to  appeal,  Judge  Pirotta  observed  that  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal, "shows  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge applied the Immigration Rules strictly on the provisions
    relating to income and savings,  used  a  test  of  'insurmountability'
    incorrectly  and  had  accepted   that   the   evidence   showed   that
    consideration outside the Rules was appropriate  in  the  circumstances
    because of the Sponsor's ill health. The challenges to  conclusions  on
    the proportionality of  interference  with  family  life  are  arguable
    because of the compelling compassionate circumstances found  as  facts.
    The grounds disclose an arguable error of law on the tests applied  and
    other grounds are arguable."

 9. There is no EX1 provision  available  under  Appendix  FM  for  out  of
    country settlement applications  and  thus  'insurmountable  obstacles'
    test, which is part of EX1, does not arise. It is not clear to  me  why
    the judge applied that test at �27 of  the  determination,  though  the
    considerations set out there may be relevant to proportionality of  the
    decision. However, this is not a material error of law as it played  no
    part of the ultimate decision in the appeal.

10. Mr Akohene submitted that there was an error  of  law  in  �26  of  the
    determination where the judge stated  that  the  appellant  could  work
    longer hours if necessary to increase his  income.  He  suggested  that
    this was inconsistent with evidence at recorded at  �18(d),  where  the
    appellant is recorded as stating that a stroke had reduced his  ability
    to work overtime. However,  I  have  examined  the  judge's  record  of
    proceedings and find that the  judge  has  accurately  noted  the  oral
    evidence and I note that at �18(l)  the  appellant  said  that  if  his
    ability to be joined by his wife was dependent on working overtime,  he
    could do so. That too is accurate when  compared  with  the  record  of
    proceedings. I am satisfied that there is no error in �26,  apart  from
    obvious typing errors.

11. I struggled to understand how most of the matters raised by Mr  Akohene
    in relation to the first  part  of  the  determination  prejudiced  the
    appellant. Despite the findings set out between  �24  and  �27,  which,
    apart from �26, are largely in the appellant's favour, the  judge  went
    on, in due course, to consider article 8 ECHR. There is no challenge to
    the  judge's  findings  at  �29  of  the  determination,   noting   the
    appellant's concession, that she does not meet the requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules for entry as a spouse, pursuant to  Appendix  FM  and
    Appendix FM-SE. It had been accepted that the appellant  did  not  meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules and thus the only avenue left
    to the appellant was reliance on  article  8  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules, which was considered.

12. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) has set out, inter  alia,  that  on  the  current  state  of  the
    authorities:

    (a)    the maintenance requirements of E-LTRP.3.1-3.2  stand,  although
         Blake J in R (on the application of MM)  v Secretary of  State  for
         the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said that  they  could
         constitute an unjustified and  disproportionate  interference  with
         the ability of spouses to  live  together;  he  suggested  that  an
         appropriate figure may  be  around  �13,400,  and  highlighted  the
         position of young people and low wage earners caught by the  higher
         figure in the rules;

    (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there  may
         be arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  them
         is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether
         there are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised
         under them: R (on the application of) Nagre v  Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);

    (c)    the  term  "insurmountable  obstacles"  in  provisions  such  as
         Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount: MF
         (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]  UKUT  00393  (IAC);  Izuazu
         (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC); they  concern  the
         practical possibilities of  relocation.  In  the  absence  of  such
         insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to  show  other  non-
         standard and particular features demonstrating that removal will be
         unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.

13. In Gulshan only if there were arguably good grounds for granting  leave
    to remain outside the rules was it necessary for Article 8 purposes for
    the  judge  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  were   compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules. In fact, the
    Upper Tribunal considered that it was not unduly harsh  for  a  husband
    who originated from Pakistan but was now a British national, to  return
    to Pakistan with his wife who  was  seeking  leave  to  remain  as  his
    spouse. The panel  acknowledged  that  the  couple  would  suffer  some
    hardship, as he had been in the UK since 2002, he had worked  here  and
    was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and other state  benefits,
    some of which could not be transferred to Pakistan.

14. Broadly speaking, MF (Nigeria)  in  the  Court  of  Appeal,  Nagre  and
    Gulshan make clear that the Immigration Rules as now in force are to be
    read as incorporating Article 8 of the ECHR. More recently, in  Shahzad
    (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC),  promulgated  the  day
    before the promulgation  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  under
    appeal in this case, the Upper Tribunal held:

    (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to identify  in  her
         decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR does not
         prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so on the  basis  of
         the materials before it.

     (ii)   "Maintenance of effective immigration control"  whilst  not  as
         such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR  can  normally
         be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of  disorder  or
         crime" or an aspect of "economic  well-being  of  the  country"  or
         both.

     (iii)   "[P]revention of disorder or crime" is normally  a  legitimate
         aim both in expulsion cases where there has been  criminal  conduct
         on the part of the claimant and in expulsion cases where there have
         only been breaches of immigration law.

      (iv)     MF  (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  held  that  the  new
         immigration rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal are a
         complete code. This was because of the express requirement in  them
         at paragraph 398 to have regard to  exceptional  circumstances  and
         other factors.

     (v)     It follows from this that any other rule which has  a  similar
         provision will also constitute a complete code;

     (vi)    Where an area of the rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31]  in  particular)
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements
         of the rules, only if  there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
         purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

15.  Referencing  Gulshan  (published  on   20.12.13)   at   �30   of   the
    determination,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  properly   considered
    whether there were arguably good grounds for granting leave  to  remain
    outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of compelling  circumstances
    not sufficiently recognised in the Rules. Reaching the conclusion  that
    it was arguable, the judge  then  considered  whether  the  appellant's
    circumstances were so compelling as to justify granting the application
    outside the Immigration Rules.

16. The judge then followed what can be recognised as the five Razgar steps
    for the assessment of private and family life under article 8 ECHR.  It
    was accepted at �32 that the appellant and the sponsor have family life
    and that the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer  interfered  with
    that family life, interference arguably sufficiently grave as to engage
    article 8 ECHR.  At �33 the judge found  the  interference  lawful  and
    necessary to control immigration in pursuit of the  legitimate  aim  of
    protecting the economic well-being of the UK.

17. At �34 the judge commenced  the  article  8  proportionality  balancing
    exercise, very properly taking account of the importance the  Secretary
    of  State  attaches  to  the  Immigration  Rules  post  July  2012   as
    representing the balance between the public interest  and  the  private
    and family life rights of an individual. At �35 the judge set out  what
    she considered to be the relevant factors to be weighed in the balance,
    including that the appellant did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

18. At �36 the judge reached the  conclusion  that  the  decision  did  not
    amount to a disproportionate interference with the article 8 rights  of
    the appellant and the sponsor.

19. It may have been better if  the  judge  had  not  referred  in  �35  to
    "insurmountable obstacles," as part of  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise, but the judge was right  to  consider  whether  it  would  be
    unreasonable or unjustifiably harsh to expect the sponsor  to  relocate
    to Ghana. Reference should be made to the  relevant  considerations  at
    �27, which the judge clearly took  into  account,  including  that  the
    sponsor is of Ghanian origin, has visited regularly, and  has  a  house
    there. In the circumstances, even had the  judge  applied  the  correct
    test, I am satisfied the outcome of the appeal would  still  have  been
    the same and thus there was no material error of law. The reference  to
    insurmountable obstacles did not in fact prejudice the appellant as the
    judge went on to consider all the relevant circumstances in an  article
    8 proportionality assessment. Whether or not there were  insurmountable
    obstacles was not the test applied under article 8.

20. The grounds rely on the decision of Blake J in MM &  Ors  and  complain
    that, on the basis that the judge found that the sponsor's  income  was
    sufficient to maintain the appellant without recourse to  public  funds
    and that his health meant that he could not work more, the judge should
    have  found  the   decision   an   unjustified   and   disproportionate
    interference with the family life of  the  appellant  and  the  spouse.
    Gulshan makes clear that the financial threshold stands  despite  MM  &
    Ors. Whilst the threshold could, in combination with other factors,  be
    considered disproportionate, the appellant had  failed  to  demonstrate
    that it was so, even though at �31 the judge took  into  account  MM  &
    Ors. The appellant was �4,000 short of the relevant threshold but he no
    long has to financially support his mother's medical treatment and said
    that he could  work  longer  hours  to  increase  his  income.  In  the
    circumstances, I fail to see how  the  consequences  of  this  decision
    could be regarded as  "so  excessive  in  impact  as  to  be  beyond  a
    reasonable means of giving effect to the legitimate aim," as stated  in
    MM & Ors. There is nothing preventing  the  appellant  making  a  fresh
    application on his changed financial circumstances  and  ensuring  that
    she and the sponsor meet the financial threshold and all the  necessary
    evidential requirements.

21. Taking an overall view of the evidence as set  out  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge and in the light of  the  judge's  findings,  which  are
    fully supported with cogent reasons, I fail to  see  in  what  way  the
    circumstances of this particular appellant  could  be  regarded  as  so
    compelling as to justify granting leave to remain outside the Rules  on
    the basis of article 8 ECHR because the decision of the Entry Clearance
    Officer produced a result that could be described as  unduly  harsh  or
    disproportionate.  In  my  view,   apart   from   the   references   to
    insurmountable obstacles the First-tier Tribunal Judge conducted a very
    fair  and  comprehensive  assessment  of   the   appellant's   personal
    circumstances and reached a conclusion that  was  unassailable  on  the
    facts of this case.

Conclusions:

22. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
