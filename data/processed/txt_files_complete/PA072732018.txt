Representation:
For the appellant:     None
For the respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
first Appellant in this determination identified as AB.

       1. In this  decision  I  remake  the  decision  in  response  to  the
          appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision dated 25  May
          2018,  to  refuse  his  asylum  and  human  rights  claims.    The
          appellant is a citizen of Algeria.


       2. In my 'error of law' decision dated 8 June 2019, I made  it  clear
          that there was no error  of  law  in  relation  to  the  asylum  /
          Article 3 ECHR findings made by the First-tier  Tribunal  ('FTT').
          In a decision  dated  5  September  2019  adjourning  the  resumed
          hearing of that date, I  confirmed  that  it  was  made  clear  on
          behalf of the appellant that he longer pursued his  asylum  claim.



       3. As such, this decision solely deals  with  the  appellant's  claim
          that removing him to Algeria would breach Article 8, ECHR  because
          of the family life he  has  developed  with  his  British  citizen
          partner ('A') and her children  with  a  former  partner.   A  has
          seven children but the appellant claims that he  has  family  life
          for the purposes of Article 8 with two of these.  D  was  born  in
          May 1999, and is therefore 20.  She has cerebral  palsy.   At  the
          last hearing I agreed that she should be treated as  a  vulnerable
          witness but indicated that the medical evidence was  out  of  date
          and scant and it  would  be  helpful  to  have  more  up  to  date
          evidence on this.  This has not been  provided.   S  was  born  in
          April 2002, and is  therefore  17.   There  is  evidence  that  he
          completed GCSEs in June 2019 but no clear evidence to explain  his
          current circumstances.

Preliminary issues / Hearing


       4. The appellant did not attend  the  hearing  and  has  provided  no
          explanation for this.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  appellant  was
          notified and aware of the hearing date.   After  the  promulgation
          of my 'error of law' decision, a notice of resumed hearing  listed
          for 5 September 2019  was  sent  to  the  appellant  at  his  home
          address (Smiddles Lane) and his then representatives,  Salam  &Co,
          in a notice dated 6 August 2019.


       5. That hearing was adjourned by me with specific directions for  the
          appellant to  file  and  serve  a  consolidated  bundle  before  3
          October 2019.  For convenience, I set out  the  parties  agreement
          on the relevant issues and directions I gave below.

      "3.   The parties were also able to agree the following matters:

                      i) The appellant no longer  relies  upon  his  asylum
                         claim and pursues his appeal on Article 8  grounds
                         only.


                     ii) The FTT's factual findings on Article 8  are  only
                         preserved in so far as they are  not  infected  by
                         the findings regarding  S  and  her  brother  SO's
                         ability to turn for support from their  biological
                         father - see the findings at [13], [17]  and  [20]
                         of the FTT's decision.  Ms  Hashmi  accepted  that
                         these findings should form the starting point, but
                         that she would  be  inviting  the  Upper  Tribunal
                         ('UT') to reassess the finding that the  appellant
                         and sponsor concocted an asylum claim in the light
                         of all the evidence, viewed holistically.

                    iii) As to this issue the consolidated bundle submitted
                         entirely fails to address the evidence set out  in
                         my error of law decision at [8] i.e. there  is  no
                         evidence regarding the ownership of  the  family's
                         properties and source of funding for the children.

                     iv) The main factual issues to be determined by the UT
                         include  (a)  the  nature  and   extent   of   the
                         dependency on the  part  of  S  and  SO  upon  the
                         appellant  and  the  sponsor;  (b)  the  sponsor's
                         health condition and consequent limitations in her
                         caring and parenting.  This is likely  to  involve
                         considerable cross-examination.

                      v) The independent supporting evidence in relation to
                         those issues is of some considerable  vintage  and
                         requires updating.

                    Directions

                    1) The appellant shall  file  and  serve  a  replacement
                       consolidated bundle before 3 October 2019.

                    2)  The  appellant  shall  file  and  serve  a  skeleton
                       argument   cross-referencing   to   the   replacement
                       consolidated bundle before 10 October 2019.

                    3) The  respondent  shall  file  and  serve  a  position
                       statement seven days before the hearing.

                    4) The matter will be relisted before any  UT  judge  on
                       the first date after 24 October 2019."

       6. A further notice of resumed hearing on 14 November 2019  was  sent
          on 24 September 2019 to the appellant's home address and to  Salam
          & Co.   In an email  dated  27  September  2019,  with  a  heading
          'Resumed  hearing  on  14.11.19  Bradford  Upper   Tribunal'   the
          appellant  himself  requested  further  time  to  obtain   medical
          evidence and serve  a  consolidated  bundle.   The  appellant  was
          clearly aware that the Tribunal was concerned  that  the  evidence
          as to certain key issues in the case was scant, and at that  stage
          was attempting to obtain the relevant  evidence.   In  a  decision
          dated 1 October 2019, the lawyer of the Upper  Tribunal  gave  the
          appellant an additional two weeks to do so i.e.  the  consolidated
          bundle needed to be served by 17 October 2019.


       7. It is clear from the above chronology that the appellant  was  not
          only notified of the hearing but he was personally  aware  of  the
          hearing date of 14 November and aware  that  he  was  required  to
          file and serve his updated evidence before 17 October.  There  has
          been no explanation for the failure to comply with directions  and
          no explanation for the appellant's failure to attend the  hearing.
           In all the circumstances, and  bearing  in  mind  the  overriding
          objective I decided that it was in the  interests  of  justice  to
          proceed with the hearing.


       8. Mr Diwnycz emphasised that the appellant and A did not attend  the
          hearing to make themselves available for cross-examination and  in
          the circumstances the claims in their  statements  have  not  been
          tested and should not be accepted.  He relied  upon  the  decision
          letter under appeal and invited  me  to  dismiss  the  appeal.   I
          reserved my decision and now provide my reasons in writing.

Issues in dispute

       9. I must resolve the following issues in dispute:


             i) The nature  and  extent  of  the  family  life  between  the
                appellant, A and her children, and  the  related  dependency
                the family have upon the appellant,  in  the  light  of  the
                evidence including medical evidence.


            ii) Given  the  factual  matrix,  can  the  appellant  meet  the
                requirements of the Immigration Rules?

           iii) If not, are there very compelling circumstances to  outweigh
                the public interest in removing the  appellant  to  Algeria,
                pursuant to Article 8, ECHR?

Factual findings

      10. As set out in my 'error of law' decision, the FTT erred in law  in
          making  numerous  references  to  the  biological  father  of  A's
          children, when there was no  evidence  before  the  FTT  regarding
          him.  Since the FTT's decision, the appellant, A,  D  and  S  have
          submitted brief statements dated June 2019,  in  which  they  made
          the following assertions:


             i) A has medical conditions including depression, arthritis,  a
                'neurological condition', 'eye issues'  and  diabetes.   She
                requires  the  appellant  to  help  her  with  day  to   day
                activities and caring for her daughter D and her son S.


            ii) D has cerebral palsy and is spastic diplegic.  A is D's full-
                time carer.

           iii) The appellant, A, D and S live in  the  same  household  and
                depend upon each other.  They have been a close family  unit
                since the appellant arrived in the UK in 2016.

            iv) A's ex-husband has rarely seen the children and none of  A's
                children rely on him for any type of support.

             v)  The  family  support  themselves  through  social   service
                payments.  In addition, A's elder 27 year old son who  lives
                in London, provides the  family  with  regular  payments  of
                approximately �500 monthly.

      11. Whilst Salam & Co filed and served  a  218  page  bundle  under  a
          covering letter dated 27 August 2019, this  did  not  include  the
          June 2019 statements, the contents  of  which  I  have  summarised
          above.  The statements included in that bundle were  either  dated
          11 February 2019 (appellant and  A)  or  undated  (D  and  S)  but
          appear to have been prepared for the FTT hearing that  took  place
          on 20 February 2019.   As  I  observed  in  my  5  September  2019
          adjournment decision, the vast majority of the  evidence  in  this
          bundle was scant and out  of  date,  hence  the  direction  for  a
          replacement consolidated  bundle  addressing  specifically,  inter
          alia,  D's  cerebral  palsy  and  cognitive  ability,  A's  health
          conditions and any consequent limitations on her ability  to  care
          for D, the source of funding and availability of support  for  and
          from A's other children.


      12. Having considered all the evidence available to me I  am  prepared
          to accept that as at June 2019 the appellant  was  living  with  A
          and her two children, D and S and they had a  close  relationship.
          There is no evidence to undermine the letters of  support  written
          by A, D and S to this effect in June 2019.  The evidence  relevant
          to A's  various  health  conditions  is  vague  and  difficult  to
          follow.  Prescriptions have been provided  but  are  unaccompanied
          by  any  clear  medical  evidence.   The  claim  that  A  is  very
          dependent upon the appellant is  difficult  to  resolve  with  the
          claim that A is D's full-time carer.   The  evidence  relating  to
          D's  entitlement  to  disability-related  benefits  has  not  been
          explained and is difficult to follow.


      13. I do not know what the family's current situation is  because  the
          appellant chose not to attend the  hearing  and  has  provided  no
          explanation for this.  I am satisfied that I am entitled  to  draw
          adverse inferences from the appellant's absence and  corresponding
          failure  to  explain  his  absence.   The  most  recent   evidence
          available to  me  addresses  circumstances  appertaining  in  June
          2019.  The appellant was aware that the Tribunal required  him  to
          provide updated and more detailed evidence beyond this.  This  was
          explained at the hearings in June and September that he  attended.
           Further, the appellant personally requested  additional  time  to
          obtain this evidence in  September  and  this  was  granted.   The
          appellant  was  also  aware  that  his  claim  that  A's   medical
          conditions were such that she was unable to  adequately  care  and
          parent D and S without him was disputed  by  the  respondent.   As
          noted in my adjournment decision dated  5  September  2019,  these
          are matters  that  were  likely  to  involve  considerable  cross-
          examination.  The appellant has been given  every  opportunity  to
          displace the burden upon him  of  establishing  that  his  claimed
          family life in the UK is genuine, subsisting and strong.   He  has
          failed to do so. In all the circumstances, I do  not  accept  that
          as at the date of hearing, the appellant has displaced the  burden
          of  establishing  that  he  continues  to  have  a   genuine   and
          subsisting relationships or family life with A, D and S,  or  that
          they are in any way dependent upon him.


      14. The appellant has predicated his appeal entirely upon his  claimed
          family life with A, D and S, and  has  been  unable  to  establish
          that these relationships  are  currently  genuine  or  subsisting.
          The asylum claim was not  pursued  and  the  appellant  has  never
          argued that his private  life  (to  which  little  weight  can  be
          attached) could support any  claim  to  remain  either  under  the
          Immigration Rules or Article 8 of the ECHR.  It follows  that  the
          appellant cannot meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.
          There is a strong public interest in the  appellant's  removal  to
          Algeria given his immigration history -  see  [13]  of  the  FTT's
          decision.  This cannot be outweighed by his family life  given  my
          findings of fact, and his appeal must therefore be dismissed.

Decision

      15. I remake the decision by  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal  on
          asylum and human rights grounds
