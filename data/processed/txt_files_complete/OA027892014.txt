Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Bandegani, Counsel instructed by Haq Hamilton
Solicitors
For the Claimant: Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Scott-Baker dismissing the Appellant's appeal under
    the Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR against her decision to refuse
    indefinite leave to enter from Nepal as the  child  of  her  sponsoring
    mother.

 2. The Entry Clearance  Officer  refused  entry  clearance  by  way  of  a
    decision  dated  27  January  2014  because  the  Appellant   had   not
    demonstrated that his mother held sole responsibility for  him  because
    (a) responsibility for his upbringing lay with his  grandparents  since
    2006, (b) there was no evidence of the whereabouts  of  his  biological
    father, (c) his birth certificate  was  only  recently  registered  and
    therefore did not represent a true reflection of his age  or  identity,
    and (d) there was no evidence of a relationship  between  him  and  his
    sponsoring parent, such as DNA evidence and therefore,  for  all  those
    reasons, he did not meet paragraph 297(i)(e) of the Immigration  Rules.
    The  application  was  also  refused  because  the  Appellant  had  not
    demonstrated serious and  compelling  family  or  other  considerations
    which would make his exclusion from the UK undesirable under  paragraph
    297(i)(f) and finally the decision was said to  be  proportionate  with
    Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott-Baker dismissed the  appeal  under  the
    immigration rules because, although the Appellant was found by  her  to
    be the child  of  her  UK  sponsoring  mother  (seemingly  due  to  the
    production of a DNA  report),  and  although  it  was  found  that  the
    Appellant's biological father died  in  2008,  the  Appellant  had  not
    established sole responsibility was held by his mother and  furthermore
    family life could continue to be enjoyed in  the  manner  in  which  it
    currently existed.

 4. The Appellant appealed against that decision. The key ground upon which
    permission was primarily granted by First-tier Judge Nicholson is  that
    as the judge had found that the biological  father  was  dead  and  the
    Appellant was applying to join his sole remaining  parent,  his  appeal
    should have succeeded under  paragraph  297(i)(d)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 5. The Respondent filed a rule 24 Reply which actively  engaged  with  the
    first ground in the following terms: "The  respondent  notes  that  the
    appellant would succeed under either 297(i)(a)  or  297(i)(d)...".  The
    Reply however maintained  that  there  was  no  clear  finding  on  the
    relationship between the Appellant and his mother  and  the  relatively
    recent registration of the  birth  certificate  still  gave  cause  for
    concern.

 6. The Appellant's Counsel produced a Skeleton Argument  at  the  hearing,
    which was read by all parties before submissions began.

    Submissions

 7. I queried the meaning of the phrase in the Rule 24 Reply  (namely  that
    "the appellant would succeed under either 297(i)(a) or 297(i)(d)") with
    Mr Walker whom indicated that he accepted that there was  an  error  in
    the decision, as per the Rule 24  Reply,  which  was  material  to  the
    outcome of the appeal. He further submitted that there  was  sufficient
    evidence before me to enable me to remake the decision on the facts  as
    they stand. Mr Walker submitted that the only remaining  matter  to  be
    disposed of was the birth certificate. He  however  accepted  that  the
    birth certificate's authenticity had not been challenged  and  that  no
    evidence had been served by the Respondent to demonstrate the  document
    should not be given full weight. He accepted that the statement in  the
    Refusal of Entry Clearance was therefore merely an assertion  from  the
    Respondent reflecting doubts due to  the  recent  registration  of  the
    birth. Mr Walker observed in relation to the DNA report that there  was
    acknowledgement of this report at paragraph 9 of the  decision  and  he
    accepted that the mother and Appellant were  found  to  be  related  at
    paragraph 32 of the decision, contrary to what was said in the Rule  24
    Reply.

 8. Mr Bandegani built upon Mr Walker's sensible concessions by  submitting
    inter alia that the judge below had made positive credibility  findings
    apart from the issue of  sole  responsibility  which  resulted  in  the
    appeal being dismissed under paragraph 297(i)(e). Mr Bandegani did  not
    seek to pursue his  solicitors'  second  ground  with  any  vigour.  He
    instead submitted, as did Mr Walker, that paragraph 32 of the  decision
    made three positive  findings  of  fact  which  were  unchallenged  and
    remained sound. Those findings were that the Appellant is the child  of
    his sponsoring mother, the Appellant's biological father  had  died  in
    2008 and, no adverse inference should be  drawn  from  the  Appellant's
    slowness in making an application to join the sponsor  in  the  UK.  He
    contended that paragraph 33 showed that the  judge  had  accepted  that
    money was sent to Nepal  for  the  Appellant's  and  the  grandparents'
    benefit; and paragraph 35  demonstrated  the  acceptance  of  financial
    remittances.

 9. Relying upon paragraph  12  of  his  Skeleton  Argument,  Mr  Bandegani
    further  submitted  that  the  Respondent  had   not   challenged   the
    genuineness of the birth  certificate,  no  evidence  or  reasons  were
    provided to challenge the weight to be given to it  and  no  issue  was
    taken with its form or content either. He also submitted that no  issue
    had been taken with the Appellant's  age  or  identity  for  any  other
    reason and the lack of an explanation for the late registration did not
    mean the certificate itself was automatically unreliable  without  more
    and  the  slowness  in  obtaining  the  birth  certificate   by   those
    responsible for the child was not a good reason for the  Respondent  to
    reject the certificate. He maintained that the child was under 18 years
    of age at the relevant time and  urged  me  to  remake  the  appeal  by
    allowing it.

10. I  queried  with  both  parties  whether  I  needed  to  look  at  sole
    responsibility at all under paragraph 297(i)(e) in remaking the  appeal
    and both representatives agreed that I did  not  and  should  focus  my
    attention squarely upon paragraph 297(i)(d) which was a purely  factual
    question.

    Error of Law

11. I am satisfied that in  considering  the  appeal  the  judge  committed
    errors in law such that her decision should be  set  aside.  Mr  Walker
    made several concessions before me at the oral hearing. In my view,  he
    was correct to do so. It was stated  by  Judge  Nicholson  in  granting
    permission that the judge's failure to consider paragraph 297(i)(d) was
    a Robinson obvious point. Mr Bandegani submits in his Skeleton Argument
    that the representative had taken this point factually before the First-
    tier at paragraph 25 of the decision. This is true, however, it matters
    not whether paragraph 297(i)(d) was expressly relied upon or  not. What
    matters is whether its omission from the judge's  consideration  was  a
    material error. In my judgment, and as Mr Walker accepted, there was  a
    material error of law as on the facts  found  by  the  First-tier,  the
    appeal would fall to  succeed  under  either  297(i)(a)  or  297(i)(d),
    however the First-tier did not consider that rule substantively.

12. In my view, the judge unfortunately failed to  consider  a  live  issue
    before her which was dispositive and material to  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal. Therefore,  I  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  judge  under
    paragraph 297(i)(e) and Article 8 although I do not interfere with  her
    findings of fact.

    Remaking the Decision

13.  In  remaking  the  decision,  I  must   consider   the   circumstances
    appertaining at the date of the refusal decision. The standard of proof
    is to the civil standard and that of the balance of probability. It  is
    for a party that makes any assertion to discharge the burden  of  proof
    in establishing their  assertion,  for  example,  in  relation  to  the
    reliability of documentation. I have considered all the evidence in the
    appeal, including the appellant's and  respondent's  bundles.  I  heard
    submissions from both parties which are set out in full in my record of
    proceedings.

14. Paragraph 297 of the Immigration  Rules  is  stated  in  the  following
    terms:

         '297. The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite
         leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents
         or a relative present and settled or being admitted for settlement
         in the United Kingdom are that he:

         (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a parent,
         parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:

             (a) both parents are present and settled in the United
             Kingdom; or

             (b) both parents are being admitted on the same occasion for
             settlement; or

             (c) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom
             and the other is being admitted on the same occasion for
             settlement; or

             (d) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and the
             other parent is dead; or

             (e) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had
             sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or

             (f) one parent or a relative is present and settled in the
             United Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion for
             settlement and there are serious and compelling family or
             other considerations which make exclusion of the child
             undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made for the
             child's care; and

         (ii) is under the age of 18; and

         (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and is not a
         civil partner, and has not formed an independent family unit; and

         (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the parent,
         parents or relative the

         child is seeking to join without recourse to public funds in
         accommodation which the

         parent, parents or relative the child is seeking to join, own or
         occupy exclusively; and

         (v) can, and will, be maintained adequately by the parent, parents,
         or relative the child is seeking to join, without recourse to
         public funds; and

         (vi) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this
         capacity; and

         (vii) does not fall for refusal under the general grounds for
         refusal.'

15. As noted above, the Refusal of Entry  was  predicated  upon  paragraphs
    297(i)(e) and 297(i)(f) not being met (alongside Article  8).  However,
    no consideration was given to paragraphs 297(i)(a) or 297(i)(d) of  the
    Immigration Rules.

16. The Respondent made comments  in  relation  to  the  birth  certificate
    however these fell under the umbrella of paragraph 297(i)(e). I observe
    that Mr Walker did not seek to  alter  the  bases  of  the  Refusal  by
    suggesting further sub-paragraphs of rule 297 were not met and I anyhow
    consider those issues to be implicitly accepted by the Respondent since
    the outset of the appeal their never having been taken issue with.

17. It is common ground before me that  the  Appellant  can  bring  himself
    within either paragraph  297(i)(a)  or  297(i)(d)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Under paragraph 297(i)(a) of the Immigration Rules, a child  can
    secure indefinite leave to enter where "both parents  are  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom"; and under paragraph 297(i)(d), a  child
    can secure indefinite leave to enter where "one parent is  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom or being admitted on  the  same  occasion
    for settlement and the other parent is dead".

18. As agreed by the parties, the sole remaining issues of quasi-contention
    for me to determine are, firstly, whether the mother and Appellant  are
    related (although I observe in passing that  the  acceptance  that  the
    Appellant can meet either of the above two sub-paragraphs of  rule  297
    implies that the Respondent accepts he is related to the sponsor);  and
    secondly,  whether  the  birth  certificate  is  a  reliable   document
    reflecting the Appellant's correct age and identity.

19. In relation to the first issue, in harmony with the judge below, I note
    that the Appellant has produced a DNA report which establishes that his
    sponsor is his biological mother. The Rule 24 Reply contends that there
    was no clear finding  on  this  issue  at  paragraph  9,  however  that
    submission ignores paragraph 32 of the judge's decision  which  reveals
    the judge's finding that the Appellant's father  died  in  2008,  which
    finding  has  not  been  challenged.  For  the  sake  of  clarity   and
    completeness, I equally find that the Appellant's father died  in  2008
    as evidenced in the death certificate and that the sponsor is the  sole
    surviving biological parent of the Appellant.

20. In relation to the reliability of  the  birth  document,  I  accept  Mr
    Bandegani's submissions on this issue entirely. The Respondent did  not
    seek to challenge the genuineness  of  the  birth  certificate  in  any
    serious way, as no evidence was provided with the  Respondent's  bundle
    to substantiate that the document should have less weight placed on  it
    or to demonstrate that it was lacking in form or substance in  any  way
    whatsoever. It appears that the sole challenge  to  the  weight  to  be
    given to it stems from its late creation. The  mere  assertion  that  a
    document is suspicious because it could have been created  sooner  does
    not render its contents susceptible to challenge. I find that the  bald
    assertion alone does not begin to approach the burden  of  proof  which
    rests upon the Respondent to demonstrate that the birth certificate  is
    deserving of less weight. Therefore, as stated above, I find  that  the
    Appellant is  the  biological  child  of  the  sponsor  and  the  birth
    certificate is a belated but true reflection of  the  Appellant's  true
    age and identity. For the sake of completeness I  also  find  that  the
    Appellant's date of birth is 11 September 1996 and that he was a  child
    and under 18 years of age at the relevant time.

21. Turning back to  paragraph  297(i)(d),  I  find  that  the  Appellant's
    biological mother is present and settled in the UK and  his  biological
    father has died in 2008  as  evidenced  in  the  death  certificate.  I
    therefore, do not propose to deal with paragraph 297(i)(a) nor  Article
    8 as the appeal has succeeded on the above basis under 297(i)(d).

22. For the above reasons I set aside the judge's decision and  remake  the
    decision allowing the appeal under the immigration rules.

    Decision

23. I allow the Appellant's appeal against  the  Respondent's  decision  to
    refuse entry clearance.

    Anonymity

24. I maintain the anonymity order made below by the First-tier Tribunal.

    Fee Award

25. The First-tier Tribunal did not consider making  a  fee  award  as  the
    appeal was dismissed on  all  grounds.  In  light  of  this  Tribunal's
    decision, it is appropriate for a fee award  to  be  made  against  the
    Respondent in the sum of �140 paid.
