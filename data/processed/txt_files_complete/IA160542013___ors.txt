                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and History

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hemingway) following a  hearing  on  8th
    November 2013 at Bradford. For the sake of continuity I shall refer  to
    Mr Khondoker Mehedi Akram, Mrs Afroza Begum and Master Khondoker  Fahim
    Mehedi as "the Appellants" as they were before the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge and to the Secretary of State as "the Respondent".

 2. The Appellants are citizens  of  Bangladesh.  The  first  Appellant  Mr
    Khondoker Mehedi Akram  (date  of  birth  15/12/1978)  and  the  second
    Appellant Mrs Afroza Begum (date of birth 01/01/1979) are  husband  and
    wife. The third Appellant is their minor child.

 3. Each Appellant appealed against the  Respondent's  refusal  dated  25th
    April 2013 refusing to vary their leave to remain and making a decision
    to remove them pursuant to Section 47 of the Immigration Act  2006.  It
    is recorded that the Respondent's representative at the hearing on  8th
    November 2013, withdrew the removal part of the decisions under Section
    47.

Background

 4. In his determination, Judge Hemingway sets out the background to  these
    appeals.

         "The first Appellant entered the UK on 1st October 2006,  lawfully,
         as a student.  He subsequently obtained further grants of leave  as
         a student, his last grant of leave on that basis, being until  28th
         February 2013.  The second Appellant joined him in the UK  on  20th
         May 2008 as a student dependant  and  obtained  further  grants  of
         leave, in line with the first Appellant,  as  a  dependant.   As  I
         understand it, the third Appellant came to the UK with  the  second
         Appellant and has also had  corresponding  grants  of  leave  as  a
         dependant.

         On 26th February 2013  the  first  Appellant  applied  for  further
         leave, under the Tier 2 provisions, in order to take up  employment
         with  the  University  of  Sheffield  as  a  postdoctoral  research
         associate.  Applications were made, in  line,  by  the  second  and
         third Appellants.

         The Respondent refused  the  application  of  the  first  Appellant
         because he had not provided evidence of the required funds.  He was
         required to show funds of at least �2,100  (made  up  of  �900  for
         himself and �600 for each  dependent)  for  a  consecutive  90  day
         period ending  no  more  than  31  days  before  the  date  of  his
         application.  He had provided, with his completed application form,
         bank statements issued by the HSBC Bank but, said  the  Respondent,
         the level of available funds fell below �2,100 between 3rd  January
         and 29th January 2013 and 10th  December  to  12th  December  2012.
         Thus, the requirements set out at Appendix  C  of  the  Immigration
         Rules were not met.  The  applications  of  the  second  and  third
         Appellants were refused in line.

         The Appellants have appealed and their appeals form the matters now
         to be determined".

The Judge's Findings

 5. In what is a clear comprehensive and fairly balanced determination, the
    Judge considered the essential elements of the Appellants' appeals.  He
    concluded that the  Appellants  could  not  rely  upon  the  evidential
    flexibility policy in Rodriguez. He looked at Section 55 of the Borders
    Act with reference to the third Appellant and  concluded  that  as  the
    Appellants would be removed as a family unit, that did not avail them.

 6. He also directed himself that the Appellants could not rely on any sort
    of "near miss" argument albeit that the Judge found as a fact  that  at
    the date of application the Appellant  did  have  the  necessary  funds
    available  to  them  -  the  evidence  they  have  provided  with   the
    application simply did not show this and that is  why  they  failed  to
    satisfy the relevant Immigration Rule.

 7. Having correctly identified all those factors and weighed them  in  the
    balance on the proportionality assessment, the Judge said at paragraphs
    49 and 50 of his determination,

         "I do, though, accept that, with respect to  the  first  Appellant,
         his  research  is  of   real   importance   to   him.    He   spoke
         enthusiastically and in a way which demonstrated his commitment  to
         it at the hearing.  The written evidence of Dr  Bingle,  which  was
         not challenged before me, does indicate that the first Appellant is
         involved in an important research  project  and  that  it  will  be
         difficult to replace him.  Dr Bingle commented in his letter;

         "In summary, Dr Akram has already established himself as  a  highly
         valuable member of my  research  group  and  his  loss  would  have
         significant detrimental effects  on  the  important  work  that  we
         undertake at the University of Sheffield."

         I do conclude that this represents an unusually significant  aspect
         of the first Appellant's private life, which goes beyond the  sorts
         of links that students for example might make through a  course  of
         study, and that his research, its nature and his involvement in the
         specific research project being pursued at Sheffield University and
         which is linked to one at  Liverpool  University  is  a  matter  of
         unusual and considerable substance".

 8. He then went on to further conclude in paragraph 60,

         "It is the strength of his connection  with  the  project  and  his
         commitment to it which has formed, on a  private  life  basis,  the
         most significant argument in favour of the  three  Appellants.   If
         applications are made beyond 2016 then no doubt decisions  will  be
         reached one way or the other depending upon the facts as they  then
         are.  I would  not  wish  to  look  ahead  and  forecast  what  the
         situation might be in or after 2016.  It may  be  prudent,  though,
         for  the  two  adult  Appellants  to  contemplate  at   least   the
         possibility of a return to Bangladesh in the longer term".

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 9. Mrs Pettersen on behalf of the  Respondent  submitted  that  the  Judge
    misdirected himself in allowing the appeal on Article  8  grounds  when
    the Appellants could not meet  the  Immigration  Rules;  a  case  under
    Article 8 should only be  allowed  where  it  can  be  shown  that  the
    circumstances are exceptional in some way. Exceptional  is  defined  as
    circumstances in which although the requirements of the Rules have  not
    been met, refusal would result in an unjustifiably harsh outcome.

10. It was accepted by Ms Pettersen that the Judge allowed the appeal on  a
    very narrow basis - namely the first Appellant's research project.

11. Mr Brown on behalf of the Appellants referred to his Rule  24  response
    dated December 2013. Essentially, he submitted, the Judge  was  correct
    in his assessment, had given sufficient reasons for his conclusions  on
    the Article 8 assessment and therefore there  was  no  misdirection  or
    error of law disclosed. The decision should stand.

Has the Erred?

12. I am satisfied that the decision of Judge Hemingway discloses no  error
    of law. The determination demonstrates that the Judge applied his  mind
    to whether removal of the first Appellant (and therefore of the  second
    and  third  Appellants  whose  cases  are  dependent  upon  him)  would
    constitute an unjustifiable interference with his private life.

13. There is no suggestion that the Judge has based his  assessment  on  an
    inaccurate factual matrix. On the contrary the Judge has carefully  set
    out at paragraphs 35 to 59 of his  determination  his  reasons  why  he
    forms the conclusions he did.

14.  He  took  into  account  CDS  (Brazil)  [2010].  The  grounds  seeking
    permission do state "It is unclear what weight  should  be  applied  to
    research projects in the context of an article 8 assessment, but it  is
    submitted that that such undertakings would be akin to  employment.  It
    was found in CDS (Brazil) that there is "no human right to work" and it
    is submitted that this should extend to the first Appellant's  research
    project". There was nothing  put  before  me  to  show  why  the  first
    Appellant's research project should be treated as akin to employment.

15. The correct approach and the one adopted by the Judge is  not  to  view
    this case in stark terms of someone being  here  simply  to  work.  The
    Judge  had  evidence  from  Dr  Bingle  (the  Appellant's  Director  of
    Research) that there would be a substantial detriment to  the  research
    project being undertaken if the first Appellant could not  continue  in
    the UK as part of that research team. Public  money  has  already  been
    expended on this research project. That money may  well  end  up  being
    wasted should the first Appellant not be permitted to continue as  part
    of the research team. That evidence is unchallenged and clearly  formed
    part of the Judge's reasoning when he carried out  the  proportionality
    assessment.

16. That led the Judge to conclude, that to refuse  the  first  Appellant's
    Article 8 claim would on the facts as  he  found  above  result  in  an
    unjustifiably harsh outcome. In other words the facts of this case  met
    the exceptionality test as outlined by Mrs Pettersen.  That  assessment
    was open to the Judge for the reasons he gave.

17. For the foregoing reasons I find there is no error in the determination
    of Judge Hemingway.
