                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Oscar del  Fabbro),  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  12
    February,  to   a  dependent  relative  appeal  by  a  citizen  of  the
    Cameroons, born 26 July 1994, against refusal of a visa, for which  she
    had applied on 26 March 2012, on 24 May. The  entry  clearance  officer
    considered the application under paragraph 317 of  the  Rules,  dealing
    with dependent relatives over 18, and not paragraph 297, as  he  should
    have done; nor was this noticed, either by the person who  drafted  the
    original grounds of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal,  or  the  entry
    clearance manager who saw them and reviewed the decision.



 2. The judge dealt with the case under both paragraphs:  this  itself  was
    not to the appellant's disadvantage, as he considered 317, not  instead
    of, but as well as 297. However, it is now agreed  that  the  appellant
    was entitled to a decision on 297  from  the  entry  clearance  officer
    himself, having made her application when she was under 18; so I  shall
    do what the judge should have done (if only anyone had suggested it  to
    him) and declare that the application remains open for decision by  the
    entry clearance officer.

Appeal : entry clearance officer to reconsider application  under  paragraph
    297 of Rules
