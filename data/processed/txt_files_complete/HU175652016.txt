For the Appellant:     Mrs P Farrell, Peter G Farrell, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This appeal is brought against a decision by Judge of the First-tier
      Tribunal Handley dismissing an appeal on human rights grounds.

   2. The appellant is an Australian national.  She appealed against a
      decision by the respondent refusing her leave as a partner in a civil
      partnership.  The appellant and her partner, who is a student, did not
      meet all the income requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The
      respondent considered there were no insurmountable obstacles to the
      couple continuing to exercise the right to family life outside the UK.

   3. The Judge of the First-tier tribunal looked at the evidence of the
      couple's income.  This was a case in which the appellant and her
      partner were unable to provide the specified documents under the
      Immigration Rules to show the minimum income requirements were met.
      The appellant's partner maintained that she was unable to leave the UK
      because her elderly father, with whom the couple reside, requires her
      care.

   4. The judge of the First-tier Tribunal considered the "insurmountable
      obstacles" test under paragraph EX.1.  The judge noted that the
      appellant has lived most of her life in Australia and has family
      there.  She obtained a vocational qualification in Australia and was
      in employment there.  She entered the UK in 2014 with limited leave as
      a Tier 5 (youth mobility) migrant.  The judge was not satisfied that
      there were insurmountable obstacles to family life being carried on
      outside the UK.

   5. The judge noted that the appellant's partner's father is in receipt of
      DLA at the middle rate of care component and the lower rate of
      mobility component.  The judge accepted that the appellant's partner
      provides care for her father.  The judge noted, however, that the
      appellant's partner attends college three days a week.  When she is
      not able to care for her father he is cared for by someone else,
      normally her sister.  If no one was able to care for him he would be
      entitled to care from the social or health services.  The judge
      further noted that the appellant's partner is being treated for
      depression though there was little information about the extent of her
      condition or the treatment being provided.

   6. The judge accepted that the couple have a genuine and subsisting
      relationship.  The appellant has complied with UK immigration
      requirements.  Her work in the UK was making a positive contribution
      to the community.  However, there would not be very significant
      difficulties to continuing family life outside the UK which could not
      be overcome or which would entail very serious hardship.  There was
      not a strong or compelling claim to outweigh the public interest in
      maintaining effective immigration control.

   7. Permission to appeal was granted principally it appears on the basis
      that the judge arguably erred in making a proportionality assessment
      where the substantive requirement for a minimum income was in fact met
      although the judge had concurred with the respondent's view that the
      requirement was not met.  Arguably the judge should have carried out a
      more balanced assessment of proportionality having regard to the
      viability of the appellant's partner accompanying her to Australia or
      sponsoring an application by the appellant from Australia.  The judge
      further erred by failing to recognise that the appeal could be made
      only on human rights grounds, which arguably constrained the judge
      from making a robust Article 8 assessment.

Submissions
   8. At the hearing I was addressed on the question of whether the Judge of
      the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in his decision.  Mrs Farrell
      submitted that the question of whether the requirements of the
      immigration Rules were satisfied was not for the tribunal to decide
      but was a weighty factor in assessing proportionality, in terms of
      Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112.  The Judge
      of the First-tier Tribunal could have looked at new evidence on the
      appellant's earnings showing these were now �18,800.  The minimum
      income requirement would have already been met if the specified
      documents had been provided.  The judge failed to make a finding on
      whether the minimum income requirement was met in substantive terms.

   9. For the respondent Mrs O'Brien pointed out that Appendix FM of the
      Immigration Rules was intended to be the starting point for Article 8
      compliance.  Here there was an inability to meet the Appendix FM
      requirements.  In particular, evidence of the couple's finances was
      not in the specified form.  This was not a trifling technicality but a
      very clear requirement for administrative consistency.  The judge took
      into account that the evidence did not show the couple could meet the
      requirement of not being a burden on the public purse.

  10. Mrs O'Brien continued that the judge was clearly guided by the
      principles of the Immigration Rules.  He looked at Appendix FM and
      paragraph EX.1 and then considered the appeal outside the rules.  The
      decision was not disproportionate.  The judge took into account
      section 117B of the 2002 Act and had regard to compassionate factors.
      The appeal had no realistic prospect of success.

  11. In response Mrs Farrell referred to Suri [2017] CSIH 48.  The couple
      were clearly not a burden on the public purse.  On the question of
      whether the appellant's residence in the UK was precarious, Mrs
      Farrell referred to Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11.  The appellant had entered
      the UK with a lawful visa.  She has a good job with the Red Cross and
      makes a positive contribution to society.  If the couple had to
      relocate this would lead to costs for the care of the appellant's
      partner's father.  It was possible for the appellant to follow the 10
      year route to settlement under Appendix FM.  If the appellant had to
      make a further application she would not be allowed to work and this
      would cause hardship for her and her partner.  It would be
      disproportionate not to allow the appeal.

Discussion
  12. The first question I must address in this appeal is whether the Judge
      of the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.  If his decision does not
      disclose an error of law then the conclusions stand and there can be
      no alteration made to them.

  13. The judge properly considered first whether the requirements of the
      Immigration Rules were met in their entirety, not merely in substance.
       The judge considered whether paragraph EX.1 applied and the
      "insurmountable obstacles test" was met.  Then having found the
      appellant did not succeed under the Rules the judge considered the
      application of Article 8 outside the Rules.  It needs hardly to be
      stated, of course, that Article 8 is not to be used as a way of
      remedying a failure to satisfy the Rules in the absence of other more
      compelling considerations.  As the judge pointed out, there must be a
      strong and compelling claim to outweigh the public interest in
      maintaining effective immigration control.

  14. One of the strongest points made for the appellant and her partner was
      that they did in fact satisfy the minimum income requirement even
      though this was not established using the specified documents.  It was
      implied from this that the public interest in refusing the appellant
      leave would be substantially reduced.  At paragraph 20 the judge noted
      that the appellant's earnings at the relevant time were accepted as
      �17,360.  At paragraph 22 the judge referred to the appellant's
      partner's income from SSP of �5344 and from earnings of �2157, but
      pointed out that the documentary evidence of earnings did not satisfy
      the specified requirements.  It can be inferred from this that the
      judge was aware that the couple's income in fact exceeded the minimum
      income requirement even though the provisions of the Rules requiring
      specified documents were not met.  It does not follow from this that
      the judge was bound to allow the appeal outside the Rules under
      Article 8.  The judge had still to carry out the proper balancing
      exercise, having regard to section 117B.

  15. I accept that the way in which the judge set out the factors taken
      into account in the balancing exercise and expressed his reasons might
      have been capable of improvement.  The question though is whether the
      judge had regard to the relevant factors and gave adequate reasons.
      So far as these matters are concerned I am not persuaded that the
      decision shows any error of law on the part of the judge.

Conclusions
  16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve
      the making of an error on a point of law.

  17. The decision dismissing the appeal shall stand.

Anonymity
The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not make a direction for
anonymity.  I have not been asked to make such a direction and I see no
reason of substance for doing so.

Fee award             (N.B. this is not part of the decision.)
As the appeal has been dismissed no fee award can be made.
