                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Majid, JD Spicer Zeb Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent GA claims to be a national of Eritrea. The Secretary  of
    State  for  the  Home  Department  asserts  that  his  nationality   is
    "unknown".


 2. On the 10th October 2019 the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  AK  Hussain)
    allowed GA's appeal, having accepted that he holds a well-founded  fear
    of persecution in Eritrea. The Secretary of State now has permission to
    appeal against that decision, granted by Designated Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Shaerf on the 6th July 2019.



    Background and Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


 3. GA claimed asylum on the 3rd October 2017. He told officers that he was
    an Eritrean national  and  that  he  feared  serious  ill-treatment  if
    returned there - he was  a  Pentecostal  Christian,  and  he  had  left
    illegally. He  submitted  that  his  illegal  exit  would  be  punished
    severely,  with  adverse  political  opinion  being  imputed   to   his
    behaviour. This assertion was, it  is  accepted,  consistent  with  the
    country guidance:  MST and Others (national service - risk  categories)
    Eritrea CG [2016] UKUT 443 (IAC).


 4. Protection was refused on the 29th July 2019. For the purpose  of  this
    appeal the material part of the Secretary of State's reasoning  was  as
    follows [at �33]: "your claim to be an Eritrean national  is  unknown".
    This factual conclusion leads to the following assessment of  risk  [at
    �46]:

         "As it is not accepted that you have established  that  you  are  a
         national of Eritrea, consistent with the findings in MY above,  you
         are unable to demonstrate that you left the country  illegally.  It
         is therefore rejected that you will be persecuted for illegal  exit
         on return to Eritrea".


 5. It will be observed that the Secretary of State nowhere asserts that GA
    is Ethiopian.


 6. In its written decision the  First-tier  Tribunal  began  by  directing
    itself towards the relevant country guidance on Eritrea. It noted  that
    those who are of draft  age,  who  are  deemed  to  have  left  Eritrea
    illegally, face a real risk of persecution.  The Secretary of State had
    rejected GA's claim to have exited Eritrea  illegally  on  the  grounds
    that she did not accept him to be a national of that country; the First-
    tier Tribunal therefore proceeded to determine that issue.

 7. The Tribunal assessed the evidence offered that GA had, in the  company
    of a friend and witness, attended the Ethiopian embassy to try and  get
    them to give him some papers. It found that evidence to be wanting  and
    apparently attached no weight to it.  It went on however to  find  that
    the Secretary of State's reasons for rejecting GA's claimed nationality
    were "slim".  It found GA's detailed account of his life, his knowledge
    of Eritrea and his grasp of basic Tigrinyan all to be  consistent  with
    his claim to have been  a  national  of  that  country  who  had  spent
    considerable amounts of time  in  Ethiopia  and  Sudan.   It  therefore
    concluded that GA had proved his nationality to the lower  standard  of
    proof.  Having regard to his age, the Tribunal  was  further  satisfied
    that GA likely left Eritrea illegally and that if he returned today  he
    would be perceived to be a  draft  evader  and  punished  in  a  manner
    violating his human rights. The appeal was accordingly allowed.




    The Secretary of State's Appeal

 8. The Secretary of State submits that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is flawed for material error  of  law  in  that  the  Tribunal
    failed to apply the guidance in MA (Ethiopia) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  289.  The  Secretary  of  State
    contends  that  it  was  for  GA  to  demonstrate,  on  a  balance   of
    probabilities, that he is not  a  national  of  Ethiopia.   ST  (Ethnic
    Eritrean - Nationality - Return) Ethiopia CG  [2011]  UKUT  52  and  MW
    (nationality; Art 4 QD; duty to substantiate) Eritrea [2016] UKUT 00453
    (IAC) are cited to similar effect.




    Discussion and Findings


 9. As Mr Diwnycz realistically accepted before  me,  the  real  difficulty
    with the Secretary of State's grounds is that they are predicated on  a
    fallacy. The Secretary of  State  has  never  asserted  that  GA  is  a
    national of Ethiopia. Nor has she suggested that she intends to  remove
    GA to Ethiopia. There was therefore no  legal  obligation  upon  GA  to
    disprove such an assertion.  The refusal letter repeatedly states  that
    GA's nationality is  classified  as  "unknown".  As  the  Secretary  of
    State's  own  guidance  makes  clear,  the   only   burden   in   these
    circumstances is the burden upon GA to show that he is a refugee:


         Unknown  nationality  cases  (previously  described  as   'doubtful
         nationality')


         In unknown nationality cases, the Home Office is not asserting that
         the claimant holds a particular nationality. The  burden  of  proof
         rests with the claimant to show that they  qualify  for  protection
         under the Refugee Convention and the European Convention  on  Human
         Rights, including evidencing their  nationality.  The  standard  of
         proof that the claimant needs to meet is the lower  standard,  they
         just need to show a reasonable degree of likelihood (or real  risk)
         that they will face persecution.

    [From Nationality: disputed, unknown and other cases (Version 6.0  -  2
    October 2017)].


10. The Tribunal was therefore quite right to  determine  the  question  of
    nationality on the basis of the evidence before it,  and  applying  the
    lower  standard  of  proof.    MA  (Ethiopia)  is  concerned  with  the
    situation where the Secretary of State contends that an asylum claim is
    defeated by the claimant having an entitlement to protection of another
    state, and in particular where the Secretary of State intends to remove
    the claimant to that other state.  Neither of  those  situations  arose
    here. The Secretary of State had simply put  the  Respondent  to  proof
    about whether he could meet the definition  of  a  refugee  in  Article
    1(2)A  of  the  Convention.   This  included  proof  of   his   claimed
    nationality:


         "owing to well-founded fear of  being  persecuted  for  reasons  of
         race, religion, nationality,  membership  of  a  particular  social
         group  or  political  opinion,  is  outside  the  country  of   his
         nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is  unwilling  to
         avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having
         a nationality and being outside the country of his former  habitual
         residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing  to  such
         fear, is unwilling to return to it"


11. That being the case the question of  what  happened  at  the  Ethiopian
    embassy  was,  as  the  First-tier   Tribunal   found,   of   secondary
    significance. The  single  question  for  the  judge  was  whether  the
    Respondent had  demonstrated  that  he  was  Eritrean.  The  Judge  was
    rationally entitled to find that  burden  discharged  on  the  evidence
    before him, and for the reasons that he gives.




    Decisions


12. I find no error of law and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    upheld.

13. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"
