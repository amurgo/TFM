                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Immigration History

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Pakistan, whose date of birth is  12
    April 1983. His appeal against the decision of the Respondent to refuse
    his application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  migrant
    was dismissed under the Immigration Rules and under Article 8  ECHR  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Ferguson (the Judge), the reasons  for  which
    are contained within his determination promulgated on 12 March 2014.


 2. The only issue in dispute before the Judge was whether  the  Appellant,
    who relied on third party funds in support of his  application,  needed
    to provide a letter from the  bank  of  the  third  party,  confirming,
    pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 41-SD(a)(9) and (10):

         "(9) ...the amount of money provided to  the  applicant  from  any
         third party (if applicable) that is held in that institution; and

         (10) ...the name of each third party and  their  contact  details,
         including their full address including postal code, landline  phone
         number and any email address".


 3. As stated at [2] of the determination, the funds in question,  �50,000,
    were to be provided by a "...Mr Mohammed Usman Nawaz Choudhry, a family
    friend. In support of his application Mr Wasti provided  a  declaration
    from Mr Choudhry that he had made money available to Mr Wasti to invest
    in his business. A bank statement from Barclays bank showed that a  sum
    in excess of �50,000 was held in  an  account  in  Mr  Choudhry's  name
    between 22 February 2013 when it was  paid  into  his  account  and  24
    February, the last day for which the statement was available".

 4. The Judge decided that the provisions of paragraph 41-SD(i)(9) and (10)
    did apply to third party funds and dismissed  the  appeal.  The  appeal
    before me is against that decision. The application for  permission  to
    appeal was refused by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  application  was
    renewed to the Upper Tribunal on four grounds, namely  that  the  Judge
    did not have jurisdiction to  make  credibility  findings  because  the
    Respondent had explicitly chosen to reserve the right to assess whether
    the application was a genuine application;  that  the  Judge  erred  in
    finding that the Barclays bank statement submitted  did  not  meet  the
    requirements  of  paragraph  41-SD;  that  the  Judge  misapplied   the
    provisions of paragraph 41-SD because  the  Appellant  was  relying  on
    third party funding so he was not required to provide  a  bank  letter;
    and he did not give his "finding on the issue of construction or scheme
    of paragraph 41-SD(a) and 41-SD(b)", which was said in the  grounds  to
    be a "clear law point" that "requires an interpretation". Whilst in the
    grant of permission by the Upper Tribunal ground 2 is  referred  to  as
    having arguable merit, this must be a reference  to  ground  2  of  the
    grounds of application  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  which  were
    stated to be essentially the  grounds  relied  on  in  renewal  of  the
    application to the Upper Tribunal. It also appears that permission  was
    granted on all grounds because  'Overall  the  grounds  raise  arguable
    issues as to whether the lead (sic) First-tier Judge  was  entitled  in
    law to reach the conclusions that he did for the reasons given".

 5.  At the  outset  of  the  hearing,  I  asked  Mr  Iqbal  to  frame  his
    submissions so that he took into account the Upper  Tribunal  decisions
    in Fayyaz (Entrepreneurs: paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) - "provided to") [2014]
    UKUT 00296 (IAC),  Durrani  (Entrepreneurs:  bank  letters;  evidential
    flexibility) [2014] UKUT 00295 (IAC) and Akhter and another  (paragraph
    245AA: wrong format) [2014] UKUT 00297 (IAC), all of which  dealt  with
    the provisions of paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A, with the provisions of
    paragraph 41-SD, including construction or scheme  of  that  paragraph,
    considered initially in Fayyaz.


 6. Mr Iqbal in fact handed up Fayyaz but  also  the  unreported  decisions
    Arshad Iqbal and others  IA/20442/2012,  the  terms  of  the  grant  of
    permission by the Court of Appeal  against  that  decision  as  AI  and
    others   (C5/2013/2317),   and   the   unreported   decision    Shahzad
    IA/16789/2013. As to the grant of permission against AI and others,  it
    is stated therein that the issue as to  whether  an  Appellant  who  is
    relying on third party funding  must  comply  with  the  provisions  of
    paragraph 41-SD (a) or (b) or both (i.e,  whether  the  provisions  are
    alternative or cumulative requirements) was  a  'compelling  reason  to
    grant permission to appeal so that there was an authoritative ruling on
    the  proper  interpretation  of  rule  41-SD',  although  it  was   not
    considered that this ground of appeal had a strong prospect of success.
    The unreported determination  Shahzad  was  provided  by  Mr  Iqbal  to
    establish  the  differing  views  taken  by   tribunals   as   to   the
    interpretation of paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A. Mr Iqbal also provided
    a copy of the provisions of paragraph 244DD and paragraphs 35 to 43  of
    Appendix A, with the provisions of paragraph 41-SD set out  in  tabular
    form. Mr Iqbal confirmed that these documents had been provided to  the
    Upper Tribunal in Fayyaz.


 7. Fayyaz was heard and determined by the Upper  Tribunal  as  a  reported
    decision to provide guidance on the approach to be taken on  issues  of
    interpretation  of  paragraph  41-SD.  The  Upper  Tribunal  considered
    whether to defer the determination of the appeals before them until the
    outcome of the decisions of the Court of Appeal in AI (Pakistan) and UT
    (India), but gave reasons for proceeding at [5] of Fayyaz. In the  wake
    of Fayyaz, Mr Iqbal was asked in the context  of  his  submissions,  to
    state clearly which  arguments  had  already  been  put  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Fayyaz, and rejected.


 8. Having appeared to have taken on board my requirement that he frame his
    submissions to take into account the conclusions in  Fayyaz,  Mr  Iqbal
    nevertheless proceeded to take me through his  grounds  of  application
    before the First-tier Tribunal. When asked, however, if the submissions
    contained therein had been made to the Upper  Tribunal  in  Fayyaz,  he
    stated that they had. Mr Mills at this point, submitted that  I  should
    decide that his submissions had no prospect of  success,  were  without
    merit and that no further submissions should be made.


 9. I  asked  Mr  Iqbal  if  there  was  anything  within  his  grounds  of
    application before the First-tier Tribunal which had not  been  put  to
    the Upper Tribunal in Fayyaz. He said that he wished to take me through
    paragraphs 31 and 34 of the grounds, in which were set out the relevant
    questions from the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) application  form,  his  point
    being that an analysis of the application form, coupled with the  table
    of the provisions of Paragraph 41-SD (both of which  documents  he  had
    also provided to the Upper Tribunal) suggested that there was no  need,
    if the third party funds were in a bank account  in  the  UK,  for  the
    Appellant to provide a letter from the  bank  and  he  only  needed  to
    provide a bank statement. When asked again if this submission had  been
    made to the Upper Tribunal in Fayyaz, he stated that it had,  but  that
    the Upper Tribunal  had  not  reached  conclusions  on  it  within  its
    determination. My understanding of Mr Mills' submission on  this  point
    is that the Upper Tribunal had heard submissions and if the panel chose
    not to give weight to them it was a matter for them. Mr Iqbal  accepted
    that if reliance was to be placed on Fayyaz, it would be  'as  a  brick
    wall' to his submissions.


10. My real concern is that Mr Iqbal's  submission  on  the  basis  of  the
    provisions of the application form that a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  needed
    to complete was, as I stated during the hearing, simply  a  request  by
    him for a finding that  the  provisions  of  an  application  form  for
    further leave to remain should  override  the  requirement  within  the
    Immigration Rules for specified evidence to be adduced to establish the
    availability of funds. However, this submission had already  been  made
    to, considered and decided by the Upper Tribunal in Fayyaz.  He  stated
    that the Appellant was unfortunate as to the timing of his  appeal  and
    he really wanted a way in which an onward appeal could be  facilitated.
    However, the conclusions  in  Fayyaz  are  clear  and  the  purpose  of
    reported cases is to provide guidance to ensure consistency of decision
    making, even if they do not have the authority of starred decisions. Mr
    Iqbal had provided the same Table of requirements  and  made  the  same
    arguments linking the provisions of paragraph 41-SD to the  application
    forms that have to be completed by  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  applicants
    before the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  provisions  of  the  Rules  and  the
    application forms as a whole will have been  considered  in  detail  in
    Fayyaz. As the provisions of the application form were referred  to  in
    his submissions  to  lend  weight  to  his  submissions  regarding  the
    interpretation of the Immigration Rules, it is highly unlikely that the
    Upper Tribunal in Fayyaz would have overlooked them. As all matters had
    been comprehensively considered in Fayyaz, it follows that my  decision
    on the issues raised in the grounds in relation to  the  interpretation
    of paragraph 41-SD will be in line with Fayyaz, and the  related  cases
    Durrani and Ahmed and others, if I find that the Judge materially erred
    in law in his determination.


11. Mr Iqbal stated that he had no further submissions to make and Mr Mills
    relied on the Rule 24 response.


12. As to the various grounds of appeal, the first was that the  Judge  had
    made credibility findings at [21] - [23] which he was not  entitled  to
    make because the Respondent had explicitly chosen to reserve the  right
    to assess whether the application was a genuine application.  The  Rule
    24 response was that the Judge made sustainable  findings  of  fact.  I
    find that the Judge's reference to the intention of the Rules being  to
    "...assist the Secretary of State to be satisfied  that  the  applicant
    genuinely intended to invest funds in the business and that  the  money
    was genuinely available to the applicant and would remain available  to
    him until such time as it was spent by the business" was in the context
    of the submissions made before him by the Appellant's representative, a
    Ms Masood, which are recorded by him at paragraph [13].  He  cannot  be
    criticised for seeking to deal with the submissions made on  behalf  of
    the  Appellant  that  the  provisions  of  paragraph  41-SD   must   be
    interpreted in the light of the purpose of the Rule.  It  seems  to  me
    that he has dealt appropriately with this submission at [21] - [23] and
    has not improperly exercised jurisdiction which he did not have.


13. Ground two was put simply at paragraph 18 of the grounds of application
    before the First-tier tribunal as:


    "a) Since the Appellant is relying on money from a third party so (sic)
        paragraph 41-SD (a) does  not  apply,  rather  paragraph  41-SD  (b)
        applies; and


    "b) In the  alternative,  if  paragraph  41-SD  (a)  applies  then  the
        requirements under paragraph 41-SD (a) cannot be met, hence absurd."


14.  These  were  followed  by  five  detailed  reasons  to  support   this
    submission.


15. What is submitted in the grounds of application is that the Judge erred
    in failing to consider and make  a  finding  on  the  construction  and
    scheme  of  paragraph  41-SD  (a)  and  41-SD  (b).  This  however,  is
    incorrect. At that hearing, Ms Masood provided to the Judge a  copy  of
    Arshad Iqbal and others IA/20442/2012, in  which  an  analysis  of  the
    provisions  was  set  out  and  Ms  Masood  argued  for   a   different
    interpretation.  The Judge made it clear  that  it  was  an  unreported
    determination and therefore not binding on him and  would  not  be  the
    final analysis on the issue within his determination. However, his view
    was that there was no reason given by Ms Masood as to why what was said
    to be the 'plain meaning of the  rule'  should  not  be  followed.   He
    specifically found that nothing Ms Masood had submitted "...showed that
    the rule should be read differently." In particular, he found that  the
    words "provided to" (in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i)(9)) do not  plainly  mean
    money transferred to the applicant by a  third  party,  as  opposed  to
    money in the account of the third party but provided to  the  Appellant
    for his business [20]. This is consistent with  the  interpretation  of
    the provisions by the Upper Tribunal in Fayyaz (see headnote)


16. It is clear that the submissions made by the Appellant's representative
    were considered by the  Judge  and  he  reached  conclusions  on  those
    submissions that were open  to  him.  The  fact  that  the  grounds  of
    application  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  have   amplified   on   the
    submissions made to the Judge does not mean that the  Judge  was  wrong
    not to have  considered  them;  they  were  not  before  him  in  their
    amplified form. At one point in the  submissions,  Mr  Iqbal  submitted
    that the Judge had erred in law because he had relied on an  unreported
    determination. However, the Judge specifically states that he will  not
    be relying on it in the final analysis but  the  determination  clearly
    set out the plain meaning of the Rule. He then took  into  account  the
    submissions made on the Appellant's behalf by Ms Masood in reaching his
    conclusions. I find that there is  no  error  of  law  in  the  Judge's
    determination  in  relation  to  the  interpretation  of  the  relevant
    provision of paragraph 41-SD (i)(9). The absurdity argument was not put
    to the Judge and he cannot have erred in failing to consider it. Ground
    two is not made out.


17. I find that there is no material error of law in the  determination  of
    Judge Ferguson


18. For completeness, I would add that each of  the  submissions  Mr  Iqbal
    sought to make by reliance on the grounds  of  application  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal were considered by the Upper Tribunal in Fayyaz and
    Durrani; there is no need to re-examine in detail arguments which  have
    already been conclusively dealt with in those reported decisions and no
    good reason was provided by Mr Iqbal as to why I should depart from the
    guidance in those cases if I found there to be an error of law  in  the
    determination such that the decision must be set aside.  The  absurdity
    argument was rejected in Fayyaz at [27] and the lack of application  of
    paragraph 41-SD (a) to third party funds due to the particular  wording
    of paragraph 41-SD (a) (6) and 41-SD (a) (9) was rejected at  [28].  In
    Durrani, the Upper Tribunal considered  at  [9]  and  [11  -  15],  the
    application of these provisions to funds held by third  parties  in  UK
    banks which were to be made available to the applicant and  found  that
    such provisions did apply.



Decision

19. I find that there is no material error of law in the  determination  of
    Judge Ferguson and his decision must therefore stand.

Anonymity


20. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  No
    request has been made for an anonymity order and pursuant to Rule 14 of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 I find no reason  to
    make an order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (procedure) Rules
2005 and section 12(4) (a) of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note: Fee Awards in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011). As the appeal has been dismissed, no
fee award is made.
