For the Appellant:     Mrs Johnrose, Broudie Jackson & Canter
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq born in  1994.  He  appeals  with
       permission the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge AJ  Parker)
       to dismiss his protection appeal.

    2. In her refusal letter  dated  the  27th  March  2018  the  Respondent
       accepted that the Appellant is a citizen of Iraq, and that he  is  of
       Kurdish  ethnicity.  The  matters  in  issue  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal were (a) whether the Appellant was from a  'contested  area'
       such that he could not be expected to return  there  and  if  so  (b)
       could he nevertheless be reasonably expected to avail himself  of  an
       internal flight alternative?

    3. The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  took  place  in  November
       2018 when the operative country guidance on my question (a) above was
       AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 00544.   By that decision  the
       Tribunal had found that the city of  Tuz  Khurmato  in  Salah  al-Din
       Governate fell within the area  contested  by,  amongst  others,  the
       Islamic State and the government of Iraq. The Appellant claimed  that
       this was his home town. The Tribunal rejected that claim. It so found
       because the Appellant did not know the size of the population  there,
       and because he claims not to be able to speak  Arabic  (Tuz  Khurmato
       has a high population of Arabic  speakers).    The  Appellant's  case
       thereby  fell  at  the  first  hurdle.   The  Tribunal   nevertheless
       proceeded to determine my issue (b)  above.  It  concluded  that  the
       Appellant would have family in the Kurdish region who would  be  able
       to help him get a CSID and on that basis  found  internal  relocation
       would not be unduly harsh.

    4. The  appeal  was  thereby  dismissed  with  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       resolving both matters in issue in the Respondent's favour.

    5. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
       by Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman by his decision of the 22nd February
       2019. On the 21st October 2019  the  matter  came  before  me  for  a
       preliminary hearing,  at  which  the  Respondent  accepted  that  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal was flawed for error of  law  and
       must be set aside.  In light of that concession I state  my  findings
       on 'error of law', set out below, are stated briefly. The matter  was
       then adjourned pending promulgation of the new country guidance  case
       on Iraq. That  decision,  SMO  and  Others  (Article  15(c)  identity
       documents) Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 400, did not  become  available  until
       the 20th December 2019. The matter came back before me  on  the  10th
       February  2020.  I  heard  live  evidence  from  the  Appellant,  and
       submissions from the parties. I reserved my decision,  which  I  give
       below under the heading 'the re-made decision'.




       Error of Law

    6. As to issue (a) the findings are unclear, and arguably flawed  for  a
       misapplication of the standard of  proof.  At  paragraph  22  of  its
       decision the Tribunal uses the formulation "we cannot be sure  if  he
       comes  from  this  area".  It  would  be  somewhat  surprising  if  a
       Presenting Officer had invited the Tribunal to apply  that  standard,
       since it is trite that in  this  protection  appeal  the  appropriate
       question was whether "it is reasonably likely" that the Appellant  is
       from Tuz Khurmato.  At the beginning of  paragraph  26  the  Tribunal
       rejects the claim that the Appellant is  from  the  city  because  he
       cannot speak Arabic, yet finishes the paragraph with a  finding  that
       in fact he does.   Taking that contradictory  reasoning  out  of  the
       equation one is left with paragraph 23, where the Tribunal finds that
       the Appellant's failure to give an accurate figure for the population
       of Tuz Khurmato fatally undermines his claim  to  be  from  there.  I
       agree with Ms Johnrose that this is a tenuous  basis  upon  which  to
       reject a protection claim. I am doubtful whether most  people  living
       in Greater Manchester would be able to say what the population of the
       region is: that does not  mean  that  they  are  not  resident  here.
       Finally in its reasoning on this matter the Tribunal failed to  weigh
       in the balance the fact that the Appellant had been able to  describe
       incidents which we know to have occurred in Tuz Khurmato  in  October
       2017 (i.e. attacks on the Kurdish population by Hashd  al-Shaabi  and
       related Shi'a militias).

    7. The First-tier Tribunal did go on, in the alternative, to  deal  with
       issue (b). In doing so it entirely  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
       relevant country guidance case of AAH (Kurds -  internal  relocation)
       Iraq CG [2018] UKUT 00212 (IAC). Although it  directed  itself  to  a
       plethora of other  authorities,  in  omitting  to  consider  AAH  the
       Tribunal failed  to  have  regard  to  the  one  case  that  actually
       addressed the question of internal flight for Kurds, and specifically
       the likelihood that he would be able to obtain a CSID.




       The Re-Made Decision

    8. The decision in SMO has changed the landscape considerably. For  this
       appellant, it has  done  so  in  two  key  respects.  First,  it  has
       redefined the scope of the contested areas  where,  it  is  accepted,
       conditions on the  ground  are  such  that  Article  15(c)  pertains.
       Although it remains a scene of  significant  security  problems  [see
       paragraphs 262-265  SMO]  Tuz  Khurmato  is  no  longer  regarded  as
       'contested' and as such provides no foundation for the  Appellant  to
       claim humanitarian protection.   The Tribunal nevertheless went on to
       give guidance on an  entirely  new  factual  matrix  in  Iraq  -  the
       introduction of new biometric identity cards known as 'Iraqi National
       Identity Cards' (INIDs). Whether or not an appellant can  obtain  one
       of these cards within a reasonable time of arrival in Iraq  is  today
       relevant to the question of whether  he  qualifies  for  humanitarian
       protection under Article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive.

    9. Before me the parties were in agreement  that  pursuant  to  SMO  the
       first matter to be determined was what the Appellant's  circumstances
       will be upon arrival in Iraq.

   10. Tuz Khurmato is outside of the Kurdish region, and  as  such  Mr  Tan
       accepted that there appeared to be no prospect of removal  to  Irbil.
       As far as the Respondent is concerned the Appellant will  be  removed
       to Baghdad.

   11. I accept that the Appellant is not currently in possession of a CSID.
       That was also the finding of the First-tier Tribunal and it is not  a
       matter seriously contested by the Respondent.  The Appellant has been
       in the United Kingdom since December 2017  having  travelled  through
       the various  countries  of  Europe  with  the  assistance  of  people
       traffickers, whose modus operandi is known to be  the  divestment  of
       their customers' identity documents.   I further accept, for the same
       reason, that at present the Appellant has no Iraqi passport.   If  he
       did ever have one, it is reasonably likely that he does not  have  it
       now.

   12. The only way that the Respondent can therefore get the  Appellant  to
       Baghdad is if the Iraqi embassy in London issues the Appellant with a
       laissez-passer.  Neither party gave me any cause to doubt  that  such
       documentation would be issued upon request.

   13. So the Appellant will arrive in Baghdad with a laissez-passer. In SMO
       the Respondent had argued that a laissez-passer, or  alternatively  a
       letter of authority/certificate issued by the Iraqi authorities  upon
       arrival would enable the  Appellant  to  make  any  necessary  onward
       journey. The Tribunal rejected those  submissions,  its  findings  on
       that evidence set out in the headnote:

           "12.   A Laissez Passer will be of no assistance in the  absence
           of a CSID or an INID; it is confiscated upon arrival and is not,
           in  any  event,  a  recognised  identity  document.   There   is
           insufficient evidence to show that returnees are issued  with  a
           'certification letter' at Baghdad Airport, or to show  that  any
           such document would be recognised internally as acceptable proof
           of identity."

   14. The immediate difficulty for the Appellant will therefore  be  onward
       travel from  Baghdad.  In  an  unchallenged  finding  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had accepted that  the  Appellant  could  not  realistically
       remain in Baghdad, where he has no  connections  and  a  questionable
       ability to speak Arabic.  In order to get out of Baghdad airport  and
       make his journey north to the Kurdish region, the Appellant  needs  a
       recognised form of identification: see SMO and AAH.

   15. Before me Mr Tan  submitted  that  the  Appellant  could  obtain  the
       necessary documentation before he left the United Kingdom. He pointed
       out that the Tribunal in SMO appear to  conclude  that  it  is  still
       possible to get a CSID from the embassy in London [at �383]:

           "We have not been asked to revisit the extant  country  guidance
           on the way in which an individual  might  obtain  a  replacement
           CSID from within the UK, for which see [173]-[177] of AA  (Iraq)
           and [26] of AAH (Iraq).  We add only this: whilst  the  INID  is
           clearly replacing the CSID in Iraq, consulates do not  have  the
           electronic terminals necessary to issue the INID and continue to
           issue the CSID instead, as confirmed in a  Canadian  Immigration
           and Refugee Board  report  which  is  quoted  at  5.6.9  of  the
           respondent's   CPIN   entitled   Internal   Relocation,    civil
           documentation  and  returns,  dated  February  2019.   An  Iraqi
           national in the UK would be able to apply for a CSID in the  way
           explained in AA (Iraq) and, if one was successfully obtained, we
           find that it would be acceptable evidence  of  the  individual's
           identity throughout Iraq.  Notwithstanding the plan  to  replace
           the old CSID system with the INID by the end of 2019, we  accept
           what was  said  by  EASO  (in  February  2019)  and  the  Danish
           Immigration  Service  and  Landinfo  (in  November  2018),  that
           implementation was delayed and that the  CSID  was  still  being
           used in Iraq, and that it continues to be issued in those  parts
           of the country in which the INID terminals have not been  rolled
           out.  Given this evidence, and the fact that the CSID has been a
           feature of Iraqi society for so long,  we  do  not  accept  that
           there will come a time at the end of this  year  when  the  CSID
           suddenly ceases to be acceptable as proof of identity."

   16. Whilst the Tribunal in this passage clearly envisage that it  remains
       possible to obtain a  new  CSID  in  London,  the  likelihood  of  an
       individual successfully doing so must be read in light of Dr  Fatah's
       earlier evidence on the point, as set  out  in  the  earlier  country
       guidance cases. The passages in AA to which the Tribunal in SMO refer
       are these:

           "173.  As regards those who have an  expired  or  current  Iraqi
           passport but no CSID - Dr Fatah identifies in his  first  report
           that a CSID may be obtained through the "Consular section of the
           Iraqi Embassy in London",  which  will  send  a  request  for  a
           replacement or renewed  CSID  to  the  General  Directorate  for
           Travel and Nationality - Directorate of Civil Status. A  request
           for a replacement CSID must be accompanied, inter alia, by  "any
           form  of  official  document  in  support  of  the   applicant's
           identity" and the application form must be signed by  "the  head
           of the family, or the legal guardian or representative to verify
           the truth of its contents." He also added that an applicant must
           also authorise a person in Iraq to act as his representative  in
           order for that person to "follow  up  on  the  progress  of  the
           application".

           174.   However, Dr Fatah continued  by  explaining  that  if  an
           individual has lost his CSID and does not know the relevant page
           and book number for it, then the Iraq Embassy in London will not
           be able to obtain one on his behalf. Instead,  he  or  she  will
           have  to  attend  the  appropriate  local   office   of   family
           registration in Iraq or give a relative, friend or lawyer  power
           of attorney to obtain his or her CSID. The process of  a  giving
           power of attorney to a lawyer in Iraq to act  "as  a  proxy"  is
           commonplace  and  Dr  Fatah  had  done  this  himself.  He  also
           explained that the power of attorney could be  obtained  through
           the Iraq Embassy.

           175.   Dr Fatah gave further evidence to the effect that  having
           a marriage certificate may be useful as it  would  contain  data
           found in the family records. It is, however, not possible to use
           a "health card" in order to obtain a CSID because  there  is  no
           primary health care or GP system in Iraq, but  instead  patients
           attended hospital when they needed  to  do  so  and  no  central
           records are held.

           176.   There is a consensus between Dr Fatah's evidence and  the
           following more general evidence provided by UNHCR-Iraq in  April
           2015  on  the  issue  of  obtaining  CSID's  from  abroad.   "In
           principle, a failed asylum seeker, or indeed any  Iraqi  citizen
           abroad, can acquire Iraqi documents through Iraqi embassies  and
           consulates. There is a special authorization  granted  to  these
           bodies to provide documents for Iraqi abroad  on  the  condition
           that the beneficiaries should have any  available  documents  in
           order to prove their nationality."

           177.   In summary, we conclude that it is possible for an  Iraqi
           national living in the UK to obtain a CSID through the  consular
           section of the Iraqi Embassy in London, if such a person is able
           to produce a current or expired passport  and/or  the  book  and
           page number for their family registration details.  For  persons
           without such a passport,  or  who  are  unable  to  produce  the
           relevant family registration details, a power of attorney can be
           provided to someone in Iraq who  can  thereafter  undertake  the
           process of obtaining the CSID for such  person  from  the  Civil
           Status Affairs Office in their  home  governorate.  For  reasons
           identified in the section that follows  below,  at  the  present
           time the process of obtaining a CSID from Iraq is likely  to  be
           severely hampered if the person wishing to obtain  the  CSID  is
           from an area where Article 15(c) serious harm is occurring."

   17. That was the evidence in 2015. In 2018 Dr Fatah updated  it  for  the
       Tribunal in AAH:

           "26.   If applying through a consulate abroad  the  requirements
           are different. Having contacted the  consulate  in  London,  and
           checked on the website of the Iraqi embassy in Sweden, Dr  Fatah
           states that the authorities will require the applicant to  first
           make a statement explaining why he needs a CSID and attach  this
           to his application form, which must countersigned by the head of
           the applicant's family and stamped by the consulate or  embassy;
           he must then produce his Iraqi passport and proof of  status  in
           the country where he is applying, the name of  a  representative
           (proxy) in Iraq, an additional form completed by the head of the
           applicant's  family  verifying  that   the   contents   of   his
           application form were true, four colour copies of his  INC,  and
           10 colour photographs. Crucially the applicant must be  able  to
           produce something  which  can  establish  the  location  of  his
           family's details in the civil register. This should be  a  CSID,
           an INC or birth certificate. If none of these are  available  to
           the applicant he must  supply  the  identity  documents  of  his
           parents. This evidence  again  accords  with  that  of  Landinfo
           (December 2017) who conclude that it can be difficult to  obtain
           replacement  ID  documents  from  an  embassy  abroad  for   the
           individual who is unable to verify his or her identity.

           27.    If you  are  in  Iraq,  and  have  all  of  the  required
           documents,   in   normal   circumstances    the    process    is
           straightforward and quick and should take  no  more  than  three
           days. Dr Fatah's own daughter was born in the United Kingdom and
           he managed to obtain her a CSID in one day from  the  office  in
           Sulaymaniyah, upon payment of a small fee.  Dr  Fatah  was  less
           optimistic about the efficiency of the process if in the  United
           Kingdom. He has regular dealings with the  consulate  in  London
           and he is not impressed. He said that staff there are  generally
           very unhelpful.

           ...."

   18. Having taken all of that evidence into account I find  the  Appellant
       could provide a signed statement explaining why he does  not  have  a
       CSID. I assume for these purposes that he is in contact  with  family
       members in Iraq who would be  willing,  and  have  the  standing,  to
       countersign his application.   There would be no  difficulty  in  him
       providing  the  10  colour  photographs  required.  After  that   his
       application becomes more problematic.  In his research prior  to  AAH
       Dr Fatah made contact with the consulate in London and having done so
       he included in his list of necessary documents the individual's Iraqi
       passport and four colour photocopies of his INC. As  I  have  already
       found, this Appellant has neither of these items.   These  evidential
       requirements must be viewed in the context of the very  great  number
       of Iraqi nationals who are undocumented, and Dr Fatah's evidence (see
       AAH) that the embassy in London is  "generally  very  unhelpful"  and
       that  the  problems  of  an  individual  returnee  are  regarded   as
       "trivial".  I accept that it is reasonably likely  that  the  embassy
       would be unwilling or unable to process an application that  required
       any particular effort, for instance if the applicant's identity could
       only be verified with reference to records in Iraq.

   19. Accordingly I am satisfied that there is a reasonable likelihood that
       the Appellant will find himself at Baghdad airport with no  immediate
       means of onward travel. Without the  relevant  identity  document  he
       cannot board a domestic  flight  north,  or  pass  through  the  many
       checkpoints on the road.

   20. His next option would be to get a member of his family to  obtain  an
       identity document for him, and bring it to the airport.  It  is  here
       that the new evidence about INIDs set out in  SMO  becomes  relevant.
       The pertinent part of the headnote sets out the Tribunal's findings:

           "11.   The CSID is being replaced with  a  new  biometric  Iraqi
                National Identity Card - the INID.  As a general matter,  it
                is necessary for an individual to  have  one  of  these  two
                documents in order to live and travel  within  Iraq  without
                encountering treatment or conditions which are  contrary  to
                Article 3 ECHR.   Many of the checkpoints in the country are
                manned by Shia militia who are not controlled by the GOI and
                are unlikely to permit an individual without a  CSID  or  an
                INID to pass.  A valid Iraqi passport is not  recognised  as

           14.    Once in Iraq, it remains the case that an  individual  is
                expected to attend their local CSA office in order to obtain
                a replacement document.  All CSA offices have now re-opened,
                although the extent to which records have been destroyed  by
                the conflict with ISIL is unclear, and  is  likely  to  vary
                significantly depending on the extent and intensity  of  the
                conflict in the area in question.

           15.    An individual returnee who is not  from  Baghdad  is  not
                likely to be able to obtain a  replacement  document  there,
                and certainly not within a  reasonable  time.   Neither  the
                Central Archive nor the assistance facilities for  IDPs  are
                likely to render documentation assistance to an undocumented
                returnee.

           16.     The  likelihood  of  obtaining  a  replacement  identity
                document by the use of a proxy, whether from the  UK  or  on
                return to Iraq, has reduced due to the introduction  of  the
                INID system.  In order to obtain an INID, an individual must
                attend their local CSA  office  in  person  to  enrol  their
                biometrics, including fingerprints and iris scans.  The  CSA
                offices in which INID  terminals  have  been  installed  are
                unlikely - as a result of the phased replacement of the CSID
                system - to issue a CSID, whether to an individual in person
                or to a proxy.   The reducing number of CSA offices in which
                INID terminals have not  been  installed  will  continue  to
                issue CSIDs to individuals and their proxies upon production
                of the necessary information."

   21. The import of those findings for the Appellant is this. If the  civil
       registry in his home area is now issuing INIDs, his  appeal  must  be
       allowed, since he is caught in an administrative Catch-22 which  will
       leave him destitute and in conditions engaging Article 15(b):  unlike
       their predecessor CSIDs, INIDs cannot be issued to proxies, and so it
       would not be possible for anyone to get one,  and  bring  it  to  the
       Appellant.

   22. The next matter to be determined is therefore where the Appellant  is
       actually from.  As I have set out above, the First-tier Tribunal  was
       not satisfied that the Appellant was from Tuz  Khurmato  as  claimed.
       Having looked at all the evidence,  I  am  satisfied,  to  the  lower
       standard, that it is reasonably likely that he is from that  town  as
       he claims. I so find for the following reasons.  He has  consistently
       said that this was where is from. At the date that he arrived most of
       the Kurdish areas outside of the IKR were  in  'contested  areas'  so
       there was no particular reason for him to lie  about  that.  He  gave
       details about the town consistent with the background  evidence,  for
       instance  correctly  identifying  the  rough  size  of  the   Kurdish
       population, and being able to accurately estimate  the  driving  time
       from there to other nearby places.  His evidence about what  happened
       in Tuz Khurmato in the last few months before  he  left  in  2017  is
       consistent with the background evidence

   23. The final issue for consideration  is  therefore  whether  the  civil
       registry in Tuz Khurmato is still  under  the  old  CSID  system,  or
       whether it is one of the many urban centres that have  now  installed
       the new INID terminals.  In SMO the Tribunal was not  given  specific
       evidence on the locations of these terminals. As the  decision  makes
       clear, such a list would have been quickly outdated as the  programme
       is rolled out across the country. What the Tribunal is able to say is
       that it has been the towns and cities that have  been  provided  with
       terminals first: the Respondent's position before them was that CSIDs
       were still being issued in "rural areas"  [at  �389].   Even  in  the
       absence of specific confirmation that Tuz is one such a city, I  find
       it to be reasonably likely that it is so, for the following reasons.

   24. Tuz Khurmato falls at the southernmost tip of the areas  of  northern
       Iraq populated by Kurds - its mixed population includes Sunni Turkmen
       and Shia Arabs.  At one time it was part of the Kurdish governate  of
       Kirkuk, until Saddam Hussain hived it off to become part  of  largely
       Arab Salah al-Din.   As such it has been heavily contested for years.
         It fell under ISIL control in 2014, was retaken  by  the  Kurds  in
       2015, and in 2017 was the  scene  of  widespread  killing  and  human
       rights abuses as militias under the control of the Government of Iraq
       drove out the Peshmerga, and much of the Kurdish population.   During
       this period the area  suffered  "significant  infrastructure  damage"
       [see  SMO  �262];  we  know  that  ISIL  routinely  destroyed   civil
       registration offices [see AAH �104].   As such it appears likely that
       the existing registration infrastructure would have  been  destroyed,
       or at the very least seriously compromised. This being a  city  where
       the priority of the Government of  Iraq  is  to  consolidate  central
       control from Baghdad it is inconceivable to me that they would simply
       have replaced the old civil registry. It is far more likely that  the
       new system would have been installed.

   25. The consequence of that, for this Appellant, is that he has no  means
       of travelling from Baghdad to his home city where he could be  issued
       with new identity documents enabling him to work,  live  and  receive
       basic services. It is the Respondent's stated position  that  without
       such a card an Iraqi returnee faces  a  real  risk  of  falling  into
       destitution such that his living conditions would violate the  United
       Kingdom's obligations under Article 3 ECHR/  Article  15(b)  QD.  The
       appeal falls to be allowed on that basis.




       Anonymity

   26. The  Appellant  requires  international  protection.  As  such  I  am
       satisfied,  having had regard to the  guidance  in  the  Presidential
       Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders,  that  it  would  be
       appropriate to make an order  in  accordance  with  Rule  14  of  the
       Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  in  the  following
       terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  both  the
           Appellant and the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




       Decisions

   27. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains material  error
       of law and it is set aside.

   28. The decision in the appeal  is  remade  as  follows:  the  appeal  is
       allowed on protection and human rights grounds.

   29. There is an order for anonymity.
