Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms Benitez of Counsel, instructed by Howe & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal with permission  against  the  determinations  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Davda, promulgated on 26 July 2013  in  which
    she dismissed their appeals against the decision of the respondent made
    on 24 April 2012 to refuse to issue them with  EEA  family  permits  to
    come to the United Kingdom  as  the  dependants  of  Mary  Luz  Vallejo
    Rivillas and her husband Lorenzo Acanfora.

The appellants' case

 2. The first appellant, born 6 April 1959 is  the  mother  of  the  second
    appellant, born 27 June 1995.  Both  are  citizens  of  Colombia.   The
    first appellant is the mother  of  Miss  Vallejo-Rivillas;  the  second
    appellant is Miss Vallejo-Rivillas' brother.   It  is  the  appellants'
    case that they are dependent on the sponsor and that  accordingly,  the
    first appellant  is  entitled,  pursuant  to  Regulation  7(1)  of  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  ("the   EEA
    Regulations") as the dependent direct relative of the spouse of an  EEA
    national; and, in the case of the second  appellant,  as  the  extended
    family member of Mr Lorenzo Acanfora and thus  pursuant  to  Regulation
    8(2) as an extended family member of his and thus, both appellants  are
    entitled to family permits pursuant to Regulation 12.

The Respondent's case


 3. The respondent refused the applications on the basis that, although  it
    was accepted that funds were remitted to the appellants  and  had  been
    since January 2011, he was not  satisfied  that  either  appellant  was
    wholly or mainly dependent on the EEA citizen to meet either  of  their
    essential needs in Colombia.

 4. The respondent noted that the first  appellant's  own  income  exceeded
    that of the financial support provided by Mr Acanfora and that  was  in
    any event her own income, regardless of the  issue  of  any  additional
    amount she received from him was in excess  of  the  average  Colombian
    salary.

The appeals before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. Both appeals came before Judge Davda on 5  July  2013  when  she  heard
    evidence from the sponsors.  For reasons which are not at all clear and
    which have caused considerable difficulty the judge decided to  produce
    two  separate  decisions  despite  the  fact  that   both   cases   are
    inextricably linked.

 6. In her determination in respect  of  the  first  appellant,  the  judge
    directed  herself  on  the  applicable  law  [16],  [18]   noting   the
    differences between "family members" and "other family members"  noting
    that a distinction is to be  drawn  between  those  who  qualify  under
    Article 3.2 of the Directive, under which there is a duty to  undertake
    an extensive examination of personal circumstances.  After reciting the
    evidence the judge concluded: -

         "For all the above reasons and bearing in mind  Article  3.2(a)  of
         the EC Directive and the provisions of Regulation 12 of  the  [2006
         Regulations] I am satisfied the respondent had correctly undertaken
         the extensive examination of  the  personal  circumstances  of  the
         appellant and having given reasons for her refusal not to issue  an
         EEA  family  permit  to  this  appellant.   Having  considered  the
         evidence as at present, I find the appellant has not discharged the
         burden of proof upon her and therefore I find that the appellant is
         entitled neither to entry clearance [sic]  nor  to  an  EEA  family
         permit."

    In respect of the second appellant, the judge states: -

         "13. The appellant's mother Mrs  Luz  Mary  Rivilla  Rodriguez  has
             failed to meet the requirements of the  Immigration  (European
             Economic Area) Regulations 2006, therefore this appellant,  as
             her dependant, also  does  not  meet  the  requirements  under
             Regulation 12.

             I have borne in mind Article 3.2(a) of the  EC  Directive  and
             the provisions to Regulation 12 of the  Immigration  (European
             Economic Area) Regulations 2006, I am satisfied the respondent
             has correctly  undertaken  an  extensive  examination  of  the
             personal circumstances of this appellant and  his  mother  and
             given reasons for his refusal  not  to  issue  an  EEA  family
             permit to this appellant.

             Applying therefore the relevant law to the  established  facts
             and then reminding myself that the standard of  proof  is  the
             balance of probability I am satisfied on the  evidence  before
             me that this appellant has not met  the  requirements  of  the
             Immigration Rules.  For this reason I dismiss the appeal."

 7. The appellants sought permission to appeal against this decision on the
    grounds:

      i) that Judge Davda materially erred by failing to consider the second
         appellant's appeal;

     ii) despite restating the respondent's case failed to  make  any  clear
         findings on the first appellant's case in respect  of  any  of  the
         material aspects making no findings regarding the ownership of land
         said by the sponsor to belong to her and not the  first  appellant;
         and

    iii) stated that money transfer evidence  would  not  be  considered  as
         details had not been provided as to how the money was spent.

Hearing before the Upper Tribunal on 1 November 2013

 8. When the matter first came before me, it became apparent that  although
    a copy of the determination in respect of the second appellant had been
    sent to him, it had not been sent either to the respondent  or  to  the
    appellants' solicitors; both were unaware of its existence.

 9. With the agreement of the parties, I considered that it was appropriate
    to proceed on the basis that the grounds of appeal lodged in respect of
    the first appellant  as  an,  albeit,  out  of  time,  application  for
    permission  to  appeal  against  the  decision  dismissing  the  second
    appellant's appeal.  I therefore constituted myself as a Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal to consider that application.  I was satisfied that
    neither the respondent nor the appellants' solicitors had been properly
    served with the determination in respect of  the  first  appellant  and
    were unaware of its existence (as is clear from the grounds of appeal).
    I  concluded,  therefore,  that  it  would  be  appropriate  in   these
    exceptional circumstances to admit the application out of time.   I  am
    satisfied also that it was arguable that the judge had made  inadequate
    findings and simply recited the respondent's case  without  considering
    the matter herself.

10. It was rightly accepted by the respondent that the determinations  were
    wholly inadequate in failing to reach findings of  fact  and  therefore
    disclosed a clear error of law.  It  was  also  accepted  that  in  the
    circumstances there were no facts or findings of fact to  be  preserved
    and that the matters would as a result have to be reheard afresh and  I
    therefore adjourned the matter for a full  hearing  on  all  issues  de
    novo.

Hearing on 4 December 2013

11. I heard evidence from both sponsors as  well  as  submissions  from  Ms
    Benitez and Mr Jarvis.  In addition I had the following before me:

         (a)  appellants' consolidated bundle;

         (b)  respondent's  bundle,  including  explanatory  statements  and
             notices of refusal;

         (c)  appellants' supplementary bundle;

         (d)  Ms Benitez' skeleton argument.

Oral evidence

12. The sponsor gave evidence in Spanish through a court interpreter.  This
    was  not  without  its  difficulties  given  a  significant  degree  of
    incomprehension  between  the  sponsor  and  the  interpreter  who  was
    apparently less familiar with Latin  American  Spanish.  Despite  these
    problems, neither representative submitted that the interpreter  should
    be discharged.

13. The sponsor adopted her witness statements  adding  that  her  mother's
    business is registered at her own residential address,  Correa  82A  21
    and that she has no other premises that  she  uses  for  cooking.   She
    explained that she had said in her witness statement that her  mother's
    business was not an ongoing concern and had a "limited  shelf-life"  as
    her sales were becoming less and  less  over  time  because  people  in
    Colombia wished to make their own products in their  own  kitchens  and
    due to the economic situation.  She said that her  mother's  accountant
    had said the business had ceased to be registered, and her  mother  had
    decided to do that because the taxes she had to pay  were  higher  than
    the income, explaining that she had to pay a percentage  of  income  to
    the government in order to be registered.

14. The sponsor said that there were two different receipts for  the  taxes
    on the current property as one covered the main  house  and  the  other
    covered a utility annex.  She said the gas bills  varied  according  to
    consumption and the bill was in her name as she is the property  owner.
    She said in addition, as the house is in a gated community, she has  to
    pay 260,000 pesos a month in charges and security.  She said  that  the
    bill is in the name of Dora Acevedo as she is the  previous  owner  and
    the administrators of the estate had not changed the bill to  her  name
    yet.  She referred me to the deed of sale confirming the  sale  of  the
    property to her from Dora Acevedo.

15. The sponsor also identified in the bundle telephone bills, her mother's
    health card in the bundle, explaining that she  pays  220,000  pesos  a
    month to the state insurance fund.  She estimated the food expenses  at
    a total of 150,000 pesos per month.

16. Turning to the second appellant, the sponsor said that she paid for his
    fees each year but that she was yet to receive confirmation of the most
    recent year.  She said he had just finished at secondary  college,  and
    that there are additional expenses in addition to  the  fees,  uniform,
    books and food which she also meets.

17. The sponsor said that her mother owns a separate flat which  is  small,
    approximately 30 square metres in area, consisting of one room which is
    not currently let out.  She said there was tax payable on that  but  it
    is much less than the other house, the purchase price of which had been
    150 million pesos, the purchase price of the flat being 4.5 million.

18. The sponsor explained  that  the  large  transfer  of  money  in  2011,
    �25,000, was to pay to repair the main house which had been damaged  by
    damp and the roof had had to be removed and replaced.

19. In cross-examination the sponsor said that the house she owns in  which
    her mother and brother live has four bedrooms over three  floors.   She
    said it is approximately 175 to 180 square metres in area, is  a  gated
    property with around 60 houses and  communal  grounds.   She  said  she
    bought the house in 2011 and before that, the appellants had  lived  in
    another house which was also her property where they  had  lived  since
    December 2010.  She said that her mother and brother had never lived in
    the small flat as it is only a one-room property and had been  occupied
    by her older brother who had been killed four months ago.  She said  it
    was very small which is why they could not live  in  it.   The  sponsor
    said that her brother is not working despite that he has now turned 18.

20. Asked about the document at page 154A of the bundle,  setting  out  the
    cancellation of the registration of her mother's work,  she  said  that
    the 6 November 2013 date referred to the  date  on  which  the  licence
    would have to have been renewed not that it had been  renewed  and  she
    said the original documents were all in Colombia, and she had been sent
    scans by email.

21. It was put to the appellant that in her last witness statement she  had
    said that her mother earned approximately �150 per month but  that  the
    letter from the accountants suggests she earns approximately  �200  for
    the last two months.  She said it depends on the exchange rate and that
    her mother has no other source of income.  She said that her mother has
    not tried to set up another business or find work as she  suffers  from
    arthritis.  She says she had no medical evidence about it  as  she  had
    not thought it would be important.

22. There was no re-examination.  In response to my questions the appellant
    said that the tax on their property was as high as  �680  per  calendar
    month because of its location, size and  the  security  provided.   She
    said that the telephone bills were not so  big  as  it  appeared.   She
    confirmed  that  the  food  bill  for  her  mother  and   brother   was
    approximately �700 a month submitting  that  she  spends  approximately
    �800 a month for her family of three saying that the  cost  per  person
    per month in Colombia was a little bit lower than one might  be  likely
    to pay in the United Kingdom.

23. I then  heard  evidence  from  Mr  Acanfora  who  adopted  his  witness
    statement adding that he was aware that the first appellant had  had  a
    catering business for a long time; when they had first met she had  had
    quite a good time but quite dramatically in the  last  four  years  the
    income had gone down and there was no sense in keeping on employees  or
    the business structure as it was not making as much  money  as  before.
    He said that since he and his wife had started living together in  2009
    he had started sending money to the appellants.  He  said  that  before
    his wife had come to the United Kingdom, she  had  helped  support  her
    family in Colombia and since she had come  here  they  had  started  to
    support them, paying for the second appellant's school fees.

24. In cross-examination Mr Acanfora said that his mother-in-law has a tiny
    studio flat which is currently vacant and had previously been  used  by
    her son who had recently been killed.

Submissions

25. Mr Jarvis relying on the refusal notices submitted the appeal should be
    dismissed and submitting that, relying  on  the  opinion  of  Advocate-
    General Mengozzi in Reyes v Migrationsverket [2014] CJEU C-423/12 proof
    of support was not  sufficient  and  it  was  necessary  to  show  that
    essential, that is basic needs, were being met (see paragraphs  53  and
    58) and the amount of the expenses which required to be paid,  such  as
    the property taxes and so on related to the fact that they were  living
    in a large house, owned by the sponsor and that in order  to  make  out
    dependency, the appellants would need to show that they  would  not  be
    able to reside in alternative accommodation.  He submitted further that
    there was need for a close  and  careful  assessment,  with  particular
    regard to Regulation 8 and it should be taken into account whether  the
    second appellant was capable of working  himself.   He  submitted  that
    other family members were to be subjected to a closer  examination  and
    that circumstances,  -  the  mother  having  been  in  employment,  had
    changed.

26. Turning to the evidence, Mr Jarvis submitted that limited weight  could
    be attached to the documentary evidence given that most of it  had  not
    been translated and that there  were  no  direct  statements  regarding
    dependency from either appellant.

27. In reply, Ms Benitez submitted that there were two principal  questions
    to be answered: first, whether the appellants are genuinely  dependent;
    and, second, is the money remitted to them necessary to cover essential
    needs.

28. Ms Benitez submitted also that  in  any  event  the  first  appellant's
    income was just over �4,200 and that since then the business has had to
    shut down.  On that basis, even basic needs in Colombia  could  not  be
    met and that there was no authority for the proposition that  in  order
    to show dependency, the individual must  show  that  they  are  at  the
    breadline.  Miss Benitez pointed out that even on the respondent's  own
    figures as to average salary in Colombia, approximately �350  a  month,
    would be needed.

29. Ms Benitez submitted that what is to be considered  is  the  particular
    appellant and that particular appellant's needs.  It cannot be expected
    for somebody who comes from an affluent background to give that up  and
    to reduce themselves to a level of poverty.  She submitted the evidence
    of the sponsor had not been challenged to any great degree  and  whilst
    agreeing that some of the costs appear excessive, even taking  some  of
    that out there  was  still  a  huge  amount  of  money  required.   She
    submitted that even taking into account health insurance, phone  bills,
    gas and electricity, as well as tuition fees it was evident that it was
    only with the funds transferred by the sponsor that these could be  met
    and accordingly the appeal should be allowed.

30. I reserved my determination but prior  to  promulgating  it,  the  CJEU
    handed down its decision in Reyes.  I had  directions  issued  to  both
    parties inviting them to make submissions on that matter, or  to  state
    that they did not intend to make submissions.  The respondent  has  not
    replied; Ms Benitez made further written submissions.

Remaking the decisions

31. Although the appellant is overseas, as the application concerns an  EEA
    family permit, this is an appeal to which Section 85(4) of the 2002 Act
    does not apply.  I  am  therefore  entitled  to  consider  material  or
    circumstances which have arisen after the date of decision.

32. The issue in dispute is whether the appellants cans show that they  are
    "dependent" for the purpose of, in the case  of  the  first  appellant,
    Regulation 7 of the EEA Regulations and, in  the  case  of  the  second
    appellant, Regulation 8 of the said regulations, it being stated in the
    respondent's review

         "The [second] appellant applied to join  his  sister  and  her  EEA
         (Italian) husband in the UK.  Given that the appellant is  applying
         to join his sister's husband he is correctly being considered as an
         extended dependent family member of an EEA national.  In  order  to
         qualify for entry clearance he must therefore demonstrate  that  he
         is 'dependent on his EEA national brother-in-law or sister' ".

33.  The  differences  between  the  two  categories,  those  of  dependent
    relatives in the ascending line and other family members  is  reflected
    in the Directive which permits member  states  to  make  an  "extensive
    examination of the personal circumstances" of an applicant in the  case
    of other family members.  (See Rahman  and  Others  [2012]  C-83/11  at
    [19], [23] and [24].

34. The situation for dependent family relatives is different.  In Jia   it
    was held

         "In order to determine whether the relatives in the ascending  line
         of the spouse of a community national are dependent on the  latter,
         the member state  must  assess  whether,  having  regard  to  their
         financial and social conditions, they are  not  in  a  position  to
         support themselves.  The need for material support  must  exist  in
         the state of origin." [37]

35. It is clear (see Lim (EEA -dependency) [2013] UKUT 437 (IAC)) that  the
    question of dependency is one of fact, that is  "Is  the  applicant  in
    fact dependent on the EEA sponsor?"  That does not permit the  question
    "Is the  applicant  wholly  or  mainly  financially  dependent  on  the
    sponsor?"

36. In Reyes, the CJEU held:
       20     In that regard, it must be noted that, in order for a  direct
       descendant, who is 21 years old or older, of a Union citizen  to  be
       regarded as being a 'dependant' of that citizen within  the  meaning
       of  Article  2(2)(c)  of  Directive  2004/38,  the  existence  of  a
       situation of real dependence  must  be  established  (see,  to  that
       effect, Jia, paragraph 42).
       21      That dependent status is the result of a factual  situation
       characterised by the fact that  material  support  for  that  family
       member is provided by the Union citizen who has exercised his  right
       of free movement or  by  his  spouse  (see,  to  that  effect,  Jia,
       paragraph 35).
       22      In order to determine the existence of such dependence, the
       host  Member  State  must  assess  whether,  having  regard  to  his
       financial and social conditions, the direct descendant,  who  is  21
       years old or older, of a Union citizen, is  not  in  a  position  to
       support himself. The need for material support  must  exist  in  the
       State of origin of that descendant or the State whence  he  came  at
       the time when he applies to join that citizen (see, to that  effect,
       Jia, paragraph 37).
       23      However, there is no need to determine the reasons for that
       dependence or therefore for  the  recourse  to  that  support.  That
       interpretation is dictated in particular by the principle  according
       to which the provisions, such as Directive 2004/38, establishing the
       free movement  of  Union  citizens,  which  constitute  one  of  the
       foundations of the European Union, must be construed  broadly  (see,
       to that effect, Jia, paragraph 36 and the case-law cited).
       24      The fact that, in circumstances such as those in question in
       the main proceedings, a Union citizen regularly, for  a  significant
       period, pays a sum of money to that descendant, necessary  in  order
       for him to support himself in the State of origin,  is  such  as  to
       show that the descendant is in a real situation of dependence vis-�-
       vis that citizen.
       25      In those circumstances, that descendant cannot be required,
       in addition, to establish that he has tried without success to  find
       work or obtain subsistence  support  from  the  authorities  of  his
       country of origin and/or otherwise tried to support himself.

37. The first question which must be asked is what  are  the  essential  or
    basic needs of the applicant.  That is of course a question of fact and
    is likely to vary between individuals.  There is  no  requirement  here
    that this benchmark  should  or  could  be  subsistence  level  in  the
    relevant country.

38. There is no authority for the proposition, certainly in the context  of
    EU law, for Mr Jarvis' submission that the benchmark in this case would
    be a consideration of a smaller property. Still less can it properly be
    argued that at age 18 the second appellant could share the same  single
    room apartment as his mother.  Further,  and  in  any  event,  for  the
    reasons  set  out  below,  I  find  that  the  appellant's  income   is
    insufficient to meet their basic needs, even before housing  costs  are
    factored in, without the support of the sponsor.

39.  With  regard  to   the  second  appellant  as  regards  the  issue  of
    dependency,  it  would  be  difficult,  artificial  and  impossible  to
    consider basic needs in his circumstances on an abstract basis based on
    an assumption that he is not living as part of the  same  household  as
    his mother.

40. The starting point in assessing whether the appellants are dependant is
    their income. I accept from the documentary evidence  and  that  of  Mr
    Acanfora and the sponsor that the  second  appellant  is  in  full-time
    education and is not working. I accept he has no income.

41. The position of the first appellant is less clear.   The  case  put  is
    that while she had  her  own  business,  and  was  (as  the  respondent
    accepted) earning the equivalent of approximately  �4200,  that  is  no
    longer the position. Her income has  decreased,  it  is  said,  because
    there is less demand for her services and her  trade  registration  has
    been cancelled.

42. While there was a significant amount  of  cross-examination  about  the
    latter, the utility of questioning a  witness  through  an  interpreter
    about a translation of a document  is  questionable.   Looking  at  the
    document which is a certificate issued on  7  November  2013  recording
    that documents dated 5 November 2013 were "inscripted"  on  6  November
    2013.  While there is a reference to a renewal date, that appears to be
    the date on which the registration ended and from which it  was  to  be
    renewed. I do not consider that it is an inconsistency.

43. There is at page 22 a letter from  the  first  appellant's  accountant,
    estimating her monthly income at 600,000 pesos. That letter is dated 15
    March 2013. The same accountant has also said  (page  156)  in  another
    letter dated 8 November 2013 stating that the income was about  600,000
    pesos in the previous six months.  That  is  a  substantial  reduction.
    600,000 Pesos is said to be the equivalent of  approximately  �200  per
    month according to the sponsor in her witness statement of 1 July  2013
    or �300 according to her witness  statement  of  23  April  2013.  This
    discrepancy is said to be due to fluctuations in the exchange rate.

44. It is evident from the money transfers contained within the appellants'
    bundle that the  exchange  rate  has  fluctuated  considerably,  and  I
    consider that this explanation is plausible.

45. The  sponsor's  evidence  was  somewhat  confused  although  given  the
    difficulties with the interpreter, it would not be appropriate to  draw
    adverse inferences. On reflection, there appears to have been confusion
    over whether food costs were 1,500,000  pesos  per  month  and  150,000
    pesos per month. There were also doubt as to whether  some  bills  were
    monthly or bi-monthly

46. That said, the first appellant's income and the closure of her business
    is confirmed by the documentary evidence. While it is for the most part
    photocopies, I have no reason to doubt that they  are  accurate  and  I
    accept that, given the volume of documents, sending the originals which
    are in many cases computer-generated is unlikely to  add  much  to  the
    evidence.

47. I accept the explanation from the first  appellant's  accountant  which
    was confirmed by Mr Acanfora that the first appellant's business is  no
    longer viable. She is, I accept,  now  in  her  50s  and  the  economic
    situation in Colombia is not good. It is difficult to  see  what  other
    employment she could find; it  is  not,  however,  in  light  of  Reyes
    necessary to speculate about that.

48. I find no indication in the evidence  that  the  appellants'  have  any
    sources of income apart from  the  wages  from  the  first  appellant's
    business and funds transferred to them by the sponsor.

49. I am prepared to accept that through no fault of  her  own,  the  first
    appellant's income has reduced considerably to in the region  of  about
    100,000 pesos a month.  That is well below the average  wage  according
    to the respondent's own figures; indeed the earlier figure  of  600,000
    pesos per month is below that.  I accept also, in the light of the oral
    evidence, that the �25,000 transferred in 2011 was to pay  for  repairs
    to the house .

50. There is, as Mr Jarvis submitted, a  significant  difficulty  with  the
    evidence of the appellants' expenditure in  that  much  of  it  is  not
    translated and much of it requires additional evidence of  the  sponsor
    to give it weight.

51. That said, it is evident  that  the  second  appellant's  school  fees,
    receipts for which are provided (pages 113-118) are in the region of  2
    million pesos per annum. I accept that that is a necessary expenditure.
     The telephone bill (page  102)  in  the  first  appellant's  indicates
    payments of over 100,000 pesos a month.

52. While for the reasons set out above,  I  consider  that  the  sponsor's
    evidence as to the appellants' expenditure is not entirely reliable, it
    is inevitable that they  will  have  to  meet  the  costs  of  heating,
    lighting, water and food.   I consider also that  in  a  case  where  a
    state does not provide free  health  care  that  the  costs  of  health
    insurance would come within essential needs.  These would be on top  of
    the costs of telephone and schooling.

53. Here, given the very low level of the appellant's income, less than one
    sixth  of  the  average  wage,  I  am  satisfied  on  the  balance   of
    probabilities that those essential costs which the appellants  have  to
    meet are well in excess of their income, and that thus they require the
    financial support of the sponsor to meet  their  essential  needs,  and
    thus they are dependant for the purpose of EU law.

54.  Accordingly,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  appellants  do   meet   the
    requirements of the EEA Regulations and are entitled to be issued  with
    family permits. I therefore allow the appeals on that basis.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

 1. The decisions of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve  the  making  of
    errors of law and I set them aside.

 2. I remake the decisions by allowing the appeals  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.
