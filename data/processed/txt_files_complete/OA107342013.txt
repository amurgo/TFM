Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Walker (Home Office Presenting
      Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Collins, Counsel, instructed by
      Breytenbachs Immigration Consultants


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant, born April 30, 1969 is a citizen  of  South  Africa.  On
    February 25, 2013 she submitted an application for entry clearance as a
    fianc�e of the  sponsor,  Kieran  Moore.  The  respondent  refused  his
    application under  the  Immigration  Rules  on  March  15,  2013  under
    Appendix FM and in particular section E-ECP 1.1(d).

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on May 3, 2013.  On
    August  14,  2014  Judge  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal   Bart-Stewart
    (hereinafter referred to as  the  "FtTJ")  heard  her  appeal.  At  the
    hearing both representatives agreed that  the  respondent  should  have
    considered this under paragraph 290 HC  395  because  the  transitional
    provisions contained in paragraph A280 of part  8  of  the  Immigration
    Rules applied. In a determination promulgated on September 19, 2014 the
    FtTJ found the decision was not in accordance  with  the  law  and  she
    allowed the appeal to the extent that the application would be remitted
    to the Entry Clearance Officer to  make  a  fresh  decision  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 4. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on September 26,  2014  and  on
    November 3, 2014 Upper Tribunal Judge Martin sitting as a Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal  finding  it  arguable
    the FtTJ may have erred by taking the decision she did because  it  was
    arguable the transitional provisions only  applied  to  members  of  HM
    Armed Forces.

 5. There was no Rule 24 response filed by the  appellant  and  the  matter
    came before me on the above date. The sponsor was in attendance and was
    represented.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 6. Mr Walker and Mr Collins agreed that the  grounds  of  appeal  did  not
    disclose any error in law.


 7. Paragraph A280(d)(i) of Part 8 of the Immigration rules states:


            "The following provisions  of  Part  8  continue  to  apply  to
            applications made on or after 9 July 2012 and are  not  subject
            to any additional requirement listed in (b) above,  by  persons
            who have made an application  for  entry  clearance,  leave  to
            enter or remain  as  the  fianc�(e),  proposed  civil  partner,
            spouse, civil partner, unmarried partner, same sex partner,  or
            child or other dependent  relative  of  a  British  citizen  or
            settled person who is a full-time member of HM Forces."


 8.  Both  representatives  agreed  that  these   provisions   caught   the
    appellant's application because the sponsor was a British  citizen.  It
    was not a requirement of the Rules that the British citizen had to also
    be a member of HM Armed Forces despite the content of  the  grounds  of
    appeal.


 9. Mr Walker confirmed that he did not intend to  pursue  the  grounds  of
    appeal and invited me to dismiss the appeal.

10. I considered the grounds and the provisions  and  I  am  satisfied  the
    requirement to be a member of the Armed  Forces  only  applied  if  the
    sponsor was a person settled in the United Kingdom. The appellant was a
    British citizen and the requirement to be a member of the Armed  Forces
    did not apply in this appeal.

11. I find there is no error in law.

12. Mr Collins asked me to make a wasted costs  order  but  I  refused  the
    application because the respondent had been given permission to  appeal
    and there had been a failure by the appellant's solicitors  to  file  a
    Rule 24  response.  I  was  not  satisfied  the  respondent  had  acted
    unreasonably in bringing these proceedings.

    DECISION


13. There was no material error of law I uphold the original decision.


14. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
