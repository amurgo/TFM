                                                                   Appellant
                                     and


               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. On 26th April I wrote to the parties as follows:-

        "I have reviewed the file in this case.  Permission to appeal  to
        the Upper Tribunal was  granted  on  the  apparently  meritorious
        ground that the First-tier Tribunal decided  the  appeal  without
        taking into account the compendious bundle of documents submitted
        on the appellant's behalf by her solicitors.


        In the circumstances it appears to me  that  the  appeal  to  the
        Upper Tribunal should be allowed and the appeal remitted  to  the
        First-tier Tribunal to be determined by a different  judge.   Any
        proposal to the contrary will be considered if received within 21
        days of the date of this letter."
 2. The appellant's representatives  have  indicated  their  agreement;  no
    response has been received from the respondent.

 3. I accordingly allow this appeal to the Upper Tribunal,  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the appellant's appeal to
    be considered afresh by a judge other than Judge Birkby.

 4. I direct that the appeal be listed for  oral  hearing  in  the  Glasgow
    hearing centre.
