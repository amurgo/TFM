                              BAHRAM GHORBALOU
                            (Anonymity not made)
                                                                  Respondent

For the Respondent: Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Appellant: Ms K Stein, Advocate, instructed by Quinn, Martin &
Langan, Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as above, but the rest of this determination refers  to
    them as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The SSHD appeals against a decision by FtT Judge Beg, promulgated on 12
    January 2017, purporting to allow the appellant's appeal "to the extent
    that it is re-considered by the respondent and a fresh decision made".

 3. The case to which the Judge referred at �8 does not justify the outcome
    which she reached.  Further, that case was decided under the scheme  of
    appeal rights pre-dating their most recent amendment.

 4. The statutory grounds of appeal available under s. 84 (1) of  the  2002
    Act as from 20 October 2014, and the obligation on the  tribunal  under
    s. 86 to determine those grounds, do not extend to an outcome  such  as
    the Judge purported to reach.

 5. The Judge at �3 admitted  a  medical  report  as  fresh  evidence,  and
    recorded the respondent's request for an adjournment.  She  ought  next
    to have considered whether to grant the adjournment: if she refused it,
    she was obliged to decide on the evidence whether any of the  statutory
    grounds of appeal were established; if she granted it, she should  have
    set directions with a view to  the  case  being  listed  for  effective
    disposal.  The absence of a decision either way was an  error  of  law.
    It was a further error  to  direct  the  respondent  to  make  a  fresh
    decision, a matter not within the tribunal's jurisdiction.

 6. With the agreement of both parties, the decision  of  the  FtT  is  set
    aside, and further directions made as follows.

 7. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 8. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Beg.

 9. The relevant decision-maker of the respondent has still to consider the
    evidence.  Accordingly, the respondent is directed to file with the FtT
    and copy to the appellant by 5 September 2017  a  supplementary  letter
    explaining the effect the fresh evidence is considered to have  on  the
    decision.

10. The appellant will also require time to consider matters  in  light  of
    that response, so the case will be listed in the FtT for hearing on  or
    after 1 November 2017 - preferably soon after that date, but given  the
    circumstances and history of this case the  FtT  will  no  doubt  treat
    sensitively any request by either side for further adjournment.

11. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
