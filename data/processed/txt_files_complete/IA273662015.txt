Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings. I do so in order to avoid  a  likelihood
    of serious harm arising to the appellant from  the  disclosure  of  his
    medical condition.

 2. This is an appeal against a decision dated 26 September 2016 of  First-
    tier Tribunal Beg which refused the Article 8 ECHR medical claim of the
    appellant.

 3. GS is a national of India, born in 1985. He came to the UK in 2009 with
    leave as a student. He was granted further leave to remain  on  medical
    grounds from 12 June 2013 to  31  January  2015.  His  application  for
    further leave on medical grounds  was  refused  and  he  appealed,  the
    appeal being heard before Judge Beg on 14 September 2016.

 4. There is no dispute as to the key facts. Very sadly, GS has  a  serious
    and rare illness, metastatic paraganglioma or  neuro-endocrine  cancer.
    His Consultant at University College Hospital  indicated  in  a  letter
    dated 4 July 2016 that the appellant's  condition  was  "incurable  but
    that treatments from time to time as required could control the disease
    and delay its progress for long periods of time". The  Consultant  also
    indicated that the illness "requires very specialist multi-disciplinary
    care" which "will not be available" in India  and  expressed  the  view
    that where the appellant would not be able  to  pay  for  treatment  in
    India, "his life expectancy would be significantly shortened".

 5. Before the First-tier Tribunal it was conceded that the Article 3  ECHR
    medical claim was not made out; see [10]. That concession was  made  as
    the case law at that time indicated that "Article 3 medical  cases  are
    limited to deathbed cases".

 6. The Article 8 ECHR medical claim was  argued  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant's private  life  amounted  to  the  "separate  or  additional
    factual element" required for an Article 8 medical case to succeed; see
    [86] of GS (India) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 40.

 7. After conducting a proportionality assessment, Judge Beg did  not  find
    that the Article 8  claim  was  made  out.  She  noted  that  case  law
    indicated that the absence of inadequacy of medical treatment in  India
    alone could not make out a breach of Article 8; see [19] and [24].  She
    found that the evidence did not indicate an  absence  of  treatment  in
    India in any event and that his family there could offer  support;  see
    [27]. She found that the appellant  could  seek  employment  in  India,
    could access some treatment, would have family support and knew of  his
    condition before coming to the UK; see [37].

 8. The grounds for permission to appeal the decision of Judge Beg made  to
    the First-tier Tribunal argued that  an  error  of  law  arose  as  the
    appellant would not be able to access treatment in India  as  he  could
    not pay for it. The grounds also maintained that  the  judge  erred  in
    finding that the appellant had known of his condition before coming  to
    the UK and weighing that against him in the proportionality assessment.
    Permission was refused in a decision dated 8 May 2017, issued on 9  May
    2017.

 9. By the time that the appellant renewed the application  for  permission
    to appeal in the Upper Tribunal, the European  Court  of  Human  Rights
    (ECtHR) had decided the case of Paposhvili  v  Belgium  (41738/10).  In
    that case the Grand Chamber set  out  a  restatement  of  the  test  in
    Article 3 medical cases. At [183] for example:


         "183.  The Court considers that the "other very exceptional cases"
         within the meaning of the judgment in N. v. the United Kingdom (ï¿½
         43) which may raise an issue under Article 3 should be understood
         to refer to situations involving the removal of a seriously ill
         person in which substantial grounds have been shown for believing
         that he or she, although not at imminent risk of dying, would face
         a real risk, on account of the absence of appropriate treatment in
         the receiving country or the lack of access to such treatment, of
         being exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his
         or her state of health resulting in intense suffering or to a
         significant reduction in life expectancy. The Court points out that
         these situations correspond to a high threshold for the application
         of Article 3 of the Convention in cases concerning the removal of
         aliens suffering from serious illness."

10. In the grounds of appeal lodged on 19 May 2017, the appellant sought to
    rely on Paposhvili, arguing that it altered materially the approach the
    judge should have taken to the availability of treatment in  India  and
    to wider issues such as family support and ability to work.

11. I granted permission on all grounds in a decision dated 12  July  2017,
    issued on 20 July 2017, noting the Paposhvili point in particular.

12. By the time of the hearing on 13 November 2017, thinking on the correct
    application of Paposhvili had progressed somewhat. Mr Lemer provided  a
    preliminary note dated 12 November 2017. It  was  conceded  that  legal
    precedent meant that Paposhvili could not be applied by the  First-tier
    Tribunal or Upper Tribunal in the manner sought by the  appellant.  The
    Tribunal remained bound by the  superior  domestic  authorities  of  GS
    (India), D v United Kingdom [1997] ECHR 30240/96 and N v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2005] UKHL 31.  Where that was  so,  the
    appellant applied for a certificate under s.14A of the Tribunals Courts
    and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007), that is permission  to  "leapfrog"
    the appeal to the Supreme Court.

13. I declined to make a certificate under s.14A of the TCE 2007. The power
    is discretionary. In my judgement, the points the appellant  wished  to
    argue were appropriate for consideration by the Court of  Appeal.  That
    is particularly so in this case which is an Article 8 ECHR claim  only,
    Paposhvili addressing medical cases within the context  of  Articles  2
    and 3.

14. I noted that in the event of a s.14A  certificate  being  granted,  the
    appellant also sought to apply to vary his grounds of appeal so  as  to
    include a challenge on Article 3  ECHR  grounds.  For  completeness,  I
    should indicate that I refuse any application to amend the  grounds  to
    include Article 3 ECHR. The point was abandoned before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The application to amend and re-instate an Article  3  appeal
    was not made in any of the grounds of appeal and was raised only on the
    day of the error of law hearing before me. It  is  not  appropriate  to
    reintroduce  a  substantive  head  of  claim  at  this  stage  of   the
    proceedings. It is open to the appellant to make a fresh claim based on
    Paposhvilli if he wishes.

15. In conclusion, without the application of Paposhvili,  the  grounds  do
    not show that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law.  The  conclusions
    that some treatment is available in India and that the appellant  would
    have  family  support  there  and  could  work  are  not  shown  to  be
    irrational. The First-tier Tribunal was also entitled to conclude  that
    the appellant's private  life  in  the  UK  consisted  of  a  group  of
    supportive friends and the medical treatment  the  appellant  has  been
    receiving and that where that private life was always  precarious,  the
    decision was not disproportionate. The  appellant's  knowledge  of  his
    illness before he came to the UK is not shown  to  be  a  determinative
    factor in the appeal.

DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an error on
a point of law and shall stand.
