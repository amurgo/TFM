               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Maguire,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent refused the appellant's claim on all  available  grounds
    for reasons explained in her letter dated 26 May 2017.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge A M S Green dismissed the appellant's  appeal
    for reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 27 July 2017.

 3. The appellant's grounds of appeal are set out in  the  application  for
    permission filed with the UT on 4 September 2017, and are headed:

    (1) errors of law in relation to section 8;

    (2) errors of law in  relation  to  the  assessment  of  the  screening
    interview;

    (3) errors of law in terms of the appellant's documentation; and

    (4) errors of law when assessing the best interests of the child.

 4. Further to ground (1), Mr Winter  submitted  that  although  the  judge
    directed himself correctly, based on SM [2005] UKIAT 0116, that section
    8 was not the starting point, in  fact  he  fell  into  precisely  that
    error.

 5. As Mr Govan observed, to address section 8 first is  not  the  same  as
    treating it as creating an overall presumption, or as decisive  on  its
    own.

 6. There is no reason to think that the judge  did  not  observe  his  own
    direction, or that he took matters related to section 8 out of context,
    rather than reaching his decision in the round.  I  find  no  error  in
    terms of ground (1).

 7. Ground (2) says that  the  "natural  and  unrestrained  interpretation"
    which the judge gave the passage from the screening interview quoted at
    �15 is "not supported where the evidence supports the appellant being a
    police officer".

 8. At first sight, the passage quoted can readily be  interpreted  as  the
    judge says.

 9. The ground gained some force when Mr Winter referred to passages in the
    screening interview (at 1.14 and 5.1), shortly before and shortly after
    the passage quoted, where the appellant clearly  says  that  he  was  a
    police officer.

10. Mr Govan argued that the judge's point is a broader one, based  on  the
    appellant not mentioning (a) being targeted  by  ISIS  or  (b)  working
    undercover as a police officer, at a stage  when  those  matters  might
    have been expected to emerge.

11. As the context broadens, and reading the whole of �16, where the  judge
    analyses the matter, and bears in mind the caution to be  exercised  in
    relation to a screening interview, I find this ground  to  disclose  no
    error.

12. Ground (3) is developed  under  sub-headings  (i)  -  (v),  but  mainly
    depends on the previous grounds as a starting point for  error  in  the
    judge  declining  to  accept  that  the  appellant  has   no   identity
    documentation.

13. As the reasons for finding the appellant generally no credible are  not
    undermined, there is  no  starting  point  for  finding  error  in  the
    conclusions about availability of documentation, or about the viability
    of relocation to Baghdad.

14. The appellant did not advance  in  the  FtT  any  substantial  case  of
    difficulty in relocating there.  Mr Winter submitted that  there  might
    be an obvious error of failing  to  apply  country  guidance,  but  the
    judge's conclusions offered no basis for any other outcome by reference
    to BA.

15. Relocation to the KRG was an alternative issue.

16. There is no force in the point at sub-heading (iv) that the  respondent
    had to prove the appellant's wife  had  been  "pre-cleared"  to  return
    there; cf. Khedr v SSHD [2017] CSIH 66.

17. The case is somewhat out of the usual in that the appellant says he  is
    Arab, and has withdrawn his statement that he  speaks  Kurdish  Sorani,
    while his wife is Kurdish; but generally, it is for  him  to  establish
    the primary facts, and he has failed to do  so.   It  is  not  for  the
    respondent or the tribunal to divine matters which have been concealed.
    Inability to work out in advance the practical details of return is not
    a basis for protection.

18. Ground (4) complains that the judge made no  assessment  of  background
    factors relevant to the best interests of the child.  Mr  Winter  added
    that the general matters raised by BA were relevant also here.

19. The best interests of the child are obviously served by remaining  with
    both parents.  In the FtT, the appellant developed no substantial  case
    that the child's best interests  would  be  significantly  affected  by
    return as a member of an ordinary Iraqi family unit.  This ground shows
    no error in the judge's analysis at �22 - 24 of the decision.

20.  Sub-heading (iii) of this ground, based on the alleged  difficulty  of
    the appellant relocating to the KRG along  with  his  wife  and  child,
    fails for the same reasons as ground (3).

21. Separately and together, the grounds are not in substance more than  an
    attempt to re-argue and add to the case.  They do  not  show  that  the
    making of the decision of the FtT involved the making of any error on a
    point of law, such that it ought to be set aside.

22. The decision of the FtT shall stand.

23. The FtT made an anonymity direction.  The matter was not  addressed  in
    the UT.  Anonymity has been maintained herein.
