Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr L Fransman Q.C and Mr A Vaughan, Counsel
                    instructed by Gherson & Co


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   We shall refer to the  parties  as  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
    Appellant is a citizen of Ukraine born on 19th April 1984. Her  appeal,
    against the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  dated  18th  March  2014
    refusing to vary leave to remain and to remove her  from  the  UK,  was
    allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Robinson, in a decision dated 27th
    November 2014, under paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.

2.   The Judge found that  the  Appellant  had  shown,  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities, that she had at least 10 years continuous  residence  in
    the UK and that she had not spent a total of more than 18 months absent
    from the UK during the relevant period.

3.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Cruthers
    on the grounds that it was arguable  the  Judge  failed  to  take  into
    account a break in the Appellant's lawful  residence  from  16th  March
    2004 to 22nd June 2004.

4.   At the hearing, Ms  Holmes  conceded  that  the  point  raised  in  the
    grounds, and upon which permission  was  granted,  was  incorrect.  The
    Appellant had a visa valid until 20th June 2004. She conceded that  the
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal should be dismissed. It was agreed by  the
    parties that there was no error of law in the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

5.   Notwithstanding, the Respondent's concession, the  Appellant  satisfied
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules because,  as  at  the  date  of
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal on 17th November 2014,  she  had
    10 years continuous lawful residence.  The  period  relied  on  in  the
    Respondent's grounds of appeal was  outside  the  relevant  period  and
    therefore immaterial to the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  decision  to
    allow the appeal.

6.   Accordingly, we find that there was no error of law in the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal and the Respondent's appeal is  dismissed.  The
    decision dated 27th November 2014 shall stand.


Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
