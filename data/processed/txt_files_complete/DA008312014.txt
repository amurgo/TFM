For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a national of the Democratic Republic of Congo  (DRC),
    who was born on 3rd March, 1960.

2.   On 6th May, 2014 the respondent refused to revoke a  deportation  order
    earlier made  against  the  appellant  on  28th  November,  2005.   The
    appellant appealed that decision to the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  his
    appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow sitting at  Taylor
    House on 24th November, 2014.

Immigration history

3.   The appellant's immigration history is uncontested.

    (a)  He first arrived in the United Kingdom using  the  name  Kaimgombe
         Yagi on 22nd July, 1990.  Thereafter, on a date which has not  been
         disclosed, he left the United Kingdom, subsequently  to  return  on
         24th March, 1991.  On 12th  April,   1991,  the  appellant  claimed
         asylum in the name of Yagi Kaimgombe stating that his date of birth
         was 15th June, 1959.  Five days later,  on  17th  April,  1991  the
         appellant made another claim for asylum in the same name, but  gave
         his date of birth as  3rd  March,  1960.   The  latter  application
         lapsed because the appellant apparently  left  the  United  Kingdom
         again during 1991. On 22nd July 1992 the appellant was served  with
         illegal entry papers and on 18th August, 1992  his  initial  asylum
         application was refused on non-compliance grounds.


    (b)  On 30th January, 1993, the appellant was  detected  departing  the
         United Kingdom for Belgium using a French passport in the  name  of
         another person.  It is assumed that the appellant  must  have  left
         the United Kingdom, because he was subsequently encountered on 22nd
         July, 1993 attempting to  re-enter  the  United  Kingdom,  using  a
         forged French passport. Thereafter, he was refused leave  to  enter
         and returned to Belgium.  It is believed that  he  must  have  been
         returned by the Belgian authorities to the United Kingdom  because,
         on 20th October, 1997  the  appellant  was  convicted  at  Haringey
         Magistrates' Court of two  counts  of  handling  stolen  goods  and
         sentenced to a fine of ï¿½50 on each count. At Manchester Crown Court
         on 22nd September, 1999 the appellant was convicted of  two  counts
         of obtaining property by deception  and  sentenced  to  two  years'
         imprisonment.


    (c)  It is assumed that the appellant must have again left  the  United
         Kingdom because  on  9th  June,  2002,  he  was  again  encountered
         attempting to re-enter  the  United  Kingdom  using  a  counterfeit
         Belgian 1951 United Nations travel document in the name of  another
         person.  On 11th June, 2002, the appellant  again  claimed  asylum.
         Subsequently, having been refused, he lodged an  appeal,  but  this
         was abandoned on 28th January, 2003.  Thereafter the appellant  was
         refused permission to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.


    (d)  On 12th May, 2003, the appellant was  convicted  at  Bolton  Crown
         Court  of  conspiracy  to  defraud  and  sentenced  to  six   years
         imprisonment on 24th October, 2003. A recommendation  was  made  by
         the judge that he be deported. The respondent issued a  deportation
         order which was the subject of an appeal  which  was  dismissed  on
         20th October, 2005. An application for review was  refused  on  3rd
         September, 2005.  Thereafter, between 2006 and 2007, the  appellant
         made further representations which were refused  for  want  of  new
         evidence to consider as a fresh claim.


    (e)  On 30th October, 2007, the appellant was convicted  of  fraud  and
         sentenced by Glasgow Sherriff's Court to two  years'  imprisonment.
         Thereafter further representations were made to  the  Secretary  of
         State and on 14th February, 2011 the appellant made a further claim
         for asylum.


    (f)  On 21st February, 2011, the appellant was convicted at  Birmingham
         Crown Court of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced to
         an effective period of imprisonment of 38  months.   The  appellant
         was subsequently  released  on  licence  on  13th  December,  2011,
         subject  to  licence  conditions.   Between  2011  and  2013,   the
         appellant and respondent  exchanged  correspondence  until  on  9th
         April, 2013, the  respondent  refused  to  revoke  the  appellant's
         deportation order made  on  28th  November,  2005,  and  which  the
         appellant appealed.  The appeal was dismissed by Immigration  Judge
         Afako on  15th  October,  2013  (DA/00761/2013).   His  appeal  was
         dismissed on asylum grounds, on human rights grounds and on grounds
         funded under the European Economic Area Regulations.


         (i)  Briefly, the appellant's asylum claim was based on his claimed
             membership of APERECO (UK), an  organisation  opposed  to  the
             rule of President Kabila in the DRC.  The appellant claimed to
             have organised protest marches  against  President  Kabila  in
             London and claimed that he would be of adverse interest to the
             authorities in the DRC should  he  be  returned  to  his  home
             country.  In dismissing the appellant's appeal,  the  Tribunal
             was not satisfied that the appellant was a member  of  APERECO
             (UK)  or  that   he   organised   or   participated   in   any
             demonstrations.  It  concluded,  relying  on  current  country
             guidance, that the appellant would not be at any risk of  ill-
             treatment or persecution on his return to the DRC.


         (ii) Despite  the  appellant's  claimed  family  relationships  and
             lengths of times spent in the United Kingdom, his conduct  and
             propensity to reoffend were considered by  the  respondent  to
             constitute a serious threat to society.  The  judge  concluded
             that the Secretary of State's  conclusion  was  in  accordance
             with the law and constituted a proportional  response  to  the
             appellant's conduct and circumstances.


         (iii)    On 9th December, 2013 permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
             Tribunal was refused.


    (g)  In letters dated 18 December, 2013, 30th January  and  4th  March,
         2014,  the  appellant  made  further  submissions  relying  on  the
         provisions of paragraph 343 of Statement of Changes in  Immigration
         Rules, HC 395 (as amended) ("the Immigration Rules") as to a  well-
         founded fear of persecution should he be returned to the DRC,  that
         his situation ought to be considered due to the  findings  made  in
         the case of R (on the application of P (DRC); R (on the application
         of R (DRC) [2013] EWHC 3879  (Admin);  and  that  he  suffers  from
         depression and is at risk of suicide should he be returned  to  his
         home country.

The Basis for The Appellant's Claim to Asylum

4.   Before Judge Callow, it was the appellant's claim  that  subsequent  to
    his release from prison he continued to attend APERECO  (UK)  meetings,
    but that he was now no longer a member.  Instead,  he  had  joined  the
    Congolese Support Group ("CSG") which was also opposed  to  the  Kabila
    regime in power in the DRC.  Subsequent to  the  refusal  of  6th  May,
    2014, the appellant attended a demonstration outside  the  DRC  Embassy
    and number 10 Downing Street protesting against the Kabila  regime  and
    imploring the  government  not  to  deport  Congolese  asylum  seekers.
    Photographs of the demonstration, including  those  of  the  appellant,
    had, apparently, been posted on the Congolese Support Group website.  A
    medical report from Colindale Medical Centre  dated  14th  March,  2003
    prepared by Dr Lamba asserted that the appellant  suffers  from  raised
    blood pressure and anxiety with depression. It records the  details  of
    prescribed for the appellant.  In her report of 1st December, 2013,  Dr
    Georgina Costa, a psychologist advised that the appellant suffers  from
    depression.

5.   Judge Callow made adverse findings of credibility  and  concluded  that
    the appellant was a low level member of  the  Congolese  Support  Group
    with no political profile in his home country. The judge found that  he
    would not be at risk on return. The appellant's asylum  and  Article  3
    claims were dismissed.  The judge concluded  that  there  had  been  no
    material change of circumstances such that the deportation  order  made
    on 28 November 2005 must be  revoked.   The  appellant  challenged  the
    determination of Judge Callow and permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Simpson  on  2nd
    September, 2015.

6.   At a hearing before Upper Tribunal  Judge  O'Connor  on  7th  December,
    2015, he found that Judge Callow had erred in law and ordered that  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal be set aside.  The hearing was
    adjourned in  order  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  should  undertake  the
    remaking of the decision. A copy of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  O'Connor's
    Decision and Reasons are set in the appendix to this determination.

7.   Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor concluded that the  findings  of  primary
    fact made by the First-tier Tribunal are to remain standing.

8.   At the hearing before me Mr Bartram told  me  that  the  basis  of  the
    appellant's asylum and Article 3  claim  is  that  he  has  now  joined
    APERECO (UK) and is now no longer a member of the Congo Support  Group.
    He claims that he is  still  at  risk  as  a  result  of  his  previous
    activities on behalf of Congo Support Group.

9.   Mr Bartram told me that he would be adducing any  evidence  in  respect
    of the appellant's previous  activities  on  behalf  of  Congo  Support
    Group.

10.  He  also  told  me  that  no  evidence  would  be  adduced  as  to  the
    appellant's Article 8 private and family life claim and that Mr Bartram
    would not be making  any  submissions  on  it.   He  told  me  that  an
    anonymity order earlier made  was  no  longer  required  and  could  be
    discharged.

11.  Mr Bartram confirmed that the appellant's immigration history  was  not
    contested and told me that the only issue in respect of the appellant's
    asylum claim was his sur place activities in the United Kingdom.

Appellant's oral testimony

Evidence in Chief

12.  I then heard evidence from the appellant who told me that his  forename
    and his last name had been interchanged and, instead  of  being  Yagien
    Wawe, he should be Wawe Yagien.  He  confirmed  his  address,  date  of
    birth and nationality.

13.  The appellant said that he last entered the  United  Kingdom  in  1991.
    During his time in the United Kingdom he  has  been  a  member  of  two
    organisations.  From the beginning  of  2007  he  became  a  member  of
    APERECO (UK) which he described as being "an alliance of  patriots  who
    wished to reform the Congo".  When asked what his role  was  he  simply
    replied, "I was in charge of mobilisation".  He said that  in  2014  he
    joined a group called Congo Support Group.   When  he  was  asked  what
    Congo Support Group was he replied, "According to the group,  they  are
    talking about the situation in the country; the  problems  that  people
    are facing in my country and in the UK".  He went on to say  that  they
    discussed political difficulties in the DRC with  Congolese  people  in
    the United Kingdom and if anyone has any problems in  terms  of  asylum
    they can seek help from the group. That is why they called  it,  "Congo
    Support Group".

14.  The appellant said that he wanted to show his involvement in  terms  of
    fighting injustice which was happening in the DRC and that  is  why  he
    joined Congo Support Group.  The appellant told me,

         "As the leader of Congo Support Group saw my good intention to help
         get others involved, I became involved in encouraging other  people
         to come together to fight for democracy and then they chose  me  to
         go for leadership training".

15.  The appellant was asked by his solicitor if he could describe his  role
     within CSG.  He replied:

         "To make other people aware of the lack of democracy  or  injustice
         happening in Congo.  The worst  problems  that  we  are  facing  in
         Congo. That is why although we  live  outside  the  country  it  is
         important to know how the country is run and what are the problems.
          Because so many people do not watch the news,  so  many  Congolese
         people are not informed and are not reading enough.  In our culture
         sometimes people tend  to  forget  about  the  situation  in  their
         country because they are living here as foreigners."
He H

16.  Mr Bartram then asked the appellant if he could describe  the  role  of
    Congo Support Group.  He said,

         "One of our aims was to fight against wrongdoing in the country. In
         my country everything in  terms  of  running  the  country  is  not
         working.  They are mobilising other people to  tell  them  what  is
         happening so that they can put pressure on the government in  DRC".



17.  I explained that I was having  some  difficulty  in  understanding  the
    role of Congo Support Group and his role within it and he told me,  "UK
    invest a lot of money in DRC to  support  the  population  but  in  the
    population they are not benefiting from the investment."  He went on,

         "My country has  a  lot  of  resources  like  diamonds,  gold,  and
         uranium.  People are not able to exploit these resources themselves
         which is why  western  countries  have  been  trying  to  help  the
         government.  The British government  send  money   to  support  the
         police and protect the country."

18.  I explained to the appellant  that  I  still  had  some  difficulty  in
    understanding what it was  that  he  actually  did  on  behalf  of  the
    organisation, to which he replied,

         "I was mobilising Congolese people in the UK.  I did it by going to
         meet  people  in  hair   salons,   Congolese   shops,   cafï¿½s   and
         restaurants."

19.  In answer to further questions put by his solicitor he  explained  that
    it was difficult to get Congolese people together because of their work
    commitments  and  so  Congo  Support  Group  also  tried  to   organise
    demonstrations to show the United Kingdom and other  governments,  "the
    wrong management within the DRC government".

20.  The Congo Support Group organised and planned a  demonstration  outside
    the Congolese Embassy and also went to  number  10  Downing  Street  to
    present a memorandum to explain why Congo Support  Group  were  putting
    pressure on the government of Congo.  This took place in June 2014 and,
    the appellant insisted, he attended.  I was referred to page 58 of  the
    appellant's bundle which contained two photographs which appeared to me
    to have  been  taken  outside  the  Ministry  of  Defence  building  in
    Whitehall. The appellant told me that he was in both pictures and  that
    the demonstration had taken  place  outside  the  Ministry  of  Defence
    building  in  Whitehall,  because  the  police  would  not  allow   the
    demonstrators to go into Downing Street.  The appellant appeared to  be
    standing behind a banner, the top line of which said, "Congolese Oppose
    UK Policy". The rest of the banner was not  visible.  The  second  line
    called for Kabila to step down and the bottom line said, "UK must stop"
    but the rest of what was written was not visible. I was  then  referred
    to two photographs on page 60, and he said that one of them showed  him
    with leaders of the Congo Support Group.

21.  The appellant told me that he was no  longer  a  member  of  the  Congo
    Support Group, because sometimes he understood that,

         "they became more involved in politics than in putting pressure  on
    the government."

22.  I asked the appellant if he could explain what he meant.  He said  that
    Congo Support Group wanted to have a role in the government in DRC  and
    during the meetings they started to discuss the elections, but  in  the
    meantime the country is under occupation. He told me that he  left  the
    CSG at the end of 2015. He later corrected this and  told  me  that  he
    ceased his activities in December 2014.

23.  I indicated to Mr Bartram that I had experienced  great  difficulty  in
    understanding the appellant's role or the work of Congo Support  Group.



24.  Mr Bartram endeavoured to clarify  the  evidence  with  the  appellant.
    The appellant said that when he stopped going to Congo Support Group he
    decided to go back to APERECO (UK), "where I started".  He told me,

         "They inform people that the country  is  still  under  occupation.
         There is no point in trying to organise the elections."

    In answer to further questions from Mr Bartram the appellant said,

         "When I joined, my role was to counsel other Congolese  in  the  UK
         and then in April 2015 I was chosen.   I  joined  APERECO  (UK)  in
         April 2015.  I was then chosen to be one of the advisors to prepare
         forthcoming meetings.  In October 2015 I was promoted as  whole  UK
         advisor in APERECO (UK) in terms of mobilisation and strategy."

25.  The appellant added, "We are a group of resistance." He was asked  what
    the group's strategies were and he said, "Being in a  resistance  group
    our strategies are confidential." He was  asked  to  explain  what  the
    strategies were that he claimed his role was involved  with  strategies
    and replied,

         "We want people who are mistreating our population  to  be  removed
         from the government because they are not of Congolese  origin.  One
         important strategy is  to  show   and  to  convince  the  Congolese
         population based on evidence that we have that our country is still
         under occupation.  Our strategies are not long.  It is to  let  the
         people to get ready to remove the current  government  and  not  to
         accept a foreigner to run the country.  The  authorities  in  Congo
         don't like our group because the message that we are telling people
         about  the  country  cannot  be  under  occupation   and   run   by
         foreigners."

26.  The appellant was then referred to page 26 of the bundle and said  that
    this also showed him in both photographs attending a committee  meeting
    in London.  The photographs on  pages  12  and  13  also  show  him  at
    meetings with the new United Kingdom Labour Party leader.

27.  The document which starts at page 33 - 36 was a copy of a  presentation
    on a TV channel called "BEN".   The said that  he  was  interviewed  on
    behalf of the TV channel which subsequently broadcast the interview.

28.  At page 28 of the appellant's bundle is a photograph  of  APERECO  (UK)
    demonstrators in a report.  The report was written in French,  but  one
    line of the banner in the  photograph  said  "Say  'No'  for  Kikay  as
    ambassador in the UK" and "'No' for any deportation of Congolese to the
    DRC Congo."   The appellant told me that he and others were  protesting
    because the DRC government wanted to return the  former  ambassador  to
    the United Kingdom and the group did not want him back  in  the  United
    Kingdom, because he is a government supporter.

29.  The appellant was referred to page 7 of the bundle  and  he  said  that
    there  appeared  photocopies  of  his  APERECO  (UK)  business   cards,
    describing him as "Territory counsellor".  He told me that he gave them
    to Congolese people when he goes  to  shops,  salons,  restaurants  and
    cafes.

30.  The appellant told me  that  he  had  been  appointed  as  a  territory
    counsellor, because he is an old member of APERECO (UK) and they looked
    at his involvement and saw that he was a patriot.  He said  that  as  a
    patriot he is someone who is always ready for his country.  He told  me
    that when he hands out his cards he speaks to people and asks them  not
    to support the government in place in Congo and to  tell  their  family
    members back in Congo not to support the government  and  not  to  take
    part in the elections, because the country is still under occupation.

31.  The  appellant  explained  that  APERECO  (UK)  does  not  support  the
    government and that is why they encourage the population  not  to  take
    part in the elections and would like to see the national  president  of
    APERECO (UK) as President of the Congo.  The appellant told me  he  did
    not know where  the  national  president  was.   The  words  "territory
    counsellor" means that he is a counsellor for the whole of  the  United
    Kingdom, but mainly for London and Wales.

Cross examination

32.  Cross-examined by the Presenting Officer on behalf of  the  respondent,
    the appellant todl me that the president of APERECO (UK) in the  United
    Kingdom is Mr Ernest Likiyo.  He chairs the group in the United Kingdom
    and is in charge of other areas.  The appellant explained that  APERECO
    (UK) had territory counsellors in Yorkshire,  West  Midlands,  Glasgow,
    London, Manchester and that there are seven in total. He reports direct
    to Mr Ernest Likiyo.  He was asked by Mr Whitwell the aims  of  APERECO
    (UK) and replied, "We are fighting for a country under occupation". The
    appellant was then referred to page 24 of the bundle which was a letter
    from Mr Ernest Likiyo dated 20 April  2015  written  on  "APERECO  (UK)
    Youth" notepaper. He told me that the president was  the  president  of
    the  Youth  wing  and  had  been  using  the  same  headed   notepaper.
    Originally the appellant joined APERECO (UK) in  April  2014.   He  was
    then referred to  what  had  been  recorded  by  Judge  Callow  in  his
    determination where he said that  it  was  the  appellant's  case  that
    subsequent to  his release  from  prison  the  appellant  continued  to
    attend APERECO (UK) meetings, but that he was now no longer  a  member.
    The appellant then said that he had never left completely and that  his
    activities started with his membership of APERECO (UK) in 2007.  He had
    always been in favour of its aims and denied the suggestion made to him
    that he had, "Jumped from one group to another".

Questions put by me in order to clarify the appellant's evidence.

33.  I explained  that  I  had  difficulty  in  understanding  some  of  the
    appellant's evidence and asked if he could clarify several  points  for
    me.  He told me that he originally joined APERECO (UK) in 2007 but left
    APERECO (UK) for a short while in 2014.  I referred him to a photograph
    at page 9 of the bundle where one of the demonstrators was shown  in  a
    photograph  holding  up  a  placard  saying  "Labour  Party  must  stop
    supporting Kagane and atrocities in the DRC".   I  asked  if  he  could
    explain.  He said that APERECO (UK) members went to  Chatham  House  to
    present an APERECO (UK) memo because Kagane came to the United Kingdom.
     The demonstration was to tell the UK government  not  to  welcome  the
    current member of the DRC government. He confirmed that  the  reference
    to "Labour Party" was a reference to the United Kingdom Labour Party.

34.  APERECO (UK) does have posters and leaflets, but they are produced  for
    specific events, he told me.

35.  The appellant explained  that  he  had  left  Congo  Support  Group  in
    December 2014, because most of the time they were telling people to  go
    to the elections and were encouraging people to vote.  In his  opinion,
    he could not support a group where people were ignoring the  fact  that
    the country was being occupied.

Oral evidence of Mr Ernest Likiyo

Evidence in chief

36.  The witness confirmed his name, date of birth, address and that he  was
    a British subject. He confirmed also that he wrote letters at pages  15
    and 24 of the appellant's bundle in  support  of  the  appellant.   The
    witness said that he was president of APERECO (UK) United  Kingdom  and
    that the appellant had been appointed a member in 2015 and was promoted
    in October that year.  This was based on  his  demonstrated  commitment
    and the way he showed that he was what the group needed.  His  role  is
    to advise the Congolese people about  resistance.   APERECO  (UK)  does
    everything it can to help Congo have  freedom.   The  witness  told  me
    that,

         "We tell people what is going on back home and about atrocities and
         about the occupations.  I find out from relatives of mine and  from
         the  media.  Most  Congolese  people  here  can't  read.   We  make
         petitions and take part in demonstrations. I am a leader  and  have
         two vice presidents, a treasurer and a secretary.   They  lead  the
         whole of the United Kingdom."

37.  The witness confirmed that the appellant  was  a  'territory  advisor'.
    He said that there were seventeen members who are the leaders  and  who
    hold office with him and that five  others  do  the  same  job  as  the
    appellant as 'territory advisors'.  He confirmed that the appellant was
    based in London.  The national president and vice  national  presidents
    and the general secretary of APERECO are above the witness in terms  of
    organisation, but the witness is  president  of  APERECO  (UK)  in  the
    United Kingdom.

38.  The witness told me that the appellant was well  known  within  APERECO
    (UK).  He invites people to meetings and tells theme about APERECO (UK)
    and amongst the Congolese population in the United Kingdom he is  known
    as an APERECO (UK) member.

Cross examination

39.   Cross-examined  by  Mr  Whitwell,  the  witness  confirmed  that   the
    appellant had been  a member  of  APERECO  (UK)  UK  since  2007.   The
    witness said he had known him since then. He was then shown page 24  of
    the  bundle  which  appeared  to  have  been   written  on  Youth  Wing
    notepaper.  He explained that he had been promoted from the  leader  of
    the Youth Wing in July 2015 and the appellant was  appointed  territory
    counsellor  in  October  2015.   He  was  asked  how   many   territory
    counsellors there were and he  said  that  there  were  five.   It  was
    pointed out to him that the appellant had said that there were seven.

40.  The witness then said  that  there  were  other  people  who  had  been
    previously appointed territory counsellors.  He said that there may  be
    three or four of them. They remain members of APERECO (UK) as far as he
    is concerned and he considers them to be members although they  are  no
    longer members.

41.  I did not believe that the  witness  was  telling  me  the  truth.   He
    appeared to be making up his evidence as he gave it.

42.  When asked about APERECO (UK) the witness  said,  "We  don't  look  for
    power.  The appellant helps me with resistance.   Congo  Support  Group
    used to do their work as we do but then their president  went  home  to
    become involved with the elections."

Questions put by me in order to clarify the witness's evidence.

43.  I asked the witness if he could clarify part of his evidence for me.  I
    referred him to  his letter of 20th April, 2015  and  page  24  of  the
    bundle and to the last paragraph which said:-

         "I can certify that several of our supporters and members who  have
         been  deported to the DRC are all tortured and killed; that is  why
         I believe that [WY] will be in danger of death."

44.  I asked the witness if he had given details of the members of  AMPERECO
    (UK) who had been retuned from the United Kingdom to the DRC  and  been
    tortured and killed on return, to the Home Office.  He told me that  he
    had not and said that this was because he had previously written to the
    Home Office who do not reply to  his letters. He claimed to  have  sent
    details to the Commissioner for the Metropolitan Police.

45.  In answer to further questions put to him by  Mr  Bartram  the  witness
    told me that the appellant's role is to look out into the community.

Submissions

46.  Mr Whitwell told me that he relied on the Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter
    and reminded me that pages 8 to 13 and 25 to 27  were  written  in  the
    French language.   He asked  me  to  ignore  them.   According  to  the
    uncontested  immigration  history  the  appellant   appears   to   have
    unlawfully entered the United Kingdom on at least three occasions.   He
    had an immigration appeal before Immigration Judge Beg in 2005 but  did
    not raise any  political  concerns  at  that  stage.   He  has  several
    convictions for offences involving deceits and, Mr Whitwell  submitted,
    has attempted to practice deception today.  He claimed to have remained
    an APERECO (UK) member whilst also belonging to the Congo Support Group
    until it was pointed out to him that he had previously told  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Callow in November 2014 that he was no longer  a  member
    of APERECO (UK).  Today giving evidence he claimed that he was  one  of
    seven advisors but giving evidence the national president  contradicted
    the appellant.

47.  So far as country guidance is concerned, BM  and  Others  (Returnees  -
    criminal and non-criminal) DRC CG [2015] UKUT 00293 (IAC) at  paragraph
    88 summarises the guidance given by the Presidential panel of the Upper
    Tribunal.  In respect  of  DRC  nationals  returning  from  the  United
    Kingdom he reminded me that only those who  have,  "a  significant  and
    visible profile within APARECO UK" are at real risk of persecution  and
    on the evidence we have heard today the appellant does  not  belong  to
    and  could  not  be  perceived  to  be  a  leader,  office  bearer   or
    spokesperson and he invited me to dismiss the appeal.

48.  Finally, he drew my  attention  to  the  transcript  of  the  broadcast
    during which the appellant had been  interviewed and asked me  to  note
    that the appellant says very little more about  his role. He was not  a
    board member and would not be at any risk on return.

49.  Finally, Mr Whitwell reminded me that this was the  only  ground  being
    pursued by the appellant.

50.  Mr Bartram told me that he would be brief.  He implored  me  to  follow
    the country guidance case of BM  and  Others  and  suggested  that  the
    appellant was an office holder of APERECO (UK). He reminded me that the
    appellant had appeared in a TV programme broadcast in Africa on Ben  TV
    and offers advice to the leadership  of  APERECO  (UK)  in  the  United
    Kingdom. He suggested that the appeal should be allowed.

Consideration of the Appellant's Claim - Scope of the Claim

51.  This appeal is quite exceptional in that during  the  appellant's  time
    in the United Kingdom he has made various claims, most  of  which  have
    not been pursued in the appeal before me:
             (a)   I received no medical evidence in relation to the  claim
                  which he made in his 2005 appeal, mainly that he had  HIV.
                  Indeed, while there are medical reports in the file  which
                  have been relied on previously, Mr Bartram has simply  not
                  addressed me on them;


             (b)  First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow pointed out  that  there
                  was medical evidence relied upon in the Article  3  appeal
                  before that judge when it was claimed that  the  appellant
                  would be at risk of Article 3 breach, because there was  a
                  risk of suicide.  There was no up-to-date medical evidence
                  before me to suggest that the appellant had undergone  any
                  treatment for his previously claimed  depression,  neither
                  was there any current medical evidence to suggest that  he
                  was still suffering from depression or that  there  was  a
                  risk that on removal he would commit suicide;


              (c) The sole  basis  on  which  the  appellant's  appeal  was
                  presented was his  sur  place  activities  in  the  United
                  Kingdom and his fear of ill-treatment as a result  of  his
                  activities on behalf of Congo Support  Group  and  APARECO
                  United Kingdom;


             (d)  Mr Bartram even told me that he was not going  to  adduce
                 evidence or make submission in respect of  the  appellant's
                 Article 8 rights;


             (e)  When the appellant appeared before Immigration Judge  Beg
                 he claimed to have a family in the United Kingdom and yet I
                 heard no evidence about this family at all.

Background country evidence

52.   In  order  to  place  the  appellant's  claim  into  context  I  first
    considered the background evidence.

53.  Within the file was a copy of the Country Policy Bulletin published  on
    18th February, 2014 which had been submitted  by  previous  solicitors.
    Although Mr Bartram had not address me on it, I considered it  at  some
    length.

54.  I noted that there had for a number of years been  various  reports  of
    allegations of ill-treatment of returnees to the DRC,  which  had  been
    investigated by the Home Office  working  with  the  FCO  and  that  no
    evidence had been found to substantiate  the  claims  (paragraph  2.1).
    The bulletin referred to the country guidance case of BK (Failed asylum
    seekers) DRC (Rev 1) CG [2007]  UKAIT  00098  and  to  the  Operational
    Guidance Note of May 2012, which recognised that  there  were  specific
    categories of DRC nationals who may be able to demonstrate  a  risk  on
    return to DRC.  I noted the reports on R v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department ex parte P (DRC) and R v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department ex parte R  (DRC)  and  also  noted  the  Fact  Finding
    Mission Report. I read the  policy  bulletin  in  relation  to  Justice
    First: Unsafe Return Repress and  the  conclusion  that  there  was  no
    substantive evidence that conditions  had  changed  since  the  country
    guidance case of BK.

55.  I also read the whole of Sections 6 and 7  and,  although  I  have  not
    been addressed on it, the Refugee Action Group letter of 26 July  2013.
    I noticed that the appellant had been a  full  member  of  the  Refugee
    Action Group since 2006 and had been  involved with the charity work as
    a youth worker since his release from prison.

56.  I also read the Congo Support Group letter of 11th June,  2014,   which
    referred to the appellant and to his wife.  I am aware from having read
    the background material referred to in BM and Others (paragraphs 6,  7,
    8, 9 and 12 in particular) that there are  in  excess  of  200  African
    ethnic groups  within  the  population  and  notwithstanding  its  vast
    natural resources and mineral wealth it is one of the poorest countries
    in the world. Corruption is considered  to  be  rampant  and  following
    independent and three decades  of  dictatorship  under  Colonel  Mobutu
    President Laurent Kabila seized power in 1997. Following his death, his
    son assumed the  office  of  presidency.   During  a  civil  war  which
    involved Rwanda and Uganda more than 3,000,000 people have been  killed
    and despite a peace agreement having been  negotiated, hostilities with
    the FDLR  militia  group  continued  until  a  joint  DRC  UN  military
    operation in 2009.  The country continues to suffer from the activities
    of militias and its official army. Widespread  violence  continued  and
    there were grave human rights violations by armed groups and members of
    the National Security Forces. The last sentence of paragraph 10  of  BM
    reads:-

         "In short, the DRC is a state in which the  rule  of  law  is  both
         fragile and fickle."

57.  At paragraphs 24 to 28 of BM and Others  the  Tribunal  deal  what  the
    Amnesty International Report of  February  2015,  which  describes  the
    arbitrary  arrest  and  detention  of  percussive   regime   opponents,
    perceived critics of  the  security  forces  and  those  percussive  as
    connected to criminal activity.

58.  I have also read the comments of the Presidential panel  at  paragraphs
    29 in dealing with  the  Human  Rights  Watch  evidence,  paragraph  30
    dealing with  the  Observer  newspaper  report  of  15  February  2014,
    Paragraph 31 dealing with the Freedom From Torture  Report,  paragraphs
    32, 33 and 34 dealing with the  UK  Border  Agency  country  of  origin
    information report of March 2012 and paragraphs 35 to 42  dealing  with
    further UK Border Agency Operational Guidance Note and  Bulletins.    I
    have also read paragraph 43  which  deals  with  the  evidence  of  the
    British Ambassador in Kinshasa and I have noted  the  evidence  of  the
    expert at paragraphs 44 to 49 of the report.  In particular I note that
    Dr  Kennes  expresses  certain  opinions  as  to   the   APERECO   (UK)
    organisation and movement and suggests that it is perceived as being  a
    "serious threat" to the president.  He opines that APERECO (UK) members
    and militants who are returned to the DRC as failed asylum seekers:-

         "... Ranked among the category of people who run the highest  level
         of risk for detention, arrest and  cruel,  inhumane  and  degrading
         treatment during interrogations."

59.  I also read paragraphs 50  to  58  dealing  with  further  evidence  of
    APERECO (UK).

60.  I bear in mind of course  that  Apareco  UK  is  only  one  of  several
    APERECO groups operating outside the DRC.

61.  At paragraph 51 the Presidential Tribunal received  evidence  that  the
    witness JM was President of the north west region. The evidence I heard
    from the appellant and from the President made no mention of  the  fact
    that APARECO UK was divided into regions.  At paragraph 55 the Tribunal
    heard evidence that one of appellant it was dealing with was  secretary
    of the Midlands branch  of  APERECO  (UK).  Neither  witness  appearing
    before me referred to APERECO (UK)  having  any  branches  or  regional
    offices. Indeed the appellant claimed to be responsible for England and
    Wales.

62.  At paragraph 87 the Tribunal makes specific  findings  in  relation  to
    APERECO (UK) and I note in particular that the monitoring of Apareco UK
    is likely to be undertaken by and on  behalf  of  the  DRC  Embassy  in
    London.

Country Guidance

63.  I have paid particular attention to the decision in BM and  Others  and
    it is clear to me that if the appellant is found to have a  significant
    and visible profile within APARECO (UK), he is likely to be  a  serious
    risk of harm on return to the DRC.

64.  In  the  light  to  my  consideration  of  the  background  evidence  I
    considered the oral evidence I have heard and made my findings of fact.
     Before doing so, however, I reminded myself of the burden and standard
    of proof.

The Law

65.  In asylum appeals the burden of proof is on the appellant to show  that
    retuning him to the DRC will expose him to a real risk  of  persecution
    for one of the five grounds recognised in the 1951  Refugee  Convention
    or to breach of his protected human rights.  the question of whether  a
    person has a well-founded fear of persecution for a  Convention  reason
    has to be looked at in the round in  the  light  of  all  the  relevant
    circumstances and judged against the situation as at the  time  of  the
    appeal.  In human rights appeals, if it is established that there  will
    be an interference what the appellant's human rights and  the  relevant
    Article permits, then it is for the respondent to  establish  that  the
    interference is justified.

66   The standard of  proof  in  asylum  appeals  as  regards  to  both  the
    likelihood of persecution and the  establishment  of  past  and  future
    risks is a real risk in  Takaj  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department (01/TH/00634*) it was held by the former Immigration  Appeal
    Tribunal that the standard of proof in human rights appeals is the same
    as that in asylum appeals.

Findings of Fact

67.  The appellant has the most appalling immigration history.

Credibility

68.  He also has a history of deception.

69.  On  his arrival in 1990 he used a false name.  On  claiming  asylum  in
    1991 he used a false name and a false date of birth. Again in  1991  he
    made a claim for asylum using a false name and in January 1993  he  was
    detected leaving the United Kingdom for  Belgium  in  possession  of  a
    false passport  belonging to somebody else.  He appears  to  have  left
    the United Kingdom because on 22nd July, 1993 he attempted to  re-enter
    the United Kingdom using a forged passport.  In September 1999  he  was
    convicted at Manchester Crown Court of two counts of obtaining properly
    by deception and sentenced to two years' imprisonment.  It  appears  he
    must have left the United Kingdom again because on 9th  June,  2002  he
    was again detected attempting to re-enter the United  Kingdom  using  a
    Belgian 1951 United Nations travel document  in  the  mane  of  another
    person.  That document was a counterfeit. He then  claimed  asylum  but
    having lodged an appeal he abandoned it. In May 2003 he  was  convicted
    at Bolton Crown Court of conspiracy to defraud  and  sentenced  to  six
    years' imprisonment on 24th October, 2003.  On 30th  October,  2007  he
    was convicted of fraud and sentenced  to  two  years'  imprisonment  by
    Glasgow Sheriffs Court and on 21st February, 2011 he was convicted  and
    sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court of  two  counts  of  conspiracy  to
    defraud.

70.  As I have indicated, in the appeal  before  Immigration  Judge  Beg  in
    2000 the appellant claimed to be HIV positive.  He  has  made  no  such
    claim before me.

71.  In giving evidence to me the appellant told me  that  he  last  entered
    the United Kingdom in 1991. That is blatantly not true.  He was  caught
    in July 1993 attempting to enter the United  Kingdom  and  returned  to
    Belgium.  He subsequently entered the United Kingdom  because  on  20th
    October, 1997 he was convicted at Haringey Magistrates Court.  However,
    on 9 July 2002, he was again caught attempting  to  use  a  counterfeit
    Belgian 1951 United Nations travel document  in  the  name  of  another
    person.

72.  Even before me the appellant refused to tell me  the  truth  about  the
    date he last entered the United Kingdom.

73.  In giving evidence to me he said that he was  one  of  seven  territory
    counsellors but according to the president of APARECO UK the  appellant
    was only one of five territory counsellors.

74.  In giving evidence to me the appellant said he  joined  APARECO  UK  in
    2007 and in 2014 he joined a group  called  Congo  Support  Group.   He
    claimed that he ceased activities for them in December 2014 and decided
    to go back to APERECO (UK).  However, he told Judge Callow in  November
    that he was no longer a member of APERRECO (UK).

75.  The appellant's witness said that the appellant has been  a  member  of
    APARECO (UK) since 2007 and, "has attended all the events and  meetings
    organised  by  our  political  organisation  since  his  enrolment   on
    10/1/2007 as a member of APARECO  (UK)."   However,  according  to  the
    appellant when he gave evidence to  Judge  Callow,  the  appellant  had
    ceased to be a member and when he gave evidence to me, during  2014  he
    was actively involved with Congo Support Group.   I  concluded  that  I
    could not believe anything the appellant  had  said.  There  were  even
    discrepancies in those parts of the  appellant's  evidence  which  were
    supposed to be corroborated by his witness.

76.  Throughout his evidence the appellant appeared to me to  be  making  it
    up as he went along.  He struck me as being someone who was politically
    naï¿½ve. He  was  unable,  despite  being  pressed  by  Mr  Bartram,  and
    subsequently by me, to explain  exactly  what  it  was  he  did  within
    APERECO (UK), or what it was that APARECO UK did.  He told me  that  it
    was not a political party but a party of resistance.  He told  me  that
    it sought to persuade Congolese people in the United Kingdom to  advise
    their relatives in the Congo not to take part in the general elections.
    There was no suggestion that it raised funds in the United  Kingdom  to
    support terrorist activity in the Congo and I had very great difficulty
    in understanding from him or from Mr Likiyo  what  it  did  apart  from
    offering support to  Congo  asylum  seekers  and,  apparently,  holding
    demonstrations against the return of failed asylum seekers to the DRC.

77.  Given the ease with which the appellant  appears  to  change  identity,
    the fact that he claimed to be HIV positive in 2005, but since then and
    despite two further asylum appeals, has not relied on  that  diagnosis,
    his convictions for offences involving deceit, his willingness to  rely
    on false documentation and documentation which does not relate to   him
    in order to attempt to leave and enter the United  Kingdom,  I  believe
    that this appellant is someone who will say and do anything to get what
    he wants.  I do not believe that I can rely on the appellant's word.  I
    believe that he is a complete stranger to the truth.

78.  The Secretary of State's reasons for refusal to  revoke  a  deportation
    order letter dated 19th April, 2013 contain the sentencing  remarks  of
    the judge.  On 21st February 2011 at Birmingham Crown Court  the  judge
    stated:-

         "For the fourth time in twelve years you have come before  a  court
         charged with conspiracy arising out of benefit fraud.  On  previous
         occasions you were sentenced in 1999 to two years and  in  2003  to
         six years and then in 2007 to two years and I am told that you were
         released from  custody  into  immigration  remand  status  on  20th
         February, 2009. So far as this conspiracy is  concerned,  you  have
         commenced involvement very soon after release. The use of the false
         name, Kingombe, in your case, commenced on 15th September, 2009 and
         lasted through to 7th May and in that false name alone you obtained
         just over ï¿½16,500.


         The method that you were using on this  occasion  is  the  same  as
         previously. Someone inside the postal service intercepts giros  and
         also bank cards.  The giros are manipulated by fairly sophisticated
         means so that the names are changed.  The code for the identity  of
         the post office which is to be used to cash giros  is  altered  and
         where appropriate bank cards, the names are altered to match stolen
         bank  cards  so  that  if  identification  is  required   for   the
         manipulation cheque the bank card can be  used.  Cheques  are  then
         either presented to a bank, as happened in your case, or  in  other
         cases they are presented to the post office and cash obtained  with
         the support of false documentation, as I have mentioned.


         It goes without saying that this conspiracy is professional.  It is
         fraud from the outset.  It involves  other  crimes,  the  theft  of
         material through  the  post  office  and  it  causes  distress  and
         inconvenience to those who should have obtained  these  cheques  in
         the normal course.  In your case, the main bulk of  your  offending
         involved this false identity of Kingham led to  paying  in  cheques
         into a false account, a false account  which  in  itself  had  been
         obtained by the use of a false  French  passport.   So,  as  it  is
         accepted, you are not simply a presenter of cheques  with  a  false
         bank account, bearing in mind all that one knows about you and what
         other items were found at your address, it is plain  that  you  are
         close to others involved in this conspiracy, as I say,  not  simply
         you were the sole trader within the  conspiracy.  Where  you  stand
         entirely in the conspiracy is not necessarily completely clear.


         Again it is accepted that I should look at you as  someone  who  is
         therefore committing  a  fraud  within  the  range  of  ï¿½20,000  to
         ï¿½100,000 precisely where not known. But the false address that  you
         were using, I add, has  other  false  cheques  also  sent  to  that
         address and it is your own address.  You had further cheques  which
         were yet to be manipulated.  You  had  some  equipment  with  which
         manipulation could occur, albeit you do not accept  that  you  were
         using it for them. And I stress simply earlier on in  the  case  in
         your presence, it seemed to me that bearing  in  mind  the  amounts
         here I cannot say that this is as serious as the case of Bolton but
         bearing in mind this is now your fourth  conviction  of  a  similar
         nature, it seems  to  me  your  case  was  worse  than  your  first
         conviction and worse than your last  offence  and  however  I  find
         myself looking at the case, it seems to me that had you been  tried
         before me and  convicted  on  this  basis,  bearing  in  mind  your
         previous convictions, I would have found you liable to  a  sentence
         after trial of, let us say, four years, the middleish range and the
         starting point for a person of good character, but  then  add  into
         your previous convictions, the range would have been of  the  level
         of four years."

79.  In his  asylum  appeal  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Afako  the
    appellant relied on his claimed involvement  with  APERECO  (UK)  since
    2009, claiming to have been involved actively in organising marches  in
    London, but was not in any  position  to  provide  any  other  form  of
    evidence such as photographs, videos or  other  testimony  from  fellow
    marches to confirm that a march  took  place.  The  Tribunal  were  not
    satisfied therefore that  the  appellant  was  genuinely  a  member  of
    APERECO (UK). If he had any connection at all with  that  organisation,
    they considered it to be purely opportunistic.

80.  I see no reason at all to disagree with that  finding,  indeed  I  make
    the same finding.  The appellant was unable to explain to me  his  role
    within the organisation or,  indeed,  what  the  organisation  actually
    does.  Neither was the President, Mr Likiyo and I  was  left  with  the
    impression that whatever it had been at  the  time  the  Tribunal  were
    hearing evidence in BM and Others, the United  Kingdom  branch  of  the
    organisation is now very little more than a support group for Congolese
    Asylum seekers.

Credibility of Mr Likiyo

81.  The letter from Mr Ernest Likiyo of 20th April,  2015  is  not  helpful
    either.   It said:-

         "I Ernest Likiyo President of APARECO/London (Patriarchal  Alliance
         for the Rebuilding of  Congo)  would  like  to  confirm  that  [the
         appellant] date of birth 3/3/1960 in AKETI/DRC is an active  member
         of APERECO (UK).


         Mr WY is in charge of counselling members about  upcoming  meetings
         of APERECO (UK).


         I would like to inform that the regime of Kabila  is  really  risky
         and huge threat for all members of APERECO (UK).  The actual regime
         of Kabila in the DRC has published different photographs of members
         of APERECO (UK) in order to be killed.  His  safety  is  in  danger
         should you decide to deport her to the DRC, which means he will not
         be secured by the actual government of Kabila, because of political
         approach and speech of APERECO (UK) which do  not  agree  with  the
         actual regime of Mr Kabila and his political  system  of  governing
         the DRC.


         APERECO (UK) is a political organisation which  believes  that  its
         members are at serious menace if deported to the  DRC,  because  of
         Kabila's perspective which is against APERECO (UK).


         I can certify that several of our supporters and members  who  have
         been deported to the DRC are all tortured and killed; that is why I
         believe that Mr W Y will be in danger of death."


82.  I thought it undermined the witness's credibility that he told me  that
    he had credible evidence that supporters and members  of  APERECO  (UK)
    from the United Kingdom have been returned  to  the  DRC  and  suffered
    torture and been killed, and yet he  had  not  provided  that  credible
    evidence to the Home Office.   I pointed out to him that if he did have
    credible evidence of the killing and torture of people returned to  the
    DRC by the British government, and sent it to the Home Office, he would
    certainly have ended all returns of people to the DRC from  the  United
    Kingdom and probably from the whole of  Europe.   Instead  he  told  me
    that he had written on previous occasions to the  Home  Secretary  and,
    not having received a reply, had decided not to write to her.  That  is
    simply not believable.

83.  In giving evidence to me, Mr Likiyo told me that APERECO (UK)  was  not
    a political  organisation  and  yet  according  to  his  letter  it  is
    political. He also described it as being a resistance organisation, but
    could not point to any ways  in  which  APERECO  (UK)  or  its  members
    actually resisted the DRC government.

84.  The appellant took part  in  the  interview  with  BEN  TV.   The  only
    reference to APERECO (UK)  is  where  the  interviewer  introduces  the
    appellant.  The extract is as follows:-

         "Interviewer: I think you are following that interview, now we  are
             going to meet with the territorial adviser of APERECO (UK)  in
             UK.


         W:  Thank you for wanting to know the opinion of APERECO (UK) in UK
             on this stage.  APERECO (UK), Alliance Des Patriotes  Pour  La
             Refomdation Du Congo.  Let me first introduced myself. My name
             is YW.  I am the territorial advisor of APERECO  (UK)  in  UK.
             I am in  charge  of  mobilisation  and  strategy  and  I  also
             supervise London and  the  Wales.   We  here  in  England  are
             mourning the loss our assistant treasurer Bokulu  Botsua.   He
             was a really great activist in our community of combatants.  I
             thank again our national leader for his message  in  which  he
             revealed the foreigners  who have  invaded  our  country;  our
             country which is now under  foreign  occupation.   I  want  to
             think the Congolese people  who  are  receiving  this  message
             today, who are standing for our country  which  is  now  under
             foreign occupation.   Now concerning these two slogans  of  Be
             Warned and Stay Longer,  for  Stay  Longer;  there  are  those
             people who are supporting those who are occupying our  country
             and as for Be Warned, we find it meaningless since our country
             is under occupation.  I am calling on all the Congolese people
             to unite around our leader Mr Honore Ngbanda.  Yes! Yes!"

85.  There was no other reference to APARECO UK in that interview  in  which
    the appellant  describes himself as being the territorial adviser.

86.  The appellant claims to have been on  demonstrations  and  while  I  am
    satisfied that the appellant has lied to me in giving his  evidence,  I
    am satisfied that he is shown as being a participant in a demonstration
    which took place, he claims in  2014,  in  Whitehall  opposite  Downing
    Street.

87.  My conclusion in relation to APARECO UK is now very little more than  a
    support group for Congolese Asylum seekers.  It  provides  support  and
    assistance (including advice on the law) to  Congolese  asylum  seekers
    and takes part in activity aimed at demonstrating  against  the  United
    Kingdom's policy of deporting failed  asylum  seekers  to  the  DRC.  I
    accept also that as part of its demonstrations it calls for the removal
    of the Kabila regime.

Conclusion

88.  I  do  not  believe  that  the  appellant's  having  taken  part  in  a
    demonstration will necessarily lead  to  him  being  identified  as  an
    APERECO activist on return to DRC, but given  that  the  appellant  has
    taken part in a television programme which was broadcast on African  TV
    by the Skye network, in which he is described as being  a  "territorial
    advisor to APERECO (UK)" and  being  "in  charge  of  mobilisation  and
    strategy",  I  am  forced  to  conclude  that  there  is  a  reasonable
    likelihood that on return to the DRC this appellant will be  questioned
    as to his activities on behalf of  APERECO  (UK).   I  appreciate  that
    APERECO has branches elsewhere other than in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    that the activities of APERECO elsewhere in the  world  may  very  well
    cause the DRC government to have a strong interest in it, such that the
    appellant's involvement with APERECO (UK) is likely to cause him to  be
    at risk of persecution and serious ill-treatment.

89.  Whilst I find the appellant to be a man whose word  cannot  be  trusted
    and who has deliberately used deceit throughout his time in the  United
    Kingdom, I cannot ignore the fact that there is a real danger  that  he
    will be at  risk  on  his  return,  albeit  that  he  has  deliberately
    manufactured such risk with the intention of  securing  asylum  in  the
    United Kingdom.

Decision

90.  The appellant is entitled to be recognised as a  refugee  and  I  allow
    his asylum appeal. It follows that  I  allow  his  appeal  against  the
    refusal of the Secretary of State to revoke the deportation order.

    No anonymity direction is made.
