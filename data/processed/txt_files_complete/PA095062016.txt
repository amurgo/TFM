               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Maguire,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent refused the appellant's  protection  claim  for  reasons
    explained in her letter dated 26 August 2016.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge David C Clapham SSC dismissed the appellant's
    appeal by decision promulgated on 20 April 2017.

 3. The appellant applied on 25 April 2017 for permission to appeal to  the
    UT, stating brief grounds.  In a decision  dated  23  August  2017  FtT
    Judge Nightingale explained that those grounds were  misconceived,  and
    refused permission.

 4. The appellant applied to the UT for permission on  13  September  2017,
    stating one ground, headed as "errors of law in relation to AA (Iraq) v
    SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 944", set out in sub-paragraphs (i) - (viii).

 5. That application, in terms of the TP (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23 (1A), now
    stands as the notice of appeal to the UT.

 6. On 9 October 2017 UT Judge Lindsley granted permission, observing:

      It is arguable ... that the decision is not sufficiently reasoned with
      respect to points 9 - 11 of the revised country  guidance  in  AA  ...
      with respect to [the appellant's] CSID and as  to  how  the  appellant
      would safely reach the IKR at point 20.   It  is  also  arguable  that
      there is no  article  8  ECHR  decision  addressing  very  significant
      obstacles to integration and ï¿½276ADE of the immigration rules.

 7. (The latter comment by the judge granting permission does not appear to
    arise from the grounds of appeal, but the matter was not  taken  up  by
    the appellant and does not  require  any  resolution,  considering  the
    outcome on the grounds.)

 8. The further grounds  mainly  flow  from  (i):  failure  to  make  clear
    findings on what documentation the appellant has, or is able to obtain.

 9. In response to submissions, the respondent conceded the point, and  the
    outcome set out below was agreed.

10. The following, however, needs to be observed.

11. The  appellant's  solicitors  sent  further  evidence  to  the  UT:  in
    particular, an expert report under cover of a letter dated 27  November
    2017, faxed to the UT at 16:20 that day, and provided to the respondent
    at about the same time.

12.  Mr Winter said that the evidence would become  relevant  only  of  the
    decision were to be remade, while Mr Matthews indicated  that  if  that
    stage were reached, he maintained  that  the  evidence  should  not  be
    admitted.

13. Mr Matthews referred to the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008, rule 15 (2A):
      In an asylum case or an immigration case-
      (a) if a party wishes the Upper Tribunal to consider evidence that was
      not before the First-tier Tribunal, that party must send or deliver  a
      notice to the Upper Tribunal and any other party-
      (i) indicating the nature of the evidence; and
      (ii) explaining why it was not submitted to the First-tier Tribunal;
    and

      (b) when considering whether to admit evidence that was not before the
      First-tier Tribunal, the Upper Tribunal must have  regard  to  whether
      there has been unreasonable delay in producing that evidence.

14. He pointed out that the UT had issued its usual directions, citing that
    rule, and advising parties that failure to comply "will be regarded  as
    a serious matter and may result in fresh or further evidence not  being
    considered by the tribunal".

15. The directions specify that any notice pursuant to rule 15 (2A) must be
    sent 10 working days before the hearing of the appeal, at latest.

16. It was apparent that neither solicitors nor the  expert  had  perceived
    any necessity to provide evidence promptly, or to comply with rules and
    directions.

17. Plainly, the appellant failed to provide the notice required, and there
    has been unreasonable delay.

18. This is not a question of insistence on  superficial  formalities;  the
    respondent was not given an adequate or fair  opportunity  to  consider
    the proposed evidence.

19. There is an unfortunate culture of heedless non-compliance  with  rules
    and directions in this tribunal, in which present  representatives  are
    no better (although no worse) than others.

20. There would have  been  a  strong  case  for  declining  to  admit  the
    evidence. The appellant is under an obligation to conduct his  case  by
    the rules, even if not specifically directed to do so.  He had been  so
    directed, and  clearly  told  of  the  possible  consequences  of  non-
    compliance.  It makes little difference that the evidence was to go  to
    remaking the decision rather than to legal  error;  directions  require
    the parties to assume that will happen at  the  same  hearing,  and  to
    prepare accordingly.

21. Although representatives are accustomed to tolerance of  non-compliance
    with rules and directions, they should bear in mind that  lenience  has
    its limits, and they could scarcely have complained if  this  case  had
    been found to go beyond those limits.

22. On this occasion, the issue is  elided  by  agreement  on  the  further
    procedure to take place.

23. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

24. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

25. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge David C Clapham.

26. The FtT in its fresh decision should bear in mind the  need  to  decide
    clearly the extent to which the  appellant  establishes  (or  fails  to
    establish) his case on such matters as whether he has ever had identity
    documents; the current whereabouts of any such documents;  his  ability
    to retrieve or replace such documents; his  family  circumstances;  and
    his contact, or absence of contact, with family and friends.

27. The FtT should of course be assisted by  clear  submissions  from  both
    parties on which specific findings it is invited to make, and on  their
    basis in the evidence (or in the absence of sufficient evidence).

28. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
