Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
point of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal should apply to the  Upper
Tribunal for permission, at the hearing at which the decision is  given.  If
no application is made,  the  Tribunal  must  nonetheless  consider  at  the
hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule 44(4B)  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).

Judge Kebede:

1.   This in an application for judicial  review  of  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department dated 30 April 2019 refusing
    the applicant's application for leave to remain as a Tier  2  (General)
    Migrant and the decision of 18 June 2019 maintaining that refusal on an
    administrative review. The application  also  seeks  to  challenge  the
    linked and corresponding decisions  for  the  applicant's  wife,  Ummay
    Aimon, dated 21 May 2019 and 19 June 2019  respectively,  refusing  her
    application as the dependant of a points-based-system migrant. I  shall
    refer to the main  applicant  as  'the  applicant',  since  his  wife's
    application stands or falls with his application.

 2. Permission to apply for judicial review was granted on the papers on 24
    March 2021 by Upper Tribunal Judge Sheridan.

 3. The applicant is a national of Bangladesh, born on 22 December 1981. He
    first entered the UK on 27 October 2009 with leave to enter as a Tier 4
    (General) Student and was granted further periods of  leave  to  remain
    until 30 April 2017 on the same basis. His wife entered the UK  as  his
    dependant on 27 November 2013 and was granted leave in line as a Tier 4
    dependent partner. Prior to their leave expiring,  on  28  April  2017,
    they made FLR (HRO) applications for further  leave  to  remain,  which
    they subsequently varied to FLR (FP) applications on 4  September  2017
    and then to  Tier  2  leave  applications  on  21  November  2017.  The
    applications were refused on 30 November 2017 and, following a  request
    for an administrative review,  the  decisions  were  maintained  on  11
    January 2018. The applicants' 3C leave came to an end at that point. On
    24 January 2018 the applicants made fresh applications under the Tier 2
    (General) Migrant category, but their applications were refused  again,
    on 5 July 2018. The decisions were, however, reconsidered  following  a
    successful administrative review on 11 August 2018, although they  were
    refused again, on 30 April 2019 for the applicant and 21 May  2019  for
    his wife. Requests for an administrative review were  made  on  21  May
    2019 and 3 June 2019 respectively, but were rejected, with the relevant
    decisions being 18 June 2019 and 19 June 2019 respectively.

 4. It is necessary, by way of background, to give some details  about  the
    applicant's  Tier  2  applications.  I  take  these  details  from  the
    Respondent's Detailed Grounds of  Defence  and  the  documents  in  the
    bundle.

 5. The first Tier 2 application made by the applicant on 21 November  2017
    was in relation to his prospective employment  as  a  public  relations
    officer with Sphinx Fine  Art.  That  application  was  refused  on  30
    November 2017 on the basis that the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) he
    had provided had been cancelled by UKVI after the  sponsor  surrendered
    their licence and were no longer permitted to sponsor migrants.

 6. The second Tier 2 application, made on 24 January 2018, was in relation
    to prospective employment as a business  consultant  with  1st  Contact
    Money Limited T/A 1st Contact FX & Sable  FX.  The  respondent,  before
    making a  decision  in  that  application,  decided  to  interview  the
    applicant as there were concerns about an  ETS  certificate  previously
    provided and, furthermore, there were  concerns  that  the  applicant's
    intended role in the sponsoring company was potentially  a  non-genuine
    vacancy as a result of which further investigation  was  required.  The
    applicant attended an ETS interview on 3 April 2018 and the  respondent
    was satisfied with the answers he gave and did not take matters further
    in that regard. However, on 25 June 2018, the respondent  was  informed
    by the applicant's sponsor that they did not know him and that they had
    not assigned the CoS to him. The respondent's GCID notes reflected that
    and the applicant's application was then refused, on 5  July  2018,  on
    the basis that the respondent was satisfied  that  the  CoS  was  false
    because the sponsor had stated that they did not know him and  had  not
    assigned a CoS to him. Nevertheless, on 11 August  2018,  following  an
    administrative review request made by the applicant in which he claimed
    that he was the innocent victim of some unknown  events,  that  he  had
    obtained  the  CoS  legitimately  and  that  he  had  no  idea  of  the
    allegation, the respondent withdrew the decision of 5  July  2018.  The
    applicant's application was then re-considered  and  re-refused  on  30
    April 2019.

 7. In that decision, of 30 April 2019, the respondent noted that the  fact
    that a CoS had been assigned  to  the  applicant  by  the  sponsor  1st
    Contact Money Limited T/A 1st Contact FX & Sable FX was contradicted by
    the information received from the key  contact  at  1st  Contact  Money
    Limited T/A 1st Contact FX & Sable FX on 25 July 2018 [this should read
    25 June 2018], but in any  event  the  sponsor  had  surrendered  their
    licence on 30 October 2018 and were  no  longer  permitted  to  sponsor
    migrants.  The  CoS  provided  was  therefore  no  longer   valid   and
    accordingly the applicant was awarded zero points for  sponsorship  and
    salary under Appendix A: Attributes and zero points under  Appendix  C:
    Maintenance (funds). His  application  was  accordingly  refused  under
    paragraph 245HD(f) of the immigration rules.

 8. In the applicant's application for an  administrative  review  of  that
    decision, it was submitted that the  respondent  had  failed  to  apply
    common law fairness and he should have been  given  an  opportunity  to
    submit a new CoS, by way of a  60-day  letter.  It  was  asserted  that
    unfairness had arisen as a result of him having  made  his  application
    via a super priority service in  January  2018,  yet  not  receiving  a
    decision until 30 April 2019; as a result of the respondent  previously
    refusing an application on a  ground  of  alleged  deception  but  then
    withdrawing that decision without explaining why the existence of a CoS
    had been denied; and as a result of contradictory  information  arising
    from the respondent stating the sponsor had contacted the  Home  Office
    on 25 July 2018 confirming they had no record of  assigning  a  CoS  or
    offering employment but the application being refused before that  date
    on 5 July 2018.

 9.  In  the  decision  of  18  June  2019,  the  respondent  rejected  the
    administrative review request on the basis that the  application  ought
    to have been, but was not, accompanied by the relevant fee.

10. Following the pre-action  protocol  process,  the  applicant  lodged  a
    judicial review claim on 29 July 2019 seeking to challenge the decision
    to refuse his application for leave to remain on the grounds  that  the
    respondent's decision was procedurally unfair, substantively unfair and
    unreasonable and that it unlawfully interfered with his Article 8 human
    rights.

11. In the first ground, asserting procedural unfairness, it was  submitted
    that, given the earlier incorrect  refusal  of  5  July  2018  and  the
    withdrawal of the allegation of deception,  and  considering  that  the
    applicant had made his application via  a  super  priority  service  in
    January 2018 yet had not received a decision until 30 April  2019,  the
    respondent ought to have alerted the applicant to the  concerns  before
    making a decision. The case of Balajigari v The Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2019]  EWCA  Civ  673  was  relied  upon  in  that
    respect, in relation to the absence of a 'minded to'  process.  In  the
    second ground, asserting substantive unfairness,  the  applicant  again
    relied upon  the  delay  in  his  application  being  decided  and  the
    prejudice caused as a result. He also referred  to  the  Supreme  Court
    having granted permission in Pathan & Anor v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 2103 on the basis of the argument  that
    a similar policy should be applied in Tier 2 cases to that set  out  in
    Patel (revocation of sponsor licence - fairness) India [2011] UKUT  211
    and Thakur (PBS decision - common law fairness) Bangladesh [2011]  UKUT
    151 in relation to Tier 4 applications. Reference was also made to  the
    contradiction in the respondent claiming that the sponsor had contacted
    the Home Office on 25 July 2018 stating that  they  had  no  record  of
    assigning a CoS or offering  employment,  but  then  stating  that  the
    application was refused before  that  date  on  5  July  2018.  It  was
    asserted again that the respondent ought to have given the applicant an
    opportunity to find another employer and make another  application.  In
    the third ground the applicant, relying upon Ahsan v The  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department (Rev 1) [2017] EWCA  Civ  2009,  asserted
    that he had raised a human rights claim which the respondent  ought  to
    have considered and to have found in his favour.

12. The respondent responded to those points  in  the  summary  grounds  of
    defence, noting as a preliminary  matter  that,  by  virtue  of  having
    failed to pay the fee for the administrative review, the applicant  had
    not exhausted his remedies before bringing this claim. In regard to the
    first ground, the respondent noted that the  Supreme  Court  had  since
    issued a judgment in the case of Pathan, R (on the  application  of)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] UKSC 41 but contended
    that it did not assist the applicant and set out three main differences
    between Pathan and the applicant's case: firstly, in Pathan,  the  SSHD
    had  unilaterally  revoked  the  sponsor's  licence,  whereas  in   the
    applicant's case the sponsor had surrendered its licence and  therefore
    the binding authorities in EK (Ivory Coast) v The  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2014] EWCA  Civ  1517  and  Raza,  R  (on  the
    application of) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]
    EWCA Civ 36 applied; secondly, Pathan concerned an  applicant  who  was
    seeking to extend his leave with the same employer when the  revocation
    happened, whereas the applicant was not historically an employee of the
    sponsor company who would be continuing work for the same  employer  if
    he was granted leave; and thirdly, the applicant  did  not  have  valid
    leave at the time of the application for leave to  remain  and  was  an
    overstayer, like the  applicant  Raza  and  like  the  co-appellant  in
    Pathan, Islam, who was refused permission  to  appeal  by  the  Supreme
    Court. As for the second ground, substantive unfairness, the respondent
    noted  that  the  Court  in  Pathan  made  it  clear  that  substantive
    unfairness was not a self-standing head  of  judicial  review  and  the
    respondent asserted that the applicant could not succeed on  the  basis
    that the decision was irrational. With regard to the third ground,  the
    respondent submitted that the applicant had not  made  a  human  rights
    application and his PBS application could not be considered as a  human
    rights claim.

13. The applicant then filed a reply to the  summary  grounds,  reiterating
    the  points  previously  made  and  asserting,  inter  alia,  that  the
    preliminary point raised by the respondent was incorrect as  there  was
    no payment required for the administrative review.

14. Permission was granted by UTJ Sheridan on the papers, on 24 March 2021,
    on the following basis:

         "It was arguably procedurally unfair that the  respondent  did  not
         notify the applicants that the sponsor had surrendered its  licence
         and that the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) had  been  cancelled.
         Although there are  significant  differences  between  the  factual
         matrix in these proceedings and in Pathan, R  (on  the  application
         of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] UKSC 41  it
         is arguable that there was procedural unfairness in this case given
         that the applicants did not know about the cancellation of the  CoS
         and that they did not do anything improper or unlawful."

15. Mr Harland filed detailed grounds of defence for the  respondent.  With
    regard to the preliminary matter, the respondent  considered  that  the
    administrative review was not still pending as  it  had  been  properly
    rejected for non-payment of the relevant fee. The  respondent  set  out
    the same arguments as previously stated in  the  summary  grounds,  but
    expanded upon those arguments, relying on the line of authorities which
    had been preserved by the Supreme Court in Pathan, including EK  (Ivory
    Coast) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ
    1517, Mudiyanselage v The Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2018] EWCA Civ 65 and Raza, R (on the application of) v The  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 36, and  referring  to
    the subsequent cases of Topadar, R (On the Application Of) v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1525 and  Taj,  R  (On
    the Application Of) v The Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2021] EWCA Civ 19 where reliance upon  Pathan  in  arguing  procedural
    unfairness was rejected.

16. The matter then came before me for a substantive hearing. Both  parties
    made  submissions  relying  on,  and  expanding  upon,  their  skeleton
    arguments and I shall refer to those submissions in the  discussion  to
    follow.

    Discussion

17. The fundamental issue in this case, and the main ground  of  challenge,
    concerns the principle of procedural  unfairness,  where  the  relevant
    requirements were set out by Lord Mustill in the case of R v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department, ex  p.  Doody  [1993]  UKHL  8.  Both
    parties are agreed on those principles and the fact that it is a  fact-
    sensitive matter,  but  they  disagree  on  how  those  principles  are
    applied.

18. It is the applicant's case that fairness requires that the Secretary of
    State should have informed him of the sponsor having surrendered  their
    licence and thus provided him with prior notice  of  the  intention  to
    refuse his application for leave to remain so giving him an opportunity
    to rectify the situation by finding  a  new  sponsor.  However,  as  Mr
    Harland submitted, the relevant line of authorities in such cases makes
    it clear that, as a general  principle,  there  is  no  duty  upon  the
    Secretary of State to notify an applicant of  factors  adverse  to  his
    application prior to refusing it. That is subject to the  exception  in
    the line  of  authorities  commencing  with  Patel  and  Thakur,  which
    addressed the situation, in Tier 4  cases,  where  the  respondent  was
    responsible  for  the  application  failing.  The  exception  was  also
    extended by Balajigari to cases  involving  allegations  of  fraud  and
    deception where fairness required that there  be  a  'minded-to-refuse'
    process, as well as in ETS cases where an  interview  was  required  in
    order for matters to be put to the applicant.

19. It is Mr Karim's submission that Pathan extended the exception  further
    to Tier 2  cases  and  that  the  applicant's  case  fell  within  that
    exception, since it was not his fault that his application failed, that
    it could not be said that he acted improperly in any way and  that  the
    circumstances which led to the failure of his application were  outside
    his control. Furthermore, it was the Secretary of  State's  fault  that
    led to the current situation, through her failure to notify him of  the
    sponsor's surrender of their licence  on  30  October  2018,  some  six
    months before  the  decision  of  30  April  2019,  and  the  delay  in
    considering his application contrary to the  expectations  of  a  super
    priority service. He submitted that if the  applicant  had  had  notice
    between those six months, he would have had ample time to do  something
    about his situation.

20. However, I agree with Mr Harland that the applicant's case was, rather,
    determined by the line of authorities which made a distinction in cases
    where the Secretary of State bore no responsibility for the failure  of
    the application. Mr Harland relied, in that respect, upon the  case  of
    Mudiyanselage which made it clear that that  exception  did  not  apply
    where the applicant had failed to supply correct  information  and  the
    cases such as EK (Ivory Coast) and Rahman v SSHD [2014]  EWCA  Civ  11,
    where the  sponsor  had  made  an  error.  He  also  referred  to  Lord
    Underhill's comment, at [53] of Talpada, R (On the  Application  Of)  v
    The Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  841,
    that when it came to considering fairness and who was  responsible  for
    mistakes, the sponsor and the applicant  were  indistinguishable:  "But
    the issue is not whether the outcome is hard on  him  but  whether  the
    Secretary of State has acted unfairly; and from that point of  view  it
    is not appropriate to distinguish between him and his sponsor".  As  Mr
    Harland submitted, the principles in those cases were not overruled  or
    distinguished in Pathan and indeed EK (Ivory  Coast)  was  specifically
    cited at [190] of Pathan. Furthermore,  those  principles  were  relied
    upon in cases subsequent to Pathan such as  Topadar  and  Taj,  in  the
    former case where the sponsor had failed to reply to  the  respondent's
    enquiry  and  in  the  latter  where  there  were  concerns  about  the
    genuineness of a business following an interview  with  the  applicant.
    Although those cases vary in their facts,  the  principles  remain  the
    same and I do not agree with Mr Karim that they  can  be  distinguished
    from the applicant's case.

21. As Mr Harland submitted, the applicant in Pathan succeeded on the basis
    of his case falling within the category of those where  the  respondent
    was  responsible  for  the  application  failing,  having  revoked  the
    sponsor's licence, as in Patel and Thakur and was thus  distinguishable
    from the applicant's circumstances.  Whilst  Mr  Karim  submitted  that
    there was no real distinction between the revocation of  the  sponsor's
    licence by the respondent and the  surrender  of  the  licence  by  the
    sponsor leading to the cancellation of the CoS, I agree with Mr Harland
    that it was in fact a material distinction. Although the  Secretary  of
    State cancelled the CoS, that was not  an  exercise  of  discretion  to
    revoke the licence but was the inevitable consequence  of  the  sponsor
    surrendering their licence. The Secretary of State's role was therefore
    limited and, as Mr Harland submitted, was passive.

22. Mr Harland relied upon  two  further  reasons  for  distinguishing  the
    applicant's case from Pathan,  both  of  which,  like  the  first,  are
    persuasive.

23. Firsly, unlike Mr Pathan, the applicant was an overstayer at  the  time
    of his application and, as such, his circumstances are similar to those
    of Mr Islam, the other applicant in the case of Pathan [2018] EWCA  Civ
    2103 in the Court of Appeal. In the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Singh
    said at [51] and [52]:

         "51. The other decision of this Court is R (Raza) v  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 36;  [2016]  Imm  AR
         682. That case too concerned a Tier 4 student. It  is  clear  from
         para. 13 and paras. 27-30 that submissions were made on behalf  of
         the Secretary of State to the effect that the  decision  in  Patel
         was wrong and had subsequently been disapproved by this Court.  In
         giving the main  judgment  Christopher  Clarke  LJ  rejected  that
         submission: see para. 38. However, he did  not  think  that  Patel
         assisted the appellant in that case because it was distinguishable
         on its facts. This is because, at the time when the appellant made
         his application to extend leave to remain, he was not  any  longer
         lawfully present in the UK with leave to remain as a student:  see
         paras. 14 and 16-18.

         52. The decision of this  Court  in  Raza  presents  a  formidable
         difficulty for the Second Appellant, Mr Islam, as Mr Biggs  fairly
         acknowledged. Mr Biggs sought to distinguish Raza  but  I  am  not
         persuaded that it is possible to do so."

24. Notably, permission was denied to Mr Islam to  appeal  to  the  Supreme
    Court. In so far as the applicant relies upon the fact that he had made
    his application during the 14 days 'grace period', Mr  Harland  pointed
    out that that was also the case with Mr Islam and, further,  that  that
    did not prevent him from being an overstayer once his 3C leave  expired
    on 11 January 2018. Contrary to Mr Karim's assertion, the applicant  is
    clearly not assisted by the case of Hoque &  Ors  v  The  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department (Rev 1) [2020] EWCA Civ 1357, as his is a
    case of 'open-ended overstaying'  and  not  'book-ended  gaps'  in  his
    leave. As for Mr  Karim's  submission  that  being  an  overstayer  was
    immaterial as the applicant had still laid down roots  in  the  UK  and
    lived here for many years, the fact is that his last period  of  actual
    leave expired as long ago  as  in  April  2017.  Since  that  time  his
    presence in the UK has been solely on the basis of  extended  3C  leave
    and a second attempt to apply for Tier 2 leave. The distinction of  his
    status as an overstayer  is,  in  the  circumstances,  a  relevant  and
    material factor.

25. Secondly, Pathan concerned an applicant who was already an  established
    employee for the sponsor when he applied for leave to  remain,  whereas
    the applicant in this case had not yet started working for the sponsor.
    The relevance of Mr Pathan's established employment was made  clear  in
    Pathan at (70] and [71]:

         "The Secretary of State has  accepted  an  obligation  to  give  a
         window of opportunity to migrant  workers  who  become  unemployed
         when their sponsor loses his licence. It seems to me that fairness
         demands  that  the  Secretary  of  State  accepts   some   similar
         obligation to tell the applicant, who is also  an  employee  of  a
         sponsor, of the revocation to give  him  too  time  "to  sort  his
         affairs out". It is not really an answer to say that his leave had
         expired. He would have been planning his affairs on the basis that
         he would be granted a new Tier 2 Migrant visa.  He  is  likely  to
         have engaged the same sort of commitments as other migrant workers
         of the sponsor. Moreover,  employees  who  have  already  obtained
         their Tier 2 leave are allowed to look for  other  sponsors  which
         suggest that the stated  aim  of  Tier  2  to  match  migrants  to
         particular  vacancies  can,  as  one  would  expect,  equally   be
         satisfied  by  matching  resident  labour  market   shortages   to
         migrants.

         We are not concerned with a new applicant or an  applicant  for  a
         new position. It would not be reasonable to expect  the  Secretary
         of State to assume that such applicants would have commitments."

26. As for Mr Karim's submission that the applicant had done nothing  wrong
    and that the situation in which he found himself was due to the sponsor
    and the Secretary of  State,  with  him  having  no  knowledge  of  the
    situation, I refer again to the line of authorities including EK (Ivory
    Coast) and Talpada which pre-dated but survived Pathan, and Topadar and
    Taj  which  followed  Pathan,  all  of  which  made  it   clear   that,
    irrespective of wrongdoing by the applicant  himself,  any  mistake  or
    failing by the sponsor was attributable to the applicant when  it  came
    to the question of the SSHD's duty to notify. Furthermore, I agree with
    Mr Harland in his submission that the applicant must have been aware of
    the precariousness of his situation from the refusal  of  his  previous
    Tier  2  application,  whereby  he  was  specifically  warned  in   the
    administrative review refusal decision of 11 January  2018  (page  110)
    that the onus was on him to keep in contact with his sponsor. He  would
    also have been aware from the refusal decision  of  5  July  2018  that
    there was an issue with the sponsor claiming not to know him and  ought
    reasonably to have been expected to make contact with  the  sponsor  to
    confirm the offer of employment, irrespective of the decision  and  the
    allegation of fraud having subsequently been withdrawn. Further, as  Mr
    Harland submitted, the fact that the sponsor  subsequently  surrendered
    their licence because they no longer  had  a  need  for  one,  provided
    additional reason to conclude that the sponsor did not wish to  sponsor
    the applicant.

27. With respect to Mr Karim's assertion that the respondent was ultimately
    responsible for the applicant's situation as a  result  of  "delay  and
    dithering", Mr Harland properly referred to the GCID notes showing that
    the Secretary of State was not aware of the relevance  of  the  sponsor
    having surrendered  their  licence  until  she  came  to  consider  the
    applicant's application. I agree with Mr Harland, furthermore, that the
    fact that the applicant applied under the super priority  process  adds
    very little to his case  as  the  process  did  not  guarantee  a  fast
    resolution in every case and certainly not where there were, as in this
    case, proper reasons for further investigations to be carried out.  The
    fact that the decision of 5 July 2018 was withdrawn did not negate  the
    fact that there were concerns raised by the sponsor  denying  knowledge
    of the applicant which required investigation. Clearly  the  respondent
    was  progressing  the  matter  and  accordingly  I  reject  Mr  Karim's
    suggestion that any delay  in  deciding  the  application  resulted  in
    responsibility of the  failure  of  the  application  laying  with  the
    respondent.

28. In any event, as Mr  Harland  submitted,  the  challenge  made  by  the
    applicant in regard to the issue of delay  was  in  fact  entering  the
    territory of substantive unfairness rather than procedural  unfairness,
    whereas the Court, in Pathan, made it clear that substantive unfairness
    was not a self-standing head of  judicial  review  and  that  it  would
    therefore  have  to  be  shown   that   there   was   unlawfulness   or
    irrationality.  There  was  clearly  nothing  unlawful,  irrational  or
    unreasonable in the respondent seeking to clarify matters  where  there
    were significant concerns about the  applicant's  application  and  his
    circumstances. The respondent was perfectly entitled  to  seek  further
    information on ETS matters by way  of  an  interview  and,  as  already
    stated,  to  undertake  investigations  into  the  genuineness  of  the
    sponsorship when  information  suggested  that  there  were  issues  of
    concern. As Mr Harland submitted, all the steps taken by the respondent
    which delayed the outcome of the applicant's application were  sensible
    and reasonable ones and the period of delay was, in any  event,  not  a
    significant one. I find  nothing  in  the  case  of  Suny,  R  (on  the
    application of) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019]
    EWCA  Civ  1019,  as  relied  upon  by  Mr  Karim,  to  undermine  that
    conclusion.

29. Also argued under the second ground of  substantive  unfairness  in  Mr
    Karim's skeleton argument, albeit not raised at the  hearing,  was  the
    apparent contradiction  in  the  refusal  decision  in  the  respondent
    claiming that the sponsor had contacted the Home Office on 25 July 2018
    stating that they  had  no  record  of  assigning  a  CoS  or  offering
    employment, but then stating that the application  was  refused  before
    that date on 5 July 2018. However it is clear from the Detailed Grounds
    of Defence and the GCID notes that  that  was  simply  a  typographical
    error and the date of contact by the sponsor was 25 June 2018  and  not
    25 July 2018. No doubt that is the reason why Mr Karm  did  not  pursue
    the matter before me.

30. The second ground pleaded by Mr Karim at the  hearing  related  to  the
    rejection of the applicant's administrative review application for non-
    payment of the fee, in the decision of 18 June 2019. His submission was
    that the administrative review was wrongly rejected as the evidence  in
    the bundle, at pages 39 to 49, showed that no fee was required and that
    the  decision  rejecting  the  administrative  review  was  accordingly
    unlawful and irrational. I agree with Mr Harland  that  that  challenge
    had not been made timeously, as there was  no  such  challenge  in  the
    original grounds of claim. However, even if it was, there is  no  merit
    in the arguments made. The documents referred to by Mr Karim  at  pages
    39, 40, 43, 44, 45 and 49 which made mention of no  fee  being  payable
    were generated as a result of the information inputted by the applicant
    and were clearly not instructions from the SSHD. The documents referred
    to by Mr Harland were, however, proper instructions from the  SSHD  and
    clearly showed that a fee was payable following the return of  the  fee
    paid for the previous, successful administrative review,  as  shown  at
    page 66 of the bundle. At page  A91,  the  GCID  notes  show  that  the
    applicant's representatives were emailed on 21 May 2019 to request  the
    fee. Further, at page 32  of  the  bundle,  the  administrative  review
    rejection decision of 18 June 2019 made it clear that the  requirements
    of paragraphs 34L to 34Y of the immigration rules  and  the  exemptions
    therein were not met, as the previous fee had been refunded,  and  that
    the fee was therefore payable. The applicant's failure to pay  the  fee
    was, therefore, a valid and proper reason for the administrative review
    request to be rejected and there was nothing unlawful, unreasonable  or
    irrational in the respondent's decision in that respect.

31. As for the  third  ground,  alleging  that  the  respondent's  decision
    unlawfully interfered with the applicant's Article 8 rights  and  those
    of his dependents, Mr Karim simply relied upon  his  skeleton  argument
    and other pleadings and had no response to Mr Harland's submission that
    the ground was not made out. I agree with Mr Harland that there  is  no
    merit in the ground. Not only had  the  applicants  not  made  a  human
    rights application, but there was nothing in the cases of Balajigari or
    Ahsan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 2009 which would apply to the  applicant's
    circumstances so as to justify treating his PBS application as a  human
    rights  claim.  In  any  event,  there  was  clearly  nothing  in   the
    applicant's circumstances or his private life  in  the  UK  that  would
    possibly give rise to an arguable case under Article 8.

32. For all of these reasons, I reject the assertion  that  the  respondent
    acted unfairly in refusing the applicant's application  by  failing  to
    notify him of the sponsor having surrendered their licence.  There  was
    no obligation or duty upon the respondent to  do  so  and  the  Supreme
    Court judgment in Pathan did not provide a basis for any such  duty  in
    the circumstances of the applicant's case. The respondent was  entitled
    to make  the  decision  that  she  did  and  there  was  no  procedural
    unfairness in the  procedure  by  which  she  made  her  decision.  The
    decision was, furthermore, a lawful, rational and reasonable one  which
    was in accordance with the immigration rules  and  the  relevant  legal
    framework.  The  applicant's  application  for   judicial   review   is
    accordingly refused.

    Costs

33. The applicant, being the losing party, bears  the  respondent's  costs.
    There is no merit in the submissions made by the applicant  that  those
    costs ought to be reduced by 50%: neither reason given by the applicant
    at [10] and [11] of the submissions justifies a reduction in the  costs
    to be paid. Accordingly, the  applicant  is  to  pay  the  respondent's
    reasonable costs of �8,468.66.
