                          DETERMINATION BY CONSENT


    Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

         Upon the determination in the First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  on
         17th April 2014 disclosing a material error of law  and  being  set
         aside on 9th October 2014.

         And  upon  the  parties  having  agreed  (in  accordance  with  the
         Statement of Agreed Facts of 3.3.15) that:

           i.  the  evidence  establishes  that  Mr  Premkumar  acquired  a
              Permanent  Right  of  Residence  in   accordance   with   The
              Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (as
              amended) on 30.4.2006, having been lawfully resident  in  the
              UK since at  least  2001  as  the  spouse  of  Ms  Thirumugal
              Mariathas, a Danish national exercising a Community  activity
              in the UK (irrespective of his marriage to  her  in  a  false
              identity)

          ii. Ms Sivakumar is entitled to succeed under paragraph  EX.1  of
              the Immigration Rules (as amended); and

         iii. Their daughter Nimiya Premkumar, (although not a party to the
              appeal) was born a British citizen in the UK on 30.9.2011

         It is ordered that:

         1.   The appeals be allowed.

         2.   Mr Premkumar is entitled to be issued with a residence permit.

         3.   Mrs Sivakumar is entitled to be granted leave to remain.

    The appeals in the Upper Tribunal are therefore allowed.  The  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for legal  error.   The  appeal
    against the decisions giving rise  to  the  appeal  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal are allowed.
