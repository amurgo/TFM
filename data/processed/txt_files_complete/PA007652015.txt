                 Secretary of State for the Home Department

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:     Not represented & no attendance
For the respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Robertson promulgated 13.5.16, who dismissed his  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent to refuse him entry clearance to
    the United Kingdom as ZZ.  The Judge heard the appeal on 15.4.16.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly granted permission to appeal on 8.6.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 19.7.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. There was no appearance by on behalf of the appellant. I was  satisfied
    that the requisite notice of hearing had been served by post on 27.6.16
    on the appellant at the correct address. He does not  have  any  listed
    representative. There is on file no  explanation  for  the  appellant's
    absence. In the circumstances, I found that  the  overriding  objective
    was best met in this case by proceeding  to  hear  the  case  as  I  am
    permitted to do by virtue of the Tribunal's procedure rules.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below, I found no error of law in the making of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision
    of Judge Robertson to be set aside.

 6. The grounds of application for permission to appeal complain  that  the
    incorrect standard of proof was  applied  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge and that the benefit of the doubt should be given to  the  asylum
    seeker.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Kelly  suggested  that  reading
    the decision as a whole fails to demonstrate that the judge applied the
    correct, lower, standard of  proof.  He  found  it  arguable  that  the
    decision may "give the impression that too high a standard of proof has
    been applied and that no account has been taken of  the  positive  role
    for doubt."

 8. I disagree. It is clear that in reading the decision as  a  whole  that
    Judge Robertson did apply the  correct  lower  standard  of  proof.  As
    pointed out in the Rule 24 reply of 29.6.16, at �12 the judge corrected
    stated that the burden is on  the  appellant  and  that  he  must  show
    'substantial grounds for believing' that he has  a  well-founded  fear.
    This is repeated at �13, �14, �22, and �25. In particular, at �22,  the
    judge stated that s/he was "not persuaded even on the low  standard  of
    proof applicable that the appellant was a credible witness."

 9. It follows that the judge applied the correct burden  and  standard  of
    proof. There is no merit in any of the  grounds  of  appeal,  they  are
    merely a disagreement with the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision.  I
    am satisfied that the conclusions reached were open to the judge on the
    evidence and for which cogent reasons have been provided. The  decision
    is neither perverse nor irrational.

Conclusions:

10. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
