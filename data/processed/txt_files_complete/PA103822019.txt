                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. On 21 June 2021 I wrote to the parties as follows:

         "In a  response  under  rule  24,  Mr  Tufan,  Senior  Home  Office
         Presenting Officer, has proposed, on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
         State, that this appeal  to  be  heard  afresh  in  the  First-tier
         Tribunal.

         The reason for that proposal, with which I  agree,  is  that  Judge
         Page applied the wrong standard of proof to  the  determination  of
         the appellant's nationality.

         I now propose, without more ado, to set aside Judge Page's decision
         for error of law and remit  the  appellant's  appeal  to  be  heard
         afresh by the First-tier Tribunal.

         Any submissions to the contrary  will  be  considered  if  received
         within 14 days of the date of this letter."

 2. No reply has been received.

 3. I now set aside the decision of Judge Page for error of law  and  remit
    the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for decision afresh.

                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL

                                                          Date: 22 July 2021
