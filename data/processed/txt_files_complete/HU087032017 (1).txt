For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals from the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge S Meah sitting at Taylor House on 16 August 2018) dismissing his
    appeal against the decision of an Entry Clearance Officer to refuse  to
    grant him entry clearance as the spouse of a person present and settled
    here on the ground that  his  exclusion  from  the  United  Kingdom  is
    mandated by Rule 320(11).  The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an
    anonymity direction, and I do not consider that the appellant  requires
    anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

Relevant Background Facts

 2. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, who was born on 15 March  1989.
    The appellant entered  the  UK  in  2005  with  his  mother  and  other
    siblings.  They all came on visit visas, and they all overstayed.   The
    appellant had a multiple visit visa which was valid from 2005 to  2015,
    and he admits to regularly travelling back and  forth  between  Nigeria
    and the UK between 2005 and 2008.  He completed his A levels in the UK,
    and then undertook a BA degree in Law, followed by a  Masters  in  Law.
    He returned to Nigeria in 2013, but came back again on the same  multi-
    visit visa in 2014.   It was at this point that he met his future  wife
    and sponsor.  He decided to overstay again in order  to  develop  their
    relationship.  They intended to get married in the  UK,  but  were  not
    able to do so due to the appellant's immigration  status.   Eventually,
    the appellant returned to Nigeria with his sponsor  in  February  2017,
    and they got married in Ibadan State in the same month.

 3. On 5 April 2017 the appellant applied for entry clearance as the spouse
    of his sponsor.  In his application form, he  made  (it  appears)  full
    disclosure of his adverse immigration history.

 4.  On  19  July  2017  an  Entry  Clearance   Officer   (post   reference
    SHEFO\441222)  gave  his   reasons   for   refusing   the   appellant's
    application.  He accepted that  the  appellant  met  all  the  relevant
    requirements of Appendix FM, including  the  suitability  requirements,
    the relationship  requirements,  the  financial  requirements  and  the
    English language requirement.  However,  his  application  was  refused
    under paragraph 320(11) of the Rules.

 5. The ECO's reasoning was that the Home Office records showed that he was
    issued with a 10-year visit visa valid from 18 July  2005  to  18  July
    2015.  The maximum duration permitted in the UK on any single  occasion
    was 6 months or 180 consecutive days.  He had said in  his  application
    form that, during the validity of this visa, he had made five trips  to
    the UK.

 6. His two most recent trips to the UK were from 22 July 2008 to 14 August
    2013 (5 years and 32 days),  and  then  from  24  February  2014  to  7
    February 2017 (2 years, 11 months and 14 days).  It had also been noted
    that, "during his most recent visits", he  had  undertaken  studies  at
    Kingston  University  and  at  King's  College  London.   He  had  thus
    undertaken studies at a time when his immigration status did not  allow
    him to do so.  In the light of his immigration  history,  the  ECO  was
    satisfied that he had contrived in a significant way to  frustrate  the
    intentions of the Rules by overstaying  and  breaching  the  conditions
    attached to his leave.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. At the hearing  before  Judge  Meah,  the  appellant  was  not  legally
    represented.  The  sponsor  appeared  on  his  behalf,  and  gave  oral
    evidence.

 8. In her subsequent decision, Judge Meah at paragraph  [33]  accepted  Ms
    Godfrey's submission that there were significant aggravating factors in
    the case and that therefore the  ECO  was  entirely  correct  to  apply
    paragraph 320(11).  But she also held that both the ECO and the ECM had
    omitted to mention  "the  aggravating  factors"  required  by  320(11).
    Nonetheless, she did not find this to be fatal in the light of what was
    stated in PS (Paragraph 320(11) discretion: care needed)  India  [2010]
    UKUT 440 (IAC).

 9. The Judge went on to find that there were number of aggravating factors
    which justified the appellant's exclusion under the Rule, none of which
    had been relied on by the ECO or ECM.

10. Firstly, she drew an adverse inference from the fact that the bundle of
    documents prepared for the  appeal  provided  no  details  of  how  the
    appellant had paid for his studies.  She found that this was probably a
    deliberate omission: the likelihood was that the appellant  had  sought
    to conceal the fact that either did not pay for any of his schooling in
    the UK, including for his A levels, or that, if he did pay for  any  of
    them, it was on home-fee terms.  Secondly, she found  the  evidence  of
    the appellant and the sponsor to  be  incredible  in  relation  to  the
    attempt to blame the appellant's mother for the decision to overstay in
    2005, when the appellant was aged 16.   Thirdly,  she  found  that  the
    appellant had exhibited a propensity to deceive by  repeatedly  abusing
    the visit visa he had in his possession in order to enter  the  UK  for
    the purpose of overstaying and to engage in studies which he would have
    known he was not entitled to undertake.  Fourthly,  she  did  not  find
    credible the claim that the mother had simply decided to overstay  with
    the appellant and the other children in 2005, as there was nothing from
    the mother to confirm what he and the sponsor were  now  claiming.  She
    found that it was likely to be deliberate effort to conceal  the  truth
    behind why the appellant had overstayed. Fifthly, at paragraph [38] the
    Judge held that the appellant would have deceived immigration officials
    at the port of entry when re-entering the UK  in  2008  and  2014.   He
    would not have been given leave to enter if the Immigration Service had
    been made aware of extensive periods of previous overstaying and breach
    of conditions.   Hence deception was practised on these occasions  when
    he sought re-entry into the UK.

The Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

11. The permission application was settled by Ms Moffat of Counsel.  Ground
    1 was that the Judge had failed to apply the correct burden  of  proof.
    At paragraph 11, the Judge stated that the burden of proof  is  on  the
    appellant, whereas the burden of proof rested with  the  respondent  to
    prove the facts relied upon as establishing that Rule 320(11) applied.

12. Ground 2 was that the Judge had failed properly to apply the two  stage
    test under Rule 320(11). While the Judge identified the requirement for
    aggravating circumstances in  addition  to  immigration  breaches,  the
    aggravating circumstances  which  she  identified  (namely  significant
    periods of overstaying and engaging in extensive studies in  breach  of
    conditions of leave as a visitor) only constituted immigration breaches
    as required by the first limb of the test.  The existence of more  than
    one  immigration  breach  was  not  identified  in  the  Rules  as   an
    aggravating  circumstance,  even  of  itself,  and  the   examples   of
    aggravating circumstances given in the second stage of the test do  not
    replicate the immigration breaches listed in  the  first  limb  of  the
    test.

13. It could not be a proper application of Rule 320(11)  to  rely  on  the
    same circumstances which give rise to findings on immigration  breaches
    under the first limb of the test in  order  to  find  additionally  the
    existence of aggravating circumstances under the second limb.

14. Ground 3 was that the Judge had  failed  to  take  into  account,  when
    considering proportionality under Article 8 ECHR, the ECO's failure  to
    identify aggravating circumstances.

The Reason for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

15. On 11 October  2018  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hollingworth  granted
    permission to  appeal  as  he  was  satisfied  that  the  grounds  were
    arguable.  In particular, it was arguable that the Judge had set out an
    insufficient review of the standard and burden of proof.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

16. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Ms Moffat developed the grounds of appeal. After hearing  from  Mr
    Bramble, I indicated that I was minded to find that the decision should
    be set aside as being erroneous in law.  There was a further discussion
    about future disposal.  Ms Moffat invited me to remake  the  appeal  in
    the appellant's favour on the ground that the ECO''s decision  was  not
    in accordance with the law,  and  hence  disproportionate.  Mr  Bramble
    submitted that it would be wrong to allow the appeal outright,  without
    there being a further hearing to reconsider the appeal on  its  merits.
    In reply, Ms Moffat confirmed that  what  she  envisaged  was  the  ECO
    having the opportunity  to  reconsider  his  decision  to  refuse.  She
    submitted that his current decision  was  unlawful,  and  so  a  lawful
    decision was awaited. She was not asking me to direct the ECO to  grant
    the appellant entry clearance - only that the ECO should reconsider the
    application in accordance with the guidance given in PS (India).

The Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

17. Ground 1 is that the Judge incorrectly applied  the  burden  of  proof.
    This ground is made out because the Judge failed to direct herself that
    the burden of proof rests with the respondent to make out a case  under
    Rule 320(11), not on the appellant to rebut such a case.   The  Judge's
    misdirection as to where the burden of proof lay had a material bearing
    on her fact-finding exercise, because the Judge made  adverse  findings
    of fact based upon a failure by the  appellant  to  produce  supporting
    evidence for matters which were not raised  in  the  refusal  decision.
    For example, it was not part of the  ECO's  case  that  an  aggravating
    circumstance was the appellant accessing publicly-funded, as opposed to
    privately-funded, education.  It was not also not the ECO's  case  that
    an aggravating circumstance was  the  appellant  deciding  of  his  own
    motion to overstay in 2005, or to embark on studying for A  levels.  On
    the contrary, the ECO was astute not  to  hold  against  the  appellant
    immigration breaches committed when he was still a  minor.   A  careful
    reading of the ECO's decision reveals that the ECO only sought to apply
    Rule 320(11) to the appellant's conduct after he had reached his age of
    majority. Thus, the Judge wrongly drew adverse inferences from  a  lack
    of evidence to show that the appellant's studies were privately funded;
    or to show that, when initially overstaying as a minor,  the  appellant
    was acting under the direction and control of his mother.

18. Ground 2 is also made out, as the two matters relied on in the  refusal
    notice are both types of immigration breaches that are  listed  in  the
    first limb of Rules 320(11).  Neither of  these  types  of  immigration
    breach features in the list of "other aggravating circumstances"  which
    appears in the second limb. The structure of Rule 320 (11) is that  the
    applicant  has  contrived  in  a  significant  way  to  frustrate   the
    intentions of the  Rules  by  (i)  overstaying;  or  (ii)  breaching  a
    condition attached to his leave; or (iii) being an illegal entrant:  or
    (iv) using deception in an application or in order to obtain  documents
    to  support  an  application;   and   there   are   other   aggravating
    circumstances,  such  as  absconding,  using  an  assumed  identity  or
    multiple identities, and switching nationality.

19. While, as Ms Moffat acknowledges, the list in the second  limb  is  not
    exhaustive, the way in which the Rule is constructed means that  it  is
    not open to the ECO  to  find  that  the  Rule  is  engaged  simply  by
    aggregating two of the different types of immigration breach which  are
    listed in the first limb. The ECO must identify  at  least  one  "other
    aggravating circumstance" which legitimately comes within the scope  of
    the second limb.

20. Having found that the ECO had failed to identify  at  least  one  other
    aggravating circumstance in the second limb - as the Rule requires - it
    was not open to Judge Meah to attempt to cure the  inherent  defect  in
    the decision notice by seeking to  extract  from  the  evidence  "other
    aggravating circumstances" which the ECO had not relied on  or  by  re-
    assigning one of the immigration breaches in the first  limb  to  being
    another  aggravating  circumstance  in  the  second  limb.   This   was
    procedurally unfair, particularly as  the  appellant  was  not  legally
    represented.  Of particular concern is the  Judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant used deception when re-entering the UK on his multiple  visit
    visa. This was a matter of complete speculation.   It  all  depends  on
    whether he was asked questions on arrival at port, or  whether  he  was
    simply waved through.

21. In conclusion, while it is clearly open to the Judge to find  that  the
    first limb of 320(11) was met on the basis of the  admissions  made  by
    the appellant in his application form, the finding that both  limbs  of
    Rule 320(11) were made out was vitiated by a material error of law  for
    the reasons given above.

The Remaking of the Decision

22. It is unnecessary to conduct a further hearing for the purposes of  the
    remaking of the decision.  Not only is it unnecessary, but it would  be
    futile, as the decision of the ECO is so fundamentally flawed that  the
    only just outcome  is  for  the  ECO  to  reconsider  the  exercise  of
    discretion under 320(11) afresh, in accordance with the guidance  given
    by the Tribunal in PS (Paragraph 320(11) discretion: care needed) India
    [2010] UKUT 440 (IAC), where the following was said in the head note:

         The exercise of discretion under paragraph  320(11)  of  HC395,  as
         amended, to refuse an application for entry  clearance  in  a  case
         where the automatic prohibition on the grant of entry clearance  at
         paragraph  320(7B)  is  disapplied  by  paragraph  320(7)(c),   the
         decision-maker  must  exercise  great   care   in   assessing   the
         aggravating circumstances said to justify  refusal  and  must  have
         regard to the public interest in encouraging  those  unlawfully  in
         the United Kingdom to leave and seek to regularise their status  by
         an application for entry clearance

23. The ECO did not exercise the necessary care  in  assessing  aggravating
    circumstances.   As  found  by  Judge  Meah,  the  ECO  identified  two
    different types of immigration breach which feature in the  first  limb
    of the test.; but the ECO  did  not  identify  "the  other  aggravating
    circumstances" which must also be present in order for the Rule  to  be
    engaged. There is  no  cross-appeal  by  the  respondent  against  this
    finding by Judge Meah.

24. Since some time has elapsed since the refusal decision, it is pertinent
    to reflect on the  public  interest  consideration  illuminated  in  PS
    (India). At paragraph [14], the Tribunal held that the ECO should  have
    specifically recognised that Mr S voluntarily left the UK more than  12
    months ago with a view to regularising his immigration status:

         There was no question that the marriage was a genuine one.  If  the
         aggravating circumstances are not truly aggravating,  there  is  in
         this context a serious risk that those in a position of Mr  S  will
         simply continue to remain in the UK unlawfully and will not seek to
         regularise their status as he has sought to do.  The effect then is
         likely to be counterproductive  to  the  general  purposes  of  the
         relevant Rules and to the  maintenance  of  a  coherent  system  of
         immigration.

25. As the appellant applied for entry clearance within  a  few  months  of
    leaving the UK voluntarily, he was at the  time  of  decision  on  weak
    ground on this aspect of  the  public  interest.   However,  his  human
    rights claim must now be assessed as at the date of the hearing in  the
    Upper Tribunal, and not as at the date of decision.   Accordingly,  the
    appellant is on much stronger ground now with  respect  to  the  public
    interest consideration illuminated in PS (India), as he has now  served
    a period of exclusion from the UK of some 18 months.

26. For the above reasons, the appellant has shown  that  the  decision  is
    unlawful under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted:

The appellant's appeal is  allowed  on  the  ground  that  the  decision  is
unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

I make no anonymity direction.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed this appeal, I have given consideration as to  whether  to
make a fee award in respect of any fee which has been paid  or  is  payable,
and I have decided to make a fee award  of  �80  as  the  decision  appealed
against was legally flawed.
