Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr K Smyth, Solicitor at Kesar and Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This matter  comes  before  me  pursuant  to  permission  having  been
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Coker dated 23rd November  2015.   That
    grant of permission itself was an enhancement of the permission granted
    by the First-tier Tribunal  itself  in  respect  of  other  grounds  of
    appeal. Therefore the Appellant had been granted permission  to  appeal
    on all grounds.   The  appeal  relates  to  a  decision  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge O'Garro  promulgated  on  7  October  2015.   The  Judge
    dismissed the appeal on all grounds including on protection grounds.

2.    The Appellant's claim is in respect of  a  risk  on  return  from  the
    Taliban or from a local businessman there  called  H.  The  grounds  of
    appeal can be summarised as follows:
    1) The conclusions on credibility were unsupported by earlier findings.
       That is because in the earlier part of her decision  the  Judge  had
       accepted that the Appellant's brother was killed in a suicide attack
       was  a  credible  fact  whereas  the  Judge  later  said  that   the
       Appellant's claim was an entire fabrication;
    2) The incorrect standard of proof  was  applied.  When  assessing  the
       Appellant's age the civil standard was applied instead of the  lower
       standard of proof applicable in asylum claims;
    3) There was an incorrect statement in respect of the burden of  proof.
       The Judge should have asked herself whether there was  a  reasonable
       degree of likelihood that the Appellant will not be able to  reunite
       with his family in Afghanistan;
    4) There was an inadequate consideration of entitlement to humanitarian
       protection. The Judge did not make adequate findings and had devoted
       only a single sentence of her judgment to this.


3.    At the hearing before me the  parties  had  indicated  that  they  had
    reached a joint position. Although not within the Tribunal's file I was
    told that there was a subsequent Rule  24  Reply  from  the  Respondent
    dated 22 December 2015. In that Reply the Respondent had said that  the
    Appellant's application for permission to appeal was not being opposed.



4.    Ms Fijiwala confirmed that her  submission  was  that  the  appeal  be
    allowed. She submitted further that the matter be remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal for a rehearing.

5.    Mr Smyth said that he agreed that the matter ought to be  remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.

6.    Accordingly it is clear that the Judge's decision involved the  making
    of a material error of law. That decision is set aside and there  shall
    be a rehearing at the First-tier Tribunal. None of the findings made by
    the Judge shall remain.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First tier Tribunal  Judge  involved  the  making  of  a
material error of law and is set aside.

There shall be a rehearing at the First-tier Tribunal

An anonymity direction is made.
