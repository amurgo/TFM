Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
No anonymity order was made by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I  find  that  no
particular issues arise on the facts of this case  that  give  rise  to  the
need for a direction. For this reason no anonymity direction is made.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

    1. The Appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka.  She  appeals  against  the
       Respondent's decision dated 30 September 2014 refusing  her  further
       leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and directing her removal from  the
       UK.


    2. The Appellant's appeal was dismissed by  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Kelly in a decision promulgated on 29 April 2015 ("the Decision") on
       the basis that:-
        a. She had not demonstrated that she and her business  partner  had
           available funds of not less than �50,000 ("issue one")
        b. She could not meet the requirements of  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)
           relating to evidence of marketing and trading ("issue two")
        c. She could not meet the maintenance requirements of paragraph  1A
           of Appendix C ("issue three")


    3. Permission was granted by First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Shimmin  on  25
       June 2015 on the basis that it was arguable that the Judge had  used
       the incorrect date for the relevant bank statements and  had  failed
       to consider paragraph 245AA of the Rules.   He  also  permitted  the
       Appellant to argue her other grounds even though he considered  them
       to be less meritorious. The matter comes before the  Upper  Tribunal
       to determine whether the First-tier Tribunal decision  involved  the
       making of an error of law.


       Submissions


    4. Mr Kannangara prefaced his submissions by saying that at the date of
       hearing before the First-Tier Tribunal, the Home  Office  Presenting
       Officer did not have all of  the  documents  which  accompanied  the
       application on  her  file.   His  submission  before  the  Judge  is
       recorded at [12].   He  submitted  that  this  must  be  so  as  the
       documents recorded as being on the Respondent's file at [9] did  not
       include mandatory documents (see paragraph 7  of  the  grounds)  and
       there had been no refusal on the basis of the Appellant's failure to
       produce those.  The Appellant had mistakenly said in  evidence  that
       she had submitted an invoice from Vistaprint in relation to business
       cards which could not have been supplied as the  printout  (although
       not the invoice itself) post-dated the application.  The  Judge  had
       held that against her in rejecting at [17] her evidence in  relation
       to what documents were supplied as "not reliable".


    5. In relation to issue one, Mr Kannangara submitted that the Judge had
       erred in dismissing the appeal on the basis that the Appellant could
       not show that she had did not have access to  the  �50,000  required
       for the purposes of paragraph 245DD in accordance with Table 4(d)(v)
       of Appendix A.  Her case is that she had  invested  �4344  of  funds
       from the business into a car.  At paragraph [18]  of  the  Decision,
       the Judge found that she  had  not  produced  any  evidence  of  the
       investment because  an  invoice  evidencing  the  purchase  was  not
       referred to in the application form.

    6. Mr Kannangara submitted that, although it was the  Appellant's  case
       that  the  invoice  was  with   the   documents   accompanying   the
       application, the specified document to evidence the  investment  was
       the accounts.  She had completed the sixth column in the  Table  3a1
       at page 30 of the application to say that she was providing the "un-
       audited accounts" to evidence this (in accordance with paragraph 46-
       SD(a) of Appendix A to the Rules).  I was shown the accounts  relied
       on at pages 7-13 of the Appellant's bundle.  This was referred to as
       "the Appellant's accountant's report for  period  ending  30th  June
       2014" at paragraph 10 of the  Decision.   I  pointed  out  that  the
       evidence which the Appellant gave to  the  Judge  was  at  [11]  and
       clearly stated when she was asked what evidence was provided of  the
       purchase  that  she  "provided  the  relevant   invoice   with   her
       application".  In response, Mr Kannangara pointed to paragraph 6  of
       the Appellant's statement at page 1 of her bundle which stated  that
       she had submitted both the invoice and the accountant's report.

    7. On that basis, Mr Kannangara submitted that the Judge had  erred  in
       law in failing to make a finding whether the accountant's report was
       submitted and, since that could only be in  the  Appellant's  favour
       since it was referred to in the application form,  in  finding  that
       this was the specified evidence that she had invested �4344  in  the
       business.  She was therefore only required to have  the  balance  of
       �50,000 in available funds.  The Respondent had  not  disputed  that
       the amounts held in the Sri Lanka savings bank  would  make  up  the
       remainder.  The Judge noted at [11] the funds available amounted  to
       �48,894.57. The Respondent's refusal in relation to this  issue  was
       based only on a lack of evidence of the investment and  the  refusal
       letter had failed to consider the accountant's report.


    8. Issue two concerns the specified documents required to show that the
       business was  actively  trading.   Since  the  Appellant  had  leave
       previously as a Tier 1 Post Study Work  Migrant,  she  had  to  show
       under Table 4(d)(iv) of Appendix A that since 11 July 2014 and up to
       the date of the application she was continuously engaged in relevant
       business  activity.  This  had  to  be  demonstrated  by   documents
       specified at  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)  in  the  form  of  specified
       advertising and marketing material and (iv) in the form of contracts
       for service  or  bank  account  documents.  The  Judge  accepted  at
       paragraph [23] that the contract with Senara Ltd met  the  specified
       document requirement under (iv) because it was dated 3 January  2014
       with a start date of 3  January  2014  (before  11  July  2014)  and
       related to a continuous period to 6 January 2015. However, the Judge
       did not accept  that  there  was  specified  evidence  to  meet  41-
       SD(e)(iii).  This is dealt with at paragraph [22].

    9. Mr Kannangara submitted that the fact that the business was actively
       trading was established by the contract and the Judge's  finding  at
       [23] that there was a contract running from January 2014 to  January
       2015.  There was also evidence that the company had been  formed  in
       October 2013.  The Appellant only had  to  show  that  there  was  a
       business which had started before 11 July 2014 and was continuing to
       the date of the application.  In relation  to  marketing  materials,
       the Appellant sent screenshots of the website dated 19 and  20  July
       2014.  She also  sent  business  cards  which  she  had  printed  in
       November 2013 (although it was accepted that she had  not  submitted
       the invoice to show when they were printed).  She had also  sent  an
       invoice in relation to the purchase of a domain name and  a  hosting
       package dated 27 October 2013.  Mr Kannangara submitted that on  the
       basis of that evidence coupled with the  contract  which  the  Judge
       accepted as showing the business was trading  as  at  January  2014,
       there was evidence  to  satisfy  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii).   In  the
       alternative,  the   Respondent   should   have   applied   paragraph
       245AA(d)(iii) of the Rules on the basis that the missing information
       was verifiable from other documents with the application.


   10. In relation to issue three, Mr Kannangara submitted that  the  Judge
       had, at [24] erred in finding that because  the  Sri  Lanka  Savings
       Bank was dated 24 July 2014,  it could not show that the  amount  in
       that account could supplement any shortfall  in  the  Barclays  Bank
       account for the relevant period.  The letter of 24 July 2014  showed
       that the money was available from 3 October 2013 to 3  October  2014
       and therefore satisfied the requirements in the Rules.


   11. Mr Bramble in reply fairly accepted that  the  Judge  had  erred  in
       relation to issue three as the letter from  the  Sri  Lanka  Savings
       Bank did show that the funds were available from 3 October 2013 to 3
       October 2014.  He submitted however that this was  not  material  as
       the Appellant had failed in relation to other requirements.  He made
       the same submission in relation to paragraph  245AA  of  the  Rules.
       The requirement for  "evidential  flexibility"  applied  only  where
       addressing the error would make  a  difference  and  not  where  the
       application would be refused for other reasons.


   12. In relation to issue two, Mr Bramble submitted that  the  Judge  had
       not erred.  The requirements in  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)  and  (iv)
       were cumulative not alternatives.  Although the Judge  had  accepted
       that the contract met the  requirements  of  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iv)
       therefore this did not affect her findings in relation to  paragraph
       41-SD(e)(iii) the requirements of which were not met.  The  findings
       were clearly set out at [22] and the Judge  was  entitled  to  reach
       those findings on the evidence which she found had  been  submitted.
       The invoice from Vistaprint was not with  the  application  and  the
       Judge was right to disregard it.


   13. In relation to issue one, Mr Bramble pointed out that the investment
       of funds was in fact �3344 not �4344 because a car belonging to  the
       Appellant's business partner had been traded in as part payment (see
       [15] of the Decision). Mr Bramble also pointed out that it  was  not
       shown in the accountant's report as an investment of funds into  the
       business but only as a tangible asset.


   14. In reply, on issue three, Mr Kannangara submitted that the  evidence
       submitted  did  meet  the  requirement  of  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)
       because it showed a  website  which  had  been  set  up  within  the
       previous 3 months and an invoice which showed that the  website  and
       hosting package had been  purchased  in  October  2013  as  well  as
       advertising material in the form of business cards.


   15. I reserved my decision in relation to whether the Judge had made  an
       error of law.  I asked Mr Bramble whether, if I found  an  error  of
       law, he was asking me  to   remit  to  the  Secretary  of  State  to
       consider Paragraph 245AA.  He indicated that  he  did  not  consider
       that was necessary as Paragraph 245AA had  been  considered  in  the
       reasons for refusal letter but not applied but he had  no  objection
       to that course if  I  considered  that  it  was  necessary  for  the
       Secretary of State to take into account documents which had not been
       considered.  Mr Kannangara indicated that he  did  not  consider  it
       necessary for any further evidence to be given and was  content  for
       me to re-make the Decision based on the material before me.  He  did
       not have any objection to remittal to the Secretary of  State  based
       on a need to consider paragraph 245AA if that arose on the basis  of
       my decision.


       Decision and reasons


   16. After having considered the grounds of appeal and oral  arguments  I
       am satisfied that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Decision  involved  the
       making of an error of law in relation to issue three. However,  that
       is not material since I am not satisfied that the Decision  involved
       the making of an error of law in relation to  issues  one  and  two.
       The outcome of the appeal would therefore be the same and I  do  not
       therefore set aside the Decision. I set out my reasons below.


   17. The Judge clearly erred in finding  that  the  Appellant  could  not
       satisfy the maintenance requirements on the basis that the Sri Lanka
       Savings Account letter was dated 24 July 2014.  That clearly  showed
       that the Appellant had the funds in that account  available  to  her
       from October 2013 to  October  2014  and  was  therefore  sufficient
       evidence that the Appellant met the requirements of  Appendix  C  to
       the Rules in relation to maintenance.


   18. In relation to issue one, I am prepared to accept that the Appellant
       did submit the accountant's report which  is  noted  as  being  "un-
       audited accounts" in the application form  (see  [6]  above)  and  I
       accept that the Judge failed to mention that at  [18]  when  dealing
       with the investment of �4344.  However,  even  if  the  accountant's
       report could satisfy paragraph 46-SD(a)(ii) of  Appendix  A  to  the
       Rules (the accountant's credentials are not clear), it does not show
       the investment of the funds.  The car is shown only  as  a  tangible
       asset and there is no evidence in the  accounts  of  the  investment
       having been made.   Of  course,  the  invoice  in  relation  to  the
       purchase of the car could have supplemented the  report  to  provide
       that evidence but the Judge, who heard evidence from the  Appellant,
       was entitled to find that the invoice was  not  submitted  with  the
       application form and certainly it does not appear on the face of any
       of the documents that it was.  The Appellant cannot  therefore  meet
       the requirements of Table 4(d)(v) of Appendix A  to  the  Rules  and
       there is no error of law in the Decision in that regard.


   19. In  relation  to  issue  two,  the  requirements  of  paragraph  41-
       SD(e)(iii) are clear and are in addition to those at  paragraph  41-
       SD(e)(iv).  Notwithstanding the acceptance by  the  Judge  that  the
       contract met the requirements of paragraph  41-SD(e)(iv)  therefore,
       she was still required to consider whether the  other  material  met
       the requirements of paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii).  I can find no error in
       the reasoning at [22] of the Decision nor any error in  the  finding
       that on the basis of that reasoning the Appellant had not  satisfied
       paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii) of Appendix A to the Rules.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal Decision did involve the making of  an  error  on  a
point of law in relation to the issue of maintenance.   That  error  is  not
however material as the Appellant's appeal failed on other issues and  there
is no error of law in the Decision in that regard.

I therefore do not set aside the Decision

Upper                 Tribunal                  Judge                  Smith
   Date: 12 August 2015
