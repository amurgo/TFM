Appellant



and



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Respondent





	DECISION AND REASONS

	

Introduction

The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 13 December 1983. He made an application to the Secretary of State for an EEA residence card.  The application was refused in a decision dated 15 July 2016, for reasons that I need not set out herein.  

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

The appellant lodged an appeal before the First-tier Tribunal. That appeal came before FtT Judge Cohen, who concluded in a decision sent on 14 August 2017, that the First-tier Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to determine the appeal. No findings were made in relation to the substance of the appeal. The Judge’s conclusion was informed by the guidance given by this Tribunal in Sala [2016] UKUT 00411.  

The appellant appealed such decision to the Upper Tribunal and FtT Judge Keith granted permission in a decision sent on 16 February 2018. Thus, the matter comes before me.  





Discussion

The Court of Appeal has now given consideration to the very issue in play in the instant case – see Khan v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755. The Court concluded that the Upper Tribunal had been wrong in its conclusion and rationale in Sala.  It is not in dispute that the effect of the decision in Khan, if applied to this case, is that the First-tier Tribunal was wrong to conclude that it did not have jurisdiction in this appeal. 

For this reason, I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the appeal back to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh. 



Decision 



The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. 



The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.
