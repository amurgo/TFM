                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Nadine Finch), sitting at Taylor House on 17 May  2013,
    to  an EEA appeal by the holder of a Latvian alien's passport, born  21
    May 1976: this is a type of  document  issued  to  persons  of  Russian
    origin who have been living in the Baltic states since they  were  part
    of the Soviet Union, but who are not  regarded  as  citizens  by  those
    states' authorities, so are not EEA citizens either. It  is  not  clear
    that the appellant's daughter (the  sponsor)  has  any  other  kind  of
    citizenship herself; but the present application  seems  to  have  been
    dealt with by the Home Office on the basis that she was an EEA  citizen
    from Latvia.

 2. The only point the Home Office took when they refused the  appellant  a
    residence card as the sponsor's family member was that the sponsor  had
    failed to provide evidence that she was a 'qualified person', in  terms
    of reg. 6 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006
    [the EEA Regulations]. As they failed to  field  a  presenting  officer
    before the judge, she cannot in any way be blamed for dealing with  the
    case on the basis that this was the only issue before her. However  the
    Home Office then noticed the following provisions of reg. 7

        (1)   Subject  to  paragraph  (2),  for  the  purposes   of   these
           Regulations the following persons shall be treated as the family
           members of another person-
        (c) dependent direct relatives in his ascending line or that of his
           spouse or his civil partner;

 3. The Home Office grounds of appeal pointed out that the  judge  had  not
    dealt with the dependency requirement for relatives  in  the  ascending
    line, such as this appellant: they might reasonably have been  expected
    to take the blame for the writer  of  the  refusal  letter  not  having
    noticed it in the first place, but did not. The  fact  remains,  as  Mr
    Talacchi realistically acknowledged, that  this  country  is  under  no
    Treaty obligation  to  provide  a  residence  card  for  the  ascending
    relative of the sponsor (supposing he herself is an EEA citizen in  the
    first place), unless she can show she is dependent on her.

 4. Mr Talacchi recognized that for this reason the judge's decision  could
    not stand; but he asked me to direct a fresh hearing, so that it  could
    be re-made, dealing with the issue of dependency which had now  arisen.
    I referred him to the evidence recorded by the judge at paragraph 9: by
    the date of the hearing the sponsor had left her previous job with  TTC
    Homecare, and was "... working for  two  different  clients  for  three
    hours a week as a housekeeper and earned ï¿½160 per month".

 5. Mr Talacchi referred to the appellant's having been  living  here  with
    the sponsor for some time; but it is not easy to see how those earnings
    could have supported one  person  to  any  standard  accepted  in  this
    country, let alone two. In my  view  the  judge  would  not  have  been
    entitled to make a finding of dependency on the  evidence  before  her,
    with the result shown below. If the position has changed since then, it
    will be open to the appellant to make a fresh application to  the  Home
    Office, with full evidence of any current dependency.
