For the Appellant:     In Person
For the Respondent:    Mr. I Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of Chile  and  is  presently  aged  56.  He
    appeals  a  decision  of  the  respondent  to   refuse   human   rights
    representations made in relation to  a  decision  to  deport  him.  The
    decision is dated 16 January 2018.

 2.  The  proceedings  in  this  matter  have  an  extensive  history.  The
    appellant's appeal was initially allowed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (JFtT Paul) by a decision dated 13  August  2018.  The  respondent  was
    granted permission to appeal to this Tribunal and the decision of  JFtT
    Paul was set aside by a decision dated 15 November 2018 (UTJJ Finch and
    Plimmer). The matter was remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  and  the
    appellant's appeal was allowed by a decision of JFtT  Cockril  dated  3
    July 2019. The respondent was granted permission to appeal, and  I  set
    aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal on 11 September  2019.  I
    directed that the decision in this matter be remade by this Tribunal.

Hearing

 3. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
    held during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing  room  at
    Field House. The hearing room and the building were open to the public.
    The hearing and its start time were listed in the  cause  list.  I  was
    addressed by the appellant and Mr. Jarvis in exactly the same way as if
    we were together in the hearing room. The appellant's wife  also  spoke
    to me. I am satisfied: that this constituted a hearing in  open  court;
    that the open justice principle has been secured;  that  no  party  has
    been prejudiced; and that, insofar as there has been any restriction on
    a right or interest, it is justified as necessary and proportionate.

Anonymity

 4. No anonymity direction has been  issued  to  date  in  this  matter.  I
    addressed the issue of anonymity at  the  hearing,  consequent  to  the
    filing of medical evidence concerning the appellant's wife and  two  of
    their children.

 5. I am mindful of Guidance Note 2013 No 1 concerned with the  issuing  of
    an anonymity direction and  I  observe  that  the  starting  point  for
    consideration of  such  a  direction  in  this  Chamber  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal, as  in  all  courts  and  tribunals,  is  open  justice.  The
    principle of open  justice  is  fundamental  to  the  common  law.  The
    rationale for this is to protect the rights of the parties and also  to
    maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. Revelation
    of the identity of the parties is an important part  of  open  justice:
    Re: Guardian News & Media Ltd [2010] UKSC 1; [2010] 2 AC 697.

 6. The appellant's circumstances are not, alone, such as  to  justify  the
    overriding of article 10 rights. He has committed  a  serious  criminal
    offence which is a matter of public record. I further observe that  the
    decision of this Tribunal (UTJJ Finch and Plimmer) has been  placed  on
    the Tribunal's website and no anonymity  direction  was  made  in  that
    matter.

 7. I note that the children in this matter are adults.  Being  mindful  of
    their  medical  conditions,  and  the  personal  circumstances  of  the
    appellant's wife, I am satisfied that respective article 8 and  article
    10 rights can be proportionately balanced by their not being  named  in
    this decision and no detail being given to the area of the  country  in
    which they reside. Such steps are appropriate in circumstances where it
    is in the public interest that this Tribunal provides reasons as to its
    consideration of a deportation appeal.

Background

 8. The appellant asserts that he first entered this country  in  1975,  in
    the company of his  mother,  brother  and  sister,  when  aged  11.  He
    returned to Chile in 1983 and some sixteen months later travelled  back
    to the United Kingdom. He was granted indefinite  leave  to  remain  in
    November 1984.

 9. The appellant has been married to a British citizen since 1983 and they
    have three adult children, all of whom are British citizens.

10. The appellant led a law-abiding  life  until  undertaking  events  that
    resulted in his pleading guilty at Blackfriars Crown Court on 12 August
    2014 to one count of fraud by abuse of position  which  involved  theft
    from an employer, amounting to �82,000.  He was sentenced on  13  April
    2015 to a custodial term of sixteen months.

11. In sentencing the appellant, HHJ Peter Clarke QC remarked, inter alia:

         'I accept that you were,  and  I  do  not  mean  this  in  any  way
         disparagingly, simply a bookkeeper. You were not the accountant  or
         the auditor of that firm, but you betrayed the trust  that  he  had
         placed in you. You did not do so for several years which only in  a
         way heightens the  fact  that  you  lost  employment  where  people
         trusted you with large sums of money.


         ... I do accept that there is no  evidence  of  you  spending  that
         money on luxuries, and I accept that you are and have been for some
         while the breadwinner for your family, one of your  children  being
         mentally disadvantaged.'

12. Following conviction, the respondent served the appellant with a notice
    of decision to make a  deportation  order  dated  21  April  2015.  The
    appellant submitted human rights representations.

13. On 26 January 2016 the appellant was  made  subject  to  a  deportation
    order and subsequently served with a decision giving  reasons  for  his
    deportation. The appellant enjoyed out-of-country appeal rights.

14. On 4 July 2017 Blackfriars Crown Court imposed a custodial term of  913
    days upon the appellant for non-payment of a confiscation order in  the
    sum of �100,000.

15. The appellant states that he subsequently sold the family home to  meet
    the requirements of the confiscation order.

16. The respondent served a new deportation decision  on  16  January  2018
    refusing his human rights claim but affording him an  in-country  right
    of appeal.

Decision

17. This is a matter where the respondent has properly sought to defend her
    decision over the  course  of  several  hearings.  In  accordance  with
    directions, the appellant  filed  further  evidence  focused  upon  the
    health of his wife, one of his two sons and  his  daughter.  These  two
    children currently reside at  the  family  home.  A  second  son  lives
    elsewhere in the country with his  own  family.  Upon  considering  the
    evidence now filed, and following questioning of the appellant  at  the
    hearing, Mr. Jarvis confirmed on behalf of the respondent  that  it  is
    now accepted that the appellant  meets  the  exception  to  deportation
    established by section 117C(3)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 ('the 2002 Act') and so his appeal should  be  allowed.
    The approach adopted  is  consistent  with  observations  made  by  the
    respondent  at  a  previous  adjourned  hearing  as  to  the  issue  of
    proportionality if the appellant were to file relevant further  medical
    evidence.

18. Section 117A(1) of the 2002 Act is  applicable  when  the  Tribunal  is
    required to determine whether a  decision  to  deport  made  under  the
    Immigration Acts disproportionately interferes with a person's right to
    respect for private and family life under article 8  and  as  a  result
    would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Section
    117A(2) confirms that in considering the public interest  question  the
    Tribunal must have particular regard in all cases to the considerations
    listed in section 117B and  in  cases  concerning  the  deportation  of
    foreign criminals to the considerations listed in section 117C  of  the
    2002 Act.

19. Section 117C(1) confirms that the deportation of foreign  criminals  is
    in the public interest. Laws LJ noted in SS (Nigeria) v.  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 550, [2014] 1 W.L.R. 998,
    at [54]:

         54. ... The pressing nature of the public interest here is  vividly
            informed by the fact that by  Parliament's  express  declaration
            the public interest is injured if the criminal's deportation  is
            not effected. Such  a  result  could  in  my  judgment  only  be
            justified by a very strong claim indeed.

20.  Parliament  has  provided  exceptions  to  the  public   interest   in
    deportation by means of section 117C(3) to (5) of the 2002 Act. Section
    117C(3) and (5) provide:

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
            sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
            public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception  1  or
            Exception 2 applies.


         ...


         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
            relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
            subsisting parental relationship with a  qualifying  child,  and
            the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child  would  be
            unduly harsh.'

21. Mr. Jarvis appropriately conceded that it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
    expect the appellant's wife to relocate to Chile with her husband.  The
    medical evidence clearly establishes that she is in poor health. Though
    she does not provide full-time care for her son who  resides  at  home,
    who  has  Asperger's  Syndrome,  the  evidence  before   the   Tribunal
    establishes that she provides significant care.  I  am  also  satisfied
    that the evidence identifies that there would be  significant  concerns
    as to the daughter's mental health if her mother  were  to  depart  the
    family home and relocate to Chile.

22.  The  question  before  this  Tribunal  is  therefore  one  as  to  the
    proportionality of separating  the  appellant  and  his  wife.  Section
    117C(5) of the 2002 Act confirms that an unduly harsh  test  is  to  be
    applied. In KB (Jamaica) v. Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2020] EWCA Civ 1385 the Court of Appeal  confirmed  that  this  is  an
    elevated  test  carrying   a   much   stronger   emphasis   than   mere
    undesirability  of  what  is  merely  uncomfortable,  inconvenient   or
    difficult; but the threshold is not as high  as  the  'very  compelling
    circumstances'  test  in  s.117C(6).  In  so  concluding,   the   Court
    recognised the approach adopted towards the unduly harsh  test  by  the
    Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria)  v.  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2018] UKSC 53, [2018] 1 W.L.R. 5273, at [27], and the Court
    of Appeal in HA (Iraq) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2020] EWCA Civ 1176, [2020] I.N.L.R. 639, at [56] - [52].

23. Mr. Jarvis confirmed that for the  purpose  of  both  the  respondent's
    considerations  in  this  matter,  and  the  Tribunal's,  weight  could
    properly be placed upon the behaviour of  the  appellant's  wife  at  a
    previous hearing where it was apparent to all present  in  the  hearing
    room that she was labouring under significant and adverse mental health
    concerns. It  was  apparent  to  me,  and  expressly  observed  by  the
    presenting officer attending, that the appellant's wife was  exhibiting
    unhealthy heightened anxiety akin to a breakdown. Her description as to
    her personal feelings in respect  of  the  proceedings  themselves  and
    possible separation from her husband identified clear  concerns  as  to
    her mental health. Soon after the hearing she was hospitalised.

24. Mr. Jarvis observed that there are a constellation  of  different,  but
    relevant, factors in this matter, ranging from the concerns of  two  of
    the non-qualifying children, who  have  attendant  care  and  emotional
    mental health needs, and the health concerns of the  appellant's  wife.
    Upon considering the totality  of  the  evidence  now  filed  with  the
    Tribunal, it was conceded by Mr. Jarvis that when applying the elevated
    test, it would be unduly harsh to separate the appellant and his  wife.
    On considering the evidence, I am  satisfied  that  this  is  the  only
    lawful conclusion  that  can  be  reached.  In  the  circumstances  the
    respondent  was  correct  to  identify  that  the  appellant  met   the
    requirements of section 117C(3) of the 2002 Act,  in  conjunction  with
    section  117C(5),  and  accordingly  her  concession  before   me   was
    appropriately made. Mr. Jarvis observed that  the  concession  was  not
    made lightly, and I record that observation. The  appellant  is  to  be
    mindful that if he were to offend again, though on the evidence  before
    me that is highly unlikely, he can expect deportation proceedings to be
    at the forefront of the Secretary of State's considerations.

Notice of Decision

25. By means of a decision dated 11 September 2019 this Tribunal set  aside
    a decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  on  3  July  2019
    pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunal,  Courts  and  Enforcement
    Act 2007.

26. The decision is re-made, and the appellant's appeal is allowed on human
    rights (article 8) grounds.
