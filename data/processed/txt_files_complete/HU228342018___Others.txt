For the Appellants:    Mr Gazzain, Counsel instructed by United Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellants are all nationals of Pakistan. They are respectively a
       mother, father and their three  minor  children.   They  appeal  with
       permission against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
       Malik) to dismiss their linked human rights grounds.

    2. It was common ground that the outcome of these linked appeals  turned
       on the position of  the  two  eldest  children,  both  of  whom  were
       accepted to be 'qualifying' as defined  by  s117D(1)(b)  Nationality,
       Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.   If  these  two  children  could
       demonstrate that it would not be reasonable to expect them  to  leave
       the United Kingdom, and so succeed on 'private  life'  grounds  under
       paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) of the Immigration Rules, then  the  rest  of
       the family would succeed on Article 8 'family life' grounds  pursuant
       to s117B(6).

    3. In addressing that issue the First-tier Tribunal had  regard  to  the
       following matters:

             i) The long residence of the children in question.  The  eldest
                had been here since the 19th January 2011 and so at the date
                of the hearing had been in the United Kingdom 7 years and  5
                months. The second was born here, on the  19th  April  2011,
                and so had been here 7 years and 2 months  at  the  date  of
                hearing;

            ii) Both children are in full time education and are doing  well
                academically;

           iii) Both children could continue their education in Pakistan;

            iv) Both children have a wide circle of friends  at  school  and
                church;

             v) The family generally are integrated in  the  United  Kingdom
                with close connection to their local church;

            vi) There is nothing to suggest that the family would be  unable
                to continue their church activity and worship in Pakistan;

           vii) English is their main language and that is the language used
                in the Pakistani school system. Contrary to the evidence  of
                their mother they do speak some Punjabi at  home.  With  the
                assistance  of  their  parents  they  could  improve   their
                proficiency in that language;

          viii) Although  neither  child  has  any  experience  of  life  in
                Pakistan, they have grown up in a Pakistani household and so
                have "some awareness of some cultural norms  and  traditions
                in Pakistan";

            ix) Both parents are healthy and able to  work.  They  both  had
                good jobs whilst living in Pakistan;

             x) The children have extended family in  Pakistan  including  a
                grandmother, aunts, uncles and cousins;

            xi) None of the children have any health issues of note.

    4. Having weighed all of those factors the Tribunal  concluded  that  it
       would not be unreasonable to expect the children to  go  to  Pakistan
       with their family. Consequently the children could  not  qualify  for
       leave under paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) and all  of  the  linked  appeals
       fell to be dismissed.

    5. The appeal before me, although elaborated in detailed grounds,  turns
       on one point.  Did Judge Malik fail to give the  qualifying  children
       (and so  their  family  members)  the  benefit  of  the  Respondent's
       published policy on how  such  claims  should  be  addressed?    That
       policy, approved by Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan) & Ors [2016]  EWCA  Civ
       705, and by the Upper Tribunal in MT & ET (child's best interests; ex
       tempore pilot) Nigeria [2018] UKUT 88 (IAC), was that there  must  be
       "strong reasons" to  expect  such  children  to  leave.    It  is  Mr
       Gazzain's  submission  that  there  is  nothing  in  KO  (Nigeria)  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53  to  change
       that position.  Had Judge  Malik  asked  herself  whether  there  are
       "strong" or -  as Elias LJ puts it - "powerful" - reasons  to  refuse
       this family leave, her decision may have been different.

    6. For the Secretary of State Mr McVeety agreed that if the  presumption
       endorsed in MA (Pakistan) continued to  operate  in  the  Appellants'
       favour, then it would be difficult to identify what 'strong  reasons'
       there might be for requiring  these  children  to  leave  the  United
       Kingdom today. He further agreed that it was  not  evident  from  the
       First-tier Tribunal decision  whether  Judge  Malik  had  framed  her
       enquiry in these terms.   As to whether this element of the ratio  in
       MA (Pakistan) survived the decision  in  KO  (Nigeria),  that  was  a
       matter for me, but Mr McVeety candidly acknowledged that  the  latest
       Home Office guidance continued to operate in the  children's  favour:
       "the starting point is that we would not normally expect a qualifying
       child to leave the United Kingdom"(see page 50 of the September  2019
       Family Policy Family life (as a partner or parent), private life  and
       exceptional circumstances (Version 3.0)).

       Reasonableness, Strong Reasons and the Private Lives of Children

    7. The state has long recognised, at least since the  policy  'DP3'  was
       published in 1993, that children are a particular class of  applicant
       for immigration leave. Unlike their parents, children cannot be  held
       responsible for their presence in the United  Kingdom,  nor  for  the
       fact that they may be here unlawfully.  Unlike their parents, they go
       about their business -  learning,  exploring  and  making  friends  -
       ignorant of the possibility that they may be asked to give it all  up
       at any point.  That policy set, somewhat  arbitrarily,  a  marker  of
       'seven years  long  residence'  as  the  point  at  which  the  state
       recognised that a child would normally be permitted to  remain  here.
       Successive governments have endorsed that approach.

    8. In 2012 the government made significant changes  to  the  Immigration
       Rules relating to 'long residence'. Reframing  such  applications  in
       terms of the right to private life protected by Article 8  ECHR,  the
       new rule set out a series of alternative tests  by  which  applicants
       could qualify for leave to remain. Anyone  could  qualify  for  leave
       after 20 years; young adults could qualify if they had spent half  of
       their life here; adults who fell into  neither  of  these  categories
       could only succeed by demonstrating that removal would -  in  effect-
       result in a nullification of,  or flagrant interference  with,  their
       private lives.  Children, however, had a test all of  their  own.  In
       its original form  this  rule,  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv),  stipulated
       simply that the child demonstrate that at the date of application  he
       had lived in this country for seven years. The explanatory memorandum
       that accompanied the introduction of the  new  rules  explained  that
       this was in recognition of the fact that for a child, seven years  is
       a long  time.  In  such  a  period  the  child  will  have  put  down
       substantial roots, and the government recognised that  it  would  not
       generally be in the child's best interests  to  interfere  with  that
       stability.

    9. On the 13th December 2012 a statement of changes to  the  Immigration
       Rules amended paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) to its  present  form.  It  now
       stipulates:

           276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave
           to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are  that  at
           the date of application, the applicant:

           (i)   does not fall for refusal under  any  of  the  grounds  in
           Section S-LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. to S-LTR.4.5.  in
           Appendix FM; and

           ...

           (iv)  is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in
           the  UK  for  at  least  7  years  (discounting  any  period  of
           imprisonment) and it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
           applicant to leave the UK; or

   10. What might 'reasonable' mean in this context?

   11. The first point to note is that  the  test  does  not,  as  some  had
       hitherto thought, import a proportionality  balancing  exercise  into
       the rule: KO (Nigeria) [at �16]. The paragraph, as the heading in the
       Immigration Rules suggests, is concerned solely with the private life
       of the child: there is therefore no cause to weigh against that child
       any criminality or misconduct on the part of his or her parents.

   12. The second point to note is that the present scheme, set out in  Part
       5A of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  contains
       three different tests pertaining to children:  reasonableness,  undue
       harshness, and very compelling circumstances  over  and  above  undue
       harshness.   The threshold imposed by each test becomes  increasingly
       higher according to the demands of the public interest.

   13. Where the  public  interest  lies  in  determining  whether  a  child
       applicant under 276ADE(1)(iv) should be granted  leave  is  a  matter
       addressed by the Secretary of State in her published policies. In  MA
       (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 Elias LJ considered and  approved  the
       terms of  the  then  Immigration  Directorates'  Instruction  'Family
       Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0b Family  Life  (as  a  Partner  or
       Parent) and Private Life: 10-Year Routes' in  which  decision  makers
       are instructed as follows:

           11.2.4. Would it be unreasonable to expect a non-British Citizen
           child to leave the UK?

           The requirement that a non-British Citizen child  has  lived  in
           the UK  for  a  continuous  period  of  at  least  the  7  years
           immediately preceding the date of application,  recognises  that
           over time children start to put down roots  and  integrate  into
           life in the UK, to the extent that being required to  leave  the
           UK may be unreasonable. The longer the child has resided in  the
           UK, the more the balance will begin to  swing  in  terms  of  it
           being unreasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the  UK,  and
           strong reasons will be required in order to refuse a  case  with
           continuous UK residence of more than 7 years.

           The decision  maker  must  consider  whether,  in  the  specific
           circumstances of the case, it would be reasonable to expect  the
           child to live in another country.

           The decision maker must consider  the  facts  relating  to  each
           child in the UK in the family individually,  and  also  consider
           all the facts relating to the family as a  whole.  The  decision
           maker should also engage with  any  specific  issues  explicitly
           raised by the family, by each child or on behalf of each child.

           (emphasis added)

   14.  That  same  guidance  was  described  in  KO  (Nigeria)  as  "wholly
       appropriate and sound in law"  [at  �17]  although  the  court  there
       emphasised that it will generally be reasonable to expect a child  to
       live with his or her parents; if  those  parents  have  no  right  to
       remain in the United Kingdom, this is the 'real world' in which  that
       child  is  living,  and  what  is  'reasonable'  must   be   assessed
       accordingly.  Although not cited by directly by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Malik in her decision, it seems likely that it was this part  of  the
       ratio in KO that she had in mind; I say this because her reasoning is
       wholly concerned with an assessment of where the  children's  parents
       should be, i.e. Pakistan. She considers whether the children will  be
       able to communicate there, attend school, adapt and be reunited  with
       parents. As the parties before me agree, all of  that  was  relevant,
       but the Tribunal's  decision  nowhere  addresses  whether  there  are
       "strong reasons", nor indeed any other operative presumption  in  the
       qualifying child's favour.  Was this an error of law?

   15. The decision in KO (Nigeria) has created a peculiar impasse. Decision
       makers are at once told that the fate of the child must be determined
       in line with the 'real world' circumstances of the parents, whilst at
       the same time endorsing Home Office policy  which  clearly  indicates
       that it is the child who comes first. For the avoidance of doubt,  Mr
       McVeety was quite right in his submission that the revised  guidance,
       although it uses a different form  of  words,  remains  the  same  in
       substance:

           The starting point is  that  we  would  not  normally  expect  a
           qualifying child to leave the UK. It is normally  in  a  child's
           best interest for the whole family  to  remain  together,  which
           means if the child is not expected to leave, then the parent  or
           parents or primary carer of the child will also not be  expected
           to leave the UK.

       Family Policy Family life (as a partner or parent), private life  and
       exceptional circumstances Version 5.0 (page 94).

   16. To my mind this impasse can only be successfully navigated by reading
       the  decision in KO to do no more than endorse the  proposition  that
       the real world position of the parents is a  relative  consideration.
       The primary focus of the rule is, and has always  been,  the  private
       life of the qualifying child, established  and  developed  over  long
       years' residence in this country.  If it is reasonable  to  interfere
       with that private life simply because the parents have no  leave,  it
       is difficult to see what the point of the rule might be, since  where
       adults have extant leave their children  are  invariably  granted  in
       line.  Unlike the child applicant in EV (Philippines) v Secretary  of
       State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874 - who had only been
       in this country four years -  parliament has specifically  legislated
       for the private lives of qualifying children, and by extension  those
       of their family members, to receive a measure of protection under the
       Rules.  I accept Mr Gazzain's submission, unopposed by the  Secretary
       of State, that the extent of that protection is bounded by the public
       interest, and that the demands  thereof  can  best  be  discerned  by
       reference to the Secretary of State's published policy. In this  case
       that policy, for over 25 years, has been that the starting  point  is
       that we should not normally expect a qualifying child to leave, since
       by the nature of that 'qualification' that child  has  established  a
       substantial private life and it would be wholly contrary  to  his  or
       her best interest for that to be brought to an end.  I note that this
       interpretation  is  consistent  with  the  current  version  of   the
       Secretary of State's guidance (emphasis added):

           In the caselaw of KO and Others [2018] UKSC 53, with  particular
           reference to the case of NS (Sri Lanka), the Supreme Court found
           that "reasonableness" is to  be  considered  in  the  real-world
           context in  which  the  child  finds  themselves.  The  parents'
           immigration status is a relevant fact to establish that context.
           The determination sets out that if a child's  parents  are  both
           expected to leave the UK, the  child  is  normally  expected  to
           leave with them, unless there is evidence that that it would not
           be reasonable.  This  assessment  must  take  into  account  the
           child's best interests as  a  primary  consideration.  You  must
           carefully  consider  all  the  relevant  points  raised  in  the
           application  and  carefully  assess   any   evidence   provided.
           Decisions  must  not  be  taken  simply  on  the  basis  of  the
           application's assertions about the  child,  but  rather  on  the
           basis of an  examination  of  all  the  evidence  provided.  All
           relevant factors need to be assessed in the round. There may  be
           some specific circumstances where  it  would  be  reasonable  to
           expect  the  qualifying  child  to  leave  the   UK   with   the
           parent(s)....

   17. I therefore accept that the First-tier Tribunal decision in this must
       be set aside. Although the Judge conducted a careful  analysis  which
       took in a number of factors relevant to  the  re-establishment  of  a
       private life in Pakistan, what it did not do was attach any weight to
       the private life which already exists in the United Kingdom, and then
       assess whether there were any "specific  circumstances"  which  meant
       that interference with that private life would be reasonable.

   18. Mr McVeety accepted that applying the guidance approved  in  both  MA
       (Pakistan) and KO (Nigeria) the appeals,  upon  re-making,  would  be
       allowed, since there is nothing in the evidence about this family  to
       indicate  that  there  are  "strong  reasons"   or   even   "specific
       circumstances" to require these children to leave the United  Kingdom
       contrary to their best interests.

   19. The provisions of Part 5A , read together, are intended to provide  a
       structured approach to the application of Article 8 which produces in
       all cases a final result compatible with Article 8 : see CI (Nigeria)
       v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 2027 [at
       �20], NE-A (Nigeria) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
       [2017] EWCA Civ 239 [at �14] and Rhuppiah v Secretary  of  State  for
       the Home Department  [2018]  UKSC  58  [at  �36].  This  decision  is
       concerned with the private lives of two children who  have  lived  in
       this county for approximately nine years. They  go  to  school  here,
       have friends and a home here. They have put down "strong  roots"  and
       it would, the Secretary of State accepts, be contrary to  their  best
       interests for that to be interfered with.   I have given some  weight
       to the findings of the First-tier Tribunal and I accept that it would
       be possible for these children to relocate to Pakistan. It would  not
       however be reasonable. It follows that I allow  the  appeals  of  the
       qualifying children and by extension those of their family members.




       Decisions

   20. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains material  error
       of law and it is set aside.

   21. I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
