                       ERROR OF LAW DECISION & REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
against a decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge Symes dated 18  March  2015,
allowing an appeal by  Mr  Emodi  against  a  decision  dated  27  May  2014
refusing to issue him with a residence card confirming his right  to  reside
as the extended family member of an EEA national.

2.    Mr Emodi is a national of Nigeria, born on 25 April 1970.  He  arrived
in the United Kingdom with leave to enter as a  visitor  until  12  February
2010 and subsequently made applications for  a  residence  card  which  were
refused, as was an application on private  and  family  life  grounds.  This
application was made on 25 March 2014 and was  refused  due  to  a  lack  of
evidence of dependency prior to Mr Emodi's arrival in the United Kingdom.

3.    At the appeal hearing on 13 February 2015, Judge Symes heard  evidence
from Mr Emodi, his cousin, Barnabus Robert,  Mr  Robert's  wife,  Aleksandra
Filipial-Robert, a Polish national and from Mr Emodi's wife,  Augustina.  He
noted at [25] that the issue before him was  relatively  narrow  bearing  in
mind the prior findings of Judge Davidson, set out in  a  decision  dated  8
August 2011. He accepted at [30] that Mr Emodi is a person who qualifies  as
an extended family member and he went on to allow the appeal  on  the  basis
that it  is  appropriate  as  a  matter  of  discretion  to  facilitate  the
Appellant's residence here [33].

4.    On 20 March 2015, the Secretary of State sought permission  to  appeal
on the basis that:

    (i)    there had been a failure to properly apply Devaseelan  in  that,
    although he addresses the principle at [24], he effectively  sought  to
    reinterpret it in such a way as to render it meaningless, and

    (ii)   the Judge had exercised a discretion reserved to  the  Secretary
    of State and he had no jurisdiction to consider regulation 17(4) as the
    Secretary of State had made no decision on 17(4). Permission to  appeal
    was granted in on the basis that  both  grounds  were  arguable,  in  a
    decision dated 8 May 2015.

5.    At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Norton  for  the  Secretary
of State and from Mr Abbas on behalf of Mr Emodi. I reserved my decision.

6.    I find that there is no material error of law in respect of the  first
ground of appeal. Judge Symes correctly directed himself in respect  of  the
decision in Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 000702 and subsequent caselaw on  point:
LD (Algeria) [2004] EWCA Civ 804. He noted correctly at [25] that given  the
prior findings of Judge Davidson, the issue is relatively  narrow  and  that
the history  was  generally  accepted  as  credible.  Judge  Symes  did  not
automatically accept the account of financial remittances  but  went  on  to
consider material caselaw: Moneke (EEA-OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT  341  (IAC)
and Amos [2011]  EWCA  Civ  552  at  [40]  and  concluded  that,  given  the
witnesses were consistent as to the means and frequency of  past  remittance
and bearing in mind they were describing events that happened  more  than  a
decade ago, he accepted the evidence of the witnesses. He correctly  applied
the factual test set out in Reyes (EEA Regs:  dependency)  [2013]  UKUT  314
and Dauhoo (EEA Regulations - reg 8(2) Mauritius [2012] UKUT  79  (IAC)  and
found that Mr  Emodi  was  dependent  on  Barnabus  in  Nigeria  before  the
latter's migration to Poland and then in the United Kingdom and he  accepted
that he is a person who qualified as an extended family member. I note  that
Judge Davidson also heard evidence from 3 of the  same  witnesses  [10]  but
made no finding as to the evidence of the EEA national, Aleksandra Filipial-
Robert, which was clearly capable of corroborating the accounts of Mr  Emodi
and his cousin. Oral evidence can suffice, as Judge Symes  clearly  set  out
with reference to the relevant  jurisprudence  and  it  is  well-established
that to require corroboration is erroneous: cf. Kasolo  [13190].

7.    I do find, however, that in allowing the appeal outright  Judge  Symes
erred materially in law in that, although he made no  express  reference  to
Regulation 17(4) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006,  in  essence  he
conducted the discretionary exercise at  [31]-[32]  that  falls  within  the
remit of the Secretary of State for the Home Department  and  thus  exceeded
his jurisdiction.

8.    There has been no successful challenge to  Judge  Symes'  findings  of
fact, which stand. Therefore, I do not  find  it  necessary  for  a  further
hearing to take place and I re-make the  decision,  upholding  Judge  Symes'
findings and remitting the appeal to the  Secretary  of  State  to  consider
exercising her discretion under regulation 17(4) of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
Regulations 2006 and issuing Mr Emodi with a residence  card  on  the  basis
that he is a person who qualifies as an extended family member.
