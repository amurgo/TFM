Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr B Hawkin, instructed by Paul John & Co Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is a remitted hearing  of  the  Appellants'  appeals  against  the
    decisions of the Secretary of State dated 28th January 2014  to  refuse
    their applications for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    as adult dependent relatives outside the Immigration Rules.

2.   The first Appellant,  AT,  was  born  on  [  ]  1936,  and  the  second
    Appellant, EX, was born on [ ] 1982.  AT is the grandmother of  EX  and
    they are both citizens of India. The Sponsor, AX, is the daughter of AT
    and the mother of EX.  She  and  her  husband,  XS,  are  both  British
    citizens and have been living and working in the UK for some time.

3.   On 20th August 2012 the Appellants were  issued  with  a  family  visit
    visa valid until 20th  February  2013.  They  entered  the  UK  on  2nd
    November 2012 and were granted leave to enter until 20th February 2013.
    On 18th February 2013 the Appellants made an application for indefinite
    leave to remain in the UK as  adult  dependent  relatives  outside  the
    Immigration Rules. The basis of  this  application  was  EX's  personal
    circumstances.  She is mentally disabled, blind and requiring  constant
    care from her family. AT cared for EX in India . However, AT was at the
    time of application almost 77 years old and in need  of  care  herself.
    There were no family members in India who could care for them.

4.   This matter has a complicated procedural history, which  is  fully  set
    out in the Appellants' skeleton argument.  For  the  purposes  of  this
    appeal, the Court of Appeal remitted the matter to the  Upper  Tribunal
    for the following reasons. Neither the Appellants  nor  the  Respondent
    furnished the Upper Tribunal Judge with any or any substantial and  up-
    to-date evidence as to the availability and cost in India of specialist
    care of the type required by EX in particular. The Appellants submitted
    that such care would not be available  or  affordable.  The  Respondent
    submitted  that  the  Appellants  would  be  able  to  access  suitable
    residential care together. The Upper Tribunal Judge  was  justified  in
    observing that he was being invited to address this issue in  something
    of an evidential vacuum.

5.   The parties before the Court of Appeal agreed that a proper  assessment
    of Article 8 proportionality required consideration of objective and up-
    to-date evidence of the availability and cost of  appropriate  care  in
    India and the ability of the Appellants to  avail  themselves  of  such
    care in the event of their return. Any assertion by either party as  to
    the likelihood of the Appellants' care needs being  adequately  met  in
    India should be supported by evidence. The parties considered  that  it
    would be inappropriate to return an Appellant such  as  EX  whose  care
    needs are clearly extensive and for  whom  the  consequences  of  being
    unable to access  adequate  care  are  potentially  severe  without  an
    assessment of the type described above being undertaken. It was  agreed
    that the appropriate forum to undertake the evidential  assessment  was
    the Upper Tribunal and the matter was remitted for prompt disposal.

6.   Accordingly, the issue before me is whether the Appellants,  even  with
    the practical and financial help of the Sponsor, are able to obtain the
    required level of care India. The appeal is on Article 8 grounds  since
    neither of the Appellants can satisfy E-ECDR.1.1.  of  the  Immigration
    Rules because they did not have  entry  clearance  as  adult  dependent
    relatives.  They came to the UK as visitors.


7.   The relevant Immigration Rule in assessing the issue before me is at E-
    ECDR.2.5. which states:-

         "The applicant or, if the  applicant  and  their  partner  are  the
         sponsor's parents or grandparents, the applicant's partner, must be
         unable, even with the practical and financial help of the  sponsor,
         to obtain the required level of care in the country where they  are
         living, because -


         (a)  it is not available and there is no person in that country who
             can reasonably provide it; or


         (b)  it is not affordable".

8.   Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor made the  following  findings
    which have not been challenged and are preserved.  EX  has  significant
    cognitive impairments  and  functional  limitations  arising  from  her
    conditions of global development delay  and  blindness.  She  has  very
    significant care needs as a direct result of her conditions,  including
    washing, dressing, accessing the toilet, taking adequate nutrition  and
    moving around both in and outdoors. Her ability  to  care  for  herself
    will never materially improve. EX requires 24-hour care involving  both
    intimate and non-intimate aspects. She requires emotional  support  and
    assistance to be able to go out and socially interact with others.  The
    care required could not be provided by a man, whether he was a relative
    or not.

9.   In relation to AT, the judge made the following findings.  She  suffers
    from foot pain, lethargy, microalbuminuria, hypertension  and  type  II
    diabetes. AT had been able to provide the necessary care for EX  whilst
    they were living in India. However, there had been a genuine change  in
    circumstances since the Appellants arrived in the UK.  AT  was  getting
    frailer and this had led to an inability to provide care  for  EX.  The
    change in AT's health and overall ability to provide  significant  care
    for EX had materially reduced. AT could not now provide by herself  the
    overall  required  level  of  care  for  EX.  The  Appellants   had   a
    particularly strong bond and it would be contrary to the  interests  of
    EX, in particular, for her to be  separated  from  AT.  There  were  no
    relatives in India who would have in the past  provided,  or  would  be
    likely in the future to provide assistance to the Appellants,  although
    there were two sons who may be able to offer some financial support.

The Sponsor's evidence

10.  AX relied on her witness statement,  which  she  signed  and  dated  at
    court, and the documents in the Appellants' bundle. She said  that  she
    provided care for her daughter which involved getting  her  up  out  of
    bed, taking her to the toilet, dressing, feeding  her  and  taking  her
    out. She had to provide all the necessary care for her daughter because
    she was completely blind and could not talk. It was often difficult  to
    understand what she was saying.

11.  The Sponsor worked as a nanny for  three  to  five  days  a  week.  Her
    employers were understanding of her home situation and  she  was  given
    leave when she needed it.  There was a carer coming  to  her  home  for
    three hours twice a week to look after both  Appellants.  AT  could  no
    longer look after EX because she was suffering from giddiness and could
    not now hold or support EX.

12.  The Sponsor had obtained a letter from the local council in Kerala  and
    from the parish priest and these appeared at pages 14  and  15  of  the
    Appellants' bundle.  The Sponsor confirmed that there were no relatives
    in India, although her son lived in Malta and there was a  letter  from
    him at page 10 of  the  bundle.  EX  would  suffer  great  distress  if
    separated from the Sponsor because she had been living in  the  UK  for
    almost five years. EX did not like being alone and preferred to be with
    someone. AT also stated that she wished to stay with the Sponsor  until
    she died.

13.  In cross-examination, the Sponsor confirmed that there was a carer  who
    came twice a week for three hours. This had been arranged by  a  social
    worker through an agency.  Social Services were paying  for  that  care
    and it had been arranged by the Sponsor's GP.  The  care  was  for  EX,
    although the carer would take both Appellants out and sit and  talk  to
    them. The GP had not arranged any specific care for AT. The  carer  was
    able to  communicate  because  she  spoke  the  same  language  as  the
    Appellants.

14.  Mr Melvin stated that the Home Office were of the view that  home  care
    could be provided for ï¿½75 per month in India. The Sponsor  stated  that
    there was no one near their house in Kerala who could provide care  for
    EX and she could not live elsewhere.  She was a girl and she would  not
    know what was happening to her or be able to tell anyone if she was not
    cared for properly. The Sponsor needed to look after EX  and  keep  her
    safe. Previously, the Sponsor's mother and father, when he  was  alive,
    had looked after EX.

15.  The Sponsor had  obtained  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  2012  and
    thereafter had invited her family to visit. She still had  a  house  in
    Kerala, but nobody was living there. The Appellants could not return to
    the house and have live-in assistance because there was no-one who  was
    willing to look after them and there was nobody who was  able  to  look
    after EX. The Sponsor confirmed that there was nobody in her home  area
    who was willing or capable of looking  after  EX.  There  may  well  be
    somebody in the city, but she did not have a home there and it was  too
    expensive to live there.

16.   EX  was  not  taking  very  much  medication  and  was   having   some
    investigation by ultrasound.  Before she came to the UK she was not  on
    any medication, although she had had  three  operations  on  her  eyes.
    Before she lost her sight  EX  was  walking  nicely.  The  Sponsor  had
    written to the church and local council and asked for assistance.  Both
    the councillor  and  the  parish  priest  knew  the  family.  When  the
    Appellants were living in India the Sponsor would  visit  them  once  a
    year.




17.  I asked the Sponsor if she had tried to find someone to look after  her
    daughter in India and she replied: "No-one will come. They  want  their
    own life and you cannot believe all the people."

18.  In re-examination the Sponsor stated that her  house  was  a  long  way
    from the city and it would take three to five hours  to  get  there  by
    bus. It took five hours by car to get to her house from the airport.

19.  The Sponsor's husband relied on his witness statement dated  31st  July
    2017 as evidence-in-chief.  He was not cross-examined.

Submissions

20.  Mr Melvin submitted that the appeal was on a very narrow point  of  the
    availability of care in India. He relied on the Country of  Information
    Response [COIR], which he had submitted with  a  skeleton  argument  on
    31st July 2017. He submitted that  there  were  adequate  in-home  care
    facilities available and there was also residential care,  although  it
    was more expensive.   In-home  care  would  cost  ï¿½75  per  month.  The
    Appellants were currently receiving  Social  Services  care  for  three
    hours twice a week and this was at the taxpayers'  expense.  There  was
    nothing in the evidence which showed that  the  Appellants  required  a
    trained professional  to  care  for  them.  Their  medical  needs  were
    limited. They required assistance with day-to-day care. EX was  not  on
    any medication and had been receiving all  her  medical  treatment  and
    care in India before coming to the UK. The Appellants  had  a  property
    available to  them  in  India.  The  Sponsor  had  not  made  extensive
    enquiries in the local area as to the availability of assistance and Mr
    Melvin did not accept her assertion that  nobody  would  come  to  look
    after EX. The Sponsor had made no enquiries of available  help  in  her
    local area.

21.  Mr Melvin submitted that, in the absence  of  evidence  disputing  that
    submitted  by  the  Respondent,  care  was  available  in  India  at  a
    relatively inexpensive cost and which could be paid for by  the  family
    in the UK. Mr Melvin submitted that I should place little weight on the
    two pieces of local evidence from persons known to the family who  were
    providing assistance to the family in their application  to  remain  in
    the UK.  The letters were not indicative of the availability of nursing
    care in the local area.  Mr  Melvin  referred  to  an  article  in  the
    Appellants' bundle which stated that there were elder care  specialists
    for the cost of Rs12,000 to Rs14,000 per month. The Appellants were not
    unfit to travel. They had travelled to the UK in late 2012 after making
    applications for entry clearance as visitors. There was  adequate  care
    available so they would be unable to satisfy the entry clearance rules.
    There were no compelling and compassionate circumstances to  warrant  a
    grant of leave outside the Immigration Rules.

22.  On the facts of this appeal, the Appellants had accommodation and  care
    in their home country  and  the  refusal  of  indefinite  leave  was  a
    proportionate response. Mr Melvin relied on  his  written  submissions.
    The information request clearly showed that  24  hour  in-home  nursing
    care by a trained  nursing  assistant  was  available  in  India  at  a
    reasonable cost. There was also evidence that care was available by non-
    medically trained domestic workers in India and there were a wide range
    of residential care options in the private sector. The Appellants could
    obtain  medical  treatment  and  care  in  India  and  that  care   was
    affordable.  The  public  interest  in  immigration  control  and   the
    protection of public  services,  which  are  currently  under  enormous
    pressure in the UK, was not outweighed  by  the  circumstances  of  the
    Appellants' case.

23.  Mr Hawkin submitted that  this  was  a  sad  case  and  the  procedural
    history was set out in his skeleton argument. He submitted that Article
    8 was engaged and the first issue before  me  was  the  level  of  care
    required by  EX.  She  required  long-term  personal  care  to  perform
    everyday tasks. Mr Hawkin relied on the  unreported  case  of  Osman  v
    Entry Clearance Officer (OA/18244/2012). There were no  other  reported
    decisions on long-term personal care. The Tribunal found, on the  facts
    of that case, that a person would not be able to provide  the  required
    level of care, to meet the appellant's needs to perform everyday tasks,
    which could only be fully provided by a close family member. Mr  Hawkin
    submitted that the situation was the same in this case.

24.  The medical evidence and the judge's  preserved  findings  showed  that
    EX's care and her emotional needs could not be met outside  the  direct
    family circle. Because of the nature of her  afflictions  and  her  low
    ability to communicate, she had only ever  lived  with  her  mother  or
    grandmother, it would be very difficult for  any  other  individual  to
    deal with EX. The problems she had were fundamental and  broad  ranging
    in nature. There were also cultural issues. EX's care needs could  only
    be met within the family.  Although a carer did come twice a  week  for
    three hours, the times of her visits were limited and her  duties  were
    to take both Appellants out for a walk and to chat to them.  There  was
    limited input by such a  carer  and  her  role  was  a  long  way  from
    providing other care that the Sponsor provided.  The  Sponsor  provided
    for all the EX's needs and her communication was  such  that  the  only
    individuals who can understand and care for her are  within  the  close
    family circle.

25.  Mr Hawkin referred to the COIR and noted that it was  undated  and  the
    costs of care were likely  to  have  increased.  This  was  not  strong
    evidence to deal with the complicated facts and needs of this case. The
    Sponsor's evidence was that their home in  Kerala  was  three  to  five
    hours by bus to the city and to her knowledge there was no-one  in  the
    area who would take on a live-in care role of this kind, caring for  an
    81 year old woman and a 34 year  old  woman  with  complex  needs.  The
    Sponsor had also provided evidence from  a  local  councillor  and  the
    parish priest which stated that there were  not  enough  facilities  to
    look after EX. There were no special schools or rehabilitation centres.
    This was evidence on which I could place weight because the Sponsor had
    not put words in the mouths of the  authors  of  the  letters  and  the
    provenance of the letters was not challenged.

26.  There were  also  quotes  from  background  material  in  the  skeleton
    argument, which showed that women with disabilities  were  not  treated
    kindly. This supported the Sponsor's evidence that there was no one  in
    the local area to provide the kind of care necessary. The  evidence  in
    the background material  was  that  there  was  discrimination  against
    persons with  disabilities  in  employment,  education  and  access  to
    healthcare,  which  was  more  pervasive  in   rural   areas.   Despite
    legislation that all public buildings and transport  be  accessible  to
    persons with disabilities, there was limited accessibility.  Women  and
    girls with psychological or intellectual disabilities in India continue
    to be locked up in overcrowded and unsanitary  state  mental  hospitals
    and residential institutions without their consent due  to  stigma  and
    the absence of adequate  community  based  support  and  mental  health
    services.

27.  The  evidence  in  the  US  State  Department  Report  for  India  2016
    supported the Sponsor's evidence  that  EX  would  be  open  to  abuse,
    neglect or ill treatment in a residential home and also by a  carer  in
    the family home. EX could not communicate what had happened to  her  if
    she was  abused.   She  was  a  very  vulnerable  female  and  disabled
    individual. The background material showed that there is not the  level
    of care that EX requires in India. Mr Hawkin also  submitted  that  the
    Home Office guidance was highly material to any interpretation  of  the
    Immigration Rules and the Appellants' case was very similar to  one  of
    the scenarios set out in that guidance.  Mr Hawkin relied on Paposhvili
    v Belgium (App no. 41738/10) and argued that there  was  an  Article  3
    dimension to the case and therefore  the  case  had  to  be  looked  at
    carefully.

28.  Mr Hawkin submitted that the Deputy Upper Tribunal  judge's  conclusion
    that the Sponsor and her husband could leave the UK  to  care  for  the
    Appellants was flawed because they  were  both  UK  citizens  who  were
    working as a kitchen porter  and  domestic  worker.  It  would  not  be
    feasible for them to move back to India because they would not be  able
    to provide for both Appellants. This was not an  issue  in  the  appeal
    given the remittal by the Court of Appeal.  EX  needed  care  by  close
    family members and as British citizens the Sponsor and her husband were
    not required to leave the UK.

29.  In response, Mr Melvin submitted that there was no record of  abuse  of
    EX and Paposhvili was not relevant. There was  no  reason  why  British
    citizens could not relocate to India.

Discussion and Conclusions

30.  I rely on the preserved findings of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-
    Taylor set out at paragraphs 9 and 10 of this decision. AT  is  now  81
    years old and is no longer able to care for EX. She has a  particularly
    strong bond with EX and it would be detrimental to the health and  well
    being of EX is she was separated from AT. I must therefore look at  the
    situation on the basis that the Appellants remain together.

31.  EX is now 34 years old. She  has  very  significant  care  needs  as  a
    direct result of her conditions. That care is currently being  provided
    for by her mother, the Sponsor. EX also  suffers  from  some  menstrual
    difficulties which were under investigation and were being  dealt  with
    by the Sponsor. EX's care needs are very complex  and  demanding.  They
    are  of  an  extremely  intimate  nature.   She   has   difficulty   in
    communicating and has only ever lived with her mother and  grandmother.
    AT is no longer able to provide physical care for her  needs  since  AT
    can no longer support her or lift her, and that  role  has  been  taken
    over by the Sponsor since the Appellants came to the UK. This change in
    circumstances, since the Appellant's came to the UK  as  visitors,  was
    not an issue in this appeal.

32.  I find that looking at all the evidence before me, the  level  of  care
    required by EX is of a highly intimate and personal nature and  is  one
    that can only be provided for by a close  family  member  such  as  her
    grandmother when she was able  to,  and  now  her  mother.  It  is  not
    appropriate for EX to be cared for by  somebody  other  than  a  family
    member. She is blind, she is referred  to  as  mute,  but  the  Sponsor
    stated she could communicate, although it is difficult for  her  to  be
    understood. It would not be appropriate for another person to take over
    her 24-hour care given that a close family member has  always  provided
    it.

33.  I accept Mr Melvin's submission  that  in-home  care  is  available  in
    India and I appreciate that the Sponsor  receives  help  from  a  carer
    organised by a social worker.  The  carer  comes  and  takes  out  both
    Appellants and talks to them for three hours twice a week. However, the
    main responsibility for dressing, bathing, feeding and dealing with all
    EX's needs is the Sponsor, her mother. The carer's role is  limited  in
    that respect. I also find that since EX needs 24 hour care and she  has
    to remain with her grandmother, it would not be appropriate, and indeed
    would be impossible to find residential care for both of the Appellants
    if they were returned to India. EX's needs could not be met in  a  care
    home for the elderly.

34.  There is a risk that EX, as a vulnerable adult, will suffer neglect  or
    ill treatment because she would be unable to express herself. There was
    also evidence in the background material of the  stigma  and  isolation
    faced by those with psychological or intellectual disabilities and  the
    absence of adequate community based support and mental health services.
    EX certainly could not be returned to India to residential care, either
    alone or with her grandmother, on  the  evidence  before  me.  The  two
    require totally separate caring needs. The matter could only be catered
    for by in-home care,  which  although  available,  is  not  appropriate
    because the care needs of EX can only be provided  by  a  close  female
    family member.

35.  Accordingly, I find that the Appellants have shown that they  would  be
    unable, even with practical and  financial  help  of  the  Sponsor,  to
    obtain the required level of care in India because there is  no  person
    in India who can reasonably provide it. There were no  family  members,
    with whom EX has lived, to provide that care and therefore the issue of
    whether it is affordable is not relevant.

36.  In assessing Article 8, I find that both Appellants  have  a  level  of
    dependency on the Sponsor, such that it amounts to family life.  Whilst
    they were living independently in India prior to coming to the  UK,  it
    is clear from the previous undisturbed findings  of  the  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal judge that there has been  a  change  in  circumstances  since
    their arrival in the UK. The  Appellants  have  been  living  with  the
    Sponsor for almost five years and have become dependent on  her.  I  am
    satisfied that they have established family life in the  UK  and  their
    removal and  the  refusal  of  leave  to  remain  would  amount  to  an
    interference.

37.  Such an interference would be in accordance with  the  law  given  that
    neither Appellant can satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules
    because neither had valid entry clearance as dependent  relatives  when
    they came to the UK.   However,  in  assessing  proportionality  it  is
    relevant that they are able to satisfy the substantive requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules and fail only on this technicality.  I weigh this
    into the balance in assessing proportionality.

38.  In favour of the public interest  there  is  the  fact  that  both  the
    Appellants came to the UK as visitors. They have  remained  in  the  UK
    after their visit visa expired for  about  four  years.  Their  medical
    conditions mean that they  will  be  reliant  on  the  National  Health
    Service and they require the assistance  of  a  social  worker  and  an
    agency carer. These matters are all being paid for  by  the  state  and
    therefore their presence in the UK affects the  economic  wellbeing  of
    the country.

39.  However, such matters are outweighed by  the  compelling  circumstances
    in this case, namely the very complex special needs of EX and the  fact
    that she can no longer be properly cared for by AT. They came to the UK
    as visitors, but circumstances have since changed. They have not sought
    to  deceive  Immigration  Officials  or  failed  to  comply  with   the
    Immigration Rules. Their application for indefinite leave to remain was
    made before their visit visa expired and the only reason an application
    would fail under the Rules was because it was not for  the  reason  for
    which they entered.  That reason has been answered  by  the  change  in
    circumstances.

40.  Accordingly, taking into account all the matters,  I  find  on  balance
    that the public interest in maintaining  immigration  control  and  the
    interests of the economic wellbeing of the country  are  outweighed  by
    the Article 8 rights to family and private life of both Appellants.  EX
    cannot be separated from AT. EX  has  complex  needs  which  amount  to
    compelling circumstances. It would be disproportionate for AT to return
    to India on her own because it would affect the health and wellbeing of
    EX. There were no family members to support  AT  were  she  to  return.
    Although I accept that in-home care or residential  care  may  well  be
    available for AT, the fact is that she cannot be returned  because  she
    provides a level of care and emotional support to EX by  being  present
    in the home in the UK while the Sponsor is at  work.  I  find  that  it
    would breach EX's Article 8 rights if AT returned to India.

41.  Accordingly, taking into account all the material  before  me,  I  find
    that the refusal of indefinite  leave  amounts  to  a  disproportionate
    interference with the Appellants' rights to family and private life and
    breaches Article 8. I  allow  the  Appellants'  appeals  on  Article  8
    grounds.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
for the  following  reason.  The  Appellants  failed  to  submit  sufficient
evidence at the appeal before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor.
