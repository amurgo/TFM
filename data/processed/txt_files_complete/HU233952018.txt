Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Collins, instructed by RVS Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Ukrainian national who was born on 11 May 1948.  She
    appeals against a decision which  was  issued  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Freer on 1 July 2019, dismissing her appeal against  the  refusal
    of leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. The appellant sought leave to remain with her son, Dr [LS],  who  is  a
    British citizen who was born on 15 April 1974.  Dr [S] came to  the  UK
    as  a  post-doctoral  researcher  in  2001  and  subsequently  obtained
    citizenship.  He now works in a senior and well-remunerated position at
    an investment company in the City.  The appellant was a doctor  in  the
    Ukraine.  She worked in respiratory medicine for  44  years,  providing
    specialist care to people suffering from tuberculosis,  meningitis  and
    encephalitis during her career. The appellant was consequently involved
    in providing care for those affected by the  Chernobyl  disaster.   Her
    own health suffered as a result and she has suffered particularly  with
    heart problems since around 1999.  The appellant has visited her son in
    the UK on a number of occasions since 2005.   During  one  such  visit,
    following  a  serious  deterioration  in  her  health,  the   appellant
    underwent surgery at Kings Hospital in  May  2017.   She  has  received
    significant medical intervention in the UK  since  that  date,  all  of
    which has been  paid  for  privately  by  the  sponsor  at  a  cost  of
    approximately �100,000.  Her case before Judge Freer was,  in  summary,
    that it would be a breach of Article 8 ECHR to remove her  to  Ukraine,
    since she is dependent upon her son and would receive  inadequate  care
    in her own country.

 3. In a lengthy reserved decision, Judge Freer dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal.  In many respects,  it  is  a  thoughtful  assessment.   Having
    considered the grounds upon which permission to appeal was  granted  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic, however, it was  to  Ms  Isherwood  that  I
    turned at the outset of the hearing.  As I explained to her,  I  had  a
    number of concerns about  Judge  Freer's  decision.   Having  heard  Ms
    Isherwood's determined submissions, I regret to say that those concerns
    remain and that  I  have  concluded  that  Judge  Freer's  decision  is
    vitiated by errors of law which render it unsustainable.  These are  my
    reasons for so concluding.

 4. Firstly, the right of appeal against the Secretary of State's  decision
    was on human rights grounds.  The structure of the assessment which was
    required should therefore have been clear.  Unless Article 8  ECHR  was
    engaged, whether in its family or its private life aspect,  the  appeal
    could not succeed: Charles [2018] Imm AR 911.  In a case  such  as  the
    present, therefore, much  of  the  judge's  focus  should  be  directed
    towards the question which arises out of the line  of  authority  which
    includes (but is by no means limited to) Britcits [2017] EWCA Civ  368;
    [2017] 1 WLR 3345 and the authorities considered by the Master  of  the
    Rolls at [61].  The judge was required to consider, therefore,  whether
    there are more than normal emotional ties between the appellant and the
    sponsor.  It is a matter of concern, therefore, that the  single  point
    in the decision where the judge turned to that question is [71],  which
    reads as follows:

         "[71]    The one ray of light is her high earning and devoted  son.
         I cannot find her relationship with him goes 'beyond  normal  ties'
         because he goes to work full time without her.  He only deals  with
         her needs at evenings, weekends and on the phone.  He has help from
         Bluebird."

 5. I expressed concern to Ms Isherwood that this finding  appeared  to  be
    inadequately reasoned or based on a misdirection in  law,  in  that  it
    seemed to reduce the requisite assessment to merely physical  elements,
    when what was required was  a  holistic  assessment  of  the  role  the
    sponsor plays in the life of the appellant, in order to decide  whether
    Article 8 ECHR was engaged in its family life aspect.   Ms  Isherwood's
    response was that nothing more was  required,  since  there  was  scant
    evidence of any type of dependency beyond the physical help provided by
    the appellant to the sponsor in the evenings and at the weekends.

 6. I cannot accept that submission.    There was extensive evidence before
    the judge which bore on the Kugathas  [2003]  INLR  170  question,  not
    least of which were the statements prepared by the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor and a short report dated 20 May  2019  from  a  counsellor  and
    psychotherapist named Julia Lofts.  That report detailed the fact  that
    the appellant is suffering from severe clinical depression and that she
    had been required to learn how to speak and walk  again  following  the
    events of 2017.   The  report  stated  that  the  appellant  found  her
    position particularly difficult because she had always been independent
    but she now found herself needing physical and emotional  support  from
    her son and others.  In the face of evidence such as this,  I  consider
    that it was an error of law for the judge to reduce  the  Article  8(1)
    assessment to the four sentences I have reproduced above.  This was not
    a distillation; it was an over-simplification, and a  conclusion  which
    was reached without reference to relevant material.

 7. Secondly, there is a section of  the  judge's  decision  which  appears
    under the sub-heading 'Discussion of  public  interest  questions',  at
    [72]-[76].  At [73], the judge expressed his 'considered opinion'  that
    the sponsor

         "... needed to produce a letter from his employer stating in  terms
         that when he was hired it was well advertised  but  there  were  no
         other job applicants and he cannot now be replaced, no  matter  how
         much they will advertise."

 8. At [74], the judge noted that the sponsor had secured  a  pay  rise  of
    �30,000 but he stated that this was 'not proof of  the  matter  I  need
    proved'.  I raised my concern about this section of the  decision  with
    Ms Isherwood.  With her usual frankness, she stated that she could  not
    understand why the judge thought that these questions were in  any  way
    relevant.  She agreed with me that it appeared to be the case that  the
    judge was asking whether the sponsor was in a shortage  occupation  but
    it was wholly unclear why he had  considered  any  such  question.   Ms
    Isherwood's submission was, however, that any error in this respect was
    immaterial given the rest of the findings made by the judge.

 9. I cannot accept that submission.  Paragraphs [72]-[85] of Judge Freer's
    decision represents his assessment  of  proportionality  under  Article
    8(2).  The parts of the decision which I  have  reproduced  immediately
    above represent findings adverse to the appellant which  were  factored
    into that balancing exercise.  The judge concluded, as  I  have  shown,
    that the sponsor had failed to prove a matter which was required to  be
    proved.  If, as  Ms  Isherwood  realistically  conceded,  this  was  an
    irrelevant line of enquiry for the  judge,  it  must  follow  that  the
    assessment of proportionality was skewed  by  the  introduction  of  an
    irrelevant matter.  I do not accept  that  an  improper  entry  on  the
    balance sheet of proportionality which was expressed  in  these  strong
    terms can  simply  be  dismissed  as  immaterial.   The  judge  clearly
    concluded that the sponsor had failed to prove something and this was a
    factor which was wrongly held against the appellant.

10.  Thirdly, also in that section of the judge's decision  which  concerns
    the proportionality of the respondent's decision, we find the following
    sentence:

         "It would therefore appear that the only or major problem  is  that
         the respondent did not grant a long enough period of leave  in  the
         first instance and can now remedy that by extending it, which would
         be a proportionate outcome on this occasion."

11. As Mr Collins submitted in his grounds of appeal, it is very  difficult
    to understand why the judge thought that it would be  proportionate  to
    grant the appellant an extension of leave but went on  to  dismiss  her
    appeal. The manner in which he expressed the finding is  critical.   He
    did not conclude that  it  would  be  'kinder'  or  'less  harsh',  for
    example; the language he used was of proportionality.  In  common  with
    Mr Collins, I cannot understand the process of reasoning by  which  the
    judge concluded that giving the appellant  what  she  wanted  (she  had
    never asked for settlement) would be proportionate but then, two  pages
    later, that it would nevertheless be proportionate to remove  her  from
    the United Kingdom.  As with the concern I have  identified  above,  Ms
    Isherwood was unable to support the judge's reasoning process  in  this
    regard, instead submitting that the error was immaterial to the overall
    assessment.  Again, I cannot accept that submission.  Having  erred  in
    his assessment of Article 8(1), the judge fell into  serious  error  in
    assessing Article 8(2), in that he expressed  two  findings  which  are
    accepted on both sides to be contradictory.

12. Fourthly, and this was another point to which Judge Kekic made specific
    reference in her decision on permission,  there  is  no  assessment  of
    whether or not  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    appellant's re-integration to Ukraine.  Ms Isherwood  valiantly  strove
    to submit that the judge would have resolved this question adversely to
    the appellant if he had turned his mind to it, given  the  findings  he
    had made about the availability of care in Ukraine.   I  cannot  accept
    that submission.  The questions the  judge  was  required  to  consider
    under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) have been examined by the Court of Appeal
    in Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813; [2016] 4 WLR 152 and Parveen [2018] EWCA
    Civ 932.

13. It did not suffice, in my judgment, for the judge to conclude that  the
    appellant could receive physical care in  the  Ukraine.   He  was  also
    required to consider, as Sales LJ put it at [14] of his judgment in the
    former case, whether the appellant would be 'able to operate on a  day-
    to-day basis in that society and to build up within a reasonable time a
    variety of human relationships to give substance  to  the  individual's
    private or family life'.  The appellant obviously lived and  worked  in
    the Ukraine for many years.  She speaks the  language.   She  has  some
    relatives there, albeit that they live hours away from her former  home
    area.  But she will not be returning to the status quo ante; her mental
    and physical health has deteriorated significantly and it was for  that
    reason  that  Mr  Collins  submitted  to  the  judge   that   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) applied.  The judge failed to grapple with that  question
    at all.  Had he found in her favour upon it, that  finding  would  have
    been determinative of the appeal: TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA  Civ  1109;
    [2018] Imm AR 1301.  The answer to that question  was  not  a  foregone
    conclusion as a result of the other findings reached by the judge.

14. I have not found it necessary to consider the remainder of Mr  Collins'
    criticism of the judge's decision.  It is not necessary, in particular,
    for me to dwell on a number of aspects of the  judge's  decision  which
    are justifiably described in the grounds as being either  'bizarre'  or
    difficult to understand.  I have already alluded to one  such  area  of
    concern.  There is at least one more, which is to be found at [68],  in
    which the judge stated that the appellant would find it 'very difficult
    to succeed without painting an extreme picture or  marrying  a  British
    citizen'.  In addition to the criticism levelled by Mr Collins  in  the
    grounds, he submitted before me that this comment in the  decision  had
    caused very real distress to the appellant and the sponsor, insofar  as
    it suggested that there was an element of deceit on their part.  I  can
    well imagine how that might be so, and do not consider  these  to  have
    been appropriate remarks.  A self-direction with reference  to  Agyarko
    [2017] UKSC 11; [2017] 1 WLR 823 would have sufficed, and the judge had
    no need (even impliedly) to suggest that this  vulnerable  woman  might
    have to marry a  British  citizen  in  order  to  succeed  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

15. Be that as it may, the errors I have identified above  suffice,  in  my
    judgment, for me firmly to conclude that the decision cannot stand.  It
    is a decision which is shot through with fundamental  error  throughout
    the Article 8  ECHR  assessment  and  it  would  be  erroneous,  in  my
    judgment, to attempt to preserve any part of it.  The  correct  course,
    as agreed by the advocates before me, is for the judge's decision to be
    set aside as a whole and for the appeal to be remitted  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal for redetermination de novo.

16. Mr Collins asked me to direct that the remitted hearing is preceded  by
    a CMR and that any future hearings should be listed in accordance  with
    his availability.  I declined to make either direction since these  are
    matters for Taylor House.  Had the decision been  for  me,  however,  I
    would have been likely to accede to the second  request.   The  sponsor
    attended the hearing before me and is plainly very  anxious  about  his
    mother's situation.  He is not entitled to a date which guarantees  his
    choice of counsel but it might well alleviate his anxiety  somewhat  if
    there is continuity of representation.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  vitiated  by  legal  error  and
cannot stand.  I set that decision aside and remit the appeal to the FtT  to
be heard de novo by a judge other than Judge Freer.

No anonymity direction is made.
