Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr P Collins, instructed by David A Grand Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms E Savage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mojidat Romoke Oseni,  date  of  birth  27.10.91,  is  a
    citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Beach promulgated 11.3.15, dismissing her appeal against  the  decision
    of the Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  her  application  for  an  EEA
    Residence Card as the child of an EEA citizen exercising Treaty  rights
    in the UK, pursuant to the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 28.1.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Colyner  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    18.5.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.9.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I find there was no error of law in the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Beach to be set aside.

 6. On 9.1.14 the appellant and her brother applied for residence cards  as
    confirmation of a right to reside in the UK  as  the  children  of  the
    sponsor, named in the application as Mr Olasunkanmi Oseni, a citizen of
    Germany, pursuant to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 7. The applications were both refused as the Secretary of State noted  the
    birth certificates named their father as Mr Rasheed  Oseni,  which  the
    Secretary of State confirmed to be a Nigerian citizen,  date  of  birth
    25.1.68. The Secretary of State was not satisfied  that  the  appellant
    and her  brother  were  related  to  the  EEA  national  named  in  the
    application.

 8. At the appeal hearing before Judge Beach  on  28.1.15,  Mr  Oseni  gave
    evidence denying making a visit visa application in the name of Rasheed
    Oseni, which application names the appellant and  her  brother  as  his
    children. He denied that Rasheed  had  ever  been  part  of  his  name,
    despite the fact that it  appears  as  such  on  the  children's  birth
    certificates.

 9. Judge Beach had the benefit of two different DNA analysis reports.  The
    first, from Cellmark, confirmed that the appellant's brother is the son
    of the  sponsor.  However,  this  report  disclosed  a  discrepancy  in
    relation to the appellant. "The DNA results  indicate  a  close  family
    relationship but are not conclusive as to  the  exact  nature  of  this
    relationship and the strength of the likelihood  should  be  considered
    along with other available evidence." However, there is no  explanation
    within the report, or any further evidence adduced, as to what is meant
    by close family relationship.  It would have been helping both to Judge
    Beach and to myself in considering the error  of  law  appeal  to  have
    further clarification. That the appellant and the sponsor  are  closely
    related does not mean that they are necessarily  father  and  daughter.
    Close relationship must surely include uncle and niece, or cousins,  or
    similar.  Thus  the  Cellmark  report  is  not,  at  least  by  itself,
    sufficient  to  demonstrate  the  claimed  relationship,  as  only  the
    parent/child relationship is sufficient for the application made.

10. An explanation for the discrepancy proffered by Cellmark is that  there
    has been a rare genetic mutation. As such is rare it can hardly  amount
    to  a  balance  of  probabilities  likelihood.  Again,   some   further
    information from Cellmark would have been of assistance and it  is  not
    unreasonable to have expected such.

11. At this point, I note that the grounds of application for permission to
    appeal seek to rely on regulation  8  as  an  extended  family  member.
    However, as Mr Collins conceded, this was not an issue  raised  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal and not the basis of the application. It is not for
    the judge to have to hunt through the regulations to find a  route  for
    granting a residence card. In the circumstances,  Mr  Collins  did  not
    pursue this issue and it does  not  form  part  of  the  error  of  law
    considerations.

12. However, Mr Collins submitted that in combination with the  second  DNA
    report, the judge should have accepted that it was demonstrated on  the
    balance of probabilities that the relationship  between  the  appellant
    and sponsor is as claimed. For the reasons set  out  below,  I  do  not
    accept that submission.

13. The Anglia DNA report which  was  put  before  Judge  Beach  but  which
    neither Mr Collins nor Ms Savage had seen  is  as  problematic  as  the
    Cellmark report. Anglia DNA is a sibling test between the appellant and
    her brother.  The conclusion of the report is that it  is  more  likely
    that  the  two  are  related  than  unrelated.  Related  simply   means
    biologically related, but the report does not conclude  that  they  are
    either half or full siblings. The tests suggest that it  is  956  times
    more likely that they are full siblings rather than unrelated, and  265
    times  more  likely  that  they  are  half  siblings  than   unrelated.
    "Therefore it is more likely that (the appellant and her  brother)  are
    related than unrelated. However we are unable to determine  the  nature
    of this relationship."

14. Being related to each other  does  not  greatly  assist.  They  may  be
    cousins, or half siblings, sharing their mother but not their father. I
    do not accept Mr Collins submission that by adding one  report  to  the
    other the probability that they are father and daughter is  necessarily
    increased. These reports do not suggest that. I am no expert in DNA and
    neither, I assume, is Judge Beach.  Once  again,  some  further  simple
    enquiry with each of the DNA companies might have assisted to determine
    the parameters of what could be established.

15. I find  that  in  the  circumstances,  Judge  Beach  was  right  to  be
    circumspect about these reports and to look, from ï¿½21 onwards,  to  see
    whether the other evidence adduced might assist in resolving the  issue
    on the balance of probabilities. It was probably incorrect of the judge
    to refer in that paragraph to "conclusive," as that is  not  the  test,
    but I am satisfied considering the decision as a whole that  the  judge
    did not lose sight of the correct burden and standard of proof.

16. In considering the further evidence, it in fact largely weighed against
    the appellant's case, as the sponsor denied that his name is  the  name
    of the father cited on the appellant's birth certificate,  even  though
    the  name  Rasheed  Oseni  is  the  same  name  as  used  in  the  visa
    application. As judge Beach noted, there is  no  explanation  for  this
    discrepancy.

17. In the  circumstances,  I  find  that  the  decision  to  dismiss  this
    appellant's appeal was properly made and one which the judge was  fully
    entitled to make, giving cogent reasons for doing so.  I  cannot  agree
    that the decision was perverse or irrational,  or  failed  to  properly
    consider the relevant evidence. It follows, therefore, that no error of
    law is disclosed.

18. It remains open to the appellant  to  make  a  fresh  application  with
    better  or  rather  more  coherent  evidence,  or  at   least   further
    clarification of the various DNA test results.

Conclusion & Decision:

19. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an anonymity order. Given the  circumstances,  I  make
no anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
