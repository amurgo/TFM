               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Arkhurst, Counsel, instructed by Howe & Co.

For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer



   1. A review of the jurisprudence  discloses  that  there  is  no  general
      proposition that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights
      can never be engaged when the family life it is sought to establish is
      between adult siblings living together. Rather than applying a blanket
      rule with regard to adult children, each case should  be  analysed  on
      its own facts, to decide whether or not family life exists, within the
      meaning of Article 8(1).  Whilst some  generalisations  are  possible,
      each case is fact-sensitive.


   2. The historic injustice and its consequences suffered by former members
      of the Brigade of Gurkhas are to be taken into account when  assessing
      proportionality under Article 8(2) but the 'historical wrong' was  not
      as severe as that  perpetrated  upon  British  Overseas  Citizens  and
      carries  substantially  less  weight.   Because  of  the   exceptional
      position of Gurkha veterans, and  their  families,  the  Secretary  of
      State has made special provision for their entry to the UK outside the
      Immigration Rules as an  acknowledgment  that  it  is  in  the  public
      interest to remedy the injustice.

   3. Given that the Gurkhas are Nepali  nationals,  it  is  not  inherently
      unfair or in breach of  their  human  rights  to  distinguish  between
      Gurkha veterans, their wives and minor children on the one  hand,  who
      will generally be given leave to remain, and  adult  children  on  the
      other,  who  will  only  be  given  leave  to  remain  in  exceptional
      circumstances. The scheme that the Secretary of State has developed is
      capable of addressing the historical wrong and contains  within  it  a
      flexibility that, in most cases, will avoid conspicuous unfairness.



            DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. The Appellant, who is a national of Nepal, has appealed against the
        decision of the First Tier Tribunal ('FTT') (Immigration Judge A.M.
        Black) which, on 14 September 2011, dismissed an appeal against the
        refusal of leave to remain as the dependant of a former  member  of
        the Brigade of Gurkhas.

     2. We heard this appeal on the same day as another appeal  because  it
        raised similar issues, and so our legal analysis  is  the  same  in
        both cases.

     3. The grounds of appeal were that  the  FTT  failed  to  give  proper
        consideration  to  the  application  of  Article  8  ECHR  to   the
        circumstances of the Appellant's case.   The Appellant, who is aged
        25, lives with his parents in the UK.  Since 2007, he has had leave
        to study in the UK.  His parents  both  have  Indefinite  Leave  to
        Remain ('ILR').

     4. Permission to appeal was given by FTT Judge Davey on  29  September
        2011.

     5. The Respondent did not oppose a finding that the Judge erred in law
        in her assessment of Article 8.

     6. On 8 December 2011, Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede  decided,  pursuant
        to rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,
        that the FTT had erred in law and therefore the decision should  be
        set aside and re-made by the Upper Tribunal.

        The decision of the Respondent

     7. The Appellant  applied  for  ILR  on  17  September  2010,  as  the
        dependant relative of his father, a person present and  settled  in
        the UK.

     8. The Respondent refused the application, in a letter dated  29  July
        2011, on the following grounds:

        a) The Appellant  was  25  years  old,  in  good  health,  and  had
           demonstrated that he could live independently from his  parents,
           and support himself.

        b) The Appellant did not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  paragraph
           317(i)(f) and (iii) of the  Immigration  Rules  as  he  had  not
           established that he would be living alone outside the UK in  the
           most exceptional compassionate circumstances  and  that  he  was
           financially wholly or mainly dependent on a relative present and
           settled in the UK.

        c)  Leave  may  be  granted  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,   in
           exceptional circumstances, pursuant to  Immigration  Directorate
           Instructions, Chapter 15, Section  2A,  paragraph  13.2.   There
           were no grounds to exercise this discretion  in  favour  of  the
           Appellant.

        d) Removal to  Nepal  would  not  interfere  with  the  Appellant's
           Article 8 rights.  He had not established an  interference  with
           family life within the meaning of Article 8(1), as there was  no
           dependency  going  beyond   normal   emotional   ties   in   his
           relationship with his parents.  Although he  had  established  a
           private  life,  any  interference  could  be  justified  in  the
           circumstances of his case.

        e) The Appellant had failed to establish grounds for  discretionary
           leave.



The decision of the FTT




     9. In a decision promulgated on 14 September 2011,  Immigration  Judge
        A.M. Black  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  on  the  following
        grounds:

        a) The Appellant rightly  conceded  that  he  did  not  fulfil  the
           requirements of paragraph 317 of the Immigration Rules;

        b) The Appellant had not established an  interference  with  family
           life within the meaning of Article 8, as his emotional ties were
           no more than the usual ties which a 25 year old student has with
           his parents.  He had lived apart from them for over 2 years.

        c) The Appellant had established a private life  in  the  UK  which
           encompassed his relationship with his parents  and  sisters,  as
           well as his social life and studies in the UK.

        d) Removal from the UK was proportionate to the aim of  immigration
           control.  The Appellant must have appreciated when  he  came  to
           the UK that he could have no expectation of settlement here.  He
           would be able to  maintain  his  relationship  with  family  and
           friends  from  Nepal  through  visits  and   modern   means   of
           communication.  He would probably fulfil the criteria for  leave
           to complete his studies in the UK.

        e) The applicable policy was the March 2010 version of the IDI,  at
           Annex  A  and  Section  13.2.,  which  gave  the  Respondent   a
           discretion to grant  leave  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  in
           'exceptional circumstances'.   It  was  for  the  Respondent  to
           exercise this discretion, and it was  not  possible  to  make  a
           finding that his decision in this case  was  not  in  accordance
           with the law.



Grounds of appeal



    10. The Appellant's grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal were:

        a) The Judge misapplied the relevant law  in  concluding  that  the
           Appellant did not have a family life with his parents, so as  to
           engage Article 8(1);

        b) The Judge  failed  to  consider  whether  the  severity  of  any
           interference with the Appellant's family life would be  such  as
           to engage Article 8.

        c)  Alternatively,  the  Judge  misapplied  the  relevant  law   by
           overstating the degree of severity required for Article 8 to  be
           engaged.

        d) In assessing proportionality, the  Judge  failed  to  take  into
           account  a  significant  factor,  namely,  the  righting  of  an
           historic wrong towards the Gurkhas.

    11. In the Upper Tribunal, the Appellant did not pursue the  ground  of
        appeal relied upon at the FTT,  namely,  that  the  Respondent  had
        failed  to  apply  its  discretionary  policy   lawfully   to   the
        Appellant's case.



Findings of fact



    12. The Appellant, whose date of birth is 16 July 1986, is now aged 25.
        He was born in Hong Kong in the British  Military  Hospital,  while
        his father was serving in the British Army.

    13. His father, Mr Lal Bahadur Ghising, is a national of Nepal, who was
        born on 23 November 1950.  He enlisted in the Brigade of Gurkhas on
        23 November 1968, serving in The Queen's Gurkha Engineers.  He  was
        posted to Singapore, Hong Kong, the UK, Brunei and Belize.

    14. Mr L. Ghising was discharged on 6 February  1992,  after  23  years
        service, on completion of his engagement. His rank on discharge was
        Warrant Officer Class 1. Mr L. Ghising's evidence was that  he  had
        served Britain with dedication and loyalty. His commanding  officer
        assessed his military conduct as 'Exemplary' and described  him  as
        'extremely  competent'  and  'extremely  hardworking,  honest   and
        loyal'.

    15.  Mr  L.  Ghising's  evidence,  which  was  not  challenged  by  the
        Respondent, was that he wished to settle in the UK soon  after  his
        discharge, but he was not permitted to do so, because at that  time
        Gurkhas who had served in the British Army were not given the  same
        rights to apply for settlement as other  foreign  and  Commonwealth
        nationals serving in the British Armed  Forces.   If  he  had  been
        permitted to  settle  in  the  UK  in  1991,  he  would  have  been
        accompanied by his wife, his daughter, and the Appellant, who would
        have been 6 years old. It was accepted by the Respondent  that,  if
        the Appellant had accompanied his father to the UK  whilst  he  was
        still a minor, he would have been given Indefinite Leave to  Remain
        ('ILR').

    16. From 2004 onwards, the  British  Government  began  to  revise  its
        stance towards Gurkha veterans. It was only  in  2009  that  Mr  L.
        Ghising became eligible to apply for entry.  He  did  so,  and  was
        granted indefinite leave to enter the UK on  4  August  2009.   His
        wife was granted indefinite leave to enter the UK on  16  September
        2009.    They arrived in the UK on 25 September 2009.

    17. In the meantime, in 2007, the Appellant came to the UK  from  Nepal
        to study.  He entered the UK on 14 January 2007 and was given leave
        to enter as a student until 31 December 2010. He has now  completed
        two courses in Business  Management  at  colleges  in  London.   In
        January 2012, he enrolled on an MBA course  at  the  University  of
        East London which concludes in June 2013.  If his parents  had  not
        settled in the UK, it is likely that, on completion of his studies,
        he would have returned to Nepal to live with his  parents,  as  his
        sister did.

    18. The Appellant  has  always  been  financially  dependant  upon  his
        parents. His father pays his tuition fees and supports him.

    19. Mr L. Ghising is self-employed, and  owns  a  manpower  consultancy
        business, which is now wholly based in the UK.  He  no  longer  has
        any business interests in Nepal.

    20. Since Mr and Mrs Ghising have been settled in the UK, the Appellant
        has been living with them.  Mr and Mrs Ghising now own a  house  in
        Abbey Wood, London SE2.

    21. We are satisfied on the evidence that the Appellant  has  a  close-
        knit family relationship with his parents.  They  value  and  enjoy
        each other's company on a daily basis.

    22. The Appellant  depends  upon  them  for  financial,  practical  and
        emotional support and guidance. They depend upon him as their  only
        child still living at home.  Mr L. Ghising's evidence was  that  it
        is the custom among Nepalese people for the youngest son to  remain
        living with his parents, even after marriage, to care for them when
        they become elderly.  This  evidence  was  not  challenged  by  the
        Respondent.

    23. Mr L. Ghising would like the Appellant to join him in his business,
        once he has completed his studies.   Mrs  Ghising  is  frail,  with
        serious health problems, and she relies on the  Appellant  to  look
        after her, and take her to a specialist clinic on a regular  basis,
        as her husband is away at work.

    24. The Appellant has one sister, Miss Jarina Ghising.  She was born on
        4 December 1978 in Nepal.  She came to study in  the  UK  and  then
        returned to live in Nepal. She is now married to a British citizen,
        and she was given ILR in the UK in July 2010. She  has  two  infant
        children, both of  whom  are  British  citizens.   Because  of  her
        childcare responsibilities, she cannot care for her mother.

    25. The majority of the Appellant's family, on his  father's  side,  is
        settled in the UK

    26. The Appellant has founded a life here, over the past 5  years,  and
        has friends and a social  network.   He  has  passed  the  required
        English language test and the Life in the  UK  test.  He  has  also
        passed his driving test.

    27. If the Appellant had to return to  Nepal,  his  parents  could  not
        return with him. His father's business  interests  require  him  to
        remain in the UK.  Furthermore, their  daughter  and  grandchildren
        are permanently based here, as well as most other family members.

    28. The Appellant has only one close relative in Nepal: his 87 year old
        grandfather who lives in  a  rural  village,  where  there  are  no
        suitable  educational  or  professional   opportunities   for   the
        Appellant.  The Appellant would have to find accommodation  on  his
        own in Kathmandu, and build a life there for  himself,  apart  from
        his nuclear family.



Immigration Rules



    29. Immigration Rules 276X - 276AC make provision for the  children  of
        Gurkha veterans, who are themselves eligible for  settlement  under
        Immigration Rules 276E - 276K, to apply for settlement in  the  UK,
        provided certain conditions are met:

        a) At least one  parent  (or  exceptionally  a  relative)  must  be
           present and settled in the UK;

        b) The child is under the age of 18;

        c) The child is not leading an independent life, is  unmarried  and
           is not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent family
           unit.

    30. Children aged 18 or over  are  expected  to  apply  for  ILR  under
        Immigration  Rule  317,  which  is  of  general  application.   The
        requirements include that they are "living alone outside the United
        Kingdom in the most  exceptional  compassionate  circumstances  and
        mainly dependent financially on relatives  settled  in  the  United
        Kingdom".

    31. It was common ground that the Appellant  could  not  bring  himself
        within rule 317 because he could not  establish  "most  exceptional
        compassionate circumstances".

Discretionary policies



    32. The current (March 2010) version of the  Immigration  Directorate's
        Instructions ('IDI') provides, at Chapter 15, Section 2A, Annex A:

             "Dependants

             Discretion will normally be exercised and  settlement  granted
             in line with the main applicant for spouses,  civil  partners,
             unmarried and same-sex partners and dependant  children  under
             the age of 18.

             Children over the age of 18 and other dependant relatives will
             not normally qualify for the exercise of  discretion  in  line
             with the main applicant and would be expected to  qualify  for
             leave to  enter  or  remain  in  the  UK  under  the  relevant
             provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  for  example   under
             paragraph 317, or under the provisions of  Article  8  of  the
             Human Rights Act.  For more  information  on  the  exceptional
             circumstances in which discretion may be exercised see Section
             13.2".

    33. Section 13.2 provides:

                "Dependants over the age of 18

             Dependants over the age of 18 of foreign and  Commonwealth  HM
             Forces members  (including  Gurkhas)  who  are  not  otherwise
             covered in this guidance would normally need  to  qualify  for
             settlement in  the  UK  under  a  specific  provision  of  the
             Immigration Rules.

             In exceptional circumstances discretion may  be  exercised  in
             individual       cases where the dependant is over the age  of
             18.

             However, settlement applications from dependants over the  age
             of 18 who are the children of serving foreign and Commonwealth
             HM  Forces  members   (including   Gurkhas)   who   meet   the
             requirements of a parent should normally be approved, provided
             the dependant has previously been  granted  limited  leave  to
             enter or remain in the UK as part of the family unit and  they
             wish to continue to reside and be educated in the UK."

    34. Prior to March 2010, the discretion to admit over-18 dependants was
        set out in more detail.  The June  2009  version  of  Section  13.2
        stated:

             "Dependants over the age of 18

             In exceptional circumstances discretion may  be  exercised  in
             individual cases where the dependant is over the  age  of  18.
             In assessing whether  settlement  in  the  UK  is  appropriate
             consideration should be given to the following factors:

              . one parent or a relative of the applicant  is  present  and
                settled or being admitted for, or being granted  settlement
                in the UK under the HM Forces rule;

              . the applicant has previously been granted limited leave  as
                a dependant of a member of HM Forces;

              . the applicant has been, and wishes to continue, pursuing  a
                full time course of study in the UK;

              . refusal of the application would mean  that  the  applicant
                would be living alone outside the  UK  and  is  financially
                dependant on the parent or relative present and settled, or
                being granted settlement in the  UK  under  the  HM  Forces
                rules;

              . the applicant would find  it  very  difficult  to  function
                because of  illness  or  disability  without  the  help  or
                support of their parent or close relative in the UK."

    35. We have also been shown earlier policies:

        a) Entry Clearance Guidance, Set 12, published on 25 June 2009; and

        b) Diplomatic Service Procedures - Entry Clearance,  updated  March
           2006.

    36. The relevant provision in both policies stated:

            "It is not the intention to split a family unit solely because a
            dependant  is  18  years  of  age  or  over.   Applications  for
            settlement from dependants who are 18 years of age or over  will
            be considered and discretion to  grant  settlement  outside  the
            Rules may be exercised  in  individual  cases....  In  assessing
            whether settlement in the UK is appropriate ECOs should consider
            the following factors:

            . one parent or a relative of  the  applicant  is  present  and
              settled, or being admitted for, or being granted,  settlement
              in the UK under the HM Forces rule;

            . the applicant has previously been granted limited leave as  a
              dependant of a member of HM Forces;

            . the applicant has been, and wishes to  continue,  pursuing  a
              full-time course of studies in the UK;

            . refusal of the application  would  mean  that  the  applicant
              would be living alone  outside  the  UK  and  is  financially
              dependent on the parent or relative present and  settled,  or
              being granted settlement in the UK under the HM Forces rule;

            . the applicant  would  find  it  very  difficult  to  function
              because of illness or disability without the help and support
              of their parent or close relative in the UK.

         If one or more of the factors listed above are present, the ECO may
         exercise discretion and grant entry clearance for settlement in the
         UK."

    37. The Court of Appeal considered these policies in UG (Nepal) & ors v
        Entry Clearance Officer [2012]  EWCA  Civ  58.  Tomlinson  LJ  said
        ([22]):

            "the opening sentence says no more than that the majority  of  a
           dependant is not of itself a bar to entry clearance. The  thrust
           of the policy is not however that dependants over the age of  18
           will be admitted.  The  thrust  of  the  policy  is  that  entry
           clearance may be granted to dependants over the age of 18  where
           settlement in the UK is appropriate."

         Tomlinson LJ agreed with the submission of the Secretary of  State
        that the policy required a rounded evaluation of the  circumstances
        in each case ([21]). The identified bullet points  were  "simply  a
        guide to the decision-maker" ([23]); "the approach was not to be  a
        mechanistic one of the "checklist" or "tick box" variety" ([21]).

    38. Confusingly, Set 12 continued to be accessible on the UKBA  website
        long after it had been superseded by the June 2009 IDI.   A  letter
        from the UKBA to Howe & Co, the  Appellant's  solicitors,  dated  4
        April 2011 explains:

             "The Set 12 document you refer to, which  forms  part  of  the
             Entry Clearance Guidance (ECG) was last revised and  published
             on 25 June 2009. It is  acknowledged that there was  a  period
             where the contents of the Set 12 document  you  have  provided
             contradicted  the  June  2009  and  March   2010   Immigration
             Directorate Instructions (IDI).   The  link  to  this  Set  12
             published on 25 June 2009 was deactivated on 24 July 2009  and
             users were directed to the correct  guidance.  An  unfortunate
             administrative error meant that both an  accurate  and  up  to
             date version of the guidance and the Set  12  which  you  have
             provided and which contained outdated and  incorrect  guidance
             were simultaneously available. This problem was identified  in
             September 2010 and the incorrect Set 12 document you refer  to
             was no longer  accessible  publicly  from  15  September  2010
             onwards.... UKBA provided a link to the  correct  guidance  on
             its website on 24 July 2009 which was readily available to all
             applicants, even though the historic version of  the  document
             remained available...Given this  availability  UKBA  considers
             that it is reasonable that any applications submitted after 24
             July 2009 should be  considered  in  line  with  this  correct
             guidance."

    39. In CT (Gurkhas: policy)  Nepal  [2011]  UKUT  53  (IAC)  the  Upper
        Tribunal held that, on a proper construction, the policy  known  as
        Set 12 only applied to applicants applying from outside the  United
        Kingdom.

    40. In our judgment, the policy applicable to  the  Appellant  was  the
        March 2010 IDI.  The Appellant  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
        remain on 17 September 2010 and his application was refused  on  29
        July 2011. Both events post-date the introduction of the March 2010
        IDI.   The Appellant did not seek  to  argue  before  us  that  the
        Respondent's refusal to find  'exceptional  circumstances'  in  the
        Appellant's case gave rise to a ground of appeal.   We  agree  with
        the conclusion of the FTT that the Tribunal could not properly find
        that the Respondent's exercise of discretion was 'not in accordance
        with the law', pursuant to s.86(3)   Nationality,  Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 2002.

        Article 8 ECHR

    41. By virtue of s. 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, it  is  unlawful
        for the Respondent to act in a way which  is  incompatible  with  a
        Convention right.

    42. Article 8 provides:

             "(1)      Everyone has the right to respect  for  his  private
             and family life, his home and his correspondence.

             (2) There shall be no interference by a public authority  with
             the exercise of this right except such as in  accordance  with
             the law and is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
             interests of national security, public safety or the  economic
             well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder  or
             crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or  for  the
             protection of the rights and freedoms of others."

    43. Our task in  this  appeal  is  to  decide  whether  the  challenged
        decision is incompatible with Article 8, based on up-to-date facts.
        It is not limited to reviewing the lawfulness of the  Secretary  of
        State's assessment of the Appellant's  Article  8  claim  (Huang  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007]  2  AC  167,  per
        Lord Bingham at [11], [13]).

    44. The principles to be applied are well-established.  In EB  (Kosovo)
        v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] 1 AC  1159,  at
        [7] Lord Bingham said:

             "In R (Razgar) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
             [2004] 2  AC  389,  para  17,  the  House  summarised  ...  the
             questions to be asked  by  an  adjudicator  hearing  an  appeal
             against removal on article 8 grounds. It said:

                  "In a case  where  removal  is  resisted  in  reliance  on
                  article 8, these questions are likely to be: (1) will  the
                  proposed removal be an interference by a public  authority
                  with the exercise of the applicant's right to respect  for
                  his private  or..  family  life?  (2)  If  so,  will  such
                  interference  have  consequences  of   such   gravity   as
                  potentially to engage the operation of article 8?  (3)  If
                  so, is such interference in accordance with the  law?  (4)
                  If so, is such  interference  necessary  in  a  democratic
                  society in the  interests  of  national  security,  public
                  safety or the economic well-being of the country, for  the
                  prevention of disorder or crime,  for  the  protection  of
                  health or morals, or for the protection of the rights  and
                  freedoms and others?  (5)  If  so,  is  such  interference
                  proportionate to the legitimate public end  sought  to  be
                  achieved?"

             In practice the fourth and fifth  questions  are  usually,  and
             unobjectionably taken together, but as expressed  they  reflect
             the approach of the Strasbourg court which is  (see  Boultif  v
             Switzerland (2001) 33 EHRR 1179,  para  46;  Mokrani  v  France
             (2003) 40 EHRR 123, para 27; Sezen v The Netherlands (2006)  43
             EHRR 621, para 41) that:

                  "decisions in this field, must, in  so  far  as  they  may
                  interfere with a right protected under  article  8(1),  be
                  shown to be necessary in a democratic society, that is  to
                  say,  justified  by  a  pressing  social  need,  and,   in
                  particular, proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."

    45. In Razgar Lord Bingham explained, at [20],  that  the  judgment  on
        proportionality:

                  "must always involve  the  striking  of  a  fair  balance
                  between the rights of the individual and the interests of
                  the community which is  inherent  in  the  whole  of  the
                  Convention.  The  severity  and   consequences   of   the
                  interference will call for  careful  assessment  at  this
                  stage."

    46. When considering the factors to take into account under Article  8,
        Lord Bingham said in Huang v The Secretary of State  for  the  Home
        Department [2007] 2 AC 167, at [18]:

                  "Human beings are social animals. They depend  on  others.
                  Their family, or extended family, is the  group  on  which
                  many people most heavily depend, socially, emotionally and
                  often financially.  There comes  a  point  at  which,  for
                  some, prolonged and unavoidable separation from this group
                  seriously  inhibits  their  ability  to  live   full   and
                  fulfilling lives. Matters such  as  the  age,  health  and
                  vulnerability of the applicant, the closeness and previous
                  history of the family, the applicant's dependence  on  the
                  financial  and  emotional  support  of  the  family,   the
                  prevailing  cultural  tradition  and  conditions  in   the
                  country of origin  and  many  other  factors  may  all  be
                  relevant."

    47. Lord Bingham concluded, at [20]:

                  "the  ultimate  question  for  the  appellate  immigration
                  authority is whether the refusal  of  leave  to  enter  or
                  remain, in circumstances where  the  life  of  the  family
                  cannot reasonably be expected  to  be  enjoyed  elsewhere,
                  taking full account  of  all  considerations  weighing  in
                  favour of the refusal, prejudices the family life  of  the
                  applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount to  a
                  breach of the fundamental right protected by article 8."

Article 8(1)

Family life



    48. The Appellant bears  the  burden  of  proof  of  establishing  that
        Article 8 is engaged.

    49. At the hearing before us, the Respondent's representative  conceded
        that the Appellant had established that he enjoyed family life with
        his parents, so as to engage Article 8.

    50. The ECtHR has established that, from birth, a child has a bond with
        his parents which  amounts  to  "family  life",  which  remains  in
        existence despite  voluntary  separation  (see  Sen  v  Netherlands
        (2003) 36 EHRR 7; (1996) Gul v Switzerland 22 EHRR 93).

    51. The question which arises in this case is at what  stage  does  the
        child/parent bond of family life come to  an  end?   When  does  an
        adult child cease to enjoy family life with his  parents,  for  the
        purposes of Article 8?

    52. The authority most frequently cited on this  point  is  Kugathas  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31.   We
        observe at the outset that the facts in  Kugathas  were  strikingly
        different from the facts in this case.  Mr Kugathas was a  national
        of Sri Lanka, aged about 38, who had  moved  to  Germany  with  his
        mother and siblings, as  refugees,  about  17  years  earlier.   Mr
        Kugathas had been living on his own in the UK for  about  3  years,
        and the only contact he had had with his family was one visit of  3
        weeks duration from his sister, her husband and child, and periodic
        telephone calls.  The Court of Appeal held that he  did  not  enjoy
        family life with his family  in  Germany,  within  the  meaning  of
        Article 8(1).

    53.  In  Kugathas,  at  [14],  Sedley  LJ  cited  with   approval   the
        Commission's observation in S v United Kingdom (1984) 40 DR 196:

             "Generally the protection  of  family  life  under  Article  8
             involves cohabiting dependents,  such  as  parents  and  their
             dependent,  minor  children.  Whether  it  extends  to   other
             relationships depends on the circumstances of  the  particular
             case. Relationships between adults, a mother and her  33  year
             old son in the present case, would not necessarily acquire the
             protection of Article 8 of the Convention without evidence  of
             further elements of dependency, involving more than the normal
             emotional ties."

    54. Sedley LJ accepted the submission that 'dependency' was not limited
        to economic dependency, at [17].  He added:

             "But if dependency is read down as meaning  "support"  in  the
             personal sense,  and  if  one  adds,  echoing  the  Strasbourg
             jurisprudence, "real" or "committed"  or  "effective"  to  the
             word "support", then it represents in my view the  irreducible
             minimum of what family life implies."

    55. Arden LJ said , at [24] - [25]:

             "24.      There is no presumption that a person has  a  family
             life, even with the members of a  person's  immediate  family.
             The court has to scrutinise the relevant factors. Such factors
             include  identifying  who  are  the  near  relatives  of   the
             appellant, the nature  of  the  links  between  them  and  the
             appellant, the age of the appellant, where and  with  whom  he
             has resided in the past, and  the  forms  of  contact  he  has
             maintained with the other members of the family with  whom  he
             claims to have a family life.

             25. Because there is no presumption  of  family  life,  in  my
             judgment a family life is not  established  between  an  adult
             child and  his  surviving  parent  or  other  siblings  unless
             something more exists than normal emotional ties...  Such  tie
             might exist if the appellant were dependent on his  family  or
             vice versa."

    56. We accepted  the  Appellant's  submission  that  the  judgments  in
        Kugathas  had been interpreted too restrictively in  the  past  and
        ought to be read in  the  light  of  subsequent  decisions  of  the
        domestic and Strasbourg courts.

    57. It has been recognised that family life may continue between parent
        and child even after the child has attained his majority: see Etti-
        Adegbola v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2009]  EWCA
        Civ 1319, per Pill LJ at [23]; per Arden LJ at [35].

    58. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v HK (Turkey)  [2010]
        EWCA Civ 583, the Court of Appeal (which included Sedley LJ in  its
        constitution) considered the judgments in Kugathas  and  Sir  Scott
        Baker said, at [16]:

             "In my judgment Mr Sachdeva is seeking to read more into these
             passages than  is  warranted  ...  it  is  apparent  that  the
             respondent had lived in the same house as  his  parents  since
             1994. He reached his majority in September 2005 but  continued
             to live at home. Undoubtedly he had family life while  he  was
             growing up and I would not regard it as suddenly cut off  when
             he reached his majority."

    59. In RP  (Zimbabwe)  &  Anor  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
        Department [2008] EWCA Civ 825, [6]  Sedley LJ  said  it  would  be
        'unreal' to dispute that the 23 year old appellant enjoyed   family
        life with her parents when she "had lived pretty well  continuously
        with her parents and siblings all her life".  The Court  of  Appeal
        also found the second appellant, who  was  25  years  old,  enjoyed
        family life  with  his  parents  since  he  was  "economically  and
        emotionally .. a member of his immediate family, all of whom - that
        is his parents and his two sisters  -  are  now  lawfully  resident
        here" (at [8]).

    60. Academic commentators on Strasbourg judgments  have  observed  that
        the Commission has been more cautious in its acceptance  of  family
        life between parents and adult children than the Court:  Clayton  &
        Tomlinson: The Law of Human Rights  2nd ed. (2009) paragraph 13.143
        -144; Liddy: The concept of family life  under  the  ECHR  European
        Human Rights Law Review 1998,1,  15-25.   Certainly,  some  of  the
        Court's decisions indicate that family life between adult  children
        and parents will readily be found, without evidence of  exceptional
        dependence. For example:

        a) Boughanemi v France (1996) 22 EHRR 228. The ECtHR held that  the
           deportation of a 34 year old man was an  interference  with  his
           family life with his parents and siblings although he no  longer
           lived with them.

        b) Bouchelkia v France (1998) 25 EHRR 686. The ECtHR  held  that  a
           deportation order interfered with the family life of a  20  year
           old man living with his parents and siblings.

        c) Kaya v Germany (Application no 31753/02). The ECtHR held that  a
           young adult who had lived with his parents until he was sent  to
           prison in 1999 still  enjoyed  family  life  with  them  on  his
           deportation in 2001, as he had kept in  touch  with  his  family
           through visits and letters.

    61. Recently, the ECtHR has reviewed the  case  law,  in  AA  v  United
        Kingdom (Application no 8000/08), finding that a significant factor
        will be whether or not the adult child has founded a family of  his
        own.  If he is still single and living  with  his  parents,  he  is
        likely to enjoy family life with them.  The Court said, at  [46]  -
        [49]:

             "46.      The Court recalls that in Bouchelkia  v  France,  29
             January 1997, � 41 Reports of Judgments and  Decisions   1997,
             when  considering  whether  there  was  an  interference  with
             Article 8 rights in a deportation case, it found that  "family
             life" existed in respect of an applicant who was 20 years  old
             and living with  his  mother,  step-father  and  siblings.  In
             Boujlifa v France, 21 October 1997, � 36, Reports 1997-VI, the
             Court  considered  that  there  was  "family  life"  where  an
             applicant aged 28 when deportation proceedings were  commenced
             against him had arrived in France  at  the  age  of  five  and
             received his schooling there,  had  lived  there  continuously
             with the exception of a period of imprisonment in  Switzerland
             and where his parents and siblings lived in France, In Maslov,
             cited above, � 62, the Court  recalled,  in  the  case  of  an
             applicant who had reached the age of majority by the time  the
             exclusion order became final but was living with his  parents,
             that  it  had  accepted  in  a  number  of  cases   that   the
             relationship between young adults who had not founded a family
             of their own and their parents or other close  family  members
             also constituted "family life".

             47. However, in two recent cases against  the  United  Kingdom
             the Court has declined to find "family life" between an  adult
             child and his parents. Thus in  Onur  v  United  Kingdom,  no.
             27319/07, � 43-45, 17 February 2009,the Court noted  that  the
             applicant, aged around  29  years  old  at  the  time  of  his
             deportation, had not demonstrated  the  additional  amount  of
             dependence  normally  required  to  establish  "family   life"
             between adult parents and  adult  children.  In  A.W.  Khan  v
             United Kingdom, no. 47486/06, � 32, 12 January 2010. the Court
             reiterated the need for additional elements of  dependence  in
             order to establish  family  life  between  parents  and  adult
             children and found that the 34 year old applicant in that case
             did not have "family  life"  with  his  mother  and  siblings,
             notwithstanding the fact that he was living with them and that
             they suffered a variety of different health problems.   It  is
             noteworthy, however, that  both  applicants  had  a  child  or
             children  of  their  own  following  relationships   of   some
             duration.

             48. Most recently, in Bousarra,  cited  above,  �  38-39,  the
             Court  found  "family  life"  to  be  established  in  a  case
             concerning a 24 year old applicant, noting that the  applicant
             was single and had no children and recalling that in the  case
             of young adults who had not yet founded  their  own  families,
             their ties with their parents and other close  family  members
             could constitute "family life".

             49. An examination of  the  Court's  case-law  would  tend  to
             suggest that the applicant, a young adult of 24 years old, who
             resides with his mother and has not yet founded  a  family  of
             his own can be regarded as having "family life". "

    62. The different outcomes in cases with superficially similar features
        emphasises to us that the issue under Article 8(1) is highly  fact-
        sensitive.  In our judgment, rather than applying  a  blanket  rule
        with regard to adult children, each case should be analysed on  its
        own facts, to decide whether or not family life exists, within  the
        meaning of Article 8(1). As Wall LJ explained, in  the  context  of
        family life between adult siblings:

             "We do not think that Advic is authority for  the  proposition
             that Article 8 of the Human Rights  Convention  can  never  be
             engaged when the family life it is sought to establish is that
             between adult siblings living together. In our  judgment,  the
             recognition in Advic that,  whilst  some  generalisations  are
             possible, each case is fact-sensitive places an obligation  on
             both Adjudicators and the IAT to identify the  nature  of  the
             family life  asserted,  and  to  explain,  quite  shortly  and
             succinctly, why it is that Article 8 is or is not engaged in a
             given case."  (Senthuran v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
             Department [2004] EWCA Civ 950).

    63. The relevant facts in  this  case  are  that  the  Appellant  is  a
        national of Nepal who is now aged 25.  He lived  with  his  parents
        all his life in Hong Kong and Nepal until 14 January 2007  when  he
        came to the UK from Nepal to study.  He  was given leave  to  enter
        as a student until 31 December 2010.

    64. If his parents had not settled in the UK, it  is  likely  that,  on
        completion of his studies, he would have returned to Nepal to  live
        with his parents, as his sister did.

    65. Although the UK Government allowed some Gurkha veterans  to  settle
        in the UK from October 2004, it was only from May 2009 that  Mr  L.
        Ghising became  eligible  to  apply  for  entry.   He  was  granted
        indefinite leave to enter the UK on 4 August 2009.   His  wife  was
        granted indefinite leave to enter the  UK  on  16  September  2009.
        They arrived in the UK on 25 September 2009.

    66. Since Mr and Mrs Ghising arrived in the UK, the Appellant has  been
        living with them.

    67. We are satisfied on the evidence that the  Appellant  has  a  close
        knit family relationship with his parents.  They  value  and  enjoy
        each other's company on a daily basis.

    68. We have found that the  Appellant  depends  upon  his  parents  for
        financial, practical  and  emotional  support  and  guidance.  They
        depend upon him as their only child still living at  home.   Mr  L.
        Ghising's evidence was that it is the custom among Nepalese  people
        for the youngest son to remain living with his parents, even  after
        marriage, to care for them when they become elderly.  This evidence
        was not challenged by the Respondent.

    69. Mr L. Ghising would like the Appellant to join him in his business,
        once he has completed his studies.

    70. Mrs Ghising is frail, with serious health problems, and she  relies
        on the Appellant to look after her, and take her  to  a  specialist
        clinic on a regular basis, as her husband is away at work.

    71. The Appellant  has  always  been  financially  dependant  upon  his
        parents. His father pays his tuition fees and supports him.

    72. In our judgment, the  evidence  as  at  the  date  of  the  hearing
        establishes that the Appellant and his parents  genuinely  enjoy  a
        close-knit family life, in which they value and  depend  upon  each
        other, for mutual support and  affection.   On  the  basis  of  the
        authorities we have cited  above,  this  is  sufficient  to  engage
        Article 8.  Although their family life was  interrupted  when   the
        Appellant  came  to  the  UK  to  study,  the  Appellant   remained
        financially and emotionally dependent upon his parents during  that
        period, and their normal family life resumed as soon as his parents
        were able to settle in the UK.



Private life



    73. The Judge found that the Appellant had a private  life  in  the  UK
        which encompassed his relationship with  his  parents,  sister  and
        extended family, as well as his social life and studies.  Thus far,
        we agree with her findings.

    74. The Judge then went on to conclude that the consequences of removal
        were not so grave as to engage Article  8.  The  Appellant  submits
        that, at this stage, she  misinterpreted  the  second  question  in
        Razgar, namely, "will such interference have consequences  of  such
        gravity as potentially to engage the operation of article 8?"

    75. The Court of Appeal explained in AG (Eritrea) v Secretary of  State
        for the Home Department  [2007] EWCA Civ  80,  per  Sedley  LJ,  at
        [28]:

             "while an interference with private or  family  life  must  be
             real if it is to engage art. 8(1), the threshold of engagement
             (the "minimum level") is not a specially high one."

         In R (Aguilar Quila) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
         [2011] 3 WLR 836, at [30], Lord Wilson cited this passage  from  AG
         (Eritrea) with approval.

    76.  In our judgment,  the  Judge  did  err  in  applying  too  high  a
        threshold of engagement for Article 8.  On a proper application  of
        the legal test, the consequences  of  removal  in  this  case  were
        clearly sufficiently serious to engage Article 8, as the  Appellant
        would be permanently separated from his family and friends, once he
        had completed his studies in the UK.   The Respondent did not  seek
        to defend the Judge's conclusion on this issue.

Article 8(2)



    77. Once the Appellant has established that Article 8 is  engaged,  the
        Respondent bears the burden of proving  that  the  interference  is
        justified under Article 8(2).

In accordance with the law



    78. The Appellant does not dispute that  the  Respondent  can  lawfully
        refuse  leave  to  remain,  and  therefore  his  decision  is   'in
        accordance with the law', within the meaning of Article 8(2).

Legitimate aim



    79. It is common ground that the  Respondent's  policy  of  immigration
        control is "a legitimate aim 'in the interests of the economic well
        being of the country' " (per Lady Hale in Razgar at [45]).

    80. The public interest in  a  firm  and  fair  system  of  immigration
        control is considerable. In EB  (Kosovo)   Lord  Bingham  said,  at
        [10]:

             "10.      In Huang  [2007]  2  AC  167,  para  16,  the  House
             acknowledged the need, in almost any case, to give  weight  to
             the established regime of immigration control:

             "The authority will wish to consider and weigh all that  tells
             in favour of the refusal of leave which  is  challenged,  with
             particular reference  to  justification  under  article  8(2).
             There  will,  in  almost  any   case,   be   certain   general
             considerations to bear in  mind:  the  general  administrative
             desirability  of  applying  known  rules  if   a   system   of
             immigration control is to be workable, predictable, consistent
             and fair as between one applicant and another; the  damage  to
             good administration and  effective  control  if  a  system  is
             perceived by applicants internationally to be  unduly  porous,
             unpredictable or perfunctory;  the  need  to  discourage  non-
             nationals admitted to the country temporarily  from  believing
             that they can commit serious crimes  and  yet  be  allowed  to
             remain; the need to discourage fraud, deception and deliberate
             breaches of the law; and so on."

             There was of course nothing novel in  this.  In  R(Mahmood)  v
             Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 1  WLR  840,
             para 23, Laws LJ had recognised that "Firm immigration control
             requires  consistency  of  treatment  between   one   aspiring
             immigrant and another". In a  complex  and  overloaded  system
             perfect equality of  treatment  between  applicants  similarly
             placed  will  be  impossible   to   achieve,   but   startling
             differences of treatment between such applicants, or  anything
             suggestive of randomness or caprice  in  decision-making  must
             necessarily give grounds for concern."



Historic injustice

    81. In this appeal,  the  Appellant  submits  that  the  importance  of
        upholding a firm and consistent  immigration  policy  carries  less
        weight because it has to be balanced against the  recognition  that
        the Government's past  immigration  policy  in  respect  of  Gurkha
        veterans and their families was unjust.  Mr L. Ghising should  have
        been able to apply for settlement in the UK  after  discharge  from
        the Gurkha Brigade in 1991,  and  the  Appellant  would  have  been
        entitled to enter the UK with him, as a 6 year old dependant child,
        and  remained  in  the  UK  upon  attaining  his  majority.   Thus,
        settlement in the UK would not have resulted in the  separation  of
        the family.

    82. The Appellant relies upon the  decision  of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
        McKee in Entry Clearance Officer, New Delhi v KG  [2011]  UKUT  117
        (IAC), a case concerning an adult dependant of a Gurkha veteran, in
        which he held that the public interest in maintaining firm and fair
        immigration control was not as  strong  as  usual  because  of  the
        existence of a policy outside the Immigration Rules  providing  for
        admission of those such as the appellant, and because the appellant
        could have come to the UK as a minor if  Gurkha  veterans  had  not
        been wrongly prevented from settling here at an earlier date.

    83. Judge McKee relied upon the judgment of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
        Entry Clearance Officer, Mumbai v NH (India) [2007] EWCA Civ  1330,
        which held that the refusal of entry clearance to the  adult  child
        of a Kenyan  citizen of the United Kingdom  and  Colonies  breached
        Article 8(2) as  "but  for  a  historic  injustice  which  was  now
        acknowledged, the mother would have been able as of right to  bring
        her youngest son here with her years ago" (per Sedley LJ at [37]).

    84. This principle was  acknowledged  in  JB  (India)  &  Ors  v  Entry
        Clearance Officer [2009] EWCA Civ 234,  which  concerned  the  same
        "historical wrong" which had deprived the sponsor  of  a  right  of
        abode in the UK by legislation which had been  acknowledged  to  be
        racially discriminatory  and  then  further  discriminated  against
        because married women were not eligible  under  the  special  quota
        voucher scheme unless their husbands were  incapacitated.  Sullivan
        LJ said, at [20]:

             "The decisions in NH and RO are authority for the  proposition
             that,  where  there  is  an  interference  with  family   life
             sufficient to engage Article 8(1), recognition that the family
             has been the victim of a  "historic  injustice"  may  well  be
             relevant,   in  some   cases   highly   relevant,   when   the
             proportionality  of  that  interference  is  considered  under
             Article 8(2)."

    85. In Patel, Modha & Odedra v Entry Clearance Officer [2010] EWCA  Civ
        17,  which  also  concerned  the  treatment  of  British   Overseas
        Citizens, Sedley LJ distinguished between  the  position  of  adult
        children who no longer enjoyed family life with their parents,  and
        those who did:

             "14.      You can set  out  to  compensate  for  a  historical
             wrong, but you cannot reverse the passage  of  time.  Many  of
             these children have now grown up  and  embarked  on  lives  of
             their own. Where this has happened, the bonds which constitute
             family life will no longer be there and art. 8  will  have  no
             purchase. But what may constitute an extant family life  falls
             well short of what constitutes dependency,  and  a  good  many
             adult children  -  including  children  on  whom  the  parents
             themselves are now reliant - may still have a family life with
             parents who are now settled here not by leave or by  force  of
             circumstances but by long-delayed right. That  is  what  gives
             the historical wrong a potential relevance to  art.  8  claims
             such as these. It does not make the Convention a mechanism for
             turning the clock back, but it does make both the history  and
             its  admitted   injustices   potentially   relevant   to   the
             application of art. 8(2).

             15. ... the effect of this is to reverse the usual balance  of
             art. 8 issues. By the time they come to seek entry  clearance,
             adult children may well no longer be part of the  family  life
             of British overseas citizens who have finally secured  British
             citizenship. If so, the threshold of art. 8(1) will not be  an
             issue. If, however, they come within the  protection  of  art.
             8(1), the balance of factors determining  proportionality  for
             the  purposes  of  art.  8(2)  will  be  influenced,   perhaps
             decisively, by the fact (if it is a fact) that,  but  for  the
             history recounted in NH (India), the  family  would  or  might
             have settled here long ago."

    86. In considering the position of Gurkhas and their families, we  have
        drawn upon the account given by Blake  J  in  R  (Limbu  &  Ors)  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department & Ors [2008]  EWHC  2261
        (Admin), of  the Respondent's immigration policies  towards  Gurkha
        veterans.

    87. For many years, Gurkha veterans were treated less  favourably  than
        other comparable non-British soldiers serving in the  British  army
        i.e. Commonwealth citizens. Even though Commonwealth citizens  were
        subject to immigration control, the Home Office had a concessionary
        policy outside the Immigration  Rules  which  allowed  serving  and
        former members of the British armed  forces  to  obtain  indefinite
        leave to remain on discharge in the UK. Gurkhas were  not  included
        within this policy, and they had no entitlement to  settle  in  the
        UK.

    88.  Eventually,  the  British  Government  bowed   to   pressure   and
        acknowledged the need to change its  policy.   The  Home  Secretary
        issued a press release in 2004 which stated:

              "Throughout their history, the men of the Gurkha Brigade  have
             shown unquestioning loyalty to the Queen and the people of the
             United Kingdom. In battle they have  distinguished  themselves
             as brave and  skilful  soldiers  in  all  conditions  and  all
             terrains. Their 13 Victoria Crosses and numerous other bravery
             awards speak for themselves. I am very keen to ensure that  we
             recognise their role in the history of  our  country  and  the
             part they have played in protecting us.  This is why  we  have
             put together the best possible package  to  enable  discharged
             Gurkhas to apply for settlement and citizenship. I  hope  that
             the decision I have made today will make our gratitude  clear.
             Those high military standards  have  been  mirrored  by  their
             demeanour in civilian life.  Their  families  too  have  shown
             devotion and commitment by  travelling  across  continents  to
             support the Brigade."

    89. From 22 October 2004, newly introduced  Immigration  Rules  276E  -
        276K enabled Gurkha veterans with at least 4 years service, and who
        had been discharged from the  armed  forces  within  the  past  two
        years, to apply for settlement in the UK.   However,  only  Gurkhas
        discharged after 1 July 1997 were eligible to apply.  The rationale
        for this restriction was that, in July 1997, the Brigade of Gurkhas
        moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to the UK, and so after  that
        date Gurkhas would  have  had  the  opportunity  to  develop  close
        physical ties with the UK.

    90. At the same time, the Secretary of State  adopted  a  discretionary
        policy under which Gurkhas would be permitted to settle in  the  UK
        even if they had been discharged prior to 1 July 1997  and/or  more
        than 2 years prior to the date of application, if there were strong
        reasons why settlement in the UK was appropriate in the  particular
        case, because of existing ties with the UK.

    91. The restriction on entry for Gurkhas discharged prior to  1997  was
        the subject of the 2008 judicial review in Limbu, in which Blake J.
        criticised elements of the policy and  the  instructions  to  Entry
        Clearance Officers.

    92. In May 2009, the Secretary of State announced that any Gurkha  with
        more than 4 years service who had been discharged from the  Brigade
        of Gurkhas before 1 July 1997 would be eligible for  settlement  in
        the UK, under the terms of a discretionary policy set  out  in  the
        IDI, Chapter 15. Section 2A, Annex A.  As set out above, the policy
        permitted the spouse and minor  children  of  eligible  Gurkhas  to
        settle in the UK also, but only allowed adult children to settle on
        a discretionary basis.

    93. On the basis of this history, we consider that we  ought  to  apply
        the principle which the Court of Appeal has developed in the  cases
        concerning British Overseas Citizens,  namely,  that  the  historic
        injustice and its consequences are to be taken  into  account  when
        assessing  proportionality  under  Article  8(2).  Indeed,  at  the
        hearing of this appeal, the Respondent did not dispute  that  there
        had been an historic injustice perpetrated towards  Gurkhas,  which
        ought to be taken into  account  in  the  Article  8(2)  assessment
        (although Mr Bramble did  not  concede  that  the  outcome  of  the
        assessment would be that removal  would  be  a  breach  of  Article
        8(2)).

    94. However, it is important to bear in mind that there are significant
        differences between the position of Gurkhas and  that  of   British
        Overseas Citizens.  Gurkhas were citizens of  Nepal,  not  the  UK.
        They were not entitled as of right to live in  the  UK.   Moreover,
        the exclusion  of  British  Overseas  Citizens  has  been  formally
        recognised as racially  and  sexually  discriminatory,  unlike  the
        policy excluding Gurkhas.  We therefore agree with  the  conclusion
        of Judge McKee in KG  that the 'historical wrong' perpetrated  upon
        Gurkhas was  not  as  severe  as  that   perpetrated  upon  British
        Overseas Citizens.  In our  view,  it  carries  substantially  less
        weight.




   The position of the Appellant

    95. We consider that the following factors have to be  weighed  in  the
        balance as part of the Article 8(2) assessment.

    96. The Appellant's links with the UK are that he was born on  16  July
        1986 in the British Military Hospital in Hong Kong, at that time  a
        British Colony, where his father was serving with the British Army.
           He has been educated in the UK since 2007, and his  studies  are
        due to continue until 2013.

    97. He is a national of Nepal, and grew up in Nepal after his  father's
        discharge in 1991.  He entered the UK on a student visa of  limited
        duration, without the expectation  of  settling  here  permanently.
        He could probably obtain a further student visa to  enable  him  to
        complete his current course in early 2013.

    98.  We  have  found  that  the  Appellant  has  a  close-knit   family
        relationship with his parents. They value and  enjoy  each  other's
        company on a daily basis.

    99. They have always lived together,  apart  from  the  period  between
        January 2007 and September 2009, when the Appellant came to the  UK
        to complete his studies.   We have found that, if his  parents  had
        not come to the UK in 2009, it is probable that the Appellant would
        have returned to live with them  in  Nepal  on  completion  of  his
        studies.  The undisputed evidence is that it is the custom in Nepal
        for the youngest son to remain at home to care for the parents.

   100. The Appellant depends upon his parents for financial, practical and
        emotional support and guidance.    His father pays his tuition fees
        and supports him.

   101. Mr L. Ghising would like the Appellant to join him in his business,
        once he has completed his studies.

   102. Mrs Ghising is frail, with serious health problems, and she  relies
        on the Appellant to look after her, and take her  to  a  specialist
        clinic on a regular basis, as her husband is away at work.

   103. The Appellant has one sister, Miss Jarina Ghising.  She was born on
        4 December 1978 in Nepal.  She came to study in  the  UK  and  then
        returned to live in Nepal. She is now married to a British citizen,
        and she was given ILR in the UK in July 2010. She  has  two  infant
        children, both of  whom  are  British  citizens.   Because  of  her
        childcare responsibilities, she cannot care for her mother.

   104. The majority of the Appellant's family, on his  father's  side,  is
        settled in the UK

   105. The Appellant has founded a life here, over the past 5  years,  and
        has friends and a social  network.   He  has  passed  the  required
        English language test and the Life in the  UK  test.  He  has  also
        passed his driving test.

   106. If the Appellant had to return to  Nepal,  his  parents  could  not
        return with him. His father's business  interests  require  him  to
        remain in the UK.  Furthermore, their  daughter  and  grandchildren
        are permanently based here, as well as most other family members.

   107. The Appellant has only one close relative in Nepal; his 87 year old
        grandfather who lives in  a  rural  village,  where  there  are  no
        suitable  educational  or  professional   opportunities   for   the
        Appellant.  The Appellant would have to find accommodation  on  his
        own in Kathmandu, and build a life there for himself  on  his  own.
        The opportunities to visit his parents  and  his  sister,  and  her
        children, would be limited because of the long distances involved.



The position of other family members

   108. There is clear authority for the proposition that we must  consider
        the family unit as a whole,  and  the  impact  of  the  Appellant's
        removal upon his parents.

   109. In Beoku-Betts v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2009]
        AC 115, the House of Lords held that both the  Secretary  of  State
        and the immigration  appellate  authorities  had  to  consider  the
        rights to respect for their family life of all the  family  members
        who might be affected by the decision and not  just  those  of  the
        claimant or appellant in question. Lord Brown said, at [20]:

             "Together these members enjoy a single family life and whether
             or not the removal would interfere disproportionately with  it
             has to be looked at by reference to the family unit as a whole
             and the impact of removal upon each  member.  If  overall  the
             removal would be disproportionate, all affected family members
             are to be regarded as victims."

   110. In the same case Lady Hale said, at [4]:

             "To insist that  an  appeal  to  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
             Tribunal consider only the effect upon other family members as
             it affects the appellant, and that a judicial  review  brought
             by other family members considers only  the  effect  upon  the
             appellant as it affects  them,  is  not  only  artificial  and
             impracticable. It also risks missing the central  point  about
             family life, which is that the whole is greater than  the  sum
             of its individual parts. The right to respect for  the  family
             life of one necessarily encompasses the right to  respect  for
             the  family  life  of  others,  normally  a  spouse  or  minor
             children, with whom that family life is enjoyed."

   111. In ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
        [2011] 2 AC 166, Lady Hale cited her judgment in the Privy  Council
        case of  Naidike v Attorney-General of Trinidad and Tobago [2005] 1
        AC 538, where she said, at [75]:

             "The  decision-maker  has  to  balance  the  reason  for   the
             expulsion  against  the  impact  upon  other  family  members,
             including any alternative means of preserving family ties. The
             reason for deporting may  be  comparatively  weak,  while  the
             impact on the rest of the family, either of being left  behind
             or of being forced to leave their own country, may be  severe.
             On the other hand,  the  reason  for  deporting  may  be  very
             strong, or it may be entirely reasonable to expect  the  other
             family members to leave with the person deported."

   112. Applying these principles  to  this  case,  we  consider  that  the
        following factors have to be weighed in the balance:

        a) The Appellant has a close- knit  family  relationship  with  his
           parents, and they value and enjoy  each  other's  company  on  a
           daily basis.

        b) Mr and Mrs Ghising depend upon him as  their  only  child  still
           living at home.  Their  only  other  child  is  married  with  a
           husband and children to care for. Mr  L.  Ghising's  uncontested
           evidence was that it is the custom among Nepalese people for the
           youngest son to remain  living  with  his  parents,  even  after
           marriage, to care for them when they become elderly.

        c) On the  other  hand,  Mr  and  Mrs  Ghising  and  the  Appellant
           voluntarily lived apart, in different countries, for a period of
           2 years 8 months when he left home in Nepal in  2007  to  pursue
           his studies in the UK.

        d) Mr L. Ghising would like  the  Appellant  to  join  him  in  his
           business, once he has completed his studies.

        e) Mrs Ghising is frail, with  serious  health  problems,  and  she
           relies on the Appellant to look after her, and  take  her  to  a
           specialist clinic on a regular basis, as her husband is away  at
           work.

        f) It would not be reasonable to  expect  Mr  and  Mrs  Ghising  to
           resume family life with the Appellant in Nepal because:

              i) they have been granted ILR in the UK, on the  basis  of  Mr
                 Ghising's service in the Gurkha Brigade, and the  Secretary
                 of State has therefore accepted that their future life will
                 be in this country;

             ii) they have wanted to  settle  here  since  Mr  L.  Ghising's
                 discharge from the Gurkhas in 1991;

            iii) they have bought a home here and no longer have a  home  in
                 Nepal;

             iv) Mr Ghising has transferred all his business  operations  to
                 the UK and no longer has any business interests in Nepal;

              v) their daughter is settled in  the  UK  and  has  two  small
                 infants who are British citizens;  naturally,  Mr  and  Mrs
                 Ghising do not want to leave their grandchildren;

             vi) most of Mr Ghising's family members are settled in the UK.

        g) At the time Mr and Mrs Ghising decided to move to  the  UK,  the
           position was that the Respondent had a discretion to grant their
           son ILR under the relevant policy, and he fulfilled three of the
           factors listed in the June 2009 IDI guidance. These were (1) his
           parents had been admitted for settlement; (2) he has  been,  and
           wishes to continue, pursuing a full time course of study in  the
           UK; (3) refusal of the application would mean that the applicant
           would be  living  alone  outside  the  UK  and  was  financially
           dependent on the  parents  settled  in  the  UK.   The  previous
           guidance (Diplomatic  Service  Procedures  and  Entry  Clearance
           Guidance, Set 12) was in  similar  terms,  but  began  with  the
           reassuring words "It is not the  intention  to  split  a  family
           solely because a dependant is 18 years of age or over."

        h) On the basis of this information, Mr and Mrs Ghising would  have
           had a reasonable expectation that the Appellant would be granted
           leave to remain,   but equally they should have been aware  that
           there was no guarantee that his application would be successful.



Conclusion



   113. Our conclusion is that the removal of the Appellant to  Nepal  will
        severely interfere with his family life, and the family life of his
        parents, Mr and Mrs Ghising.  It is not reasonable to expect Mr and
        Mrs Ghising to return to Nepal.   The distance between the  UK  and
        Nepal means that the scope  for  family  visits  will  be  limited.
        Although his sister and her family are no longer part of his family
        unit, for the purposes of Article 8, his separation from them  will
        constitute an interference with his private life.

   114. We have found that Mr L. Ghising wished to settle in the  UK  after
        discharge from the Gurkha Brigade in 1991.  If  the  same  approach
        had been taken to Gurkha veterans as to other  non-British  members
        of the armed forces, leave  to  remain  would  probably  have  been
        granted.  The Appellant would have been entitled to  enter  the  UK
        with  him,  as  a  dependant  child  been  granted  ILR.  In  these
        circumstances, settlement in the UK by Mr and Mrs Ghising would not
        have resulted in the separation of the family and there would  have
        been no interference with the right  to  family  and  private  life
        under Article 8.

   115. In the light of these findings, we have asked ourselves whether the
        removal of the Appellant is necessary in a democratic society, that
        is to say, whether it is justified by a pressing  social  need  and
        proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.

   116. In our judgment, removal is justified and proportionate because  of
        the public interest in a firm and  consistent  immigration  policy.
        Because of the exceptional position of Gurkha veterans,  and  their
        families, the Respondent has made special provision for their entry
        to the UK outside the Immigration Rules, long  after  the  date  of
        their discharge from the armed forces.   This is an  acknowledgment
        that it is in the public interest to remedy an  historic  injustice
        in the UK Government's previous treatment of Gurkha veterans.

   117. The Respondent has distinguished  between  Gurkha  veterans,  their
        wives and minor children on the one hand,  who  will  generally  be
        given leave to remain, and adult children on the  other,  who  will
        only be given leave to remain in exceptional circumstances.   Given
        that the Gurkhas are  Nepali  nationals,  this  is  not  inherently
        unfair or in breach of human  rights.   As  Lord  Bingham  said  in
        Huang, at [6], a line has to be drawn somewhere.

   118.  In  considering  a  claim  of  'exceptional  circumstances',   the
        Respondent can, and  should, take into account  the  fact  that  an
        adult dependant, such as the Appellant, would  have  been  able  to
        enter the UK as a minor if his father had been given leave to enter
        at the appropriate time, shortly after discharge.

   119. The scheme that the Respondent has developed is, therefore, capable
        of addressing  the  historical  wrong  and  contains  within  it  a
        flexibility that, in most cases, will avoid conspicuous unfairness.
        Furthermore, although not an Immigration Rule, the Respondent could
        not properly fail to adopt the obligation set out in paragraph 2 of
        the rules, namely, that decision-makers within the Home Office  and
        UKBA  should  perform  their  duties  so  as  to  comply  with  the
        provisions of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998,  in  particular,  the
        judicious recognition of exceptional circumstances in the  case  of
        an adult dependant.

   120. Notwithstanding this, the ambit of Article 8 is  not  circumscribed
        and, as  stated  in  paragraphs  93  and  94  above,  the  historic
        injustice and its consequences must  be  taken  into  account  when
        assessing  proportionality  as  reducing  the  importance  normally
        attached to immigration control. Nevertheless, for the  reasons  we
        have given in paragraphs 93 and 94, as well as what we have said in
        paragraph  113  and  following,  its  impact  is  limited.  In  the
        circumstances of the present case,  taken  together,  it  does  not
        cause the balance to operate in favour of this Appellant leading us
        to conclude that removal is disproportionate.

   121. Since the Respondent  has  provided  a  scheme  for  remedying  the
        historic injustice in appropriate cases, there is a  strong  public
        interest in ensuring that the entry of Gurkha  veterans  and  their
        families is decided fairly and consistently in accordance with  the
        scheme.

   122. We find, therefore, that  the  Respondent's  refusal  of  leave  to
        remain is not a breach of the  Appellant's  right  to  family  life
        under Article 8.



            DECISION

   123. The Immigration Judge made an error on a point of law  and  we  re-
        make the decision and dismiss the appeal.
