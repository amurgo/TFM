Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, Ms Natasia Desiree Daley, date of  birth  13th  December
    1997 is a citizen of Jamaica.  Whilst at the time  of  the  application
    the appellant was a minor,  the  appellant  is  now  an  adult.  Having
    considered all  the  circumstances  I  am  satisfied  that  it  is  not
    necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Talbot promulgated on 29th December  2015,  whereby  the
    judge dismissed the appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent to refuse her entry clearance to the UK  as  a  child  of  a
    person  present  and  settled  in  the  UK  under  paragraph  297  (i).
    Specifically in issue in the case were sub-paragraphs 297 (e)  and  (f)
    of the Immigration Rules.

 3. By a decision taken on 29th June 2016 Tribunal  Judge  Brunnen  granted
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  Thus the  matter  appeared
    before me to determine in the first instance whether or not  there  was
    an error in law in the original determination.

    Error of law


 4. The appeal was heard on the 18th December 2015. Notice of  Hearing  had
    been  sent  out  to   the   appellant   and   the   appellant's   legal
    representatives on the 17th November 2015. At a time when the appellant
    would have been a minor. The address for the service of  the  appellant
    was given as the address of the appellant's legal representatives. Thus
    the  appellant  herself  was  not  served  save   through   her   legal
    representatives.

 5. According to the grounds  of  appeal  neither  the  appellant  nor  the
    appellant's representative received the Notice of Hearing.  I  note  in
    the decision by Judge Talbot there is reference to the fact that on the
    day of the hearing the court clerk telephoned the solicitors'  firm  on
    record and spoke to a member of the firm.  It  is  unclear  as  to  the
    status of the individual spoken to but  it  is  clear  that  they  were
    unable to give any explanation as to why no one was  in  attendance  at
    the hearing.

 6. The permission to appeal  makes  the  point  that  evidence  should  be
    submitted to establish that the solicitors did not receive  the  Notice
    of Hearing.

 7. In a sense it is unfortunate  that  the  address  for  service  of  the
    appellant and the representatives is one and the same address. It seems
    strange however that both letters have gone astray. There is  a  record
    on the court file to indicate that the notices were sent  out  both  to
    the  appellant  at  the  solicitors  address  and  to  the   solicitors
    themselves at that address.

 8. It is to be noted that despite the  fact  that  the  sponsor  had  been
    identified in the appeal documentation and her address given, no notice
    of hearing was sent to the sponsor. Whilst there is no  requirement  to
    do so under the Procedure Rules it may have been  helpful  had  noticed
    been sent to the sponsor. The sponsor and the  representative  were  in
    attendance before me.

 9. As set out above on the day of the hearing the  court  clerk  contacted
    the solicitors and no explanation was forthcoming as to why  there  was
    no one in attendance at the hearing. No information of significance was
    given. At the least the solicitor or clerk could have checked the  file
    and established why no one was in attendance and if necessary requested
    that the case be adjourned.

10. In any event taking all the matters  into  account  whether  it  be  by
    reason of administrative error either within the First-tier Tribunal or
    at the solicitors, I am willing to accept that the  appellant  has  not
    received notice of  hearing.  I  find  that  that  is  an  error  which
    constitutes in the circumstances an error of law. I do not  think  that
    there can be any criticism of the judge as he would have  been  unaware
    of such. The judge  took  reasonable  steps  to  seek  to  contact  the
    representatives to check why there was no attendance. Clearly  a  clerk
    at the solicitors' offices should have been able to give a reason as to
    why there was no attendance but appears not to have done so.

11. I would note that the grounds of appeal make reference to Article 6 and
    the right to a fair trial. I would however point out that the  European
    Court of Human Rights has held that the Article 6 Right of a Fair Trial
    does not apply to decisions about the entry and residence of aliens nor
    to what are termed administrative discretions as opposed to private law
    rights. [see cases such  as  Agee  v  UK  (1976)  7  DR  164;  P  v  UK
    (Application 13162/87) (1987) 54 DR 211; Uppal v UK (1980) 3 EHRR  391;
    and Maaouia v France (2000) 33EHRR 1047.  That  finds  support  in  the
    cases of RB (Algeria)v SSHD [2009]  UKHL  10  when  it  was  held  that
    Article 6 did not apply  to  deportation;  R  (on  the  application  of
    Hussain) v SSHD 2010 EWCA Civ 115.]. To an extent therefore the grounds
    of appeal themselves seem to be misconceived.

12. That does not however alter the fact that as identified  in  the  leave
    application, if the appellant did not receive notice of  hearing,  that
    is a procedural error capable of constituting an error of  law.  Having
    determined that the appellant did not receive  notice  of  hearing  and
    taking all the circumstances into  account  I  find  that  there  is  a
    procedural error amounting to an error  of  law.  I  set  the  decision
    aside.

13. I thereafter considered how best to deal with the matter and determined
    to proceed by re-hearing the matter.

    Nature of the appeal


14. As stated this is an application by the appellant for  entry  clearance
    to the United Kingdom as the child of a person present and  settled  in
    the United Kingdom under paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules. Whilst
    the appellant was by the time of the decision over 18, at the  time  of
    the application, 2nd July 2014, the appellant was a minor and  entitled
    to take advantage of paragraph 27 of the Immigration Rules, whereby the
    application has to be considered  on  the  basis  of  the  age  of  the
    appellant at the date of the application.

15. The burden of proof is  on  the  appellant  prove  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that she meets all of the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules.

16. It appears that all the requirements of the rules  were  met  save  for
    paragraphs 297(i) (e) alternatively (f). Under the rules the issue left
    to be decided  was  whether  the  appellant  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 297(i) (e) or (f) which provide :-

          i) is seeking leave to enter, to  accompany  or  join  a  parent,
             parents  or  other  relative   in   one   of   the   following
             circumstances: -

             ....


             (e) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had
             sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or


             (f) one parent or relative  is  present  and  settled  in  the
             United Kingdom or being admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
             settlement and there are  serious  and  compelling  family  or
             other  considerations  which  make  exclusion  of  the   child
             undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made  for  the
             child care;...


17. The remaining requirements of paragraph 297 have not been put in  issue
    and it appears to be conceded that they have been met. It is  only  the
    paragraphs identified which are in dispute.

18. The letter of refusal gives the  following  reasons  for  refusing  the
    application:-

         a) It was acknowledged that the appellant is the child  of  Natalie
            Foster.

         b) Ms Foster had entered the United Kingdom in 2002 but appears not
            to have gone back  to  Jamaica  until  2012.  There  was  little
            evidence of contact between the appellant and her mother in  the
            10 years intervening. Whilst it was  claimed  that  the  parties
            were communicating with each other, the only  evidence  produced
            was one birthday card with the application but it  is  uncertain
            whether this card was ever mailed  to  the  mother.  Photographs
            were enclosed but no timeframe was given for photographs.

         c) There was  no  evidence  to  demonstrate  that  the  mother  had
            provided financial or other support or had ever been involved in
            the key decisions regarding the upbringing of the  child.  There
            was  no  evidence  of  involvement  in  the  education,  health,
            religious or social development.

         d) While living in  Jamaica  the  appellant  was  living  with  her
            grandmother who appeared to be responsible for the appellant

         e) While some remittance slips had been submitted to indicate money
            had been sent there was no evidence that they were  sent  solely
            for the appellant.

         f) In the circumstances it was concluded  that  the  appellant  had
            failed to show that her mother had had sole  responsibility  for
            the appellant and therefore  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
            requirements paragraph 297(i)(e).

         g) As stated the appellant had lived with her grandmother since the
            mother's departure for the United Kingdom.  There  was  evidence
            that the grandmother had  suffered  a  stroke  in  2012.  It  is
            alleged that the grandmother requires a fulltime carer.  However
            arrangements had been made for the appellant to board at school,
            named as Hampton School. There was no evidence  that  she  could
            not continue  her  studies  at  Hampton  School.  There  was  no
            evidence to show that she was living in dangerous or  precarious
            situations or was in any need at all. Accordingly there were  no
            serious or compelling family or other considerations which would
            make exclusion undesirable.

         h) It was determined therefore that the appellant did not meet  the
            requirements paragraph 297 (i) (f).

19. With regard to the issue of sole responsibility I  have  been  provided
    with the case of TD (Paragraph 297 (i)e) : sole  responsibility)  Yemen
    [2006] UKAIT 00049. The headnote of which provides as follows:-

      Sole responsibility is a factual matter to be decided  upon  all  the
    evidence. Where one parent is not involved in  the  child's  upbringing
    because he (or she) had  abandoned  or  abdicated  responsibility,  the
    issue may arise between the remaining parent and others who have day-to-
    day care of the child abroad.  The  test  is  whether  the  parent  has
    continuing control and direction over the child's upbringing, including
    making all the important decisions in the child's life. However,  where
    both  parents  are  involved  in  a  child's  upbringing  it  will   be
    exceptional that one of them will have sole responsibility.


20. The case summarise a number of legal authorities. The  case  identifies
    that the core issue is to determine who makes the significant decisions
    about the child's upbringing and whose obligation it is to  make  those
    decisions. Whilst financial support  may  be  relevant,  of  itself  it
    cannot be conclusive. There is also reference  to  the  fact  that  the
    normal care that parents will have for a child,  whilst  relevant,  may
    not of itself show  that  the  parent  has  sole  responsibility.  Sole
    responsibility appears to import requirement that the individual  makes
    all the major decisions for the child. Parental responsibility  may  be
    shared between the parent abroad  and  the  carer  in  the  country  of
    residence of the child. Where the UK-based parent has allowed the carer
    abroad to make the important decisions in the child's  upbringing  then
    it can readily be said that responsibility for  the  child  has  become
    shared.

    Evidence


21. As stated the sponsor, Ms Natalie Foster, attended  and  gave  evidence
    before me.  I  have  the  appellant's  bundle  including  the  original
    application  and  documents  supporting  the  application   that   were
    submitted to the ECO. I also have a bundle of  documents  submitted  by
    the appellant.

22. The sponsor had originally entered the United Kingdom from Jamaica  and
    at the time did not require a visa. She had entered on  1  August  2002
    and was given entry valid until 31 December 2003.

23. The sponsor  had  over  the  years  visited  Jamaica  on  a  number  of
    occasions. The first time was on 15 July 2007 until 30 July  2007,  the
    second time 14 June 2008 till 16 June 2008, third time 25 December 2010
    to 16 January 2011, fourth time 28th of June 2012  until  11  September
    2012, fifth time 11 June 2014 to the 14 July 2014, six time 5 June 2015
    to 18 June 2015 and finally prior to these proceedings on 10 June  2016
    to 27 June 2016. By the time of the first  visit  the  appellant  would
    have been 10 years old.

24. When the sponsor came to the United Kingdom she left her child  in  the
    care of her 'mother', Mrs Veronica Foster. Whilst the sponsor used  the
    term mother for Mrs Veronica Foster,  it  appears  that  the  sponsor's
    biological  mother  is  one  Dorothy  Williams.  It  appears  that  the
    sponsor's father was married more  than  once  and  that  Mrs  Veronica
    Foster was his second wife. The sponsor's father's marriage certificate
    to Mrs Veronica Foster has been produced. It was the  sponsor's  father
    and Mrs Veronica Foster, who brought the sponsor up. Some time ago  Mrs
    Veronica Foster  and  the  sponsor's  father  separated.  Despite  that
    separation the sponsor has always viewed Mrs  Veronica  Foster  as  her
    mother. She admits that her father is still alive  and  appears  to  be
    living in Jamaica.

25. Prior to coming to the United Kingdom the sponsor claims that  she  was
    working in a Nursery. She had asked the principal  at  the  nursery  to
    allow her to take her daughter with her while she worked. So  from  the
    age of 2 � the appellant had been at  the  nursery  at  which  she  was
    working.

26. When the sponsor came to the United Kingdom in 2002 the appellant would
    have been five years old. The appellant was left in  the  care  of  Mrs
    Veronica Foster. When she commenced school she  was  originally  a  day
    student. When the sponsor was asked how  she  had  decided  upon  which
    school to send her daughter to, she stated that it was the local school
    in the area in which Mrs Veronica Foster lived and as  it  was  a  good
    school her daughter (the appellant) had attend there.

27. When asked about the father of the child, the sponsor stated  that  the
    father of the child had abandoned the appellant, when she was pregnant,
    and he had had no involvement in the upbringing of the child.

28. It was noted that the sponsor had  been  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom on 13 March 2010.

29. In her statement the sponsor has  set  out  that  Mrs  Veronica  Foster
    suffered a stroke in June 2011. Since that date it is alleged that  she
    has become immobile on her left side and is wheelchair bound.  At  that
    stage the sponsor indicates because there was no other person  to  care
    for her daughter she began to make plans to bring her daughter  to  the
    United Kingdom. Until that could be done she had to make  an  immediate
    decision to change her daughter from being a day  student  to  being  a
    student boarded at the school.

30. The sponsor gave evidence that the appellant  remained  at  the  school
    during the week and usually  at  weekends,  although  occasionally  she
    visited Mrs Veronica Foster and stayed with her. Similarly  during  the
    holiday times it was suggested that the appellant stayed at the  school
    most of the time.

31. The sponsor was asked in  cross-examination  why  she  had  delayed  in
    making the application to bring her daughter to the United Kingdom. She
    claimed that firstly she had to ensure that  she  herself  had  settled
    status/indefinite leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  that
    thereafter she was seeking to find suitable accommodation. She  claimed
    that initially she was living in  studio  flat.  She  had  taken  legal
    advice from a solicitor, who had indicated that  she  was  not  earning
    sufficient. The sponsor at that stage was only working  some  20  hours
    per week.

32. The sponsor was asked what involvement she had and what  role  did  she
    play with her daughter she indicated that she would save up  her  money
    and would send it to her mother, Mrs Veronica Foster. The  sponsor  did
    not refer to making any decisions about the  child,  her  education  or
    what the child was doing at that stage. She did however claim that  Mrs
    Veronica  Foster  was  just  a  caregiver  playing  the  role  of   the
    grandmother. Mrs Foster did provide a roof and kept the child clean and
    looked after the child but she the sponsor would send money and provide
    whatever the child needed.

33. In her statement however she had stated that she was the one  that  was
    making all the decisions for the child she was the one responsible  for
    the school fees. She had kept in touch with her daughter  by  means  of
    phone-cards and other  means.  When  asked  about  school  reports  and
    contact with the school, the sponsor stated she had submitted  such  to
    the ECO but had not  brought  any  correspondence  or  other  documents
    showing that she had been in touch with the school, save for  a  letter
    that she had requested from the school.

34. There are documents submitted with the ECO bundle, including  a  letter
    from the school and a letter from a local JP written at the request  of
    the sponsor. There is in that bundle no school  reports.  The  list  of
    documents does not contain any reference to  any  such  school  reports
    being submitted with the application.

35. That having  been  said  there  is  the  sixth  form  application  form
    submitted by the appellant to the Hampton School. It  is  to  be  noted
    that the parent or guardian identified therein is Mrs Veronica  Foster.
    That application form is dated 2014. There  was  no  reference  to  the
    appellant referring to the sponsor asking what subjects she should take
    in the sixth form. There is no indication that the sponsor  was  to  be
    contacted should any issue arise.

36. Further to that, a letter in support written by the school headmistress
    refers to the fact that the appellant is merely coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom for the purposes of a visit during the holidays. That letter is
    dated 23 June 2014.

37. As stated there is a letter from the JP dated 18 June 2014. The  letter
    also refers to the fact that Mrs Veronica Foster the grandmother of the
    appellant is her sole guardian. It does however confirm  to  an  extent
    that the grandmother has suffered a stroke and is  partially  disabled.
    It also acknowledges that the mother in the United Kingdom  would  like
    to take back the guardianship of her daughter.

38. There is a brief medical report in  respect  of  Mrs  Veronica  Foster,
    which indicates that she has a dense left hemiparesis  after  a  severe
    cerebrovascular accident (stroke). It suggests that as a result she  is
    unable to  effectively  careful  for  her  teenage  granddaughter,  the
    appellant. It does not indicate in what way the needs of the  appellant
    were not being met, given that she was 17 � at the time of the report.

39. In her statement the sponsor indicates that there is no other person in
    Jamaica that can care for her daughter. It does appear  that  certainly
    her grandfather is there. It is to be noted that a number of  telephone
    cards were submitted. I also note that the monies were sent  ostensibly
    to Mrs Veronica Foster because the appellant herself  would  have  been
    unable to pick up the money.

40. It is submitted by the respondent that only one birthday card had  been
    submitted as that was a card that showed the relationship with  between
    the appellant and her mother.

41. Whilst the sponsor has stated she submitted  school  reports  with  her
    application none of them appear in the ECA  bundle  and  non-have  been
    produced before  me.  The  list  of  documents  does  not  contain  any
    reference to such, despite a bundle being submitted to the Tribunal.

42. I note the statement from the appellant. She deals with the  fact  that
    she has been separated from the mother  for  a  significant  period  of
    time. She does refer to the fact that her  grandmother  has  played  an
    important role in her life and refers to the fact  that  her  life  has
    begun to crumble since her grandmother became ill. She accepts that her
    mother had to work in the United Kingdom.

43. At the sponsor in giving evidence referred to the fact that at the time
    Mrs Veronica Foster went ill she had gone to Jamaica and  stayed  there
    for 2 � months. She had only returned to the United Kingdom because  of
    financial issues. It has to be  accepted  that  during  that  time  the
    arrangements for putting the appellant into boarding  at  school  could
    have been made.

44.  It is on the basis indicated that the appellant claims to be  entitled
    to entry clearance to the United Kingdom  as  the  child  of  a  person
    present and settled here  in  accordance  with  paragraph  297  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

    Consideration


45. The only issue raised under the rules is whether or not the sponsor  in
    the United Kingdom  has  had  sole  responsibility  for  the  child  in
    Jamaica.

46. Mrs Veronica Foster suffered her stroke in 2011. It is  suggested  that
    she was unable to provide any care for the appellant after  that  date.
    It has to be accepted that it would be possible given the fact that the
    sponsor was in Jamaica for some 2 � months  for  various  decisions  to
    have been made at that time. However if that had been  the  case  there
    appears to be no reason why the sponsor who otherwise can  contact  the
    school should not be named as the Guardian on the school  documentation
    in 2014.

47. The six form application form clearly identifies the  Guardian  as  Mrs
    Veronica Foster. Similarly the email contact and telephone  numbers  do
    not relate in any way to the sponsor. If the sponsor was so  materially
    involved in the decision-making on behalf of the appellant and  if  Mrs
    Veronica Foster was  no  longer  able  to  make  those  decisions  some
    explanation was necessary as to why the six form application form makes
    no reference at all to the  sponsor.  The  email  address  for  contact
    appears to be the appellant herself.

48. Similarly the letter from  the  school  dated  23  June  2014  for  the
    purposes of the  application  clearly  give  the  impression  that  the
    appellant was only coming to the United Kingdom during the holidays and
    not on a permanent basis. Whilst the sponsor  sought  to  suggest  that
    that was just the way that the school had framed  the  letter,  it  was
    material that  the  school  were  not  aware  that  the  appellant  was
    purportedly coming to the United Kingdom to settle and did not indicate
    that they had concerns as to the welfare of the appellant.

49. The letter from the JP specifically refers to Mrs  Veronica  Foster  as
    the sole guardian. That letter also indicates that  she  has  graduated
    from school and is due to go on to further education. That letter  does
    acknowledge at least that the mother is seeking to re-establish herself
    as the Guardian but it makes no reference to  decisions  taken  by  the
    sponsor.

50. Within the documentation produced there is no reference to  any  school
    reports. Much though the sponsor claim to have submitted them with  the
    application, the only documents received from the school related to the
    sixth form application and the letter that the  sponsor  had  requested
    from the school. If  the  sponsor  were  that  materially  involved  in
    monitoring the child's education I find  that  she  would  be  able  to
    produce and would have produced to the ECO the school reports  for  the
    appellant.  I  also  find  that  she  would  have  been  named  on  the
    application in 2014 as the individual to be contacted or  at  the  very
    least as one of the two individuals to be contacted. There was  nothing
    to prevent the sponsor having an email account or contact  address  for
    the school.

51. I take account of the fact that the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  have
    sought to indicate that they miss each other and that it  is  difficult
    being separated. It has to be noted that the appellant has lived  since
    2002 without her mother. I also take  account  of  the  fact  that  the
    mother has visited regularly.

52. However it is clear from the documents produced both  from  the  school
    and from the JP that the  person  materially  involved  in  making  the
    decisions in respect of the appellant  has  always  been  Mrs  Veronica
    Foster. She has been recognised as the Guardian of the  child  in  fact
    and the person to contact both by the school and the authorities. There
    is no suggestion that anyone was seeking to contact  the  sponsor  felt
    that there was any need to do so. There  was  no  suggestion  that  the
    school required the address of the sponsor in  case  any  issues  arose
    with regard to the appellant.  I  find  that  the  major  decisions  in
    respect of the child's life have been taken by Mrs Veronica  Foster.  I
    am satisfied that the authorities including the school  authorities  in
    Jamaica see Mrs Veronica Foster as the Guardian of the appellant and as
    the person to whom they should turn if any issue arises with the child.



53. Whilst it is suggested that the child required  some  support  from  an
    adult, there was no evidence that the child's needs were not being  met
    in the circumstances.

54. I would note further that despite the fact  that  Mrs  Veronica  Foster
    suffered her stroke in 2011,  the  appellant  continued  to  reside  in
    Jamaica. Whilst the sponsor has suggested that she was seeking to  make
    an application to bring the appellant to the United Kingdom it is to be
    noted that she was only working part-time. She has suggested  that  she
    contacted solicitors,  who  indicated  that  she  could  not  meet  the
    financial requirements. Any solicitor examining the  rules  would  note
    that if the sponsor worked full-time she may have had sufficient  funds
    to support an application by the appellant. However it  took  over  two
    years for that application to be made.

55. Taking all the evidence into account  I  find  that  responsibility  in
    respect of this child has been shared  over  the  years  and  that  the
    primary responsibility was with Veronica Foster.  Even  after  Veronica
    Foster's stroke I find that the authorities continue to consider her as
    the Guardian and the person to refer to if any material decisions  need
    to be taken in respect of the child. I find in the  circumstances  that
    sole responsibility for the child has not resided with the mother,  the
    sponsor but has been shared between the sponsor and Mrs Veronica Foster
    and that that continued whilst the appellant was in education.

56.  I  have  to  consider  whether  or  not  there  are   any   compelling
    compassionate circumstances. This appears to be a child that has  lived
    all her life in Jamaica and appears to be well  settled  there,  whilst
    she would wish to have a closer relationship with her mother  there  is
    nothing of a compelling or compassionate nature which would  result  in
    her meeting the requirements of the rules. Nothing has been  identified
    in any of the letters submitted in support  which  indicates  that  the
    appellant's needs are not being adequately met all that  the  appellant
    in somewhere other is suffering in the circumstances in which she finds
    herself.

57. Accordingly I do not find that the sponsor has had sole  responsibility
    for the child. Further I do not find that there are  any  compassionate
    or compelling circumstances, which mean that decision not to grant  the
    appellant entry clearance is undesirable. For the  reasons  set  out  I
    find the appellant does not meet the requirements of the rules.

58. I have considered in the circumstances whether or not article 8 outside
    the rules is engaged on the facts.

59. The sponsor has over years allowed a situation in which the family life
    between the appellant and the sponsor required the appellant to live in
    Jamaica, whilst the sponsor lived and worked  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Whilst it may be that the sponsor  saw  that  was  a  better  means  of
    earning the living to support her daughter, it is to be noted that  she
    was willing to work part time rather than full-time and that was one of
    the reason she was unable to make an application earlier. If there were
    such a pressing need to bring the child to the United Kingdom then  the
    sponsor could have worked full-time and sought  to  have  improved  her
    circumstances meet the financial requirements and the  requirements  in
    respect of adequate accommodation. The sponsor has specifically  raised
    that is an issue during the course  of  giving  evidence  but  gave  no
    reason why she could not work full-time and thereby acquired the  means
    to obtain adequate accommodation. If there had  been  such  a  pressing
    need for the appellant to come to the United Kingdom an application for
    entry for her daughter at an earlier time.

60. In the circumstances the decision by the respondent  does  not  I  find
    interfere with the form  of  family  life  that  the  sponsor  and  the
    appellant have enjoyed over the years. The parties can continue to  see
    each other when the mother visits Jamaica.

61. In the circumstances I am not satisfied that it is  the  decision  that
    interferes with family life. If I am wrong in that regard then  clearly
    the decision I find is in accordance with the law and for the  purposes
    of maintaining immigration control.

62. As a final matter I would have to consider whether or not the  decision
    is proportionately justified. Taking account of all the circumstances I
    am  satisfied  that  the   decision   is   proportionately   justified.
    Accordingly I do not find that anyone's  rights  under  Article  8  are
    breached on the facts as presented
