Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss H Masih (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Obhi, promulgated on 30th September 2014, following a  hearing
    at  Birmingham,  Sheldon  Court  on  12th  September  2014.    In   the
    determination, the judge dismissed the appeal of Mr Mehran Azimi.   The
    Appellant subsequently applied for,  and  was  granted,  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a  citizen  of  Iran,  who  was  born  on  3rd
    September 1985.  He applied for asylum, having arrived  in  the  UK  on
    17th April 2014, after he was informed  of  his  entry  as  an  illegal
    entrant and of is liability to removal.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim  is  that  he  fears  persecution  by  the  state
    authorities in Iran because of his connections with  bloggers,  because
    web bloggers use facilities in his shop, and because he  assisted  them
    in providing them with printed literature and DCSs, and this eventually
    came to the attention of the authorities, who assumed that he was  also
    a blogger and also assumed that he was being anti-Islamic.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge  made  positive  findings  in  favour  of  the  Appellant  at
    paragraph 30 of the determination observing that,
         "The core of his account has remained consistent.  The fact that he
         ran an internet caf� and that he  was  a  Masters  student  is  not
         disputed.  His claim that he did not oversee  the  content  of  his
         customers' use of the caf�, is considered not to be credible.   The
         Appellant   states   that   he   allowed   his   clients   complete
         confidentiality.  The Secretary of State considers it unlikely that
         he would not have oversee what the users  were  doing,  as  he  was
         placed in a university setting and it was likely that there may  be
         political opinion expressed.   I  am  not  sure  that  this  is  an
         automatic assumption by someone who may not have  been  exposed  to
         political opinion; not all students are, particularly in  a  regime
         like Iran.  I therefore accept that the Appellant's claim  that  he
         allowed the users of the caf� to have complete confidentiality  ...
         the Appellant  is  an  educated  person,  he  has  maintained  this
         throughout.  I agree with Miss Masih that there does not appear  to
         be any evidence to suggest that the Appellant has  embellished  his
         account" (paragraph 30).

 5. However, the judge also went  on  to  make  additional  findings  which
    undermine the Appellant's credibility observing that,
         "There are, however, aspects of the  Appellant's  claim  which  are
         less credible".  These related to, "the fact that he  was  released
         at all if he was considered to be a political threat and  the  lack
         of real investigation by the authorities as to where he has gone or
         any repercussions for the family who have openly allowed him to go.
          There are regular telephone calls by  him  to  his  parents.   One
         would assume that the authorities would  be  able  to  check  these
         things and would know what was going on ..." (paragraph 32).

 6. The judge also observed that,
         "I note further from the COIR Report that court summons  would  not
         be served by post, and having initially said that this summons  was
         the Appellant corrects this in his later evidence and says that  he
         said it had been  posted  because  that  is  what  his  wife  said.
         However, considering that the Appellant is an intelligent  man  who
         lived in Iran, who had been through the  court  process,  he  would
         know that summons are not sent by post, and would have queried  the
         claim" (paragraph 34).

 7. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application suggest that the judge made conflicting  and
    inconsistent findings of credibility which amounted  to  an  irrational
    determination.

 9. On 20th October 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

10. On 14th November 2014, a Rule 24 response was  entered  to  the  effect
    that detailed analysis had been carried out by the judge at  paragraphs
    29 to 34, which did warrant the findings made by the judge, such as  to
    avoid their becoming irrational.

11. At the hearing before me,  Miss  Masih,  relied  upon  her  grounds  of
    application.  She pointed out that the judge at paragraphs 30 and 31 of
    the  determination  had  accepted  that  the  Appellant's  account  had
    remained consistent.  Any errors that  there  may  have  been  in  this
    account were simply errors.  Indeed the judge went on to say  that  the
    core aspects of the claim were plausible.

12. However,  subsequently,  when  the  judge  considered  the  documentary
    evidence, particularly in relation  to  the  summons  letter,  and  two
    letters from the Appellant's father, and a letter from the  Appellant's
    wife, she failed to state what weight would be  attached,  if  any,  to
    each piece of evidence, as she did not apply the case of Tanveer  Ahmed
    to the assessment of this documentary evidence.

13. Furthermore, the judge made additional findings of fact  at  paragraphs
    32 to 34, such as drawing an adverse inference from the fact  that  the
    Appellant did not know about the raid on his father's house  (paragraph
    32)  and  his  initial  evidence  concerning  receipt  of  the  summons
    (paragraph 34), but failed to take into account  the  contents  of  the
    letters provided by the Appellant's family members, which went directly
    to this issue.

14. Additionally, the judge looked at the document referred to as  a  court
    summons (at paragraphs 33 to 34) which was titled  "Summons  letter  to
    the accused" and finds that the documents were "curious"  because  "the
    presentation  of  a  summons  to  his   wife   seems   odd   in   these
    circumstances".

15. However, these findings are made in the absence of a  consideration  of
    the property deed and bail document, which the judge  did  find  to  be
    plausible, without giving adequate reasons.

The Hearing

16. At the hearing before me on 7th October 2015, Mr David Mills, appearing
    as Senior Home Office Presenting Officer, submitted at  the  outset  of
    the hearing that he would have to concede that the judge's findings did
    amount  to  a  determination  which  was  inconsistent  and   therefore
    unsustainable.

17. He particularly drew attention to the way in which the summons had been
    sent by  post,  according  to  the  Appellant's  wife,  notwithstanding
    additional evidence that did go directly to this issue, which  was  not
    considered by the judge.

18. Secondly, Mr Mills submitted that there  was  now  also  an  additional
    issue in terms of the Appellant's  conversion  from  the  Shia  Islamic
    faith to the Christian faith,  which  would  have  necessitated  a  new
    application being made by the Appellant,  so  that  it  was  altogether
    better that all these issues were considered together, after a remittal
    had been made to another Tribunal below.

19. Miss Masih, replied to say that if the error of law was  conceded,  and
    there was to be a remittal, then the full bundle of documents should be
    returned to the Appellant, because there had been  a  change  of  legal
    representation, involving both a change of solicitors and  of  Counsel,
    such that the Appellant's side did not now have all the documents  that
    they had previously relied upon.

Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error of law for the reasons that have been given  and
    stated in Miss Masih's clear and succinct grounds of application.

21. I do not accept that the fact that there is now an additional dimension
    to this case, namely, the conversion of the Appellant to the  Christian
    faith, can be used in any way to impugn the determination of the  judge
    before whom these facts were not  known,  but  I  accept  that  to  all
    practical intents and purposes, once the matter  returns  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal, to be heard by a judge other than Judge Obhi, that
    evidence on these matters will require to be heard.

22. For all these reasons, this appeal is allowed to the extent that it  is
    remitted back to a judge at Sheldon Court, Birmingham to be heard by  a
    Tribunal other than that of Judge Obhi at  the  first  available  date.
    The matter is to be set down for  a  three  hour  hearing,  with  three
    witnesses to be called, and a Farsi interpreter, and all the  available
    documents that are in the Tribunal file are, upon  application  by  the
    Appellant's   solicitors,   to   be   returned   to   the   Appellant's
    representatives.

Notice of Decision

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  The  determination  is  set
    aside.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal is remitted back
    to the First-tier Tribunal in Birmingham, Sheldon Court, to be heard by
    a judge other than Judge Obhi on  a  de  novo  basis  with  all  issues
    remaining outstanding.

24. No anonymity order is made.
