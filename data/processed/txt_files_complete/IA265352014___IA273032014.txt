Representation:
For the appellants:    Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, George Aboagye, date of birth  11.6.77,  and  his  wife,
    Angal Faith Aboagye, date of birth 3.4.82, are citizens of Ghana.

 2. These are their  linked  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Ransley promulgated 13.10.14, dismissing  their  appeals
    against the decisions of the respondent to  refuse  their  applications
    made on 27.5.14 for leave to remain in the UK as  a  Tier  2  (General)
    Migrant and dependent family  member,  pursuant  to  the  Points  Based
    System (PBS) of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the  appeal  on
    6.10.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Shimmin  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.11.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 30.7.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below, I find that there was no error of law in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  the
    determination of Judge Ransley to be set aside.

 6. The application was refused because on his Certificate  of  Sponsorship
    (COS) the first appellant failed to meet the requirements of Code  2112
    of the Code of Practice specified under  Appendix  J  for  the  minimum
    acceptable rate of pay for a 39 hour working week,  which  is  �27,000.
    The COS stated the salary was �25,000  for  a  37.5  hour  week,  which
    equates to �25,998 for a 39 hour week. In the circumstances, the  first
    appellant was awarded  no  points  under  Appendix  A  for  Appropriate
    Salary.

 7. Judge Ransley, dealing with the appeal on the  papers  found  that  the
    appellants did not meet the requirements of the Rules, and noting  that
    article 8 was not relied on, dismissed the appeals.

 8. The grounds of appeal  complain  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    ignored the letter at A39 of  the  appellant's  bundle,  dated  1.5.14,
    stating that the salary had  increased  to  �27,000  with  effect  from
    1.5.14. However, the appellants  accepted  that  this  letter  was  not
    submitted with the application. By section 85A(4) of the 2002  Act  the
    Tribunal can only consider evidence in a PBS case  which  is  submitted
    with and at the time of the application. Neither I, nor Judge  Ransley,
    could take the letter into account. Even if the letter itself  were  to
    be admitted, the fact remains that the COS  did  not  reflect  the  new
    salary level and thus the appeal would still be dismissed.

 9. It is unfortunate that in granting permission to appeal  Judge  Shimmin
    neglected to consider this  very  basic  evidential  provision  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

10. In the circumstances, it was inevitable that the application would have
    been dismissed  and  inevitable  that  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was doomed from its inception.

11. The only remedy for the appellants is to make a new application with  a
    COS which meets the requirements of Appendices A and J.

Conclusions:

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each appellant remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005.  Given  the  circumstances,  I
make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals to the Upper Tribunal have been dismissed.
