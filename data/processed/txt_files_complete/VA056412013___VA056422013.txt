Representation

For the Appellants:    Mr D Coleman, counsel (instructed by Charles
Simmonds      Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants are nationals of India, and are husband and wife. Their
      appeals against the decision of the respondent  dated  11th  September
      2013 refusing their applications for an entry clearance as visitors to
      the UK were dismissed by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Napthine  in  a
      determination promulgated on 30th April 2014.


   2. Following the submission of  lengthy  grounds  of  appeal,  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Osborne granted them permission to appeal to the  Upper
      Tribunal. It had been contended that the  Judge  had  not  had  proper
      regard to the documentation before him.  He noted that the  First-tier
      Judge referred indirectly to the fact that  the  sponsor  attended  to
      give oral evidence at the hearing before him but  failed  to  set  out
      either in summary or  in  any  detailed  form  the  substance  of  her
      evidence.


   3. In granting permission, Judge Osborne stated  that  the  Judge  should
      accurately record details of the hearing including the evidence of all
      witnesses including the sponsor. Whilst their sponsor may not be  able
      to  give  detailed  financial  information   about   the   appellants'
      circumstances, the Judge was nevertheless under  a  duty  to  indicate
      which evidence he accepted and which he rejected.


   4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge had  stated  [20]  that  without  proper
      accounts how could any profit from the land and  the  hire  out  of  a
      lorry be assessed. A number of  people  are  dependent  on  the  first
      appellant's agriculture for the income generated. He accordingly found
      that the appellants had not proved that  their  financial  and  social
      circumstances in India were such that they are likely to return at the
      end of the trip.


   5. In the Rule 24 response, the respondent opposed the  appeal  initially
      as  without  the  extensive  documentary  evidence   not   immediately
      available it could not be accepted that the determination is flawed.


   6. At the hearing on  5th  August  2014,  Mr  Deller  on  behalf  of  the
      respondent indicated that he had now had the opportunity  to  consider
      the documentary evidence, including the statements.


   7. Mr Coleman relied on the grounds of appeal, which he did not draft. He
      submitted that this is a "straightforward visit case."


   8. It had been accepted that the sponsors were to bear the costs  of  the
      visit. The Judge in the short determination failed to engage with  the
      evidence, including the appellants' circumstances. Nor did he  "engage
      with the sponsor's evidence." Although noting that he had  taken  into
      account  the  documentation  including  the  appellants'  bundle   and
      although finding from the sponsor's evidence, that her parents did not
      overstay their visa period, indicating that the sponsor was a credible
      witness, he ought to have had regard to the sponsor's further evidence
      regarding the appellants' circumstances in India.


   9. Further,  the  Judge's  statement  at  paragraph  18  that  the  first
      appellant's income  is  not  demonstrated  from  the  bank  statements
      submitted, failed to have regard  to  the  various  land  deeds,  crop
      receipts produced as well as bank statements  for  any  cash  that  is
      deposited. This is a cash based economy  and  farming  income  is  not
      taxable. There was also an  accountant's  report  that  had  not  been
      considered.


  10. He submitted that it was irrelevant "how rich or poor they are".  That
      is because it was accepted that the sponsor would be bearing the costs
      of the trip. The income from agriculture  is  pooled  and  the  family
      lives on the shared amounts.


  11. Further, the findings at paragraphs 22, 23 and 24 do not  have  regard
      to the evidence and in particular the sponsor's evidence.  Mr  Coleman
      referred to  paragraphs  11,  13  and  14  of  the  sponsor's  witness
      statement. In it, she  states  that  her  brother  provided  what  was
      available for him and his share of the income. This consisted of  land
      deeds, translations, crop receipts, a  chartered  accountant's  report
      and bank statements.


  12. At paragraph 13 of her statement, she stated that the land is owned by
      them and is 13.5 acres and that the income  earned  was  "between  the
      four of them at the time."


  13.  He  submitted  that  the  evidence  thus  showed  that  there  was  a
      smallholding for the family to live on. The Judge did not engage  with
      the appellants' circumstances in India. There were no proper  findings
      relating to the sponsor's evidence regarding those circumstances.


  14. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Deller stated that what concerned  him
      was that the sponsor's evidence referred to  and  dealt  with  matters
      relevant to the appellants' intention to leave the UK. There had  been
      no suggestion that the funding would not be available.


  15. He submitted that it may be that the Judge 'did search too  hard'  for
      the financial circumstances of the appellants.  However,  he  accepted
      that the sponsor's evidence went to address the respondent's  reasons,
      and in particular the apparent lengthy visit by her parents. That  was
      a matter which was resolved in their favour by the Judge.


  16. He submitted that although a specific finding  of  credibility  cannot
      "be extrapolated into a general finding regarding her credibility" the
      Judge did not deal with the balance of her evidence.


  17. Moreover, Mr Deller very properly pointed out  that  the  sponsor  had
      sponsored her husband's parents and his young nephew. They all visited
      and returned home having fulfilled the conditions of their visas.


  18. He submitted that if the sponsor "has form" in relation to overstaying
      visitors, then that can have a  significant  impact  relating  to  the
      intentions of the appellants. However, having regard to her good track
      record, how would  this  have  been  different  in  respect  of  these
      appellants' cases?


  19. Mr Deller therefore accepted that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  not
      given proper consideration and weight to the evidence of the  sponsor.
      He should have considered the implications of the  rest  of  what  the
      sponsor said.  The  Judge  however  looked  'too  searchingly  to  the
      appellants' resources'.


  20. Having considered the submissions of the  parties,  I  find  that  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  properly  deal  with  the
      evidence of the sponsor.  Nor  was  her  track  record  of  successful
      sponsoring of family members taken into  account.   I  set  aside  the
      decision and remake it.


  21. Mr Coleman called Mrs Rupinder Kaur to give evidence. She adopted  her
      witness statement dated 24th  March  2014.  The  only  change  to  the
      statement is that she has since given birth to her child.


  22. Mrs Kaur is a Portuguese national, as is her husband.  They  are  both
      employed and their "cumulative income" exceeds �40,000 per annum. They
      also have savings of over �7,000 in a joint account.


  23. The appellants are her brother and sister in law.  She  confirmed  her
      sponsorship declaration dated 10th January 2013. Their children do not
      have appeal rights. The appeals are only being brought  on  behalf  of
      the appellants. Even if the appeal were to succeed, the children would
      not seek to accompany the appellants to the UK.


  24. Her brother and sister in law live in a joint family in India, in  the
      paternal family home. They are  self  employed  and  have  comfortable
      lives. They have shared family living costs, no rent, no mortgage  and
      only small bills. Their children are both at school and doing well.


  25. The land owned by the appellants comprises about 13.5  acres  and  the
      income is about Rs 850,000 between the four of them.


  26. The land  deeds  produced  indicate  that  her  brothers,  father  and
      grandfather own the land. Her brother explained what  income  is  made
      per acre and how the income is roughly split. There is no tax  payable
      on the income. That is why there are no tax documents.


  27. She confirmed that her brother does the work he stated and  earns  the
      income claimed. That income has since "gone up".


  28. He also has funds in his Punjab National Bank Account which he holds.


  29. She "completely disagrees" with the assertion of the  respondent  that
      the appellants would not return to India after their visit. They  have
      every reason to return because of their own circumstances and  because
      of hers as their sponsor.


  30. She has sponsored other relatives who have always  complied  with  the
      terms of their visas. She would not  allow  anyone  to  jeopardise  or
      affect her position or her record.


  31. Nor is it true that her parents visited the UK for nine  months  on  a
      six month visa: -that has been accepted and is no longer a contention.




  32. Mr Coleman asked her whether they would go back. She  said  that  they
      have family there. She will not keep  them  here.  Nobody  has  stayed
      before. Their children would  be  left  behind.  Were  the  appeal  to
      succeed they would not bring the children over.


  33. Mr Deller did not ask any questions. He was content for  the  contents
      of the witness statement to stand.


  34. In submissions, Mr Deller accepted that the parents had not overstayed
      in  their  visit.  The  question  is  whether  on   the   balance   of
      probabilities, the appellants have discharged the  burden  of  showing
      the genuineness of the visits and  their  intentions  to  return.  The
      evidence should be looked at in the round.


  35. On behalf of the appellants, it was submitted that the sponsor  should
      be found to be credible. This is  a  straightforward  visa  case.  The
      children are being left behind.  There  are  "big  familial  roots  to
      return to." There is income generated from the land which  has  to  be
      worked. Regard also should be had to the previous track record of  the
      sponsor.


     Findings and determination


  36. I found the evidence of the sponsor to be credible. There has been  no
      challenge to any of her assertions.


  37. I accordingly accept that the appellants live in  a  joint  family  in
      India in the family home. They are  self  employed  and  share  family
      living costs. Their children are at school. In any  event  they  would
      not be accompanying their parents to the UK.


  38. I  have  also  had  regard  to  the  sponsor's  record  of  sponsoring
      relatives. There has never been any overstaying.


  39. In these circumstances I have no reason to suppose that the intentions
      of the appellants are anything other than that which they have  given.
      It is difficult in these circumstances to imagine any ulterior  motive
      in wanting to visit the UK. It is perfectly natural  that  they  would
      wish to visit family members here. I am also satisfied that they  have
      strong social as well as financial roots in India.


  40. Having regard to the evidence as a whole, I find that the decision  of
      the respondent was not in accordance with the law and the  immigration
      rules.


     Decision


     Having set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  I  re-make
the decision  allowing the appellants' appeals.
