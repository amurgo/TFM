Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Heller, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotos, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 3rd November 1981.   The
    Appellant was granted entry clearance as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    valid from 12th January 2011 to 30th April 2012.  The Appellant entered
    the UK on 12th February 2011.  His leave was subsequently extended as a
    Tier 4 Student on two occasions valid until 30th September 2014.

 2. On 30th September 2014 the Appellant applied for leave to remain in the
    United Kingdom on the basis of  his  family  and  private  life.   That
    application was refused by Notice of  Refusal  from  the  Secretary  of
    State dated 10th February 2015.

 3. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Bart-Stewart sitting at Taylor House on 3rd August  2016.
    In a decision  and  reasons  promulgated  on  1st  September  2016  the
    Appellant's appeal  was  dismissed  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    pursuant to Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.

 4. Grounds of Appeal were lodged to the  Upper  Tribunal.   Those  grounds
    cited two reasons:-

      1) that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  misinterpreted  Section
         117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002;  and
         her decision was not in accordance with the law; and

      2) that the Immigration Judge's conclusions that the  Appellant  could
         maintain  contact  with  his  biological  son  from  Pakistan   was
         unreasonable, unrealistic and disproportionate.

 5. On  19th  December  2016  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Shimmin  granted
    permission to appeal considering that it was arguable  that  the  judge
    had erred in the interpretation of Section  117B(6)  in  the  light  of
    modern case law in respect of one or both of the children  involved  in
    this appeal.

 6. I am advised by Mr Kotos that there was a Rule 24  response  served  in
    this matter.  I do not have a copy on file.  Both  he  and  Ms  Heller
    advise me that it adds little to the appeal.  It is on the basis of the
    above facts that the appeal comes before me to determine whether or not
    there is a material error of law in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge.  The Appellant appears by  his  instructed  Counsel  Ms
    Heller.  The Secretary of State appears by her Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer Mr Kotos.

Case Law

 7. The authority specifically referred to herein and  upon  which  I  have
    given due consideration is Treebhawon and Others (NIAA 2002 Part  5A -
    compelling circumstances test) [2017] UKUT  13  (IAC).   That  case  is
    authority for the following propositions

      i) Where the case for a foreign national who is not an  offender  does
         not satisfy the requirements of  Article  8,  ECHR  regime  of  the
         Immigration Rules, the test to be applied  is  that  of  compelling
         circumstances.

     ii) The parliamentary intention underlying part 5A of NIAA 2002  is  to
         give proper effect to Article 8.  Thus a private life developed  or
         established during periods  of  unlawful  or  precarious  residence
         might conceivably qualify to be accorded more  than  little  weight
         and Section 117B(4)  and  (5)  are  to  be  construed  and  applied
         accordingly.

    iii) Mere hardship, mere difficulty, mere  hurdles,  mere  upheaval  and
         mere inconvenience, even where multiplied, are unlikely to  satisfy
         the test of "very significant hurdles" in paragraph 276ADE  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

Submissions/Discussions

 8. Ms Heller relies on her skeleton argument and Grounds of  Appeal.   She
    takes me to Section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002 which states

    (6)  In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a qualifying child, and

         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
             United Kingdom.

    She submits that the judge appears to have found that  cohabitation  is
    necessary for a  parental  relationship  and  has  noted  that  contact
    between the father and son is limited.  She submits that such  findings
    are unsustainable, pointing out that the Appellant has contact with his
    son three hours a day.  The contact therefore is not  limited  and  she
    subsists that he  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship.   She
    submits that the findings and conclusions of  the  judge  were  totally
    unsustainable.

 9. Thereafter she turns to whether it would be reasonable for the child to
    accompany the parent (in this case the Appellant) if he is returned  to
    Pakistan.   She  points  out  that  that  is  not  remotely  practical,
    reminding me the Appellant and the child's  mother  are  separated  and
    that the child who is now aged 1ï¿½ lives  with  his  mother  and  it  is
    inconceivable that the mother would allow the child to go.   She  seeks
    to rely on the findings  on  Treebhawon  and  Others  [2017]  and  Kaur
    (children's best interests - public interest) [2017] UKUT 14 (IAC).

10. Ms Heller relies on the guidance given in  paragraph  117B(6)  and  the
    conditions (set out above) described by  parliament.   She  points  out
    that the statute proclaims unequivocally that  where  these  conditions
    are satisfied the public interest does not require the removal  of  the
    parent from the United Kingdom and that there is no ambiguity.

11. She points out that the child's mother has indefinite leave  to  remain
    and that contact is by written agreement, rather than by  court  order.
    Apparently the Appellant and his son's mother have been  separated  for
    nearly a year.  There is also a stepdaughter aged 6 and the Appellant's
    contention is that he has a parental relationship with the  child.   Ms
    Heller reminds me that he collects and picks her  up  from  school  and
    that her mother refers to the Appellant having a relationship with her.
     Apparently the Appellant takes her to school and sees her everyday and
    during the contact period.  She accepts that any arguments based  on  a
    relationship between the Appellant's stepdaughter and himself is weaker
    than that with his natural child, but  believes  that  it  is  still  a
    consideration.  She asks me to find that there are material  errors  of
    law in the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  to  set  the
    decision aside and to remit the matter to the First-tier  Tribunal  for
    rehearing.

12. Mr Kotos accepts that the judge has erred in law  in  her  approach  to
    Section 117(6)(b) but submits that this is not material.  So far as the
    stepchild is concerned he submits that the Appellant's relationship has
    been  adequately  addressed  at  paragraph  19  of  the  decision.   He
    acknowledges that based on the Appellant's  evidence  that  whilst  the
    marital relationship has broken down his son's mother still  wants  the
    Appellant to have a relationship with his son.

13. He points out that it has never been suggested that the Appellant meets
    the Immigration Rules and therefore it is necessary to show  compelling
    circumstances and he asks me to read carefully paragraphs 19 to  21  of
    the  judge's  decision.   He  submits  that  none  of  this  represents
    compelling circumstances.  He  submits  that  the  questions  posed  at
    paragraph 14 of Treebhawon  is  addressed  by  the  judge  albeit  that
    Treebhawon  postdates  the  judge's  decision.   He  submits  that  the
    analysis is predicated on an expectation that the child would  have  to
    leave but submits in this case there is no expectation that that  would
    actually happen and therefore the judge has  not  materially  erred  in
    law.

The Law

14.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

15. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

16. Despite the submissions made by Mr Kotos and his  acceptance  that  the
    judge has erred in law under Section 117(6)(b) I find that the error in
    law is material.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge found at  paragraph  19
    that whilst the Appellant met the requirements of  Section  117B(6)  of
    the 2002 Act the appeal was going to be dismissed because it "is lawful
    and fulfils the legitimate aim of immigration control."  It is accepted
    that that is an error in that it does not meet the wording  of  Section
    117(6)(b).   Where  an  Appellant  has   a   genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship with a British child and it is not  reasonable  to  expect
    the child to leave the UK and the public interest does not require  the
    Appellant's removal.  There is consequently therefore a material  error
    of law.

17. In addition Section 117(6)(b)(6) does not require the Appellant to live
    with his son, it requires him to have a genuine and subsisting parental
    relationship with a child.  My understanding is that he may well do  so
    and the First-tier Tribunal Judge has raised no concerns as to  whether
    his father/son relationship is anything but genuine and subsisting.

18. In such circumstances there are clearly material errors of law  in  the
    decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   Whilst  the  arguments
    relating to the parental relationship between  the  Appellant  and  his
    stepdaughter is concerned is such that a compelling circumstances  test
    should be applied is one that I am only briefly asked  to  touch  upon.
    However I do acknowledge that guidance from RK v SSHD (Section 117B(6);
    "parental relationship") [2016] UKUT 0031 may indicate that it does.

19. In all the circumstances I am persuaded that the correct approach is to
    remit this matter back for fresh hearing.  I am not persuaded  that  on
    the evidence that is before me I  should  merely  remake  the  decision
    allowing the appeal.  There are many factors relating to  the  specific
    circumstances of this case that have not been adequately  addressed  by
    the First-tier Tribunal and I am not in the process  now  of  rehearing
    evidence.  Consequently I find that there is a material error  of  law,
    remit the matter back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  rehearing  and
    attach directions for that rehearing.
