Representation:

For the Appellant:    Mr. T. Aitken, Counsel, instructed by Barnes Harrild
                    & Dyer Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr. C. Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In a decision promulgated on 23 January 2019 I set aside the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal in respect of the Appellant's return to the
    IKR.  I did not set aside the decision that the Appellant did not have
    a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.  The appeal
    before me was on human rights grounds, Article 3 ECHR.

The hearing


 2. The Appellant gave oral evidence.  He was assisted by the interpreter,
    Mr. Azad Karim, who confirmed before proceeding that they both fully
    understood each other.  The language spoken was Kurdish (Sorani).  Both
    representatives made oral submissions.  I reserved my decision.


 3. I have taken into account the documents contained in the Appellant's
    bundle (835 pages), the Appellant's supplementary bundle (8 pages), the
    Respondent's bundle and the skeleton argument.


Decision and reasons


 4. The case of AAH (Iraqi Kurds - internal relocation) CG [2018] UKUT 212
    (IAC) held as follows in relation to the lack of a CSID:

    "1.Whilst it remains possible for an Iraqi  national  returnee  (P)  to
    obtain a new CSID whether P is able  to  do  so,  or  do  so  within  a
    reasonable time frame, will depend  on  the  individual  circumstances.
    Factors to be considered include:

        i) Whether P has any other form of  documentation,  or  information
           about the location of his entry in the civil register.  An  INC,
           passport, birth/marriage certificates or an expired  CSID  would
           all be of substantial assistance. For someone in  possession  of
           one  or  more  of  these  documents  the   process   should   be
           straightforward. A laissez-passer  should  not  be  counted  for
           these purposes: these can be issued without any other form of ID
           being available, are not of any assistance in 'tracing back'  to
           the family record and are confiscated upon arrival at Baghdad;


       ii) The location of the relevant civil registry office. If it is  in
           an area held, or formerly held, by ISIL, is it operational?

      iii) Are there male family members who would be able and  willing  to
           attend the civil registry  with  P?   Because  the  registration
           system is patrilineal it will be relevant  to  consider  whether
           the relative is from the mother or  father's  side.  A  maternal
           uncle in possession of his CSID  would  be  able  to  assist  in
           locating the original place of registration of the  individual's
           mother, and from there the trail would need to  be  followed  to
           the place that her records were transferred  upon  marriage.  It
           must also be borne in mind that a significant number of IDPs  in
           Iraq are themselves undocumented; if that  is  the  case  it  is
           unlikely that they could be of assistance.  A  woman  without  a
           male relative to assist  with  the  process  of  redocumentation
           would face very significant  obstacles  in  that  officials  may
           refuse to deal with her case at all."

 5. I find that the Appellant does not have a CSID or Iraqi passport.  The
    Judge in the First-tier Tribunal found that the Appellant had "not
    proved that he has tried and failed to obtain documentation to enable
    him to return to Iraq, and the onus is on him in this regard".


 6. The Appellant provided a witness statement detailing his visit to the
    Iraqi Embassy in London on Thursday, 21 February 2019.  The Appellant
    states that he visited the embassy with a witness, Mr S.  He entered
    the building and spoke to an embassy official.

    "I informed the official that I had come to apply for an Iraqi
    passport.  The official asked whether I had my original Iraqi identity
    card documents, which I did not.  He told me that without such
    documents I would not be able to redocument myself and we were told to
    leave the building."

 7. Mr S has also provided a statement.  He states that he met the
    Appellant outside the Iraqi Embassy.

    "As we arrived inside the building at 10.20, I can confirm that RS
    asked the receptionist for his Iraqi documents such as birth
    certificate, Iraqi national ID and Iraqi national passport.  One of the
    staff members said he was sorry but RS was not eligible to apply for
    Iraqi documents because he did not have any Iraqi documents."

 8. The Appellant has provided photographs of him attending the Embassy as
    well as a receipt for his appointment (page 7 of the supplementary
    bundle).

 9. At the hearing the Appellant was asked by Mr. Avery in cross-
    examination whether he had explained to the Iraqi authorities that he
    had a sister in the United Kingdom who was documented.  He said that he
    had not.  When he was asked why, he said that he had only been asked
    for his documents.  He was asked whether he had asked the Embassy if
    any other documentation would be suitable, and he said that he had just
    asked for his passport and Iraqi ID.  They had refused to give it to
    him.

10. In re-examination the Appellant was asked whether the officials had
    asked whether he had the identity documents of other family members.
    He said that they had not but had just asked him for his own ID.  He
    had given them his ID from the United Kingdom, his ARC card, but they
    said that he needed to bring Iraqi ID.

11. The Appellant was asked whether he had spoken to his family about
    obtaining replacement documentation from the IKR.  He said that he did
    not have any contact with his family, and neither did his sister.  This
    was because he did not want anyone to know where he was, whether it was
    in the United Kingdom or anywhere else, and he did not want to risk his
    life.  He gave evidence that the last contact he had with his family
    was in 2015 when he had had contact with his mother.  The last time his
    sister had had contact with Iraq was at the same time.

12. I have carefully considered this evidence.  I find that the Appellant
    has been to the Iraqi Embassy in London.  He has tried to obtain
    documentation, but he has failed.  I find that he was told by the
    Embassy that, without ID from Iraq, he would not be able to re-document
    himself.  Given what he was told, I find that his sister's being
    documented is not relevant.  The Appellant's account of the attitude of
    the staff in London is consistent with the evidence given in AAH by Dr.
    Fatah.  "He has regular dealings with the consulate in London and he is
    not impressed.  He said that staff there are generally very unhelpful."
    [27]

13. The Appellant's evidence is that he has no contact with his family in
    the IKR.  This does not run counter to any findings in the First-tier
    Tribunal as no findings were made regarding contact.  The Judge states
    "given my Findings, he can return to his family", but it is not clear
    to what findings he is referring.  Although the core of his claim was
    found not to be credible, this does not mean that he is in touch with
    family in Iraq.

14. I find that the Appellant has three brothers and three sisters.  One of
    his sisters is in the United Kingdom.  His mother remains in Iraq.  The
    Appellant's evidence has been consistent that he does not have any
    contact with his family, and I find it is reasonably likely that this
    is the case.  I find it is reasonably likely that he is not in touch
    with his family, and that there are no family members who could assist
    with the re-documentation process in accordance with headnote 1(iii) of
    AAH.

15. I therefore find, in reliance on the evidence of the Appellant and Mr
    S, that the Appellant has tried and failed to obtain a CSID in London.
    I find that he would not be able to re-document himself with the
    assistance of family members.  I therefore find that the Appellant
    would be returning to Iraq without a CSID.

16. I have considered the other issues set out in AAH.  At the outset of
    the hearing it was accepted by Mr. Aitken, with reference to the
    Respondent's most recent CPIN, that there were direct flights to Erbil
    and Sulaymaniyah.  Therefore paragraphs [2] to [6] are not relevant.
    Paragraphs [7] to [10] state as follows:

    "7. Whether P would be at particular risk of ill-treatment  during  the
    security screening process must be assessed on  a  case-by-case  basis.
    Additional factors that may increase risk include: (i)  coming  from  a
    family with a known association with ISIL, (ii)  coming  from  an  area
    associated with ISIL and (iii) being a single male of fighting  age.  P
    is likely to be able to evidence the fact of recent  arrival  from  the
    UK, which would dispel any suggestion of having arrived  directly  from
    ISIL territory.

    8. If P has family members living  in  the  IKR  cultural  norms  would
    require that family to accommodate P. In such circumstances P would, in
    general, have sufficient assistance from the family so  as  to  lead  a
    'relatively normal life', which  would  not  be  unduly  harsh.  It  is
    nevertheless important for decision-makers to determine the  extent  of
    any assistance likely to be provided by P's family on a  case  by  case
    basis.

    9.  For  those  without  the  assistance  of  family  in  the  IKR  the
    accommodation options are limited:

       i) Absent special circumstances it is not reasonably likely  that  P
          will be able to gain access to one of the refugee  camps  in  the
          IKR; these camps are already extremely overcrowded and are closed
          to newcomers. 64% of IDPs are accommodated  in  private  settings
          with the vast majority living with family members;


      ii) If P cannot live with a family member,  apartments  in  a  modern
          block in a new neighbourhood are available for rent at a cost  of
          between $300 and $400 per month;


     iii) P could resort to a 'critical shelter arrangement', living in  an
          unfinished  or  abandoned  structure,  makeshift  shelter,  tent,
          mosque, church or squatting in a government building.   It  would
          be unduly harsh to require P to relocate to the  IKR  if  P  will
          live in a  critical  housing  shelter  without  access  to  basic
          necessities such as food, clean water and clothing;

      iv)  In  considering  whether  P  would  be  able  to  access   basic
          necessities, account must be taken of the fact that failed asylum
          seekers are entitled to apply for a  grant  under  the  Voluntary
          Returns Scheme, which could give P access to �1500. Consideration
          should also be given to whether P can  obtain  financial  support
          from other sources such as (a) employment, (b)  remittances  from
          relatives abroad, (c) the availability of ad hoc  charity  or  by
          being able to access PDS rations.

    10. Whether P is able to secure employment must be assessed on a  case-
    by-case basis taking the following matters into account:


       i) Gender. Lone women  are  very  unlikely  to  be  able  to  secure
          legitimate employment;


      ii) The unemployment rate for Iraqi IDPs living in the IKR is 70%;


     iii) P cannot work without a CSID;

      iv) Patronage and  nepotism  continue  to  be  important  factors  in
          securing employment. A returnee with family  connections  to  the
          region will  have  a  significant  advantage  in  that  he  would
          ordinarily  be  able  to  call  upon  those  contacts   to   make
          introductions to prospective employers and to vouch for him;

       v) Skills, education and experience. Unskilled workers  are  at  the
          greatest disadvantage,  with  the  decline  in  the  construction
          industry reducing the number of labouring jobs available;

      vi) If P is from an area with a marked association  with  ISIL,  that
          may deter prospective employers."

17. Considering these paragraphs in turn, I find that the Appellant would
    be returning as a single male of fighting age (7(iii)).  However he
    would have arrived from the United Kingdom.  I find that this would
    dispel any suggestion of having arrived from ISIL territory, and while
    it was submitted that he would still be at risk of torture, given that
    he would be coming from the United Kingdom, I find that he has not
    shown that he would be at risk of torture.


18. With reference to paragraph [8] of the headnote, I have found that the
    Appellant is not in contact with family members.  Paragraph [9] sets
    out the difficulties for those who do not have the assistance of family
    in the IKR.

19. I find that the Appellant would be unlikely to find accommodation in a
    refugee camp in the IKR (9(i)).  In relation to paragraph 9(ii) there
    is no evidence before me that the Appellant would be able to afford
    between US$300 and US$400 per month from his own resources in order to
    rent accommodation.  Paragraph 9(iii), which sets out the third option
    of accommodation, would be to squat in e.g. an abandoned building or
    tent.  Paragraph 9(iii) makes it clear that it would be unduly harsh to
    expect an individual to relocate to the IKR if he would live in a
    "critical housing shelter" without access to basic necessities.

20. Paragraph 9(iv) refers to the Voluntary Returns Scheme.   I find that
    the grant would only last for a limited period of time.  The Appellant
    would need to find employment to secure an income once that ran out.
    No evidence was provided, and it was not submitted by Mr. Avery, that
    the Appellant's sister would be able to financially support him from
    the United Kingdom.  Ad hoc charity is not a long-term solution.

21. The issues regarding the ability of an individual to secure employment
    are set out at paragraph [10] of the headnote.  There is 70%
    unemployment (10(ii)).  The Appellant does not have a CSID and so would
    not be able to work (10(iii)).  Patronage and nepotism are still
    important and there is an advantage for those with family connections
    (10(iv)).  Skills, education and experience are important (10(v)).  I
    find that the Appellant has never worked in Iraq having left there when
    still a child.

22. Therefore, while a Voluntary Returns Scheme grant may cover a few
    months of the basic cost of living, the Appellant would then need to
    find employment to cover these costs.  Taking all of the above into
    account, given that the Appellant has no CSID, has no family support
    and is not a professional or skilled worker, I find that he would be
    unlikely to find employment in the IKR.  Therefore, once any funds from
    the Voluntary Returns Scheme grant ran out, I find that the Appellant
    would not be able to afford accommodation or other basic necessities.
    I therefore find that the Appellant has shown that it would be unduly
    harsh to expect him to return to the IKR.
