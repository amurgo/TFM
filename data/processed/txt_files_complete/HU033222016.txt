Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Blair, Counsel, instructed by Babs & Co Legal
Practitioners
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In a decision sent on 30 July 2018 I set aside the decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Callow for material  error  of  law.   The  judge's
    error  was  a  failure  to  adequately  assess   the   two   children's
    circumstances in light of the  accepted  fact  that  both  are  British
    citizens.

2.   At the previous hearing before me Mr Avery for the respondent  accepted
    that the appellant was entitled to benefit from the Home Office  policy
    dealing with parents of British citizen children subject to the  caveat
    that it had still to be established whether the recent  arrest  of  the
    appellant in October 2017  meant  he  was  caught  by  the  criminality
    exception set out in that policy.  He requested time for the respondent
    to establish the nature and extent of the  appellant's  criminality  in
    light of the fact that the appellant's trial on charges brought against
    him had been fixed for 24 July 2018.  Accordingly, I  decided  to  list
    the case for a CMR, noting that "it may well be that  once  details  of
    the appellant's trial outcome are known, there will be no  need  for  a
    further hearing".

3.   At the  CMR  hearing  before  me  there  was  now  available  from  the
    appellant's solicitors a letter dated 31 January 2018  confirming  that
    the appellant's trial went ahead on 31 January 2018 and  the  appellant
    was convicted of two offences - common assault and criminal damage  and
    was sentenced to a conditional discharge for a  period  of  six  months
    together with costs of �330 and a victim surcharge,  the  total  amount
    payable being �400.  The letter notes that  the  conditional  discharge
    becomes spent after six months.

4.   Mr Nath requested an adjustment for  the  respondent  to  consider  the
    evidence now to hand regarding the appellant's conviction.   I  refused
    that request as the respondent has had more  than  sufficient  time  to
    ascertain the outcome of the trial set for 24 July.

5.   Mr Nath then submitted that I should set the case down  for  a  further
    hearing, as today's hearing was listed as a CMR.

6.   Ms Blair submitted that my previous direction had made  clear  that  on
    receipt of the information regarding the appellant's trial and outcome,
    I might decide to re-make the decision without a further  hearing.   Ms
    Blair pointed  out  that  the  appellant  had  been  of  hitherto  good
    character.  The offences were clearly at the low end  of  the  spectrum
    and not of the order contemplated in the Home Office guidance.

7.   I have decided there was  no  need  for  a  further  hearing.   I  have
    sufficient information to re-make  the  decision  now.   Mr  Avery  had
    already accepted at the error of law hearing that the  appellant  stood
    to succeed in his appeal, applying the guidance given by the UT in  the
    reported decision SF  &  Others  [2017]  UKUT  120  (IAC),  subject  to
    clarification as to whether his recent arrest  resulted  in  him  being
    caught by the criminality proviso.

8.   The appellant's recent arrest and conviction  are  concerning  matters,
    but the offences were at the minor end of the criminal  scale  and  the
    sentence of conditional discharge is one for  which  the  law  provides
    that the conviction will be spent in six months if there are no further
    offences.

9.   As Mr Avery himself indicated at the previous  hearing  criminality  on
    the lower end of the criminal scale is not such as to exclude a  parent
    of a British citizen from the benefit of the  Home  Office  policy.   I
    would observe that the original interpretation of this policy  was  the
    ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union  in  the  case  of
    Zambrano and that in Case C-304/14  CS  the  court  indicated  that  to
    preclude applicants from being able to rely  on  the  Zambrano  ruling,
    there would need to be evidence  that  the  person  convicted  posed  a
    present, genuine and sufficiently serious  threat  to  the  fundamental
    interests of society.  The appellant's offending falls  very  short  of
    such  order  of  seriousness.   Even  if  the  Home  Office  policy  is
    understood to  encompass  criminality  of  a  lesser  order  than  that
    identified in CS, it does not indicate that a parent would be precluded
    on the basis of a conditional discharge sentence for the  two  offences
    of relevance in this case.  I therefore  conclude  that  the  appellant
    should receive the same outcome as the appellants in SF and Others.

10.  For the above reasons; I conclude:

       - The decision of the FtT  Judge  has  already  been  set  aside  for
         material error of law.


       - The decision I re-made is to allow the appellant's appeal.

Anonymity direction made.
