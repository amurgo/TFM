                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D O'Callaghan, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The  Respondent  appeals  with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Herbert who, in  a  determination  promulgated  on  21st
    February 2014, allowed the Appellant's appeal against the Secretary  of
    State's decision to refuse him leave to remain  on  the  basis  of  his
    family and private life to  the  limited  extent  that  the  appeal  be
    remitted to the Secretary of State for reconsideration.

 2. Before me the Appellant was represented by Mr D O'Callaghan of  Counsel
    and the  Respondent  was  represented  by  Ms  A  Holmes,  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer.

 3. Both  of  the  representatives  were  in  agreement  that  because  the
    Appellant's application for leave  had  been  refused  with  his  human
    rights claim certified under Section 94(2) NIAA 2002, the Tribunal  had
    no jurisdiction to determine the appeal.  Accordingly I set  aside  the
    decision for want of jurisdiction.  Counsel for the  Appellant  advised
    that the certification was being challenged by judicial review  in  the
    Administrative Court which is the correct venue for  the  determination
    of the issue.






Signed                              Date 25.06.2014
