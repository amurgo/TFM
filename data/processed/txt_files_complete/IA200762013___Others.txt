                            DECISION AND REASONS



Background

 1. On 24th December 2013 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal J M  Lewis  gave
    permission to the appellants to appeal against the decision of Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal  Sangha  in  which  he  dismissed  the  appeals
    against the decisions of the respondent to refuse leave  to  remain  as
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants  in  respect  of  the  first  and  third
    appellants.  The second appellant's appeal as dependant  of  the  first
    appellant was also dismissed as were the  appeals  by  the  fourth  and
    fifth appellants who are similarly dependants of the third appellant.

 2.  In  granting  permission,  Judge  Lewis  noted  that  the  grounds  of
    application contended that the judge had  not  sufficiently  considered
    the issue of evidential flexibility in respect of  specified  documents
    submitted by the first and third appellants in support of  their  joint
    entrepreneur application.

 3. This matter first came before me in the Upper Tribunal on  8th  October
    2014 when Mr Khan submitted a skeleton argument in which an  additional
    argument in relation to specified documents was raised.  It was  argued
    that the respondent had misunderstood and  misapplied  the  documentary
    requirements  set  out  in  paragraph  41-SD  of  Appendix  A  of   the
    Immigration  Rules.   In  summary,  the  skeleton  contended  that  the
    specific requirements for a letter from a financial institution  and  a
    legal representative as specified in sub-paragraphs (c)(i) and  (d)(ii)
    of paragraph 41-SD were only relevant if  the  applicant  was  applying
    using money from a third party. But  this  was  not  the  case  as  the
    applicants were relying on their  own  personal  funds  in  the  United
    Kingdom in relation to which  they  had  provided  the  necessary  bank
    statements in their personal names.

 4. Mr McVeety indicated that he needed more time  to  consider  the  fresh
    issue raised in the skeleton which had not been seen by him  until  the
    day of the hearing.  He  was  not  prepared  to  withdraw  the  refusal
    decisions for consideration under the relevant Rules.  However  he  did
    agree that,  if  given  more  time  to  consider  the  new  issue,  the
    respondent would also consider whether or not it could be  agreed  that
    the determination showed an error such that the decision could  be  re-
    made by allowing it.

 5. In the circumstances I agreed to adjourn the matter on the  basis  that
    the point raised in the skeleton was Robinson obvious.  I also made  an
    appropriate direction for  the  respondent  to  consider  the  skeleton
    argument  and  to  notify  all  parties   of   the   results   of   its
    reconsideration of the  application  at  least  five  days  before  the
    adjourned hearing date.

 6. At the resumed hearing before  me  on  12th  January  2015  Mr  McVeety
    conceded that the respondent had not complied with the direction  given
    but indicated that, even if the  application  of  the  Rules  had  been
    wrong, the bank statements submitted by the first and third  appellants
    had to comply with the  requirements  of  sub-paragraph  (c)(ii)(4)  of
    paragraph 41-SD specifying that bank statements should show an  account
    in both names for an entrepreneurial team and not  in  the  name  of  a
    business or third party.  Thus, he argued, the error  in  consideration
    of the wrong  Rule  was  not  material  because  the  first  and  third
    appellants could not comply with the Rules in any event.

Error on a Point of Law

 7. After considering the matter for a few  moments,  particularly  in  the
    light of the skeleton argument, I indicated that I was  satisfied  that
    the decision of the First-tier Judge showed an error on a point of  law
    such that it should be re-made.  That was because it was  evident  that
    the judge had been misled by the respondent's reliance, in the  refusal
    letter of 15th May 2013, on the alleged requirement for a  bank  letter
    and a legal  representative's  letter  when,  as  both  representatives
    agreed, such documents were only relevant to an  application  involving
    funding from a third party as specified in the  various  provisions  of
    paragraph 41-SD(d) of Appendix A.  Although Mr McVeety argued that  the
    error was not material because bank statements had been provided  which
    also did not meet the requirements of the Rules,  it  is  evident  that
    matter was not considered by the judge and so it could not  be  assumed
    that the judge would have made a decision on that matter which favoured
    the respondent.

Re-Making the Decision

 8. Mr Khan indicated that  the  appellants  continued  to  rely  upon  the
    skeleton he had submitted and agreed that the  issue  was  now  one  of
    interpretation as to the requirement of the Rules  in  respect  of  the
    bank accounts submitted by the first and third appellants.   He  argued
    that the requirement in  sub-paragraph  (c)(ii)(4)  of  41-SD  did  not
    specify a joint account.  He asked me to conclude that the  Rule  could
    mean two accounts in separate names.  Further, he argued that, even  if
    he was wrong in  that  submission,  then  the  respondent  should  have
    written to the appellants, under the  flexibility  policy  set  out  in
    paragraph 245AA of the Rules, for further information.  The  appellants
    could simply have opened a joint account if the position had been  made
    clear to them.

 9. Mr McVeety argued that there was no ambiguity in the Rule and that  the
    flexibility policy could not apply where the document  itself  did  not
    exist.  The purpose of the Rule was to ensure that  a  team  had  joint
    funds available.

10. In conclusion Mr Khan emphasised that the required sum of  �50,000  had
    been available and the Rule could be interpreted on the  basis  that  a
    joint account was not required.

Conclusions

11. Although the respondent plainly  made  an  error  in  relation  to  the
    documentary requirements set out in paragraph 41-SD of  Appendix  A  of
    the Immigration Rules on the basis argued by Mr Khan  in  his  skeleton
    argument, the matter cannot be left there.  The respondent is  entitled
    to look at the applications by the first and third  appellants  against
    all the requirements of  the  Rules  despite  the  error  made  and  in
    response to the amended grounds.

12. Although the first and third appellants maintain that they provided the
    required bank statements, the Rules do not allow for  that  conclusion.
    Sub-paragraph (c)(ii)(4) of paragraph 41-SD states in relation  to  the
    recent bank statements required to confirm  the  amount  of  investment
    money available:

         "(4) the account must be in the applicant's own name only (or  both
             names for an entrepreneurial team),  not  in  the  name  of  a
             business or third party;"

13. In relation to that paragraph Mr Khan argues that it does  not  make  a
    requirement for joint accounts.  I disagree.  Giving the paragraph  its
    ordinary meaning and on the basis that the first and  third  appellants
    are clearly an entrepreneurial team (having both  applied  together  on
    the same day in relation to the same  business)  an  account  in  joint
    names was evidently required.  This was not provided in support of  the
    applications made. For example, the statement submitted  by  the  first
    appellant for an account with Nat West Bank is in  her  name  only  and
    shows only half of the necessary funds held in the account on 5th March
    2013 (although the funds had been completely  withdrawn  by  6th  March
    2013).  Without the total funds of �50,000 in an account in  the  names
    of both entrepreneurial applicants it would not have been shown to  the
    respondent's satisfaction that the total of funds was available.  Thus,
    the application had to fail in any event.

14. In reaching the above conclusion I have  taken  into  consideration  Mr
    Khan's argument  that  the  respondent  should  have  written  to  each
    applicant to point out the requirement for an account  in  both  names.
    The appellant relies upon the documentary policy set out  in  paragraph
    245AA of the Immigration Rule in force at the time of the  application.
    The type of documents which the  respondent  would  request  after  the
    application are those set out in sub-paragraph (b) of the  rule.   They
    are: a document missing from  a  sequence;  a  document  in  the  wrong
    format; or a document that is a copy or not an original.   It  is  also
    stated that the respondent will not request a document where one  which
    is specified has not been  submitted.   The  bank  statements  in  this
    appeal which are in sole names are simply the wrong documents  and  did
    not require the respondent to  write  for  fresh  ones.  They  are  not
    documents in the categories set out in sub-paragraph (b).   Thus,  even
    if the respondent had considered the correct Rule in  relation  to  the
    documents required, a study of the bank  statements  would  immediately
    have shown that they did not meet the requirements of the Rules as they
    were the wrong documents.  There would  have  been  no  requirement  to
    write to the first and third appellants about that.

15. For the reasons I have given  the  appeal  on  immigration  grounds  is
    dismissed.

16. Human rights issues were not raised at the hearing  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal or before me.
