               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms M. Chaggar, Counsel. No8 Chambers, Steelhouse
                 Lane,                       Birmingham B4 6DR (instructed
                 on a Public Access basis)
For the Respondent: Mr D. Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION ON ERROR LAW

   1. The Appellant had appealed against the decision of First-tier Tribunal
      Judge J. Pacey  whereby  she  had  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal
      against the Respondent's decision refusing leave to remain outside  of
      the Immigration Rules.


   2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne
      noting that,


       "In an otherwise focused and concise  decision  and  reasons  it  is
       nonetheless  arguable  that  the  Judge  failed  to   consider   the
       compassionate circumstances that apply  to  the  Appellant  in  this
       particular appeal".


   3. Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the Appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  can  be
      summarised as stating that the Appellant had  argued  firstly  that  a
      grant of leave outside of the Rules was possible. Secondly that  there
      were various factors which could have led the Judge to  conclude  that
      this was a truly exceptional case/compassionate case. Thirdly that had
      the Judge considered the Respondent's policy referred to as "Chapter 3
      -exceptional circumstances" then she might have come  to  a  different
      result.


   4. During the hearing before me Ms Chaggar developed her submissions. She
      said that all of the colleges that the Appellant had  applied  to  had
      Highly Trusted Status. There was no dispute about that.  The  HTS  had
      been revoked on three occasions with up to ï¿½20,000 spent and  lost  by
      the Appellant. He had done nothing wrong himself. Ms Chaggar  referred
      to the skeleton argument she had relied  upon  before  the  Judge  and
      pointed out she had raised the arguments she was now relying upon.  It
      was therefore necessary for the Judge to have  dealt  with  them.  The
      Home Office  published  policy  was  referred  to  at  the  First-tier
      Tribunal but is not referred to by the  Judge  in  her  decision.  The
      Appellant's case had not been challenged. The  Respondent's  case  was
      merely that he should not be treated favourably. There was a  material
      error of law.


   5. Mr Mills said that although the Reasons for  Refusal  Letter  was  not
      detailed and had not referred to the  Discretionary  Leave  to  Remain
      policy, there was no need to do so. It can be taken as read  that  the
      policymaker has it in mind and that the issues have  been  considered.
      Mr Mills said that there was therefore no basis for the matter  to  be
      sent back to the Secretary of State for the policy to be  applied.  Mr
      Mills said he acknowledged though that there  was  such  a  policy  as
      referred to by Ms  Chaggar.  Although  it  is  an  error,  it  is  not
      necessarily one which is material because it might not have led  to  a
      different conclusion.


   6. I had reserved my decision.


   7. The Judge's decision makes clear at paragraph 29  that  the  Appellant
      had been placed in an extremely unfortunate position through no  fault
      of his own. The Judge noted that the Appellant took all  proper  steps
      by ascertaining that the Colleges he  had  applied  to  were  colleges
      which were approved by the Home Office.


   8. I note too that the Judge was  indeed  referred  to  the  Home  Office
      policy in respect of Chapter 53 and exceptional circumstances.


   9. Appeals of students where the college they  had  enrolled  had  either
      closed down or had lost its status as  an  approved  college  are  not
      unusual or rare. In this case however, the fact that there  are  three
      separate colleges that lost their Highly Trusted  Status,  along  with
      the Appellant's background of having been accepted as being a truthful
      and reliable witness who has been  caught  up  in  the  situation  are
      relevant factors. In addition there is the fact that  the  Judge  does
      not appear to have set out in her  decision  the  Home  Office  policy
      which had been relied upon.


  10. Having considered the  grounds  of  appeal  and  the  matters  raised,
      despite Mr Mills' persuasive submissions, I  come  to  the  view  that
      there is a material error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal.


  11. In my judgment it was incumbent upon the Judge  to  set  out  why  the
      policy did not assist the Appellant in  this  unusual  case  with  the
      findings that she had made. It is likely that the result would  indeed
      have been different had she done so.


  12. In the circumstances I allow the Appellant's appeal. The matter  shall
      be reheard by the First-tier Tribunal.  The  findings  of  fact  shall
      remain. I  shall  not  remake  the  decision  now  because  up-to-date
      information in respect of courses and colleges is required.

Notice of Decision

15.   The original appeal involved the making of a material  error  of  law.
    Therefore the decision is set aside. The findings of fact shall remain.
    The matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing.

      There is no anonymity order made.
