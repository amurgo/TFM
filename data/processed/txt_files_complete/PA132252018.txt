Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss B Jones of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fujiwala, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a Sri Lankan national born on  22  August  1991.   The
    respondent refused his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection  in
    the United Kingdom and First-tier Tribunal Judge Bulpitt in a  decision
    dated 26 April 2019 dismissed the appellant's  appeal  on  all  grounds
    including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

2.   Permission to appeal was at first refused by First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Grant-Hutchison in a decision dated 30  May  2019.   Subsequently,  the
    appellant was granted permission to  appeal  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Pickup on 25 June 2019 stating that it is arguable that the  First-tier
    Tribunal materially erred in law by failing to adequately  address  and
    consider whether the  medical  evidence,  in  particular  the  scarring
    report supported the  appellant's  factual  account  but  instead  only
    focusing on the discrepancies between accounts given by the  appellant,
    to the different medical experts.  The judge opined that the  remaining
    grounds have rather limited merit but all grounds can be argued.

The First-tier Tribunal's findings

3.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge in his findings said the following  which
    I summarise.  He has considered all the evidence provided before coming
    to his decision.  It was agreed at the hearing that the  central  issue
    in this appeal is the appellant's credibility.   He  has  paid  careful
    attention to the two medical reports which have been  submitted  of  Dr
    McCoubrie dated 23 October 2018 and the report of Dr  Dhumad  dated  17
    April 2019.  Both reports conclude that the appellant is suffering from
    post-traumatic stress disorder.  While Dr McCoubrie diagnosed this as a
    minor complex post-traumatic stress disorder Dr Dhumad  concludes  that
    the symptoms are more severe.  Both  doctors  comment  on  the  adverse
    effect that this disorder might have on the appellant's recollection of
    events in the past.  However, notwithstanding the two  medical  reports
    there were many inconsistencies in the appellant's account which cannot
    be  explained  by  his  lack  of  memory.  The  judge  found  that  the
    appellant's symptoms of PTSD can be explained by other reasons such  as
    the appellant grew up during the civil war and no doubt would have been
    exposed to significant trauma as a result.

4. The judge did not believe the appellant's account that he  was  abducted,
   detained and tortured by the authorities in Sri  Lanka  as  claimed.   He
   took into account the country guidance case of GJ and others Sri Lanka CG
   [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC) and stated that the case finds that  payments  of
   bribes is common place to secure release in Sri Lanka.  The judge however
   did not accept the appellant's evidence that his uncle was able to  raise
   10 lakh rupees to pay a bribe for the appellant's release within four  or
   five days.

5. The judge considered the appellant's activities with  the  TGTE  diaspora
   in the United Kingdom and found that this would not put him  at  risk  on
   his return because his account of his detention has been  fabricated  and
   therefore do not come to the adverse attention of the authorities when he
   lived in Sri Lanka.


6. The judge dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  under  Article  8  of  the
   European Convention on Human Rights and found that the appellant does not
   enjoy family life with the wider family of his wife  in  accordance  with
   Article 8. The judge puts the question thus:  "The  fundamental  question
   which I consider below is whether the decision to  remove  the  appellant
   from the United Kingdom and thereby interfere with his family  life  with
   his wife is proportionate".  He then went on to say that the  appellant's
   wife's wider family would want to naturally support the appellant and his
   wife as much as they are able to do so.   It  is  quite  clear  that  the
   appellant's wife with their marriage and  intention  to  raise  a  family
   themselves had established their own family unit.

7. The judge went on to consider the factors in favour  of  the  appellant's
   removal and found that the appellant continues to  have  strong  familial
   ties in Sri  Lanka  who  can  provide  him  with  financial,  social  and
   emotional support on return.  The appellant's wife has retained  a  close
   connection to Sri Lanka and has also strong family ties  in  the  country
   where she is a regular visitor and they can continue family life with the
   appellant in that country.  The judge stated that the appellant  and  his
   wife married when they were aware that the appellant did not have settled
   status  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  expected  that  they  would   live
   separately, at least for a period of years and as such  the  respondent's
   decision is merely restoring their situation to  how  it  was  when  they
   agreed to get married.

8. The judge then considered the evidence of Mr Horrocks, a  social  worker,
   who stated that it would be in the best interests of the appellant's wife
   for the appellant to remain here with her in the United Kingdom.  He  has
   also said that both  of  them  received  considerable  support  from  the
   appellant's wife's wider family in the United Kingdom.   The  judge  then
   balanced the factors and found that the  appellant's  removal  would  not
   interfere with his private or family life in this country.

   The grounds of appeal

9. The grounds of appeal primarily argue that the judge has  not  considered
   what degree the medical  evidence  in  the  appellant's  scarring  report
   supports his account of torture in Sri Lanka and that  these  errors  are
   material as they  may  have  infected  the  judge's  overall  credibility
   assessment.  It was argued before me that the medical  evidence  provided
   is different to both doctors but it is not contradictory.  It was  argued
   that the judge overlooked the evidence of Dr McCoubrie's report  and  did
   not take into account the conclusions reached by him.

10. The second ground of  appeal  is  that  in  relation  to  the  objective
   evidence the judge did not give consideration to the extent to which  the
   appellant's account is internally  consistent  with  country  information
   about Sri Lanka from 2008  to  present.   The  grounds  assert  that  the
   appellant's account of his involvement with the LTTE involves fundamental
   and significant discrepancies but does not been taken  into  account  the
   appellant's  evidence  office  LTTE  activities  against  the  background
   evidence.

11. The grounds further argued that the judge  did  not  take  into  account
   that payment of a bribe is consistent with GJ where bribes are paid to be
   released from detention. The judge found at paragraph 36 that he did  not
   find the appellant's unsupported evidence about a bride paid by his uncle
   to be credible.  The judge did not give any reasons for his rejection  of
   the appellant's externally and internally  inconsistent  account  of  the
   circumstances of his release from detention.   The  judge  also  did  not
   consider that the appellant's escape from the country is consistent  with
   the ability of persons of adverse interest to escape the country  through
   the airport by the use of agents.

12. The grounds argue  that  the  judge  accepted  that  the  appellant  had
   attended TGTE events in the United Kingdom but finds that this  has  been
   for the sole purpose of boosting his fabricated  account.   However,  the
   judge did not take into account that even if the  appellant  participated
   in these activities in bad faith, nonetheless the judge had to  determine
   whether his activities in this country place him at individual at risk on
   return to Sri Lanka.

13. The judge did not consider that the  appellant's  association  with  the
   TGTE would become known during the redocumentation process that  he  will
   have to undertake with the Sri Lankan authorities in order  to  obtain  a
   travel document and he cannot be expected to lie about his activities  in
   the United Kingdom.  The case of UB (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 85
   was referred where it was found that TGTE membership or  association  may
   on its own carry risk on return is supported by that decision.  The judge
   did not engage with this risk factor at all and that is a material error.

14. In respect of Article 8 it was submitted that the appellant  does  enjoy
   family life with his wife's family and  that  the  judge's  reasoning  is
   thin.  The judge found that the appellant does not enjoy family life with
   the wider family of his wife which is  not  a  valid  conclusion  on  the
   evidence.  The appellant and his wife live with the  appellant's  parents
   and younger siblings and Peter Horrocks' ,  the  social  worker's  report
   states  that  there  are  strong  elements  of  interdependency  in   the
   relationship between the appellant, his wife and members  of  his  wife's
   family.  The judge did not take into account the report of Mr Horrocks in
   his evaluation of proportionality and his evaluation  of  whether  family
   life existed, applying the Kugathas test.

15. The last ground is that Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
   Immigration Act 2009 should have been addressed by the appellant  because
   the appellant has a close relationship with his  wife's  younger  brother
   who is 5� years old.  His best interests have not been considered at  all
   by the judge.

16. The grounds of appeal state that the judge did  not  take  into  account
   two previous decisions  dated  24  October  2010  and  Judge  Gillespie's
   decision of 11 July 2016 where Judge Gillespie found that  insurmountable
   obstacles also existed in relation to the appellant's wife  and  both  of
   her  younger  siblings.  The  appellant's  political  activism  could  be
   considered a very significant obstacle to his integration  in  Sri  Lanka
   pursuant to paragraph 276ADE.

   The hearing

17. I heard submissions  from  both  parties  and  Miss  Jones  adopted  her
   grounds of appeal and said that  although  Dr  McCoubrie's  evidence  was
   mentioned in the decision the conclusions reached by him were  not  taken
   into account.  She said that one of the scars on the appellant was  found
   to be highly consistent and  the  blow  to  the  head  was  found  to  be
   consistent.  She emphasised that Dr McCoubrie's conclusions in the report
   have not been fully evaluated and taken into account when considering the
   medical evidence.  She also emphasised that the judge  did  not  consider
   the redocumentation process which the appellant would have to go  through
   and where his diaspora activism would come to light and the perception of
   the Sri Lankan authorities of his affiliation with the Tamil group.


18. In respect of Section  55  and  in  respect  of  Article  8  Miss  Jones
   emphasised that the judge had not taken into account family life with the
   child of his wife's mother, her young brother of 5� years of age in  line
   with the case of Beoku-Betts where the family life of  everyone  must  be
   considered.


19.  Miss Fujiwala said that there are no material errors  in  the  decision
   of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and referred me to the case of S  [2006]
   EWCA Civ 1153 and K v Sri Lanka [2019] UKSC 10.  She said that the doctor
   is not entitled to make findings on  credibility  and  that  is  for  the
   judge.  The medical evidence talks  about  consistent  which  means  that
   there are other causes.   She  referred  to  various  paragraphs  in  the
   decision where it said that the appellant  did  refer  and  consider  the
   reports of both doctors.  In  respect  of  the  objective  evidence  Miss
   Fujiwala argued that the judge did not believe the appellant's  narrative
   and therefore the consistency or lack of consistency  of  the  background
   evidence  was  not  relevant.   She  accepted  that  the  judge  did  not
   specifically consider the risk to return to the appellant  after  finding
   that he had participated in dispora activities in bad faith in the United
   Kingdom but said that it is not a material error of law.  In  respect  of
   family life and the previous decision by Judge Gillespie she  noted  that
   the  decision  was  promulgated  in  2016  and  at  that  time  when  the
   appellant's wife was not married as the marriage took place in 2017.  She
   said that the decision of the previous judge did not  take  into  account
   that the appellant was now a married woman and had formed an  independent
   unit with her husband. She submitted that the wife has continued to visit
   Sri Lanka and even their marriage took place in  Sri  Lanka  which  shows
   that they have ties to that country and can return as a  family  unit  as
   per the findings of the judge.


Findings on whether there is an error of law

20. I have considered  the  findings  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Bulpitt with great  care.   I  have  also  considered  the
   arguments put forward in the grounds of appeal and oral submissions.

21. The first ground of appeal I will deal with is  the  Judge's  evaluation
   of the medical evidence which is the main issue upon what  permission  to
   appeal was granted.  The judge took into  account  the  medical  evidence
   that two doctors who had diagnosed the appellant with PTSD, although  the
   two doctors disagreed whether the appellant's PTSD symptoms were  "minor"
   or "more severe". This demonstrated that both doctors did  not  agree  on
   the severity of the appellants PTSD.


22. The Judge stated at paragraph 28 that he has paid careful  attention  to
   the two medical reports but did not set out the conclusions of the doctor
   about the appellant' scarring. The medical report described as a scar  on
   the appellant's knee which was characterised as  highly  consistent  with
   the appellant's history of it being a  bullet  wound.  The  scar  on  the
   appellant's  abdomen  was  characterised  as  consistent  with  a   brief
   cigarette burn. the scar and the muscular tenderness in  the  appellant's
   neck which although was not normally significant  but  stated  that  when
   taken  with  the  perforation  of  his  eardrum  is  consistent  with   a
   significant blow to the ear and side of the neck a  few  months  ago  and
   indeed this conclusion "is difficult to avoid". There  is  no  reason  to
   believe that the judge did not take into account this evidence, including
   the conclusions, but he took it into account  in  the  round  with  other
   evidence which he was entitled to do.


23. The judge found that the the appellant gave details of his torture,  for
   the first time, whilst  in  detention,  in  consultations  with  the  two
   doctors which was at a late stage. The judge took that into  account  the
   appellant's account of his torture at his screening interview was that he
   was "threatened and interrogated" and had made  no  mention  about  being
   tortured  which  is  very  different  to  him  being   interrogated   and
   threatened. In his primary information report, the  appellant  refers  to
   being "tortured in various ways" but gave no further details of the  type
   of torture at his asylum interview or in his original witness  statement.
   The judge  was  entitled  to  take  into  account  that  the  appellant's
   inability to give evidence about his torture until a very late stage went
   to his credibility about being tortured.

24. The judge also took into account the differences  in  the  account  that
   the appellant gave to Dr McCoubrie and that he gave to Dr  Dhumad  as  to
   the type of torture which caused his scars.  The appellant's  account  of
   his torture  to  Dr  McCoubrie  was  that  his  penis  and  scrotum  were
   forcefully squeezed and he was burnt with lit cigarette  butts  while  Dr
   Dhumand makes no reference to such a treatment in his report. Instead  Dr
   Drummond refers to the appellant being beaten on the soles  of  his  feet
   which is something that he did not mention to Dr McCoubrie.

25. The judge was entitled to find that the appellant's inability to give  a
   consistent account about the type of torture went to his credibility. The
   judge was entitled to find that the appellant's account  of  his  capture
   and detention in April 2018 has shifted and was vague and inconsistent on
   the evidence before him.


26. The judge found that the appellant's diagnosis of PTSD should  not  have
   interfered with the appellant's ability to give a  coherent  account  and
   found that the inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence undermine  his
   evidence and his claim.  The judge took into account the appellant's oral
   evidence which is set out from paragraph 29 of the decision in  which  he
   gives many examples of the inconsistencies in the evidence  and  came  to
   sustainable conclusions.  The  judge  noted  in  his  decision  that  the
   appellant's  answers  changed  and  that  he   was   evasive   and   made
   contradictory assertions about every aspect of his claim which  he  found
   to be indicative of a fabricated  account.  The  judge  was  entitled  to
   evaluate the evidence and place the relevant weight on it and there is no
   perversity in his findings on the evidence before him.

27. The judge considered the appellant's diagnosis of PTSD and at  paragraph
   35 was entitled to find  that  there  could  be  other  reasons  for  his
   condition other than being tortured by the authorities.  The  judge  also
   took into account the differences in the diagnoses by the two doctors  of
   the level of severity of the appellant's PTSD. There is no perversity  in
   this conclusion.

28. I do not accept the argument put  forward  by  the  appellant's  Counsel
   that the judge did not consider all the evidence in the round.  The judge
   makes reference to the evidence of both doctors, and indeed Mr  Horrocks,
   the social worker's report.  It is not required that a judge has  to  set
   out in detail every piece of evidence before him.   The  reading  of  the
   decision, in the round, makes it clear that the judge took  into  account
   all the evidence including the medical evidence and came to a sustainable
   conclusion as far as it relates to the appellant  claim  for  asylum  and
   humanitarian protection and I find that the grounds of appeal are more of
   a disagreement with findings of the judge.

29. In  respect  of  the  appellant's  diaspora  activities  in  the  United
   Kingdom, The judge did not specifically address the question that even if
   the appellant's  diaspora  activities  were  opportunistic,  would  these
   activities have put the appellant at risk on return. The judge found that
   the appellant's participation in demonstrations  in  the  United  Kingdom
   were opportunistic. The judge reached his  conclusion  upon  his  finding
   that the  appellant  had  not  come  to  the  adverse  attention  of  the
   authorities when he was in Sri Lanka having found that his narrative  had
   been fabricated to assist an asylum claim. In light of that finding  that
   the appellant had not come to the adverse attention of the authorities in
   the past, his attendance at a couple  of  demonstrations  in  the  United
   Kingdom does not constitute a material error in this case.

30. The evidence before the judge is sets out at paragraphs  32  and  33  of
   his decision, was  the  following.  The  appellant's  evidence  was  that
   following the end of the civil war in  May  2009  he  was  able  to  live
   without interference  from  state  authorities  until  his  claimed  that
   abduction on 10 April 2018. The  judge  found  the  appellant's  evidence
   about his political activity during this time  is  inconsistent.  In  the
   appellant's preliminary information form on 18 July 2018,  the  appellant
   stated he had worked for a Tamil political party  being  involved  in  an
   election campaign, collecting signatures in support of  an  international
   investigation into the civil war and providing direct  support  to  those
   participating in the hunger  strike  and  demonstration.  At  his  asylum
   interview however the appellant was asked if he had ever been involved in
   any activity or any politics against the government the appellant said he
   did not get  involved  but  helped  TNA  Tamil  National  Alliance.  When
   subsequently asked if he had been involved in anything else that could be
   seen as acting against the government the appellant replied nothing else.
   When the judge asked the appellant about his political activities in  Sri
   Lanka he was especially vague stating that he could not remember the year
   or month when he had collected signatures and eventually stating  "I  was
   not going to collect signatures my job  was  taking  photos".  The  judge
   found that these inconsistent  accounts  which  shifted  every  time  the
   appellant was  asked  to  provide  any  kind  of  detail  undermined  the
   appellant's credibility and suggest  that  he  is  constructing  a  false
   account.

31. In respect of the appellant attending demonstrations in  Sri  Lanka  his
   evidence was that he attended a heroes day commemoration in November 2017
   which directly led to his arrest  and  detention  by  CID  officers.  His
   evidence about his involvement changed from being only taking photographs
   of  the  event  to  driving  protesters  to  the  event.  Ultimately  the
   appellant's evidence became that his involvement in  that  event  was  to
   take photographs and videos and that it was this which brought him to the
   adverse attention of the state authorities. Despite this assertion and in
   his answer to the judge's questions that he had retained  digital  copies
   of the photographs he took, no evidence of his photography was adduced by
   him. The appellant's evidence about the photographs that he took and what
   he did with them is imprecise and as with other aspects of  his  evidence
   when probed shifted. In particular the appellant was  unable  to  explain
   why his photographs would be of interest of the  state  authorities  when
   there were numerous such photographs readily available and also when  the
   event was sanctioned by the government of Sri Lanka  and  it  passed  off
   without incident. Additionally the appellant gave  inconsistent  evidence
   about how many heroes day commemorations he had been involved in.


32. The judge found  that  the  appellant's  generalised,  inconsistent  and
   unsupported account of his involvement in the heroes  day  commemorations
   not to be credible. I find that a differently constituted Tribunal  would
   not find differently in respect  of  this  issue  on  the  basis  of  the
   evidence in this appeal. The appellant  ultimately  is  a  failed  asylum
   seeker who attended a few demonstrations in the United Kingdom.

33. In respect of Article 8 I found that the  judge  properly  assessed  the
   evidence before him and I do not accept that Judge  Gillespie's  decision
   was the authoritative assessment of the appellant's wife's position as of
   2017 in line with the case of Justin Surendran Devaseelan v  SSHD  [2002]
   UKIAT 00702. Judge Gillespie's decision was promulgated in 2016  when  he
   found that the appellant's wife's and her siblings return  to  Sri  Lanka
   would amount to insurmountable obstacles.  At  that  time  in  2016,  the
   appellant and his wife were  not  married  and  therefore  his  wife  was
   granted leave in line with her family.  Post decision  evidence  must  be
   taken into account and in the appellant's case it is that he and his wife
   have since married.  The judge found that the appellant and his wife  are
   a family unit and they can return to Sri Lanka  to  continue  with  their
   family life in that country where they still  have  family  and  cultural
   ties as demonstrated by the appellant's wife's visits to Sri Lanka.

34. The judge found that there is no family life pursuant  to  Article  8(1)
   between the appellant, the appellant's wife and her wider family  because
   she is now in a family unit with the appellant. The judge was entitled to
   find that the family life in the Article 8 sense did  not  exist  between
   the appellant and his wife with her  wider  family,  even  if  they  live
   together.  The judge referred to the social worker,  Mr  Horrocks  report
   where he stated that  there  are  "strong  elements  of  interdependency"
   between family members. The judge was entitled to apply the facts to  the
   law in accordance with the Kugathas test which  he  sustainably  did  and
   there is no material error in his reasoning and the  conclusion  that  he
   reached.

35. It was also argued that the  judge  fell  into  material  error  by  not
   considering the best interests of the  appellant's  wife's  5�  year  old
   brother. I find that the judge did not fall into material  error  by  not
   specifically considering the appellant's wife's  five-year-old  brother's
   best interests because his best interests are catered for by living  with
   his parents who are his primary carers.

36. I  therefore  find  that  the  judge's  findings  under  Article  8  are
   sustainable and without material error.
