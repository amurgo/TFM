Representation:

For the First Appellant:            Miss E Daykin, Counsel, instructed by

Bindmans LLP
For the Respondent:             Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal with  permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Khawar, in which he dismissed  their  appeals
    against the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse  their  claims
    for asylum.  The first appellant is the father of the second  appellant
    and it is the case that both are citizens of Mali who face  persecution
    if returned there.

 2. Judge Khawar heard the appeal on 16 January 2014 but it was only on  10
    July 2014 that his determination was promulgated.  As, for the  reasons
    set out below, the  appeals  are  to  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a fresh hearing on all issue it is unnecessary to set  out
    in detail the facts of this case which  are  set  out  in  the  witness
    statements, skeleton arguments and the refusal letters.

 3. The Secretary of State did not accept the appellants'  claims  nor  did
    she accept their claim to be of Malian nationality. Judge Khawar  found
    neither appellant to  be  credible  and  was  not  satisfied  by  their
    evidence as to their nationality, making no findings on nationality.

 4. The grounds of appeal against Judge Khawar's decision  are  in,  effect
    twofold:

          i) that he permitted a procedural error amounting to an error  of
             law in that, having initially  said,  after  hearing  evidence
             from the first appellant,  that he would adjourn the matter he
             later, having heard additional evidence  and  having  taken  a
             break  for  lunch,  then  indicated  that  he  would  not   be
             adjourning the matter, and in his  reasons  for  refusing  the
             adjournment,  without having heard submissions on this  issue,
             took into account the fact that the first appellant had  given
             ostensibly an entirely dishonest account of his case; and,

         ii) that his findings with respect to credibility were flawed,  in
             that he failed to make  proper  findings  in  respect  of  the
             second appellant,  and  in  particular  failed  adequately  to
             explain why his evidence was not capable of corroborating  the
             first appellant; and, failed to explain adequately why he  did
             not attachï¿½ weight to the evidence of the witness.

 5. At paragraph 58 of his determination Judge Khawar says

         "Although I was initially sympathetic  to  adjourning  this  appeal
         part heard, at the conclusion of evidence I  had  resolved  it  was
         inappropriate to adjourn by virtue mainly  of  the  fact  that  the
         appellant  had sought to raise a medical issue  which  he  had  not
         previously  disclosed.   He  was  questioned  as  to  his   medical
         conditions both during  his  screening  interview  and  his  asylum
         interview. The only illnesses he experienced  were  stomach  ulcers
         and asthma.  I also note that  he  is  represented  by  experienced
         solicitors who will undoubtedly have questioned the appellant as to
         any medical conditions he may have. Accordingly and particularly in
         view of the fact  that  the  appellants  has  ostensibly  given  an
         entirely dishonest  account in this case, I refused the application
         to adjourn this case on a part heard basis."

 6. It appears that the first appellant had left the hearing centre in  the
    belief that his appeal was to be adjourned. It was  only  later,  after
    the lunch break, that the judge changed his mind. Whether he  had  left
    is, however, unclear, but it is not necessary for me to make a  finding
    on that issue.

 7. Whilst I accept that it is open to a judge to  revisit  a  decision  to
    refuse an adjournment, in this  case  one  of  the  reasons  given  for
    refusing the adjournment is that the judge had formed a view  that  the
    first appellant, had ostensibly given an entirely dishonest account  of
    his  case.   That  conclusion  was  reached  before  the   hearing   of
    submissions in respect both of the first appellant and  of  the  second
    appellant, and thus was not permissible.  On  that  basis  alone  I  am
    satisfied that the refusal to adjourn the appeal for  did  involve  the
    making of an error of law such that the judge  permitted  a  procedural
    error giving rise  to  an  error  of  law.   The  appellants  did  not,
    therefore, get a fair hearing of their appeals, it not  being  possible
    to differentiate between the two appellants.

 8. It cannot be said that the outcome of  the  hearing  would  necessarily
    have been the same had there been an adjournment, and accordingly, I am
    satisfied that the error was material. For that reason, Judge  Khawar's
    decision must be set aside.

 9. In the circumstances I am satisfied that the only appropriate course of
    action would be to remit the appeal to be heard  afresh  by  a  freshly
    constituted First-tier Tribunal as it will be necessary to  make  fresh
    findings of fact in respect of all issue arising in these appeals.

10. Accordingly I remit the hearing to the First-tier Tribunal and for  the
    avoidance of doubt I make it clear that none of the findings of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Kharwar are to be preserved.  It  is  not  at  this
    point appropriate to make any further directions as these are  properly
    for the First-tier Tribunal but given that the  issue  of  whether  the
    appeals should remain linked, it would appear appropriate for there  to
    be  a  Case  Management  Review  before  the  appeals  are  listed  for
    substantive hearing.

11. I also make an anonymity order in respect  of  both  appellants,  given
    that the second appellant is  a  minor,  and  by  not  anonymising  his
    father, he would be identifiable.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

    1. The decisions of First-tier Tribunal Khawar did involve  the  making
       of an error of law and I set them aside.

    2. I remit the appeals to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  determined
       afresh; none of the findings  of  fact  made  by  Judge  Khawar  are
       preserved.

    3. I  direct  that  unless  and  until  a  Tribunal  or  court  directs
       otherwise, the appellant is granted anonymity.  No report  of  these
       proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any  member
       of their family.  This direction applies both to the  appellant  and
       to the respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could lead
       to contempt of court proceedings.
