For the Appellant:     Mr Hussain of Legal Justice Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge  Sarsfield
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 14th May 2013.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 1st January  1958.   She
    appealed against the Respondent's decision made on 13th September  2012
    to refuse to grant her entry clearance to come to the UK as a  visitor.
    The Respondent was not satisfied that she was  a  genuine  visitor  who
    would leave the UK at the end of her holiday.

 3. The judge dismissed the appeal and the Appellant sought  permission  to
    appeal in lengthy grounds. On 10th  June  2013  Judge  Davidge  granted
    permission.

 4. Although the Respondent put in a reply defending the determination, Mrs
    Pettersen, at the hearing, said she accepted  that  this  appeal  would
    have to be re-heard because it was not at all clear  what  the  judge's
    assessment of the witnesses had  been  and  his  conclusions  were  not
    supported by adequate reasons.

 5. The decision is set aside and must be re-made for the reasons  set  out
    in the grounds and acknowledged by Mrs Pettersen.

The re-hearing

 6. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant's daughter and from her niece,
    the Sponsor.

 7. In the original refusal the Entry Clearance Officer said  that  he  was
    not satisfied about the Appellant's circumstances in Pakistan.  She had
    said that she was widowed  and  supported  by  her  two  sons  and  she
    received a monthly rental income of 3,000 rupees (ï¿½19).  She provided a
    bank statement for each of her sons, neither of  which  demonstrated  a
    regular monthly income and  both  showed  recent  deposits  which  were
    inconsistent with the account history.  The Entry Clearance Officer was
    not satisfied that the origin  of  the  funds  in  the  statements  was
    genuinely available to her.

 8. The Appellant's niece, Zahida, said that she was sponsoring  her  aunt.
    She wanted her to visit the UK in order to meet two of her brothers who
    had never been to Pakistan and to see other members of the family.  She
    confirmed that her aunt received rental income from the  downstairs  of
    her property and lived with her two sons, one of  whom  ran  a  grocery
    shop and the other of whom was a tailor in the local  market.   All  of
    the family put their cash into a single pot of money.   She  said  that
    she thought that originally her aunt was going to come for six  months,
    perhaps not the whole time depending on whether she liked it but agreed
    that the application form said that she wanted to come for three.

 9. The Sponsor said that she fully understood the obligations which  being
    a Sponsor entailed and that she could assure the Tribunal that her aunt
    would return.  She understood the effect that that would  have  on  the
    other members of the family in terms of future applications if she  did
    not.

10. Farzana Bibi, the Appellant's daughter, also  gave  oral  evidence  and
    confirmed the Sponsor's evidence  so  far  as  the  Appellant's  living
    arrangements were concerned.  She was now pregnant and she  wanted  her
    mother with her.  She said that she wanted her mother to come  and  see
    her granddaughter who was only 2 years old. She would  only  be  coming
    for a short visit since all of her other relatives were in Pakistan and
    she lives with her two sons and her grandson to whom  she  is  devoted.
    She also said that her mother would come for three months.  None of her
    other relatives had come to the UK except for her maternal  grandfather
    who visited a long time ago and then returned.

Submissions

11. Mrs Pettersen said there were no  issues  so  far  as  maintenance  was
    concerned but she queried why there was no evidence for the  source  of
    funds in the bank account and was surprised that there was no record of
    the tenancy in the downstairs part of  the  property.   She  said  that
    there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  show   what   the   Appellant's
    circumstances really were in Pakistan  and  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's concerns had not been answered.

12. Mr Hussain submitted that the appeal should be allowed.  The  Appellant
    was a genuine visitor.  Most of her relatives including  her  two  sons
    and her grandchild lived in Pakistan, but her daughter and her sister's
    family lived in the UK and she wanted to visit them here.

Findings and Conclusions

13. I am satisfied that  I  was  given  wholly  credible  evidence  by  the
    witnesses today.  It is clear that the Appellant lives in a traditional
    manner with her two sons in Pakistan and there is no reason to conclude
    that she intends to leave them and come  and  live  with  her  daughter
    here.  This is not a case  where  there  has  been  large-scale  family
    migration.  The majority of the Appellant's relatives live in Pakistan.
     The Appellant has a perfectly sensible reason for wanting to visit the
    UK and ample incentive to return.

14. I accept that the way that the family run their  life  it  is  unlikely
    that they  would  be  able  to  produce  written  evidence  of  income,
    including tenancy income, but the oral evidence has been consistent and
    there is no reason at all to disbelieve it. I accept  from  Mr  Hussain
    that it is likely that the family put any money  that  they  have  into
    their bank account .In fact in all likelihood the sums deposited before
    the application was made were put there  because  the  family  believed
    that it would be necessary to establish that they  had  funds.   I  see
    nothing untoward in that.











Decision

15. The decision of the judge is set aside.  The  decision  is  re-made  as
    follows.  The appeal is allowed.

To the Respondent - Fee Award

I have allowed the appeal and a fee award is made.


Signed
