                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge S D Lloyd, promulgated on 2nd October 2017, following  a  hearing
    at Sheldon Court on 18th August 2017.  In the determination, the judge
    dismissed the appeal of the Appellant, who  subsequently  applied  for,
    and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal,  and  thus
    the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a national of Egypt, a male,  and  was  born  on  15th
    January 1980.  He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    20th May 2016, refusing his application for an EEA  residence  card  to
    confirm his right of residence in the  UK  on  the  basis  of  retained
    rights. The applicable provision is Regulation 10  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006.   The  Appellant  had  been
    married in Egypt to Anna Wiecxorek (the  Sponsor),  who  was  a  Polish
    citizen, and the marriage was by proxy on 3rd October 2000.  There  was
    a divorce certificate issued in Egypt on 27th April 2014 thereafter.

 3. The issue before the Tribunal was the exercise of the Sponsor's  treaty
    rights.  The  Respondent  had  accepted  that  the  Appellant  and  his
    sponsoring former wife had been divorced.  The Respondent also accepted
    that the marriage had lasted for three years.   It  was  also  accepted
    that for at least  one  year  during  the  time  of  the  marriage  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor had resided together in the UK.  The issue of
    the Sponsor's exercise of treaty rights was what provided the  decision
    maker with difficulty.  There  were  wage  slips  from  four  different
    employers, the latest of which was dated 3rd April  2011.   There  were
    bank statements showing payments between January 2011 and  April  2011,
    and also from June 2011 to July 2011.

 4. The Respondent did not accept that there was evidence of treaty  rights
    being exercised from July 2011 onwards.  In addition, a letter had been
    supplied from Agrofood MT Limited, which stated that  the  Sponsor  was
    employed there earning ï¿½8,800 in the tax year 2014 to 2015, along  with
    three pay slips for August, September and  October  2015.   These  show
    that the wages were paid in cash.   There  was  no  corresponding  bank
    statement.  Accordingly, the Respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    evidence demonstrated that the Sponsor was exercising treaty rights  at
    the date of the divorce (see paragraphs 9 to 10).

 5. During the course of his determination,  the  judge  had  stated  that,



         "The Sponsor had previously  been  granted  a  residence  card,  to
         obtain that he  had  to  have  produced  evidence  of  the  Sponsor
         exercising treaty rights.  They would therefore have been aware  of
         the importance of such documents.  It was also  asserted  that  the
         Sponsor obtained a permanent residence card.   This  assertion  had
         been put forward in the letter  from  the  Appellant's  solicitors.
         However there was no evidence of a card in the  papers"  (paragraph
         26).

 6. The judge also noted (at paragraph 27) how the  Appellant  in  evidence
    had stated that he did not know where his solicitors got the idea  that
    the Sponsor had a permanent residence card.  His explanation before the
    judge was that the Sponsor knew the same  solicitors.   She  had  known
    them since 2011.  The Appellant gave evidence  that  the  Sponsor  must
    have  shared  this  information.   The  judge  did  not   accept   this
    explanation.  According to the judge,  there  was  no  reason  why  the
    Appellant  could  not  produce  evidence  of  the  Sponsor's  permanent
    residence card if the information was shared as claimed.

 7. Finally, there was evidence before the judge (at paragraph 28) that his
    solicitors had signed a consent form from the Sponsor  permitting  them
    to obtain details from HMRC.  In the documents there was a letter  from
    HMRC detailing the Appellant's taxable earnings.  There  was,  however,
    nothing with regard to the Sponsor, as the judge pointed out (paragraph
    28).

 8. Accordingly, the judge concluded that the Appellant had not  been  able
    to discharge the burden of proof that was upon him.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application  state  that  the  judge  erred  in  falsely
    confusing himself with the assertion that the Appellant's  ex-wife  had
    acquired permanent residence through working in the  UK,  and  treating
    this as a claim that she had "obtained  a  permanent  residence  card".
    Secondly, there had been a delay by HMRC in responding to the  requests
    for information in relation to the sponsoring ex-wife.  The  Respondent
    Secretary of State should have assisted herself in this regard.   There
    is power in the Secretary of State to request these  documents  through
    the department  itself.   Thirdly,  the  judge  had  unreasonably  held
    against the Appellant his lack of knowledge of the Sponsor's  financial
    circumstances after the divorce when his contact with his  ex-wife  was
    limited.

10. On 6th November 2017, permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal on the basis that  it  was  entirely  arguable  that  the
    judge's approach was based on a factual error as to what  was  asserted
    by the Appellant's  representatives,  and  a  legal  error,  since  the
    Sponsor had no need to apply for confirmation  of  a  right  to  reside
    permanently.  She could not have applied  for  a  "permanent  residence
    card" as an EEA national.  What  she  would  have  applied  for  was  a
    "document certifying permanent residence" (see  Regulation  18  of  the
    2006  Regulations).   The  First-tier  Tribunal  also  held  that   the
    documents that were awaited from HMRC had now arrived, but at the  date
    of the hearing, it was arguable that the judge erred  in  treating  the
    policy as restricted to certain examples,  rather  than  asserting  the
    general point that it may be hard for applicants to get documents  from
    an estranged partner.  The outcome of the appeal could have  turned  on
    HMRC documents that had been requested, and as  a  routine  matter  the
    Tribunal could have issued directions  to  obtain  such  evidence,  and
    adjourn to await its arrival.  Thirdly,  that  an  adverse  credibility
    reasoning was unwarranted in relation to a  line  of  cross-examination
    which resulted in the statement  that  it  was  not  credible  why  the
    Appellant  did  not  have  knowledge   of   the   Sponsor's   financial
    circumstances, although he was estranged from her  (at  paragraph  31).
    Another adverse finding was made to the effect  that  if,  it  was  the
    Appellant's contention that his  ex-wife  properly  shared  information
    with a solicitors about her legal status in the UK, that  is  what  led
    them to suggest that she had a permanent residence card  (at  paragraph
    27).

11. On 21st November 2017 a Rule 24 response was entered to the effect that
    there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that  the  EEA  national
    was exercising treaty rights at the date of the  decision.   The  judge
    set out the reasons at paragraphs 15 to 32.

The Hearing

12. At the hearing before me the Appellant was unrepresented and  chose  to
    make submissions before  the  Tribunal  himself.   The  Respondent  was
    represented by Mr E Tufan, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer. The
    Appellant made two submissions.  First, that, as his  first  Ground  of
    Appeal made clear, as an EEA national, being a citizen of  Poland,  the
    Appellant's ex-wife could  only  qualify  for  a  "document  confirming
    permanent residence", and  she  would  not  have  been  issued  with  a
    "permanent residence card" to which the judge kept referring.   Second,
    and in any event, there was now evidence from HMRC, which  had  arrived
    late, which does confirm from the period 2009 right  the  way  down  to
    2015 that his ex-wife was exercising treaty rights in the UK.  If  only
    the judge had adjourned the appeal, to await arrival of this  evidence,
    which had already been applied for, it would, as a matter of  fairness,
    have allowed the judge to come to the correct decision.

13. For his part, Mr  Tufan  submitted  that  Regulation  15  of  the  said
    Regulations allow for recognition of permanent residence, whether  this
    involves EEA nationals or non-EEA nationals, and the judge had made  no
    material error of law in this respect.  Second,  the  fact  that  there
    was, as of 19th August 2017, HMRC evidence confirming the sponsoring ex-
    wife to have been working, this could only mean that it was now open to
    the Appellant to make a fresh application, to  include  such  evidence,
    such that a favourable decision could then be made for him.   Mr  Tufan
    also submitted that it was recognised in the well-established  case  of
    Amos that the Appellant can himself request the  Home  Office  that  it
    requests documents from the HMRC, and the failure of the  Appellant  to
    so do meant that he must now take the consequences of the late  arrival
    of this evidence.

Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

15. First, it has been the Appellant's case that his ex-wife, a citizen  of
    Poland, had only been issued  with  a  "document  confirming  permanent
    residence", and had not been issued with a "permanent residence  card".
    The judge, however, repeatedly refers to why, "there is no  reason  why
    the Appellant would not have been  able  to  produce  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor's permanent residence card" (paragraph 27), if that was  indeed
    the case.  The reason why this is material is because in so criticising
    the Appellant, his credibility is impugned on the crucial  question  of
    his wife exercising treaty rights for the requisite period in  the  UK.
    The reference to how "she had already obtained  a  permanent  residence
    card and would have already have had to have collated that information"
    (paragraph  31)  is  replicated  throughout  the   determination   (see
    paragraphs 27, 31, and 26).

16. Second, whereas Mr Tufan  is  correct  in  his  assertion  that  it  is
    possible to request the Respondent Secretary of State to apply  to  the
    HMRC authorities for tax documents of an ex-partner, the fact that such
    an application had already been made by the Appellant  himself,  cannot
    go unnoticed.  The judge observes how  "his  solicitors  had  signed  a
    consent form from the Sponsor permitting them to  obtain  details  from
    HMRC", and that although details had been provided by HMRC in  relation
    to the Appellant's taxable earnings, none had been provided in relation
    to the  Sponsor.   Nevertheless,  "it  appears  that  a  solicitor  has
    continued to pursue HMRC after the date that he  had  already  received
    his own information" (paragraph 28).

17. It is, of course, the case that such evidence has now been forthcoming,
    and was alluded to by the First-tier Tribunal in granting permission to
    appeal.  Leaving that aside for a moment, however, it is clear that  if
    the Appellant applied for Islamic divorce in  February  2014,  and  the
    divorce was finalised  under  Islamic  law  on  27th  April  2014,  and
    thereafter it was registered in  Egypt  on  24th  May  2015,  that  the
    Sponsor, who had previously been exercising treaty rights  in  the  UK,
    was still doing so as  a  jobseeker  and  as  a  worker,  so  that  the
    Appellant would retain rights of residence in the UK  under  Regulation
    10 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

18. Since the documents from the HMRC now produced do demonstrate that  the
    Appellant was correct arguably in the assertion that  his  ex-wife  was
    still exercising treaty rights, as a matter of  fairness,  the  hearing
    should have been adjourned to  enable  such  documentation  to  arrive,
    particularly as the judge had recognised that "his solicitors continued
    to pursue HMRC after the date that he  had  already  received  his  own
    information" (paragraph 28).

Notice of Decision

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed to the extent that  it  is  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, to be determined by a judge other than Judge S D Lloyd  under
    practice statement 7.2(a) because the effect of the error has  been  to
    deprive a party before the First-tier Tribunal of  a  fair  hearing  or
    other opportunity for that party's case to be  put  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

20. This appeal is allowed.

21. No anonymity direction is made.
