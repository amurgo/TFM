                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of  Judge  Boardman
    of the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 14th July 2016.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FtT and I will refer to her as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a female  Nigerian  citizen  born  20th  May  1950  who
    applied for leave to remain in  the  UK,  based  upon  her  family  and
    private life.

 4. The application was refused on 11th June 2014.  The Secretary of  State
    considered EX.1(b) as the Claimant's husband has  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the UK.  The Secretary of State did  not  accept  that  there
    were insurmountable obstacles to family life between the  Claimant  and
    her husband continuing outside the UK.

 5. The Claimant's private life was considered with reference to  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules, the Secretary of State contending that
    the provisions of this paragraph could not be satisfied.   It  was  not
    accepted that the Claimant had lived continuously  in  the  UK  for  at
    least twenty years, nor was  it  accepted  that  she  had  no  ties  to
    Nigeria.

 6. The Secretary of State did not consider that there were any exceptional
    circumstances disclosed by the application which would warrant a  grant
    of leave  to  remain  pursuant  to  Article  8  of  the  1950  European
    Convention  on  Human  Rights  (the  1950   Convention)   outside   the
    Immigration Rules.

 7. The Claimant appealed  to  the  FtT  pursuant  to  section  82  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act).   The  FtT
    heard the appeal on 27th June 2016 and found, after  hearing  evidence
    from the Claimant and  her  husband,  that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.

 8. The FtT considered the version of paragraph 276ADE in force at the date
    of refusal, and also the version in force at the date of  hearing,  and
    found  that  the  Claimant  had  no  ties  to  Nigeria  which  was  the
    requirement in paragraph 276ADE(vi) at the date of refusal,  and  there
    would be very significant obstacles to her  integration  into  Nigeria,
    which was the requirement  in  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  at  the  date  of
    hearing.  The appeal was therefore allowed with reference to EX.1(b) of
    Appendix FM in relation to family life,  and  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  in
    relation to private life.

 9. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  In summary it was contended  that  the  FtT  had  materially
    erred in law by failing  to  give  adequate  reasons  for  findings  on
    material matters, failed to take into account  material  evidence,  and
    committed a material misdirection in law.

10. It was contended that when considering  insurmountable  obstacles,  the
    FtT had not recognised the high  threshold,  as  explained  in  Agyarko
    [2015] EWCA Civ  440.   The  FtT  had  misdirected  itself  in  law  by
    reversing the burden  of  proof.   The  FtT  noted  that  the  evidence
    indicated that the Claimant had a brother in the USA who had  supported
    her  financially  for  many  years,  a  son  who   was   a   consultant
    psychiatrist, and a daughter, but found that there was no evidence that
    these relatives were willing or able to support the  Claimant  and  her
    husband financially.  The Secretary of State contended that the  burden
    of proof was on the Claimant to show that they could not.

11. The FtT noted that the Claimant's husband owns a  property  in  the  UK
    jointly with his daughter but there was no evidence the daughter  would
    be willing to consent to a sale of the property.  Again  the  Secretary
    of State contended that the burden of proof was not on the Secretary of
    State to show that the property could not  be  sold,  but  was  on  the
    Claimant if it was contended that the proceeds of  sale  would  not  be
    available to provide funds for herself  and  her  husband  to  live  in
    Nigeria.

12. It was contended that the FtT had failed  to  take  into  account  when
    finding that the Claimant's husband would find it difficult  to  obtain
    employment in Nigeria, that the husband was  working  in  the  UK,  had
    graduated from a UK university, had obtained  long-term  employment  at
    managerial level with a European multinational corporation,  and  would
    therefore have work experience and skills.  The FtT had not taken  into
    account the probability that the Claimant's husband would have  accrued
    a pension over his career, which would be available to assist  them  in
    resettling in Nigeria.

13. It was contended  that  the  FtT's  evaluation  of  the  insurmountable
    obstacles test was unsafe, and the same erroneous reasoning applied  to
    the consideration of paragraph 276ADE.

14. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Saffer of the FtT.

Error of Law

15. At a hearing before me on 14th February 2017 submissions were  made  by
    both parties regarding error of law.  Full  details  are  given  in  my
    decision dated 16th February 2017, promulgated on 22nd  February  2017.
    I set out below paragraphs  20-27  which  contain  my  conclusions  and
    reasons for setting aside the FtT decision;

         "20.     I announced at the hearing that  the  FtT  had  materially
             erred in law and the decision was set aside.  My  reasons  for
             reaching this conclusion are set out below.

         21.  The FtT misapplied the guidance in Agyarko and I set out below
             paragraph 21 of that decision;

             The  phrase  'insurmountable  obstacles'  as  used   in   this
             paragraph of the Rules clearly imposes a  high  hurdle  to  be
             overcome by an applicant for leave to remain under the  rules.
             The test is significantly more demanding than a mere  test  of
             whether it would be reasonable to expect a couple to  continue
             their family life outside the United Kingdom.

         22.  The FtT found that the Claimant and her husband will not  have
             accommodation in Nigeria, no  employment,  and  no  family  or
             friends to support them.

         23.  The FtT correctly set out the burden of proof in  paragraph  5
             of the decision but did not apply it.  It is my view that  the
             burden of proof has been reversed.  There was no evidence from
             the Claimant's brother, son or daughter, to indicate that they
             would be unwilling or unable  to  provide  financial  support.
             The burden on this issue  is  on  the  Claimant,  not  on  the
             Secretary of State to  prove  that  the  relatives  can  offer
             financial support.

         24.  The burden of proof was  also  reversed  in  relation  to  the
             property owned by the Claimant's husband in the UK.   The  FtT
             found there was no evidence to indicate whether  the  daughter
             would be willing to agree to sell the property  or  whether  a
             court order would be required.  In my view the FtT  misapplies
             the burden of proof here, failing to recognise that the burden
             lies with the Claimant, not the Secretary of State.

         25.  The FtT records that there is  no  evidence  to  indicate  the
             value of the property, and  the  amount  outstanding  under  a
             mortgage.  Again, the burden of proof has been reversed.   The
             burden is on  the  Claimant  to  prove  that  there  are  very
             significant difficulties to family life continuing in  Nigeria
             which could not be overcome or which would entail very serious
             hardship.  The Claimant does not discharge that burden  simply
             by providing no evidence.

         26.  I find that failing to recognise the high  threshold  involved
             in the insurmountable obstacles test, reversing the burden  of
             proof, and failing to consider material evidence, as contended
             in  the  grounds  seeking  permission  to  appeal,  means  the
             decision of the FtT on this issue is unsafe.

         27.  The FtT considered paragraph 276ADE briefly, at paragraph  38,
             finding that the Claimant succeeds for the reasons given  when
             considering the insurmountable obstacles test.  Those  reasons
             are flawed by error of law, and therefore the FtT  finding  in
             relation to paragraph 276ADE is unsafe and must  also  be  set
             aside.  There are no preserved findings".

16. Having set aside the decision of the  FtT,  I  granted  an  adjournment
    request made by Mr Singh so that further evidence could be prepared  on
    behalf of the Claimant.  Mr Singh suggested there should be a  remittal
    to the FtT.  I rejected this  suggestion,  having  taken  into  account
    paragraph  7.3  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statements.   I
    observed that there had already been two  substantive  hearings  before
    the FtT, as there had been a  previous  appeal  hearing  prior  to  the
    hearing by Judge Boardman, which had also been set aside by  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The hearing was therefore adjourned for a further hearing to
    take place before the Upper Tribunal, so that there  could  be  further
    consideration of whether or not there were insurmountable obstacles  to
    family life continuing outside the UK,  a  consideration  of  paragraph
    276ADE(vi), and Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

Re-Making the Decision - Upper Tribunal Hearing 27th April 2017

Preliminary Issues

17. I ascertained that the Tribunal had  received  all  documentation  upon
    which the parties intended to rely, and that both  parties  had  served
    each other with any documentary evidence upon which reliance was to  be
    placed.  The Tribunal had received the Home Office bundle with  Annexes
    A-R, the Claimant's bundle comprising 72 pages, and a letter  from  the
    Claimant's solicitor dated 19th April 2017 enclosing a copy of the land
    register showing the Claimant's husband and daughter as joint owners of
    a property in Barking.

18. Mr Singh submitted a further  letter  from  the  Claimant's  solicitors
    dated 5th April 2017 which was not on the Tribunal file, together  with
    a further statement made by the Claimant and  her  husband  dated  20th
    March 2017, medical records in relation to the  Claimant's  husband,  a
    letter from the Claimant's daughter dated 24th February  2017  together
    with a mortgage calculator, and a letter from the Claimant's son  dated
    24th February 2017.

19. Mr Singh advised that the Claimant and her husband would be giving oral
    evidence.  There was no need for an interpreter.

20. Both representatives indicated that they  were  ready  to  proceed  and
    there was no application for an adjournment.

The Oral Evidence

21. The Claimant gave oral evidence adopting the contents  of  her  witness
    statements dated 27th June 2016 and 20th March 2017.

22. The Claimant's husband Micah Nkire  gave  oral  evidence  adopting  his
    witness statements dated 23rd June 2016 and 20th March 2017.

23. The Claimant and her husband were questioned  by  both  representatives
    and I  have  recorded  all  questions  and  answers  in  my  Record  of
    Proceedings.  It is not necessary to reiterate them here.  If  relevant
    I will refer to the oral evidence when I set  out  my  conclusions  and
    reasons.

24. In very brief summary both the Claimant and  her  husband  stated  that
    they could not live in Nigeria.  They have no accommodation  there,  no
    family or friends, and would have no employment.  Their adult  children
    would not be able to provide them with financial support.  The Claimant
    stated that her husband had retired, but his evidence was  that  he  is
    still in full employment although his 65th birthday was the day  before
    the hearing.  He earned �22,000 per year as  a  mental  health  support
    worker.

The Secretary of State's Submissions

25. Mr Mills submitted that the insurmountable obstacles  test  is  a  high
    hurdle and the Claimant had not proved  that  insurmountable  obstacles
    existed which would prevent her from continuing family  life  with  her
    husband in Nigeria.

26. Mr Mills described the letters from the Claimant's  adult  children  as
    unhelpful.  They did not provide any evidence of income.  It was  clear
    from the evidence that the Claimant's son is a consultant  psychiatrist
    currently living in Canada.  It is unclear whether he has  any  family,
    as the Claimant and her husband had given conflicting evidence on this.
      The  Claimant's  daughter   lives   in   Switzerland.    She   is   a
    telecommunications engineer.

27. No evidence was given by the Claimant as  to  the  cost  of  living  in
    Nigeria, and no evidence given of the value of the  property  owned  in
    the UK, and no evidence given as to the amount of mortgage outstanding.
     Mr Mills submitted that the Claimant and her family appeared  to  want
    to hide assets.

28. Mr Mills pointed out that the Claimant's husband had confirmed that  he
    is still working, although the Claimant had stated that he had  stopped
    work.  There was no evidence to show that he could not work in Nigeria.
     He would be entitled to a British state pension on his  65th  birthday
    which was the day before the Tribunal hearing.

29. With reference to the health of the Claimant's husband,  there  was  no
    evidence to indicate that any medical treatment required would  not  be
    available in Nigeria.  It was accepted that he suffers from diabetes.

30. Mr Mills submitted that the Claimant's appeal should be  dismissed,  as
    it had not been proved that  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life continuing outside the UK, nor had it been proved that  the
    Claimant had no ties to Nigeria.

31. With reference to Article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules,  Mr  Mills
    submitted that there were no exceptional circumstances  which  had  not
    been considered within the  Immigration  Rules.   Pursuant  to  section
    117B, of the 2002 Act little weight should be given to any private life
    established by the Claimant  because  she  has  been  in  this  country
    unlawfully.

The Claimant's Submissions

32. Mr Singh had not prepared a written skeleton  argument.   In  his  oral
    submissions   he   contended   that   the   evidence   indicated   that
    insurmountable obstacles existed to family life continuing in  Nigeria.
    I was asked to find both the Claimant and  her  husband  credible.   Mr
    Singh described them as open and honest, and they were  not  trying  to
    hide evidence.  Mr Singh submitted that it was entirely plausible  that
    they did not know the income of their adult children.  I was  asked  to
    accept  the  evidence  that  the  Claimant  and  her  husband  had   no
    accommodation, friends or family in Nigeria.

33. I was asked to accept that the adult children had made  it  clear  that
    they could not financially support  their  parents  if  they  lived  in
    Nigeria.  Mr Singh contended that it was unlikely that  the  Claimant's
    husband would be able to find  employment  in  Nigeria.   It  was  also
    unclear whether he would  receive  a  UK  state  pension  if  he  lived
    permanently in Nigeria.

34. I was asked to note that the Claimant and her husband are elderly,  and
    the husband does have medical issues.  If the Claimant's appeal was not
    allowed pursuant  to  Appendix  FM  in  relation  to  family  life,  or
    paragraph 276ADE(vi) in relation to private life, I was asked to  allow
    the appeal pursuant to Article 8 outside  the  Immigration  Rules.   Mr
    Singh submitted that it  would  be  appropriate  to  allow  the  appeal
    outside the rules, taking into account the total length  of  time  that
    the Claimant had spent in the UK, and she had resided here  with  leave
    for some of that time.

35. I was asked to find that it would be disproportionate for the  Claimant
    to leave the UK, with her husband remaining here, and for her  to  make
    an entry clearance application  from  Nigeria.   It  would  be  equally
    disproportionate for them both to have to leave this country.  Mr Singh
    submitted that her husband classed his wife as his primary  carer  even
    though he was in full-time employment.

36. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

37. The burden of  proof  is  on  the  Claimant  to  show  that  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK,  and
    the standard of proof is a balance of probability.

38. The Claimant also relies upon paragraph 276ADE(vi) and I must  consider
    the version in force at the date  of  the  Respondent's  refusal.   The
    Claimant must prove that she has no ties, including social, cultural or
    family with Nigeria.  Again, the standard of  proof  is  a  balance  of
    probability.  With reference  to  Article  8  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules, the Claimant must prove that she has established a family and/or
    private life that engages Article 8, it is then for the  Respondent  to
    establish any public interest factors weighing  against  the  Claimant.
    The standard of proof is a balance of probabilities.

39. I make the following findings of fact.  The Claimant  and  Micah  Nkire
    are married.  They are both Nigerian citizens.  They have a son who  is
    42 years of age, and a consultant psychiatrist living in Canada.   They
    have  a  daughter  who  is  36  years  of  age,  currently  working  in
    Switzerland.

40. The Claimant's husband studied in the UK.   He  was  resident  in  this
    country between 1974  and  1981.   In  1981  after  he  graduated  from
    university he went to work for Unilever in  Nigeria.   He  remained  in
    Nigeria until 1998 and returned to the UK as a visitor on 16th November
    1998.  When his visit visa expired he remained without  leave  and  was
    eventually granted indefinite leave to remain on 29th June 2011.

41. The Claimant was in the UK between August 1976 and  1987  although  she
    made trips to and  from  Nigeria  during  that  period.   In  1987  she
    returned to Nigeria to live with her husband, leaving the  children  in
    the UK.  The Claimant remained living in Nigeria until she returned  to
    the UK as a visitor on  8th  July  2007.   Her  leave  expired  on  4th
    December 2007, and thereafter she has remained without leave.

42. I am satisfied that the Claimant's husband owns a property in  Barking,
    which he purchased in 2000 together with his daughter.  I am  satisfied
    that the Claimant's husband is  still  in  employment  with  an  annual
    income of �22,000.  He has been working as a  care  or  support  worker
    since approximately 1999.

43. I find it appropriate to firstly consider section EX  of  Appendix  FM.
    EX.1(a) is not relevant because that relates to children under the  age
    of 18.  I set out below EX.1(b) and EX.2;

         EX.1 (b) the applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
                    with a partner who  is  in  the  UK  and  is  a  British
                    citizen, settled in the UK or in  the  UK  with  refugee
                    leave  or  humanitarian  protection,   and   there   are
                    insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with   that
                    partner continuing outside the UK.

         EX.2  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph   EX.1(b)   "insurmountable
                obstacles" means the  very  significant  difficulties  which
                would  be  faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner  in
                continuing their family life together  outside  the  UK  and
                which could not be overcome or  would  entail  very  serious
                hardship for the applicant or their partner.

44. The Supreme Court considered insurmountable  obstacles  and  Article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11.  It was  found
    that the requirement of insurmountable obstacles is a stringent test to
    be  met,  and  the  definition  contained  within  EX.2  was  approved.
    Although insurmountable obstacles imposed a stringent test,  this  must
    be interpreted  in  a  sensible  and  practical  way,  rather  than  as
    referring solely to obstacles which make it literally impossible for  a
    family to live together in the applicant's country of origin.

45. If an applicant failed to meet the requirements of the rules, it should
    only be in genuinely exceptional circumstances that refusing them leave
    and removing them from the UK would breach Article 8.  The  exceptional
    circumstances would need to result in unjustifiably harsh  consequences
    which would make refusal of the application disproportionate.   It  was
    found in Agyarko that the  fact  that  the  Claimant's  partner  was  a
    British citizen and had employment in the UK, could not, without  more,
    amount to insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing  outside
    the UK.

46. I do not find that the Claimant has proved insurmountable obstacles  to
    family life continuing in Nigeria.  I reach  this  conclusion  for  the
    following reasons.

47. Both the Claimant and her husband are Nigerian citizens.  I accept that
    the Claimant's husband has indefinite leave to remain  in  the  UK  and
    this was granted in 2011, but he is not a British  citizen.   Both  the
    Claimant and her husband have lived in Nigeria  for  longer  than  they
    have lived in the UK.

48. I do not find that they would be unable to  accommodate  themselves  in
    Nigeria.  They have a property in the UK which could be sold, with  the
    proceeds of sale being used to support them and  provide  accommodation
    in Nigeria.  Although the Claimant has  not  disclosed  the  amount  of
    mortgage, I find that it must be relatively small, as  her  husband  in
    oral evidence indicated when cross-examined that the mortgage would  be
    totally paid off within one or two years.  The Claimant's husband  gave
    evidence that he had made the majority of the mortgage repayments,  and
    therefore he would be entitled to a minimum of 50% of the  proceeds  of
    sale.

49. The Claimant's husband has not  proved  that  he  would  be  unable  to
    receive his UK pension in Nigeria.  It is  not  for  the  Secretary  of
    State to prove that this would be paid.

50. It has not been proved that  the  Claimant's  husband  could  not  find
    employment.   He  has  previously  worked  in  Nigeria.   He  is   well
    qualified.  He is currently working in the UK.  If it is contended that
    employment would not be available,  the  burden  of  proof  is  on  the
    Claimant.  It has not been discharged.

51. No medical issues have been raised in relation  to  the  Claimant.   In
    relation to her husband, it has not been proved that medical  treatment
    would not be available in Nigeria.  Medical records indicate  that  the
    Claimant's husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in December  2013
    and glaucoma in August 2016.  According to his medical records he  last
    had a consultation at Moorfields Eye Hospital on 17th January 2017, and
    is due to have a further appointment on 18th July 2017.  The Claimant's
    husband is receiving medication in the form of eye drops  and  tablets,
    but there is no evidence to show that  this  medication  would  not  be
    available in Nigeria.  The Claimant has claimed  to  be  her  husband's
    carer, but I find this to be  exaggerated.   It  is  evident  that  the
    husband is in full-time employment.

52. The Claimant indicated to the  FtT,  that  when  she  was  resident  in
    Nigeria without her husband, her brother in the United States  used  to
    provide some financial support.  That stopped when she returned to  the
    UK.  No satisfactory evidence  has  been  given  to  indicate  that  if
    necessary, financial support could not be provided  by  the  Claimant's
    brother, or her adult children.  Neither of the children  has  provided
    any evidence of their income  or  outgoings.   There  is  therefore  no
    evidence that they could not offer financial support to  their  parents
    if it was required.

53. I appreciate that the Claimant and her husband want to live in the  UK.
    That however is not the test that I must consider.  There would be some
    disruption to their lives  if  they  moved  to  Nigeria.   However  the
    evidence does not  indicate  that  they  would  face  very  significant
    difficulties in Nigeria which could not be overcome,  or  would  entail
    very serious hardship.

54. In considering paragraph 276ADE(vi) I take into  account  the  guidance
    given in Ogundimu Nigeria [2013] UKUT 00060  (IAC).   Consideration  of
    whether a person has no ties  to  a  country  must  involve  a  rounded
    assessment of all the relevant circumstances, and is not to be  limited
    to social, cultural and  family  circumstances.   I do  not  find  the
    Claimant has proved she has no ties to Nigeria.  She has  spent  longer
    living in Nigeria than she has in the UK.  She is  a  citizen  of  that
    country.  There would be no language difficulties.  The Claimant  is  a
    member of a  church  which  the  Respondent  pointed  out  had  several
    branches in Nigeria, and this has not been disputed.   The  test  under
    paragraph 276ADE(vi) is an exacting one, and the Claimant has failed to
    prove that she has no ties to Nigeria.

55. In considering Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules I have regard to
    the considerations set out in  section  117B  of  the  2002  Act.   The
    maintenance  of  effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the   public
    interest.

56. I accept that the Claimant can speak English, but  this  is  a  neutral
    factor.  The Claimant is not financially independent  herself,  but  is
    dependent financially upon her husband.

57. I must attach little weight to the  private  life  established  by  the
    Claimant because it  has  been  established  when  she  has  been  here
    unlawfully.

58. The Claimant entered the United Kingdom as  a  visitor  in  2007.   She
    therefore must have indicated to the Entry Clearance Officer  that  she
    intended to return to Nigeria at that time.  She did not  do  so.   She
    has remained here without leave and she joined her husband who at  that
    time was also here unlawfully.

59.  I  do  not  find  that  there  are  any  compelling   or   exceptional
    circumstances which have not  been  considered  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

60. It is clear that the Claimant and her husband wish to remain in the UK,
    but I find the weight that must be attached to the public  interest  in
    maintaining effective immigration controls, outweighs the weight to  be
    attached to their wishes.  It is  not  of  course  the  case  that  the
    Claimant's husband must leave the  UK.   He  has  indefinite  leave  to
    remain, and if he wishes to remain in this country then he will do  so.



61. An alternative to the couple relocating to Nigeria, would  be  for  the
    Claimant to leave the UK, and to return to Nigeria  to  make  an  entry
    clearance application as the spouse of  a  person  settled  here.   She
    would then need to provide all the evidence required under Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules.  It would seem that  the  Claimant's  husband
    could support her application financially, as  he  claims  to  have  an
    income of �22,000 per annum, which is above the minimum  annual  income
    requirement of �18,600.  The specified evidence would however  have  to
    be produced.  In considering  this  issue,  I take  into  account  the
    guidance in R (on the application of Chen) (Appendix FM - Chikwamba -
    temporary separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT  00189  (IAC).
    This confirmed that it is not enough to rely solely upon the  case  law
    concerning Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40, but if temporary separation
    to enable an individual to make an application for entry clearance  was
    claimed to be disproportionate, the Claimant must provide evidence that
    such  temporary  separation  would  interfere  disproportionately  with
    protected rights.  No satisfactory evidence  to  prove  that  has  been
    submitted in this case.

62. I therefore conclude the Claimant has failed to prove  that  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in Nigeria, she  has
    failed to prove that she has no ties  to  Nigeria,  and  there  are  no
    compelling or exceptional circumstances which  would  justify  allowing
    the appeal pursuant to Article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    Claimant has not proved  that  it  would  be  disproportionate,  as  an
    alternative to relocating with her  husband  in  Nigeria,  for  her  to
    return to Nigeria to make an entry clearance  application  through  the
    proper channels, and provide the specified evidence.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and  was
set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.  The Claimant's appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

No anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no request for anonymity made to the Upper Tribunal and I  see  no  need  to
make an anonymity order.
