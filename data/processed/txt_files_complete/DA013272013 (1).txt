For the Appellant:     Ms G Peterson, Counsel instructed by CK Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Jack, HOPO


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW


1.   The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  (FtTJ  Lester  and  Ms  J  A
    Endersby (NLM)) allowing  the  appeal  of  the  appellant  against  the
    deportation order made against him by virtue of section 32(5) of the UK
    Borders Act 2007 dated 28 June 2013.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on 15 July  1980.   He  came
    to the UK aged 14 on  23  November  1994  as  a  visitor  and  made  an
    application to settle in the UK with his father, Mr Donald Forester  as
    his dependant child.  The application was refused by  the  Home  Office
    but after various appeal hearings, the Home Office decided on  18  July
    2000, to grant the appellant indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

3.   On 12 August 2011, at the age of 21, the  appellant  was  convicted  at
    wood Green Crown Court of  possession  of  class  A  controlled  drugs,
    heroin and cocaine, with intent to supply, for which he  was  sentenced
    to four years' imprisonment.  He was also  subject  to  a  confiscation
    order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 for �20,905 or in default to
    serve twelve months' imprisonment consecutive to the term of custody he
    is liable to serve  for  the  substantive  offence.   The  benefit  was
    calculated at �62,307.46.

4.   In granting permission, UTJ Latter said that the grounds satisfied  him
    that it is  arguable  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  give
    adequate weight to  the  public  interest,  particularly,  taking  into
    account the length of the appellant's sentence, the fact that  he  fell
    within the provisions of paragraph 398(a) of the Immigration Rules  and
    the observations of the Court of Appeal in SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ
    550.

5.   I find that as the appellant's offence engages paragraph 398(a) of  the
    Immigration Rules, the Tribunal were right to find that paragraphs  399
    and 399A did not apply.  I note that whilst the Tribunal at  paragraphs
    46, 47 and 48 made mention of SS (Nigeria) and MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA
    Civ  1192  and  reminded  themselves  that  the  public   interest   in
    deportation will only be outweighed  by  exceptional  circumstances,  I
    find  that  the  Tribunal  failed  to  adopt  this  approach  in  their
    consideration of the appellant's appeal.  This is because the  Tribunal
    at  the  end  of  paragraph  48  interpreted  the  phrase  "exceptional
    circumstances" to mean the "weighing of the competing factors  for  and
    against deportation" of foreign criminals.  In MF  (Nigeria)  the  word
    "exceptional" was held to  mean  "circumstances  in  which  deportation
    would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual  or
    their family such that a deportation would not be proportionate.  As  a
    consequence the Tribunal at paragraph 50 set out the  factors  weighing
    in the balance against deportation; and at paragraph  51  set  out  the
    factors in favour of deportation.  The  first  four  bullet  points  at
    paragraph 51 were references to the appellant's criminal  offences.   I
    do not consider that these references amount  to  adequate  and  proper
    consideration of the weight to be attached to the public interest.

6.   I also find that  at  paragraph  49  the  Tribunal  adopted  the  wrong
    approach  by  carrying  out  a  conventional  article  8  analysis   in
    paragraphs 50 and 51 without first applying  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules and only if there may be arguably  good  grounds  for
    granting leave to remain outside them is it  necessary  for  Article  8
    purposes  to  go  on  to  consider   whether   there   are   compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under  them.   This  is  the
    approach set out by the Upper  Tribunal  at  paragraph  31  of  Shahzad
    (Article 8: legitimate aim) Pakistan [2014] UKUT 85 (IAC).

7.   Accordingly, I accept Mr Jack's argument that the  Tribunal  failed  to
    give adequate weight to the public interest, particularly, taking  into
    account the length of the appellant's sentence, the fact that  he  fell
    within the provisions of paragraph 398(a) of the Immigrations  and  the
    observations of the Court of Appeal in SS (Nigeria).

8.   In terms of his risk of serious harm, the OASys Report  indicated  that
    he was at medium risk of serious harm.  The letter from the appellant's
    offender manager said that the  group  re-conviction  scores  indicated
    that he was at low risk of re-offending.  Whilst the panel found in the
    appellant's favour that his re-offending was described  as  low,  there
    was no discussion that he was at medium risk of serious harm.

9.   I also find that the Tribunal placed undue weight  on  the  appellant's
    relationship with his daughter and in so doing appeared to consider her
    best interests as a trump card  and  not  one  of  the  matters  to  be
    considered in a proportionality balancing exercise.

10.  The Tribunal made the finding  that  it  is  quite  possible  that  his
    daughter would exert a positive influence on her father so that she did
    not return to drugs.  The Tribunal failed to give any reason for  their
    finding given that there was no evidence that his daughter had  exerted
    a positive influence on him in the past.

11.   For  all  these  reasons  I  find  that  the  Tribunal's  decision  is
    materially flawed.  It cannot stand.  It has to be re-made.

12.  I remit this appeal for re-hearing at Taylor  House  by  a  differently
    constituted Tribunal other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Lester and Ms
    J A Endersby (Non Legal Member).
