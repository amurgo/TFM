For the Respondent: Mr C Bates Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

1. I have considered whether any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction. No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as they were in
   the First-tier Tribunal.

3. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Ransley promulgated on 27 October  2014  which  dismissed
   the Appellant's appeal against a decision dated 21 July 2014 to refuse a
   residence card under  Regulation  10(5)  of  the  Immigration  (European
   Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations).

Background

4. The Appellant was born on 9 January  1968  and  is  a  national  of  the
   Philippines.

5. On 19 May  2014  the  Appellant  applied  for  a  residence  card  as  a
   conformation of a retained right to  reside  in  the  UK  following  her
   divorce on 16  June  2012  from  an  EEA  national  in  accordance  with
   Regulation 10(5) of the 2006 Regulations.

6. On  21  July  2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
   application. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons:

    a) The Appellant provided no evidence that the  EEA  family  member  was
       exercising treaty rights in the UK at the time of the divorce.

    b) There were no tax records for the former EEA family  member  for  the
       period April 2011-March 2013 which supported the contention that  the
       EEA citizen was not in the UK at that time.

The Judge's Decision

7. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge  Ransley  ("the  Judge")  dismissed   the   appeal   against   the
   Respondent's decision. The Judge found:

    a) That she did not have the power to declare Regulation  10(5)  of  the
       2006 Regulations as being incompatible  with  the  Directive  Article
       13(2) and therefore she had to consider the appeal on the basis  that
       Regulation 10(5) of the 2006 Regulations was still good law.

    b) The Appellant married her husband a Polish national on  14  September
       2005.

    c) She entered the UK as a family member  of  an  EEA  national  with  a
       Residence Card valid from 22 November 2010 until 22 November 2015. In
       2007 they moved to Manchester.

    d) The Appellants husband returned to Cyprus in January 2011 when  their
       marriage broke down and did not live or work in the UK thereafter.

    e) The Appellants husband started divorce proceedings  in  May  2012  16
       months after he ceased living in the UK.

    f) As the EEA spouse had ceased to  be  a  qualified  person  16  months
       before the divorce the Appellant  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of
       Regulation 10(5)

    g) The decision was proportionate under Article 8.

8. Grounds of appeal were lodged that in essence:

    a)  They relied on NA v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ  995  where  the  Court  of
       Appeal had made a reference to the European Court of  Justice  posing
       the question as to whether the third  country  ex-spouse  of  an  EEA
       national had to show that their  EEA  spouse  was  exercising  treaty
       rights at the time of their divorce in order to  retain  a  right  of
       residence.

    b) The Judge failed to consider the argument that Article 13(2)  of  the
       Directive  was  not  therefore  properly  transposed  by   the   2006
       Regulations.

    c) The Judge failed to adopt a 'Community Law' approach.

9. On 14 July 2015 Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Saini  gave  permission  to
   appeal stating that the reference of NA was still outstanding.

10. At the hearing I heard submissions from Ms  Bremang  on  behalf  of  the
   Appellant that she relied on the grounds of appeal.

11. On behalf of the Respondent Mr Bates submitted that while the Judge  may
   have made an error in paragraph 21 in identifying the operative date  as
   the date divorce proceedings were initiated rather that referring to the
   date of termination of the marriage that mistake was not  material.  The
   EEA national was not exercising treaty rights at the time of the  decree
   absolute.

Legal Framework

12. The provision of the Regulations in issue in this case

       "Family member who has retained the right of residence"

       10.  (1)   In these Regulations, "family member who has retained the
          right of residence" means, subject to paragraph (8), a person who
          satisfies the conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

          ...

          (5)    A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if -

             (a) he ceased to be a family member of a qualified person or
             of an EEA national with a permanent right of residence on the
             termination of the marriage or civil partnership of that
             person;

             (b) he was residing in the United Kingdom in accordance with
             these Regulations at the date of the termination;

             (c) he satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and

             (d) either-

                 (i)   prior to the initiation of the proceedings for the
                 termination of the marriage or the civil partnership the
                 marriage or civil partnership had lasted for at least three
                 years and the parties to the marriage or civil partnership
                 had resided in the United Kingdom for at least one year
                 during its duration;"

Finding on Material Error

13. Having heard those  submissions,  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made no material errors of law.

14. The Judge was entitled to state that it was not  open  to  her  to  find
   that Regulation10(5) was incompatible with Directive 13(2) and stay  the
   proceedings noting as she did that the Court of Appeal had power to make
   such a declaration but had chosen  not  to  do  so.  She  was  therefore
   entitled to proceed on the basis  that  Regulation  10(5)  of  the  2006
   Regulations was good law.

15. The Judge found as a fact in this case that  the  EEA  spouse  commenced
   divorce proceedings in May 2012 and had noted in paragraph 8 that  there
   was a decree absolute dated 16 June 2012.  The  former  EEA  spouse  was
   therefore not a qualified person at the time of the divorce.

16. The Judgement of the European Court NA  [2016]  EUECJ  C-115/15(30  June
   2016) confirmed that Regulation 10(5)  was  indeed  consistent  with  EU
   Directive 13(2) and the Judges interpretation of the law  in  this  case
   was correct:

   "On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:

    1. Article 13(2)(c) of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European  Parliament
       and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of  the
       Union and their family members to move and reside freely  within  the
       territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC)  No 1612/68
       and  repealing   Directives   64/221/EEC,   68/360/EEC,   72/194/EEC,
       73/148/EEC,  75/34/EEC,   75/35/EEC,   90/364/EEC,   90/365/EEC   and
       93/96/EEC, must  be  interpreted  as  meaning  that  a  third-country
       national, who is divorced from a Union citizen at whose hands she has
       been the victim of domestic violence during the marriage, cannot rely
       on the retention of her right of residence in the host Member  State,
       on the basis of that provision, where  the  commencement  of  divorce
       proceedings post-dates the departure of the Union citizen spouse from
       the Member State."

17. Ms Bremang quite properly accepted that NA did not assist her case.  The
   Appellants  circumstances  as  found  by  Judge  Ransley,  that  divorce
   proceedings post-dated the departure of the Appellants husband from  the
   UK, clearly entitled the Judge to find that the Appellant could not meet
   the requirements of Regulation 10(5) which the European Court implicitly
   accept properly transposed the Directives on this issue.

CONCLUSION

18. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established  and  that
   the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

19. The appeal is dismissed.
