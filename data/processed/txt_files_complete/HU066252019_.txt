                            DECISION AND REASONS

This has been a remote hearing to which there has been no objection  by  the
parties. The form of remote hearing  was  Microsoft  Teams.  A  face-to-face
hearing was not held because it was not practicable, and  all  issues  could
be determined in a remote hearing.

The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 6 May 1989.  On  23  October
2018 she made a human rights claim in an  application  for  entry  clearance
under Appendix FM of the immigration rules on the basis of her  family  life
with her husband, Muhammad Haroon  Qureshi.  Her  claim  was  refused  in  a
decision dated 27 March 2019 on the grounds that  she  could  not  meet  the
financial eligibility requirements of Section  E-ECP  of  Appendix  FM.  The
documents submitted in regard to the sponsor's employment did not  meet  the
requirements of Appendix FM-SE and the respondent could  not  be  satisfied,
from the documents submitted, as to the sponsor's  salary  from  employment.
The  respondent  considered  further  that   there   were   no   exceptional
circumstances justifying a grant of entry clearance  on  Article  8  grounds
outside the immigration rules.

The appellant appealed that decision and the appeal came  before  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Welsh on 18 November 2019.  The  judge  considered  that  the
documents submitted in relation to the sponsor's  employment  did  not  meet
the requirements of Appendix FM-SE and, further, that  the  quality  of  the
evidence submitted was not such that she ought to find  that  the  financial
threshold required by the immigration rules was met.  The  judge  considered
Article 8 outside the immigration rules and accepted that the appellant  and
sponsor were married and had a child who was British  and  was  living  with
the appellant in Pakistan such that Article  8  was  engaged.  However,  the
judge found that  the  public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of  effective
immigration control outweighed the interference with the appellant's  family
life and that the respondent's decision  was  therefore  proportionate.  The
appeal was accordingly dismissed.

The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  that  decision  to  the  Upper
Tribunal  on  the  grounds  that  the  judge  erred  in  carrying  out   the
proportionality assessment as she failed  to  consider  the  impact  of  the
decision on the appellant's British child and that the judge's decision  was
contrary to the judgment in Zambrano [2011] All ER (EC) 491.

Permission was refused in the First-tier Tribunal but  was  granted  by  the
Upper Tribunal on 1 June 2020 on a renewed application, on the grounds  that
the judge arguably failed to consider whether refusing the  appellant  entry
clearance would have the effect of denying her British  national  child  the
genuine enjoyment of his rights as an EU  citizen,  with  reference  to  the
case of MA and SM (Zambrano:  EU  children  outside  EU)  Iran  [2013]  UKUT
00380.

Further to directions made by the Upper Tribunal on 30  November  2020,  the
respondent made written submissions conceding that the  First-tier  Tribunal
had materially erred by failing to have regard to the best interests of  the
child, by failing to give consideration to the child's  British  citizenship
and by failing to consider why family life could not continue with  all  the
family residing together in  Pakistan.  The  respondent  invited  the  Upper
Tribunal to set aside the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  on  the
limited basis that the wider proportionality assessment was flawed,  but  to
preserve the primary findings of fact made by the FTT.

At a hearing on 18 March 2021, I set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal in accordance with the respondent's concession. It  was  agreed  by
all parties that the re-making of  the  decision  should  take  place  at  a
resumed hearing on another day owing to the fact that the sponsor wanted  to
submit further documentary evidence to show that he was  able  to  meet  the
financial requirements of the immigration rules.

The matter then  came  before  me  for  the  decision  to  be  re-made.  The
appellant had produced a further  bundle  showing  the  sponsor's  financial
circumstances and Mr Walker advised  me  that  he  was  satisfied  that  the
sponsor's current combined  salary  was  over  ï¿½20,000  per  annum.  He  was
satisfied that the financial requirements of Appendix FM of the  immigration
rules were now met and that, for the purposes of Article  8,  there  was  no
public interest in the appellant being denied entry clearance.  He  conceded
that the appeal should accordingly be allowed under Article 8.

In light of Mr Walker's concession, there is no need for me to set  out  any
detailed reasoning, save to state that the decision to refuse the  appellant
entry clearance is disproportionate in light of the fact  that  she  is  now
able to meet the immigration rules in all  respects.  Accordingly,  I  allow
the appellant's appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds.

DECISION

The original Tribunal was found to  have  made  an  error  of  law  and  the
decision was set aside. I re-make the decision by allowing  the  appellant's
appeal.
