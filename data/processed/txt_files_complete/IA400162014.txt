Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr R Pennington-Benton, counsel instructed by
                    Lincoln's Chambers solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                             DECISION & REASONS

1.    The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on 1 January 1982.  He
arrived in the United Kingdom  on  19  January  2008  with  entry  clearance
conferring leave to enter until 30 April 2010 as a student. This  leave  was
subsequently extended as a Tier 4 student until 31 May 2012.  The  Appellant
made an in-time application  to  further  extend  his  leave  and  this  was
refused on 9 January 2013 but on appeal the First-tier Tribunal allowed  his
appeal in  a  decision  dated  17  May  2013.  The  Respondent  then  sought
permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  which  was  granted  and  on  27
November 2013 the Respondent's appeal  was  allowed.  The  Appellant  sought
permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal which  application  was  refused
by the Upper Tribunal on 2 January 2014. On 18 January 2014,  the  Appellant
made a further Tier 4  application.  This  application  was  refused  on  19
September 2014 and in identical terms on 22 September 2014, at which time  a
decision was also made to remove the Appellant from the  United  Kingdom  by
way of directions under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum &  Nationality
Act 2006. A right of appeal was provided pursuant to section  82(1)  of  the
NIAA 2002 and the Appellant sought to appeal this decision.

2.    His appeal came before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Bowes  for
hearing on 27 January 2014. In a decision promulgated on 10  February  2015,
the Judge requested that the parties address him on  whether  the  Appellant
had a full right of appeal and having heard submissions he held that he  had
no jurisdiction to hear the appeal in light of  the  provisions  of  section
3C(4) of the Immigration Act 1971 because whilst the  Appellant  had  extant
leave under section 3C when he made the Tier 4  application  on  18  January
2014, he was not permitted to apply to vary it  [18].  He  further  held  at
[19] that in light of the decision in Virk v  Secretary  of  State  for  the
Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 652 that statutory  jurisdiction  cannot  be
conferred by waiver or agreement and the Respondent did not have  discretion
to disregard section  3C(4)  and  the  application  that  was  made  by  the
Appellant in January 2014 was not valid.

3.    An application for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was
made in-time on 19 February 2015. The grounds in support of the  application
asserted  that  the  appeal  raises  a  short   but   important   point   of
construction, namely whether section  3C(4)  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971
prevents the Respondent from considering an application for leave to  remain
made while  the  applicant  is  on  3C  leave  and  the  Respondent  retains
discretion to consider an application for leave and to waive  reliance  upon
section 3C(4). It was submitted that the First Tier Tribunal Judge erred  in
finding the appeal to be a nullity.

4.    In a decision dated 15 June 2015, permission to appeal was granted  by
First-tier Tribunal Judge Astle on the basis that the Respondent's  decision
was made under section 47 of the 2006 Act which generates a right of  appeal
under section 82(2)(ha) of the NIAA 2002 and as such  it  is  arguable  that
the Judge erred in refusing to accept jurisdiction.

5.    The Respondent's rule 24 response states:

    "The judge of the FTT did not misdirect himself in law  in  respect  of
    the immigration decision before him. The appellant's first appeal  that
    was dismissed by the Upper Tribunal and permission to appeal refused by
    the Court of Appeal on the 2nd January 2014 was finally  determined  on
    that date for the purposes of s.104 NIA 2002. The first appeal was  not
    longer pending for the purposes of S.3C(2)(c)  of  the  same  Act.  The
    appellant made no further application to appeal after that date to  the
    Court of Appeal. Accordingly the  appellant's  second  application  was
    made out of time, without any leave, substantive or under  section  3C.
    The resultant immigration decision was therefore not a refusal to  vary
    leave but just a refusal to grant leave to remain. It  was  a  decision
    that did not fall under section 82 NIA 2002 the judge  was  correct  in
    not accepting jurisdiction in respect of the immigration decision."



Hearing

6.    At the hearing before me, Mr Pennington-Benton made concerted  efforts
to persuade me that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had jurisdiction  because,
notwithstanding the Appellant  having  made  his  application  during  leave
extended by section 3C, the Secretary of State treated  the  application  as
having been validly made. He submitted, in line with the grounds  of  appeal
and supplementary argument on behalf of the Appellant that:

    (i)    there is unarguably scope for the Secretary of  State  to  grant
    leave to remain outside the Rules cf. Munir at [44] under  the  general
    residual power contained in section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971;

    (ii)   it would be wrong to construe section 3C(4) as a fetter  on  the
    Secretary of State's power to consider  and  respond  as  a  matter  of
    substance to an application for leave that would otherwise be  formally
    invalid;

    (iii)  the Secretary of State's broad powers in  section  3  trump  the
    procedural protections of section 3C(4) and Parliament did not  intend,
    by providing the protections in section 3C(4)  to  lessen  the  general
    powers in section 3C;

    (iv)   the purpose of section 3C(4) is  to  protect  the  Secretary  of
    State from being compelled to deal with multiple applications, however,
    if the Secretary of State decides to waive the  invalidity  and  decide
    the application that is a matter for her cf. Kammins Ballrooms Co Ltd v
    Zenith Investments (Torquay) Ltd [1971] AC 850;

    (v)    in respect of the decision in R (Bhagat) v  SSHD  [2014]  1  WLR
    3710, Claire Moulder, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge held at [38]
    that: "the Secretary of State was bound by the statutory provisions and
    had no discretion to  treat  the  application  as  valid"  but  it  was
    submitted that her conclusion was per incuriam and on the facts of that
    case the Secretary of State  had  decision  to  refuse  to  decide  the
    application.

7.    In response, Ms Fijiwala submitted that:

    (i)     the  decision  made  by  the  Judge  is  correct:  he  had   no
    jurisdiction and no discretion in relation to section 3C(4).

    (ii)   the right of appeal  had  been  given  to  the  Appellant  on  a
    mistaken basis;

    (iii)  in respect of the decision pursuant to section 47, the Appellant
    would have the right of appeal in  relation  to  the  removal  but  not
    against the decision because the decision was not valid;

    (iv)   in light of the decision on JH (Zimbabwe) [2009] EWCA Civ 78  at
    [35] it is clear that during a period  of  statutory  extension  of  an
    applicant's original leave by section 3C4 no  further  application  for
    variation of that leave can be made. It is clear that the Appellant had
    extant leave after his appeal was dismissed by the Upper  Tribunal  and
    he made his application during this period but it is also clear he  was
    not able to vary his application. This is because it is clear  from  JH
    (Zimbabwe) at [36] that  a  variation  can  only  be  made  before  the
    Secretary of State's decision: see section 3C5 and on  that  basis  the
    application should not have been accepted

    (v)    in respect of the question of a waiver, she submitted that there
    could be no waiver in relation to  statute  and  the  discretion  under
    section 3 of 1971 Act only applies to Rules or policy. Alvi [2012] UKSC
    33 at [28] makes clear that any power that the Secretary of State would
    have would be suspended by an Act of Parliament and at [31] that it was
    clear that in relation to the exercise of residual discretion where  an
    alien does not meet the requirements of the Rules this does  not  refer
    to the waiver of a statute and statutory  context  must  be  respected.
    Even the Immigration Rules have to be laid before  Parliament  and  are
    subject to scrutiny and cannot override  statute.  She  submitted  that
    Munir [2012] UKSC 32 at [29] made the  same  point  as  Alvi  that  the
    Immigration Act 1971 gives Parliament a degree of control and it  makes
    no sense if the Secretary of State could override an Act of Parliament.
    She submitted that Odelola [2009] UKHL 25 at [34] makes clear that  the
    Rules are executive and not legislative and at [35] that the Rules  are
    statements of administrative policy. The Supreme Court has  made  clear
    that the exercise of  discretion  is  in  relation  to  Rules  and  not
    statute: [46] and [50] refer.

    (vi)   Munir can be distinguished as it refers  to  discretion  outside
    the Rules viz the policy DP5/96 rather than statute  and  it  is  clear
    from [44] of Munir that even if the discretion is  wide  it  cannot  be
    applied to statute. She referred by way of analogy to  the  deportation
    rules and submitted that, if there  was  discretion  in  terms  of  the
    statute, the Secretary of State could waive automatic deportation.

    (vii)  in respect of the judgment in Bhagat at [33]-[34] and  [37]  the
    submission on behalf of the Secretary of  State  is  that  there  is  a
    statutory bar to discretion being exercised albeit it was accepted that
    there is a general discretion to grant leave. It  is  clear  from  [38]
    that the Secretary of State is bound by statutory provision  and  there
    is no discretion to treat the application as valid.  In  R  (Rashid)  v
    Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2015]  00190  the  Court
    considered itself bound by JH (Zimbabwe) at [28]  and  following  those
    findings the Appellant was unable to  make  an  application  and  there
    could be no waiver.

8.    Mr Pennington-Benton responded and  also  drew  my  attention  to  the
judgment of the Court of Appeal in R (Iqbal) v Secretary of  State  for  the
Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 838.

Decision

9.    I consider the First-tier Tribunal Judge Bowes did not materially  err
in law in holding that he had no jurisdiction to hear the purported  appeal.
My reasons are as follows:

    9.1.   it is well-established by the jurisprudence that  section  3C(4)
    of the  Immigration  Act  1971  operates  so  that,  once  a  statutory
    extension of the original leave has been made pursuant to  section  3C,
    no further application for variation of that leave can be made  because
    "once a decision has been made, no  variation  to  the  application  is
    possible since there is nothing left to  vary":  JH  (Zimbabwe)  [2009]
    EWCA Civ 78 per Lord Justice Richards at [35]. See also the decision of
    Upper Tribunal Judge Gill in R (Rashid) v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department IJR [2015] UKUT 00190 (IAC) at [21]-[33]and [46].

    9.2.   the Appellant in this case made an in-time application to extend
    his leave on 31 May 2012 and whilst this application was refused  on  9
    January 2013, section 3C extended his leave through the appeal  process
    until permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal was  refused  by  the
    Upper Tribunal on 2 January 2014. Even if, by virtue of rule 52.4(b) of
    the CPR the Appellant's leave was deemed extended  by  21  days  to  23
    January  2014,  during  which  time  he  could  have  made  an  in-time
    application for permission to appeal to the Court of  Appeal  directly,
    this does not avail him because section 3C(4) prevented him from making
    a further application to vary his leave.

    9.3.   Consequently, whilst I consider that the application made by the
    Appellant on 17 January 2014 for further leave to remain as  a  Tier  4
    student was a valid application, it did not entitle him to the right of
    appeal when it was refused on 19 or 22 September 2014. This is  because
    it could only be treated as a fresh application and not an  application
    to vary his leave to remain. The fact  that  there  are  two  identical
    decisions with slightly varying dates matters not as  the  contents  of
    the decision letter are the same.

    9.4.   I note that the grant of permission provides that the  Appellant
    had a valid right of appeal  pursuant  to  section  82((2)(ha)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration & Asylum Act  2002  against  the  decision  to
    remove him by way of directions under section 47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum & Nationality Act 2006, however, this  would  only  apply  to  a
    person with statutorily extended leave and for the reasons set  out  in
    9.1. above, he no longer had statutorily extended leave at the time  of
    the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  of  19  or  22  September  2014.
    Consequently, the grant of permission was misconceived.

    9.5.   I further find that it was not open to the Respondent  to  waive
    the statutory provisions of section 3C(4)  and  provide  the  Appellant
    with the right of appeal where no right of appeal existed as  a  matter
    of law. As the Court of Appeal held in Virk v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 652 per Patten LJ at 23: "Statutory
    jurisdiction cannot be conferred by waiver or agreement..." I accept Ms
    Fijiwala's submission that  the  right  of  appeal  was  given  to  the
    Appellant on a mistaken basis.

10.   Therefore, I find no material error of law  in  the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal Bowes that he had no jurisdiction  to  hear  the  appeal
because  there  was  no  valid  appeal  before  him   and   that   statutory
jurisdiction cannot be conferred by  waiver  or  agreement.  Consequently  I
dismiss the appeal.
