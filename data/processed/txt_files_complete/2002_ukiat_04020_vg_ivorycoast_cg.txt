                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Representation

For The Appellant:           Ms R Giltrow, Home Office Presenting Officer
For The Respondent:    Ms J Rothwell, of  Counsel,  instructed  by  Roelens,
    Solicitors


1.    The Appellant,  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department,
    appeals with leave of the Tribunal  against  the  Determination  of  an
    Adjudicator (Mr D J B Trotter) allowing  the  Respondent's  asylum  and
    human rights appeals against the decision of the Appellant made on  4th
    September 2000 to give directions  for  her  removal  from  the  United
    Kingdom following refusal of her asylum application.

2.    The Respondent in this case arrived in the  United  Kingdom  with  her
    husband who has made his own claim for  asylum.   His  application  was
    refused and, according to  Counsel,  is  due  to  be  heard  before  an
    Adjudicator in Southshields on 26th June 2002.  The Appellant  and  her
    husband now have a daughter, born on 5th March 2001.

3.    The Respondent's claim for asylum is that just before  Christmas  1999
    a military coup took place in the Ivory Coast which overthrew the  PDCI
    government.  Her husband's family were members of the PDCI, her mother-
    in-law was a local secretary and she lived with that family.   On  26th
    December 1999, their home was visited by members of the  military,  who
    beat them up with clubs and rubber batons.  They also made  them  drink
    toilet water.  The soldiers raped her, and at this point she  began  to
    cry.  She had never told her husband before the hearing about this  for
    fear of ruining their  marriage.   The  Adjudicator  noticed  that  her
    husband began to cry and buried his head in his  hands.   Following  on
    from that rape, she suffered a miscarriage.  After the miscarriage, she
    managed to get disguised with the assistance of her mother to whom  she
    had turned for help after the abduction of her mother-in-law and father-
    in-law.  In disguise, she was able to get away in a car, make  her  way
    to a village with her husband where they were given shelter by a pastor
    and attended the church service.  Her husband was himself a pastor.  On
    9th January 2000, the soldiers  burst  into  the  church  seeking  PDCI
    members, beating members of the congregation at will but not, thanks to
    the silence  of  the  congregation,  finding  the  Respondent  and  her
    husband.  Thereafter, and in order to save individual churches from the
    possibility of similar  treatment,  they  were  moved  from  church  to
    church, week by week, hiding in church premises  where  possible.   She
    indicated that she had been hiding in 27 or 28 in the period after that
    until the couple got out of the Ivory Coast in the July of 2000.   They
    were smuggled out with the aid of church members.   She  did  not  know
    where her husband's parents were or what  has  happened  to  them;  she
    thought that they were dead.

4.    In allowing the appeal, the Adjudicator  stated  that  in  cases  like
    this one looks to corroboration from the objective evidence.  There  is
    certainly corroboration in the somewhat out-of-date objective  evidence
    that has been accumulated in the course of  this case that  the  period
    immediately after the coup d'ï¿½tat and during  the  military  government
    was a period of lawlessness, violence to those who were or were thought
    to be members of the opposition, the soldiery being unrestrained by law
    or common humanity.

5.    In seeking corroboration of an account, one  also  looks  to  internal
    consistency.  One particular matter of  corroboration  stood  out  very
    clearly in his hearing of this case.  He was able to see the  husband's
    reaction to his wife's account of having been raped and thereafter  not
    having told him about that  because  of  the  risk  of  spoiling  their
    marriage.  Because of the way in which the court was structured, he had
    a clear view of the husband as that evidence  was  given.   He  had  no
    doubt whatsoever that, when she told him that this  was  something  she
    had not told her  husband  before,  she  was  telling  the  Adjudicator
    nothing other than the truth.  Her husband's reaction was dramatic  and
    totally genuine.  He was prepared, therefore, to find the assertions of
    fact which the  Respondent  makes  proved,  not  merely  on  the  lower
    standard of proof which is requisite for  asylum  claims,  but  on  the
    balance of probabilities.  If he were required to do so, he  would  say
    that he was certain  beyond  reasonable  doubt  that  the  Respondent's
    evidence was true.

6.    The Adjudicator then went on to consider the objective  evidence.   He
    found that there were reports of continuing  sporadic  lawlessness  and
    violence,  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,  murders,  beatings   and
    torture.  Nevertheless, the situation  at  the  moment  was  much  more
    stable than it was when the Respondent and her husband left  the  Ivory
    Coast.

7.    The Respondent's Counsel had pointed the Adjudicator to paragraph  136
    of the UNHCR Handbook.  This deals with the situation that  applies  to
    statutory refugees whose native country has improved since the day when
    they were persecuted but who are able  "to  invoke  compelling  reasons
    arising  out  of  the  previous  persecution  for  refusing  to   avail
    themselves of the protection of the country  of  nationality"  (Article
    1C(5) of  the  1951  Convention).   The  Adjudicator  stated  that  the
    Respondent is, of course, not a statutory  refugee  but  the  paragraph
    goes on "the exception, however, reflects a more  general  humanitarian
    principle, which could also be applied to refugees other than statutory
    refugees".  He took the view that what had happened to  the  Respondent
    and her  husband  amounted  to  "atrocious  persecution"  which  is  an
    exception to the general rule.   He  therefore  had  no  hesitation  in
    finding that the Respondent was  within  that  exception  described  in
    paragraph 136 as "a more general humanitarian principle".   He  applied
    that principle and on that basis concluded that the Respondent was now,
    as she had been, a refugee within the Convention.

8.    Although he was not required to by virtue of  the  date  of  decision,
    the Adjudicator commented on the Respondent's human  rights  appeal  by
    saying that, if he were permitted to,  he  would  have  found  that  by
    reason of her past experiences it would be a breach of her rights under
    Article 3 were she to return to  Ivory  Coast  where  she  had  clearly
    suffered such atrocious treatment.  However, he said that he was  bound
    by  Kariharan  which  prevents  him   from   applying   human   rights'
    consideration to someone who is, as  this  Respondent  is,  an  illegal
    entrant.  He therefore dismissed the human rights appeal.

9.    At the hearing before the Tribunal, Counsel submitted a cross  appeal.
    He submitted that the Adjudicator had no jurisdiction  to  apply  human
    rights' consideration to the facts of this case and that Kariharan  was
    due to be heard by the Court of Appeal on 17th June 2000.

10.   We informed Counsel  that  the  decision  to  refuse  the  Appellant's
    asylum in the United Kingdom was taken on 4th  September  2000,  before
    the coming into force of the Human Rights Act.  Therefore, this was not
    a matter in which we had jurisdiction and therefore we were  not  going
    to entertain the cross appeal.

11.   The only appeal before us, therefore, is in  relation  to  the  asylum
    appeal of the Respondent  which was allowed by the Adjudicator.

12.   Ms Giltrow relied on the grounds of appeal.  She  submitted  that  the
    Adjudicator was flawed in his findings that soldiers  actively  pursued
    the  Respondent  when  she  was  in  hiding  in  the  year  2000.   The
    Respondent's evidence at the hearing was that the soldiers were seeking
    PDCI members and her name was not called out.

13.   She further submitted that the Adjudicator did not  give  reasons  why
    the Respondent would  be  persecuted  on  return,  notwithstanding  the
    unstable  situation  in  December  when  the  events   happened.    The
    Adjudicator failed to have regard to background material pertaining  to
    the situation in Ivory Coast as  at  the  time  of  the  hearing.   His
    finding that the Respondent would be at risk of persecution  on  return
    is not backed up by the objective material.  At page 6 of  the  October
    2001 CIPU report are  various  election  reports.   They  included  the
    results of the presidential election held on  22nd  October  2000,  the
    results of a by-election held on 14th January 2000 and  local  election
    results held on 25th March 2001.  According to the by-election results,
    the PDCI won 96 seats.  They won 59 communes as a result of  the  local
    election on 25th March 2001.  Ms Giltrow submitted that  there  was  no
    evidence now, even if those events had happened,  that  they  were  the
    actions of soldiery who were out of control and there was  no  evidence
    that she was persecuted in any way because of  her  political  opinion.
    Although the Adjudicator had sympathy for this claim, he has misapplied
    the principles in Ravichandran and,  on  the  objective  evidence,  the
    Respondent cannot show that she will be at risk were she to  return  to
    Ivory Coast now.

14.   In reply, Counsel submitted that the soldiery who committed  the  acts
    of persecution against the Respondent were agents of  the  state.   She
    referred us to paragraphs 3.13 and 3.14 of the CIPU report in which  it
    was said that General Guei said on 10th July that  those  soldiers  who
    had participated in the mutiny would be  punished.   Counsel  submitted
    that this evidence shows that action is  only  taken  against  soldiers
    when they have gone against General Guei.  Other background material in
    the Respondent's  evidence,  in  particular  the  US  State  Department
    report, states that the new Constitution granted immunity to  all  CNSP
    members and all participants in the December 1999 coup d'ï¿½tat for  acts
    committed in connection with the coup, which  implicitly  included  all
    criminal activity.  Counsel submitted in the  light  of  this  evidence
    that those who  committed  the  rape  against  the  Respondent  can  be
    classified as state agents.

15.   Counsel accepted that the Adjudicator made no finding of  fact  as  to
    whether the visit of the soldiers to the church during the  service  on
    9th January 2000 was to specifically  seek  out  the  Respondent.   She
    submitted that it is incumbent on an Adjudicator to make such  findings
    of fact.  This is a central issue in this case.  However,  recorded  in
    the Determination at paragraph 13 is  the  Respondent's  evidence  that
    soldiers  had  gone  to  church  looking  for  her  and   her   husband
    specifically but the Adjudicator failed to make a finding on this.  She
    would therefore ask that we remit the appeal for this  reason  so  that
    the Respondent's appeal can be heard with her husband's appeal on  26th
    June 2002.

16.   The Tribunal agrees that the Adjudicator failed to make a  finding  of
    fact on an issue central to the claim.   The  Respondent  claimed  that
    they had fled from the village where they had been given shelter  by  a
    pastor because on 9th January 2000 the soldiers burst into  the  church
    seeking PDCI members, beating members of the congregation at  will  but
    not, thanks to the silence of the congregation, finding  the  Appellant
    and her husband.  Although this is an issue central to their claim,  as
    it was on the basis of this that they left Ivory Coast, we do not  feel
    it appropriate to remit the appeal simply so that a finding can be made
    on this matter.  Events in Ivory Coast have moved on since the coup  in
    December 1999, of which this central issue was a  part.   We  therefore
    propose to deal with the matter ourselves.

17.   The Adjudicator made no clear finding as to whether the  soldiers  who
    burst into the church on 9th January 2000 had done so  specifically  to
    seek out the Respondent  and  her  husband.   We  have  looked  at  the
    Respondent's statement wherein she says that owing to the influence  of
    her mother-in-law, she joined the PDCI and had an active  role  in  the
    party.  She and her  husband  attended  the  meetings  and  distributed
    leaflets.  Further on in her statement, she said that when the soldiers
    entered the church on 9th January 2000 they said that  they  knew  that
    the pastor of the church was harbouring someone.   They  threatened  to
    smash up the church if their identities were not revealed.   Nobody had
    informed them of their identity.  In the light of the evidence,  before
    us, we are prepared to accept that  the  soldiers  had  gone  into  the
    church on 9th January 2000 specifically to look for the Respondent  and
    her husband because of their political activities for the  PDCI;  that,
    in the light of her previous experience of being raped by the soldiers,
    she had a well-founded fear that they would do the same to her, had she
    been found  that day.  Therefore, on the evidence before us, we  accept
    that when she fled Ivory Coast, about July 2000,she had a  well-founded
    fear of persecution by reason of her political opinion.

18.   It is obvious to us that the Adjudicator was so moved by sympathy  for
    the Respondent and by her husband's reaction to her  evidence  of  rape
    that he invoked the proviso in Article 1C(5) of the 1951 Convention  to
    allow the appeal.  The Adjudicator erred in doing so.

19.   Article 1C of the 1951 Convention provides that:

      This convention shall cease to apply to any person falling  under  the
    terms of Section A if :

    5) He can no longer, because the circumstances in connection with which
       he been recognised as a refugee have ceased to  exist,  continue  to
       refuse to avail himself of the protection  of  the  country  of  his
       nationality;

       Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to  a  refugee  falling
       under Section A(1) of this Article who is able to invoke  compelling
       reasons arising out of previous persecution for  refusing  to  avail
       himself of the persecution of the country of nationality;


20. It is clear that Article 1C(5) can only be invoked if that  person  has
    been recognised as a refugee.  This Respondent has never  at  any  time
    been recognised as a refugee.  Therefore, the Adjudicator's reliance on
    Article 1C(5) and its proviso was totally  misconceived.   The  correct
    approach was for the Adjudicator to look at the situation in the  Ivory
    Coast as at the  date  of  hearing  and  decide  whether  there  was  a
    reasonable degree of likelihood that the rape of the Appellant, however
    atrocious, it was, would occur again on her return and, if so,  whether
    the authorities would  be  able  and  willing  to  offer  her  adequate
    protection.


21.   The soldiers, who perpetrated the act of  rape  against  her,  are  no
    longer  in  power.   The  rape  occurred  at  a  time  of   lawlessness
    immediately following the coup.  We do not  accept  the  argument  that
    they are agents of persecution simply because they  have  been  granted
    immunity from their act of criminality.  We do not believe that in  the
    current prevailing circumstances, the respondent is likely to be  raped
    again by soldiers but if in the unlikely event that  she  is,  we  find
    that on the objective material  before  us,  the  authorities  will  be
    willing and able to offer her adequate protection to the Horvath test.

22.   However, the Respondent's fear of persecution is not well founded  now
    as events in Ivory Coast have moved on since the coup in December 1996.
     It is clear from the CIPU report of October 2001 that Ivory  Coast  is
    now a multi-party democracy; Presidential,  legislative  and  municipal
    elections were held in October 2000, December 2000 and March 2001.  The
    PDCI, of which the  Appellant  was  a  member,  participated  in  those
    elections.  They won 77 seats in the legislative election held on  10th
    December 2000 and 19 seats in the by-elections  held  on  14th  January
    2000, totalling 96 seats.  In the local election held on 25 March 2001,
    they won 59 communes.  In the light of such evidence, the Adjudicator's
    finding that the Respondent would be at  risk  on  her  return  is  not
    backed up by the  objective material.


23.   Accordingly, Appellant's the appeal is allowed.
