Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Clarke, Counsel, instructed by Fadiga & Co
For the Respondent:    Miss E Martin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Thailand born on  9  October  1971.   She
    arrived in this country on 17 March 1995 on a  spouse  visa.   She  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain on 25  April  1996.   She  had  four
    children with her husband.  They range in age from 16 to  6.   She  and
    her husband are now separated and the appellant is  in  a  relationship
    with a Slovakian national.  They had started living together at the end
    of September 2009.

2.   On 7 November 2011 the appellant  was  convicted  of  committing  arson
    recklessly and on 19 December 2011 she was sentenced to  one  year  and
    six months' imprisonment.  The appellant has  no  previous  convictions
    although on 6 June 2005 she was cautioned for common assault.

3.   In the light of the  appellant's  conviction  the  Secretary  of  State
    decided to deport her under Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 as
    the appellant had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for at least
    twelve months.

4.   The appellant appealed against the decision and her appeal came  before
    a panel on 11 June 2013.  The appellant was represented then as she  is
    now by Mr Clarke.

5.   The panel heard evidence from the appellant and  her  partner  and  her
    landlord and a friend.

6.   It was accepted before the panel that although the appellant's  partner
    was an EEA national there was no appeal under the EEA  Regulations  and
    under the Immigration Rules, paragraph 399B, the  appellant  could  not
    succeed because although the appellant was in  a  genuine  relationship
    with  her  partner,  it  was  not  accepted   that   there   would   be
    insurmountable obstacles to family life with  that  partner  continuing
    outside the UK.

7.   The panel then went on to  consider  Article  8  in  the  light  of  MF
    (Nigeria) [2012] UKUT 00393.

8.   The panel found that Article 8 was engaged  on  private  life  grounds.
    Article 8 was not engaged  in  respect  of  family  life  "because  the
    appellant has no contact with her ex-husband or any of her children and
    has not done so since 2010, three years ago".

9.   The panel noted that she was not living with her partner  and  had  not
    lived with him since she had been arrested for the  offence  of  arson.
    On release from prison she resided with her landlord.

10.  The panel considered that the  respondent's  decision  was  lawful  and
    necessary in a democratic society.

11.  The appellant's arson offence involved her partner.  Both she  and  her
    partner had been drinking and he had indicated an  intention  to  leave
    her and she had set fire to the sheets on his bed.

12.  In weighing up the issues the panel noted that the appellant's  partner
    had forgiven her and had visited her  in  prison  every  two  or  three
    weeks.

13.  The panel noted that the appellant had been  resident  in  the  UK  for
    seventeen years and was in a relationship with her partner but lived at
    her surety's address due to her bail conditions. Her partner  had  been
    trying to assist the appellant in finding out where her former  husband
    lived in order that they might put in a contact  application  but  they
    had not been able to identify her husband's whereabouts or that of  her
    children.

14.  The panel  noted  that  the  appellant  had  attended  an  alcohol  and
    intervention service course while  in  prison  and  had  been  a  model
    prisoner.

15.  In relation to Section 45 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration
    Act 2009 the  panel  reminded  itself  of  the  need  to  consider  the
    interests of the  appellant's  children  as  a  primary  consideration.
    However, the panel found that the appellant had not seen  her  children
    since 2010.  They were all  British  citizens  and  living  with  their
    father, also a British citizen. She had had no contact with them  since
    2010. There had been an order made in the Croydon County  Court  on  19
    August 2008 directing that she should leave her husband's  address  and
    not approach within 50 metres of it.

16.  In paragraph 18 of the determination the panel stated as follows:

         "The respondent's representative drew the appellant's attention  to
         the fact that she had been cautioned by the Metropolitan Police  on
         6 June 2005 for common assault.  In  oral  evidence  the  appellant
         told the court she said she said she remembered  the  incident  and
         she was very busy in the kitchen  and  her  son  marched  into  the
         kitchen and she pushed him away.  Her husband saw and it might have
         been her husband who reported her to the police who  arrested  her.
         She was accused of banging her child's head against  the  wall  and
         she explained to the police that she did  not  do  this.  She  only
         pushed him away and she was released.  The police had asked her all
         sorts of questions but  let  her  go  home.   She  was  not  really
         violent.  Her husband made people believe she  was.   However,  the
         facts of the matter are that she  accepted  a  caution  for  common
         assault, that she has not had any contact, direct or indirect  with
         her children since 2010, and a court order required her  to  vacate
         and not approach the home of her husband and children.   There  are
         no contact applications being made, or any indication, that without
         knowledge of her  children's  whereabouts,  or  which  school  they
         attend, it would be possible  to  launch  such  proceedings.  Under
         these circumstances there is no evidence that it would be  inimical
         to her  children's  best  interests  for  her  to  be  deported  to
         Thailand."


17.  The panel then considered the sentencing remarks made  on  18  December
    2012.  The judge stated:

         "...  you have pleaded guilty to a single count  of  causing  arson
         with intent with reckless as to whether  life  was  endangered,  an
         offence which approaches the very top of the criminal calendar.  At
         the time you were 40, you were in a relationship, you had both been
         drinking and he had indicated at that stage an intention  to  leave
         you.  Your reaction when he was asleep in bed was to  set  fire  to
         the bedding that covered him.  I accept that he woke, the fire  was
         put out almost immediately and any injury he actually suffered  was
         very minor indeed.  However, given the fact you were both drunk and
         he was asleep the potential for this in fact to have turned out  to
         be catastrophic are obvious to everyone.


         Sadly, arson in such circumstances is all too common.  I accept and
         sentence you as a woman of good  character.   You  pleaded  at  the
         first opportunity available to you on  this  count  and  cooperated
         fully with the police, indeed you made the 999 call.


         Well, offences of this sort inevitably  attract  prison  and  often
         prison of some length.  Given your good character  and  cooperation
         the least sentence I can pass is one of eighteen months.  You  will
         serve half of that sentence before you are eligible for release  on
         licence, subject to the decisions of others as to  your  status  in
         this country.


         I give you full credit for the 178 days you  have  served  or  such
         other  amount  as  is  found  to  be  accurate,   to   be   altered
         administratively."

18.  The panel observed:

         "It is very apparent to us that the appellant committed while drunk
         an extremely serious offence of arson which  could,  as  the  judge
         stated have been catastrophic as her partner was asleep in the  bed
         when she set fire to the sheets."

19.  The panel found that the appellant had spent her  childhood  and  early
    life in Thailand and had  returned  there  on  two  occasions,  on  one
    occasion for several weeks.  She had worked in a Thai restaurant  as  a
    chef and the panel did not believe she had lost contact  with  Thailand
    and she had acquired skills that would be of use to her on return.  She
    also had family in Thailand - her  mother,  stepfather  and  a  younger
    brother and sister were still living there.

20.  The panel found that the  appellant  and  her  partner  did  not  enjoy
    family life together but did have a private life  together.   While  he
    might have forgiven her that did not alter the fact that  she  had  set
    fire to his bedclothes after an argument  while  he  was  asleep.   The
    appellant told the panel that she had not given up  alcohol  completely
    and drank a glass or half a glass socially.  The relationship with  her
    partner was not of itself sufficient to render the decision  to  deport
    the appellant disproportionate.

21.  In paragraph 22 of the determination the panel concluded as follows:

         "We find that any interference with the  appellant's  private  life
         would be proportionate to the need for immigration control based on
         the seriousness of the offence, the fact  that  she  has  not  lost
         contact with her country of origin, its  language  and  indeed,  it
         would appear from her job, its cuisine.  She has visited her family
         during her sojourn in the UK.  She does not  enjoy  a  family  life
         with her current partner or her children and has  no  contact  with
         them.  We also bear in mind the case of Richards  [2013]  EWCA  Civ
         244 in which Lord Justice Laws stated, at paragraph 21,


             "What in my judgment needs emphasis is that the strong  public
             interest in deporting foreign criminals is now not merely  the
             policy  of  the  Secretary  of  State  but  the  judgment   of
             Parliament.  That gives it special weight,  which  the  courts
             ought to recognise, as no doubt  the  Strasbourg  Court  will.
             This approach  sits  with  the  well-established  approach  to
             proportionality questions in European Union law were  acts  of
             the primary legislator enjoy a wider margin of discretion ..."


         The Court of Appeal also quoted from  Gurung  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  62
         which stated, "The Borders Act by s.32 decides that the nature  and
         seriousness of the offence, as measured  by  the  sentence,  do  by
         themselves justify deportation unless an  exception  recognised  by
         the Act itself applies."  We have already found that  none  of  the
         exceptions apply to this appellant. As in the case of  Richards  we
         find that there are  no  Article  8  considerations  sufficient  to
         displace Parliament's judgment.  This appeal  fails  on  Article  8
         grounds.  We make a direction for anonymity in the interests of the
         appellant's children, who have been named in this determination."

22.  The appellant applied  for  permission  to  appeal  pointing  out  that
    family life between mother and child would continue even in  the  event
    that  the  matter  ends  in  cohabitation  and  contact  ceases  absent
    exceptional circumstances.  Reliance was placed on  G�l  v  Switzerland
    [1996] 22EHRR 93.  There  were  no  exceptional  circumstances  as  the
    appellant had  taken  steps  to  restore  contact  with  her  children.
    Reference was made to MH (Morocco) [2010] UKUT 439. Even if  there  was
    no family life the attempts to establish contact would be of  relevance
    when considering the appellant's private life. The  efforts  to  resume
    contact had not been  considered in the proportionality  exercise.  The
    same mistake vitiated the panel's approach to Section  55.   The  court
    order did not  in  its  terms  prevent  the  appellant  contacting  her
    children and the order expired on 19 August 2009.  Were  the  appellant
    to be deported it would be practically  impossible  for  the  appellant
    ever to re-establish contact with the children, which  was  a  material
    consideration under Article 8.  The respondent filed  a  notice  on  25
    July 2013 submitting that neither ground had any merit  and  the  panel
    had found there was no contact between the appellant and  her  children
    since 2010 and she did not know where the children lived.  She had  not
    been legally pursuing a contact order.

23.  At the hearing before me Counsel submitted that there was new  evidence
    about the steps to establish contact and the solicitors  instructed  in
    those proceedings had written to the appellant's husband on  20  August
    2013 proposing contact on a Saturday. Counsel referred to his  skeleton
    argument and paragraph 23 where he had referred to the  presumption  of
    family life continuing between mother and child  where  the  child  had
    been born in a genuine marriage.  The Court of Appeal in Odawey v Entry
    Clearance Officer [2011] EWCA Civ 840 had found that G�l  remained  the
    leading Strasbourg authority.  Counsel submitted  that  the  panel  had
    considered the efforts of the witnesses to re-establish  contact.   The
    appellant had only been guilty of one offence and had been sentenced to
    eighteen months' imprisonment and there was substantial mitigation. The
    appellant plainly intended to re-establish contact in the future -  see
    Ahmadi [2005]  EWCA  Civ  1721.   The  state  should  not  inhibit  the
    development of a real family life in the future "that  is  not  to  say
    that, where there has been no pre-existing family life and there exists
    only a future intention, that will be sufficient to engage  Article  8.
    There is a  world  of  difference   between  interfering  with  a  long
    established  family  life  and  merely  preventing  or  inhibiting   an
    opportunity in the future to develop such a family  relationship."  per
    Moses J.  This was a case where one brother had declared  an  intention
    to support his other brother.

24.  Although the appellant had a son in Thailand,  he  was  now  an  adult.
    The appellant had left him when he was 3 years old. At paragraph 40  of
    MH (Morocco) the Tribunal had noted that the Immigration Judge had made
    no reference to the appellant's attempts to establish contact with  his
    children when considering the appellant's private are life and  such  a
    factor was fundamental to  the  consideration  of  private  life.   The
    approach where there were contact proceedings was set out in RS (India)
    [2012] UKUT 00218 (IAC).  New  solicitors  had  been  engaged  and  the
    appellant's  husband  had  been  located.  This  was  plainly  relevant
    evidence and the appeal should be allowed or  adjourned  to  await  the
    outcome of the contact proceedings.

25.  Miss Martin distinguished the case of G�l  and  noted  that  there  had
    been no contact whatsoever between the appellant and her children since
    2010.  The relationship had ceased in these exceptional  circumstances.
     The panel had made clear findings that there was no family life and no
    contact.  In the case of G�l there was still contact.  Efforts had been
    made at the eleventh  hour  and  indeed  after  the  eleventh  hour  to
    initiate contact proceedings.  The appellant  had  been  released  from
    prison on 19 December 2011 and the First-tier hearing had been in  June
    2013 and attempts had been made with a private investigator after  that
    date.  Of course the First-tier Tribunal  could  not  be  in  error  in
    failing to consider evidence that had not arisen until after  the  date
    of the determination.  This was an eleventh hour attempt  to  frustrate
    removal. The panel had told her exactly what she had needed  to  do  in
    effect - the panel  had  noted  there  were  no  concrete  attempts  to
    establish contact.

26.   The  panel  had  heard  oral  evidence  and  there  was   no   precise
    identification of the attempts to establish  contact  between  December
    2011 and June 2013.  Since 2010 there had been  no contact. Exceptional
    circumstances had been made out and there was no family life.

27.  The appellant had a child in Thailand  and  other  family  members  and
    there was no reason why family life in the UK should trump family  life
    in Thailand.  When considering all interests in the balance  the  panel
    had been entitled to conclude as it had done.  The appellant's criminal
    offence had been very serious.  Both sides had been  drinking  and  her
    partner had been asleep  and  the  consequences  had  been  potentially
    catastrophic.  The appellant's Article 8 interests were  outweighed  in
    the circumstances.  The appellant was living with her landlord and  not
    her partner.  The further evidence had not been  considered  previously
    and indeed she had not seen it prior to the  hearing  and  it  was  not
    clear whether it had been copied to the Home Office.    The  panel  had
    considered the best interests of the  children  who  were  living  with
    their father.  The panel was aware that the court order had expired and
    had not misdirected itself.  There had been no  face  to  face  contact
    since the expiry of the court order.

28.  In reply Counsel submitted that face  to  face  contact  had  continued
    albeit not after 2010.  He  was  not  arguing  that  the  new  evidence
    indicated a material error of law.  If there was a  material  error  of
    law the new evidence was relevant, however.  The  panel  had  erred  in
    finding that because there was no contact Article 8  was  not  engaged.
    The panel had accepted there had been efforts to restore contact.

29.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my  decision.   I  can,
    as Counsel acknowledges, only interfere with the decision on a point of
    law.

30.   The deportation decision arose following  the  appellant's  conviction
    for arson.  Although there are mitigating factors, this is  undoubtedly
    a very serious offence.  The sentencing judge observed  that  arson  in
    such circumstances is all too common and the potential could have  been
    catastrophic as indeed the panel note in paragraph 19 of its  decision.
    There is no evidence that the panel erred in overlooking any aspect  of
    the mitigation and indeed that the  appellant's  partner  had  forgiven
    her.  By way of  background the panel also considered the  court  order
    and the caution in paragraphs 17 and 18 of  its  decision.   I  see  no
    evidence that the panel misunderstood the impact of the order  made  by
    the County Court or its length and duration.

31.  The panel found, and in  my  view  were  entitled  to  find,  that  the
    appellant had had no contact with her ex-husband or any of her children
    since 2010.  In paragraph 18 the panel noted  that  the  appellant  had
    accepted a caution for assault - the appellant said she had  been  busy
    in the kitchen and she had pushed her son away and she was  not  really
    violent.  The panel did not give disproportionate  emphasis  to  either
    the court order made in 2008 or the caution and in the absence  of  any
    contact applications I do not find that the panel misdirected itself in
    finding that there was no  evidence  that  would  be  inimical  to  the
    children's best interests for her to be deported.

32.  Counsel criticises the judge for failing to find that family  life  was
    made out on the basis that family  life  continued  absent  exceptional
    circumstances, applying G�l.

33.  It is true that the panel made no express reference to G�l  but  it  is
    implicit  in  the  determination  that  the   panel   considered   that
    exceptional circumstances were made out.   In relation to the  evidence
    about contact, the panel found there were no contact applications being
    made "or any indication, that  without  knowledge  of  her  children's'
    whereabouts, or which school they  attend,  it  would  be  possible  to
    launch such proceedings".

34.  As Miss Martin observes, the appellant had been  at  liberty  for  some
    time and she submits that it was only the Tribunal's remarks which  had
    spurred the appellant to take the action, as she  puts  it,  after  the
    eleventh hour.

35.  It was open to the panel to find in the light of  the  evidence  before
    it that family life had not been made out.

36.  In the alternative in the respondent's  reply  it  was  submitted  that
    there was no material error of law since the  result  would  inevitably
    have been the same.  On this basis the bonds between mother  and  child
    were weakened by her behaviour and the absence of contact and the other
    matters referred to by the panel.  The appellant has family including a
    son in Thailand.  The panel refer to these matters in paragraph  20  of
    the determination. The appellant is not living with her partner and  he
    was of course the victim in the arson attack.

37.  The panel did note that the arson attack was  committed  when  she  and
    her partner had  been  drinking  and  she  had  not  given  up  alcohol
    completely.

38.  Given the very serious nature of the offence, despite  the  mitigation,
    and the other factors alluded to by the panel, I do not find  that  the
    panel erred in law in finding that the respondent's  decision  was  not
    disproportionate.

39.   The  new  evidence  does  not  assist,  as  Counsel  acknowledges   in
    identifying whether the panel materially erred in law.  As I  have  not
    found that the panel materially erred in law, it is  not  necessary  to
    consider it in detail but I consider there is some  substance  in  Miss
    Martin's observation that the activity evidenced by  the  material  was
    very much after the eleventh hour.   Counsel  submits  that  the  panel
    accepted the evidence about the efforts to establish contact but it  is
    not clear that the panel was overly impressed by such  efforts  as  had
    been made - see the penultimate sentence of paragraph 18  for  example.
    Counsel says that the links that the appellant has  or  does  not  have
    with her son in Thailand do not diminish the links that  she  has  with
    her children in the United Kingdom.

40.  In paragraph 7 of the determination  where  the  panel  summarises  the
    appellant's case it is noted that the appellant left her  son  when  he
    was 3 years old and only saw him again in 2008 when he  was  16:  "they
    are like strangers".  This might be said to indicate that the appellant
    has not always been assiduous in maintaining links  with  her  children
    and may give support to Miss Martin's submission that the  last  minute
    activism may have been tactical rather than  born  out  of  concern  to
    maintain links. As I have said, I have not considered the new  evidence
    in detail though I  note  that  the  letter  from  the  representatives
    instructed in the contact proceedings  dated  7  August  2013  somewhat
    glosses over the appellant's history since  the  appellant's  departure
    from the family home in the penultimate sentence: "since that time  you
    have had some bad luck, including being in prison for some time".   The
    appellant pleaded guilty to a serious offence of arson and I cannot see
    by any stretch of imagination that this could be described as bad luck.



41.  I do not find that the new evidence indicates that the panel  erred  in
    law and indeed Counsel does not argue that it does. The panel  did  not
    materially misdirect itself and  I  find  that  this  challenge  fails.
    Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.

     Appeal dismissed
