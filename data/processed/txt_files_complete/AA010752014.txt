Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr J Holt, instructed by Blavo & Co Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Dawit Solomon, date of birth  1.6.88,  claims  to  be  a
    citizen of Eritrea.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Simpson, promulgated 26.6.14 dismissing his  appeal  against  the
    decisions of the  respondent,  dated  31.1.14  to  refuse  his  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human  rights  claims,  and  on  4.2.14  to
    remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 2.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    21.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 18.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Simpson should be set aside.

 6. The grounds assert  that  the  judge  erred  in  making  a  finding  of
    credibility in relation to the  appellant's  behaviour  in  challenging
    removal under  the  Dublin  II  Convention.  The  appellant  brought  a
    legitimate judicial review to stop removal. The  judge  was  not  in  a
    position to make a finding on this as the appellant  had  sought  legal
    advice in challenging removal. It is asserted that the judge failed  to
    give  proper  consideration  to  the  appellant's  application  to  the
    Ethiopian Embassy. It is claimed that the judge's consideration of this
    issue is fundamentally flawed. The attendance at the  embassy  and  the
    letter submitted with the written refusal is in line with ST CG  [2011]
    UKUT 00252 (IAC). The judge's findings at �13 of the decision show that
    she has not engaged with the facts of the appeal. The judge found  that
    the appellant is not Eritrean because he chose to conduct his interview
    in Amharic, was unable to give a meaningful description  of  Assab  and
    did not provide three witnesses to the appeal. At  paragraph  22.03  of
    the COIS report on Eritrea it is confirmed that Amharic,  a  legacy  of
    Ethiopian rule, is still widely spoken.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Osborne found, "it is at  least
    arguable  that  the  judge  was  arguably  wrong  to  have  taken   the
    appellant's judicial review application as a  matter  which  undermines
    his credibility. The legal system is there to be used by those who feel
    aggrieved for any reason. That is what the appellant did.

 8. "Although the determination must be read in its entirety  and  although
    all matters included in the determination should be read in their  full
    context, nonetheless the issue of the appellant's speaking  of  Ahmaric
    in relation to his nationality is a major  piece  of  evidence.  It  is
    arguable that the judge failed to take regard or sufficient  regard  to
    the background information in  the  COIS  report  which  confirms  that
    Amharic is still widely spoken in Eritrea. As these arguable errors  of
    law have been identified, all the issues  raised  in  the  grounds  are
    arguable."

 9. I find no merit in the ground of appeal  in  relation  to  �13  of  the
    decision and the  finding  that  the  appellant  is  not  Eritrean.  In
    reaching that conclusion, three particular  strands  of  evidence  were
    relied on by the judge, only one of which  related  to  the  choice  to
    conduct the asylum interview in Ahmaric. Whilst the background evidence
    confirms that Ahmaric is spoken in Eritrea, the criticism of the  judge
    ignores consideration of the decision as a whole.  It  was  not  simply
    that he chose to be interviewed in Ahmaric, but it  was  the  appellant
    who claimed that his mother tongue was Tigrinya. At Q14 he stated  that
    his main language was Tigrinyan, in which he was fluent. As  the  judge
    summarised at �10, the appellant also gave his evidence at  the  appeal
    hearing in Ahmaric, at his request. He stated that he spoke Tigrinya at
    home, which he learnt from both parents  (Q17),  but  particularly  his
    mother, and also claimed to be able to read Tigrinyan. Given  that  his
    mother died when he was 5 years of age, by which time the family was in
    Ethiopia, the judge found it not plausible that he could have learnt to
    both read and write Tigrinyan at that early age. In 2000, at age  about
    11/12 he was deported from Ethiopia back to  Eritrea  and  lived  there
    until May 2006. On the appellant's account the periods of time in  each
    country are somewhat vague. At Q23 he said he lived in Ethiopia for  10
    years, but that he left Assab at age 2, and that he  left  Ethiopia  in
    2000 and remained a further 6 years in Eritrea.

10. It was not accurate for the judge to suggest  that  he  could  only  be
    exposed to Ahmaric in Ethiopia, but the general point remains valid.  I
    find that it was reasonable,  on  the  basis  of  the  appellant's  own
    account, for the judge to expect that he would have a  better  language
    facility in Tigrinyan, his native tongue and the language  of  Eritrea,
    than Ahmaric, to which he would have had rather more limited  exposure,
    primarily between starting school  until  leaving  at  age  11/12  when
    deported to Eritrea, where he lived for another 6 years or so.

11. The judge's conclusion as  to  the  appellant's  nationality  was  also
    supported by the appellant's apparent lack of familiarity with  Eritrea
    or his alleged birthplace of Assab. His answers to  questions  designed
    to test this knowledge were vague and  did  not  demonstrate  any  such
    familiarity.  Further,  the  appellant  purported  to  rely  on   three
    witnesses to verify his Eritrean nationality, but  none  of  them  were
    asked to attend the appeal hearing to give evidence in support  of  the
    appellant's case.

12. It is further relevant to the judge's credibility  assessment  that  by
    his own confession the appellant had been  untruthful  about  making  a
    previous claim for asylum in Italy  and  absconded  after  encountering
    immigration officers in August 2008. See Q142 of his  asylum  interview
    where he admitted lying in his screening interview.

13. It can thus be seen that �13 of the decision was the  distillation  and
    summary of the  judge's  conclusions  on  the  evidence  given  by  the
    appellant both in his interview and at the appeal hearing.  Whether  or
    not he was exposed to Ahmaric in Eritrea, I find that the judge's point
    remains valid: that it is not credible that a person who claims to have
    been raised by his mother speaking and writing Tigrinya  at  least  for
    the first five years of life and  thereafter  living  and/or  attending
    school in Eritrea from the age of 11/12 until adulthood  should  choose
    to be interviewed and give evidence in Ahmaric rather than Tigrinyan.

14. In the circumstances, I find no material error of law in this ground of
    appeal.

15. In relation to the complaint about �9 of the decision and  the  judge's
    observations about seeking judicial review, I find that when read as  a
    whole, it is clear that the point the judge was making was  as  to  the
    appellant's behaviour and in particular, whether he had made a full and
    frank  disclosure,  as  submitted  by  Ms  Faryl.  In   assessing   his
    credibility the judge relied on the delay in the appellant telling  the
    truth; he only admitted the asylum claim in Italy when he came to light
    that his fingerprints had been taken there. In this regard,  it  should
    also  be  noted  that  the  appellant  absconded   after   encountering
    Immigration Officers in 2008. Whilst the appellant exercised his  right
    to make a judicial review application (which in fact was  refused),  it
    was not incumbent on the judge to turn a blind eye to ignore  the  fact
    that his overall behaviour, which necessarily included  the  making  of
    the judicial review application, had the effect of delaying things such
    that the Dublin Convention could no  longer  apply  to  return  him  to
    Italy. In making these observations the judge was not  suggesting  that
    the judicial review application was unmeritorious (which it turned  out
    to be), or that he was not  entitled  to  see  such  avenues  of  legal
    redress as were open to him. In any event, even if the judge's  comment
    was improper and amounted to an error of law, I find that  it  was  not
    material to the outcome of the appeal. It does not follow that the rest
    of the decision is flawed, or that the assessment of credibility  would
    or could have reached  any  different  conclusion  in  the  absence  of
    comment about judicial review or that the  other  credibility  findings
    were somehow undermined by this comment so that the findings should  be
    set aside.

16. A further ground of appeal was abandoned at the hearing before me, when
    it was pointed out that when carefully examined, the documents at 18-19
    of the appellant's  bundle  undermined  the  appellant's  case  and  in
    particular the ground of appeal that  the  judge  had  failed  to  give
    proper consideration to the appellant's application  to  the  Ethiopian
    embassy. The documents did not assist the appellant  at  all  and  thus
    there could be no error of law in failing to mention them in the First-
    tier Tribunal decision.

Conclusion & Decision

17. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
