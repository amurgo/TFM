Representation:
Appellant   Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent  Mr Karnic, Counsel, instructed by Adamsons Law
Interpreters     Mr Asghar (respondent); Ms Losa (sponsor)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  The background to this case is
    that the appellant came to the United Kingdom in 2000 as a visitor.  He
    overstayed and subsequently married the sponsor, Dominka Gregusova,  on
    October 18, 2012.

 3. Two months later he made his first application  for  a  residence  card
    based on the fact he was married to an EEA national who was  exercising
    treaty rights.

 4. The respondent called the parties in for interviews and following those
    interviews the respondent refused the application on February 24, 2013.
    The appellant appealed that decision and the appeal came  before  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Manuel on February 20, 2014. She  found  the
    marriage was a marriage of convenience and dismissed the  appeal  in  a
    decision promulgated on April 9, 2014.

 5. The appellant submitted a fresh application for a residence card on May
    24, 2014 but the respondent again refused this application on  July  1,
    2014. The appellant appealed this refusal under section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and Regulation 26  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 6. The matter came before Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  De  Haney  on
    October 21, 2014 and in a decision promulgated on November 19, 2014 the
    Tribunal allowed the appeal and directed the appellant be issued with a
    residence card.

 7. The respondent applied for permission to appeal on  November  21,  2014
    submitting the Tribunal had erred. Permission to appeal  was  initially
    refused by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Tiffen on January 6,  2015.
    Those grounds were renewed to the Upper Tribunal and on Apri  16,  2015
    Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor found it arguable the Tribunal had erred.



 8. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I see no reason to make an order now.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 9. Mr McVeety relied on the grounds of appeal and submitted  the  Tribunal
    had erred in its approach to the earlier decision of Judge Manuel which
    had  been  based  on  virtually  the  same  evidence   and   was   made
    approximately 6 weeks before the current application was lodged. Whilst
    the Tribunal had referred to the case of  Devaseelan  (Second  Appeals,
    ECHR, Extra-Territorial Effect) [2002] UKAIT  702   it  had  failed  to
    apply the principles laid down in it. The  First-tier  Tribunal  should
    have commenced its considerations with Judge Manuel's decision and  the
    Tribunal should then have asked itself whether there was  any  material
    change to the facts presented to Judge Manuel. In this  current  appeal
    the Tribunal was concerned with the same facts save the sponsor was  30
    weeks pregnant with their second child.  The Tribunal's whole  approach
    was flawed. The reasons given for allowing the appeal were set  out  in
    paragraphs  [24]  and  [25]  of  the  Tribunal's  decision   and   were
    inadequate. Whilst the Tribunal noted that the respondent's  suspicions
    it failed to give those suspicions (Judge Manuel's findings) any weight
    when considering the appeal with the Tribunal effectively  allowing  it
    on the basis of demeanour as demonstrated  by  paragraph  [29]  of  its
    decision.

10. Mr Karnic invited me to allow the decision to stand. He  submitted  the
    Tribunal was aware of the legal principles and quoted  the  appropriate
    case law. The Tribunal explained why the appeal had  been  allowed  and
    that decision was open to it. The Tribunal had been  entitled  to  take
    into account the current circumstances  when  considering  whether  the
    marriage was a marriage of convenience. The Tribunal had taken evidence
    from witnesses and concluded the marriage was a marriage  of  substance
    as against a marriage of convenience. The Tribunal dealt with  all  the
    relevant points and was satisfied they were in  a  loving  and  genuine
    relationship. The respondent's submissions  amounted  to  nothing  more
    than a mere disagreement.

    FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

11. The respondent's application to  appeal  the  tribunal's  decision  was
    based on the premise that the Tribunal had failed to have regard to any
    of Judge Manuel's findings and consequently its approach was flawed.

12. Having heard the  respective  submissions  and  after  considering  the
    Tribunal's decision I reached the following conclusions.

13. Firstly, whilst the Tribunal was aware of Judge Manuel's  determination
    I am satisfied that it failed to take those findings  as  its  starting
    point. The principles of Devaseelan are important  because  a  Tribunal
    must not fall into the mistake of ignoring  findings  made  on  similar
    facts. To do so would mean that previous decisions would be ignored and
    large inconsistencies potentially could arise when parties re-litigated
    the same facts.

14. I have set out earlier the history and importantly Judge  Manuel  heard
    the appellant's first appeal on similar facts.  In considering  whether
    to grant a residence card it was  therefore  incumbent  to  take  those
    findings as a starting point. Negative findings were detailed in  Judge
    Manuel's decision and the mere fact the parties  presented  themselves,
    at a second appeal hearing, as a couple expecting a  second  child  did
    not alter the approach the Tribunal should have taken  to  the  earlier
    findings.

15. Judge Manuel had found that this was a  marriage  of  convenience  even
    though the parties were married with a child.  The  Tribunal's  finding
    that this was not a marriage of convenience was based primarily on  how
    they appeared on the last occasion.  In  paragraph  [29]  the  Tribunal
    referred to how "the appellant naturally took his child from his  wife"
    and "how the  sponsor  handed  their  sleeping  daughter  over  to  her
    husband". Cases should not be decided on demeanour.

16. The Tribunal failed to consider any of the negative  findings  made  by
    Judge  Manuel  including  the  fact  that  they  were  both  unreliable
    witnesses and the fact that merely having a child did  not  make  their
    relationship  or  marriage  genuine.  Judge  Manuel  had  concluded  in
    paragraph [28] of her decision that  the  appellant  entered  into  the
    marriage to enable him to remain in the United  Kingdom  and  this  was
    where the Tribunal should have commenced its considerations.

17. I am therefore satisfied that the Tribunal erred in  its  approach  and
    consequently the decision must be set aside.

18. I raised with the parties whether we  could  proceed  further  at  this
    hearing. Mr Karnic wished to call additional evidence and  I  indicated
    that I would give leave for that evidence and thereafter  both  parties
    could make submissions on how I should deal with the case.

    ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE

19. The appellant adopted a recent statement and confirmed that the sponsor
    had miscarried their third child approximately  three  months  ago.  He
    confirmed that they spoke to each other in  English  and  sometimes  in
    Urdu. Although his wife's Urdu skills were limited she understood  what
    he  asked  and  answered  her  correctly.  He  believed  that  if   his
    application was refused his wife and children would face a life without
    him. Under cross examination he confirmed that  his  wife  learnt  Urdu
    over a period of time. When they first met in January 2012 he explained
    that his English was okay and that was how they spoke to each other. He
    also stated that during  the  first  of  three  months  and  they  were
    together the sponsor agreed to change her religion to  his  because  he
    wanted her to and because she liked the Muslim religion.

20. The sponsor adopted her  witness  statement  and  confirmed  that  they
    conversed in English and  Urdu.  She  explained  that  she  learnt  his
    language because she liked it and they wanted to be able to speak  Urdu
    together. She disputed the respondent's claim that the marriage was not
    genuine explaining that they had been together for  over  three  years,
    had two children and had recently lost their third child. She explained
    that she had  given  different  answers  to  the  interviewing  officer
    because she was stressed  and  worried  that  the  appellant  would  be
    removed from the country. When asked what she would do if the appellant
    lost his appeal she stated that she did not know and she would not  let
    him leave. She indicated that her daughter had problems with her  heart
    and their son had problems with his leg and she  did  not  believe  she
    would be able to live without her husband here. She would be unable  to
    work if her husband was not present as she would have to look after the
    children. Under cross-examination she agreed that she  had  arrived  on
    January 1, 2012 intending to visit a friend. She explained that she met
    this appellant in the middle of January and that by the end of  January
    2012 they had moved in together. She was 18 or 19 years of age  at  the
    time and understood why  the  respondent  was  suspicious  about  their
    relationship. She confirmed that she had learned some English in school
    but she learnt other languages as well. She  stated  she  was  able  to
    undertake a conversation about religious conversion in the  early  part
    of 2012 and said that when they did not understand words they used  the
    Internet and a mobile to translate. When asked why he had  not  learned
    her language she explained that her language was  difficult  to  learn.
    She denied that their first meeting was arranged and maintained it  had
    been a chance meeting in a caf� shop.

    CLOSING SUBMISSIONS

21. Mr McVeety submitted that the Tribunal in April 2014 had adjudicated on
    these very facts and found that it was a sham marriage. He  pointed  to
    the fact that the sponsor had supposedly come in January  for  a  visit
    but this claim and the rest of their claim had been rejected  and  that
    decision had not been appealed. He invited me to  uphold  the  original
    decision made by Judge Manuel and not to go behind what she  had  said.
    The mere fact they were still together and had another  child  did  not
    alter the conception that the marriage was a marriage of convenience at
    its inception.  However,  if  the  Tribunal  felt  those  matters  were
    relevant Mr McVeety invited me to find that the lack  of  affection  in
    the witness statement by the appellant and the fact that  he  was  only
    concerned with the sponsor converting  were  significant  matters  when
    considering whether this was a marriage of  convenience.  He  submitted
    this was a sham marriage to enable him to stay. He was  here  illegally
    and was an overstayer and this was his  last  opportunity  to  try  and
    stay.  He invited me to dismiss the appeal.

22. Mr Karnic submitted that this was a marriage  of  substance.  They  had
    lived together since the end of January 2012 and had married in October
    2012. They had therefore been living together for over 3 �  years.  The
    fact that they were still together and had two  children  were  matters
    that had to be taken into account when considering whether the marriage
    was a marriage of  convenience.  The  respondent  had  interviewed  the
    appellant and sponsor but had not provided Form 4605 and following  the
    decision of Miah (interviewer's comments: disclosure: fairness)  [2014]
    UKUT 00515 reliance on the interviews were unfair.  He  invited  me  to
    find that this was a marriage of substance.

    CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS

23. The respondent opposed this application on the  basis  that  it  was  a
    marriage of convenience. Reliance is placed upon  an  earlier  Tribunal
    decision of Judge Manuel in  which  she  concluded  the  appellant  and
    sponsor were unreliable and they  had  entered  into  the  marriage  to
    enable the appellant to remain in the United Kingdom. In reaching  that
    decision Judge Manuel have  regard  to  the  interviews  given  by  the
    parties and their oral evidence.

24. Before considering the facts and circumstances of this appeal I believe
    it would be helpful to set out the relevant legislation.

25. There is no definition of marriage  of  convenience  or  sham  marriage
    within the Rules but both parties referred to Papajorgji (EEA spouse  -
    marriage of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038(IAC). The case refers
    to the Citizens Directive (EP and Council Directive  2004/38/EC)  which
    sets out the basic rules of European Union law regulating the admission
    of spouses of EU citizens who are not such citizens  themselves  (third
    country nationals).

26. Preamble 28 is as follows:

         "To guard against abuse of rights or fraud,  notably  marriages  of
         convenience or any other form of relationships contracted  for  the
         sole purpose of enjoying the right of free movement and  residence,
         Member States should have the possibility to  adopt  the  necessary
         measures."

27. Article 35 which is headed 'Abuse of Rights' then provides:

         "Member  States  may  adopt  the  necessary  measures  to   refuse,
         terminate or withdraw any right conferred by this Directive in  the
         case  of  abuse  of  rights  or  fraud,  such   as   marriages   of
         convenience."

28. The European Commission Handbook has  a  'Definition'  section  and  at
    section 2.1 and there is a definition of 'sole purpose' which  includes
    the following:

         "...  Therefore,  the  notion  of  'sole  purpose'  should  not  be
         interpreted literally (as being the unique  or  exclusive  purpose)
         but rather as meaning that the objective to  obtain  the  right  of
         entry and residence must be the predominant purpose of the  abusive
         conduct."

29. Thus in the case of Miah, at paragraph 5, when  the  President  of  the
    Tribunal summarised the ratio of Papajorgii and stated  that,  "However
    there is an evidential burden  on  the  Claimant  to  address  evidence
    justifying reasonable suspicion  that  the  marriage  in  question  was
    undertaken for the predominant purpose of securing residence rights" he
    was using a definition that was entirely consistent  with  the  Council
    Directive and the definition provided in the guidance  in  relation  to
    the issue of marriages of convenience.

30. There has been a previous finding by Judge Manuel that the marriage was
    a marriage of convenience. Although Mr Karnic argues that I should have
    regard to the relationship as it now is I am satisfied that the correct
    approach to assessing whether a marriage is a marriage of  convenience,
    when considered for the purposes of an EEA residence card, is to assess
    the position when the marriage took place and if the  sole  purpose  of
    that relationship was to enjoy the right  of  free  movement  when  the
    marriage was contracted it was a marriage of convenience and  continues
    to be so.  Judge Manuel found the mere fact parties had had a child did
    not alter the appellant's intention when he entered into  the  marriage
    and similarly the fact the parties have had a  second  child,  and  are
    apparently intent on remaining together, does not alter the  fact  that
    serious concerns about their intentions when the marriage  was  entered
    into remain unanswered and unaddressed.

31. In considering whether the  appellant  is  a  family  member  based  on
    marriage I am satisfied that  their  marriage  remains  a  marriage  of
    convenience and  consequently  the  appellant  is  not  entitled  to  a
    residence card as a spouse.

32. Mr Karnic did not  argue  any  alternative  provisions  under  the  EEA
    regulations and it may well be that in light of their time together and
    their current circumstances that the appellant and sponsor may  now  be
    able to  satisfy  the  respondent  that  they  are  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship and that they intend to remain  together.  Even
    if I accepted this was the case the respondent has a discretion when it
    comes to granting residence cards to partners and such  an  application
    must therefore be considered by the respondent.

33. Mr Karnic did raise an issue over their interview records but it  seems
    to me from the limited papers  before  me  that  Judge  Manuel  had  an
    interview record as she makes  various  references  to  that  document.
    Whether the Form 4605 exists is a matter that I'm unable  to  make  any
    finding of because it was an issue raised at this hearing for the first
    time and the respondent was not put on notice that it would be an issue
    and the relevant enquiries were therefore not be made.

34. In summary therefore I am satisfied this was a marriage of  convenience
    when it was entered into and in light of the legislation I am satisfied
    that this is the relevant date.

35. I therefore dismiss the appeal.

    DECISION

36. There was a material error.  I set aside the original  decision  and  I
    remake it and I dismiss the appeal under the 2006 EEA Regulations.
