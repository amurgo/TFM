                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1.     The Appellant appealed with permission granted by Upper Tribunal
         Judge Rintoul on 11 February  2015  against  the  determination  of
         First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hodgkinson  who  had   dismissed   the
         Appellant's appeal under Appendix FM  as  a  spouse  of  a  British
         Citizen and on human rights (Article 8 ECHR  family  life)  grounds
         against his removal in a determination promulgated on 15  September
         2014.

    2.     The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on 17 June 1984.
          The Appellant had married his British Citizen spouse while in  the
         United Kingdom lawfully on 13 December 2012.  He had then sought  a
         variation of leave to remain as a spouse.  Judge  Hodgkinson  found
         that Appendix FM was not met, in that the  income  requirement  had
         not been satisfied and that EX1 did not  apply:  see  [35]  of  the
         decision.  There were no compelling circumstances not  sufficiently
         recognised under the Immigration Rules which rendered the Secretary
         of State's decision disproportionate under Article 8 ECHR.

    3.     Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul
         because he considered that it was arguable that the judge had erred
         by failing to consider section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration
         and Asylum Act 2002 when reaching his decision.

    4.     Standard directions were made by the tribunal,  indicating  that
         the appeal would be reheard immediately if a material error of  law
         were found.  A rule 24 notice dated 25 February 2015  opposing  the
         appeal had been filed on the Respondent's behalf.

    Submissions - error of law

    5.     Mr Hussain for the Appellant relied on the grounds of onwards of
         appeal and the grant of permission  to  appeal.   Chikwamba  [2008]
         UKHL 40 was relevant but the judge had not considered it all.  More
         importantly, the judge had not dealt with the factors  set  out  in
         section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
         which weighed in the Appellant's favour.  Indeed the judge had  not
         mentioned 117B at all.   Although  Dube  [2015]  UKUT  00090  (IAC)
         showed that there need not be express reference to the statute, the
         judge was required to consider  the  factors.   He  had  not.   The
         Appellant was English speaking.  He had been in the United  Kingdom
         lawfully at all times.  Although it was accepted  that  the  income
         requirement of Appendix FM had not been met, that of itself did not
         mean that the Appellant would not be self  sufficient:  there  was,
         for example, free accommodation available.  Given that the  sponsor
         had lived in the United Kingdom since the age of  4,  spoke  little
         Bengali, and that her whole family lived in the United Kingdom, and
         that her mother was dependant on her, it was unreasonable to expect
         the British Citizen sponsor to live her family life with her spouse
         in Bangladesh: see, e.g., AB (Jamaica) [2007] EWCA Civ  1302.   The
         judge had not addressed proportionality adequately and had focussed
         excessively on the public interest.

    6.     Mr Kandola for the Respondent relied on the rule 24 notice.   He
         submitted that the judge's  decision  had  been  open  to  him  and
         sufficiently addressed  section  117B  although  it  had  not  been
         mentioned.  If the judge had failed to  state  that  the  Appellant
         spoke English it was not a material error of law.  The reality  was
         that the Appellant had not met  the  income  requirements  and  the
         judge had given adequate reasons for finding  that  there  were  no
         insurmountable obstacles to family life being  led  in  Bangladesh.
         SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 showed that the judge had taken  the
         right approach.

    7.     Mr Hussain addressed the tribunal in reply.  SS  (Congo)  [2015]
         EWCA Civ 387 showed that there remained a potential gap between the
         requirements of the Immigration Rules  and  Article  8  ECHR  which
         could render refusal/exclusion disproportionate.   Here  there  was
         just such a gap, which made the judge's decision unsustainable.

    8.     The tribunal indicated at the conclusion of submissions that its
         determination was reserved.

    No material error of law finding

    9.     It was not in dispute before Judge Hodgkinson that the Appellant
         failed to  meet  the  income  requirement  of  Appendix  FM.   That
         requirement has been controversial but MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ
         985 states the current law.  In the tribunal's judgment it was open
         to the judge to find that the demanding  requirements  of  EX.1  of
         Appendix FM were not met by the Appellant.  There was no suggestion
         that  the  judge  had  erred  in  his  findings   of   fact.    The
         determination  shows  that  the  judge  meticulously  recorded  the
         submissions made on the Appellant's  behalf:  see,  in  particular,
         [24] onwards of  the  determination.   He  noted  that  there  were
         various difficulties for the sponsor and her family if she left the
         United Kingdom but he explained why he found that  they  were  less
         serious than had been claimed and that there were no insurmountable
         obstacles: see [32] to [34] of the  determination.    That  finding
         disposed of any Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 issue,  because  Chikwamba
         was decided before the changes to the Immigration Rules  introduced
         on 9 July 2012.  The factual matrix of Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 was
         in any event far removed from the  facts  of  the  present  appeal.
         There was, for example, no fear of return to Bangladesh  by  either
         spouse. There is no error of law in Judge Hodgkinson's analysis  of
         the case under the Immigration Rules.

    10.    In the tribunal's  judgment,  Judge  Hodgkinson  had  adequately
         considered the  substance  of  section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  despite  making  no   express
         reference to the statute by name,  when  assessing  proportionality
         under Article 8 ECHR.  Dube [2015] UKUT 00090  (IAC)  applies.   It
         was not in dispute that  the  Appellant  spoke  English,  in  which
         language he gave his evidence: see [14] of the  determination.   It
         was a point in the Appellant's favour but it was hardly a  decisive
         one in itself and required no special mention.   If  that  approach
         were wrong, and the English language positive  factor  should  have
         been mentioned, the tribunal finds  in  the  alternative  that  any
         error of law was not material because the matter was  not  decisive
         when set against other factors: see Dube (above).

    11.    More relevant was section 117B(3), financial independence.   The
         definition of financial independence for the purposes of settlement
         in the United Kingdom as the spouse of a British Citizen is set out
         in Appendix FM.   For  such  purposes  the  earning  power  of  the
         applicant must be  ignored,  as  indeed  must  be  other  potential
         benefits such as free accommodation or third  party  support.   The
         sponsor's earnings fell well short of the applicable requirement of
         ï¿½18,600.  To that extent, therefore, financial independence did not
         exist and there was  no  such  positive  factor  available  to  the
         Appellant.  The inability to satisfy the financial requirements  of
         Appendix FM was not in issue and there was thus  no  need  for  the
         judge to say anything more on the subject.

    12.    It may be, in the light of SS (Congo) (above), that there  could
         be factual situations where there might be a gap in proportionality
         terms between Appendix FM and Article 8  ECHR.   How  that  squares
         with the principles of Miah and ors v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 261 will
         no doubt be explored.  But on the facts found by  the  judge  there
         was not only a large gap between the couple's actual income and the
         requirements of Appendix FM, there was also the choice open to them
         of living their family life in Bangladesh.  It  was  not  necessary
         for the judge to say so, but there  were  obviously  other  choices
         open to them as well, for example, for the sponsor to  seek  better
         paid employment in the United Kingdom and  then  to  make  a  fresh
         entry clearance application  for  the  Appellant.   It  was  not  a
         situation where there never any prospect  of  compliance  with  the
         Immigration Rules.  Nor was it a situation where there was no place
         in which the couple could safely live their  family  life:  as  the
         judge pointed out, the Appellant's family lived in  Bangladesh  and
         so there would an element of wider family  separation  whether  the
         couple lived in the United Kingdom or in Bangladesh.

    13.    A further relevant factor, as Mr Kandola submitted, was the fact
         that in terms  of  section  117B(5),  the  Appellant's  immigration
         status was precarious.  That term has yet to be defined judicially,
         but it is plain that while the Appellant was in the United  Kingdom
         lawfully  at  the  date  of  his  variation  of  leave  to   remain
         application, he had been admitted  to  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
         temporary purpose only which had  been  fulfilled  and  he  had  no
         expectation that settlement would become available to  him.   Again
         that factor  counted  against  the  Appellant,  so  it  was  hardly
         necessary for the judge to mention it.  Any such failure cannot  be
         said to be a material error of law.

    14.    The judge was entitled to find on the evidence before  him  that
         there   were   no   compelling,   compassionate   or    exceptional
         circumstances which might have required the Secretary of  State  to
         consider the exercise of discretion outside the  Immigration  Rules
         in the Appellant's favour.  On the contrary, it was obviously  open
         to the Appellant to submit a fresh and compliant application  at  a
         future date, and it was proportionate to the  legitimate  objective
         of immigration control to expect him to do so.

    15.    Patel v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 shows that Article 8 ECHR creates no
         general power to dispense with the requirements of the  Immigration
         Rules.  The tribunal finds that there was no material error of  law
         in the determination and there is no basis for interfering with the
         judge's decision.

    DECISION

    The making of the previous decision did not involve the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law and stands unchanged
