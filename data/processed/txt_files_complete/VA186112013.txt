For the Appellant:     Mr A Boyd, Temple & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal with permission against a  decision  by  Judge  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal S Taylor dismissing  an  appeal  against  refusal  of
   entry clearance as a visitor.

2) The appellant was born on 2 July 1988 and is a citizen  of  Russia.   The
   application giving rise to this appeal was made on 22 August  2013,  when
   the appellant sought entry clearance for  the  purpose  of  visiting  his
   wife, Sofya Belousova, a Russian citizen studying at the  Glasgow  School
   of Art.  In refusing the  application  the  respondent  stated  that  the
   appellant had made a false declaration  in  a  previous  application  for
   entry clearance.  A review dated 8 January 2014 by  the  Entry  Clearance
   Manager refers to an earlier application dated 14 October 2012  in  which
   it  was  said  the  appellant  neglected  to  declare  that  he  had   an
   acquaintance present in the UK, namely his Russian  girlfriend  (now  his
   spouse) who had been studying in Glasgow since 2011.  On the  basis  that
   the appellant had made a false declaration in his  previous  application,
   the current application  was  refused  under  paragraph  320(7B)  of  the
   Immigration Rules with a 10 year automatic  refusal  period  for  further
   applications from the decision of October 2012.

3) The appeal was considered by the First-tier Tribunal without  a  hearing.
   The judge had before him a letter dated 23 October 2013,  seemingly  from
   Ms Belousova, in which she explained that at  the  time  of  his  earlier
   application the appellant was not sure if she would agree  to  marry  him
   and he was even unsure of her location.  He preferred not to disclose the
   real nature of his  visit  as  he  thought  this  might  lead  the  Entry
   Clearance Officer to make enquiries of Ms Belousova and this would  alert
   her to his visit.

4) The judge found there was no scope for  the  exercise  of  discretion  in
   paragraph 320(7B).  Where the applicant  had  previously  used  deception
   then the subsequent application had to be  refused  unless  there  was  a
   human rights factor outside the Immigration Rules.  The appellant and  Ms
   Belousova were now married but  the  exception  in  favour  of  a  spouse
   seeking settlement did not apply as Ms Belousova had  limited  leave  and
   the application was for a visit and not for settlement.   Article  8  had
   been considered by the respondent and it  had  been  concluded  that  the
   parties could still meet as there  was  no  limitation  on  Ms  Belousova
   visiting the appellant in Russia.

5) In the application for permission to appeal it  was  contended  that  the
   appellant had in his latest application disclosed everything that he  was
   required to disclose.  He had also  disclosed  this  information  in  his
   previous applications.  He had been interviewed by telephone  in  respect
   of a previous application.  It was alleged  that  he  had  made  a  false
   declaration in an application before that  by  stating  that  he  had  no
   friends or family in the UK.  It was explained by the appellant,  and  by
   Ms Belousova, that Ms Belousova was neither a friend nor  family  at  the
   time.  Ms Belousova was no more than an acquaintance  and  the  appellant
   was not even sure she was  in  the  UK.   The  Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal was wrong to find that the appellant had  acknowledged  that  he
   did not give a truthful answer in a previous application.  The  appellant
   had never accepted that he had used deception.  Permission to appeal  was
   granted on the basis of these grounds.

6) A Rule 24 notice was submitted on behalf of the respondent  stating  that
   on the evidence the judge was entitled to find  that  the  refusal  under
   paragraph 320(7B) was justified.  The sponsor's letter indicated that the
   appellant had not been truthful although the appellant sought to  justify
   the reasons for that.  It was contradictory to suggest that  the  sponsor
   was only an acquaintance  of  the  appellant  when  the  letter  from  Ms
   Belousava indicated more than that.

7) At the hearing before  us  Mr  Matthews  acknowledged  that  the  earlier
   application for entry clearance from October  2012  was  not  before  the
   First-tier Tribunal and was not available for us to examine.   There  was
   no record of the interview carried out with the appellant.   Mr  Matthews
   indicated that he had a document verification report but he  acknowledged
   that this had not been before the First-tier Tribunal.  He accepted  that
   it was for the respondent to establish deception.

8) It was noted  that  no  application  had  been  made  to  adduce  further
   evidence.

9) Mr Matthews further pointed out that the application was made  after  the
   change to the rights of appeal for family visit  visa  applications.   It
   was noted, however, that Article 8 was raised in the grounds of appeal to
   the First-tier Tribunal.

10) For the appellant Mr Boyd submitted  that  there  was  no  deception  or
   dishonesty.

Discussion

11) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal appears to have been unaware as  to
   the limited jurisdiction of the Tribunal in this appeal.  The application
   giving rise to the present appeal was made on 22nd August 2013 after  the
   coming into force on 25th June 2013 of section 52 of the Crime and Courts
   Act 2013, which amends the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
   so that an appeal against refusal of a family visit visa may be made only
   on the grounds of human rights or racial discrimination  (The  Crime  and
   Courts  Act  2013  (Commencement  No  1  and  Transitional  and   Savings
   Provision) Order 2013,  SI  2013/1042).   The  Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal erred in law by disregarding this restriction on the  Tribunal's
   jurisdiction.  The judge had no jurisdiction to consider the appeal under
   the Immigration Rules.  Accordingly we set the decision aside and re-make
   it below in relation to Article 8 only.

12) So far as Article 8 was concerned, the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
   found that Article 8 was not engaged because there was no restriction  on
   the sponsor visiting the appellant  in  Russia.   The  appellant  and  Ms
   Belousova had not expressed an intention to live together as husband  and
   wife in the UK and the purpose of the  application  giving  rise  to  the
   appeal was for a visit for a limited period.

13) On this point we consider that the judge's reasoning was  correct.   The
   decision refusing entry clearance was not disproportionate because of the
   nature of the visit which was intended and because the appellant and  the
   sponsor did not intend to live together in the UK.  This was intended  to
   be a visit of limited duration only and there was no restriction  on  the
   sponsor visiting the appellant in Russia, the country of which  they  are
   both nationals.

14) There is, however, an aspect of the respondent's case  which  causes  us
   concern.  This is the finding that the appellant used deception in making
   an application for entry clearance  in  October  2012.   As  Mr  Matthews
   acknowledged, we did not have before us evidence to  establish  what  the
   appellant said or omitted to say about Ms Belousova in  relation  to  the
   application  for  entry  clearance  of  October  2012,  upon  which   the
   respondent sought to found the allegation of deception.  It is clear from
   a Visa Application Form (VAF) dated 4 September 2013,  which  was  before
   us, that  the  application  form  asks  about  family  members  or  other
   relatives in the UK.  The appellant's position is that at the time of the
   October 2012 application Ms Belousova was neither a family member  nor  a
   relative.  At most she might  have  been  described  as  the  appellant's
   girlfriend, although the appellant himself seems to have  been  uncertain
   at that point  about  the  status  of  the  relationship.   He  was  also
   uncertain as to the whereabouts of  Ms  Belousova  at  the  time  of  his
   proposed visit.  He thought it was possible, as he had sought to  explain
   and as Ms Belousova had explained in her letter, that she had returned to
   Russia to visit her parents.

15) The situation at the time of the October 2012 application was  that  the
   appellant was a young man who hoped to locate his girlfriend in  the  UK,
   where she was studying, and propose to her, but at the time he  made  his
   application for entry clearance he did not know whether she would  accept
   his proposal or whether she was even in the  UK.   These  facts,  on  the
   basis of the evidence set out before us, which does  not  include  either
   the VAF of  October  2012  or  any  interview  record,  hardly  seems  to
   constitute a basis for establishing an attempt to obtain entry  clearance
   by deception, as the respondent has maintained.

16) The documentary evidence refers to a telephone interview conducted  with
   the appellant on 20 May 2013 but, as Ms Belousova states in her letter of
   23 October 2013, this  was  an  interview  in  connection  with  a  later
   application made in May 2013 and not in respect  of  the  application  of
   October 2012 in which it is alleged  deception  was  used.   We  have  no
   record before us of what precisely was said at the  telephone  interview.



17) It seems that when the appellant was interviewed by telephone on 20  May
   2013 he acknowledged that when making his application in October 2012  he
   did not disclose his intention to see Ms Belousova  and  to  ask  her  to
   marry him.  At no point, however, does any consideration appear  to  have
   been given to the crucial question of whether the appellant was under any
   obligation to disclose this intention when completing the VAF in  October
   2012.  The VAF asked him only about family members or other relatives  in
   the UK, and not about friends.  At the time he made  the  application  Ms
   Belousova was not related to the appellant and was not even his fianc�e.

18) Similarly, the letter dated 23 October 2013 from  Ms  Belousova  appears
   to have been written on the basis  that  the  appellant  was  under  some
   obligation to disclose his intention to see Ms Belousova and ask  her  to
   marry him when he applied for entry clearance in October 2012.  It  might
   be argued that this was a material fact in relation  to  the  application
   but it would have been material only if  there  was  evidence  suggesting
   that the appellant intended to remain in the  UK  with  Ms  Belousova  in
   breach of any leave he might have been given.  There is no evidence  that
   this was the appellant's intention.

19) Accordingly we are far from satisfied on the  evidence  before  us  that
   the respondent has an adequate basis for concluding  that  the  appellant
   attempted  to  use  deception  when  making  his  application  for  entry
   clearance in October 2012.

20) No application for anonymity has been made and we do not  consider  that
   any order to this effect is appropriate

Conclusions

21) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve  the
   making of an error on a point of law.

22) We set aside the decision.

23) We re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it under Article  8,
   subject to the reservations as to the respondent's position which we have
   expressed.



Fee Award        (Note: This is not part of the determination)

As the appeal has been dismissed, no fee award can be made.
