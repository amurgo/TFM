Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer.
For the Respondent:    Mr T Chowdhury, of Kingdom Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal.  The respondent, whom we shall
    call "the claimant", is a national of Bangladesh now  aged  18,  having
    been born on 13 April 1997.  Following a successful appeal  he  arrived
    in the United Kingdom on a visitor's visa valid for six  months  on  28
    March 2010 and upon its expiry remained without leave.   He applied for
    further leave to remain on 31 October 2011, 28 December 2011 and 6 July
    2012: all those applications were refused.   On  10  February  2014  he
    applied for asylum.  That claim was refused on 6 January 2015  and  the
    claimant was served with a decision to remove him under  s  10  of  the
    1999 Act, and with a notice under s 120  requiring  him  to  state  any
    other reasons that he might have for remaining in the  United  Kingdom.
    The claimant responded to that notice under cover of a letter from  his
    solicitors dated 21 February 2014,  repeating  the  asylum  grounds  in
    summary and relying in addition on grounds under article 8 on the basis
    that the claimant was well  settled  with  his  family  in  the  United
    Kingdom and doing well at school.  In  a  ceremony  divided  between  8
    April 2015 and 8 June 2015 the claimant married a British citizen.   On
    23 June 2015 his appeal was heard by  Judge  Eames  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. At the beginning of the hearing Mr Chowdhury of Kingdom Solicitors, who
    has represented the claimant throughout,  wholly  withdrew  the  asylum
    claim and indicated that, under  the  section  120  procedure,  he  now
    asserted solely that the claimant was entitled  under  the  Immigration
    Rules (in particular Appendix FM) to leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The presenting officer objected, saying that the claimant was
    attempting to evade the application fee and the checks  that  the  Home
    Office would normally run  on  the  settlement  application  under  the
    Rules.  She did, however, indicate that if the appeal were  to  proceed
    on this basis she would be able to deal with it.  The judge allowed the
    amendment of the grounds, apparently on the basis  that  "human  rights
    arguments in general can be  assumed  to  be  in  play  in  almost  any
    appeal", and because the respondent now had notice of the issue.  There
    was an adjournment to enable the presenting officer to peruse  any  new
    documents.  It is not said that the procedure adopted by the judge  was
    unfair to the Secretary of State.

 3. Further, it is clear that the claimant was entitled to act as  he  did.
    It was the Secretary of State's decision to serve a Section 120 Notice,
    which permitted the claimant to raise issues  entirely  different  from
    his asylum and (by virtue of s 85(2) and (3) and 86(2)(b) required  the
    judge to consider  and  determine  those  issues.   Thus,  despite  the
    Presenting Officer's expressed disquiet, no procedural issue arises  in
    this appeal at either level.

 4. The judge  heard  evidence  and  submissions  from  both  parties.   He
    directed his attention to the Immigration Rules,  on  which  alone  the
    claimant now relied.  The judge concluded that  the  claimant  met  the
    requirements of the relevant rules, and so allowed the appeal.

 5. In this appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the Secretary of State challenges
    the judge's conclusions.  In the course of his submissions Mr  Richards
    described the judge's conclusion as irrational.  Eight specific  points
    are taken in the grounds  of  appeal;  but  in  fact  there  are  other
    difficulties in the judge's analysis of  the  relevant  rules  and  his
    conclusions on them.

 6. The relevant rules are in Appendix FM to the Statement  of  Changes  in
    Immigration Rules, HC 395 (as amended) and are as follows:

        "R-LTRP.1.1. The requirements to be met for limited leave to remain
        as a partner are -
           (a) the applicant and their partner must be in the UK;
           (b) the applicant must have made a valid application for limited
              or indefinite leave to remain as a partner; and either
           (c) (i)   the applicant must not fall for refusal under  Section
                 S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
              (ii) the applicant meets all of the requirements of Section E-
                 LTRP: Eligibility for leave to remain as a partner; or
           (d) (i)  the applicant must not fall for refusal under Section S-
                 LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
              (ii) the applicant meets the requirements  of  paragraphs  E-
                 LTRP.1.2-1.12. and E-LTRP.2.1.; and
              (iii) paragraph EX.1. applies."

        "GEN.1.9. In this Appendix:
           (a) the requirement to make a valid application will  not  apply
              when the Article 8 claim is raised:
              (i)  as part of an asylum claim, or  as  part  of  a  further
                 submission  in  person  after  an  asylum  claim  has  been
                 refused;
              (ii) where a migrant is in immigration detention... or;
              (iii)     in  an  appeal  (subject  to  the  consent  of  the
                 Secretary of State where applicable); and
           (b) where an application or claim raising Article 8 is  made  in
              any   of   the   circumstances   specified    in    paragraph
              GEN.1.9.(a)... the requirements of paragraphs  R-LTRP.1.1.(c)
              and R-LTRPT.1.1.(c) are not met. "


 7. In this appeal it is not said that the claimant fell for refusal  under
    the suitability requirements in Section S-LTR.   The  relationship  and
    status requirements mentioned in  paragraph  R-LTRP.1.1(d)(ii)  are  as
    follows:

        "ELTRP.1.2. The applicant's partner must be -
           (a) a British Citizen in the UK;
           (b) present and settle in the UK; or
           (c)  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or  as  a  person   with
           humanitarian protection.
        E-LTRP.1.3.  The applicant must be aged 18 or over at the  date  of
        application.
        E-LTRP.1.4.  The partner must be aged 18 or over  at  the  date  of
        application.
        E-LTRP.1.5. The applicant and their partner must not be within  the
        prohibited degree of relationship.
        E-LTRP.1.6.  The applicant and  their  partner  must  have  met  in
        person.
        E-LTRP.1.7.  The  relationship  between  the  applicant  and  their
        partner must be genuine and subsisting.
        E-LTRP.1.8.  If the applicant and partner are married or in a civil
        partnership it must be a valid marriage or  civil  partnership,  as
        specified.
        E-LTRP.1.9. Any previous relationship of  the  applicant  or  their
        partner  must  have  broken  down  permanently,  unless  it  is   a
        relationship which falls within paragraph 278(i) of these Rules.
        E-LTRP.1.10. The applicant and their partner must  intend  to  live
        together permanently in the UK and, in any application for  further
        leave to remain as a partner (except where the applicant is in  the
        UK as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner) and in any application
        for indefinite leave to remain as a  partner,  the  applicant  must
        provide evidence that, since  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  was
        granted under paragraph  D-ECP1.1.  or  since  the  last  grant  of
        limited leave to remain as  a  partner,  the  applicant  and  their
        partner have lived together in the UK  or  there  is  good  reason,
        consistent with a continuing intention to live together permanently
        in the UK, for any period in which they have not done so.
        E-LTRP.1.11.  If the applicant  is  in  the  UK  with  leave  as  a
        fianc�(e) or proposed civil  partner  and  the  marriage  or  civil
        partnership did not take place during that period of  leave,  there
        must be good reason why and evidence that it will take place within
        the next 6 months.
        E-LTRP.1.12. The applicant's  partner  cannot  be  the  applicant's
        fianc�(e) or proposed  civil  partner,  unless  the  applicant  was
        granted entry clearance as  that  person's  fianc�(e)  or  proposed
        civil partner.


        E-LTRP.2.1.  The applicant must not be in the UK -
           (a) as a visitor; or
           (b) with valid leave granted for a period of 6 months  or  less,
              unless that leave  is  as  a   fianc�(e)  or  proposed  civil
              partner ...."

 8. Section EX, so far as relevant is as follows:

        "EX.1. This paragraph applies if
        (a) ... or
        (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
        partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
        UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
        there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
        continuing outside the UK.


        EX.2.  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
        obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which  would  be
        faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their  family
        life together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or
        would entail very serious  hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their
        partner."

 9.  The  judge's  conclusion  was  that  the  claimant  met  the  relevant
    requirements of R-LTRP.1.1(a) and (b); that he met the requirements  of
    those paragraphs of E-LTRP.1.2-1.12 and E-LTRP.2.1, as required  by  R-
    LTRP.1.1(d)(ii), and that paragraph EX.1. applied  to  him.   In  these
    circumstances the judge concluded that the  claimant  was  entitled  to
    leave to remain under Section R-LTRP of Appendix FM.  The Secretary  of
    State's grounds of appeal are directed to the conclusions  in  relation
    to paragraph EX.1., but before we get there we should draw attention to
    our concerns in relation to the other requirements of the  Rules.    We
    work through them in the order in which they appear in the  Rules.   So
    far as concerns R-LTRP.1.1(a) there is no problem: the claimant and his
    wife are in the United Kingdom.  So far as concerns the requirement  in
    sub-paragraph  (b)  that  the  claimant  "must  have   made   a   valid
    application", the judge said this at [34]:

        "I find they have made a valid application.  Noting  the  terms  of
        paragraph GEN.1.9, I deem the amendment of their present grounds of
        appeal  to  have  that  effect.   So  R-LTRP.1.1(a)  and  (b)   are
        satisfied."

10. We do not think that is quite right: because of the terms  of  GEN.1.9,
    the position was that, as  the  article  8  claim  was  raised  "in  an
    appeal", the requirement to have made an  application  did  not  apply.
    The judge was right in  finding  that  sub-paragraph  (b)  was  not  an
    obstacle to the claimant, but for the wrong  reason.   This  difficulty
    has a legacy, however, in the judge's treatment of E-L-TRP1.3 and  1.4.
    In relation to E-LTRP.1.3 and 1.4, the judge said this at [36]:

        "E-LTRP.1.3: I note that the appellant  made  his  original  asylum
        claim whilst under 18.  His  present  claim,  as  now  amended,  is
        effectively a human rights claim as of the date on which  the  s120
        amendment application is  allowed  -  that  is,  the  date  of  the
        hearing, which is when I allow the application.   At  the  date  of
        hearing, the appellant is aged 18.


        E-LTRP.1.4: his wife is over 18."

11. That reasoning poses some difficulties.  As we have  pointed  out,  the
    article 8 claim was made in the s 120 notice, that  is  to  say  on  21
    February 2014.  At that date the claimant was under  18.   As  we  have
    also pointed out, the judge did not have a role in allowing that  claim
    to be made: the human rights  claim  (including  one  governed  by  the
    Rules) having been made in the course of the s 120 procedure, the judge
    was obliged to determine it.  We do not think that it can be  right  to
    say that in the present case the article 8 claim was  made  at  a  time
    when the claimant was over 18.  What  is  far  from  clear  is  whether
    paragraphs E-LTRP.1.3 and  E-LTRP.1.4  apply  where  paragraph  GEN.1.9
    applies.  On the one hand it is clear from the latter  provision  that,
    in a case such as the present, no  application  is  necessary;  on  the
    other hand it is a general provision of Appendix FM that applicants for
    entry clearance or leave to remain  as  partners  must  be,  and  their
    partners must be, over the age of 18.  Where a  formal  application  is
    made it will clearly fail if either the applicant  or  the  applicant's
    partner is under the age of 18; and their attaining the age or ages  of
    18 between application and decision (or decision on appeal)  would  not
    help them, because of the wording of the Rule  ("at  the  date  of  the
    application").   That  being  the  general   principle   for   ordinary
    applications, we think it is extremely unlikely that it is intended not
    to apply to cases where no application is necessary.   Having not heard
    full argument on the issue we approach it with caution, but it  appears
    to us that where paragraph GEN.1.9 applies, the references to "the date
    of the application" must be taken to be references to the date  of  the
    claim.  If that is right, the claimant did not meet the requirements of
    paragraph E-LTRP.1.3.  The applicant's wife is aged 27, and so was aged
    18 or over at all material times.

12. No issue arises on the judge's treatment  of  the  other  parts  of  E-
    LTRP.1.2-1.12.  He regarded them all as  having  been  met  and  having
    reached that conclusion he wrote at  [37]  that  "R-LTRP.1.1(d)(ii)  is
    therefore met".  But the last-mentioned provision  requires  also  that
    the provisions of E-LTRP.2.1 be met.  The judge does not deal with this
    at all.  This raises another point of interpretation which  is  not  at
    all easy.  Is (or was) the claimant in the UK "as a  visitor"?  He  was
    last admitted as a visitor, but his  leave  has  expired.   He  has  no
    "valid leave" of any period, so sub-paragraph (b)  does  not  apply  to
    him.  E-LTRP.2.2(b) requires an applicant  not  to  be  in  the  Untied
    Kingdom in breach of immigration laws, but by its own terms  and  those
    of R-LTR.1.1(d)(ii),  that  is  not  a  provision  which  applies  when
    paragraph EX.1 does.  This is  another  issue  on  which  we  heard  no
    argument, because it is not raised by  the  Secretary  of  State  as  a
    ground of appeal; because of the view which we have reached overall  on
    the appeal, we do not need to make  a  decision  on  it.   We  do  not,
    however, think it was open to the judge simply to ignore this provision
    of the Rules, as he did.

13. In particular for the reasons we have given in relation to paragraph E-
    LTRP.1.3, we doubt whether the judge was right in  thinking  that  only
    paragraph EX.1 was in issue.  It was, however, only his conclusions  on
    the latter paragraph that were specifically challenged by the Secretary
    of State.  We need to set them out  in  full.   We  have  replaced  the
    judge's bullet points with numbers, to make reference easier:

        "38.  In order to succeed the appellant must  show  that  paragraph
             EX.1 is met therefore.  I have  had  regard  to  the  arguments
             about the degree of difficulty that the appellant and his  wife
             might face if they went to Bangladesh to try to continue  their
             family life there together.   Factors  which  tend  to  suggest
             difficulty are these:


               i) [A]  is  British  born  and  raised.   She  has  not  had
                  experience of living in Bangladesh.  She describes it  as
                  a "3rd world country".


              ii) She has no family at all in Bangladesh.  Her only  family
                  members and relatives are in the UK.


             iii)  Moving there would uproot her from  her  family,  social
                  life and successful career.  That would,  I  find,  be  a
                  significant  difficulty.   It  could   not   readily   be
                  overcome.


              iv)  Her employment prospects there are unknown.


               v)  Bengali is only her second language; she is not fluent.


              vi)  The appellant is part-way through an education which, if
                  completed,   would    result    in    genuinely    useful
                  qualifications and a likely boost to  his  employability;
                  if interrupted only partly completed, these  studies  may
                  prove to be no use.


             vii)  All the appellant's siblings are in the UK.


            viii)   The  appellant  fears  for  his  life  because  of  his
                  brother's politics; there have  been  threats,  he  says.
                  Without necessarily finding that he has proven this  part
                  of his case adequately to fully ground - on its own -  an
                  asylum   or   humanitarian   protection   claim,   I   do
                  nevertheless find that there is sufficient factual  merit
                  in this claim for it to count as a credible factor in the
                  assessment of significant difficulty on return.  It  does
                  constitute an obstacle that  could  not  be  overcome  or
                  would entail very serious hardship for the appellant,  in
                  my view.


              ix) The appellant's wife's father's  property  in  Bangladesh
                  (see below) whilst   ostensibly available  would  not  be
                  available in a way that would be acceptable to the family
                  traditions subscribed to by the appellant's wife and  her
                  family.


               x) It is not known whether the appellant's wife  would  gain
                  leave to remain in Bangladesh.


        39. Militating against a conclusion that there  are  insurmountable
           obstacles are the
              following factors:


          i) The appellant's mother is in Bangladesh.


              ii) His wife's father owns a house which, even if not  ideal,
                  sounds as if it is habitable.


             iii) The appellant has lived  through  all  his  childhood  in
                  Bangladesh.  He is fluent in Bengali.


              iv) The appellant's wife is from a Bangladeshi background  in
                  the UK.  She  may  not  have  lived  there  but  she  has
                  visited; and she  may  have  some  understanding  of  the
                  culture there.


     v) The appellant's wife is free to  enter  Bangladesh  with  her  open
        visa.


        40. Assessing those factors in the round, and noting in  particular
           the requirement of "very serious hardship" in EX.2,  I  find  on
           balance that the overall matrix of obstacles to family  life  in
           Bangladesh are indeed insurmountable.  They are  principally  so
           in respect of the appellant's wife.  It is she  who  would  face
           the gravest difficulties, amongst which the loss of  her  family
           including her parents, her social  milieu  and  her  valued  job
           count highly in my view.  In reaching that conclusion  I  stress
           that the risk  the  appellant  alleges  is  not  central  to  my
           analysis; it  is  a  factor  which  contributes  to  an  overall
           hardship but is not the linchpin of his case."


14. We heard submissions from Mr Richards on these  issues.   Mr  Chowdhury
    did not provide any substantive reply to any of the challenges, save to
    submit that the judge's overall conclusion  was  open  to  him  on  the
    evidence.  It appears to us that the Secretary  of  State's  challenges
    are, for the most part, well-founded.  It is convenient to  begin  with
    [38](iv) and (x).  At [31], the judge had reminded himself that it  was
    for the claimant to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that he
    met the requirements of the Rules.  The conclusions  in  the  two  sub-
    paragraphs mentioned, however, are based  purely  on  speculation.   Mr
    Chowdhury confirmed to us at the hearing that there was no evidence  in
    relation to either of them.  In these circumstances it cannot be  right
    for the judge to take them into account.  They simply fall out  of  the
    equation.  The same applies to the second part of [38](vi); and, so far
    as the claimant's being "part-way through an education"  is  concerned,
    there  is  no  evidence  that  he  cannot  complete  his  education  in
    Bangladesh.  We do not know why the judge took into account  [38](vii).
    There was no evidence that there is any dependence between the claimant
    and his siblings, or that he would lose touch with them entirely if  he
    lived in Bangladesh.  It is certainly difficult to  see  how  the  fact
    that one's siblings are in another country mean that family  life  with
    one's spouse suffers difficulties.

15. So far as concerns  [38](viii),  the  position  is  that  the  claimant
    withdrew  his  asylum  claim.   That  had  both  a  substantive  and  a
    procedural consequence.  The first is that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    refusal of the asylum claim is  the  last  determination  of  it.   The
    procedural consequence is that, as the grounds of appeal point out, the
    Secretary of State did not cross-examine the claimant  or  any  of  the
    other witnesses about it.  The Secretary of State's conclusion  on  the
    asylum claim was that it was not made out, even to the applicable lower
    standard, and the claimant did not challenge that conclusion before the
    judge.  Substantively, therefore, it is extremely difficult to see  how
    the judge could conclude that there was "sufficient  factual  merit  in
    the claim for it to count as a credible factor  in  the  assessment  of
    significant difficulty on return", and  as  constituting  "an  obstacle
    that could not be overcome or would entail very  serious  hardship  for
    the appellant".  The judge was taking into account  matters  which  the
    claimant has not only failed to prove to the lower standard but has not
    sought to prove.  In our judgement, [38](viii) is therefore also purely
    speculative.

16. Turning then to the factors relating  specifically  to  the  claimant's
    spouse, it is right to say that she is "British born and  raised",  but
    she has visited Bangladesh.  Her description of  it  noted  in  [38](i)
    does not appear to have any  impact  on  whether  there  would  be  any
    serious hardship in her living with her husband there.  It is right  to
    say, as noted in [38](ii) that her family is all in the United Kingdom;
    but she is an educated woman, aged 27 and in employment; if  she  lives
    in Bangladesh she will still be able to be in contact with  her  family
    and will no doubt be able to visit them in the United Kingdom from time
    to time; again it is difficult to see that having family  members  only
    in another country would entail very serious hardship  in  living  with
    the claimant in Bangladesh.  Moving to Bangladesh would indeed  "uproot
    her"; but as a wife she has already left her own  family  to  join  her
    husband's; and there  were  no  particular  features  in  the  evidence
    suggesting that her social life was one a  disruption  of  which  would
    cause her "very significant difficulties".  So far as her employment is
    concerned, we have already made our comments  on  [38](iv).  The  judge
    says at [38](iii) that (apparently) the  combination  of  the  loss  of
    family, social life and career  would  be  "a  significant  difficulty"
    which "could not readily be overcome".  That is  a  substantially  more
    relaxed test than imposed  by  paragraph  EX.2.   So  far  as  concerns
    language,  the  statement  at  [38](v)  is  correct  according  to  the
    evidence; but she speaks Bengali and so far as her life  in  Bangladesh
    with her husband is concerned, the position  is  that  they  have  both
    English and Bengali in common and there is no reason for supposing that
    her linguistic skills would prevent her from conducting  ordinary  life
    in Bangladesh.

17. The evidence in relation to the house was set out by the judge at [16]:


          "Her father had a house there in Sylhet but she did not  know  the
          address.  She did not know whether this was  close  to  where  her
          husband had lived.  The only people living in the house were  some
          maids and servants looking after the building and the crops there.
           It was not a house that she and her husband would be able to live
          in, not least because in their culture a daughter would  not  live
          in her father's house. "

18. If the cultural assertion be accepted, the conclusion to  be  drawn  is
    that the claimant's wife's father has unused residential  property  and
    agricultural land, and sufficient funds to maintain  servants  to  look
    after them.  There is no evidence  that  that  resource  would  not  be
    available to the claimant and his wife, if necessary in another form.

19. Thus, each one of  the  factors  taken  into  account  as  meeting  the
    requirements of paragraph EX.2 is either a factor which,  for  lack  of
    evidence, should not have been taken into account, or  a  factor  which
    cannot properly establish the requirements  of  that  paragraph,  or  a
    factor which tends to point in the opposite direction.  Our  conclusion
    is that the judge's decision was not properly  based  on  the  evidence
    before him, and was one which he was not entitled to come to.

20. As we see it, the relevant facts are as follows.  The claimant is a man
    over 18, educated to a certain level in this country, but brought up in
    Bangladesh, where his mother still is.  The appellant's wife is 27  and
    well educated; she has no ties to  family  in  this  country  which  go
    further than ordinary family affection.  She has chosen to throw in her
    lot with the claimant.  Her father is  a  man  of  substance  who  owns
    property in Bangladesh and it is not said that  the  claimant  and  his
    wife will not have anywhere to live.  There is no evidence that  either
    of them will not be able to obtain employment;  they  both  speak  both
    English and Bengali, the latter to a more limited extent in  her  case.
    They are both free to enter Bangladesh.  If they do  go  to  Bangladesh
    together, the social  life  of  both  of  them  will  no  doubt  suffer
    interruption and they will be further from their UK relatives than they
    have been recently.  Taking these factors  as  a  whole,  it  does  not
    appear  to  us  that  they  come  anywhere  near   establishing   "very
    significant difficulties"  which  will  be  faced  by  either  of  them
    continuing their family life outside the UK and  "which  could  not  be
    overcome or would entail very serious hardship" for either of them.  On
    the evidence, as it appears to us, this is an assessment which, on  the
    evidence before the judge, could only properly go one way.

21. As indicated earlier  in  this  determination,  we  have  some  concern
    whether in any event the applicant met the requirements of paragraph R-
    LTRP.1.1(d)(ii); but, in our judgment, the requirements of paragraph R-
    LTRP1.1(d)(iii) did not apply to him in any event.  For completeness we
    should add that the alternative of paragraph R-LTRP.1.1(c) cannot avail
    the claimant.  It is ruled out by GEN.1.9(b): the  claimant  relies  on
    GEN.1.9(iii) and in those circumstances GEN.1.9(b)  provides  that  the
    requirements of R-LTRP.1.1.(c) "are  not  met".    In  any  event,  the
    claimant's partner's income is below  (albeit  only  just  below)  that
    required by paragraph E-ECP.3.1(a).  The claimant failed to  show  that
    he met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

22. No separate claim is raised outside the Rules, but the facts  which  we
    have set out demonstrate that there is no possible basis upon which the
    Secretary of State or the judge ought to have reached the view that the
    situation of the claimant and his partner was such that  they  have  an
    article 8 right to remain in the United Kingdom despite failing to meet
    the requirements of the Rules.

23. For the foregoing reasons we find that Judge Eames' decision  erred  in
    law.  We set it aside, and we substitute a determination dismissing the
    claimant's appeal.
