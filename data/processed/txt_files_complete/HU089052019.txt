                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal  Judge  Monaghan  ('the  Judge')  promulgated  on  the  23
        September 2019 in which the Judge dismissed the appellant's  appeal
        on human rights grounds.



Background


     2. The appellant is a male citizen of Turkey  born  on  the  15  April
        1977.
     3. The appellant  claims  to  have  arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom,
        unlawfully, on 4 December 1988. He claimed  asylum  on  7  December
        1998 which was refused leading to  the  appellant  becoming  appeal
        rights exhausted on 13 August 2004.  He  later  absconded  but  was
        encountered during an enforcement operation in Sheffield on 20  May
        2016. A number of applications in different  capacities  were  made
        and refused, leading to a further application on  2  May  2019  for
        leave to remain on human rights grounds  which  was  also  refused.
        This is the refusal appealed before the Judge.
     4. The Judge addresses the ability of the appellant to  succeed  under
        the Immigration Rules between [96 - 105], concluding the  appellant
        had failed to show he was entitled to leave on this basis.
     5. At [96] the  Judge  finds  the  appellant  could  not  satisfy  the
        requirements  of  paragraph  276  ADE(1)  as  he  had   not   lived
        continuously in the United Kingdom for at least 20 years. The Judge
        did not dispute that the appellant had entered the  United  Kingdom
        on 4 December 1988 but found the application for  leave  to  remain
        was made on 28 September 2018 and the decision to refuse on  2  May
        2019, meaning the necessary 20 years had not been met.
     6. At [99] the Judge finds the appellant cannot meet  the  suitability
        requirements of the Immigration Rules;  noting  the  appellant  had
        failed to pay litigation costs awarded to the Home  Office  at  the
        date of the application  but  found  this  was,  in  any  event,  a
        discretionary ground for refusal.
     7. The Judge considers article 8 ECHR outside the Rules between [106 -
        112] concluding that any interference with the appellant's  private
        life is proportionate.
     8. The  appellant  relied  upon  two  grounds  of  appeal,  the  first
        asserting the Judge erred in law in assessing whether the appellant
        had been residing in the United Kingdom for  20  continuous  years.
        The respondent in the refusal letter  of  5  May  2019  stated  the
        appellant had failed to show evidence of residence from  2007  when
        he absconded until 2011 and then nothing from  2012  to  2016.  The
        Judge accepted  the  oral  evidence  of  the  appellant's  brother,
        finding there was evidence to support a finding that the  appellant
        had been seen at his brother's business  fairly  regularly  between
        2007 and the present day, at [86]. The appellant asserts  that  the
        Judge's finding there was no reliable evidence of  the  appellant's
        whereabouts between 2002 and  2005  is  not  a  period  in  dispute
        between the parties and was not referred to in the  refusal  letter
        as between 2002 and 2005 the appellant was in  the  United  Kingdom
        going  through  his  asylum  appeal  and   subject   to   reporting
        requirements which he honoured until 2007. It is asserted the Judge
        failed to consider this evidence which was materially  relevant  to
        the merits of the article 8 element of the appeal.
     9. Ground 2 asserts the Judge failed to make  clear  findings  on  the
        suitability requirements in that notwithstanding noting that  S-LTR
        is discretionary, no specific findings were made on the implication
        of that.
    10. Permission appeal was granted a Designated Judge of the  First-tier
        Tribunal, the operative part of the grant being  in  the  following
        terms:


        It is arguable the Judge erred in law by not taking account of time
        spent in the United Kingdom  by  the  appellant  subsequent  to  28
        September 2018, being the date of  his  application  for  leave  to
        remain and gave no reason why she did not take account of this with
        reference to s.85(4) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
        as amended.


        The  Judge  at  paragraph  99  with  reference  to  the   Appellant
        outstanding litigation and  debt  and  his  suitability  for  leave
        simply noted that the ground for refusal was a discretionary ground
        but did not consider whether discretion had been considered by  the
        respondent.


        Both grounds are arguable and permission to appeal is granted.


    11. There is no Rule 24 response from the Secretary of  State  although
        Mr McVeety confirmed at the outset that the appeal is opposed.




Error of law


    12. Paragraph 276 ADE of the Immigration Rules states:


        276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
        remain on the grounds of private life in the UK  are  that  at  the
        date of application, the applicant:
           (i) does not fall for  refusal  under  any  of  the  grounds  in
           Section S-LTR 1.1 to S-LTR 2.2. and S-LTR.3.1. to S-LTR.4.5.  in
           Appendix FM; and
           (ii) has made a valid application for leave  to  remain  on  the
           grounds of private life in the UK; and
           (iii) has lived continuously in the UK for  at  least  20  years
           (discounting any period of imprisonment); or
           (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously  in
           the  UK  for  at  least  7  years  (discounting  any  period  of
           imprisonment) and it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
           applicant to leave the UK; or
           (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and  has  spent
           at least  half  of  his  life  living  continuously  in  the  UK
           (discounting any period of imprisonment); or
           (vi) subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18  years  or  above,
           has lived  continuously  in  the  UK  for  less  than  20  years
           (discounting any period of imprisonment) but there would be very
           significant obstacles to the applicant's  integration  into  the
           country to which he would have to go if required  to  leave  the
           UK.
        276ADE (2). Sub-paragraph (1)(vi) does not apply, and  may  not  be
        relied upon, in circumstances in which it is proposed to  return  a
        person to a third country pursuant to Schedule 3 to the Asylum  and
        Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004.
    13. It is therefore the specific requirements  of  the  Rule  that  the
        minimum 20-year period required by 276ADE(1)(iii)  is  achieved  by
        the date of application which, on the chronology, was not shown  to
        have been achieved by the appellant.
    14. Between [80 - 84], when discussing the evidence relating to time in
        the UK, the Judge writes:


        80.  It was clear to me that the Appellant was hesitant and  unsure
             about this evidence and required prompting at some points from
             Mr Mullarkey. Given that he was claiming to have lived at  the
             address in Darnall in 2017, which is recently, it casts  doubt
             on his credibility that he was unable  to  fully  recall  that
             address and required prompting.


        81.       Whilst I have reminded myself  that  the  core  issue  is
             whether the appellant has  been  living  continuously  in  the
             United Kingdom for 20 years and not, for example,  whether  he
             has been living in Sheffield  or  at  different  addresses  in
             Sheffield; nor is this memory  test  either,  nevertheless,  I
             have decided that I must place significant adverse  weight  on
             the unsure and hesitant nature of this evidence  and  also  on
             the fact that the Appellant had  not  previously  disclosed  a
             truthful and accurate history of where he had been  living  or
             with whom and finally that his evidence is highly inconsistent
             with his brothers evidence.


        82.       Taking all of this into  consideration,  I  have  decided
             that I cannot be sure, even on the  balance  of  probabilities
             where the Appellant has been living and with whom some of  the
             period under scrutiny.


        83.       Further support for this finding  can  be  found  in  the
             Appellants medical records where Mr Mullarkey pointed out that
             there is a very large gap of time  from  23/04/2007  when  the
             Appellant failed to attend  an  appointment  until  05/07/2013
             when the next entry occurs.  This was put to the Appellant  by
             Mr Mullarkey.  He said that he could not make himself ill.  He
             was feeling fine and well that period.  I  find  that  is  not
             reasonably likely that the Appellant would not  need  to  seek
             medical help of any kind for over six years.


        84.       Mr Mullarkey submitted that this was  evidence  that  the
             Appellant had left the United Kingdom for a  period.  Ms  Khan
             submitted that this be very difficult given that  he  did  not
             have any travel documents. Whilst there is  some  strength  in
             both those competing submissions, the fact  remains  that  the
             Appellant has failed to substantiate on the evidence  provided
             when viewed in  the  round,  that  he  has  been  continuously
             present in the United Kingdom for over 20 years at the date of
             the hearing.


    15.  The  Judge  took  into  account  evidence  provided  by  witnesses
        including the appellants brother and it was for the Judge to  place
        weight upon that evidence as seen fit. In relation to the brother's
        evidence the Judge finds that at best it supports  a  finding  that
        the appellant had been seen at his brother's  business  at  regular
        intervals between 2007 and the present day. Even if it is  accepted
        the appellant has been in the UK during that time,  this  does  not
        mean the appellant can succeed under the Immigration Rule as with a
        date of entry of 4 December 1988 and the human  rights  application
        of 23rd September 2018 the requisite 20-year period  had  not  been
        acquired. This is accepted by the appellant in Ground 1.
    16. In relation to the litigation debt issue, it is not  disputed  that
        at  the  date  of  the  First-tier  hearing  that  debt  was  still
        outstanding. The original debt was �1020 of  which  �300  had  been
        paid. Ms Khan advised the Upper Tribunal that the balance  had  now
        been paid in full but that  is  clearly  something  which  occurred
        after the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal. Date  of  payment
        was confirmed by Mr McVeety as 3 December 2019.
    17. This is a human rights appeal in which the Judge  was  required  to
        adopt a structured approach as per the Razgar guidance.  The  Judge
        finds the appellant has a private life in the United Kingdom  which
        will include ties  formed  as  a  result  of  length  of  time  the
        appellant has lived here. The date at  which  matters  relevant  to
        article 8 are considered is the date of the hearing. Taking matters
        at their highest, by 11 September 2019 the appellant  had  acquired
        the necessary 20 years residence in United Kingdom, but this is not
        a case which required the Judge to give  weight  to  the  fact  the
        appellant met the requirements of the Immigration Rules as  at  the
        relevant time, date of application, as he did not.
    18. Whilst the evidence does appear to support a finding  that  by  the
        date of decision, and correspondingly at the date  of  the  hearing
        before the Upper Tribunal, the appellant had acquired the necessary
        20 years continuous  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom,  that  is
        arguably more relevant to his ability to  succeed  if  he  makes  a
        fresh application in which the date of that application becomes the
        relevant date rather than in relation to whether at the date of the
        application leading to the decision under  challenge  the  20  year
        period had been made out, which it had not. No legal error material
        to the Judge's conclusion that the relevant  period  had  not  been
        made out under the Immigration Rules or the weight the  Judge  gave
        to that  fact  as  part  of  the  article  8  assessment  has  been
        established.
    19. The grounds also state the Judge failed to make a clear finding  on
        the suitability requirements of the Immigration Rules, specifically
        S-LTR4.4, when refusal under S-LTR is discretionary. It is  correct
        that no specific findings are made on the implication of that,  but
        even  if  the  weight  given  to  the   litigation   debt   element
        theoretically resulted in a finding that  matter  should  not  have
        been held against the appellant in relation to the Rules, that will
        still not enable the appellant to succeed meaning such omission  is
        not material. The decision of 2 May 2019 was made  because  it  was
        stated by the respondent:


           a) The Appellant does not meet the suitability in S  -  LTR  and
              paragraph 276 ADE(1)(i) because he fails to meet  S-LTR  4.4.
              It is noted that he has litigation debt outstanding of  �1020
              under Invoice number LR/35418/A.
           b) Further, the First Appellant fails to satisfy the  provisions
              of paragraph 276 ADE(1)(iii)(iv) and (v) the rules in respect
              his private life.
           c) In relation to paragraph 276ADE (1)(vi) it is not accept that
              there would be very significant obstacles to his  integration
              into Turkey if the  Appellant  were  required  to  leave  the
              United Kingdom because he resided in Turkey up to the age  of
              21 years which includes his childhood, formative years and  a
              portion of his adult life. He has demonstrated his ability to
              adapt to life in another  country  during  his  stay  in  the
              United Kingdom. You can use the same ability when he  returns
              to Turkey, a country which he is already familiar with....


    20. Other reasons within the refusal letter are noted by the  Judge  at
        [13], but I accept Mr  McVeety's  submission  that  had  the  Judge
        considered the discretionary nature of  S-LTR  the  decision  would
        clearly have been the same on the evidence and sustainable facts as
        found, namely that the appellant had not established an entitlement
        to succeed under the Immigration  Rule  in  any  event.  The  error
        identified in ground 2 is therefore not material.
    21. The Judge must have accepted the appellant's claim relating to  the
        nature of his private life as indicated by [107].  The  nature  and
        quality of the private  life  is  not  necessarily  dependent  upon
        whether the appellant has established  20  years  as  the  evidence
        relied upon by the appellant and others reflects what the appellant
        claims in that regard. It is  not  made  out  that  any  issues  in
        relation to the period the appellant was reporting or in which  the
        Judge seems to have thought he was out of the UK, when he was  not,
        had a material impact upon the merits of the Article  8  aspect  of
        the appeal; especially as it has not been made out  the  nature  of
        the private life claimed would have been any  different  from  that
        the appellant claimed which appears to have been  accepted  by  the
        Judge.
    22. The question  in  relation  to  article  8  ECHR  was  whether  the
        interference  with  that  private  life  is  proportionate  to  the
        legitimate aim relied upon by the respondent.
    23. The Judge note the private life had been formed during the time the
        appellant was in the United Kingdom unlawfully, and  that  pursuant
        to section 117B of the 2002 Act it was appropriate to apply  little
        weight to such private life. This is not challenged in the grounds,
        per se. Having weighed up the competing interests the  Judge  finds
        at [112]: "Based on all the  same  fact  is  found  above  and  the
        conclusions drawn above, I find that there  is  nothing  about  the
        Appellant's circumstances which means that the public interest  can
        be outweighed in this case. They do not  amount  to  insurmountable
        obstacles or exceptional circumstances for reasons already set out.
        The removal of the Appellant would not lead to unjustifiably  harsh
        consequences for him for reasons fully set out above".
    24. The fact the appellant has now paid the litigation debt, meaning he
        may not now fall foul of  the  suitability  requirements  (although
        this will have to be  assessed  by  the  official  considering  any
        further application) and in light of his ability  to  establish  20
        years continuous residence in the United  Kingdom  in  any  further
        application, there is support for  the  appellant  making  a  fresh
        application  under  the  long   residence   requirements   of   the
        Immigration Rules.
    25. I do not find it  made  out,  however,  that  the  finding  in  the
        decision under challenge,  namely  that  the  appellant  could  not
        succeed under the Rules and in light of that  and  other  findings,
        that  the  decision  is  a  proportionate  interference  with   the
        appellant's private life,  falls  outside  the  range  of  findings
        reasonably open to the Judge on the evidence. It is a  decision  in
        line with the evidence and applicable law.


Decision

    26. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.


    27. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


I make no  such  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
