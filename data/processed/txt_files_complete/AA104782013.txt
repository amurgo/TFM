                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The appellant appeals against a determination by First-tier Tribunal
       Judge D C Clapham SSC, promulgated on 28 February 2014.


    2. Judge Clapham reached his decision following a hearing at which  the
       appellant did not appear.  He proceeded  with  the  hearing  in  the
       light of her  unexplained  absence  and  of  her  solicitors  having
       withdrawn due to lack of instructions.


    3. On the information available to Judge Clapham, the procedure adopted
       and the resulting determination are impeccable.  However, unknown to
       the Judge and to the respondent when the hearing took  place  on  21
       February 2014, the appellant was committed to a mental hospital  due
       to first episode psychosis from 19 February to 31 March 2014.

    4. Through no fault of the First-tier Tribunal, circumstances have  now
       been disclosed arisen which constructively amount  to  legal  error.
       The respondent agreed that the appropriate course was to  set  aside
       the determination and proceed to another hearing.

    5. No  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  are  to  stand.   Under
       s.12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and Practice Statement 7.2 the  nature
       and extent of judicial fact finding necessary for the decision to be
       remade is such that it is appropriate to remit the case to the First-
       tier Tribunal.  The member(s) of the First-tier Tribunal  chosen  to
       reconsider the case are not to include Judge D C Clapham SSC.
