Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr G Davison, Counsel, instructed by Regal Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a  national  of  Zimbabwe,  date  of  birth  [  ]  1983,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated 11 February 2014,  to
    refuse to issue a derivative residence card as the primary carer  of  a
    British national resident in the  United  Kingdom,  with  reference  to
    Regulations  15A(4A),  15A(7)(b)  and  18A(1)(b)  of  the   Immigration
    (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  as  amended  (the   2006
    Regulations).

2.    The  requirements  of  Regulation  15A(4A)  are  as  follows.   It  is
    necessary that

    (a)  the applicant is the primary carer  of  a  British  national  (the
         relevant British citizen);


    (b)  the relevant British citizen is residing in the UK; and


    (c)  the relevant British citizen would be  unable  to  reside  in  the
         United Kingdom or  in  another  EEA  State  if  the  applicant  was
         required to leave.

    Under Regulation 15A paragraph (7)(b) the applicant must  be  a  person
    who has primary responsibility for that British citizen's care  or  who
    shares equally the responsibility for the  relevant  British  citizen's
    care.  The Secretary of State must issue a  person  with  a  derivative
    residence card on application and  on  production  of  proof  that  the
    applicant has a derivative right of residence under Regulation  15A  of
    the 2006 Rules.  The issue taken in the Reasons for Refusal Letter  was
    that the Appellant's evidence was insufficient,  her  criminal  history
    showed that she was undesirable with reference to paragraph  322(5)  of
    the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) and that  the  Appellant  had
    failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she  was  the
    primary carer of a relevant British citizen, namely her daughter P-RD.

3.   The Appellant's appeal against that  decision  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Kaler, the (judge) who on 6 November 2014 dismissed  the
    appeal under the 2006 Regulations and also with reference to Article  8
    ECHR.

4.   Permission to appeal against that decision was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge J M Holmes and that was  opposed  by  the  Secretary  of
    State in a Rule 24 response dated 15 January 2015.

5.   On 25 November 2015 I promulgated a decision in which I found that  the
    Original Tribunal had made an error of law failing to properly  analyse
    the material under Regulations 15A and 18A, not least with reference to
    the case of Zambrano (C-34/09).  I also made an anonymity order because
    of the age of P-RD (date of birth 19 June 2012 and a British national).

6.   I gave directions for the further hearing.

7.   The Presenting Officer and I were provided  with  a  copy  letter  from
    Regal Law Solicitors to the father of P-RD, Mr JMD, dated  17  December
    2015.  The solicitors wrote asking if JMD intended to take  any  active
    in the upbringing of P-RD  bearing  in  mind  the  absence  of  contact
    previously and secondly whether he wished to take an active role in the
    future in her life and if the  Appellant  was  required  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom whether he would play a pivotal role in bringing up P-RD
    in the United Kingdom.  There was no  reply  to  that  letter.   On  27
    January 2016 Regal Law Solicitors again wrote to JMD referring to their
    letter of 17 December 2015 and noting the absence  of  a  response  and
    asking for confirmation as to his position in relation  to  P-RD.   The
    Appellant confirmed that the address in Forest Gate to  which  JMD  was
    written was the correct address.

8.   It is of course to be noted that at the hearing before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Kaler the Appellant appeared but JMD did not and made no
    representations in writing as  to  the  issues  arising  let  alone  in
    respect of his interest in or willingness to  take  responsibility  for
    the care of P-RD in the future.

9.   The position therefore was that the Appellant has the burden  of  proof
    of showing upon a balance of probabilities that she was the sole  carer
    for P-RD and that there was no-one to whom P-RD  could  be  handed  for
    care and upbringing were the Appellant  to  have  to  remove  from  the
    United Kingdom.

10.  The  Appellant  gave  evidence  in  which  she  confirmed  her  witness
    statement previously made and indicated that JMD was, as  a  result  of
    CSA action, paying the minimum basic maintenance figure of 15%  of  his
    gross earnings which was ï¿½390 per month for  the  child's  maintenance.
    There is according to the Appellant no  communication  between  herself
    and JMD since those CSA arrangements have  been  made  and  no  contact
    would be obtained through the CSA unless it was  necessary  to  make  a
    change in maintenance payment. In which case the CSA would make  direct
    contact with JMD and then he would communicate with  CSA  and  the  CSA
    would communicate with the Appellant.

11.  The thrust of the  cross-examination  in  challenging  the  Appellant's
    evidence, pursued by Ms Isherwood, was essentially that  the  Appellant
    and JMD were in fact in a relationship which was a happy one,  that  he
    was taking a part in the upbringing of P-RD,  he had provided a copy of
    his passport particulars to the Appellant to enable P-RD  to  obtain  a
    passport and the absence of his presence or any correspondence  or  any
    direct evidence from him supporting the Appellant's claim was  no  more
    or less  than a manifestation of them both pursuing courses designed to
    mislead and to  misrepresent  the  nature  of  their  relationship  and
    conceal the presence of JMD in the care of P-RD.  Ms Isherwood  in  her
    submissions  relied  upon  the  absence  of  direct  reference  to  the
    Appellant by name in documents produced by the NHS Trust  or  from  the
    health visitor or from the nursery school P-RD attended  simply  was  a
    manifestation of the fact that there was nothing to indicate  that  she
    was the sole carer of P-RD.

12.  In addition it was said that absence of evidence from third parties  as
    to her being the sole carer was also indicative of the  fact  that  JMD
    and the Appellant were bringing up P-RD together.

13.  Given that the Appellant's daughter  was  being  looked  after  on  the
    hearing date by an aunt who was covering the school hours it seemed  to
    me that there would have been sense in those who know  the  Appellant's
    situation to have written letters of support even if it might  be  said
    that they  were  self-serving.   Nevertheless  the  Appellant  candidly
    accepted that she had not been asked to obtain such letters, she relied
    upon her representatives nor had  her  family  been  asked  to  produce
    statements or a statement relating to the sole  care  provided  by  the
    Appellant  to  P-RD.   The  Appellant  said  that  the   NHS   and   GP
    correspondence was not addressed personally because that was the nature
    of the way they communicated.  The Appellant indicated that she was the
    registered parent for the child and that if the  child  was,  as  might
    have been inferred in the custody of JMD, he would have  been  the  one
    who registered her with his GP.  The  Appellant  confirmed  that  there
    were discussions at some stage but JMD indicated he was to ready to  be
    a father wanted no contact.

14.  In addition the Appellant said that she had tried to have contact  with
    JMD concerning the new school that P-RD will go to  in  September  2016
    and invited him to go and visit the school but  so  far  as  anyone  is
    aware that invitation was not taken up.  The Appellant  said  that  she
    had left messages on JMD's phone and sent text messages to which  there
    had been no reply.  The Appellant had not brought such documentation of
    the messages and texts and telephone bills to the hearing but  did  not
    do so because no-one had suggested  that  she  should.   The  Appellant
    rejected that there was agreement with JMD that he would care for  P-RD
    and the Appellant opined that P-RD would have to  be  cared  for  by  a
    third party, e.g. Social Services, who had no bond with  her,  who  was
    not a parent or relation and that she did not think that  can  possibly
    be in the best interests of her child.

15.   It  appeared  from  the  Appellant's  evidence  that   JMD's   family,
    potentially a grandparent of P-RD, took no interest and  maintained  no
    contact with her. It  was  not  known  if  P-RD's  grandmother  on  the
    father's side was even alive.  The Appellant said that  although  there
    was a time towards the end of December 2012 when JMD  had  had  contact
    with P-RD he had ultimately decided that he could  not  manage  such  a
    relationship with the Appellant or the child and accordingly apart from
    making the CSA payments that was effectively the end of contact.

16.  Issue was taken by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kaler  as  to  whether  at
    that time the Appellant had been entirely truthful as to the extent  of
    contact between her and JMD.  It seemed to me that  that  was  a  point
    where there may have been reluctance to  enlarge  upon  the  extent  of
    contact at that time but ultimately there is  nothing  to  gainsay  the
    evidence, other than doubt, or  the  absence  of  contact  between  the
    Appellant and JMD or JMD and P-RD.

17.  I remind myself that the burden of proof is upon the Appellant to  show
    on a balance of probability that the  evidence  is  reliable  that  she
    gives concerning her being the sole carer for P-RD.

18.  The Appellant admitted  that  she  entered  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    visitor and overstayed.  The Appellant admitted that she had wanted  to
    become a nurse and therefore applied for leave to remain as  a  student
    which was refused.  The Appellant used false documentation to undergo a
    training course as a nurse and she also obtained a bursary to which she
    was not entitled but which appears to have been an integral part of the
    application to become a  student  nurse.   The  Appellant  admitted  to
    obtaining false documents to enable her to work.

19.  The same deception of false documents ultimately formed the  basis  for
    matters on which she was convicted before Snaresbrook Crown Court on 25
    September  2009  and  sentenced  to  imprisonment.   As  Ms   Isherwood
    trenchantly put it, the Appellant had lied and lied again on a  variety
    of different matters.  The Appellant says that that is correct although
    they were really interrelated matters associated with her long wish  to
    be a nurse and she denied  any  further  use  of  deception.   She  was
    subject to disciplinary proceedings by the NMC (Nursing  and  Midwifery
    Council).  The Appellant in 2011 pursued a  claim  seeking  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection which was found to be with no substance and  an
    adverse view was taken of her conduct in the misrepresentation she  had
    made about her status in obtaining false documentation.

20.  The Appellant's registration as a registered nurse was suspended on  25
    March 2011 following a substantive hearing and was made for a period of
    twelve months with review and extension on 25 March 2012 for a  further
    twelve months.  Prior to the expiry of the order a review  hearing  was
    held by the NMC and it is clear from the Record of Proceedings that the
    panel was aware of the conviction and the issues raised,  namely  false
    accounting, using a false instrument, two  counts  of  obtaining  money
    transfers by deception, possessing a false identity  document  and  two
    counts of processing an article for use  in  fraud.   For  each  matter
    there was a sentence of eighteen months imposed  concurrently  but  the
    sentence  was  reduced  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  twelve  months'
    imprisonment on each count.  It was accepted that for the  purposes  of
    the criminal law at the date of conviction the Appellant  was  of  good
    character.  The panel noted that the Appellant

         "... took full responsibility and acknowledged  your  mistakes  and
         accepted that it would be 'a lifetime of regret' for you.  You told
         the panel that because of these decisions you may never be able  to
         practise again and you had accepted this.  However, you stated that
         when you considered fitness to practise you  related  it  to  one's
         inability to safe nursing practice.  You told the panel that  there
         had been no issues with your clinical practice in the past  and  in
         that regard, you told the panel your fitness to  practise  was  not
         impaired.  You told the panel that you had a lot to  offer  because
         you enjoy nursing and you give 100% from  the  heart.   You  stated
         that you want and hope to practise and  cannot  imagine  not  being
         able to."

21.  The NMC panel was of course looking at this as stated in terms  of  the
    protection of patients, the protection  of  public  confidence  in  the
    nursing profession and the upholding and declaring of proper  standards
    of conduct and performance in respect of which  dishonesty  is  a  very
    serious  matter  which   strikes   at   the   root   of   patient-nurse
    relationships.  The NMC panel accepted that the  Appellant  had  during
    the period of suspension gained insight into her past conduct, and  had
    displayed a high amount of remorse for her  actions.   The  panel  also
    noted  and  were  impressed  by  the  Appellant's  maintenance  of  her
    qualifications  through  CPD  and  she  was  returned  to  unrestricted
    practice, they  being  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  had  taken  all
    available steps to rehabilitate herself and  keep  up  her  skills  and
    nursing knowledge. Notwithstanding those serious matters of  dishonesty
    the NMC panel considered that the standing of the NMC  as  a  regulator
    would not be undermined.

22.  My impression at the hearing, having  heard  the  Appellant's  evidence
    and how she responded to cross-examination, was that the Appellant  had
    insight into why her criminality was wrong and that she was telling the
    truth about her daughter and the  role,  as  sole  carer,  she  has  in
    bringing her up.  I appreciate that it would have been helpful if other
    witnesses had been called who knew the Appellant and daughter and could
    speak to their knowledge of that household.  I note Ms Isherwood's line
    of attack upon the evidence but it seemed to me that if  the  Appellant
    and JMD are in a happy relationship, as Ms Isherwood  submitted,  there
    was really no point in them both pursuing a story  littered  with  lies
    when she could simply make a spousal application under the  Rules.   If
    they were happily together whilst the route to  remain  under  the  EEA
    Regulations 2006 might have failed on the issue the fact of the  matter
    was that there would have  been  another  basis  to  remain  under  the
    immigration rules.

23.  Equally if JMD had made a statement essentially saying that  the  child
    was solely in the care of the Appellant the Respondent could well reply
    that such a response as that was simply self-serving to show  that  the
    Appellant was  the  sole  carer  and  therefore  should  be  dismissed.
    Similarly the absence of statement from  JMD  was  either  confirmation
    that they were in a happy relationship or dismissed as self-serving  to
    support the claim to remain.  Looking at  the  evidence  in  the  round
    therefore the argument of Ms Isherwood also identifies that if JMD  had
    appeared to give evidence as to his lack of interest that  was  because
    they were happily together or that they were both seeking to mislead as
    to their true personal circumstances as  joint-carers of P-RD.  If  JMD
    had appeared at the hearing and said he was  taking  no  interest  that
    would simply be dismissed as self-serving in or/and part of the general
    exercise in deception to enable the Appellant to remain under the  2006
    Regulations.

24.  I formed the view on all the evidence in the round that if  the  burden
    of proof had been to the  criminal  standard  this  appeal  would  have
    failed through the lack  of  a  third  parties  giving  statements  and
    additional evidence but I find on the lower standard of  proof  on  the
    balance of probabilities that  the  Appellant  has  shown  it  is  more
    probable than not that the Appellant was the sole carer for P-RD.   The
    appeal should be  allowed  under  Regulations  15A(4A),  15A(7)(b)  and
    18A(1)(b) of the 2006 Regulations.

25.  In the light of the case law  of  Amirteymour  [2015]  UKUT  466  (IAC)
    there is no need to consider that issue of Article 8 ECHR  since  there
    are no removal directions  and  there  is  no  Section  120  notice  in
    existence.
NOTICE OF DECISION
The original Tribunal's decision cannot stand.  The  following  decision  is
substituted.  The appeal is allowed.
ANONYMITY ORDER
The anonymity order previously made is continued.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In this case the appeal has succeeded through the need  for  a  hearing  and
the evidence provided for those purposes.  In the circumstances it does  not
seem to me that it would be appropriate to make  a  fee  award  against  the
Respondent.
