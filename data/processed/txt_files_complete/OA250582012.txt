Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr N Nason, Solicitor from Luqmani Thompson &
Partners



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Entry Clearance  Officer,  Kingston  appeals  with  permission  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Russell who for reasons given  in
    a determination dated 28 January 2014 allowed the  respondent's  appeal
    on human rights grounds under Article 8  against  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's decision dated 27 November 2012 refusing entry  clearance  to
    the respondent as the partner of a British national, Mrs  McCarty  with
    reference to the relevant provisions of Appendix FM of the  Immigration
    Rules.

 2. The respondent is a citizen of Granada born 24 August 1977.  He married
    Mrs McCarty on 14 February 2009 and on 7 October that year was  granted
    entry clearance to come to the United Kingdom as her  spouse.   He  was
    granted leave to remain until 7 January 2012.  The respondent  and  his
    wife believed on a misreading of the dates that had been entered by the
    New York post that he had leave to remain until 1  July  2012.   On  10
    March 2012 the respondent left the  United  Kingdom  for  his  mother's
    funeral.  On attempting to return to the United Kingdom he was informed
    that his leave to enter had expired and thus the fresh application  for
    entry clearance which was submitted online on 19 September 2012.

 3. That application was refused because of the failure by the sponsor, Mrs
    McCarty to demonstrate she had a gross income of at least  �18,600  per
    annum as defined in E-ECP.3.3.1.  Her gross income from her  employment
    with Hayes Staff Recruitment was �12,701.04 per annum.  No evidence  of
    savings had been provided and accordingly the application was  refused.
    In a review by the Entry Clearance Manager it  was  observed  that  the
    respondent last worked in the United Kingdom over one  year  previously
    and had also worked in breach of the conditions of his  visa  and  thus
    that previous income could not be taken into account.

 4. The judge  found  the  respondent  had  not  demonstrated  he  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.   He  reached  a  more  positive
    conclusion however under Article 8 after directing himself in  relation
    to the most recent authorities on the correct  approach  to  Article  8
    under the new Rules including Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules -  correct
    approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) and The Queen (on the  application  of)
    Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin).

 5. The judge found the respondent had family life with  Mrs  McCarty.   He
    also found that she had a troubled medical  history  which  required  a
    "not inconsiderable need of medical attention" owing to  her  diagnoses
    of Conn Syndrome including a requirement for careful  management.   The
    judge considered that the  interference  was  sufficiently  serious  to
    engage the operation of Article 8.  The judge  concluded  that  it  was
    hard to see what the legitimate aim was although he  acknowledged  this
    to be one of maintaining effective immigration control.  He  considered
    the respondent had demonstrated he did  not  need  recourse  to  public
    funds and further noted that the respondent had  been  present  in  the
    United Kingdom and engaged in obtaining qualifications  and  work.   In
    short,  he  considered  the   denial   of   entry   clearance   to   be
    disproportionate to the aim to be achieved.

 6. The grounds of challenge are as follows:

      a) The judge's conclusion that the fact that the respondent would have
         qualified under the old Rules was irrelevant and should not enhance
         the claim under Article 8;

      b) The judge's conclusion that the sponsor's health may be set back by
         the refusal did  not  appear  to  be  supported  by  any  objective
         evidence; the instant appeal was far  removed  from  the  instances
         where  the  protection  of  an  individual's  moral  and   physical
         integrity is engaged;

      c) As to the reliance by the judge on MM and Others v SSHD [2013] EWHC
         1900 (Admin) it was submitted that  the  judge  in  that  case  had
         wrongly assumed the role of the democratically accountable decision
         maker in the formulation of policy and had insufficient  regard  to
         the width of discretion afforded  to  the  Secretary  of  State  in
         formulating that policy;

      d) Relying on MM as  a  fundamental  element  of  the  proportionality
         assessment had been material misdirection;

      e) The judge had failed to apply the income threshold in its Article 8
         assessment;

      f) The income threshold ensured that those  who  choose  to  establish
         their family life in the UK should have the  financial  ability  to
         support themselves and  to  be  able  to  support  their  partner's
         integration into British society.  It was  therefore  inappropriate
         the  judge  should  decide  to  disregard  those  points   in   its
         proportionality assessment.

 7. Mr Walker explained that the decision in MM had been  appealed  to  the
    Court of Appeal and he accepted that he would  be  in  difficulties  if
    that appeal were not successful.  Mr Nason explained that  the  judge's
    decision to allow the appeal did not stand and fall on MM  only  having
    regard to the reasons given by the judge.

 8. Mr Walker candidly accepted that the grounds were not clear as  to  the
    argument advanced and observed that the  grounds  were  a  disagreement
    with the findings that  had  been  made.   Mr  Nason  referred  to  the
    objective  evidence  of  Mrs  McCarty's  medical  position  at  various
    locations in the bundle which included medical records, records of  her
    mental health and general evidence regarding her syndrome.   Mr  Walker
    accepted that the ground at (b) was erroneous  with  reference  to  the
    analysis by the judge of the impact of Mrs McCarty's medical  condition
    as observed by the judge at [39] and [40] of his decision.  He  further
    accepted that the challenge at (a) in the grounds did not  reflect  the
    approach taken by the judge  in  his  findings  under  Article  8.   He
    similarly accepted the grounds were similarly misconceived at (c), (e),
    as well as difficulty with the  argument  at  (f).   He  concluded  his
    submissions with the candid acknowledgement that the  findings  by  the
    judge were  clear  on  all  aspects  and  that  family  life  had  been
    established.

 9. I consider Mr Walker was correct to take the position he did in respect
    of the grounds.  I am satisfied  that  the  judge  reached  conclusions
    rationally open to him on the evidence, correctly directed  himself  to
    the law and reached a  permissible  conclusion  on  Article  8  grounds
    without material error.



10. Accordingly the appeal by the Secretary of State to the Upper  Tribunal
    is dismissed and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.






Signed                                  Date 12 June 2014
