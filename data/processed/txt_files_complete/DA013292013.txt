                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Ms Daykin, instructed by Blavo & Co Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. For the purposes of this decision I refer to PO as the appellant  and  to
the Secretary of State as the respondent,  reflecting  their  positions  as
they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

           2. In a decision dated 26 September  2013,  First-tier  Tribunal
              Judge P Rowlands and Mr D R Bremner allowed  the  appellant's
              appeal  against  automatic  deportation  on  Article  8  ECHR
              grounds.

Error of Law

           3. The respondent's challenge to that decision has merit.

           4. It is well-rehearsed law within this jurisdiction that in an
              automatic deportation case when assessing an individual's
              Article 8 rights, proper weight must be given to the public
              interest in deportation. Prior to the UK Borders Act 2007,
              the Court of Appeal in a series of cases beginning most
              prominently with N (Kenya) v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 1094 set
              out the facets of the public interest that had to be weighed
              in a deportation appeal. The facets of the public interest
              were summarised by Wilson LJ (as he then was) in OH (Serbia)
              v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 694 at [15] in the following terms:

         "(a) The risk of reoffending is one facet of  the  public  interest
         but, in the case of very serious crimes,  not  the  most  important
         fact.


         (b)  Another important facet is the need to deter foreign nationals
         from committing serious crimes by leading them to understand  that,
         whatever the other circumstances, one consequence of them may  well
         be deportation.


         (c)  A further important facet is the role of a  deportation  order
         as an expression of society's revulsion at serious  crimes  and  in
         building public confidence in the treatment of foreign citizens who
         have committed serious crimes.


         (d)  Primary responsibility for the public interest, whose view  of
         it is likely to be  wider  and  better  informed  than  that  of  a
         tribunal, resides in the  respondent  and  accordingly  a  tribunal
         hearing an appeal against a decision  to  deport  should  not  only
         consider for itself all the  facets  of  the  public  interest  but
         should weigh, as a linked but independent feature, the approach  to
         them adopted by the respondent in the context of the facts  of  the
         case."

           5. The subsequent case law of the Court of  Appeal  makes  plain
              that the public policy  factors  identified  in  OH  (Serbia)
              continue to apply in automatic deportation cases.   One  such
              case is RU (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 651  in  which
              at  [40],  Aikens  LJ  reiterated  that  the  policy  factors
              identified in OH (Serbia) continued  to  apply  in  automatic
              deportation proceedings.  He said this:

    "40. At all events on an appeal from the SSHD's decision  that  section
    32(5) applies in a case where the 'foreign criminal'  has  argued  that
    removal pursuant an automatic  deportation  order  would  infringe  his
    Article 8(1) rights and be  disproportionate,  the  tribunal  or  court
    concerned must recognise and give due weight to all the  public  policy
    factors identified in OH (Serbia).  It must acknowledge that  the  SSHD
    is entitled, indeed obliged, to give due weight to them.  The  tribunal
    or court must also acknowledge and give due weight to them when drawing
    the 'proportionality balance' under Article 8(2)."

           6. Also, in Rocky Gurung v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 62, Sir  Stephen
              Sedley, delivering the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal,
              agreed with the submission that had been made by both Counsel
              in RU and by both Counsel in Rocky  Gurung  that,  first  the
              public interest factors summarised in  OH  (Serbia)  were  no
              less important in  automatic  deportation  appeals;  secondly
              that  the  effect  of  s.32(4)  of  the  2007  Act  made  "no
              difference in practice" in  assessing  proportionality  under
              Art 8.2; and thirdly, a Tribunal was  required  to  consider,
              for itself, the "content and extent" of the  public  interest
              having regard to the public interest factors summarised in OH
              (Serbia).

           7. The importance of the public interest being afforded
              appropriate weight also features in more recent Court of
              Appeal decisions, for example, in SS (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2013]
              EWCA Civ 550, which states at [54]:

    "The pressing nature of the public interest here is vividly informed by
    the fact that by Parliament's express declaration the public interest
    is injured if the criminal's deportation is not effected. Such a result
    could in my judgement only be justified by a very strong claim indeed."




           8. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 119 at [40] the  Court
              of Appeal accepted the respondent's  submission  set  out  in
              [39] that, such is the weight to be afforded  to  the  public
              interest:

    "It is only exceptionally that such foreign criminals will  succeed  in
    showing that their rights under article 8(1) trump the public  interest
    in their deportation."

           9. In AM (Turkey) v SSHD [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1634  the  Court  of
              Appeal indicated at [31]:

    "While the landscape for qualification for deportation has  changed  in
    consequence of the 2007 Act by the creation of "automatic  deportation"
    of "foreign criminals", it seems to me, in agreement with Aikens LJ  in
    RU (Bangladesh) and Sir Stephen Sedley in Gurung,  inevitable  that  in
    measuring proportionality  the  public  interest  in  deterrence  is  a
    material  and  necessary  consideration.  The  public  interest  is  an
    important  component  of  the  balancing  exercise  required  to   test
    proportionality (for the purpose of section 33(2)(a))  whether  or  not
    the Secretary of State expressly says so in her decision letter  or  in
    the presenting officer's submissions to a tribunal. It is an  indelible
    feature of the balancing exercise that the decision  maker  weighs  the
    consequences of deportation against the full import of  the  legitimate
    aim to be achieved. Mr Saeed, with some skill, sought to  persuade  the
    court that we could infer from the express language  used  by  the  FTT
    that it had well in mind the public interest which the  domestic  cases
    identify. I accept that this court should not readily conclude  that  a
    specialist tribunal erred in law but also "that it is for the  Tribunal
    to demonstrate that it has applied the correct test when striking  that
    balance" (per Pill LJ in OH (Serbia) at paragraphs  27  and  32).  With
    some regret I must conclude that no such inference  is  available.  The
    only expression of the  legitimate  aim  which  appears  in  the  FTT's
    determination (see paragraph 27  above)  is  that  which  Article  8(2)
    expressly identifies. The emphasis in the FTT's self-direction  of  law
    is upon the harsh consequences of separating a family which may  follow
    an immigration decision. It drew  no  distinction  between  the  public
    interest considerations arising in immigration decisions (to which Lord
    Bingham was referring in Razgar and EB  (Kosovo))  and  in  deportation
    decisions following the commission of serious  crime.  As  Richards  LJ
    held in JO (Uganda) different considerations apply when the balance  is
    to be struck against a separate and more powerful public interest.  For
    this reason I am unable to conclude that the FTT did have in mind  both
    the  existence  and  the  breadth  of  the  legitimate  aim  which  the
    deportation order was pursuing.."

          10. Like the Court of Appeal in AM, I am  reluctant  to  conclude
              that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law but I am unable  to
              identify that it properly identified or  weighed  the  public
              interest in this appeal. There is formal reference to it only
              as part of the rehearsal of the standard questions set out in
              Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 [2004] INLR  349  at  [16].  Ms  Dayton
              pointed out that it was also referred  to  in  the  anonymity
              direction at [27]. The latter appeared to me to be  referring
              to an entirely different aspect of  the  public  interest  in
              deportation cases.

          11. I did not accept that those references or any other  part  of
              the determination showed a proper understanding  or  weighing
              of the public interest in this appeal. There  is  nothing  in
              the determination that shows that the various aspects of  the
              public interest from OH (Serbia)  were  considered.  I  found
              that to be a material error of law.

          12. Further, as identified by Mr Saunders, this case really turns
              on the accepted family life between  the  appellant  and  his
              young  son.  Where  there  is  that  family  life,  the  best
              interests of the child  fall  to  be  weighed  as  a  primary
              factor. This is also  a  well-rehearsed  principle  beginning
              with ZH (Tanzania) (FC) the Secretary of State for  the  Home
              Department [2011] UKSC  4,  through  MK  (best  interests  of
              child) India [2011] UKUT 00475 (IAC) and SS (Nigeria).

          13. At [22(ix)] the First-tier Tribunal  refers to:

    " ... the problems the son has over the Appellant being in custody  and
    away from him. We believe that in taking into  account  the  Appellants
    offending behaviour the best interests and well-being of his  son  does
    include contact with the Appellant."

          14. At [23] it states:

    "We have considered the best interests of the child as we are  required
    to do and on the face of it he has, apart from the time that he was  in
    prison, spent all of his life with his father and  would  realise  that
    his father was no longer present."

          15. And at [25]:

    "We  believe  that  deportation  of  this  Appellant  would  result  in
    separation of him from his son and  that,  in  all  the  circumstances,
    would be disproportionate. We do not consider notwithstanding  what  we
    have said about the circumstances of the offence that it is seriousness
    (sic) to justify the separation of father and child."


          16. That assessment  of  the  child's  best  interests  does  not
              include any reference to the fact of the child being able  to
              remain in the UK with his mother whether or not the appellant
              is deported. It was not disputed before me that the mother is
              the primary carer of the child. The assessment is made on the
              limited evidence of the appellant concerning the difficulties
              his child had whilst he is  in  prison  which  has  left  him
              anxious about his father going away again. The Tribunal  does
              not take into account at any point that  the  evidence  about
              the child provided by the appellant was not supported by  the
              mother of the child from whom there was no evidence  at  all,
              on the child's best interests or  anything  else.  There  was
              also no social work  report  or  evidence  from  the  child's
              school that might have provided  objective  and  professional
              evidence on the child's difficulties were the appellant to be
              deported.

          17. Where  the  evidence  about  the  child  and  best  interests
              assessment is limited, it is not possible from  the  decision
              of the First-tier Tribunal to establish what it was about the
              best interests of this child,  even  taking  the  appellant's
              evidence at its highest, that could outweigh what is  rightly
              identified as a "particularly abhorrent" criminal offence and
              the strong public interest in deporting this  appellant  that
              arises therefrom. I also  found  the  approach  to  the  best
              interests of the appellant's child amounted to an error on  a
              point of law.

          18. Both these errors led me to find that  the  decision  of  the
              First-tier Tribunal  had to be set aside and re-made.

Preliminary Issues

          19. Ms Dayton submitted that the appeal should be remitted to the
              First-tier Tribunal because of the fact-finding exercise that
              would have to be conducted and in the alternative that any re-
              making should be  adjourned  in  order  for  the  appellant's
              partner to attend to give evidence.

          20. I was not with Ms Dayton on either of her  applications.  The
              Senior President's Practice Statement dated 25 September 2012
              states at paragraph 7.2 that it "is likely"  that  the  Upper
              Tribunal will "proceed to  re-make  a  decision,  instead  of
              remitting the case to the First-tier Tribunal."  It  did  not
              appear to me that there was much, if  any  "fact-finding"  in
              the re-making of this appeal, the dispute between the parties
              really being about the weight to be afforded to the generally
              accepted competing factors in the Article  8  proportionality
              assessment.

          21. Secondly, the direction for  the  hearing  before  me  stated
              clearly that the parties should  prepare  for  any  remaking,
              providing any further evidence, including supplementary  oral
              evidence  to  be  considered  "at  that   hearing   (original
              emphasis)". I noted that  the  appellant's  partner  did  not
              attend or provide any evidence for  the  First-tier  Tribunal
              hearing.  There  is  still  no  witness  statement  or  other
              evidence from her. There was nothing from her to explain  her
              absence or  willingness  to  attend  a  future  hearing.  The
              appellant maintained that she could not  attend  the  hearing
              due to child-care issues but it was not clear to me how  that
              could be so given the importance of the hearing to the future
              of the family.

          22. I determined that the appeal should be re-made in  the  Upper
              Tribunal and that an adjournment was not necessary  in  order
              for the appeal to be determined fairly and justly.

My Decision

          23. In order for the appellant to succeed under the provisions of
              the Immigration Rules on the basis of his  relationship  with
              his son, I must decide whether he can meet  the  requirements
              of paragraph 399 (a) (ii) (b) which states that there must be
              "no other family member who is able to care for the child  in
              the UK." The appellant cannot succeed on this  basis  as  the
              child's mother is here, albeit in  an  uncertain  immigration
              status, there being no  suggestion  that  her  departure  was
              imminent

          24. The First-tier Tribunal found at [16] that the appellant  may
              have a relationship with the mother of his child but that the
              evidence does not show this to be a family life in  terms  of
              Article 8. Even were it shown to be "a genuine and subsisting
              relationship" it is not one that can meet the requirements of
              paragraph 399 (b) given the  partner's  lack  of  immigration
              status and her Nigerian nationality indicating that  she  can
              be expected to return to Nigeria with the appellant.

          25. It was not suggested that the appellant can meet the  private
              life  requirements  set  out  in  paragraph   399A   of   the
              Immigration Rules.

          26. Where the appellant cannot meet the requirements of paragraph
              399 or 399A  I  must  go  on  to  assess  whether  there  are
              "exceptional circumstances" that outweigh the public interest
              in deportation. This is set out in MF at [44], thus:

    "We would, therefore, hold that the new rules are a complete  code  and
    that the exceptional circumstances to be considered  in  the  balancing
    exercise involve the application of a proportionality test as  required
    by the Strasbourg jurisprudence."

          27. At [43] the Court of  Appeal  in  MF  described  "exceptional
              circumstances" thus:

    "The word "exceptional" is often used to  denote  a  departure  from  a
    general rule. The general rule in the present context is that,  in  the
    case of a foreign prisoner to whom paras 399 and  399A  do  not  apply,
    very compelling  reasons  will  be  required  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deportation. These compelling reasons are the  "exceptional
    circumstances".

          28. That guidance  must  be  considered  in  the  proportionality
              assessment together with the jurisprudence set out  above  on
              the weight that attracts  to  the  public  interest  in  this
              matter.

          29.  The  advocates   before   me   made   submissions   on   the
              proportionality  of  the  decision  as  none  of  the   other
              intermediate questions set down  in  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27
              [2004] INLR 349 are in dispute.


          30. I set out my proportionality  assessment  in  line  with  the
              guidance provided in Boultif v Switzerland 2001  ECHR  54273,
              as confirmed by Uner v the Netherlands 2007 Imm  AR  303,  in
              which the European Court of Human Rights said that  in  order
              to assess whether an expulsion measure  was  necessary  in  a
              democratic society and proportionate to  the  legitimate  aim
              pursued, the following criteria had to be considered:


          (i) The nature and the seriousness of the offence committed by the
              Appellant;
          (ii)     The length of the Appellant's stay in the country from
             which he or she was to be expelled;
          (iii)    The time that had elapsed since the offence was committed
      and the               claimant's conduct during that period.
          (iv)  The nationalities of the various parties concerned;
          (v) The Appellant's family situation, such as length of marriage
      and other        factors expressing the effectiveness of the
      Appellant's family life;
          (vi)     Whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time he
             or she entered into the family relationship;
          (vii)    Whether there are children in the marriage and if so
      their ages;
          (viii)   The seriousness and the difficulties which the Spouse is
      likely to             encounter in the country of the Appellant's
      origin;
          (ix)     The best interests and well being of any children of the
             Appellant; and in particular the seriousness of any
             difficulties that they would be likely to encounter in the
             country to which the Appellant would be expelled;
          (x)      The solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the
      host country and          with the country of destination.


          31. The appellant was convicted on 31 May 2012 of theft and
              sentenced to 20 months imprisonment and ordered to pay
              compensation of �12,520. The sentencing remarks were as
              follows:

         "... the offence for which I must sentence you is one of the
    utmost seriousness. I've got to deal with you for a single charge to
    which you've pleaded guilty, of the theft of �12,520 from a lady who
    was on any view an extremely vulnerable victim. Mary Fanshaw is an
    elderly lady, she is a lady with disabilities in terms of learning
    difficulties and also mental health problems which makes it necessary
    for her to live in supported complex accommodation which she does in
    Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire. She lives there and is assisted by a
    number of care workers of whom at the material time you were one and
    because of her various difficulties in order to get money from her bank
    account or debit card is left available to be used by her at her
    request in charge of the care workers responsible for the supported
    complex in which she lives, you are one of those people that had direct
    access to her debit card. She is a lady who plainly relies very heavily
    on those who are there to help though she lives in a sense
    independently, you've known her for quite some time and indeed it is
    clear that you had known her at a previous home at which you worked and
    that which she was a resident before she moved to the accommodation we
    are concerned with in this case, and it's plain that you were her
    favourite and treated by her as her favourite, no doubt you ingratiated
    yourself with her to the extent of being able to acquire from her
    information which would have included the pin number used in
    conjunction with the debit card to get access to the money that she had
    in her account and what happened over a period of thirteen months was
    that you made no less than forty-seven separate withdrawals from that
    woman's bank account using the card and using, no doubt, the pin number
    that you had obtained for use in conjunction with it and the total
    amount of money of �12,520 effectively drained her account to the point
    that when other members of staff went to draw money out they realised
    that there was very little money in that account, it had all gone into
    your pocket...
    ...
    The starting point in those circumstances is one of two years custody
    and when I look at the aggravating features which are spelt out in the
    guidelines, one of the aggravating features I'm required to take into
    account is the long course of offending, well thirteen months and 47
    withdrawals speaks for itself in terms of a long course of offending
    and any more vulnerable victim than the unfortunate Ms Fanshaw it would
    then be very hard to imagine. It seems to me that not only does this
    cross the custody threshold but it crosses it by a mile and it would be
    a dereliction of duty reposed in me by the public for me to regard this
    as a matter that deserved anything less than a substantial term of
    imprisonment, and that is a sentence that I'm going to impose upon you.


    ...
    I must give you a discount for your plea of guilty. The discount would
    be greater if you had chosen to admit that matter from the beginning,
    but when you are questioned by the police about this you made no
    comment and it wasn't until you got caught and realised how hopeless
    your position was that you entered the guilty plea you did.
    ...
    The mitigation advanced on your behalf is your ill health, the fact
    that you have a child and are partly responsible for the child, that
    you have the intention of paying the money back by realising a property
    you have inherited the country from which you came and are in the
    process of trying to sell. It may well be that is all perfectly true,
    but I don't see why the fact that you are in the course of realising
    that property to get money from it should necessarily be a reason not
    to give you the sentence which in my judgement you richly deserve.
    Having regard to the mitigation and not least your good character it
    seems to me I can properly, taking it together with your plea of
    guilty, reduce the starting point I have mentioned by a full third but
    that still means that the least sentence that I can impose upon you is
    one of twenty months imprisonment, and that is the sentence of this
    court."

          32. It is clear from the sentencing remarks that the  appellant's
              offence must be weighed extremely  heavily  against  him,  it
              being "one of the utmost seriousness".

          33. Some weight in the appellant's favour  must  arise  from  his
              having paid, in two instalments, beginning in September 2013,
              �40 of the compensation of �12,520 owed to  his  victim.  The
              sums involved show that the weight for the appellant  thereby
              must be rather small, however.

          34. Ms Dayton submitted that if the appellant leaves the UK,  the
              compensation order ends and thereby the obligation  to  repay
              his victim. She suggested that is something  that  benefitted
              the appellant in the proportionality assessment as it had  to
              be in the public interest for compensation  to  be  paid.  It
              must most certainly be greatly preferable for this  appellant
              to follow through on his evidence that he wishes to live free
              from the guilt of this crime and pay back his victim in  full
              wherever he may be. The fact that at  present,  well  over  a
              year after the compensation order, he has not  been  able  to
              raise capital from a property he owns in Nigeria and has only
              paid back �40 does not suggest to me that the victim  or  the
              public  interest  is  likely  to  benefit  greatly  from  his
              continued presence in the UK.

          35. I accept that other  than  this  offence,  the  appellant  is
              generally of good character and I place little weight on  his
              driving offence from 2004, that being a historical and  minor
              matter.

          36. I also accept that the Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) dated 23 May
              2012  identified  the  appellant  as  at  a   low   risk   of
              reoffending. I noted that it suggested a  suspended  sentence
              in order to protect the appellant's housing  and  ability  to
              care for his child upon release. It remains the case, as  the
              sentencing judge made very clear, that a  custodial  sentence
              was the only appropriate sentence in this matter.

          37. I also accepted that the OASys Assessment dated 2 August 2013
              also identified the appellant as being a low risk of any harm
              to others and at low risk of reoffending.

          38. Risk of reoffending, however,  is  only  one  aspect  of  the
              public interest in deportation as identified in the case  law
              set out above. There remains the factors of deterrence and of
              expression of public revulsion at the offence. It appeared to
              me that both of these factors had to  weigh  heavily  against
              the appellant, particularly  so  given  the  very  vulnerable
              nature of his victim and extended period over which  he  took
              advantage of her.

          39. Turning to the other Boultif criteria that have  purchase  in
              this case, the appellant has been in the UK for a substantial
              period of time, 12 years, and has been here lawfully  all  of
              that time. There is  no  doubt  that  he  has  established  a
              private life here, one of substance given the length  of  his
              residence, his working life and the concomitant links that he
              will have formed in  the  community.  These  matters  clearly
              weigh in his favour.

          40. I accept, subject to my comments on  the  compensation  order
              above, that  the appellant's conduct since his conviction has
              been positive. He has not reoffended. I was  shown  a  letter
              dated 14 August 2013 from HMP  Brixton  confirming  his  good
              conduct there which included attending courses, being put  in
              trusted  positions  and  training  as  a  Listener  for   the
              Samaritans.

          41. I accepted the findings of the First-tier Tribunal  that  the
              appellant that that the appellant has a relationship with his
              partner but cannot place a great deal of weight on  it  where
              there is really very little of substance explaining its depth
              and seriousness. Any assertions by  the  appellant  on  those
              matters have to be weighed against the non-appearance of  the
              partner at two hearings and absence of any evidence from  her
              in support of his Article 8 claim. There is also  the  matter
              that the  appellant's  partner  appears  to  have  been  here
              unlawfully at all times and neither  she  nor  the  appellant
              have approached the authorities in that regard.

          42. As above, it is the appellant's 3 year old son and  his  best
              interests that lie at the heart  of  this  assessment.  I  am
              turning to this factor in the order set down by  Boultif  but
              this does not in any way reflect my approach to it  as  being
              anything other than a primary factor, and  one  that  in  the
              final balancing  of  all  the  competing  interests  must  be
              considered first.

          43. As above, there is limited evidence before me about the child
              and his best interests. The appellant maintains that his  son
              suffered emotionally whilst he was in prison and continues to
              exhibit anxiety  when  the  appellant  is  not  present.  The
              appellant believes that his son will be very damaged if he is
              deported.

          44. I accept that the appellant and his  son  have  the  expected
              strong and important relationship between a father and child.
              They have lived together since the child was born other  than
              when the appellant was in prison. The records from the prison
              show that the appellant's son visited him regularly and  they
              appear to be living  together  again  now.  I  also  noted  a
              comment in the letter dated to  September  2013  from  Sylvia
              Nteleza at  page  34  of  the  appellant's  bundle  that  the
              appellant's son had become withdrawn whilst he was in  prison
              and had stopped eating properly, the child being  very  close
              to his father.

          45. Where the future of this  child  is  at  stake,  I  found  it
              appropriate to weigh the evidence that I have  about  him  at
              its highest. It can only but be a very serious matter  for  a
              small child if the father with whom he has grown-up and  with
              whom he has formed a close  bond  is  deported.  It  was  not
              suggested that there is any question  of  the  British  child
              accompanying the appellant to  Nigeria.  I  accept  that  the
              child will be significantly damaged in the  short  and  long-
              term if his father returns to Nigeria and cannot come to  the
              UK to see him for what is likely to be at least 10  years  if
              not a longer period. More than that I cannot find as  regards
              the child's best interests,  however,  given  the  limits  of
              evidence placed before me.

          46. I also noted the three letters from friends confirming he  is
              good character and links to the community. I accept  that  it
              weighs in favour of the appellant that he has worked  in  the
              past rather than relying on benefits and is actively  seeking
              to do so again. The appellant is  not  dispute  that  he  has
              close family members in Nigeria, however. On his own evidence
              he has significant assets there by way of family property.

          47. The appellant is understandably apprehensive as he  has  been
              diagnosed with diabetes which has led to an operation  for  a
              cataract on one eye and he is waiting for a second  operation
              on his left eye. He takes insulin and  manages  his  diet  in
              order to treat this disease.  This  is  a  common  condition,
              however, and not one for which it can seriously be  suggested
              that there is no treatment available in Nigeria. It  is  also
              difficult to see how the appellant can seek to have weight in
              his favour on the basis of medical provision in Nigeria given
              that the PSR indicates that one of the reasons he stole  from
              his disabled victim was to pay for medical treatment which he
              chose to seek in Nigeria rather than in the UK.



Conclusion

          48. Having set out my view on the relevant and competing  factors
              in this matter, I must come down on one side of the balance.

          49. In the final analysis, it was my view that the seriousness of
              the appellant's offending behaviour and weight that  must  be
              placed  on  the   public   interest   side   outweighed   the
              interference to the appellant's family and private life.  Put
              simply, I did not find there to be "very compelling  reasons"
              or that this was "a very  strong  claim  indeed"  even  after
              assessing the best interests of the child and the damage  the
              absence  of  his  father  will  do  to  that  child  and  the
              appellant's relatively long and  lawful  residence  at  their
              highest.   I  found  that  the  respondent's   decision   was
              proportionate.

Decision

          50. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an
              error on a point of law and is set aside.

          51. I re-make the appeal as refused.


Anonymity

I make an anonymity order under Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008, precluding publication of  any  information  regarding
the proceedings which would be likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
identify the appellant, his partner or his child.   I  do  so  in  the  best
interests of the child in order to protect his identity.
