                 REASONS FOR FINDING A MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on  25  October  1989.  He
    appeals against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  O'Hagan
    sitting at Birmingham on 23 January 2019 in which the  Judge  dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal against a decision of the Respondent  dated  6th
    of November 2018. That decision was to refuse the Appellant's claim for
    asylum and humanitarian protection and to refuse him leave to remain on
    human rights grounds.

 2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2011  with  a
    valid student visa (extended to 12 August 2013). He has  remained  here
    since then without leave. An application for further student  leave  on
    12 August 2013 was refused on 30 July 2015 after it was concluded  that
    the TOEIC certificate submitted in support of the application had  been
    obtained by deception. On 24 June 2014 the decision was made to  remove
    the Appellant from the United Kingdom. That decision was  withdrawn  on
    15 July 2015 because the Appellant had absconded. The Appellant claimed
    asylum on 6 March 2018 the refusal of  which  has  given  rise  to  the
    present proceedings.

The Appellant's Case

 3. The Appellant's case was that his father, who died when  the  Appellant
    was young, and his mother were members of the LTTE. In May 2010 the Sri
    Lankan authorities came  to  the  home  of  the  Appellant's  aunt  and
    demanded the telephone number of the Appellant's mother. Two days later
    they returned and arrested the Appellant. The  Appellant  was  detained
    for five days during which he was questioned and  ill-treated.  He  was
    released after his mother paid a bribe to secure his release.

 4. In January 2015 his mother returned to Sri  Lanka  to  investigate  the
    situation following a change of government  but  was  arrested  at  the
    airport and subsequently  sentenced  to  seven  years  in  prison.  The
    Appellant relied on a medical report from a Clinical  Psychologist,  Dr
    Rozmin  Halari   which   diagnosed   post-traumatic   stress   disorder
    precipitated by the Appellant's traumatic experiences. He  also  relied
    on correspondence  from  a  Sri  Lankan  attorney  Mr  S  Somapala  who
    confirmed the existence of an arrest warrant and the  incarceration  of
    the Appellant's mother. The Respondent did not accept  the  Appellant's
    account of his mother's involvement with the LTTE because it  was  said
    to be vague and lacking in detail and there was no supporting  evidence
    for it.

The Decision at First Instance

 5. At the outset of the hearing and before  commencing  the  evidence  the
    Judge had a discussion with the advocates about how best to enable  the
    Appellant to give his evidence given the vulnerabilities outlined in  a
    psychologist report. It was agreed that questions should be put  simply
    and clearly. There was a need for a non-confrontational  approach.  The
    Judge was satisfied with the way the Presenting Officer cross  examined
    the Appellant, see [13] of the determination.

 6. The Judge also raised at the outset his concern that the expert had not
    seen the Appellant's medical records before preparing the psychological
    assessment report and that  would  need  to  be  addressed  in  closing
    submissions. The Appellant's solicitors had  attempted  to  obtain  his
    medical records, but they were not received until 22 January  2019  the
    day before the hearing and  five  days  after  the  report  itself  was
    prepared. The  Judge  accepted  the  Appellant's  explanation  why  the
    Appellant had employed a proxy test taker in relation  to  his  English
    language test, see  [37].  The  Judge  noted  that  Doctor  Halari  was
    qualified  to  express  his  opinions  and  had  conducted  a  clinical
    interview with the Appellant and  had  made  appropriate  observations.
    This ordinarily would have led the Judge to conclude that the resulting
    report was reliable but there were significant countervailing  factors.
    Doctor Halari had not had sight of  the  Appellant's  medical  records.
    Whilst Doctor Halari could only consider what was available to him was,
    it was nevertheless the case that he had failed to acknowledge that the
    medical records were not before him or to consider the deficit  in  his
    knowledge that arose as a result.

 7. The Judge gave an example of what problems the absence of  the  medical
    records had led to, noting that at paragraph 25 of  his  report  Doctor
    Halari had said the Appellant had no  medical  problems  prior  to  the
    claimed trauma. There  was  a  gap  of  over  8  ï¿½  years  between  the
    Appellant's claimed detention and mistreatment  in  May  2010  and  the
    psychological assessment by Doctor  Halari  in  January  2019.  It  was
    reasonable  to  suppose  that  Doctor  Halari  should  have  asked  the
    Appellant how the Appellant had managed in the intervening  period  but
    there was no indication that Doctor Halari had considered that point at
    all. At no time since  his  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom  had  the
    Appellant sought any medical support. The Appellant's  engagement  with
    medical services was not consistent with the clinical picture presented
    by Doctor Halari and as a result the report carried substantially  less
    weight than might otherwise have been the case.

 8. Whilst there were factors that suggested that the letter written by Sri
    Lankan lawyers and attachments were documents on which  reliance  could
    be placed there were countervailing factors.  The  letter  was  not  on
    headed notepaper but had the appearance of having been  simply  printed
    off. More significantly was that the lawyers had destroyed  their  file
    of papers following the hearing at which  the  Appellant's  mother  was
    said to have received a substantial prison sentence. As a  result,  the
    Judge treated the Sri Lankan lawyers' letter  with  more  caution  than
    would otherwise have been the case. There were other credibility issues
    partly to do with delay. The Judge  struggled  to  understand  why  the
    Appellant had waited for a period  of  about  6  months  between  being
    released from custody in May 2010 and applying for leave to come to the
    United Kingdom as a student on 29 November 2010. The Appellant had  not
    attempted to claim asylum until March 2018 seven years after  he  first
    came to the United Kingdom. The return of the Appellant's mother to Sri
    Lanka was an absurdly risky thing for her to do. It lacked  credibility
    that she would simply return despite the obvious risk to which she  was
    exposing herself.

 9. The Judge noted that Doctor Halari had expressed the  view  that  there
    would be a very real risk of suicide  but  the  weight  that  could  be
    attached to the report was reduced by reason of the absence of  the  GP
    records. The Judge did not accept that there was a risk of suicide  and
    he dismissed the appeal.

The Onward Appeal

10. The Appellant's grounds of appeal made six points. The first  was  that
    there was nothing in the determination which suggested that the  detail
    of the Appellant's detention had been considered by the Judge. The  2nd
    point took issue with the reduced weight the Judge had  placed  on  the
    report of Doctor Halari. It was not necessary or compulsory for  either
    psychologists or psychiatrists to have access  to  GP  medical  records
    when making assessments. The psychologist was aware of the gap  between
    the Appellant's detention and the date of  his  assessment.  There  had
    been a lengthy face-to-face meeting with the Appellant and  the  report
    was  Istanbul  protocol  compliant.  The  Appellant's  medical  records
    demonstrated the Appellant been referred for therapy.  The  Appellant's
    symptoms had worsened after his mother's  detention  and  he  struggled
    immensely in discussing these matters owing to the shame he  felt.  The
    3rd ground argued the Judge had erred in  respect  of  the  documentary
    evidence relying on the Court of Appeal authority of PJ [2014] EWCA Civ
    1011. Weight  should  have  been  attached  to  the  lawyer  to  lawyer
    correspondence.

11. The 4th ground refer to other  errors  in  the  Judge's  assessment  of
    credibility and the 5th ground complained that the Judge  had  rejected
    the Appellant's health claim owing to a  faulty  assessment  of  Doctor
    Halari's report. The Judge had failed to consider and apply the country
    guidance in relation to health claims. The 6th ground argued the  Judge
    had rejected the claim under the immigration rules  paragraph  276  ADE
    (vi) on the basis that the asylum  claim  was  rejected  but  this  was
    erroneous.

12. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to  appeal  because  it  was
    arguable that the Judge had failed: (i) to accord  distinct  weight  to
    Doctor Halari's report and should have  taken  into  consideration  the
    doctor's  finding  that  the  Appellant   had   been   suffering   from
    psychological symptoms which fortified the Appellant's account  of  his
    experiences and had failed: (ii) to accord weight to the arrest warrant
    having said that the letter and arrest warrant were documents on  which
    reliance might be placed.

The Hearing Before Me

13. For the Appellant counsel relied upon the detailed  grounds  of  onward
    appeal and argued that the Judge had erred in assessing the Appellant's
    credibility in the light of the detail the Appellant had provided.  The
    GP records (not before Doctor Halari) had referred to  the  Appellant's
    need for therapy. It was not clear what weight the Judge placed on  the
    correspondence with the Sri Lankan lawyer. Due to the  arrest  warrant,
    the Appellant came within the GJ risk factors as he was likely to be on
    a stop list. No efforts, counsel informed me, had apparently been  made
    by the Appellant's solicitors to ask the Sri Lankan lawyer why  he  had
    destroyed his papers.

14. For the Respondent, the Presenting Officer indicated he agreed with the
    grant of permission to appeal. In relation to the credibility  findings
    of the Judge for example the mother's circumstances and  the  issue  of
    her mobile phone number, there were other explanations which the  Judge
    had not taken into account. Whilst another Judge might  still  find  as
    this Judge had, there were material errors in the determination.

Findings

15. The difficulty the Judge had in this case was that the two  key  pieces
    of evidence the Appellant was relying upon had come into existence  two
    months after the refusal letter had  been  written.  The  hearing  took
    place on 23 January 2019. The medical report of Doctor H  was  prepared
    on 17 January. The correspondence with the Sri Lankan lawyer included a
    certificate from the magistrates' court that the document produced  was
    a true copy of the warrant of arrest.  The  certificate  was  dated  11
    January 2019, 12 days before the hearing.  The  Appellant's  solicitors
    had only written to the Sri Lankan lawyer on 20 December 2018. Two  key
    pieces of evidence were thus filed and served very  much  at  the  last
    minute.

16. The Judge was concerned at the omission from Doctor Halari's report  of
    the Appellant's GP records which might or might  not  indicate  whether
    the Appellant had a long history of psychiatric problems since being in
    the United Kingdom or whether they might have come into existence after
    the  refusal  letter.  The  Sri  Lankan  lawyer's   documentation   was
    distinctly unusual because the Sri Lankan lawyer had destroyed his file
    of papers. The Judge considered that that  was  significant  enough  to
    mean that he could not place weight on what would otherwise  have  been
    very important evidence. The Respondent does not consider  that  either
    of the objections which the  Judge  made  to  the  two  key  pieces  of
    evidence were free from material errors of law.

17. The appeal before  me  thus  raised  two  questions.  Firstly,  if  the
    determination was a set aside and the appeal reheard, were there likely
    to be any other sustainable  challenges  (beyond  what  the  Judge  had
    found) to either Doctor Halari's report  or  the  Sri  Lankan  lawyers'
    correspondence? Secondly, if there were no other sustainable challenges
    and the Respondent was not prepared to accept a decision in his  favour
    in the terms of the determination on those two pieces of evidence,  was
    there another course of action other than allowing the appeal outright?



18. My concern is the late filing of  crucial  evidence  in  this  case  in
    circumstances where  that  evidence  was  incomplete.  Doctor  Halari's
    report was incomplete because he had not seen the GP records. I do  not
    accept the argument that because other doctors in other  situations  do
    not see GP records, there was no need for Doctor Halari to see  the  GP
    records in this case. In my  view  they  were  crucial  and  if  Doctor
    Halari's report was to be admitted the doctor should have been  invited
    to write a supplemental report evaluating the GP records and what  they
    meant in terms of his overall conclusions.

19. In relation to the Sri Lankan lawyers' evidence, because this was filed
    and served so late in the day, the Respondent had no opportunity to use
    his  offices  in  Sri  Lanka  to  check  whether  this   documentation,
    particularly,  the  arrest  warrant  was  or  was  not   genuine.   The
    Respondent's position in this appeal is somewhat muddled and I have  to
    say I was not assisted by the submissions of the Presenting Officer. As
    the Respondent is not prepared to stand by  the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal it is difficult to uphold it and I therefore set it
    aside. I am not however prepared at this  stage  to  allow  the  appeal
    outright because of the gaps in the  evidence  which  I  have  outlined
    above.

20. I remit this appeal back to the First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  heard  de
    novo. I expect that in the meantime Doctor Halari will  be  invited  to
    prepare a supplementary report in the light of the GP records  and  the
    Respondent will  decide  whether  to  investigate  the  arrest  warrant
    produced  by  the  Appellant.  The  Respondent  should  obviously  have
    completed his enquiries by the time of the rehearing. If the Respondent
    does not feel able to challenge either or both of these two  pieces  of
    evidence he may wish to give consideration to withdrawing his decision.
    It will be open  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at  the  re-hearing  to
    evaluate for itself the significance or otherwise of the allegation  of
    a proxy test taker.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside. I direct that the appeal  be  remitted  to  the
First-tier Tribunal to be re-heard

Appellant's appeal allowed to that limited extent

I continue the anonymity order made by the First-tier Tribunal.
