                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a decision and reasons by First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Foulkes-Jones promulgated on 1st July 2015 in which  she  allowed
    an appeal, on Article  8  grounds,  against  a  decision  made  by  the
    Secretary of State to refuse an application for leave to remain in  the
    UK on the basis of a family life as a  partner  under  the  immigration
    rules.

 2. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the
    respondent to this appeal is [DF].  However for ease of  reference,  in
    the course of this decision I shall adopt the parties' status as it was
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  I shall in  this  decision,  refer  to
    [DF] as the appellant, and the Secretary of State as the respondent.

Background

 3. The appellant, an Albanian national entered the UK 17th September  2013
    with entry clearance valid until 11th August 2014.  There was an  issue
    before the Judge as to whether the appellant was granted leave to enter
    as a student or a student visitor but, in any event, on 15th July  2014
    she applied for leave to remain in the UK on the basis  of  her  family
    life as a partner and on Article 8 grounds.

 4. The respondent refused the application for leave to remain  in  the  UK
    under the immigration rules and concluded that there are no exceptional
    circumstances, which consistent with the right to respect  for  private
    and family life contained in Article 8 ECHR, warrant the grant of leave
    to remain outside the immigration rules.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Foulkes-Jones

 5. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Foulkes-Jones  heard  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant and her partner, [AP].

 6. The findings and conclusions of First-tier Tribunal Judge Foulkes-Jones
    are set out at section [5] to her decision.  Having carefully  examined
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules, the Judge found at paragraph
    [5(19)] that the appellant has not provided specified evidence from the
    sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP 3.2 of a specified annual income  of
    at least �18,600 and therefore, the  Appellant  does  not  meet  E-LTRP
    3.1(a)(i).  Having  reached  that  conclusion  the  Judge  went  on  to
    consider whether  the  appellant  met  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    EX.1.(b). For the reasons that appear at paragraphs [5(22)] to [5(27)],
    the Judge found:

         "28. On  the  evidence  before  me  I  find  that  there  would  be
         difficulties for [AP] to relocate with the Appellant to Albania but
         I do not find that there would  be  very  significant  difficulties
         which could not be overcome or would involve very serious  hardship
         on the evidence before me.

         29.  Having regard to what I say above I  dismiss  the  Appellant's
         appeal under paragraph EX.l(b) of the Immigration Rules."

 7. Having dismissed the appeal under the immigration rules, the Judge went
    on to consider whether the appeal could succeed on Article  8  grounds.
    She reminded herself of the five questions identified by  Lord  Bingham
    in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  She found that there is family life  between
    the Appellant and [AP] and that the  appellant's  removal  will  be  an
    interference by a public authority with the exercise of the applicant's
    right to respect for her family life.  She found that the  interference
    will have consequences of such gravity as  to  potentially  engage  the
    operation of Article 8, and that such  interference  is  in  accordance
    with the law and is necessary  for  the  economic  well  being  of  the
    country and for the maintenance of  proper  immigration  control.   The
    Judge then considered whether the interference is proportionate to  the
    legitimate public end sought  to  be  achieved.   She  found,  for  the
    reasons set out at paragraphs [32(v)] to [32(xiii)]  of  her  decision,
    that the Respondent's decision  is  disproportionate  to  the  need  to
    maintain effective immigration control.

The Grounds of Appeal

 8. The respondent claims  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Foulkes-Jones
    erred in law in her approach to Article 8.  First, the judge failed  to
    give reasons or adequate reasons on a material matter.  The  respondent
    submits that  having  found  that  the  appellant  cannot  satisfy  the
    requirements of the immigration rules, and having found, in particular,
    that there are no "insurmountable obstacles" to the family life between
    the appellant and her partner continuing outside the UK, the Judge  has
    failed to adequately explain why  the  appeal  succeeds  on  Article  8
    grounds.  The respondent relies in particular upon the judgement of  Mr
    Justice Sales in Nagre -v- SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 in which he stated,  at
    [43]

         "... the gap between the test for leave to remain under EX.1(b) and
         the result one would arrive at by direct consideration of Article 8
         in the precarious family life class of case is likely to be  small.
         In the majority of such cases, if the applicant for leave to remain
         cannot show that there are insurmountable obstacles  to  relocation
         of a spouse or partner to his or her country of  origin  so  as  to
         meet that part of the test laid down in EX.1(b), they will  not  be
         able to show that their removal is disproportionate."

 9. Second, the Judge misdirected herself in law as to the relevance of the
    inability to meet the financial requirements set out in the immigration
    rules.  The  Judge  expressly  found  that  the  appellant's  sponsor's
    savings do not meet  the  evidential  requirements  in  Appendix  FMSE.
    However, at paragraph [5(32)(xi)], the Judge  takes  into  account  the
    income and savings of the sponsor in reaching her decision to allow the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds.  The respondent relies in particular  upon
    the judgement of Richards LJ, in SS (Congo) & Others  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    387 in which he stated:

         "51. In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light of the
         Rules in Appendix FM-SE should  the  same  as  in  respect  of  the
         substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM. In other  words,  the
         same general position applies, that compelling circumstances  would
         have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or LTR where  the  evidence
         Rules are not complied with.

         52.  This is for two principal reasons. First, the  evidence  rules
         have the same general objective as the substantive rules, namely to
         limit the risk that someone is admitted into the United Kingdom and
         then becomes a burden on public resources,  and  the  Secretary  of
         State has the same primary function in relation to them, to  assess
         the risk and put in place measures which  are  judged  suitable  to
         contain it within acceptable bounds. Similar weight should be given
         to her assessment of what the  public  interest  requires  in  both
         contexts.

         53.  Secondly, enforcement  of  the  evidence  rules  ensures  that
         everyone applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally and  fairly  in
         relation to the evidential requirements they must satisfy. As  well
         as keeping the costs of administration  within  reasonable  bounds,
         application of standard rules is an important means  of  minimising
         the risk of arbitrary differences in  treatment  of  cases  arising
         across the wide range of  officials,  tribunals  and  courts  which
         administer the system of immigration controls. In this regard,  the
         evidence Rules (like the substantive Rules) serve as a safeguard in
         relation to rights of applicants and family members  under  Article
         14 to equal treatment within the scope of  Article  8:  compare  AJ
         (Angola), above, at [40], and Huang above, at [16] ('There will, in
         almost any case, be certain general considerations to bear in mind:
         the general administrative desirability of applying known rules  if
         a system of immigration control is  to  be  workable,  predictable,
         consistent and fair as  between  one  applicant  and  another;  the
         damage to good administration and effective control if a system  is
         perceived  by  applicants  internationally  to  be  unduly  porous,
         unpredictable or perfunctory;...  the  need  to  discourage  fraud,
         deception and deliberate breaches of the law; and so on ... ". Good
         reason would need to  be  shown  why  a  particular  applicant  was
         entitled to more preferential treatment with  respect  to  evidence
         than other applicants would expect  to  receive  under  the  Rules.
         Moreover, in relation to the proper administration  of  immigration
         controls, weight should also be given to the Secretary  of  State's
         assessment of the evidential requirements needed to  ensure  prompt
         and fair application of  the  substantive  Rules:  compare  Stec  v
         United Kingdom, cited at para. [15] above. Again, if  an  applicant
         says that they should be given  more  preferential  treatment  with
         respect  to  evidence  than  the  Rules   allow   for,   and   more
         individualised consideration of their case, good reason  should  be
         put forward to justify that."

10. Third, the respondent submits that the Judge misdirected herself as  to
    the relevance of the decision in Chikwamba, because the appellant  does
    not meet the substantive requirements of  the  immigration  rules,  and
    thus the appellant has not been refused leave to remain simply  on  the
    procedural ground that the appellant should return to Albania and  make
    an application from there.  The respondent relies upon the judgement of
    Mr Justice Nicol in Thakral -v- SSHD [2015] UKUT 00096 (IAC).

11. Permission to appeal was granted on 22nd September 2015  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Andrew.  In so doing, she stated:

         "2.  It is arguable that the Judge having failed to explain why the
         matter succeeds under Article 8 outside the Rules given her finding
         that there are no insurmountable obstacles as  a  result  of  which
         Paragraph EX1 is not met. Further, it is arguable  that  the  Judge
         should not  have  taken  into  account  the  Appellant's  husband's
         savings, which cannot  meet  the  evidential  requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules when  coming  to  her  decision  in  relation  to
         Article 8.  However, having carefully considered Paragraph 31(v) of
         the decision I  am  satisfied  that  the  Judge  did  not  rely  on
         Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40."

12. Although the respondent advances three grounds of appeal, permission to
    appeal has only been granted in respect of the first two grounds that I
    have identified at paragraphs 8 and 9 above.  Having  myself  read  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, Judge Andrew was right  to  refuse
    permission on the third ground for the reason set out by her.

13. The statutory jurisdiction of the Upper Tribunal is firstly, to  decide
    whether the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved
    the making of an error of law: s12(1) Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
    Act 2007.  If the Upper Tribunal finds that there was such an error  of
    law, it may set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  and  if
    it does so, either remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal or re-make
    the decision.  The matter now comes before me to  consider  whether  or
    not the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  a
    material error of law, and if the decision is set aside, to re-make the
    decision.

The hearing before me on 9th November 2015

14. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Fijiwala adopted the grounds of appeal.
     She submits that having  decided  that  the  appellant  is  unable  to
    satisfy the requirements of the immigration rules, the Judge  erred  in
    her approach to the assessment of the Article 8 claim.   She  draws  my
    attention to the decision of the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo) -v- SSHD
    [2015] EWCA Civ 387 in which the Court considered the  proper  approach
    to applications for leave to enter the UK outside the Immigration Rules
    on the basis of Article 8.  She submits that in a case  such  as  this,
    where the Judge held that there are no insurmountable obstacles to  the
    family life between the appellant and her  partner  continuing  outside
    the UK for the purposes of  the  immigration  rules,  that  finding  is
    highly relevant to the Judges assessment of Article 8 claim because the
    gap between section EX.1 and the requirements of Article 8 is likely to
    be small.  She draws my attention to  the  decision  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Agyarko -v- SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 440.

15. Miss Fijiwala submits  that  whilst  the  Judge  has  referred  to  the
    relevant authorities in  her  decision,  she  has  not  considered  the
    relevant guidance provided by the Court of Appeal.   She  submits  that
    there is no reason why  the  appellant  should  be  treated  with  some
    preference, when it is clear that she cannot meet the  requirements  of
    the immigration rules.  She submits that having found that there are no
    insurmountable obstacles to the family life between the  appellant  and
    her  partner  continuing  outside  the  UK,  it  is  perverse,   absent
    exceptional circumstances, to find that the removal of the appellant is
    disproportionate to the need to maintain effective immigration control.

16. In reply, Mr Bonavero submits that the decision of the Court of  Appeal
    in SS (Congo) is referred to at paragraph [30] of the Judge's  decision
    and reasons, and in reaching her decision the Judge  plainly  had  that
    decision in mind.  He submits that the first ground of appeal  advanced
    is misconceived.  He submits  that  in  order  for  the  respondent  to
    succeed in her 'reasons' challenge, she would need to demonstrate  that
    it is impossible to understand the reasons for which  the  Judge  found
    that the appellant's removal would amount to a disproportionate  breach
    of her Article 8 rights. He draws my attention to the decision  of  the
    Court of Appeal in R (Iran) & Ors -v- SSHD [2005]  EWCA  Civ  982.   He
    submits that it is perfectly clear why the Judge reached  the  decision
    that she did.  It was by reference to a range of factors including  the
    appellant's  pregnancy,  her  previous   miscarriage,   the   financial
    resources of her partner, and the fact that her child will be a British
    Citizen.

17. As to the second  ground  of  appeal,  Mr  Bonavero  submits  that  the
    approach proffered by the respondent is  strange  and  artificial.   He
    submits that a proportionality exercise necessarily involves looking at
    all the circumstances in the round.   He submits that there  were  good
    reasons set out by the  Judge  for  taking  account  of  the  financial
    evidence.  He submits that the only reason why the  application  failed
    under the immigration rules was because the appellant's partner had not
    provided evidence of sufficient savings around May-June  2014.  By  the
    time of the hearing in May 2015, there was ample evidence of  his  very
    considerable savings. He submits that the Judge was  entitled  to  take
    account of that financial evidence together with the  evidence  of  the
    appellant's  pregnancy  and  previous  miscarriage,  in  reaching   her
    decision that the removal of the appellant is disproportionate  to  the
    need to maintain effective immigration control.

Discussion

18. Before addressing the two grounds of appeal and  the  submissions  made
    before me by the parties, it is useful to set out the general  approach
    that has been taken by the courts upon  the  assessment  of  Article  8
    claims outside the immigration rules since the introduction of Appendix
    FM and paragraph 276ADE.

19. In SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 the Court of  Appeal  considered  the
    proper approach to applications for leave to enter the UK  outside  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis of Article  8  following  the  Court  of
    Appeal's decision in MM (Lebanon) & Others -v-  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    985.  Lord Justice Richards  set  out  the  basic  legal  framework  as
    follows;

         "11. Under the 1971 Act, the Secretary of State has a wide residual
         discretion to grant LTR or LTE outside the  Rules,  i.e.  where  an
         applicant cannot show that they satisfy the conditions in the Rules
         themselves: see R (Munir) -v- SSHD [2012] UKSC  32;  [2012]  1  WLR
         2192, at [44]. An applicant who does  not  satisfy  the  conditions
         stipulated in the Rules may nonetheless have a  good  claim  to  be
         entitled to enter the United Kingdom or to  be  allowed  to  remain
         here  by  reason  of  their  Convention  rights,  e.g.  Article   3
         (protection against torture and inhumane treatment) and Article  8.
         Such a claim arises by virtue of the obligation of the Secretary of
         State under section 6(1) of the HRA to act in a  manner  compatible
         with an individual's Convention rights.

         ...

     14. However, the width of the gap between what  the  Immigration  Rules
         set out by way of entitlement to enter  or  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom and  the  requirements  resulting  from  application  of  a
         relevant Convention right - in these appeals, we are concerned with
         rights under  Article  8  -  may  be  highly  relevant  in  certain
         contexts. This is because,  in  the  immigration  field,  the  fair
         balance required  to  be  struck  pursuant  to  Article  8  between
         individual interests protected by that provision  and  the  general
         public interest typically involves bringing  into  account  certain
         public interest considerations in relation to which  the  Secretary
         of State has a legitimate role to fulfil by formulating an approach
         which gives them proper value and weight. The Secretary of State is
         responsible for the overall operation of the immigration system  as
         a fair system which properly  reflects  and  balances  a  range  of
         interests, including important aspects of the public interest,  and
         she is accountable to Parliament for what she does.

         ...

         17.  If the gap between what Article 8 requires and the content  of
         the Immigration Rules is wide, then the part for the  Secretary  of
         State's residual discretion to play in satisfying the  requirements
         of Article 8 and section 6(1) of the HRA  will  be  correspondingly
         greater. In  such  circumstances,  the  practical  guidance  to  be
         derived from the content of the Rules as to relevant public  policy
         considerations for the purposes of the balance to be  struck  under
         Article 8 is also likely to  be  reduced:  to  use  the  expression
         employed by Aikens LJ in MM (Lebanon) in the Court  of  Appeal,  at
         [135], the proportionality balancing  exercise  "will  be  more  at
         large". If the Secretary of State  has  not  made  a  conscientious
         effort to strike a fair balance for the purposes of  Article  8  in
         making the Rules, a court or tribunal will naturally be disinclined
         to give significant weight to her view regarding the actual balance
         to be struck when the  court  or  tribunal  has  to  consider  that
         question for itself. On the other  hand,  where  the  Secretary  of
         State has sought to fashion the content  of  the  Rules  so  as  to
         strike what she regards as the appropriate balance under Article  8
         and any gap between the  Rules  and  what  Article  8  requires  is
         comparatively narrow, the Secretary of State's formulation  of  the
         Rules may allow the Court to be more confident that she has brought
         a focused assessment of considerations of the  public  interest  to
         bear on the matter. That will in turn allow the Court more  readily
         to give weight to that assessment  when  making  its  own  decision
         pursuant to Article 8. An issue arises on this appeal as to whether
         the Secretary of State has made a conscientious effort to  use  the
         new Immigration Rules to strike the fair balance  which  Article  8
         requires and whether there is a substantial gap,  or  not,  between
         the content of the LTE Rules and the requirements of Article 8."

20. Lord Justice Richards considered the different parts of the immigration
    rules and the tests of exceptional and compelling reasons.  He held:

         "29. It is clear, therefore, that it  cannot  be  maintained  as  a
         general proposition that LTR or LTE outside the  Immigration  Rules
         should only be granted in exceptional cases.  However,  in  certain
         specific contexts, a proper application of  Article  8  may  itself
         make it clear that the legal test for grant of LTR or  LTE  outside
         the Rules should indeed be a test of exceptionality. This  has  now
         been identified to be the  case,  on  the  basis  of  the  constant
         jurisprudence of the ECtHR itself, in relation to applications  for
         LTR outside the Rules  on  the  basis  of  family  life  (where  no
         children are involved) established in the United Kingdom at a  time
         when the presence of one or other of the partners was known  to  be
         precarious: see Nagre, paras. [38]-[43], approved by this court  in
         MF (Nigeria) at [41]-[42].

         ...

         31.  In other contexts, it cannot simply be assumed that  a  strict
         legal test of exceptional circumstances  will  be  applicable  when
         examining the application of  Article  8  outside  the  Immigration
         Rules (or within the Rules themselves, where particular  paragraphs
         are formulated so as fully to cover the applicability of Article 8,
         as in paragraphs 399 and 399A as interpreted in MF (Nigeria)).  The
         relevant general balance  of  public  interest  considerations  and
         individual interests will  vary  between  different  parts  of  the
         Rules. It is only if the normal balance of  interests  relevant  to
         the general area in question is such  as  to  require  particularly
         great weight to be given to the public interest  as  compared  with
         the individual interests at  stake  (as  in  the  precarious  cases
         considered in Nagre and  the  foreign  criminal  deportation  cases
         considered in MF (Nigeria)) that a strict  test  of  exceptionality
         will apply.

         32.  However, even away from those contexts, if  the  Secretary  of
         State has sought to formulate Immigration Rules to reflect  a  fair
         balance of interests under Article 8 in the general  run  of  cases
         falling within their scope, then, as  explained  above,  the  Rules
         themselves will provide significant  evidence  about  the  relevant
         public interest considerations which should be brought into account
         when a court or tribunal seeks to  strike  the  proper  balance  of
         interests under Article 8 in making its own decision. As Beatson LJ
         observed in Haleemudeen -v- SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 558, at [40],  the
         new Rules in Appendix FM:

             "... are a central part of the legislative and policy  context
             in which the interests of  immigration  control  are  balanced
             against the interests and rights of people who  have  come  to
             this country and wish to settle in it. Overall, the  Secretary
             of State's policy as to when an interference with an Article 8
             right  will  be   regarded   as   disproportionate   is   more
             particularised in the new Rules than it had previously been."

         Accordingly, a court or tribunal is required to give the new  Rules
         "greater  weight  than  as  merely  a  starting   point   for   the
         consideration  of  the  proportionality  of  an  interference  with
         Article 8 rights" (para. [47]).

         33.  In our judgment, even though a test of exceptionality does not
         apply in every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it  is
         accurate to say that the general  position  outside  the  sorts  of
         special contexts referred to above is that compelling circumstances
         would need to be identified to support a claim  for  grant  of  LTR
         outside the new Rules in Appendix  FM.  In  our  view,  that  is  a
         formulation which is not as strict as a test of exceptionality or a
         requirement of "very compelling reasons"  (as  referred  to  in  MF
         (Nigeria) in  the  context  of  the  Rules  applicable  to  foreign
         criminals), but which  gives  appropriate  weight  to  the  focused
         consideration of public interest factors as finds expression in the
         Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in  Appendix  FM.
         It also reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which  has
         been tested and has survived scrutiny in  this  court:  see,  e.g.,
         Haleemudeen at [44], per Beatson LJ.

21. Lord Justice Richards also set out the proper approach to the notion of
    a 'complete code' referred to in many cases.  He held;

         "44. The proper approach should always be to identify,  first,  the
         substantive content of the relevant Immigration Rules, both to  see
         if an applicant for LTR or LTE satisfies the conditions  laid  down
         in those Rules (so as to be entitled  to  LTR  or  LTE  within  the
         Rules) and to  assess  the  force  of  the  public  interest  given
         expression in those rules (which will be relevant to the  balancing
         exercise under Article 8, in deciding whether LTR or LTE should  be
         granted outside the substantive provisions set out in  the  Rules).
         Secondly, if an applicant does not satisfy the requirements in  the
         substantive part of the Rules, they may seek to  maintain  a  claim
         for grant of LTR or LTE outside the substantive provisions  of  the
         Rules, pursuant to Article 8. If there  is  a  reasonably  arguable
         case under Article 8 which has not already been sufficiently  dealt
         with by consideration of  the  application  under  the  substantive
         provisions of the Rules (cf Nagre, para. [30]), then in considering
         that case the individual interests  of  the  applicant  and  others
         whose Article 8 rights are in issue should be balanced against  the
         public interest, including as expressed in the Rules, in  order  to
         make an assessment whether refusal to grant LTR or LTE, as the case
         may be, is disproportionate and hence unlawful by virtue of section
         6(1) of the HRA read with Article 8.

         45.  Sometimes, the latter stage of the analysis will be covered by
         the text of the Rules themselves,  as  in  relation  to  the  Rules
         governing  deportation  of  foreign  criminals   reviewed   in   MF
         (Nigeria). Those Rules laid down substantive conditions  which,  if
         satisfied, would lead to the grant of LTR, but also stated that LTR
         might be granted "in exceptional circumstances" if the  substantive
         conditions were not satisfied in a particular case. Where the Rules
         take this form, it can be said that they form a "complete code", in
         the sense that both stages of analysis are covered by the  text  of
         the Rules. But this does not take one very  far,  since  under  the
         "exceptional circumstances" rubric  one  still  has  to  allow  for
         consideration of any matters bearing on the application of  Article
         8 for the purposes of the second stage of the analysis: see,  e.g.,
         AJ (Angola), above, at [46] and [55]. This is the basic point  made
         by this court at paras. [44]-[46] of its judgment in MF (Nigeria).

         46.  In other contexts under the Rules, such as in the sections  of
         the Rules dealing with LTR and LTE, the Rules lay down  substantive
         conditions for grant of leave, but do not themselves say that leave
         should also be granted in other cases where there are  "exceptional
         circumstances". Where  the  Rules  take  this  form,  they  do  not
         constitute a "complete code" in the sense in  which  that  term  is
         used in MF (Nigeria) at [44], since the Rules themselves only cover
         the first stage of analysis referred to above, and the second stage
         is left to be covered under the general law  by  the  Secretary  of
         State's residual discretion, as governed by her  obligations  under
         section 6(1) of the HRA. But just as in the "complete  code"  case,
         the second stage of the analysis will be relevant in this class  of
         case too, and any matters germane to  the  question  whether  there
         would be a violation of Article 8 should be brought into account at
         that stage.

         47.   Therefore, as the court said in MF (Nigeria) at  para.  [45],
         it is a "sterile question" whether one is dealing with a  "complete
         code" case or a case falling to be addressed in the  context  of  a
         part of the Immigration Rules which does not constitute a "complete
         code". The basic, two-stage analysis will apply in both contexts.

         48.  What does matter, however - whether  one  is  dealing  with  a
         section of the Rules which constitutes a "complete code" (as in  MF
         (Nigeria)) or with a section of the Rules which is not a  "complete
         code" (as in Nagre and the present appeals) - is to  identify,  for
         the purposes of application of Article 8, the degree of  weight  to
         be attached to the expression of public policy in  the  substantive
         part of the Rules in the particular context in question (which will
         not always be the same: hence the guidance we seek to give in  this
         judgment), as well as the other factors relevant to the  Article  8
         balancing exercise in the particular case (which, again,  may  well
         vary from context to context and from case to case).

         49.  A further word of explanation is in  order,  before  we  leave
         this section of the judgment. The Secretary  of  State  has  issued
         instructions to officials regarding the approach to be  adopted  to
         granting leave outside the Rules, in  a  paragraph  (para.  3.2.7d)
         entitled "Exceptional circumstances". This is a potential source of
         confusion. For clarity, two points should be made about it.  First,
         this guidance is not part of the Immigration Rules themselves,  and
         so does not make the LTR and LTE  sections  of  the  Rules  into  a
         "complete code" in the sense given that term in MF (Nigeria) -  but
         nothing turns on this, as we have explained. Secondly, the text  of
         the  instructions  makes  it  clear  that  the  term   "exceptional
         circumstances" is given a  wide  meaning  in  the  context  of  the
         instructions, covering any case in which on proper  analysis  under
         Article 8 at the second  stage  it  would  be  disproportionate  to
         refuse leave. The importance of this was highlighted  in  Nagre  at
         [13]-[14] and [49]. Thus, the cases  covered  by  the  "exceptional
         circumstances" guidance in the instructions to officials will  fall
         within a wider or  a  narrower  area  in  line  with  the  changing
         requirements of Article 8 across the  gamut  of  cases  it  covers,
         depending on the  context  in  which  the  cases  arise  and  their
         particular  facts.  As  we  have  sought  to  explain  above,   the
         "exceptional circumstances" contemplated by  the  instructions  are
         not always as narrowly confined as in the foreign criminal  context
         discussed in MF (Nigeria) and the precarious  relationship  context
         discussed in Nagre.

22. In Singh & Khalid -v- SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74, (principally a  decision
    about  which  rules  applied)  Underhill  LJ  summarised  the  position
    generally as follows:-

         "It is now settled that the right  course  in  any  case  where  an
         applicant relies on his or her private or family life is to proceed
         by considering first whether leave  should  be  granted  under  the
         relevant provisions of the new Rules and only if the answer  is  no
         to go on to consider article 8 in its  unvarnished  form  (the  so-
         called "two-stage approach"): see the line of cases which  includes
         Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 45 (IAC) and R (Nagre) v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 7200 (Admin)
         to which I will have to refer more  fully  below.  Thus  article  8
         claims "outside the Rules" are still possible, though the scope for
         their operation is reduced."

23. Thus under section 6(1) of the HRA, a grant of leave outside the  Rules
    is appropriate if, notwithstanding that the  case  is  not  within  the
    Rules, a person has a good claim to be entitled to remain by virtue  of
    Article 8 or any other Convention right.  The decision of  Sales  J  in
    Nagre received the endorsement of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  both  MM
    (Lebanon) and Singh & Khalid and represents the  law.  The  authorities
    establish that there is always a second stage, but where  all  relevant
    considerations have been weighed under the immigration rules and  there
    are no compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under  the
    rules it will be enough for the decision maker simply to say  that.  In
    this kind of case,  the  issue  for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  the
    lawfulness of the refusal to vary the appellant's leave to remain.  The
    duty involves giving proper weight to the public interest as  expressed
    by the respondent in lawfully made rules and guidance (and now applying
    also sections 117A-D of the 2002 Act). The failure to qualify under the
    rules will be tend to suggest that the public interest requires refusal
    of leave to vary, unless some countervailing factors are present  which
    are not already taken into account under the Rules.

24. Failure under the rules where they are either a "full  code"  or  where
    the "gap" between the rules and the Article 8 factors is small, will be
    a strong factor in deciding a freestanding Article 8 claim outside  the
    rules  because  the  claim  will  already  have  been  addressed  to  a
    significant extent when rejecting the claim under the rules. Therefore,
    the exercise at "stage two" is to identify what factors exist which are
    relevant  to  the  proportionality  assessment  which  are  not   fully
    reflected in the rules which are designed to cover  the  generality  of
    cases. Where there are factors which are substantial  but  which  could
    play no, or no sufficient, part in the assessment under the rules, then
    a full assessment will be required in which they are  balanced  against
    all other relevant considerations  including  the  public  interest  in
    effective immigration control.

25. In  reaching  her  decision  that  the  removal  of  the  appellant  is
    disproportionate to the need to maintain effective immigration control,
    the Judge makes the following finding at paragraph [32(vi)];

         "... as indicated at paragraph 33(ii) above the 'Appellant will  be
         separated from [AP] after having miscarried, being  pregnant  again
         and looking to him for support."

    The Judge had regard to  the  matters  set  out  in  s117  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and made the following further findings
    at [32]:

         "(ix)    ... Paragraph 117B(2) does not apply to the  Appellant  as
         the Respondent does  not  dispute  that  the  Appellant  can  speak
         English.  She gave her evidence in English.

         (xi) Under the Immigration Rules there was no evidence that cash of
         �62,500 was available six months prior to the date  of  application
         and therefore I could have no regard to  the  same.  Under  section
         85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  on  an
         appeal under section 82(1), 83(2) or 83A(2) against a decision (the
         Tribunal) may consider evidence about any matter which (it)  thinks
         relevant to the substance of the decision, including evidence which
         concerns a matter arising after the date of  the  decision.  I  can
         therefore have regard to evidence of [AP]'s savings after the  date
         of decision with regard to the Appellant's human rights appeal.  As
         at 20th May 2015 [AP] had some �70,000 in his Co-Op account and  as
         at 11th May 2015 in excess of �60,000 in  his  Nationwide  account.
         Most months from February 2014 he made credits of �2,400 plus  into
         his Nationwide account. He is working as evidenced at page  13  and
         14 of the Appellant's bundle.  I therefore find that the  Appellant
         will be economically independent.

         (xii)    The  Appellant  has  never  been  in  the  United  Kingdom
         unlawfully and therefore paragraph 117B(4) does not apply ...

         (xiii)   In any event the Appellant will be able to return  to  the
         United Kingdom after the birth of her British child."

26. The first ground of appeal advanced by the respondent is that the Judge
    failed "to give  reasons  or  any  adequate  reasons  for  findings  on
    material matters".  The ground has two separate limbs to it.  It is  in
    my judgement, important to distinguish the  two.   A  failure  to  give
    reasons would plainly amount to an error or law, but it is  plain  that
    the Judge did give reasons  at  paragraph  [32]  of  her  decision  and
    reasons, setting out her reasons for reaching the conclusion  that  she
    did.

27. The second limb is that the Judge failed to give adequate  reasons  for
    findings on material matters.  It is now well established that what  is
    required is that the reasons must give sufficient detail  to  show  the
    parties and the appellate tribunal, the principles upon which the lower
    tribunal has acted, and the reasons that led it  to  its  decision,  so
    that they are able to understand  why  it  reached  its  decision.  The
    reasons need not be elaborate, and need not deal  with  every  argument
    presented.

28. In R (Iran) & Ors -v- SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 982,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    drew together the threads of the approach to be adopted in cases  where
    it is claimed that there is an error of law in the Tribunal's  approach
    to the evidence.  Lord Justice Brooke stated:

         "90. It may now be convenient to draw together the main threads  of
         this long judgment in this way. During the period before its demise
         when the IAT's powers were restricted to appeals on points of law:

             1.    Before  the  IAT  could  set  aside  a  decision  of  an
             adjudicator on the grounds of error  of  law,  it  had  to  be
             satisfied that the correction of the error would have  made  a
             material difference to the outcome, or to the fairness of  the
             proceedings. This principle applied equally  to  decisions  of
             adjudicators  on  proportionality  in  connection  with  human
             rights issues;

             2.   A finding might only be set aside for error of law on the
             grounds of perversity if it was irrational or unreasonable  in
             the Wednesbury sense, or one that was  wholly  unsupported  by
             the evidence.

             3.   A decision should not be  set  aside  for  inadequacy  of
             reasons unless the adjudicator failed to identify  and  record
             the matters that were critical to  his  decision  on  material
             issues, in such a way that the IAT was  unable  to  understand
             why he reached that decision.

             4.   A failure without good reason to apply a relevant country
             guidance decision might constitute an error of law.

             5.   At the hearing of an appeal the IAT had  to  identify  an
             error of law in relation to one or more of the  issues  raised
             on the notice of appeal before it could lawfully exercise  any
             of its powers set out in s102(1) of the 2002 Act  (other  than
             affirming the adjudicator's decision).

             6.   Once it had identified an error of  law,  such  that  the
             adjudicator's decision could not stand, the IAT might,  if  it
             saw fit, exercise its power to admit up-to-date evidence or it
             might remit the appeal to the adjudicator with such directions
             as it thought fit.

             7.   If the  IAT  failed  to  consider  an  obvious  point  of
             Convention  jurisprudence  which   would   have   availed   an
             applicant, the Court of Appeal might intervene  to  set  aside
             the IAT's decision on the grounds of error of law even  though
             the point was not raised in the grounds of appeal to the IAT."

29. The respondent submits that having previously found, at paragraph  [25]
    of her decision and reasons, that there are no insurmountable obstacles
    to family life with her partner continuing outside the  UK,  the  Judge
    has failed to adequately explain why the appeal succeeds on  Article  8
    grounds.

30. As I have said, the Judge did give reasons but the question is  whether
    they were adequate  reasons  for  allowing  the  Article  8  claim,  in
    circumstances  where  the  appeal  under  the  immigration  rules   was
    rejected.  In addressing that issue, it is necessary to return  to  the
    relevant authorities on the assessment of Article 8 claims outside  the
    immigration rules.

31. In Nagre -v- SSHD [2013] EWHC 720, Mr Justice Sales considered the  gap
    between paragraph EX.1(b) of the immigration  rules  and  the  relevant
    case law under Article 8.  He said:

         "41. The approach explained in the  Strasbourg  case-law  indicates
         that where family life is established when the  immigration  status
         of the claimant is precarious,  removal  will  be  disproportionate
         only in exceptional cases; and also that consideration  of  whether
         there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  claimant's  resident
         spouse or partner relocating to the claimant's country of origin to
         continue  their  family  life  there  will  be  a  highly  material
         consideration. This is not to say that the question  whether  there
         are insurmountable obstacles to relocation will always be decisive.
         The statement of general approach referred to  above  refers  to  a
         range  of  factors  which   may   bear   upon   the   question   of
         proportionality. For example, the extent to which  there  has  been
         delay by the host state in taking a decision to  remove  a  foreign
         national may be relevant  (a  factor  discussed  in  EB  (Kosovo)).
         Therefore, it cannot be said that in every  case  consideration  of
         the test in  Section  EX.1  of  whether  there  are  insurmountable
         obstacles to relocation will necessarily exhaust  consideration  of
         proportionality, even in the type of precarious  family  life  case
         with which these  proceedings  are  concerned.  I  agree  with  the
         statement by the Upper Tribunal in Izuazu in  the  latter  part  of
         para. [56], that the Strasbourg case-law does not treat the test of
         insurmountable obstacles to relocation as a minimum requirement  to
         be established in a precarious family life case before  it  can  be
         concluded that removal of the  claimant  is  disproportionate;  the
         case-law only treats it as a  material  factor  to  be  taken  into
         account.

         42.  Nonetheless, I consider  that  the  Strasbourg  guidance  does
         indicate that in a precarious family life case, where it is only in
         "exceptional" or "the most exceptional" circumstances that  removal
         of the non-national family member will constitute  a  violation  of
         Article 8, the absence of insurmountable obstacles to relocation of
         other family members to that member's  own  country  of  origin  to
         continue their family life there is likely  to  indicate  that  the
         removal will be proportionate for the purposes of Article  8  .  In
         order to show that, despite the practical possibility of relocation
         (i.e. the absence of insurmountable obstacles to  it),  removal  in
         such a case would nonetheless be disproportionate, one  would  need
         to identify other non-standard and particular features of the  case
         of a compelling nature to show that removal would be  unjustifiably
         harsh.

         43.  On this interpretation of the case-law, the  gap  between  the
         test for leave to remain under EX.1(b) and  the  result  one  would
         arrive at by direct consideration of Article 8  in  the  precarious
         family life class of case is likely to be small. In the majority of
         such cases, if the applicant for leave to remain cannot  show  that
         there are insurmountable obstacles to relocation  of  a  spouse  or
         partner to his or her country of origin so as to meet that part  of
         the test laid down in EX.1(b), they will not be able to  show  that
         their removal is disproportionate."

32. The relevance of  an  appellant's  inability  to  meet  the  evidential
    requirements and the approach to Article 8 in light of Appendix  FM-SE,
    was considered by the Court of Appeal in SS  (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    387.  Their Lordships held:

         "50. The present appeals concern not only the LTE Rules in Appendix
         FM which set out  the  substantive  conditions  which  have  to  be
         satisfied in relation to the  minimum  income  requirements  for  a
         sponsor, but also the Rules in Appendix FM-SE which  stipulate  the
         form  of  evidence  required  to  substantiate  claims   that   the
         substantive financial requirements under Appendix FM have been met.
         Appendix FM-SE deals  with  matters  such  as  the  types  of  bank
         statements, payslips, income, savings and so forth  which  will  be
         regarded  as  acceptable.  In  addition,  section  A1.1(b)  states,
         "Promises of  third  party  support  will  not  be  accepted",  and
         stipulates the highly circumscribed forms which support from  third
         parties is required to take.

         51.  In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light of the
         Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as  in  respect  of  the
         substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM. In other  words,  the
         same general position applies, that compelling circumstances  would
         have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or LTR where  the  evidence
         Rules are not complied with.

         52.  This is for two principal reasons. First, the  evidence  rules
         have the same general objective as the substantive rules, namely to
         limit the risk that someone is admitted into the United Kingdom and
         then becomes a burden on public resources,  and  the  Secretary  of
         State has the same primary function in relation to them, to  assess
         the risk and put in place measures which  are  judged  suitable  to
         contain it within acceptable bounds. Similar weight should be given
         to her assessment of what the  public  interest  requires  in  both
         contexts.

         53.  Secondly, enforcement  of  the  evidence  rules  ensures  that
         everyone applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally and  fairly  in
         relation to the evidential requirements they must satisfy. As  well
         as keeping the costs of administration  within  reasonable  bounds,
         application of standard rules is an important means  of  minimising
         the risk of arbitrary differences in  treatment  of  cases  arising
         across the wide range of  officials,  tribunals  and  courts  which
         administer the system of immigration controls. In this regard,  the
         evidence Rules (like the substantive Rules) serve as a safeguard in
         relation to rights of applicants and family members  under  Article
         14 to equal treatment within the scope of Article 8  :  compare  AJ
         (Angola) , above, at [40], and Huang , above, at [16] ("There will,
         in almost any case, be certain general considerations  to  bear  in
         mind: the general administrative  desirability  of  applying  known
         rules if a  system  of  immigration  control  is  to  be  workable,
         predictable, consistent and  fair  as  between  one  applicant  and
         another; the damage to good administration and effective control if
         a system is perceived by applicants internationally  to  be  unduly
         porous, unpredictable or perfunctory; ... the  need  to  discourage
         fraud, deception and deliberate breaches of  the  law;  and  so  on
         ..."). Good  reason  would  need  to  be  shown  why  a  particular
         applicant was entitled to more preferential treatment with  respect
         to evidence than other applicants would expect to receive under the
         Rules. Moreover,  in  relation  to  the  proper  administration  of
         immigration controls, weight should also be given to the  Secretary
         of State's assessment of  the  evidential  requirements  needed  to
         ensure prompt  and  fair  application  of  the  substantive  Rules:
         compare Stec v United Kingdom , cited at para. [15]  above.  Again,
         if an applicant says that they should be  given  more  preferential
         treatment with respect to evidence than the Rules  allow  for,  and
         more individualised consideration of their case, good reason should
         be put forward to justify that."

33. I am conscious that a decision should not be set aside  for  inadequacy
    of reasons unless the Judge failed to identify and record  the  matters
    that were critical to her decision, on material issues, in such  a  way
    that the  Tribunal  is  unable  to  understand  why  she  reached  that
    decision.  Similarly, judicial restraint should be exercised  when  the
    reasons that a Tribunal gives for its decision are being examined,  and
    it should not be assumed too  readily  that  the  Tribunal  misdirected
    itself because not every step in its reasoning  is  set  out.   I  also
    remind myself that the mere fact that one Tribunal has reached what may
    seem to another as an unduly generous view of the facts, does not  mean
    that it has made an error of law.

34. Having carefully  considered  the  decision  and  reasons  set  out  at
    paragraph [32] of the decision and reasons, in my judgment,  the  Judge
    erred in law on the two grounds advanced by  the  respondent.  This  is
    because she did  not  consider  the  appellant's  Article  8  claim  by
    reference to her earlier  finding  that  there  are  no  insurmountable
    obstacles  to  the  family  life  of  the  appellant  and  her  partner
    continuing overseas.   Paragraph  [32]  of  the  Judge's  decision  and
    reasons  neither  expressly  nor  implicitly,  refer  to  her   earlier
    dismissal of the appeal under the immigration rules.  At  no  stage  in
    her decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds  does  the  Judge
    ask and address the crucial question of whether there are in this  case
    compelling circumstances, to justify allowing the appeal on  Article  8
    grounds where  the  substantive  and  evidential  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules are not met.

35. I accept that it  is  possible  that  a  case  might  be  found  to  be
    exceptional for the purposes of an assessment  under  Article  8,  even
    where  there  are  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  family  life
    continuing  overseas.   However,   the   fact   that   there   are   no
    insurmountable obstacles to the family life continuing  overseas  is  a
    material factor to be taken into account and is likely to indicate that
    the removal will be proportionate for the purposes of  Article  8.   In
    order to show that, despite the absence  of  insurmountable  obstacles,
    removal in such a  case  would  nonetheless  be  disproportionate,  the
    appellant  and  the  Tribunal  must  identify  other  non-standard  and
    particular features of the case, that are of  a  compelling  nature  to
    show that removal would be unjustifiably harsh.  As  Mr  Justice  Sales
    held in Nagre, in the majority of such  cases,  if  the  applicant  for
    leave to remain cannot show that there are insurmountable obstacles  to
    relocation of a spouse or partner to his or her country of origin so as
    to meet that part of the test laid down in EX.1(b), they  will  not  be
    able to show that their removal is disproportionate.

36. In her decision, First-tier Tribunal Judge Foulkes-Jones refers to  the
    fact that the appellant will be separated from [AP] having  miscarried,
    and being pregnant again, looking to him for support.  In my  judgment,
    the miscarriage,  pregnancy  and  the  appellant's  reliance  upon  the
    support of [AP] are factors that would be as  equally  relevant  to  an
    assessment of whether there are insurmountable obstacles to family life
    continuing overseas, as they are to an  assessment  of  proportionality
    under Article 8.  Having found that the appellant has  not  established
    that there would be very significant difficulties which  could  not  be
    overcome or would involve very serious hardship on the evidence  before
    her,  the  appellant's  miscarriage,  pregnancy  and  the  support  she
    received from [AP] could not in my judgment, amount to factors that are
    of a compelling nature to show  that  removal  would  be  unjustifiably
    harsh on Article 8 grounds.

37. The Judge went on to consider that the appellant would be  economically
    independent.  The Judge sets out, at paragraph [32(xi)] of her decision
    and reasons, the information that was before her, as to  the  financial
    resources of [AP], but which she could  not  have  regard  to,  in  her
    consideration of the appeal under the immigration  rules.   Again,  the
    authorities make it plain that compelling circumstances would  have  to
    apply, to justify a grant of leave to remain on Article 8 grounds where
    the evidence rules are not complied with.  The appellant is required to
    demonstrate good reason  why  she  is  entitled  to  more  preferential
    treatment with respect to the evidence,  than  other  applicants  would
    expect to receive under the Rules.

38. In my judgment, the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  discloses  a
    material error of law because the First-tier Tribunal  failed  to  take
    account  of  a  relevant  and  material  consideration.  That  is,  the
    Tribunal's earlier finding that there are no  insurmountable  obstacles
    to the family  life  of  the  appellant  and  her  partner,  continuing
    overseas.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

39. Directions were issued to the parties in advance of the hearing  before
    me requiring the parties to prepare for the hearing on the basis  that,
    if the Upper Tribunal decides to set aside  the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, any further evidence, including supplementary oral
    evidence, that the Upper Tribunal may need to consider if it decides to
    re-make the decision, can be so considered at that hearing. No  further
    evidence was relied upon by the appellant and there was no  application
    made pursuant to rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.

40. For the reasons that I have already set out above, in my judgement, the
    appellant has failed to establish that despite the finding  that  there
    are no insurmountable obstacles to  the  family  life  continuing  from
    overseas, removal would, nonetheless be disproportionate.  There are in
    my judgment no other non-standard and particular features of the  case,
    that are  of  a  compelling  nature  to  show  that  removal  would  be
    unjustifiably harsh for the appellant and her partner.

41. The  appellant  failed  to  establish  that  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing abroad, under the test laid down in
    EX.1(b).  The  appellant  does  not  challenge  that  finding.   In  my
    judgment, in the absence  of  any  other  identifiable  features  of  a
    compelling nature, the appellant  has  failed  to  establish  that  her
    removal is  disproportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  immigration
    control.  The appeal on Article 8 grounds is therefore dismissed.

Notice of Decision

42. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Foulkes-Jones promulgated  on
    1st July 2015 discloses an error of law and is set aside.  I remake the
    decision, dismissing the appeal by the appellant under the  Immigration
    Rules and on Article 8 grounds.

43. No anonymity direction is made.
