Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr G Harrison, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department and  to
    avoid confusion I refer to her as being, "the claimant".

2.   The respondent is a citizen of the Netherlands born on 26th May, 1987.

3.   On 5th November, 2005, the claimant made  a  removal  decision  against
    the respondent, an EU national, and  the  respondent  appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal. His appeal was heard in Manchester  by  Designated
    Immigration Judge McClure.

4.    The  respondent's  family  comprising  his  father,  sister  and   the
    respondent left Somalia  in 1993, because of the ongoing war and  civil
    unrest.  The respondent's grandfather, grandmother and  brother  became
    separated from the respondent and his father and sister en route to the
    United Kingdom.  The respondent and his father and  sister  settled  in
    the Netherlands and the respondent's father and sister  and  respondent
    acquired Netherlands citizenship in or about 1997, when the  respondent
    was about 10 years of age.

5.   At the age of 13, in 2000, the respondent's  father's  sister  and  the
    respondent came to live in Manchester where other family  members  were
    living. The respondent attended school in Manchester following which he
    worked.  Unfortunately, the respondent's father became ill with  cancer
    in or about 2006, and suffered with that awful disease  for  some  five
    years, before dying in 2011.  The respondent completed  his  education,
    taking his 'A'  levels  in  Manchester  in  2005,  and  enrolled  on  a
    foundation degree at Manchester University with  a  view  to  taking  a
    degree in chemical engineering at the university.   Sadly,  apart  from
    his father being ill with  cancer  the  respondent's  grandmother  also
    suffered from cancer and the  respondent  became  carer  for  both  his
    father and grandmother.  His studies suffered as a result  and  instead
    of being awarded a degree, he was awarded an HND in October 2010.

6.   The respondent has several criminal convictions and in April 2004,  was
    cautioned by the police for  theft.   In  2009,  he  was  convicted  at
    Minshull Street  Crown  Court  Manchester  of  four  counts  of  making
    representations to make gain and possessing controlled articles for use
    in fraud. He was given a twelve month community order  and  ordered  to
    pay ï¿½200 costs. On three occasions in 2010, he reappeared  at  Minshull
    Street Crown Court for failure to comply with the community order.

7.   On 5th December, 2012, he  was  convicted  at  Manchester  and  Salford
    Magistrates  Court  of  supplying  controlled  drugs,  namely  Class  B
    cannabis and failing to surrender to custody.  He was given a community
    order and required to carry out unpaid work. On 14th February, 2013, he
    appeared again before Manchester  and  Salford  Magistrates  Court  for
    failing to comply with the requirements of his community  order.   More
    recently,  on  18th  August,  2014,  at  Manchester  Crown  Court   the
    respondent was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and  sentenced
    to two years' imprisonment.

8.   Designated Immigration Judge McClure set out  the  sentencing  comments
    of the judge in full.  He was very well aware that  the  assault  which
    the respondent was involved in was a particularly nasty,  cowardly  and
    vicious assault which left the victim  with  a  broken  jaw  and  brain
    haemorrhage.  Designated  Immigration  Judge   McClure   examined   the
    circumstances and concluded that the respondent did  not  constitute  a
    present and continuing risk to the public and did not find  that  there
    were serious grounds of public policy justifying removal.

9.   The respondent, not satisfied with that decision, sought permission  to
    appeal. Upper Tribunal Judge Gill granted permission and  in  doing  so
    appears to have added further grounds of  challenge.  With  respect  to
    Judge Gill, she had no business identifying further grounds  of  appeal
    on behalf of the respondent.   The Court of Appeal in ex parte Robinson
    made it clear that a judge may grant permission to appeal in respect of
    obvious errors of law, but that was on behalf of an respondent and  was
    in respect of an asylum appeal.  This of course is a deportation appeal
    and the respondent is the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department.
    I indicated to Mr Harrison who appeared on behalf of the  Secretary  of
    State that I was going to ignore Judge Gill's comments. He agreed.

10.  I have, however,  taken  fully  into  account  the  grounds  of  appeal
    submitted by the Secretary of State.   The  grounds  suggest  that  the
    judge erred because the judge noted the respondent's previous  criminal
    history and noted that he had shown little evidence of  taking  courses
    in victim awareness.  He also found that neither university nor  acting
    as a carer for his father and later for his grandmother  had  prevented
    the respondent from entering criminality and had earlier noted  in  his
    determination that the respondent resides at the same  address  he  was
    residing at when he was involved in criminal acts.

11.  It suggests that the judge did not given any  explanation  for  finding
    that the respondent has, in effect, changed his  ways  when  there  was
    littlie or no evidence of  any  engagement  with  services  in  prison.
    Equally the judge does not explain why  the  respondent's  brother  has
    made a material difference when the respondent was  committing  crimes,
    even within the bosom of his closest family, and bearing in  mind  that
    the respondent continues to reside  in  the  same  area  where  he  was
    previously involved in criminality the  judge  failed  to  explore  and
    determine the potential adverse effect of the  influence  of  the  same
    people on the respondent with whom he committed the offence.

12.  Mr Harrison relied on the grounds of  appeal  and  suggested  that  the
    judge had failed to  give  adequate  reasons  for  his  findings.   The
    respondent was present in the  hearing  and  I  explained  to  him  the
    purpose of the hearing to him.  He told me that he  had  no  family  in
    Holland to go back to, that he had  been  in  the  United  Kingdom  for
    sixteen years and his family were supporting him, that his brother  had
    offered him a job and as soon as he was permitted to work he wanted  to
    go and work as an administrator for his brother.

13.  I reserved my decision.

14.  This very experienced Designated Immigration Judge was  well  aware  of
    the respondent's criminal conviction and his 2004 caution. He set  them
    out at paragraph 16 of the determination.  The judge set  out  in  full
    the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge Rudland  at  the  sentencing
    hearing.  It is also clear that the judge had regard to and  considered
    the respondent's letter of 8th July, 2015.   He  first  considered  the
    respondent's length of residence in the United Kingdom and  noted  that
    it was not accepted that the respondent had acquired a permanent  right
    of residence.  He also noted the OASys Report which suggested that  the
    respondent posed a high risk  of  harm  to  the  public  but  that  the
    respondent was at low risk of reoffending.

15.  Judge McClure noted that the refusal letter suggested  that  there  was
    no evidence of the respondent had undertaken any  courses  on  thinking
    skills or  victim  awareness  whilst  in  prison  and  noted  that  the
    Secretary  of  State  believed  that  the  respondent   constituted   a
    sufficiently present and sufficiently serious threat to the  public  to
    justify the deportation order.

16.  Designated Immigration Judge McClure set out the relevant  Regulations,
    Regulation 10, Regulation 15,  Regulation  19,  Regulation  21  of  the
    Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)   Regulations   2006   ("the
    Regulations") and considered and applied MG  and  VC  (Ireland)  [2006]
    UKAIT, Bulale (HB) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2008]
    EWCA Civ 806 and BR (Portugal)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2009] EWCA Civ 923. He also noted HR (Portugal) v Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ  371  and  noted  that
    time spent in prison did not count towards the ten year residence.

17.  Looking at the evidence and having examined  the  additional  documents
    supplied to him, he found himself satisfied  that  the  respondent  had
    been in the United Kingdom  throughout  the  whole  period  through  to
    January 2012, a total of eleven years.  He was  satisfied  that  during
    that period of time the respondent was receiving education  and  was  a
    dependant of his father  who  was  an  EEA  qualified  person  for  the
    purposes of the Regulations.  The judge was also satisfied that  during
    that period of time the respondent  would  have  acquired  a  permanent
    right of residence and, as such, is entitled to  the  higher  level  of
    protection provided to a person who has acquired a permanent  right  of
    residence.

18.  Having examined the respondent's activities as a  carer,  he  concluded
    that the respondent had a permanent right of residence which he had not
    lost and accordingly there needed to be shown serous grounds of  public
    policy to justify removal of the respondent.

19.  The judge makes it clear at paragraph 70 of the determination  that  he
    has taken account of what the Crown Court Judge said and of  the  OASys
    Report; indeed he agrees  that  there  was  little  evidence  that  the
    respondent had undertaken courses in victim awareness  or  appreciating
    the impact of criminal behaviour on others.  He was right  to  indicate
    that it was a single incident of violence although the  respondent  did
    have other convictions and  appears  on  occasions  not  to  have  been
    cooperating with the authorities in carrying out  community  sentences.
    He noted the respondent's age and the fact that he had gone  to  school
    in the United Kingdom and  undertaken  courses  at  university.   As  a
    result of the support he gave for family members  as  their  carer  his
    studies suffered. The judge noted that that did not stop the respondent
    being involved in criminal offences but was clearly influenced  by  the
    fact that the respondent now has a job with his brother and he was also
    satisfied that the brother  was  exercising  some  influence  over  the
    respondent.  He heard oral evidence from the respondent's brother  and,
    I believe, was entitled in the circumstances to find as he did that the
    respondent did not constitute a continuing risk to the public.

20.  I have concluded that the judge did not err and was  entitled  to  find
    as he did. When read as a whole it is perfectly  clear  why  the  judge
    arrived at the conclusions he did.  He noted that the offence which the
    respondent had been involved was a serious criminal offence  but  noted
    also that the respondent had accepted responsibility for  his  part  in
    that offence and was now under the influence of  his  brother  who  was
    prepared to employ the respondent. The judge was entitled to find  that
    there  were  no  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  justifying   the
    respondent's removal.

Notice of Decision

21.  I have  concluded  therefore  that  in  making  his  determination  and
    reaching the decision he did Designated Immigration Judge  McClure  did
    not err in law. His determination shall stand.

22.  No anonymity direction is made.
