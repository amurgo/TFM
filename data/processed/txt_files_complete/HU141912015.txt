Representation:
For the Appellant:          Ms K McCarthy (counsel instructed by OTS
Solicitors)

Officer) (2017)
      Mr I Jarvis (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer) (2018)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Iryna Valdayeva, a citizen of  Ukraine  born  8
       October  1988,  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       dismissing her appeal against the Respondent's refusal (on 9 December
       2015) of her human rights claim, dated 21 January 2016.


    2. She was granted entry clearance as a student, entering the UK  on  18
       July 2005, her leave being subsequently  extended  until  31  October
       2011; an application for further  leave  as  a  Tier  4  student  was
       refused, on 12 January 2012. She lodged an appeal on 1 February  2012
       which was allowed on 19 June 2012. An  administrative  error  by  the
       Home Office meant that that decision was not implemented so that  her
       student leave was not reinstated. She subsequently applied for  leave
       to remain as the spouse of a settled person, which was granted  until
       19 May 2016. On 24 November 2015 she applied for indefinite leave  to
       remain on the basis of having lived in the UK lawfully for ten years.




    3. Her application was refused, because she  had  been  absent  from  23
       December 2010 to 9 September 2011 studying abroad, which amounted  to
       an excess absence exceeding the permitted 540 days over a  five  year
       period, being 633 days. This was  not  considered  to  have  been  an
       absence that should be treated as  exceptional,  so  her  application
       failed under the Rules. Her application, in so far as it fell  to  be
       considered under the Partner route, was otiose, as she retained leave
       at the date of decision.  Regarding her private  life,  she  had  not
       shown that she would face very significant obstacles  to  integration
       in Ukraine were she to return there.


    4. She lodged an appeal on the basis that she had been required to study
       abroad, under the Erasmus programme, as part  of  her  UK  university
       course. It was her case that this essential study abroad amounted  to
       an exceptional circumstance that rendered the exercise of  discretion
       appropriate when the Secretary of State  considered  her  application
       for indefinite leave to remain.


    5. The Appellant had put a  written  submission  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, unheaded but nevertheless setting out  her  case  in  full.
       Following her studies in the UK she had worked with a  German  stock-
       listed company and now for an investment litigation fund in the  City
       of London.


    6. She had retained no ties with Ukraine, a country she had not  visited
       for many years, and where her family had left  a  long  time  ago  to
       migrate to the Czech Republic. She had lived there herself  from  the
       age of ten, though the length of time taken by  the  Home  Office  to
       consider her application had  meant  that  she  had  been  unable  to
       continue her visits there, and her residence rights had  lapsed.  She
       had not lived in Ukraine since the age of ten, a  country  which  was
       now riven by civil war and corruption scandals; she had no family  or
       friends there, and did not even speak the  language  well  enough  to
       find employment. She had spent over a decade in the United Kingdom as
       a tax-paying adult. She opined that the man on  the  Clapham  omnibus
       would be likely to think her claim well founded.


    7. The First-tier Tribunal recorded  her  evidence  that  she  had  been
       awarded  an  upper  second  Honours  degree  in  History  and  German
       Language, with a compulsory year's placement abroad, from Queen  Mary
       University, London. The Tribunal found that she would face return  to
       Ukraine rather than the Czech Republic, where her family lived, given
       that her own right to reside  there  had  been  extinguished  by  her
       absence. The First-tier Tribunal was under the  impression  that  her
       evidence was that  she  had  not  enquired  into  whether  she  could
       reinstate her leave again; she had managed to do so in December  2013
       (it will be seen that this impression appears to be inconsistent with
       the evidence placed before it, set out above).


    8. The First-tier Tribunal upheld the Respondent's reasons for  refusing
       the application under the Rules; she had  indeed  accumulated  excess
       absence. Her course had been a matter of her own choice and  did  not
       represent a relevant exceptional circumstance. She was no longer in a
       relationship and accordingly had no relevant family life in play. She
       had had some education in Ukraine, could speak the local language, as
       well as German and English, and her family could tell her about  life
       there notwithstanding that they themselves did not live  there,  even
       if their information was not  up-to-date.  She  was  intelligent  and
       articulate and could  be  expected  to  make  enquiries  of  relevant
       organisations to familiarise herself with the  situation  there.  She
       was in good health and educated to degree level. All  this  indicated
       that she  face  no  very  significant  obstacles  to  integration  in
       Ukraine. Considering her claim outside the Immigration  Rules,  there
       was nothing in the evidence, having regard to her time in the  United
       Kingdom as a student and in  a  failed  relationship,  to  reach  the
       threshold for engagement of the right to private and family life.


    9. The Appellant appealed, on the basis that it was irrational  to  find
       that Article 8 ECHR was not engaged given her connections  with  this
       country, and that the operation of the long residence  Rule  and  the
       discretion that lay alongside it  was  relevant  to  her  ability  to
       demonstrate  that  it  would  be  disproportionate  to  require   her
       departure from the United Kingdom.


   10. Judge Grant-Hutchinson granted permission on 8 November 2017  on  the
       basis that it was arguable the Judge  had  failed  to  give  adequate
       reasons as to whether the Appellant fell within Rule  276ADE(vi)  and
       by failing to apply section 117B.

Error of law hearing

   11. The Respondent provided a Rule 24 notice  in  setting  out  that  the
       disposition of the appeal was perfectly compatible with the  approach
       to precarious residence  identified  in  AM  Malawi,  and  that  full
       reasons had been given; the reference to insurmountable obstacles  as
       the appropriate test was not a material error of law as there was  no
       real difference  between  that  and  very  significant  obstacles  to
       integration, and no matter relevant to the ultimate  issue  had  been
       left out of account.


   12. Before me Ms  McCarthy  argued  that  the  connections  held  by  the
       Appellant could not rationally be rejected  as  constituting  private
       life in the United Kingdom, and that her length of  lawful  residence
       was plainly highly relevant to the proportionality  of  her  removal.
       She would face very significant obstacles to integration  in  Ukraine
       and the finding to the contrary was perverse. Ms  Fujiwala  countered
       that the reasoning was generally adequate and in no way perverse, and
       compatible with  decisions  such  as  AS  (EWCA)  which  showed  that
       reasoned assumptions as to a person's ability to integrate  based  on
       their education and family connections  were  a  legitimate  mode  of
       assessing ability to integrate.


Findings and reasons: error of law hearing


   13. Having considered the matter with care, I agreed that the decision of
       the First-tier Tribunal was flawed  for  the  reasons  given  in  the
       grounds of appeal.


   14. Within the Rules, the question for the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  to
       evaluate  whether  or  not  the  Appellant  faced  very   significant
       obstacles to her integration in Ukraine. As stated  by  Sales  LJ  in
       Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813, the concept of integration

           "... is not confined to the mere ability to find  a  job  or  to
           sustain life while living  in  the  other  country.  It  is  not
           appropriate to treat the statutory language as subject  to  some
           gloss and it will usually be sufficient for a court or  tribunal
           simply to direct itself in the terms that Parliament has  chosen
           to use. The idea of "integration" calls for a  broad  evaluative
           judgment to be made as to whether the individual will be  enough
           of an insider in terms of understanding how life in the  society
           in  that  other  country  is  carried  on  and  a  capacity   to
           participate in it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity to  be
           accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-day  basis  in
           that society and to build up within a reasonable time a  variety
           of human relationships to give  substance  to  the  individual's
           private or family life."

   15. It was correct, as Ms Fujiwala noted, that Moylan  LJ  stated  in  AS
       [2017] EWCA Civ 1284 that "generic"  factors  such  as  intelligence,
       employability and general robustness of character are relevant to the
       "broad evaluative judgment" required in assessing whether  there  are
       very significant obstacles to integration abroad and may  demonstrate
       that the person is "enough  of  an  insider"  in  the  Kamara  sense.
       However, generic factors are unlikely to trump more precise  evidence
       in the case that relates to an  individual's  general  circumstances.
       Passing familiarity with current affairs reminds one that Ukraine has
       suffered significant changes since the time when the  Appellant  left
       the country. She had only lived in Ukraine for the  first  decade  of
       her twenty-eight years, and  her  family  have  lived  abroad  for  a
       similar  period.  This  combination   of   circumstances   does   not
       necessarily render it impossible for her to integrate in Ukraine, but
       it seems to me that  rather  more  was  required  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal than its generalised reference to her potential recourse  to
       "national bodies and relevant organisations" in  determining  whether
       she would be able to operate there on a daily basis and  meaningfully
       interact with other people.


   16. Lord Sumption stated in Hayes v Willoughby [2013] UKSC 17 at [14]:

           "A test of rationality ... applies a minimum objective  standard
           to  the  relevant  person's  mental  processes.  It  imports   a
           requirement of good faith, a requirement that  there  should  be
           some logical connection between the evidence and the  ostensible
           reasons for the decision, and (which will usually amount to  the
           same thing) an absence of arbitrariness, of capriciousness or of
           reasoning so outrageous in  its  defiance  of  logic  as  to  be
           perverse."

       It seemed to me that there was no clear  logical  connection  between
       the evidence relied upon by the First-tier Tribunal and  its  reasons
       for its decision. It was not discernible from  the  relatively  brief
       reasoning  how  it   was   that   "national   bodies   and   relevant
       organisations" and information which the Tribunal itself acknowledged
       would "not be up to date" could make good the disadvantages caused by
       having lived outside a country for her formative years and her entire
       adult life, the total absence  of  direct  and  extended  family  and
       friends, and her limited language proficiency.


   17. Accordingly I ruled that the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  with
       regard to Rule 276ADE(vi) was legally flawed.


   18. For completeness it was also appropriate to address, at the error  of
       law stage, the First-tier Tribunal's approach outside the  Rules.  As
       indicated above, it found that the relatively low threshold  for  the
       engagement of Article 8 ECHR was not met. As stated by  Underhill  LJ
       in Ahsan and Ors [2017] EWCA Civ 2009 at [86], concisely  summarising
       the authorities governing the approach  to  private  life  in  recent
       years, "persons admitted to this country to pursue a course of  study
       are likely, over time, to develop a private life of sufficient  depth
       to engage article 8."


   19. Given that starting point, it was somewhat surprising for more than a
       decade  of  lawful  residence,  including  work  and  studies  at   a
       professional level in  the  City  of  London,  to  be  found  not  to
       constitute private life. The fact that the  Appellant  had  formed  a
       sufficiently serious relationship to marry a British citizen was also
       indicative of the  extent  to  which  she  saw  her  life  as  having
       effectively transferred to  the  United  Kingdom,  even  though  that
       relationship had not endured. The First-tier Tribunal failed to  give
       adequate reasons for determining that these very  strong  connections
       did not amount to private life in the light of the  authorities  such
       as Ahsan indicating the contrary.


   20. Clearly the First-tier Tribunal would have approached proportionality
       differently had it found that the Appellant had  established  private
       life in the United Kingdom. In these circumstances I found  that  the
       First-tier Tribunal materially  erred  in  law  in  its  approach  to
       Article 8 outside the Rules.


   21. I accordingly concluded that the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  was
       flawed by material errors of law on each head of the appeal. As  only
       limited fact-finding remained,  it  was  appropriate  to  retain  the
       matter in the Upper Tribunal.





Continuation hearing


   22. Further evidence was provided for the continuation hearing. Ms Migula-
       Gawron,  the  Appellant's  best  friend,  wrote  of   their   lengthy
       friendship and how she admired her perseverance in her  studies;  she
       had witnessed her studying in  Cambridge  every  weekend  whilst  she
       worked in the week in the City. The Appellant's divorce had been  "an
       incredibly difficult and painful time  for  her".  A  letter  from  a
       friend of the Appellant, Ms Gibbons of Barnes, SW13, stated that  the
       Appellant would be sorely missed by herself, friends and  neighbours,
       if she left the country; she had shown kindness and patience  in  her
       relationship with Ms  Gibbon's  daughter,  and  had  bonded  with  Ms
       Gibbons's own social network and indeed had taught German to  one  of
       her colleagues.


   23. The Appellant's further witness statement set out that when she  came
       to this country, she had necessarily left her friends  in  the  Czech
       Republic and had initially found that very hard. But she made friends
       at her boarding house in Cambridge where she completed her  secondary
       education, and had  gone  on  to  read  German  and  History  at  the
       University of London, and become immersed in every aspect of  British
       culture, from roast dinners to arts and culture. She had been working
       in the City for a litigation funder. Her relationship with her former
       partner had broken down in "a horrid way", and she had lived  in  the
       UK for nearly fourteen years, since she was sixteen, and she felt her
       life here had great merit. She had now formed a new relationship with
       a partner and they were saving for a house, but she did not presently
       feel able to rely on that as part of her  claim  to  remain  in  this
       country. Her best friend  Ms  Migula-Gawron  had  provided  "amazing"
       emotional support to her throughout her time here.


   24. The Appellant had been unable to complete her legal training  as  her
       lack of permanent residence  in  the  UK  was  held  against  her  by
       employers. She  had  not  visited  Ukraine  since  her  grandmother's
       funeral some sixteen years ago. She knew nothing of the country  save
       for the unstable political situation; she did  not  know  how  people
       spent their spare time, the holidays they  celebrated,  or  what  was
       socially acceptable: she had read online that  women  did  not  shake
       hands there. She had no family in the little village  in  Lviv  where
       she was born, and she had come to appreciate, from  watching  YouTube
       videos, that the dialect spoken in her family home was  a  particular
       local form of the language, known as Galician.


   25. She had investigated job opportunities where speaking  Czech,  German
       or English would be an asset, but in all those circumstances, it  was
       very clear that one would be expected to speak  Ukrainian  well.  The
       only work available for expatriates was of an uncertain kind, such as
       work  in  the  charitable  sector,  for  example  helping  internally
       displaced persons (IDPs). She feared the prospect of being unable  to
       support herself and effectively being forced into the position of  an
       IDP and requiring humanitarian aid. The  only  thing  that  made  her
       Ukrainian was her passport. She said that she did  not  claim  to  be
       British, but she felt like a Londoner.


   26. Also before me was  the  Secretary  of  State's  Country  Policy  and
       Information Note - Ukraine: Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk (29 September
       2017) which materially states:

           "7.6.3 The same report added, 'UN  agencies  reported  that  the
           influx of IDPs led to  tensions  arising  from  competition  for
           resources. Critics accused internally displaced men who moved to
           western areas of the country of evading military service,  while
           competition  rose  for  housing,  employment,  and   educational
           opportunities in Kyiv and Lviv.'"

   27. The Appellant gave oral evidence. She adopted her witness  statement.
       She said that her parents still lived in the Czech Republic; she  was
       in touch with them by telephone. Her parents could not really  assist
       her: although they worked, they  earned  very  little.  She  financed
       herself via her �52,000 salary; additionally she held �10,000 savings
       in a joint account. Whilst she thus had �5,000  to  use  towards  re-
       establishing herself in Ukraine, she queried  how  long  those  funds
       would last, given she had no ability to find work, and no  family  or
       friends there to fall back on. She had made enquiries regarding  work
       there, but had resolved that this would be hard, given she had  grown
       up speaking Czech and had since spent many years in the UK. She spoke
       some Ukrainian, like that of a child; at home during her  youth  they
       spoke Czech.


   28. For the Respondent, Mr Jarvis submitted that  the  reasoning  of  the
       Secretary of State when refusing the application  on  long  residence
       grounds was essentially a matter for the Home Office;  there  was  no
       longer any power to review cases on "not in accordance with the  law"
       grounds. AS  Afghanistan  showed  that  generic  considerations  were
       potentially relevant, and Rule 276ADE did not posit an  investigation
       into whether circumstances abroad matched  a  person's  lifestyle  in
       this country; rather the Rule  measured  whether  core  private  life
       interests could survive abroad, allowing for the prospect of a  young
       person forming new friendships in their country of origin.  The  Home
       Office Guidance on  the  internally  displaced  was  not  necessarily
       relevant to an educated returnee,  but  nevertheless  suggested  that
       many IDPs had relocated successfully. Outside the Rules,  whilst  the
       Appellant had doubtless  established  private  life  given  her  long
       lawful  residence,  it  was  not  established  that  she  would  face
       unjustifiably harsh consequences  using  the  test  in  276ADE  as  a
       starting point, bearing in mind that there  had  been  no  legitimate
       expectation of permanent residence in this country if  the  Appellant
       had been unable to meet the Rules at any  particular  time,  and  her
       claim was essentially based upon a desire to work and live in UK.


   29. Ms McCarthy submitted that the Appellant only spoke a dialect of  the
       Ukrainian language and that could not be relied upon  to  communicate
       adequately in areas of possible relocation. The Home Office  decision
       maker  had  failed  to  consider  whether   there   were   compelling
       circumstances justifying the exercise  of  discretion  vis-�-vis  her
       excess absence from the UK,  having  regard  to  the  fact  that  the
       Appellant would have been in breach of her conditions  of  leave  had
       she failed to study abroad in line with  the  terms  of  the  Erasmus
       Programme.


Findings and reasons: continuation hearing

Very significant obstacles to integration in Ukraine

   30. As set  out  above,  the  test  for  very  significant  obstacles  to
       integration should take account of considerations such as the ability
       of a returnee to build relationships within a meaningful  period  and
       to participate in society as an insider.  Generic  factors,  such  as
       language  proficiency,  and   reasonable   assumptions   as   to   an
       availability to form new friendships  in  the  context  of  work  and
       otherwise, and perhaps resume old ones depending  on  one's  personal
       history, are relevant; it is not open to a person to deny  their  own
       adaptability without putting an evidence-backed case.


   31. The Appellant has lived outside the Ukraine for much of her life, and
       for all of that portion of her  life  which  she  can  reasonably  be
       expected to remember in any great detail. Her  formative  years  have
       been spent wholly abroad. Language skills are clearly central to  the
       ability to negotiate a society  where  one  has  never  lived  during
       adolescence and adulthood. So too is social capital: it  is  normally
       to be expected that a returnee will have the benefit  of  family  and
       something  by  way  of  a  friendship  network  to  assist  them   in
       negotiating society. But those possibilities are denied the Appellant
       by the departure of her immediate family from Ukraine, the  death  of
       her grandmother, and the fact that she herself left the country at  a
       young age.


   32. Whilst the Appellant clearly has some aptitude in learning languages,
       I do not think that one can readily assume that she would be able  to
       learn mainstream Ukrainian with the speed and facility that would  be
       necessary  to  be  able  to  find  work  in  the   rather   difficult
       circumstances that the country presently endures. The  Home  Office's
       own country evidence shows that the available opportunities there are
       constrained by the consequences of armed conflict, and it  notes  the
       "shortage  of  employment  opportunities  and  the   generally   weak
       economy". It seems to me that the Appellant's lack of social  capital
       and  connections  to  draw  upon  would  put  her  at  a   particular
       disadvantage. She has not lived amongst a diaspora community  in  the
       UK and nor did she live there at a time when she could reasonably  be
       expected  to  have  absorbed  the  cultural   norms   (both   factors
       highlighted by the UKVI Guidance as relevant).


   33. It is doubtful that she would be driven into the abject situation  of
       many IDPs, but the fact that many people have had to  uproot  in  the
       aftermath of the armed  conflict  does  suggest  that  the  country's
       capacity to absorb new arrivals will inevitably  be  limited.  It  is
       difficult to see how the prospect of  deploying  her  modest  savings
       plus any remittances from parents who are plainly not well off  could
       meaningfully ameliorate her circumstances; she would speedily need to
       find work, and her inability to  speak  the  mainstream  language  is
       plainly going to seriously disadvantage her in finding work in any of
       the professional roles for which her background  qualifies  her.  The
       prospect of her being able to compete  for  manual  labour  with  the
       indigent population seems simply unrealistic.


   34. For these reasons, I find the Appellant would face  very  significant
       obstacles to her integration into the Ukraine.

Article 8 claim outside the Rules

   35. I should also address her claim outside the Rules.  As  pragmatically
       accepted by Mr Jarvis, it would be  very  difficult  to  dispute  the
       conclusion that the Appellant has established  private  life  in  the
       United Kingdom. She has lived here lawfully for many years. As stated
       by Underhill LJ in Ahsan [2017] EWCA Civ 2009, "persons  admitted  to
       this country to pursue a course of study are likely,  over  time,  to
       develop a private life of sufficient depth to engage article 8."


   36. Furthermore she has clearly formed  significant  relationships,  with
       close friends upon whom she clearly  has  some  degree  of  emotional
       dependency, and her degree of integration in this country is shown by
       the fact that she married a British citizen, her former husband,  and
       the undisputed fact that she is again  in  a  long-term  relationship
       here. She has a professional career in this country.  In  Niemietz  v
       Germany [1992] ECHR 80 at [29] the ECtHR recognised that private life
       goes beyond one's "inner circle"  of  relationships  onwards  to  the
       "outside world" which one inhabits: one's  "private  life  must  also
       comprise to a certain degree  the  right  to  establish  and  develop
       relationships with other human beings."


   37. Plainly she has established the very strongest form of  private  life
       in the United Kingdom, based on lengthy residence over a period which
       has comprised  her  most  significant  formative  years:  her  recent
       schooling,  university  studies  and  professional  development  have
       wholly taken place here, and all her  significant  relationships  are
       here, save for those with her parents and perhaps with school friends
       in the Czech Republic, a country to  which  it  is  not  proposed  to
       return her and  to  where  there  is  no  evidence  to  show  she  is
       admissible.


   38. The real question in this appeal is whether her  departure  would  be
       disproportionate to her private life interests having regard  to  the
       public interest. Section 117B  Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act
       2002 posits a series of questions which the Tribunal  must  confront,
       regarding the Appellant's  English  language  proficiency,  financial
       independence, and the precariousness of her residence.


   39. The Appellant speaks fluent  English  and  earns  a  very  reasonable
       salary from which she supports herself, so considerations of language
       and finance do not count against her. The  question  of  whether  her
       residence is precarious must be approached on  an  evaluative  basis.
       Sales LJ in Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803  �44   stated  that  it  was
       doubtful that it was correct that any grant of limited leave to enter
       or remain short of ILR qualifies as "precarious" for the purposes  of
       section 117B(5). As is clear from the decisions of the Supreme  Court
       in Hesham Ali, MM Lebanon and Agyarko, the question of precariousness
       is not simply resolved by the possession of leave short of indefinite
       leave  to  remain:  rather  it  is  an   evaluative   exercise.    as
       demonstrated by the Supreme  Court's  recent  ruling  in  Hesham  Ali
       (Iraq) [2016] UKSC 60, epitomised by Lord Wilson at [108]  (and  Lord
       Reid at 25-27, 33-45) that:

           "The fact that an applicant is or is not a settled migrant  -  a
           settled migrant being someone who has been granted some form  of
           residence, whether temporary  or  indefinite  -  is  likewise  a
           relevant factor".

   40. This is not a case where I consider that  the  Appellant's  residence
       can be treated as precarious. She entered the country as  a  student,
       which is a short-term form of residence, though  she  was  of  course
       sent  here  by  her  parents.  Then  she  lawfully  switched  into  a
       settlement category, that of spouse,  albeit  that  the  relationship
       broke down. I do not consider that her successful  efforts  to  fully
       integrate here can be held against her in  these  circumstances.  Her
       behaviour has consistently been a natural human response to difficult
       circumstances.


   41. The statutory factors aside, whether  or  not  the  difficulties  she
       faced in Ukraine technically qualify as very significant obstacles to
       integration, they would plainly represent a very different future  to
       her life here. She has close friends here upon whom  she  has  become
       emotionally  dependent  during  traumatic  life  events,  she  has  a
       professional career ahead of her, and it is readily apparent that she
       would be an asset to the community. Abroad she  would  be  forced  to
       start from scratch without social capital to  support  her  and  very
       distant from anyone to whom she is emotionally close. Whereas in this
       country, she would plainly be an asset to the community, contributing
       via her strong language skills to  her  chosen  profession  and  more
       generally, given her earning potential, to tax revenues.


   42. She has achieved a length of lawful residence in this  country  which
       would normally qualify her for  settlement  in  its  own  right;  her
       application to such effect was defeated only by a period of residence
       abroad for reasons that were essential to the very studies for  which
       she was granted leave. It is of course open to the Secretary of State
       to administer the immigration system so as to  exclude  persons  from
       the automatic grant of leave where a spell  abroad  was  for  reasons
       falling short of some humanitarian compulsion. However this does  not
       mean, when  a  case  is  evaluated  having  regard  to  all  relevant
       considerations, that the motivation for a period of study  abroad  is
       irrelevant. I do not consider that her perfectly reasonable adherence
       to  the  strictures  of  the  Erasmus  Programme  can  be  viewed  as
       undermining  the  very  strong  ties  with  this  country  that   she
       subsequently developed.


   43. For all these reasons, I find that  the  Appellant's  departure  from
       this country would be disproportionate to her Article 8 rights.



Decision

The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.
