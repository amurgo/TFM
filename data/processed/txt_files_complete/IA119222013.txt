Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Bazini, instructed by E2W (UK) Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The Court of Appeal remitted this appeal, by consent, to the  Upper
         Tribunal by order dated 25th February 2015 for the  Upper  Tribunal
         to reconsider the appeal on the pleaded grounds. We did not have  a
         copy of the statement of reasons but had  a  copy  of  the  grounds
         pleaded to the Court of Appeal and the grounds  originally  pleaded
         requesting permission to appeal from the First-tier Tribunal to the
         Upper Tribunal.

      2. It was agreed with the parties that we should proceed on the  basis
         that the whole of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Parkes' determination
         should be ignored and that the issue before us  was  whether  there
         was an error of law in the  First-tier  Tribunal  determination  of
         Judge Devlin, which had been heard on 19th August 2013,  such  that
         the determination be set aside to be remade.

      3. At the commencement of the hearing we indicated that it appeared to
         us, subject of course to submissions, that there were concerns over
         the way in which Judge Devlin had apparently failed to factor  into
         his consideration issue with regards to the  sponsor's  citizenship
         and health matters; the involvement the sponsor and appellant  have
         with the sponsor's Down Syndrome nephew; issues  of  the  sponsor's
         potential employment and the consequent ability to meet  the  costs
         of  accommodation,  and  the  apparent  import  of  the   test   of
         insurmountable obstacles into consideration of the  proportionality
         of removal under Article 8. There were a number  of  other  matters
         which are referred to in the grounds seeking permission  to  appeal
         to the Upper Tribunal which on their own would in all likelihood be
         insignificant but when considered as a whole we indicated  that  it
         did appear that the First-tier Tribunal judge had erred in law  and
         the decision should be set aside to  be  remade.  Mr  Bramble  very
         sensibly acknowledged these issues and took  the  view  that  these
         matters did indicate errors of law such that the  decision  be  set
         aside to be remade.

      4. We set aside the determination. Both parties agreed  that  we  were
         able to proceed to remake the decision. The appellant had submitted
         an up to date bundle of documents and Mr Bramble confirmed that  he
         only wished to cross- examine the sponsor, the other evidence being
         accepted. Mr Bazini referred to  the  length  of  the  relationship
         between the couple. Mr Bramble correctly pointed out the finding by
         the First-tier Tribunal judge that the relationship  had  been  one
         akin to marriage only from 2009 and that this finding had not  been
         disputed in the grounds seeking permission to  appeal.  He  however
         acknowledged the obvious point  that  the  relationship  must  have
         commenced  prior  to  2009  even  though  it   had   not   acquired
         'permanence' until 2009. Mr Bazini did not pursue  this  issue.  We
         then heard submissions.

    Findings of fact preserved from the First-tier  Tribunal  determination
    and unchallenged or accepted factual findings before us

      1. The appellant is a British National (Overseas), born  7th  February
         1971.

      2. The decision the subject of appeal is  a  decision  to  remove  the
         appellant pursuant to s10 Immigration and Asylum  Act  1999  served
         5th April 2013. Before us the appellant contends that she meets the
         requirements of the Immigration Rules and/or her removal  would  be
         in breach of Article 8.

      3. The appellant first came to the UK  on  23rd  February  2004  as  a
         visitor. She was granted successive  periods  of  leave  to  remain
         until 30th November 2008.

      4. The appellant met the sponsor in 2005. Between 9th  and  13th  June
         they spent a four day holiday together.

      5. In July 2009 the appellant was hospitalised  after  a  fall  and  a
         broken back and after her discharge went to stay with  the  sponsor
         from 23rd July 2009.

      6. On 25th  September  2009  the  appellant  was  convicted  of  money
         laundering and sentenced to 10 months  imprisonment.  She  was  not
         recommended for deportation and the  respondent  did  not  consider
         whether to make  a  deportation  order  against  her.  The  sponsor
         visited her 7 times whilst she was in prison and on her release  it
         was agreed between them that she  could  use  his  address  as  her
         release address and was released to his Middlewich address.  It  is
         not clear when her temporary admission address was changed  to  the
         Ilkley address although it is accepted that they have  been  living
         there together since May 2011 when the sponsor found employment  in
         that area.

      7. On 9th April 2010 the sponsor asked the  appellant  to  marry  him;
         they were married on 15th October 2010 in church.  Her  application
         for leave to remain as the spouse of a British Citizen was  refused
         on 29th March 2011 with  no  right  of  appeal.  Following  further
         submissions on 7th November 2012 and 17th December  2012  that  the
         appellant met the requirements of the Rules for  limited  leave  to
         remain and that her removal would be a breach of Article 8 she  was
         served with the s10 removal decision.

      8. The appellant has one brother, two sisters and one brother  in  law
         in the UK. Her parents, other brothers and sisters and  a  daughter
         from her previous marriage live in Hong Kong. Her parents live in a
         three bedroom, 1 sitting room, 1 shower and 1  kitchen  flat.  Also
         living there are her  father's  older  and  younger  brothers;  the
         appellant's older sister and  the  appellant's  daughter  from  her
         earlier marriage; the appellant's younger sister  and  her  husband
         and son; the appellant's brother and his wife (11 people in total).
         There is insufficient room for the appellant  and  her  husband  to
         also live there. The family would only be able to  offer  emotional
         support, not financial or other  practical  support.  They  are  in
         contact via Skype and telephone

      9. The sponsor is part of a close knit family with a brother,  sister,
         three nephews, three nieces, a great niece, two  aunts  and  uncles
         and several other cousins. He sees his brother,  sister  and  their
         children every six weeks or so. All the children are adults but one
         of them  (aged  28)  has  Down  Syndrome.  He  lives  in  sheltered
         accommodation suitable for his needs with full time carers.

     10. In 2009 the sponsor was made redundant from  his  then  employment.
         After discussions with a friend he made some plans to travel to New
         Zealand where there was a possibility of a 12 month contract for  a
         job with Air New Zealand. He did not  intend  to  emigrate  to  New
         Zealand permanently and in the event the job  possibility  did  not
         materialise; he went for a trip/holiday in any event.

     11. The sponsor is  employed  (and  has  been  since  May  2011)  as  a
         maintenance control manager for Jet2.com and is responsible for  11
         staff charged with the day to day maintenance of 44 aircraft. He is
         only permitted 2 consecutive weeks leave at any one time because of
         his onerous responsibilities. From his P60 he earned almost �71,000
         for  the  year  2014/15.  From  enquiries  made  of   similar   job
         opportunities in Hong Kong available at the  moment  with  airlines
         based in Hong Kong he does not meet the requirements either because
         he does not speak Chinese (written and spoken) or does not have the
         required licences. He owns a house in Middlewich, which is  subject
         to a mortgage of �345 per month and rented out at a  rent  of  �550
         per month. He and the appellant live in rented accommodation paying
         rent of �550 per month.

     12. The appellant and her husband made enquiries  as  to  accommodation
         availability in Hong Kong in the area where most expatriates  live.
         From the undisputed evidence a one bedroom flat  would  be  in  the
         region of HK$16500 to HK$50000 (�1367 -  �4143  approximately)  per
         month depending on the area.

     13. The appellant is involved in various community activities and has a
         great deal of support from friends in the area.

     14. The sponsor has a heart problem - he had a  stroke  in  1988  which
         resulted in damage to his mitral valve which was replaced in  1999.
         In 2006 that valve was again replaced. He takes warfarin and  three
         other medications which are checked monthly by way of  blood  tests
         and has an annual hospital check-up. He does not pay  for  this  in
         the UK, such treatment being provided by the NHS.

     15. 'Platinum' medical insurance covering both inpatient and outpatient
         treatment in Hong Kong is available at the approximate cost of �300
         to  �550  per  month.  Pre-existing  conditions  ie  cardiovascular
         disease/disorder or any associated  conditions  are  excluded.  The
         cost of treatment on an incident by incident basis  for  diagnostic
         services was not provided but an outpatient consultation  would  be
         in the region of HK$680 to  HK$2160  per  attendance  (which  would
         presumably be the equivalent of the  annual  check  up).  Community
         health services for eligible persons (which the sponsor is not) are
         HK$64 per treatment.

      5. It is plain that the sponsor would not be able to obtain employment
         in Hong Kong at a commensurate level to that in the UK although  it
         was accepted by Mr Bazini that it is likely that he would find some
         kind of employment; we were not provided with  any  detail  of  the
         likely income he could expect from such  employment.  It  does  not
         appear that the appellant has worked whilst in the UK but  she  has
         studied and speaks English. It is not  clear  what  employment  she
         undertook whilst in Hong Kong, if any,  although  because  she  was
         able to fund her trip to the UK and fund studies in the  UK  it  is
         reasonable to assume (given her evidence that her  family  in  Hong
         Kong are unable to provide any financial assistance) that  she  had
         some kind of employment. Furthermore it  is  reasonable  to  assume
         that having gained qualifications in the UK she  will  be  able  to
         find some employment. It does not appear that the couple  have  any
         savings.

      6. It is clear that  the  sponsor  requires  medical  treatment  on  a
         regular  basis.  Although  it  was   submitted   that   there   was
         considerable concern about the risk from infection  that  may  need
         intensive treatment, there was no evidence that this  had  occurred
         during the past few years and it is difficult to  extrapolate  from
         that generalised un-evidenced concern to a finding that these kinds
         of incident would be more likely to occur in  Hong  Kong.  We  have
         disregarded that submission in reaching our conclusion but  in  any
         event we consider that it carries little weight given the  lack  of
         any supporting medical evidence. Although  the  sponsor  cannot  be
         described as a fit young healthy man, it is plain that  his  health
         is managed and the need for medical treatment on an  intensive  and
         on-going basis is not acute. On the other hand it is  correct  that
         he would have to pay  for  all  treatment  received  in  Hong  Kong
         arising out  of  his  heart  problems.  Although  evidence  of  the
         diagnostic costs was not produced, it appears that community health
         services for eligible persons are HK$64 per treatment.  It  is  not
         possible from the evidence produced  to  assess  how  much  monthly
         diagnostic blood tests would cost but it seems to be safe to assume
         his monthly costs could be (generously) in the  region  of  HK$1000
         (approximately �85) per month. To conclude otherwise would  require
         evidence, which has not been produced.

      7. The sponsor owns a house which is currently  rented  out.  Although
         his evidence was that it would be difficult to sell because of  the
         current market, it is currently producing an income and there is no
         reason to suppose that it would not continue to do so. The costs of
         continuing to hold that property in the UK would not therefore fall
         upon him if he were to leave the UK and  there  would  be  a  small
         income from the rent, as now.

      8. Although the sponsor  and  the  appellant  see  his  family  fairly
         regularly it is plain that the ties that exist are no more than the
         normal family ties. Although it  is  accepted  that  the  sponsor's
         intended employment in New Zealand was not intended to be permanent
         and, from the documentation it appears it would  have  been  for  a
         maximum of a year, there was no indication  that  the  scarcity  of
         visits over that period would  have  caused  undue  upset  for  his
         family (or indeed that  the  lack  of  free  medical  cover  caused
         anxiety). In so far as the Down Syndrome child is concerned,  there
         are other family members who clearly see him as  frequently  as  do
         the appellant and her  husband  -  if  not  more  so.  Neither  the
         appellant nor the sponsor play any role  in  his  day-to-day  care;
         their contact is restricted to social family visits.  It  was  said
         that the child (or young man as he now is) would not understand why
         he was no longer seeing  them  but  this  does  not  seem  to  have
         concerned the family when the sponsor  was  considering  travelling
         abroad for a year. There was  no  indication  in  the  papers  that
         having travelled to Hong Kong, the sponsor at least  would  not  be
         able to return for visits during the year.  There was  no  evidence
         of the particular level of disability or learning  disability  that
         this young man suffers from. There was only an  assertion  that  he
         would not understand. Without more evidence we cannot accept either
         that the appellant and her husband  play  anything  other  than  an
         occasional social role in his life or that he would be particularly
         affected by their absence.

      9. Although we note that the couple live in a two bedroom rented  flat
         at present, we were given no information why it would be  necessary
         for such accommodation in Hong Kong.  From  the  evidence  produced
         they would be able to find suitable one bedroom accommodation in an
         area of Hong Kong that 'ex-pats' live in at a minimum of �1400 rent
         per month.

    Discussion

     10. The appellant submits  that  she  meets  the  requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules but if not then she falls  to  be  successful  on
         Article 8 ECHR grounds. It was submitted that she  would  not  meet
         the requirements for entry clearance under the Immigration Rules as
         a spouse because of her criminal conviction; that if she were to be
         removed that would in practice mean the termination of her and  her
         husband's relationship because he could not go to  Hong  Kong  with
         her: firstly because there were insurmountable obstacles because of
         his health and the financial difficulties and secondly that in  any
         event because all the factors in their circumstances rendered  such
         relocation disproportionate.

     11. It is clear that the most significant factor in this appeal is  the
         sponsor's general health requirements which have to be met  through
         payment in Hong Kong and yet are provided free of charge in the UK.
         There was no suggestion  that  the  level  of  treatment  he  would
         receive in Hong Kong was substandard or  not  at  the  standard  he
         could  expect  in  the  UK.  This  together  with   the   financial
         difficulties the couple may have on  relocating  to  Hong  Kong,  a
         country with which the sponsor has no link or knowledge other  than
         through his wife and where it is likely that  he  would  have  some
         difficulty obtaining employment although he would be likely to find
         something, combine and factor into the health  issues.   The  other
         factors set out above in paragraphs 5 to  10  above  are  obviously
         relevant  for  consideration  in  the  round  but  the  identifying
         features that put this  case  in  a  different  position  to  those
         generally are those noted in this paragraph. We have noted that the
         couple's relationship started whilst the appellant was lawfully  in
         the UK but that at  that  time  it  was  not  a  relationship  that
         appeared to be with a focus of it being long term. Her lawful leave
         had expired by the time the couple started  living  together  in  a
         relationship akin to marriage and subsequently married.

    Under the Immigration Rules

     12. There was no challenge to the ability of the appellant to meet  the
         generality of the Immigration Rules.  The  issue  was  whether  she
         meets paragraph EX.1. which reads as follows, where relevant:

             '(b) the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
             with a partner who is in the UK  and  is  a  British  Citizen,
             settled in  the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
             humanitarian  protection,   and   there   are   insurmountable
             obstacles to family life with that partner continuing  outside
             the UK.

             EX.2. For the purposes of paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
             obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which would
             be faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their
             family life together outside the UK and  which  could  not  be
             overcome or would entail very  significant  hardship  for  the
             applicant of the partner.'

     13. There was no dispute  but  that  the  couple  have  a  genuine  and
         subsisting  relationship,  meet  the  financial  and  accommodation
         requirements  and  the  only  question  was  whether   there   were
         "insurmountable obstacles" to family life  continuing  outside  the
         UK.

     14. We have taken very great account of the medical issues in this case
         including the sponsor's age and general level  of  health  and  the
         financial constraints the couple will be likely to  face  at  least
         when they initially return to Hong Kong. Although we appreciate and
         acknowledge that these  would  amount  to  difficulties  we  cannot
         accept that they would entail very significant or even  significant
         hardship for the appellant or her partner. Our assessment  of  this
         does not include the fact that as a British Citizen he is  entitled
         to free medical treatment but the likely reality of  the  situation
         they would  face  in  Hong  Kong  -  smaller  accommodation,  lower
         standard of living and having to pay for health care. We find  that
         there  would  not  be  insurmountable  obstacles  to   the   couple
         continuing their family life outside the UK and thus find that  the
         appellant does not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

    Article 8 and proportionality

     15. It was not disputed that we should undertake a  more  wide  ranging
         assessment of proportionality than  under  the  Rules.  There  were
         issues that were not adequately covered by the First-tier  Tribunal
         judge in such a "Rules based" consideration including the sponsor's
         health, his age and financial issues. Our consideration of this  is
         guided by Strasbourg jurisprudence and  s117B  of  the  Nationality
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Although the  public  interest  is
         statutorily enshrined in s117B  these  factors  are  not  the  only
         factors to be considered but they form a bedrock for consideration.
         There is no "exceptionality test" but there  is  a  requirement  to
         carry out a balancing exercise where an individual cannot meet  the
         requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The  public  interest  will
         generally  only  be  outweighed  if  an  applicant  can  show  that
         "compelling circumstances" exist - see [40] to [42] of  SS  (Congo)
         [2015] EWCA Civ 387.  The test is, we agree, at a  lower  threshold
         than that set out in paragraph EX.1.(b) and does not  require  that
         there be insurmountable obstacles.

     16. In considering the balancing exercise the Tribunal is  required  to
         consider s117B of the 2002 Act. There is no dispute  but  that  the
         appellant speaks English  and  is  financially  independent.  S117B
         requires that little weight should be placed  upon  a  relationship
         formed with a qualifying partner  that  is  established  while  the
         applicant is unlawfully in the UK. This appellant was  lawfully  in
         the UK when their 'relationship' commenced in the sense  that  they
         knew each other. By the time the relationship commenced in terms of
         her husband being a qualifying partner, however, she was unlawfully
         in the UK; thus as required by statue we must place  little  weight
         upon that relationship.

     17. Mr Bazini submitted that the appellant would not, if  removed  from
         the UK be able to successfully apply for entry clearance because of
         her criminal conviction. Although that is correct as of the date of
         hearing before us, the eligibility criteria in the Rules being that
         the applicant would not meet the criteria  until  five  years  have
         elapsed  after  the  conclusion  of  her  sentence  ie  July   2016
         (paragraph S-EC.1.4(c))  and  it  would  "only  be  in  exceptional
         circumstances that the public interest in maintaining refusal  will
         be outweighed by compelling factors". Obviously we cannot speculate
         as to the appellant's financial and accommodation  status  at  that
         time in the future but it is not the fact that there  is  a  likely
         long term bar to her re-entry in the event that she otherwise meets
         the Immigration Rules. We note  in  reaching  our  conclusion  that
         during this period the couple would be able to meet up although the
         sponsor cannot take more than two weeks holiday at anyone time. One
         week's holiday appears to equate to four shifts and he is  entitled
         to a total of 28  shifts  per  annum  holiday,  to  include  public
         holidays. This amounts to 7 weeks holiday.

     18. We have also noted that the respondent did not consider deportation
         proceedings against the appellant although we also  note  that  the
         respondent wrote to  her  on  her  release  from  imprisonment  and
         informed her that she should seek to regularise her stay or she was
         expected to provide details of an application for leave  to  remain
         having been made.

     19. Mr Bazini submitted that unless  the  appellant  had  an  appalling
         immigration history then there was no reason why she  should  leave
         the UK in order to apply for entry  clearance  -  Chikwamba  [2008]
         UKHL 40 which in paragraph 44 held "... Rather it seems to me  that
         only comparatively rarely,  certainly  in  family  cases  involving
         children, should an Article 8 appeal be dismissed on the basis that
         it would be proportionate and more appropriate for the appellant to
         apply for leave from abroad ...". In  Hayat  (nature  of  Chikwamba
         principle) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00444 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held

             "The significance of Chikwamba v SSHD [2008]  UKHL  40  is  to
             make it plain that, in appeals where the only matter  weighing
             on the respondent's  side  of  an  Article  8  proportionality
             balance is the public policy of requiring an application to be
             made under the immigration rules from abroad, that  legitimate
             objective will usually be outweighed by factors resting on the
             appellant's side of the balance. The  Chikwamba  principle  is
             not confined to cases where children are involved or where the
             person with whom  the  appellant  is  seeking  to  remain  has
             settled status in the United Kingdom."

     20. In R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary of State for the Home
         Department) (Appendix FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary  separation  -
         proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189  (IAC),  albeit  a  judicial
         review, the Upper Tribunal held:

             "Appendix FM does not include consideration  of  the  question
             whether it would be disproportionate to expect  an  individual
             to return to his home  country  to  make  an  entry  clearance
             application to re-join family members in the U.K. There may be
             cases in which there are no insurmountable obstacles to family
             life being  enjoyed  outside  the  U.K.  but  where  temporary
             separation to enable an individual to make an application  for
             entry clearance may be disproportionate. In all cases, it will
             be for the individual to place before the Secretary  of  State
             evidence  that  such  temporary  separation   will   interfere
             disproportionately with  protected  rights.  It  will  not  be
             enough to rely solely upon the case-law concerning Chikwamba v
             SSHD [2008] UKHL 40."

     21. Although some considerable time has elapsed  since  the  respondent
         was made aware of the relationship between the  appellant  and  her
         husband, this is  not  such  as  to  impact  either  in  favour  or
         adversely upon our decision.

     22. We have considerable sympathy for the appellant and her husband  in
         this appeal. We do not accept  that  the  lack  of  an  'appalling'
         immigration history on  the  part  of  the  appellant  renders  her
         removal disproportionate. Consideration of the  proportionality  of
         removal requires all factors to be taken into  account.  There  are
         factors that militate against her not least that  her  relationship
         commenced when she was  unlawfully  in  the  UK  and  her  criminal
         offence  which,  although  considered  insufficient  to  cause  the
         instigation of deportation proceedings is  still  a  factor  to  be
         weighed against her. We do accept that her husband will  have  some
         difficulties in Hong Kong and that as a British Citizen he would be
         prevented from utilising the NHS for required treatment  whilst  he
         was there but we do not accept that  these  difficulties  are  such
         that they render the appellant's removal disproportionate.

     23. We have carefully considered  all  of  the  factors  both  for  and
         adverse to the appellant and weighed these  in  the  light  of  the
         public interest on  removal.  We  find  that  her  removal  is  not
         disproportionate and dismiss her appeal.

    Conclusions:

    The First-tier Tribunal erred in law such  that  the  decision  is  set
    aside to be remade.

    We re-make the decision.

    The appeal against the decision to remove is dismissed.

    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  There
    was no application for one and we see no reason why one should be made.
