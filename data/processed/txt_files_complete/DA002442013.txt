                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

This appeal comes before us following a grant of permission to appeal on  25
June 2013.

The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe, born on 24 April 1982. He claims  to
have entered the United Kingdom in 2000 using his own passport and  to  have
been granted six months leave to enter as a  visitor.  He  remained  in  the
United Kingdom thereafter without leave.

On 25 June 2003 he was convicted of breach of a community  punishment  order
for which he received a fine of ï¿½50. On 25 July 2005  he  was  convicted  of
various offences committed between December 2003 and June 2005, as  follows:
failing to surrender to custody on 8 January 2004 for which  he  received  a
two week sentence of imprisonment; restricting or  obstructing  a  constable
on 5 June 2005 for which he received a one month sentence  of  imprisonment;
failing to surrender to custody on 14 June 2005 for which he received a  one
month sentence of imprisonment; driving a motor vehicle with excess  alcohol
on 27 April 2005 for which he received a sentence  of  imprisonment  of  two
months; driving a motor vehicle with excess  alcohol  on  6  June  2005  for
which he received a sentence of imprisonment of four  months;  and  using  a
motor vehicle with excess alcohol on 18 December 2003 for which he  received
a sentence of imprisonment of one month.

On 26 May 2006 the appellant was convicted at Basildon Crown Court on  three
counts of supplying class A controlled drugs,  namely  cocaine  and  heroin,
for which he was sentenced to two years and one month  imprisonment.  On  25
July 2006 he was convicted of failure to surrender  to  custody  on  10  May
2005 for which he was sentenced to one month imprisonment concurrent.

On 9 October 2006 a decision was made  to  deport  the  appellant  from  the
United Kingdom, against which he appealed. His appeal was dismissed  as  out
of time on 24 October 2006. On 19 December  2006  a  deportation  order  was
signed against the appellant and served on him on 21 December 2006.

On 1  April  2009  written  representations  were  made  on  behalf  of  the
appellant  requesting  that  the  deportation  order  be  revoked.  It   was
submitted that it would be irrational and unreasonable for the Secretary  of
State to implement removal, given the passage of time since the  deportation
order had been made, since when the appellant had been granted bail and  had
complied with the conditions of bail. In addition,  it  was  submitted  that
deportation would breach Article 8 of the ECHR in view  of  the  appellant's
ongoing relationship since September 2005 with a  British  citizen,  Carolyn
Mairs, with whom he had been living since April  2007.  Reference  was  made
also to his close relationship with Ms Mairs' family, to  the  problems  his
mother had faced in Zimbabwe and his lack of knowledge of  her  whereabouts,
to the risk of returning to Zimbabwe  as  a  person  unable  to  demonstrate
loyalty to Zanu-PF and to the fact that  he  had,  since  his  release  from
detention, enrolled on and completed various courses.

The appellant was invited to, and attended  a  screening  interview  and  an
asylum interview on 11 May 2010 and was subsequently invited,  in  September
2012, to complete a questionnaire. On 24 October 2012 he was informed  about
the intention to exclude him from the protection of the  Refugee  Convention
pursuant to Article 33(2) and section 72  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
and Asylum Act 2002. He was  invited  to  rebut  the  presumption  that  his
continued presence in the United Kingdom would constitute a  danger  to  the
community.

On 16 January 2013 a decision was made to refuse to revoke  the  deportation
order. The respondent noted the  statements  submitted  in  support  of  the
appellant's case by his partner and her parents and took  into  account  his
educational qualifications and character references. It was  noted  that  he
had been offered employment with  a  company  for  whom  he  had  undertaken
voluntary work. However the respondent concluded  that  section  72  of  the
2002 Act applied to him and certified that  the  presumption  under  section
72(2) applied. He was  accordingly  excluded  from  the  protection  of  the
Refugee Convention and,  likewise,  from  humanitarian  protection.  It  was
considered in any event that he would not  be  at  any  risk  on  return  to
Zimbabwe. It was not accepted that he had no contact with his mother and  it
was considered that he had family  remaining  in  Zimbabwe.  His  claim  was
accordingly refused under Article 3 of the ECHR. With regard to  Article  8,
the  respondent  considered  that  the  appellant   could   not   meet   the
requirements of paragraphs 399 or 399A of  the  immigration  rules.  It  was
accepted that he was in a subsisting relationship with his  British  partner
but any interference with his family and private life was not considered  to
be in breach of his Article 8 rights.

Appeal before the First-tier Tribunal

The appellant's appeal against that decision was  heard  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal on 9 May 2013, before a panel  consisting  of  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Morris and  Mr  S  Percy.  The  panel  were  not  satisfied  that  the
appellant had rebutted the presumption under section 72  of  the  2002  Act.
They considered that he would not be at risk on return to Zimbabwe and  they
dismissed his appeal on asylum, humanitarian protection and Article 3  human
rights grounds. It was conceded on behalf of the  appellant  that  he  could
not meet the requirements of  paragraph  339(a)  and  (b)  or  399A  of  the
immigration rules. With respect to Article 8, the  panel  accepted  that  he
had established a family and private life in  the  United  Kingdom.  However
they concluded that the factors in his favour were outweighed by the  public
interest in his deportation and they accordingly  dismissed  the  appeal  on
that basis.

Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  sought  on  the  following
grounds: that the  panel  had  wrongly  applied  the  automatic  deportation
provisions under section 32(5) of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007  rather  than
applying paragraph 390 of the immigration rules regarding  revocation  of  a
deportation order; that they had failed to make a proper assessment of  risk
of re-offending; that they had reached  an  erroneous  conclusion  that  the
appellant had failed to rebut the section 72 presumption that  he  presented
a danger to the community; and that they had taken an erroneous approach  to
the Article 8 balancing exercise with respect to the weight attributable  to
family life and to the period of time that had elapsed since the  making  of
the deportation order.

In granting permission to appeal on 25 June 2013,  First-tier  Judge  Coates
found all grounds to be arguable.

Appeal before the Upper Tribunal

 The appeal came before us on 31 July 2013.  We  heard  submissions  on  the
error of law.

 Ms Daykin expanded upon the grounds of appeal. With  regard  to  the  first
ground, she submitted that the panel had failed to apply  the  correct  test
relating to revocation of a deportation order and  had  instead  erroneously
applied the provisions relating to automatic  deportation.  With  regard  to
the second ground, they had failed to make  any  findings  on  risk  of  re-
offending. Their findings at paragraph 41 of  their  determination  did  not
amount to an assessment of risk and  had  been  made  on  the  basis  of  an
assessment by the probation services dating back to 2007.  The  question  of
risk had not been put into the balancing exercise  properly.  The  same  was
relevant to ground 3 with  respect  to  their  findings  in  regard  to  the
presumption under section 72 of the 2002 Act. With regard to  ground  4  the
panel had failed to consider the positive aspects of the appellant's  family
and private life and the fact that there had been no attempt  to  carry  out
the deportation order for several years. Their findings suggested that  they
were expecting his partner to have ended the  relationship  because  of  his
convictions.  The  last  sentence  of  paragraph  44  of  the  determination
suggested that they had considered the appellant's family and  private  life
to have carried no weight.

Mr Avery, in response, submitted that the panel had not  applied  the  wrong
test but were entitled to consider current legislation and to  take  account
of the Secretary of State's  expression  of  the  public  interest  and  the
provisions for deportation as set out under section 32 of the 2007 Act.  The
second ground, he submitted, was a disagreement with  the  panel's  findings
on risk of re-offending and, in making their findings, they  had  considered
the  appellant's  period  of  good  behaviour  and  the   recent   probation
assessment. With regard to the third ground, the section 72 certificate  was
not material to the outcome, and in any event  the  panel  adequately  dealt
with the matter. They were entitled to find that the appellant was a  danger
to the community, as class A drugs offences were serious. As  to  ground  4,
there was no need for the panel to make findings  on  the  evidence  of  the
appellant's partner and her parents as they had accepted  that  family  life
existed. They did not suggest that his partner  should  have  given  up  the
relationship but were simply applying relevant case law. With regard to  the
length of time since the  deportation  order  had  been  made,  it  was  not
surprising that the appellant  had  not  been  removed  earlier,  given  the
fluctuation in the position of the courts in respect to Zimbabwe.

Ms Daykin responded by reiterating the points made previously.

Consideration and findings.

In our view the panel did not make any error of law in their decision.

With regard to the first ground we note  the  reference  by  the  panel,  at
paragraph  21  of  their  determination,  to   the   automatic   deportation
provisions in section 32(5) of the 2007 Act and  the  suggestion  that  that
indicated a failure to apply the correct test relating to the revocation  of
a deportation order. However we find merit in  Mr  Avery's  submission  that
the panel were  entitled  to  consider  the  relevant  legislation  and  the
expression, by the Secretary of State, of her policy at  the  current  time,
when the decision was made to revoke the deportation order. The  panel  were
plainly aware that  this  was  a  revocation  case  and  they  set  out  the
appropriate legal framework at paragraph 10 of their determination.

The grounds do not, in any case, suggest that the panel  thereby  failed  to
take account of any relevant factors in their findings.  It  is  clear  from
the grounds of appeal before them, included at pages 16 to 18 of the  appeal
bundle, that the appellant's case was  pursued  before  them  on  Article  8
grounds, on the basis of his family and private life,  with  asylum  grounds
set out in  the  supplementary  grounds  at  pages  19  to  21.  Those  were
precisely the grounds upon which the panel considered the appellant's  case.
There was certainly nothing before them to indicate any further  basis  upon
which the appellant's case was being pursued relevant to  paragraph  390  of
the  immigration  rules  such  as  particular  compassionate  circumstances.
Accordingly the grounds  before  us  fail  to  demonstrate  that  the  panel
applied the wrong test or that, in referring to the provisions of  automatic
deportation, they considered matters not relevant to  the  appellant's  case
or failed to consider relevant factors.

We also concur with Mr Avery's view that ground 2  amounts  to  little  more
than a disagreement with the panel's findings with respect to  the  risk  of
re-offending. At paragraph 36 of their  determination  they  considered  the
strong public interest  in  the  protection  of  the  public  by  preventing
further offending and in deterring others from committing similar  offences.
They noted the seriousness of the offence. At paragraph 37 they went  on  to
consider  the  risk  of  re-offending,  taking  particular   note   of   the
appellant's history of offending over the period 2001  to  2006,  commencing
shortly after his arrival in the United Kingdom.

The panel then went on, at paragraph 38, to  consider  factors  weighing  in
the appellant's favour, taking into account in particular the reports of  26
November 2007 and 9 March 2013 from the probation services.  They  noted  at
paragraph 41 that the latter referred to the risk assessment at the time  of
his licence period in 2007/8 and was based on the  assumption  that  he  had
been law-abiding since his licence expired in 2008 given  that  he  had  not
come to their attention since then. Most significantly they  considered,  at
paragraph 41, the passage of time since the deportation order was  made  and
the appellant's behaviour and  lack  of  offending  since  that  time.  They
considered relevant case law in that respect,  namely  A.A.  v.  the  United
Kingdom - 8000/08 [2011] ECHR 1345, and applied the principles in that  case
to  the  appellant's  own  circumstances,  but   identified   distinguishing
features in his case, namely the  previous  risk  assessment,  his  criminal
history and the fact that he had committed the offences as an adult. On  the
basis of all those considerations they concluded that  the  appellant  could
"reasonably  be  expected  to  cause  disorder  or  to  engage  in  criminal
activities such as to  render  his  deportation  necessary",  mirroring  the
wording used at paragraph  63  of  the  judgment  in  AA.  Contrary  to  the
assertion made in the grounds of appeal, it is plain  that  the  panel  gave
careful consideration to all matters relevant to the  risk  of  re-offending
and undertook a detailed assessment of risk. They  were  entitled  to  reach
the findings that they did.

We make the same finding in regard to  the  third  ground  of  appeal  which
amounts,  in  essence,  to  the  same  point,  albeit  in  relation  to  the
presumption under section 72 of the 2002 Act. The panel properly  identified
that the test was a two-stage one and that it  had  to  be  established  not
only that the appellant had been convicted of a particularly serious  crime,
but also that he was a danger to the community. At  paragraph  17  of  their
determination they found that he was a danger to the  community  and  in  so
doing referred to the findings  that  were  to  follow,  which  was  clearly
intended as a reference to their findings on risk  of  re-offending.  Again,
for the reasons given above, they were  entitled  to  reach  the  conclusion
they did. In any event, as Mr Avery submitted, the findings  on  section  72
were not material, given that it was considered that the appellant  was  not
in fact at risk  on  return  to  Zimbabwe  and  was  thus  not  entitled  to
protection under the  Refugee  Convention  or  to  humanitarian  protection,
findings not challenged before the Upper Tribunal.

With regard to the fourth ground, the panel were not  required  to  set  out
the evidence of the witnesses in detail, given that  there  was  no  dispute
that family and private life had been established.  The  panel  referred  to
their evidence as necessary and were entitled to consider the  circumstances
of the relationships and the fact that they had developed in  the  knowledge
of the appellant's criminal history and whilst he was in the United  Kingdom
illegally. Indeed, at paragraph 39 they noted that the members of the  Mairs
family had been willing to turn a "blind-eye" to the  appellant's  offences.
The grounds assert that the panel were, in so  doing,  suggesting  that  the
witnesses were wrong to develop the relationships in such circumstances  and
accordingly placed little weight upon them. However that was not  what  they
were doing: as Mr Avery  submitted,  it  is  plain  that  they  were  simply
applying the principles and guidance in relevant case  law,  to  which  they
specifically referred at paragraph  44,  in  regard  to  the  weight  to  be
accorded to the family and  private  life.  The  panel  considered  at  some
length the appellant's behaviour and activities since  being  released  from
detention and the significant period of time  that  had  elapsed  since  the
deportation order was made without being implemented  and  plainly  accorded
this weight in the balancing exercise. We are mindful of the fluctuation  in
the position  of  the  courts  in  relation  to  removals  to  Zimbabwe,  as
submitted by Mr Avery, which may  well  have  impacted  upon  the  delay  in
implementing the deportation order, although we note that  that  was  not  a
matter that was put to the panel.

In any event, the panel were ultimately entitled to place  the  weight  that
they did upon the appellant's lack of lawful status in the  United  Kingdom,
his contradictory evidence about his family circumstances in  Zimbabwe,  his
history of offending commencing within a year  of  arriving  in  the  United
Kingdom and the seriousness of his most  recent  offence,  and  to  conclude
that the balance fell in favour of the public interest in  his  deportation.
That was a conclusion that was open to them on the evidence before them.  As
such we do not find that they made any errors of law in their decision.

DECISION

 The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  an
error on a point of law. We do not set aside their  decision.  The  decision
to dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  refusal  to  revoke  the
deportation order therefore stands.
