Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr H Sarwar, Counsel instructed by Biruntha
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka.  He claims  to  have  entered
    the UK in 2008.  On 24 April 2009 he was granted discretionary leave as
    an unaccompanied asylum seeker child.  That leave expired in April 2012
    when he became 17�  years  old.   He  has  permission  to  challenge  a
    decision of First-tier Tribunal (FtT) Judge Carroll sent  on  8  August
    2016 dismissing his appeal against a decision made by the respondent on
    5 July 2016  refusing  to  grant  asylum,  humanitarian  protection  or
    further leave on human rights grounds.

2.   The  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  do  not  challenge  the  judge's
    negative findings on the asylum and humanitarian protection grounds but
    focus exclusively on the judge's handling of  the  Article  8  grounds.
    They submit that the judge erred in:

         (a)      failing  to  apply  the   Immigration   Rules,   paragraph
             276ADE(1)(vi);
         (b)    failing to apply a proportionately assessment  incorporating
             an analysis of obstacles to the appellant's  (re)  integration
             (it is said that the  judge  wrongly  confined  focus  to  the
             appellant's (lack of) ties in the UK); and
         (c)    failing to consider the issue of delay of three  years  nine
             months in the respondent making a decision on the  application
             for discretionary leave submitted on 4 April 2012.


3.   I am persuaded that the judge's decision contains certain  errors,  but
    not that they singly or cumulatively amount to material errors of law.

4.   It is true that the FtT judge gave only short treatment  to  Article  8
    considerations.   The judge said was the following at paragraph 17:

         "17. The appellant's Counsel sought to argue  that  return  to  Sri
             Lanka would give rise to a breach of Article  8  of  the  1950
             Convention in the context of  the  appellant's  private  life.
             The  evidence  as  to  his  private  life  contained  in   the
             appellant's bundle is, to say the least, scant and I sought to
             clarify this evidence with him.  The appellant  said  that  he
             works part-time (four days a week) at a  BP  garage  and  that
             previously he was the leasehold owner of a corner  shop  which
             he sold three months ago (having brought the lease for �25,000
             and sold it for  �39,000).   I  note  that  I  have  heard  no
             evidence  from  any  friends,  family  members  or   community
             organisations in support of the appellant's claim.  There  is,
             in fact, no evidence to show that, if the appellant return  to
             Sri Lanka, he would be unable to  continue  with  his  private
             life in respect  of  all  its  essential  elements  and  I  am
             satisfied  as  to  the  proportionality  of  the  respondent's
             decision under appeal."

5.   However, the respondent in her reasons for refusal addressed Article  8
    aspects of the appellant's claim at paragraphs 27-57, first considering
    eligibility under the Rules (including paragraph 276ADE) and  then  his
    circumstances outside the Rules.  When appealing against this  decision
    the appellant did not bring any grounds connected to  Article  8.   The
    appellant's Counsel did raise Article 8 at the hearing by reference  to
    a bundle which included a witness statement.  However, even though in a
    short paragraph, the judge specifically noted that  he  had  regard  to
    background and in view of it being, 'scant' as regards his private life
    ties, "I sought to clarify this evidence with him".   In  this  context
    the judge was clearly concerned to examine and did examine whether  the
    appellant had provided a proper evidential foundation for his Article 8
    claim and whether the appellant had  satisfactorily  responded  to  the
    respondent's concerns which included the fact that the appellant in his
    asylum claim and interview identified that he had family in Sri  Lanka.



6.   A second fatal difficulty is that the judge  did  not,  in  any  event,
    hinge his rejection of the Article 8 claim  on  lack  or  otherwise  of
    family ties in Sri Lanka.  In [17] he hinged it  on  his  private  life
    prospects: his conclusion - that "[t]here is, in fact, no  evidence  to
    show that, if the appellant returns to Sri Lanka, he would be unable to
    continue with his private life in respect of all its essential elements
    ..." was properly directed to the fact that the appellant had no family
    life ties in the UK and so was reliant solely on  claimed  interference
    with his right to respect for private life.

7.   What I have said above suffices to deal with  the  argument  raised  in
    the second ground, that the judge did not address  whether  there  were
    "very significant obstacles to integration".  On the judge's assessment
    the appellant had not shown he lacked family ties in Sri Lanka  and  in
    any event had not shown that there would be very significant  obstacles
    in the way of his integration in  Sri  Lanka  in  the  context  of  his
    private life.

8.   As regards the third ground, it is true again that the  judge  did  not
    specifically address the factor of delay.  Although no point was raised
    regarding  delay,  it  was  raised  in  Counsel's  skeleton   argument.
    However, (1) as Mr Sarwar conceded, that skeleton  argument  relied  on
    unsustainable arguments concerning Home Office policy on  discretionary
    leave and on an untenable claim based on "legitimate expectation".

9.   To the extent nevertheless that implicit within  this  argument  was  a
    discrete point about delay based on EB (Kosovo) principles,  I  do  not
    consider that the judge's failure to address it (albeit an error) could
    have made any material difference.  In the first place, the  respondent
    considered the issue of delay both in the context of  the  respondent's
    policy regarding discretionary leave to unaccompanied minors and in its
    own right (see paragraphs 48 and 67-68  of  the  respondent's  decision
    letter).   The  respondent's  reasoning  in  her  refusal   letter   at
    paragraphs 68 and 69 was that:

         "I have no evidence to suggest that this [delay] has impacted  your
         life in a way that  would  disadvantage  you  upon  return  to  Sri
         Lanka";


     (and at 69):

         "It is deduced from the lack of supporting evidence that you do not
         have any strong connections or ties in the UK".

10.  The appellant raised no objection to these reasons in the  grounds  and
    in  Counsel's  skeleton  argument  failed  to  identify  any   specific
    disadvantage the delay  had  caused  the  appellant.   Indeed,  on  the
    evidence, one can only conclude that the three years nine months  delay
    certainly afforded the appellant every opportunity  to  strengthen  his
    ties, but that  clearly  he  did  not  utilise  that  opportunity.   In
    addition, the period concerned is below that which has  generally  been
    seen as excessive: see e.g. FH (Iraq).

11.  For the above reasons the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not  materially
    err in law.  His decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal is upheld.

No anonymity direction is made.
