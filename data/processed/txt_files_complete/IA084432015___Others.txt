                                                                   Appellant

                                                                  Respondent
                       NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL OF APPEAL

By e-mail dated  9  June  2016  the  appellant,  by  her  Senior  Presenting
Officer, Mr S Kotas, informed the Tribunal that the Secretary  of  State  no
longer wanted to pursue her appeal because, if an error of law by the First-
tier Tribunal was established the appeal would  have  to  be  decided  again
but, because of a change of circumstances, it would now succeed.

Pursuant to rule 17(2) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
2008 I give permission to the appellant to withdraw her appeal.

This is a Notice pursuant to rule 17(5) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008 to the parties that the  appeal  is  withdrawn  at  the
appellant's request and with the permission of the Upper Tribunal.

The parties are reminded that withdrawn appeals can sometimes be  reinstated
under rule 17(3) of the Rules.
