                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                 Respondents


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondents are citizens of Pakistan. Each appealed to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal ("FtT") against decisions of the SSHD, made on 20  August
    2014, refusing them leave to remain.  Those  appeals  were  allowed  by
    First-tier Tribunal judge O'Brien in a decision of  21  May  2015.  The
    SSHD appealed to the Upper Tribunal and in a  decision  of  13  January
    2016 Judge Latter set aside the FtT's decision. The  re-making  of  the
    decision under appeal was adjourned, to  be  undertaken  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. By way of a letter of 23 September 2016 the SSHD indicates that the 3rd
    respondent  has  now  been  granted  British   citizenship.   The   3rd
    respondent's appeal must therefore be treated as abandoned.

 3. As a consequence of the  aforementioned  circumstances  the  SSHD  also
    indicates that she wishes to withdraw the  decisions  under  appeal  in
    relation to the remaining four respondents, with  a  view  to  granting
    each of them a period of leave.  The respondents' legal representatives
    have no objection to this course.

 4. The Secretary of State does not require the  permission  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal to withdraw a decision she has made, even if such decision  is
    the subject of the appeal before the Tribunal.  The withdrawal  of  the
    decision underlying  the  appeal  does  not,  however,  extinguish  the
    jurisdiction of the Upper Tribunal under section  12(2)(b)(ii)  of  the
    2007 Act to re-make the decision in the appeal brought under  the  2002
    Act: See SM (Withdrawal of appeal decision effect) Pakistan [2014] UKUT
    64 (IAC).

 5. Having had regard, inter alia, to the matters identified  in  paragraph
    72 of SM,  and  in  particular  observing  that  (i)  the  respondents'
    circumstances have  significantly  changed  since  the  last  time  the
    Secretary of State gave substantive consideration to their  cases  (ii)
    that the SSHD should, ordinarily, be the primary decision maker in  the
    immigration field and (iii) there are no matters of  general  legal  or
    procedural guidance to be addressed in this appeal I  conclude,  having
    also considered the  overriding  objective  in  the  2008  Rules,  that
    consent should be given the Secretary of State to withdraw her case.

 6. Following the reasoning of the Tribunal in SM, I must formally  dispose
    of this appeal. The normal course in such  circumstances  would  be  to
    dismiss the appeal, unless there are matters which points  towards  not
    doing so (SM - paragraph 72). In all the circumstances  of  this  case,
    and having taken into account the reasons provided  by  the  respondent
    for withdrawing her decisions i.e. to reconsider the respondents' cases
    with a view to granting leave, I conclude that  it  is  appropriate  to
    formally allow the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th respondents' appeals.  I  make
    clear however that this is no reflection on the merits of the  case  of
    either party and is no more than a formality to bring these proceedings
    to an end.



Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside  for  the  reasons
given by UTJ Latter

The 3rd respondent's appeal is treated as abandoned.

The 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th respondents' appeals are  formally  allowed,  such
conclusion having been reached  without  the  Upper  Tribunal  having  given
substantive consideration to the merits of the appeal.
