                                                                  Respondent

Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Gajjar, Counsel, Imperium Chambers

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as the Secretary of State  and  to  the
      respondent as the claimant.

   2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll, who allowed the  claimant's  appeal
      against the Secretary of State's decision to  refuse  her  application
      for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of ten years' residence.

   3. The claimant's application made on 8 May  2017,  was  refused  by  the
      Secretary of State pursuant to paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration
      Rules.  It  was  contended  that  the  information  she  submitted  in
      connection with her Tier 1 application  relating  to  self  employment
      earnings was significantly different  from  the  information  she  had
      declared to HMRC for self employment during the tax year 2010 to 2011.



   4. The explanation she has provided for her amended tax returns  was  not
      accepted. "... As there was such a large discrepancy, i.e. profit from
      self employment for tax years ending 2011 having been  amended  on  11
      November 2017 from �1,625 to �14,066, it is therefore  not  considered
      to be an acceptable or credible explanation....".  The fact  that  she
      retrospectively declared  these  claimed  earnings  to  HRMC  was  not
      sufficient to  satisfy  the  Secretary  of  State  that  she  had  not
      previously been deceitful or  dishonest  in  her  dealings  with  HMRC
      and/or UK visas and immigration [7].

   5. Judge Carroll set out the provisions of paragraph 322(5) of the  Rules
      - a discretionary provision  permitting  the  Secretary  of  State  to
      refuse an application. She set out the  Secretary  of  State's  policy
      guidance in relation to 322(5):

         "The main types of cases you need to  consider  for  refusal  under
         paragraph 322(5) or referral to other teams, are those that involve
         criminality, a threat to national security, war  crimes  or  travel
         bans.

         A person does not need to have been convicted of a criminal offence
         for this provision to apply. When deciding whether to refuse  under
         this category, the key thing to consider is if  there  is  reliable
         evidence to support a decision that the  person's  behaviour  calls
         into  question  their  character  and/or   conduct   and/or   their
         associations to the extent that it is undesirable to allow them  to
         enter or remain in the UK. This may include cases where  a  migrant
         has entered, attempted to enter or facilitated a sham  marriage  to
         evade immigration control".

   6. Copies of the figures originally submitted by  the  claimant  and  the
      amended figures subsequently submitted in 2017 were in  the  Secretary
      of State's  bundle.  Judge  Carroll  noted  that  there  was  a  clear
      discrepancy between the figure initially given  by  the  claimant  for
      profit, namely �1625 and the amended figure of �14,066 -  [11].  After
      submitting the application giving rise to the  decision  under  appeal
      the claimant was asked  by  the  Secretary  of  State  to  complete  a
      questionnaire which was produced in the Secretary of  State's  bundle.
      The claimant was asked a  number  of  questions  at  part  14  of  the
      questionnaire about the tax return for 2010/11, and  she  stated  that
      the confusion arose in part because the tax amount "... was  splitting
      into  two  years  (2009/10  -  2010/11)  so  that's  ended  with   few
      unintentional errors in the self assessment submission."

   7. The claimant went on to state  in  response  to  question  14(b)  that
      before submitting the application giving rise to  the  decision  under
      appeal she went to an immigration advisor and was told that she needed
      to get an SA302 and  her  employment  history  from  HMRC.  Once  that
      documentation was received, she was referred to an accountant and  she
      instructed that accountant to review her tax affairs.  The  accountant
      then found the discrepancy in the 2010/11 return and  advised  her  to
      contact HMRC to rectify the matter [12].

   8. It was only on 11 November 2017 that  she  submitted  a  revised  Self
      Assessment return. The Judge noted however that in  fact,  as  appears
      from the correspondence exhibited, the amended tax return was received
      by HMRC on 24 January 2017. In the same letter,  HMRC  apologised  for
      having taken so long to amend the self assessment tax return [13].

   9. Judge Carroll stated that no other issues arose in relation to any  of
      the subsequent tax returns submitted by the appellant and HMRC has not
      sought to impose any penalty upon her for the amendment [14].

  10. She was therefore satisfied in the light  of  all  the  evidence  that
      there was no deception on  behalf  of  the  appellant  in  failing  to
      declare all relevant income in the 2010/2011 tax return. She had taken
      all necessary steps to remedy the situation and HRMC  has  imposed  no
      penalty upon her. She has not been  involved  in  criminality  or  any
      conduct of the type referred to in the  Secretary  of  State's  policy
      guidance. She has never attempted to cover up the mistake made in  the
      tax return initially submitted and fully disclosed the information  to
      the Secretary of State in the questionnaire [15].

  11. The claimant also produced character references and evidence  relating
      to her employment. She has been  employed  since  January  2012  on  a
      permanent basis as a Deputy Network Manager at a health centre.

  12. She stated that no reason has been relied upon  by  the  Secretary  of
      State other than the discrepancy in the two tax returns when  refusing
      her application for indefinite leave to remain.

  13. She found that the Secretary of State's decision to  invoke  paragraph
      322(5) is inconsistent with her own policy guidance. The claimant  has
      been in the UK for ten years lawfully  and  continuously  and  in  the
      light of the evidence she concluded that the decision under appeal  is
      disproportionate. [18]

  14. On 28 November 2018, First-tier Tribunal  Judge  P  J  M  Hollingworth
      granted permission to appeal on the basis that the Judge had  arguably
      fallen into error by taking  into  account  the  fact  that  HMRC  had
      imposed no penalty upon the claimant. It is arguable that the  outcome
      has been affected.

  15. Mr Melvin on behalf of the Secretary of State submitted that the Judge
      erred in her approach and assessment as to whether  the  claimant  has
      acted dishonestly by placing significant emphasis  on  the  fact  that
      HMRC has not sought to impose any penalty upon her for  the  amendment
      or taken any action against her.

  16. He submitted that this approach  is  incorrect.  He  referred  to  two
      judicial review decisions from  the  Upper  Tribunal.  In  R  (on  the
      application of Samant) v SSHD [2017] UKAITUR JR 6546/2016 the Tribunal
      held that it seemed that in any given case, depending on  the  amounts
      and circumstances, HMRC may well decide that the  effort  in  reaching
      particular  conclusions  frankly  is  not   justified   in   all   the
      circumstances. The fact that HMRC has  decided  not  to  take  further
      action did not indicate that the decision of the Secretary of State is
      one which was irrational.

  17. Mr Melvin also referred to the decision in Abbasi v SSHD JR/13807/2016
      where the Tribunal held that the fact that HMRC has not yet  seen  fit
      to issue a penalty notice is neither here nor there. No doubt HMRC has
      leeway to issue a penalty notice or  institute  proceedings  and  time
      would only have started running when the declaration was made in  late
      2015. In any event,  what  the  HMRC  does  or  does  not  do  is  not
      necessarily relevant to actions by the Secretary of State in  deciding
      applications for indefinite leave to remain.

  18. He submitted that Judge  Carroll  has  accordingly  erred  in  placing
      significant weight in her reasoning on the fact that the claimant  has
      not been penalised for submitting incorrect returns. Her assessment of
      the claimant's dishonest actions in respect of her declared income  is
      flawed as a result.

  19. He also referred to the Home Office Review of Applications by  Tier  1
      (General) migrants  refused  under  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Rules,
      published on 22 November 2018.

  20. He submitted that the approach is set  out  in  the  headnote  of  the
      decision of Mr Justice Martin Spencer in  R  (on  the  application  of
      Khan) v SSHD (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph  322(5))  [2018]  UKUT
      384:

         "Where there has been a significant difference between  the  income
         claimed in a previous application  for  leave  to  remain  and  the
         income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled to draw
         an inference that the applicant has been deceitful or dishonest and
         therefore should be refused ILR  within  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
         Rules. Such an inference  could  be  expected  where  there  is  no
         plausible explanation for the discrepancy.

         Where an applicant has presented evidence to show that, despite the
         prima facie inference, he  was  not  in  fact  dishonest  but  only
         careless, then the Secretary  of  State  must  decide  whether  the
         explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her  view,  to  displace
         the prima facie influence of deceit/dishonestly.

         In approaching that fact  finding  task,  the  Secretary  of  State
         should remind herself that, although the standard of proof is  "the
         balance of probability" a finding that a person has been  deceitful
         and dishonest in relation to his tax affairs with  the  consequence
         that he is denied settlement in this  country  is  a  very  serious
         finding with serious consequences.

         For an applicant simply to blame his accountant for an  "error"  in
         relation to the historical tax return will not be the  end  of  the
         matter, given that the accountant will or  should  have  asked  the
         taxpayer to confirm that the return was accurate and to have signed
         it. Further, the applicant will have known of his earnings and will
         have expected to pay tax on them. If the applicant  does  not  take
         steps  within  a  reasonable  time  to  remedy  the  situation  the
         Secretary of State may be entitled to conclude  that  this  failure
         justifies a conclusion that there has been deceit or dishonesty.

         When considering whether or not  the  applicant  is  dishonest,  or
         merely  careless,  the  Secretary  of  State  should  consider  the
         following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to which  they
         are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

             (a) whether the explanation for the error by the accountant is
             plausible;

             (b) whether the documentation which can be  assumed  to  exist
             (for example, correspondence between  the  applicant  and  his
             accountant at the time of the tax return has been disclosed or
             there is a plausible explanation for why it  is  missing;  why
             the applicant did not realise that  an  error  had  been  made
             because of his liability to pay tax was less  than  he  should
             have expected;)

             (c) whether at any stage the  applicant  has  taken  steps  to
             remedy the situation and if so, when those  steps  were  taken
             and the explanation for any significant delay."

  21. Mr Melvin submitted  that  the  Judge  erred  in  failing  to  provide
      adequate reasons for her findings. The Secretary of State has followed
      the relevant guidance and reached a conclusion which is sustainable in
      the circumstances.

  22. On behalf of the claimant, Mr Gajjar adopted his Rule 24 response. The
      First-tier Tribunal Judge did not make any material error of law.  The
      authorities relied on, namely, Samant and Abbasi  were  both  judicial
      review cases where the rationality of the decision was raised. In such
      case there is a wide latitude afforded  to  the  Secretary  of  State.
      Neither Judge was able to conclude that the  Secretary  of  State  had
      been irrational in departing from HMRC's assessment.

  23. Further, the Secretary of State's grounds are selective when referring
      to the  decision  in  Samant.  At  [22]  Collins  J  stated  that  the
      difficulty is that there is no evidence from the Revenue as to whether
      they did consider the question of penalty or what steps, if any,  they
      decided to take and the reasons they decided as they did.

  24. In contrast to that situation, the claimant produced at p.47 a  letter
      from HMRC, dated 24 August 2017.  The claimant was informed that  they
      did not propose to take any action to recover any tax potentially lost
      for the year ended 5 April 2011, in respect of the  changes  suggested
      in her amended tax return.

  25. HMRC stated that as the claimant did not make the  amendments  to  the
      tax return within the time  frame  allowed,  they  viewed  this  as  a
      failure to take reasonable care with her tax affairs for that  period.
      Where a person fails to take reasonable care with  their  tax  affairs
      the relevant Act sets the time limit within which HMRC  can  issue  an
      assessment to collect the lost income tax. The  time  limit  to  raise
      such an assessment ran out on 5 April 2017 and that is why they  could
      take no action to collect the additional tax due as suggested  in  her
      return.

  26. Mr Gajjar submitted that this is not the  language  of  dishonesty.  A
      decision maker must distinguish between carelessness on one  hand  and
      dishonesty on the other.

  27. He referred to a report by the  TACS  Partnership.  In  the  executive
      summary, it is stated that HMRC have a duty to consider  action  where
      an inaccurate return has  been  made  by  a  taxpayer  under  relevant
      legislation. The legislation draws a distinction between  inaccuracies
      that arise because of the carelessness of the taxpayer and  those  due
      to the deliberate actions of the taxpayer.

  28. HMRC confirm that a key difference between these two categories is the
      level of knowledge of the taxpayer at the time of  the  submission  of
      the inaccurate return. To be treated as having deliberately  submitted
      an inaccurate return, the  taxpayer  has  to  be  shown  to  have  had
      knowledge that he was submitting  such  a  return.  Where  a  taxpayer
      erroneously believes he is submitting a correct return, he  cannot  be
      guilty of deliberately making an inaccurate return. This will  be  the
      case  even  though  a  prudent  taxpayer  would  have  known  of   the
      inaccuracy, or would have  taken  steps  to  seek  advice.  When  HMRC
      confirm that an inaccurate return  will  be  treated  as  due  to  the
      carelessness of the taxpayer (applying the penalty regime that applies
      to such behaviour) then they are confirming that the taxpayer did  not
      knowingly submit an incorrect return. Mr Gajjar noted  that  the  HMRC
      approach to inaccuracies in returns was not before Mr Justice Collins.



  29. He submitted that First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll had regard to  the
      bundle  of  the  Secretary  of  State  as  well  as   the   claimant's
      supplementary witness statement. She has gone through  the  chronology
      of events. She noted that no issue arose in relation  to  any  of  the
      other subsequent tax returns submitted by the claimant.

  30. Accordingly, unlike the decision in Samant, where there was an absence
      of a penalty without any indication as to why this was so, or how HMRC
      had characterised his conduct, in the claimant's case, HMRC did assess
      her conduct, finding it to have been a failure to take reasonable care
      - p. 46.

  31. He submitted that in the claimant's case, HMRC  when  advised  of  the
      discrepancy, did not propose to recover any tax that  had  potentially
      been  lost,  let  alone  to  impose  a  liability  on  her.   However,
      notwithstanding this, the claimant made the relevant payment which  is
      a strong indicator in favour of her character and conduct.

  32. He referred to the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge  Canavan,  also  a
      judicial  review,  in  the  application  of  Shaik  JR/8324/2017.  The
      applicant asserted that he only made one mistake  that  needed  to  be
      amended. Although Secretary of State failed to make findings  relating
      to the penalties imposed by HMRC, she found it is unlikely  that  this
      would have  made  any  material  difference  to  the  outcome  of  the
      application for the reasons given by Collins J in Samant.

  33. First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll stated that she was satisfied in the
      light of all the evidence that there had been no deception on the part
      of the claimant in failing to  declare  all  relevant  income  in  her
      2010/2011 tax return. Nor was she simply looking at  HMRC's  position,
      that no penalty was imposed upon her. She also referred  to  the  fact
      that the appellant had not been involved in criminality or any conduct
      of the type referred to in the respondent's policy [15].

  34. The fact that no further issues raised in respect  of  the  claimant's
      other tax returns is significant as it shows  that  there  was  not  a
      pattern of discrepancies indicative of a pattern to  save  substantial
      sums of money from HRMC by under-declaring her income [14].

  35. Mr Gajjar referred  to  the  decision  in  Khan  [2018]  UKUT  384  at
      [37(vii)]. Mr Justice Spencer stressed the fact that the Secretary  of
      State is likely to want to see evidence going beyond  mere  assertion,
      in a case such as the present,  where  the  explanation  is  that  the
      claimant was distracted by his concern for  his  son's  health.  There
      should be documentary evidence about that matter. If  there  was,  the
      Secretary of State  would  need  to  weigh  up  whether  such  concern
      genuinely excuses or explains the failure to account for  tax,  or  at
      least displaces the inference that the applicant has been deceitful or
      dishonest.

  36. Mr Gajjar submitted that there was such evidence produced before First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Carroll.

  37. Mr Melvin in reply contended that the Judge made no findings as to why
      paragraph 322(5) was not made out. When the claimant returned  to  the
      UK in 2011, she had six years to deal  with  HMRC  before  making  her
      application.

      Assessment

  38. The Secretary of State contends that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      erred in her approach as to whether the claimant has acted dishonestly
      for  the  purpose  of  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Rules,  by  placing
      significant emphasis on the fact that HMRC had not imposed  a  penalty
      or taken action against her. It is asserted that  what  HMRC  does  or
      does not do  is  not  necessarily  relevant  to  the  actions  by  the
      Secretary of State in deciding applications for  indefinite  leave  to
      remain. It is contended that her assessment relating to the claimant's
      dishonest actions was accordingly flawed.

  39. I have had regard to the judicial review decisions relied  on  by  the
      Secretary of State in this respect. In those applications,  the  court
      considered the rationality of the Secretary  of  State's  decision  in
      departing from HMRC's assessment to find that the individuals had been
      dishonest. In such cases there  is  a  wide  margin  afforded  to  the
      Secretary of State before irrationality can be  shown.  Neither  Judge
      concluded that  the  Secretary  of  State  in  those  cases  had  been
      irrational.

  40. As already noted, Judge Carroll did not simply have regard  to  HMRC's
      actions  in  not  imposing  a  penalty,   but   has   considered   the
      circumstances of the case as a whole  when  assessing  the  claimant's
      asserted innocent explanation.

  41. In the claimant's case, HMRC had in  fact  assessed  her  conduct  and
      found that she had in effect failed to take reasonable care.  That  is
      set out in the letter sent to her  at  A46.  Further,  when  HMRC  was
      advised of the discrepancy, no attempt was made to impose a  liability
      upon her. The claimant nevertheless made the relevant payment.

  42. I have had regard to the Home Office review of applications by Tier  1
      (General) migrants  refused  under  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Rules,
      published on 22 November 2018. That paragraph states that applications
      to extend individuals' stay in the UK should normally  be  refused  if
      their character and conduct means that it is undesirable for  them  to
      remain in the UK. That includes applications under the ten  year  long
      residence provisions.

  43. I have also considered HMRC's approach to inaccuracies in returns  set
      out in the executive summary:  the  legislation  draws  a  distinction
      between inaccuracies that arise because of  the  carelessness  of  the
      taxpayer and those due to the deliberate actions of the taxpayer.

  44. It is evident that First-tier Tribunal Judge  Carroll  has  considered
      the evidence as a whole and not simply  base  her  conclusion  on  the
      basis that HMRC had not imposed a penalty on the claimant. At [15] she
      stated that she has had regard to all of the  evidence  and  concluded
      that there was no deception on the part of the claimant in failing  to
      declare all relevant income in her 2010/2011 tax return.

  45. In that respect, she found that the claimant took all necessary  steps
      to remedy the situation and that HMRC has imposed no penalty. Further,
      the claimant has not been involved in criminality or  any  conduct  of
      the type referred to in the Secretary of State's policy guidance.  Nor
      had she attempted to cover up her mistake in the tax return  initially
      submitted and fully disclosed the  information  to  the  Secretary  of
      State in the questionnaire sent to her.

  46. It is also evident that she sought to provide an innocent  explanation
      in her responses to the tax questionnaire - a factor borne in mind  by
      Judge Carroll at [11-12].  She  also  concluded  that  the  claimant's
      amended 2010/2011 tax return was received by HMRC on 24 January  2017,
      p. 53, and that HMRC also apologised for taking so long to  amend  the
      self assessment tax return. It is accordingly not correct, as asserted
      by the Secretary of State, that it was only on 11 November  2017  that
      she submitted a revised self assessment return.

  47. First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll has properly taken into  account  as
      part of her assessment, the various character references and  evidence
      relating to the claimant's employment [16].  Nor was any other adverse
      factor raised against the claimant apart from the  tax  returns  [14].
      She found that there was no pattern of discrepancies  with  regard  to
      any of the other subsequent tax returns.

  48. She had regard to the claimant's circumstances set out in her detailed
      statement. She had filed the discrepant return at a time when she  had
      been absent for some time in Pakistan as her mother had been diagnosed
      with an illness and she lost her father on 13 March 2010.

  49. Her mother was diagnosed with Ascites in her liver in January 2011 and
      tuberculosis in September 2011. She visited Pakistan  between  October
      2011 and 30 December 2011. The return in question was filed in January
      2012. She had filed the return herself.

  50. She had attempted to engage an accountant to file her  return  but  he
      was unable to do so, given the short time available.

  51. She found that these factors cumulatively gave  rise  to  an  innocent
      explanation as to why she was distracted and paid  less  attention  to
      her tax returns than she might otherwise have done. Those were factors
      which were part of the assessment when considering whether or not  she
      was dishonest, or merely careless (Khan, supra, at headnote [v]).

  52. Moreover, she  had  produced  medical  evidence  including  the  death
      certificate relating to her father, as well as a hospital  letter  for
      her mother and her own medical evidence - A 93-115.

  53. She concluded in the light of all  the  evidence  that  there  was  no
      deception on the claimant's part when failing to declare all  relevant
      income in her 2010/2011 tax return.

  54. I find that First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll  has  given  sustainable
      reasons for her findings.
