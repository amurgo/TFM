In order to show only two months' worth of 'Maintenance' under  Appendix  C,
rather than being required to show nine months' worth, a student  must  have
been studying on a course within the last four months, and that course  must
itself have lasted for more than  six  months.   The  course  may  still  be
continuing, but if it came to an end within the last four  months,  and  the
student is embarking on another course (or repeating the  same  course),  it
matters not whether he was successful on the previous  course.   Appendix  C
requires the course to have  been  'completed'  no  more  than  four  months
before, but that should not be taken to mean 'successfully completed'.   The
notion of 'established presence' for Maintenance purposes requires  presence
as a student, not success as a student.



                          DETERMINATION and REASONS

1.  On 30 December 2009 the appellant applied for further  leave  to  remain
as a Tier 4 Migrant, based upon his acceptance on  a  course  commencing  at
Alpha Meridian Colleges on 1st February 2010.   His  course  fees  had  been
paid in full, but he also needed to satisfy the requirements of  Appendix  C
to the Immigration Rules for 'Maintenance'.  For this, �600  per  month  was
required, either for a two-month period or  for  a  nine-month  period.   It
would be two months if - according to paragraph 11 of Appendix C as  it  was
at that time - he was applying to  extend  leave  previously  granted  as  a
student and "the previous study  was  completed  within  the  previous  four
months."  However, if  he  was  seeking  an  extension  of  stay  "following
completion of a course of study of less than six months", he would  have  to
have available to him maintenance for nine months, i.e. �5,400.

2.  The UK Border Agency attempted to contact the appellant  at  the  e-mail
address and then at the correspondence address which he  had  given  on  his
Tier 4 (General) Application Form, but received no reply.   The  appellant's
previous education provider, Greenwich  London  College,  had  notified  the
Agency that the appellant had  not  been  attending  classes,  and  so  they
wanted evidence that he had completed his previous course.  In  the  absence
of such evidence, the Agency required the appellant to have  �5,400  in  the
bank at the time when he applied on 30th December 2009, but the  balance  in
his account on that date was only �3,231.

3.  The application was therefore refused on 'Maintenance' grounds, and  the
appellant having requested that his appeal be determined  'on  the  papers',
Immigration Judge Doran considered the matter on 23 June 2010.  He took  the
view that, having failed two of the papers set  by  the  Institute  for  the
Management of Information Systems ('IMIS'), for whose  examinations  he  was
studying at Greenwich London College, the appellant had not 'completed'  his
course there in the sense required by Appendix C.  That meant  that  he  had
to  have  available  to  him  when  he  applied  for  further  leave  enough
maintenance for nine months (�5,400) rather than two  months  (�1,200),  and
as he only had �3,231 in his Halifax account at that time,  the  appeal  was
dismissed.

4.  In his application for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  the
appellant protested that the judge had  not  taken  into  consideration  the
fact that he had provided an additional  bank  statement  dated  21st  April
2010, showing a balance of �5,890.  As explained in Pankina,  evidence  that
he had sufficient funds after he applied for further leave would  not  avail
an appellant if he did not have sufficient funds before he  applied.   This,
with respect, was overlooked by the senior  immigration  judge  who  granted
permission.   She  was  concerned  instead  with  the  fact  the  First-tier
Tribunal  had  consulted  the  Policy  Guidance  when  determining   whether
maintenance had to be available for two months or  nine  months.   But  this
was not in fact a Pankina scenario, in which the Policy Guidance was  laying
down  requirements  which  were  not  in   the   Immigration   Rules.    The
stipulations about two months and nine months were in the Rules, as well  as
in the Guidance.

5.  Further to the grant of permission, the senior  immigration  judge  gave
directions on 9th September to the effect that,  if  an  error  of  law  was
established, the Upper Tribunal would be able to re-make the decision if  it
could hear oral evidence from the appellant.   Nevertheless,  the  appellant
did not attend today's hearing.  The respondent was represented by  Mr  John
Parkinson of the Specialist Appeals Team, and he contended  before  me  that
IJ Doran had been  quite  right  to  regard  the  appellant  as  not  having
'completed' his previous course of study at Greenwich London College.

6.  I was not so sure.  The decision under appeal was made on 7 April  2010,
and it so happens that on the previous day HC 439 amended Appendix C  so  as
to introduce the notion of "an established presence studying in  the  United
Kingdom."  A student who has such a presence will need to  show  maintenance
for only two months, but without such a presence he  will  need  maintenance
for nine months.  A new paragraph 14 of Appendix C defines  'an  established
presence'.

      "14.  An applicant will have an established presence studying  in  the
      United Kingdom if the applicant has completed a  course  that  was  at
      least six months long within their last period of leave as  a  Tier  4
      migrant, a student or as a Postgraduate Doctor or  Dentist,  and  this
      course finished within the last  four  months,  or  the  applicant  is
      applying for continued study on  a  course  where  the  applicant  has
      completed at least six months of that course  and  has  been  studying
      within the last four months."

7.  It seems to me that on the  first  occurrence  of  'completed'  in  that
paragraph, it could be taken to mean successful completion, in the sense  of
having passed any requisite examinations and  having  obtained  the  desired
qualification.  On the other hand,  on  its  second  occurrence  'completed'
simply means having been on  a  course  for  the  requisite  period  of  six
months, with more of that course still to follow.  The student will  not  in
that  scenario  have  passed  all  his  exams  and  obtained   the   desired
qualification.

8.  If the course has come to an end, and the student has not  obtained  the
qualification which the course was leading towards,  he  will  be  penalized
financially, on the interpretation favoured by Mr Parkinson, if he wants  to
repeat the course, or try another course, by having  to  show  nine  months'
worth of funds.  A successful student will, on the other hand, only have  to
show two months' worth of funds if he wishes to proceed to  another  course.
But that does not seem to me to be the intention  behind  the  idea  of  'an
established presence studying in the United Kingdom'.  It is  the  studying,
rather than the success, which establishes a presence.

9.  If  that  is  the  correct  interpretation,  it  does  not  benefit  the
appellant.  The facts of his case are that his previous course of  study  at
Greenwich London College lasted for less than six months, i.e. from 1  April
to 31 August 2009, while a gap of longer than four months separated the  end
of that course  from  the  commencement  of  his  present  course  at  Alpha
Meridian Colleges on 1st February 2010.  So he needed  to  have  �5,400  for
maintenance at the time when he applied, quite apart from  the  respondent's
concerns about whether he  had  actually  been  attending  Greenwich  London
College.

10.  Immigration Judge Doran was accordingly  right  to  conclude  that  the
appellant needed �5,400, even if he was  wrong  to  think  that  'completed'
meant 'successfully completed'.  If he made an error, it  was  not  material
to the outcome.


DECISION

11. The appeal is dismissed.
