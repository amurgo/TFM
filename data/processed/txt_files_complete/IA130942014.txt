                                   Between

                             Joseph jed solomon

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to my decision dated 16 March 2015 and with the consent of the
    respondent, the appellant was granted permission to appeal the decision
    of the FTT, time having been extended.

 2. By email dated 17 March 2015 the respondent withdrew her decision dated
    26 February 2014 against which the appellant had appealed to the First-
    tier Tribunal. As a consequence  the  appellant's  application  remains
    pending before the respondent. The consent of the  Upper  Tribunal   is
    not required for such a course.

 3. There is no utility  in  these  proceedings  continuing  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  There  needs  however  to  be  a  formal  disposal  of   the
    proceedings. The respondent  has asked to  withdraw  her  case  in  the
    Upper Tribunal and leave is given for her to do so in the light of  the
    appellant's consent. The appellant's  appeal  is  therefore  unopposed.
    That appeal is allowed to the extent  the  matter  remains  before  the
    respondent for a decision on the application.

DECISION

The appeal is allowed





Signed                                  Date: 31 March 2015
