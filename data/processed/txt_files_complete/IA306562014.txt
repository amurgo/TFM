Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr H Ndubuisi, Drummond Miller Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1) This is an appeal with permission against a decision by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Knowles dismissing the appeal under the Immigration
    Rules.  The appeal was considered by Judge Knowles without a hearing.

 2) The appeal was brought against two decisions made by the respondent  on
    29 July 2014.  The first decision was to refuse the appellant leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and the second  was  to  give
    directions for his removal.

 3) The reasons for refusal were fairly narrow in compass.  As part of  his
    application, made on 8 July 2014, the appellant had to show that he had
    access to funds of not less than �200,000.   In  order  to  demonstrate
    this, the appellant produced two certificates of  deposit.   The  first
    was dated 30 June 2014 and was issued by the China Guangfa  Bank  (CGB)
    showing a balance in a deposit account of  2,030,000  Yuan.   A  letter
    from CGB confirmed that this sum was the  equivalent  of  �186,404  and
    that the sum was freely transferable to the UK.  The second certificate
    of deposit was dated 30 June 2014 and was issued by the Bank of  China.
    This showed balances in the appellant's name of �10,107.65 Sterling and
    24,173.55 in AUD.

 4) The respondent accepted that the CGB certificate  of  deposit  complied
    with the requirements of the Immigration Rules but was not so satisfied
    in respect of the certificate from the Bank of China.  According to the
    respondent, this certificate showed that the money was held only  until
    1 October 2010 and was therefore  not  available  at  present  and,  in
    addition, the certificate did not  confirm  that  the  money  could  be
    transferred to the UK.   The  respondent  therefore  decided  that  the
    requirements of paragraph 41-SD(c) of Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration
    Rules were not satisfied.

 5) The judge found that the respondent had made a mistake in stating  that
    the Bank of China certificate showed that the  sums  stated  were  held
    only to 1 October 2010.  The certificate was dated  30  June  2014  and
    appeared to be valid until 1 October 2014.  The  judge  could  find  no
    reference  in  the  Bank  of  China  certificate  to  1  October  2010.
    Accordingly this reason for refusal was not upheld by the judge.

 6) Turning to the second ground of refusal, however, the judge found there
    was nothing in the Bank of China certificate to indicate that the  sums
    stated in it were transferable to the UK.  This was  a  requirement  of
    paragraph 41-SD(c) of Appendix A.  Accordingly the judge found that the
    appellant had not proved that he had access, within the meaning of  the
    Immigration Rules, to a sum of not less than �200,000.  Accordingly the
    appellant was not entitled to 75 points for attributes under Table 4 of
    Appendix A to the Immigration Rules.

 7) The application for permission to appeal was made on  several  grounds.
    The first was that the judge decided the appeal on  26  November  2014,
    which was prior to the due date of 4 December 2014 for  the  submission
    of any further evidence or submissions.  The appellant had been sent  a
    notice by the Tribunal dated 7 October  2014  setting  the  date  of  4
    December 2014 as the date for further documents to be lodged.   It  was
    argued on behalf of the appellant that there was procedural  unfairness
    by the judge deciding the appeal prior to the final submission date.

 8) A further ground was that the judge did not consider an alleged failure
    by the respondent to consider paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules,
    which gives the respondent a discretion to request further documents in
    certain circumstances, such as where a document does  not  contain  all
    the specified information  required.   It  was  pointed  out  that  the
    certificate from CGB covered the major part of the  appellant's  funds,
    amounting to  �186,404.   The  remainder,  amounting  to  approximately
    �20,000, was held in the Bank of China but the document from  the  Bank
    of China  did  not  contain  all  the  specified  information  and  the
    respondent could have requested a further document in relation to this.



Submissions

 9) In his submission at the hearing Mr Ndubuisi relied on  both  of  these
    points.  In particular  he  relied  on  paragraph  245AA(b)(iv),  which
    applied where a specified  document  was  submitted  without  specified
    information.  The respondent did not consider this  provision  and  nor
    did the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal.  In support of  his  grounds,
    Mr Ndubuisi relied on the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Sultana
    [2014] UKUT 00540, at paragraphs 23-25.

10) For the respondent, Mr Matthews argued that even though the appeal  was
    decided  before  the  final  date  for  lodging  further  evidence   or
    submissions, this was not material.   The  appellant  was  required  to
    provide documents in the correct format with the  application  and  the
    document which was submitted with the  application  from  the  Bank  of
    China was defective.

11) As to whether the respondent could have  waived  this  requirement,  in
    accordance with Sultana, Mr Matthews pointed out that the  respondent's
    discretion was exercisable in accordance with  a  policy.   Before  the
    discretion would be exercised, the respondent must  have  a  reasonable
    belief or significant information that the evidence could be  obtained.
    How would the respondent know that the Bank of China  could  produce  a
    document to say the funds were transferable?  Mr Matthews  acknowledged
    that he had not produced the relevant policy for  the  hearing  but  he
    said he could produce it following the hearing.   Mr  Ndubuisi  had  no
    objection to this course of action.

12) Mr Matthews continued that there was nothing to suggest the  respondent
    did not consider the application in terms of  the  relevant  Rules,  as
    referred to in the decision.   There  was  no  reason  to  suppose  the
    caseworker did not consider the application under paragraph 245AA.   Mr
    Matthews referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal  in  Rodriguez
    [2014] EWCA Civ 2.  There was no basis for saying  the  defect  in  the
    document could be cured and, on the basis of the appellant's subsequent
    evidence, this understanding was correct.

13) Furthermore, paragraph 245AA had a time limit of 7 days for  compliance
    with a  request  to  supply  a  further  document.   According  to  the
    appellant the document with the required information was only  obtained
    during the appeal stage.  Even if there was unfairness by deciding  the
    appeal before the due date, this made  no  difference  because  of  the
    terms of paragraph 245AA.

14) Mr Ndubuisi responded for the appellant.  He submitted that the idea of
    flexibility was to allow information to be  requested.   There  was  no
    limit as to what the appellant was to provide to cure a defect provided
    he was given the opportunity to do  so.   Even  if  only  7  days  were
    allowed for complying with a request, no request was ever made.   There
    was no  way  of  knowing  whether  the  decision-maker  had  considered
    paragraph 245AA and whether the document would have been  available  at
    that time or not.  The CGB certificate showed a balance of �186,000 and
    the shortfall was of only �14,000.  It was possible to make an  inquiry
    when this proportion of the total amount was found to be available  and
    in these circumstances an inquiry should have been triggered.

Discussion

15) I note  that  paragraph  245AA  of  the  Immigration  Rules  is  headed
    "Documents not submitted with applications".   According  to  paragraph
    245AA, where part 6A of the Rules or any appendices referred to therein
    states that specified documents must be provided then the Secretary  of
    State will only consider documents that have been  submitted  with  the
    application and  will  only  consider  documents  submitted  after  the
    application where they are submitted in accordance  with  sub-paragraph
    (b).  The relevant part of sub-paragraph (b) in respect of this  appeal
    is (iv), which applies where a "document does not contain  all  of  the
    specified information."  In this appeal, of course, it was  found  that
    the documents  from  the  Bank  of  China  did  not  contain  specified
    information as to whether the funds held were transferable to  the  UK.
    Sub-paragraph (b) further provides that where this  provision  applies,
    the Secretary of State may contact the applicant or his  representative
    in writing and request the correct documents.  The requested  documents
    must be received at the address  specified  in  the  request  within  7
    working days of the date of the request.

16) Sub-paragraph (c) states that documents will not be requested  where  a
    specified document has not  been  submitted  (for  example  an  English
    language certificate is missing), or where the Secretary of State  does
    not anticipate that addressing the omission or error referred to in sub-
    paragraph (b) will lead to a grant  because  the  application  will  be
    refused for other reasons.   Sub-paragraph  (d)  then  allows  for  the
    missing information  to  be  verifiable  from  either  other  documents
    submitted with the application, the website of the  organisation  which
    issued the document, or the website of the appropriate regulatory body,
    provided the  Secretary  of  State  is  satisfied  that  the  specified
    documents are genuine and the applicant meets all other requirements.

17) The case  of  Sultana  concerned  an  appeal  in  which  the  specified
    documents had not  been  provided  under  Appendix  FM-SE.   There  are
    similar provisions in Appendix FM-SE to  the  provisions  in  paragraph
    245AA and it is clear from the decision that  the  relevant  principles
    will apply to paragraph 245AA in a similar way to Appendix  FM-SE.   At
    paragraph 23 of Sultana it is  pointed  out  that  the  effect  of  the
    amended version of  paragraph  245AA  is  to  create  a  discretion  or
    "flexibility" in cases where specified information though not  provided
    can be verified by other means.  Amendments  made  to  paragraph  245AA
    from 1 October 2013 were intended to provide some clarification of  the
    operation of this provision but the examples given  in  the  amendments
    were illustrative and not comprehensive.

18) For the purpose of this appeal it is the opening sentences of paragraph
    24 of Sultana which are particularly significant.  These state:

    "Whatever the decision making  context  under  the  Immigration  Rules,
    where  discretionary  powers  of  waiver  and/or  further  inquiry  are
    conferred, the possibility of a finding by a Tribunal that  a  decision
    by the primary decision maker  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law
    arises.  This would be so, for example, where it  can  be  demonstrated
    that the decision maker was not alert to the relevant  power  and  that
    such error was material."

19) It is then stated at paragraph 25:

    "Where a decision is challenged on the basis of an unlawful failure  to
    exercise a discretionary power of  further  inquiry  or  waiver  or  an
    unlawful exercise of such power, Judges will be guided  by  considering
    the purpose underlying powers of this  kind.   We  consider  that  such
    powers are to be viewed as dispensing provisions,  designed  to  ensure
    that applications suffering from minor defects or omissions  which  can
    be readily remedied or forgiven do not suffer  the  draconian  fate  of
    refusal.  In such cases, the blunt instrument  of  immediate,  outright
    and irrevocable rejection is softened to accommodate  applicants  whose
    applications suffer  from  insubstantial  imperfections  which  can  be
    easily  and  swiftly  rectified  or  excused.   Furthermore,   in   our
    estimation, discretionary powers of further enquiry and waiver  promote
    the  values  of  fairness  and  common  sense   whilst   simultaneously
    minimising  unnecessary  dominance  of  an  emphasis  on   bureaucratic
    formality.  They also fortify  the  overall  integrity  of  the  United
    Kingdom Immigration system ..."

20) In the circumstances of this appeal there is  a  strong  argument  that
    paragraph 245AA should have been invoked to remedy the omission in  the
    document provided by the appellant from  the  Bank  of  China.   As  Mr
    Ndubuisi pointed out, of the �200,000 which the appellant had  to  show
    was available to him, the respondent was satisfied with the documentary
    evidence in respect of �186,000 held in CGB.  The  balance  of  �14,000
    was vouched by the certificate from the Bank of China,  which  did  not
    contain all  of  the  specified  information.   In  the  context  of  a
    requirement to show a balance of  �200,000  in  total,  the  incomplete
    certificate in respect of �14,000 would appear to  have  suffered  from
    precisely the type of minor defect  or  omission  which  the  appellant
    should have been given an opportunity to remedy under paragraph 245AA.

21) Furthermore, as Mr Ndubuisi submitted, there was no indication that the
    decision-maker applied his or her mind to the application of  paragraph
    245AA.  Mr Matthews asked me to presume that this would have been done,
    but given the terms of the refusal decision  and  the  significance  of
    this decision for the appellant, it is difficult to make a  presumption
    to the effect that the decision-maker applied their mind  to  paragraph
    245AA.

22) I have seen the policy document submitted  by  Mr  Matthews  after  the
    hearing, to the lodging of which Mr Ndubuisi had no objection.   It  is
    headed "Points-based system - evidential flexibility" and is said to be
    valid from 12 August 2014.  It states that if there are minor errors or
    omissions on specified documents submitted with a valid application but
    there is enough evidence to show the  application  would  otherwise  be
    granted, the decision-maker may contact the migrant or  representative,
    as appropriate, for  clarification  or  to  request  missing  documents
    and/or information.  The policy guidance then addresses the effect of a
    number of changes to the relevant Rules.  These changes were  in  force
    before the making of this application for leave.  The  policy  guidance
    sets out the process for requesting additional information.   There  is
    little further in the policy guidance to indicate more  precisely  when
    discretion should be exercised.

23) In a covering  letter,  which  in  effect  amounted  to  an  additional
    submission,  Mr  Matthews  acknowledged  that  the  guidance  did   not
    expressly refer to sub-paragraph (b)(iv).  Mr Matthews  then  submitted
    that the respondent's position was that "case workers still require  to
    have reason to believe that a document could be provided which contains
    all the specified information".  Mr Matthews then  submitted  that  the
    case worker had no reason to believe that  such  a  document  could  be
    provided  and  accordingly  was  correct   not   to   request   further
    information.

24) I note that this submission has not been the subject of comment by  the
    appellant but it is in very similar terms to the submission made by  Mr
    Matthews at the  hearing.  It  seems  to  me  that  there  are  certain
    weaknesses in Mr Matthews' argument.  The first of  these  has  already
    been mentioned - there is nothing to show that the decision-maker  ever
    applied his or her mind to paragraph 245AA.  It is not known  therefore
    whether the decision-maker  concluded  that  there  was  no  reason  to
    believe that such a document could be  provided.   Furthermore,  I  was
    unable to ascertain where this test appeared in the respondent's policy
    document governing the exercise of discretion.

25) The appellant had in fact provided  a  document  with  his  application
    containing the specified information in respect  of  over  90%  of  the
    funds which the applicant had to show were  available.   The  specified
    information was only lacking in respect of the document relating to the
    remainder of the funds, which amounted to less than 10% of  the  total.
    It might have been assumed that where the applicant  had  provided  the
    specified information in respect of more than  90%  of  the  funds,  it
    would have been feasible for the applicant, were the request  made,  to
    supply the specified information in respect of  the  remaining  amount.



26) A stronger point was made by Mr  Matthews  in  his  submission  at  the
    hearing.  This was that the specified  information  required  from  the
    Bank of China was not provided at the time of the application  and  did
    not become available until  during  the  appellate  process  some  time
    later.  Mr Matthews argued that the  information  could  not  therefore
    have been provided within the 7 days  allowed  under  paragraph  245AA.
    Essentially Mr Matthews was contending that even if there was a failure
    by  the  respondent  to  exercise  discretion,  this  failure  was  not
    material.

27) It seems to be  acknowledged  in  the  application  for  permission  to
    appeal, at paragraph 17, that the Bank of China  would  not  provide  a
    letter containing the specified information at the time the application
    was  made.   It  appears  that  a  letter  containing   the   specified
    information was not provided until after the appeal was lodged  against
    the respondent's decision.  Accordingly,  it  does  seem  there  was  a
    possibility that if a  further  document  had  been  requested  by  the
    decision maker at any time before the refusal decision was made  on  29
    July 2014 the  appellant  would  not  have  been  able  to  supply  the
    specified information.  As the application of paragraph 245AA  was  not
    considered by the First-tier Tribunal, however, no finding was made  on
    this question.

28) The position is that the specified information was not requested by the
    decision-maker. It is argued that  there  is  nothing  to  suggest  the
    decision-maker ever applied his or  her  mind  to  the  application  of
    paragraph 245AA(b)(iv).  The question of whether had a further document
    containing the specified information been  requested  by  the  decision
    maker it would have been available at that time  was  not  in  practice
    resolved.

29) It is argued with considerable justification that  the  respondent  did
    not act in accordance with the law by failing to consider  whether  the
    specified information should be requested under paragraph 245AA(b)(iv).
     In these circumstances I do not consider it is for me to speculate  as
    to whether if the information had been requested  it  could  have  been
    provided.  The essential point is that there is nothing  to  show  that
    the respondent's discretion to request  further  information  was  ever
    exercised and nothing to show that the policy relating to the  exercise
    of this discretion was  followed.   To  this  extent  the  respondent's
    decision was not in accordance with the law.

30) There is the further question of whether it was unfair for the judge to
    decide the appeal before the  date  of  4  December  2014  for  lodging
    further documentary  evidence  or  submissions.   It  is  indicated  at
    paragraph 17 of the application  for  permission  to  appeal  that  the
    appellant had a letter from the Bank of China containing the  specified
    information prior to the judge's decision of 26 November 2014 but  this
    had not been lodged because the appellant  had  been  notified  by  the
    Tribunal that he had until 4 December 2014 to lodge it.  In addition it
    appears that on 29 November  2014  (not  December,  as  stated  in  the
    application for permission to appeal) the funds were  transferred  from
    the Bank of China to a bank in the UK and  the  appellant  intended  to
    produce evidence  of  this  before  the  final  submission  date  of  4
    December.

31) It should be recognised that the admissibility of documentary  evidence
    in the  appeal  was  restricted  by  s  85A(3)  of  the  2002  Act,  as
    acknowledged at paragraph 11  of  the  application  for  permission  to
    appeal.  Any letter from the Bank of China intended to supply specified
    information not before the decision-maker would appear not to fall into
    any of the provisions in s 85A(4) which allow evidence to be considered
    notwithstanding the restriction  on  admissibility.   Accordingly,  the
    judge might not have been able to allow  the  appeal  outright  on  the
    basis of a letter from the Bank of China  obtained  after  the  refusal
    decision was made.  Nevertheless it is on the face of  it  unfair  that
    the  appellant  was  denied  a  final  opportunity  to  lodge   further
    documentary evidence, which the appellant was preparing to do.

32) A further ground  raised  by  the  appellant  in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal was reliance upon Article 8, which it was said the
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal failed to consider  properly,  but  Mr
    Ndubuisi did not pursue this at the hearing.   Although  the  appellant
    has been in the UK since 2003 he has had only limited leave, first as a
    student and then as Tier 1 (Post Study Work) Migrant, and  his  private
    life would therefore carry little weight under s 117B(5)  of  the  2002
    Act.  It is difficult to envisage how any omission by the Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal in not considering Article 8 would materially  have
    affected the outcome of the appeal.

33) The position is that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law
    by (a) deciding the appeal before the final date for  further  evidence
    and submissions and (b) failing  to  consider  whether  the  respondent
    should have exercised the discretion  to  request  further  information
    under para 245AA.  By reason of these errors the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal should be set aside.  Having considered  the  application
    of paragraph 245AA to the circumstances in this appeal, I am  satisfied
    that the apparent failure by the respondent to exercise her  discretion
    under this provision in accordance with the relevant policy means  that
    the  respondent's  decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the   law.
    Accordingly the application for leave remains  outstanding  before  the
    respondent for a valid decision to  be  made  in  with  regard  to  the
    discretion contained in paragraph 245AA and the appeal is  remitted  to
    the Secretary of State for this purpose.

Conclusions

34) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

35) I set aside the decision.

36) I re-make the decision in the appeal by finding that  the  decision  of
    the respondent of 29 July 2014 is not in accordance with the law.   The
    application remains before the Secretary of State for a valid  decision
    to be made.

Anonymity

37) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order.   I  have  not
    been asked to make such an order  and  in  the  circumstances  of  this
    appeal I see no reason of substance for doing so.

Fee Award   Note: This is not part of the determination

In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  I  have
considered whether to make a fee  award.   Although  the  decision  appealed
against was not in accordance with the law, the evidence and submissions  on
which the appellant relied to challenge the decision  were  brought  forward
as part of the appeal and not  as  part  of  the  original  application.   I
therefore make no fee award
