                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator  (Mr  PW  Cruthers),
   sitting at Manchester on 12 January 2004, allowing an appeal by a Hazara
   citizen of Afghanistan, on asylum and human rights  grounds.  Permission
   to appeal was given on the basis that the  adjudicator  might  not  have
   been entitled to find that one Commander Qazavi (whom  he  accepted  the
   claimant genuinely feared) actually occupied "... a position of power in
   the current administration" without any background evidence  to  support
   that finding.

2. We bear in mind CA [2004] EWCA 1165, which makes it clear that, contrary
   to what some people had thought, the requirement in the  present  (2002)
   Act for there to be a point of law involved for an appeal to be  allowed
   is not merely a threshhold requirement at the permission  stage,  but  a
   substantive one, relating to the decision at hearing. The definition  of
   such a point has recently been somewhat extended in E &  R  [2003]  EWCA
   Civ 49. However most lawyers  are  familiar  with  the  long-established
   general rule that deciding an issue on insufficient  evidence  does  not
   raise a point of law; but deciding it on no  relevant  evidence  at  all
   does.


3. Those involved in this field will also be  familiar  with  the  approval
   given in S [2002] EWCA 539 to what Laws LJ described in these terms at �
   27:

      While in our general  law  this  notion  of  a  factual  precedent  is
   exotic, in the context of the IAT's responsibilities it seems to us,  in
   principle, to be benign and practical.

      At that time of course, the Tribunal  had  jurisdiction  to  entertain
   appeals on points of fact as well as  law;  but  it  is  interesting  to
   compare the Court of  Appeal's  assessment  of  their  own  position  in
   Shirazi [2003] EWCA Civ 1562. The Court of Appeal of course required  an
   error of law to entertain an appeal;  but they were able to find one  in
   there being Tribunal decisions on the general factual point in  question
   which were inconsistent with each other..

4. If that situation involves an error of law by those responsible, then it
   must equally be the responsibility of the Tribunal to do what we can  to
   prevent its arising in the first place, and  in  particular  to  provide
   adjudicators with  suitable  general  guidance.  A  system  of  "country
   guidance" cases has been developed since the decision  in  Shirazi  with
   that object in mind, and this will be one of them. So far as  it  is  of
   general application (which will be made  clear),  adjudicators  will  be
   expected to follow it, and it is  anticipated  that  the  Tribunal  will
   regard any failure to do so as raising a point of law.

5. The passage on which the point turns in this case is at � 59,  referring
   to the claimant's belief that Qazavi would be able to wreak vengeance on
   him on return to Kabul:

      The exact basis of the appellant's belief has not been spelt  out  but
   given the way that commanders  have  come  and  gone  from  power  under
   various governments in Afghanistan in recent years, it seems to me  that
   there is a real possibility that Commander Qazavi does hold  a  position
   of power in the current administration.

      Put like that, the basis for the adjudicator's decision on this  point
   seems to involve a complete failure to inquire what evidence might  have
   been expected to confirm such a  contention.  Adjudicators,  like  other
   fact-finders in the asylum system, are subject to the double  obligation
   expressed in �� 203-4 of the UNHCR handbook: by  �  203,  they  must  be
   prepared to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt (and particularly
   on his individual history)  where  no  evidence  is  available  after  a
   genuine effort to obtain it; but by � 204, they should only do  so,  not
   only when satisfied of his general credibility, but after obtaining  and
   checking all available evidence.

6. The responsibility for obtaining evidence under our  adversarial  system
   is of course that of the parties; but that in our view does not  absolve
   the adjudicator from  considering  what  evidence  might  reasonably  be
   required in a given set of circumstances to  confirm  a  given  fact  or
   situation; nor did Mr Bild seek to argue otherwise. It is one  thing  to
   accept a claimant's personal ("subjective") history, where by the nature
   of things (see UNHCR handbook  �  197)  there  may  be  little  evidence
   available to confirm it); but quite another to  accept  his  account  as
   evidence of a  general  situation,  not  supported  by  such  background
   ("objective") evidence as might reasonably be expected.


7. The passage we have set out from the adjudicator's  �  59  in  our  view
   falls into this category. The adjudicator was well entitled to find that
   the claimant had, on his own account, a "subjective" fear of Qazavi; but
   to find on an "objective" basis, that Qazavi held a "position of  power"
   in the current administration, without any attempt to inquire  how  that
   might  reasonably  have  been  confirmed  (beyond   the   rather   vague
   observation about commanders coming  and  going),  was  in  our  view  a
   mistake, and, for the reasons we have given,  one  of  law  which  would
   require us to intervene. That means the Home Office appeal would have to
   be allowed, unless Mr  Bild  were  able  to  support  the  adjudicator's
   decision on some other evidence, or some other basis.

8. As it happens, Mr Bild put the claimant's case  before  us  in  quite  a
   different way. Qazavi was no  longer  presented  as  someone  holding  a
   "position of power in the current administration": if that had been  the
   case, so far as Kabul was concerned, we do not doubt that due  diligence
   by the claimant's advisers would have produced at least  some  reference
   to him in the background evidence. However Mr Bild now presented him  as
   probably only a commander of some 40 or 50 men: a neighbourhood,  rather
   than a national figure. This of course would beg the question as to  how
   he was to harm the claimant on return.

9. That is answered by Mr Bild  in  this  way:  Qazavi's  Harakat  e-Islami
   ['Islamic Movement'] is allied (see CIPU  April  2004,  p  124)  to  the
   Jamiat e-Islami ['Islamic Society'], which it was  accepted  in  No.  32
   [2002] UKIAT 0008360 policed Kabul with their militia. ISAF had  (as  is
   generally accepted) no neighbourhood policing function; and it followed,
   he said, that whatever plans of vengeance Qazavi might have against  the
   claimant would meet no opposition from any law enforcement forces.

10. As a Hazara, the claimant would have no alternative  to  living  in  the
   Hazara quarter of the capital: see the report by Dr SA  Moussavi  of  St
   Anthony's College, Oxford, who goes on to mention the lack of protection
   there for them. Although the claimant's wife and daughter  stayed  there
   when he left, apparently running the family shop, a recent  letter  from
   the wife has been produced, showing the difficulties she  says  she  has
   had.

11. Miss Brown was more  concerned  to  note  the  adjudicator's  errors  in
   approach, with which we have already dealt, than to challenge the result
   on the individual case. We think on its very particular  facts,  as  put
   before us by Mr Bild, that result may be  justified  by  the  claimant's
   individual position putting him  at  risk  of  identification  and  ill-
   treatment by a minor figure who might have wider support; but we  should
   emphasize that this decision is not  to  be  regarded  as  any  kind  of
   paradigm for future ones in favour of persons  claiming  to  fear  minor
   Kabul "warlords".

12. So far as the "country guidance" point is concerned, it relates  to  the
   approach adjudicators should take to claims of fear  of  "warlords".  In
   our view they  need  in  each  case  to  ask  themselves  the  following
   questions:

    a) What is the exact position  of  the  "warlord"  (so  far  as  it  can
       reasonably be obtained)?
    b) What are the geographical limits of his power? and




   In the light of a) and b):


    c)  What  background  evidence  of  his  existence  and  position  might
       reasonably be expected? and in the light of that:
    d) How far does whatever the adjudicator accepts about him lead  to  any
       real risk for the claimant at the point of return (or  elsewhere,  so
       far as relevant)?


13. There is of course an exercize of judgement called for  as  to  how  far
   any individual "warlord" who (in Mr Bild's apt phrase) came  "below  the
   radar" of the background evidence would be in a position to present  any
   real risk on return; but that is for individual adjudicators to make  on
   the facts before them. No doubt they will bear in mind that there  is  a
   great deal more information in the public domain about Kabul,  which  is
   also the point of return, than about areas outside the capital.
