Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Jaisri instructed by Sam Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal who was born on 27  February  1980.
    His father, Mim Bahadur Gurung is a former Ghurkha soldier who  settled
    in the UK on 6 October  2005  along  with  his  wife,  the  appellant's
    mother.

 2. The appellant's father enlisted  in  the  Brigade  of  Ghurkhas  on  27
    October 1956 and served in the army for over fourteen  years.   He  was
    discharged on 10  December  1970  when  he  was  made  redundant.   The
    appellant's mother and father came to the UK to settle in October 2005.
     It is not contentious that that  was  the  earliest  time,  given  the
    immigration "historic injustice"  perpetrated  against  former  Ghurkha
    soldiers and their families, when the  appellant's  mother  and  father
    could come to the UK to settle.  By that time, however,  the  appellant
    was too old to qualify under the Rules or policy to travel  with  them.
    In 2015, the position for family members changed but the appellant  was
    still too old  to  come  to  the  UK  under  those  provisions.   As  a
    consequence, the appellant continued to live  in  the  family  home  in
    Nepal.

 3. On 30 April 2019, the appellant applied for entry clearance  to  settle
    in the UK as the dependent  son  of  his  father,  the  sponsor.   That
    application was refused by the  ECO  on  23  July  2019.   It  was  not
    accepted, for the purposes of Art 8, that  the  appellant  and  sponsor
    (including his mother) had established 'family life' for  the  purposes
    of Article 8.1.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a decision  sent
    on 16 December 2020, Judge  Mailer  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal
    under Art 8.  He was not satisfied that the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and his parents was such as to give rise to 'family life'  so
    that Art 8.1 was engaged.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 5. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on four
    grounds.  Each ground challenged the judge's finding that Art  8.1  was
    not engaged.

 6. On 25 January 2021, the First-tier Tribunal  (RJ  Zucker)  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal.

 7. The appeal was listed at the Cardiff Civil Justice Centre on  29  April
    2021 working remotely.  The appellant was represented by Mr Jaisri  and
    the respondent by Mr Kotas both of whom joined the hearing by Skype.

The Judge's Decision

 8. The judge had a bundle of documents filed on behalf of the appellant as
    well as the respondent's bundle.  In addition, the  appellant's  father
    (the sponsor) gave oral evidence before the judge.  The judge noted (at
    para 82) that  there  was  no  witness  statement  from  the  appellant
    although there was a typed letter dated 14 May 2019.

 9. The judge made a number of uncontentious findings at paras  83-88.   He
    accepted that the appellant was the son of a former Ghurkha soldier and
    that his parents had been granted settlement on 6  October  2005.   The
    appellant was now 39 years of age and he had been  separated  from  his
    parents for about fourteen years prior to the application.  He was  one
    of six children.  Two of his siblings lived in different areas in Nepal
    and he had two married sisters currently settled in the UK  and  living
    independently.  The judge accepted that the appellant  lived  with  his
    parents in their family home prior to them moving to the  UK  in  2005.
    He also accepted that the appellant continued to live in  his  family's
    home after his parents came to the UK in 2005.  There was evidence that
    the appellant had been issued with two passports, one in December  2006
    and another in March 2016.   However, the judge declined  to  speculate
    about why the appellant possessed these passports.

10. At paras 89-92, the judge dealt with the issue of whether the appellant
    was unemployed in Nepal.  He said this:

         "89. The appellant, as well as his parents, have contended that  he
             cannot find a job as there are limited  job  opportunities  in
             Nepal.  It is also asserted that  having  regard  to  his  low
             academic qualifications, the appellant remains unemployed.


         90.  There is no evidence produced  that  since  his  parents  left
             Nepal, the appellant has looked for jobs,  including  the  odd
             labouring job.  Indeed, the appellant did not  even  claim  in
             his letter dated 14 May 2019 that  he  has  looked  for  jobs,
             albeit unsuccessfully.  He has simply asserted that his  lower
             educational qualification has been an obstacle to his  ability
             to support himself.


         91.  Nor has any satisfactory explanation been given as to why such
             evidence could not have been  produced.   In  the  event,  the
             assertions regarding the limited  availability  of  employment
             for a person in the position of the appellant in Nepal  remain
             unsubstantiated.


         92.  In the absence of credible evidence regarding  the  employment
             situation in Nepal, I do not  accept  that  the  appellant  is
             unable to obtain employment in Nepal."


11. I interpolate here that none of that reasoning  is  challenged  in  the
    grounds.

12. Then at paras 93-100 the judge dealt with the evidence, relevant  to  a
    claim that the appellant was  dependent  upon  his  father,  concerning
    money transfers to him:

         "93. I have had regard to the evidence of money transfers  set  out
             at paragraph 31 of Mr Gurung's statement - A9-A10.   According
             to the schedule, such transfers commenced in August 2015  with
             the last  transfer  being  on  12  January  2020.   There  are
             substantial gaps in that period, sometimes in excess of  three
             months between one transfer and another.  The amount  of  �128
             was sent on 31 August 2019.  It  was  only  some  four  months
             later that the further �200 was sent.


         94.  Furthermore, although Mr Gurung stated  that  they  have  been
             supporting  the   appellant   financially   since   2005,   no
             substantiating evidence has been produced for the period  2005
             until 2015.  There is merely an assertion that they have  been
             sending money to him for his upkeep.  No explanation has  been
             given as to  why  satisfactory  evidence  substantiating  that
             claim could not have been produced.


         95.  I have had regard to a statement of account in  the  sponsor's
             name at Pokhara Finance Ltd for the period 22  September  2019
             up to 29 January 2020, reflecting  various  credits  for  each
             month.  These are apparently pension  payments  to  which  the
             sponsor is  entitled.   There  are  also  apparently  interest
             payments although it is difficult to read A92 as it is a  very
             indistinct copy.  It is stated in the account at A91 that  the
             previous  balance  on  25  September  2019  was  '0.00'.    No
             explanation has been given for this.   Nor  have  any  further
             bank  statements  been  produced  for  the  period  prior   to
             September 2019.


         96.  There is accordingly no explanation from the appellant or  his
             sponsors as to how he has been able to  maintain  and  support
             himself over the years, which includes  the  paying  of  bills
             with money and other occurring expenses.  There is no evidence
             of any receipt of funds from any other family members,  friend
             or any other source in  Nepal,  or  elsewhere.   Nor  has  the
             appellant himself asserted in his letter that any person  from
             the UK has ever visited him in Nepal and handed  over  to  him
             money given to them by his sponsors in the UK.


         97.  The appellant's sponsor acknowledged  under  cross-examination
             that the appellant is not dependent on him, but they send  him
             monies.  He stated that they need his help instead as they are
             growing old.


         98.  As part of the evidence as a whole, I have had regard  to  the
             evidence produced of communications between the appellant  and
             his parents in the Viber screenshots at A6-A7.   These  relate
             to the period from the middle of 2019 until 2  February  2020.
             I have also considered the evidence of  the  visits  that  his
             parents have made to Nepal from  January  2006  until  October
             2019.


         99.  There  is  very  little  by  way  of  evidence  regarding  the
             appellant's living arrangements and  his  day-to-day  life  in
             Nepal.  As already noted, he has been afforded an  opportunity
             to provide a full, clear and detailed history  of  his  living
             arrangements and his  day-to-day  life  in  Nepal.   This  was
             pointed out by the Entry Clearance Manager on 15 January 2020.




         100. There is accordingly a paucity of evidence  presented  by  the
             appellant and his sponsors regarding his  asserted  dependency
             on them.  There has thus been a failure  to  provide  all  the
             information necessary to enable a full assessment to  be  made
             of his actual situation."


13.  Then  at  paras  101-102,  the  judge  dealt  with   the   appellant's
    circumstances in Nepal as follows:

         "101.    As at the date of the hearing, the appellant was 40  years
             old.  He has been living away from his parents since 6 October
             2015 some fifteen years to date.


         102. There is no evidence  concerning  his  relationship  with  his
             brothers, both of whom live in Nepal.  There is no evidence of
             any remaining extended family in Nepal,  no  evidence  of  the
             appellant's own  friends  and  relationships  which  may  have
             developed over the years.  There is no evidence that a network
             of contacts, friends and support systems are not in  place  in
             Nepal.  Nor is it unusual that persons in the position of  his
             sponsor send money to Nepal."


14. Then at paras 103-107, the judge  made  his  findings  in  relation  to
    whether the appellant had established family life under Art 8.1:

         "103.     I  find  that  the  evidence  of  visits  and   financial
             remittances do not in this case establish the necessary  real,
             committed or effective support to establish an  extant  family
             life.  I find that  money  transfers  and  visits  relied  on,
             amounting to circumstances is nothing more than the usual love
             and affection between an adult and his parents.


         104. I accordingly find that the appellant is a fully mature  adult
             living his own life in Nepal.  Very little evidence  has  been
             presented as to what he has done during the past fifteen years
             since he became  separated  from  his  parents.   Despite  the
             financial remittances he has received from his parents,  their
             visits to Nepal and their communication  via  video  chat  and
             telephone calls with him, he has continued  to  live  his  own
             life.  I accordingly find that Article 8 of the  Human  Rights
             Convention is not engaged.


         105. The love and commitment of his parents to him is not  doubted.
             They have also shown persistence  in  seeking  to  secure  his
             settlement in the UK.


         106. In Patel, Modha and Odedara v ECO [2010] EWCA Civ 17 at  [14],
             Lord Justice Sedley stated that you can set out to  compensate
             for an historic wrong but you cannot reverse  the  passage  of
             time.  Many of these children are now grown up and embarked on
             lives of their own.  Where this has happened, the bonds  which
             constitute family life will no longer be there and  Article  8
             will have no purchase.  In disposing of the case of Odedara he
             upheld as legitimate a  factual  finding  that  there  was  no
             family life which engaged Article 8 where  there  was  only  a
             bear  financial  dependency  upon  the  appellants  and  their
             parents.


         107. For the foregoing, I conclude that there  is  no  family  life
             between the appellant and his parents so as to engage  Article
             8 of the Human Rights Convention."


15. As a consequence, the judge dismissed the appeal under Art 8.

The Submissions

16. Drawing on the four grounds of appeal, Mr  Jaisri  submitted  that  the
    judge had erred in law in a number of respects.

17. Ground 1: Mr Jaisri submitted that the judge had failed  to  apply  the
    approach set out in Rai v Entry Clearance  Officer,  New  Delhi  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 320 at [42].  When  determining  whether  there  was  real  or
    committed or effective support. the judge failed  to  consider  whether
    there was family life at the time the appellant's parents left Nepal to
    settle in the UK and whether that subsisted and was still subsisting at
    the date of the hearing.

18. Additionally, Mr Jaisri submitted that the judge  had  failed  to  take
    into account as an aspect of financial dependency  that  the  appellant
    was residing in the family home.

19. Ground 2: Mr Jaisri submitted that the judge  had  failed  properly  to
    take into account the extent and length of visits by the sponsor, which
    were unchallenged by the respondent, to Nepal between January 2006  and
    October 2019.

20. Ground 3: Mr Jaisri submitted that the judge had taken into account  an
    irrelevant  consideration  in  para  102  of   his   determination   by
    considering the relationships between the appellant  and  his  siblings
    and family in Nepal.  The focus should have been exclusively  upon  the
    relationship between the appellant and the sponsor in the UK.

21. Ground 4: Mr Jaisri submitted that the judge had failed  to  take  into
    account, as an aspect of dependency, namely the emotional dependency of
    the sponsor, as set out in his evidence, upon the appellant.

22. Mr Kotas submitted that the judge had correctly directed himself on the
    requirements to establish "family life" citing the case of  Kugathas  v
    SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31 at paras 71-73 of  his  determination  and  the
    decision of Rai at para 74 of his determination.

23. Further, as regards the appellant  being  accommodated  in  the  family
    home, Mr Kotas submitted that was self-evident and the judge  was  well
    aware that that was the case and it could not be said he did  not  have
    regard to it.

24. Secondly, as regards the visits by  the  sponsor  to  Nepal,  Mr  Kotas
    submitted that the judge clearly made reference to  these  visits.   He
    set out the evidence at paras 35-36 and  49.   The  judge  specifically
    stated that he took those visits into account in reaching his  findings
    at paras 98 and 103.  It could not be  said,  therefore,  that  he  had
    failed to take those into account and the ground was  no  more  than  a
    disagreement with the weight that the judge gave that evidence.

25. Thirdly, the judge was entitled to take into account relationships with
    siblings and family members in Nepal at para 102.

26. Fourthly, Mr Kotas submitted that the judge, having correctly  directed
    himself on the nature of "family life", fully took into account all the
    evidence including that he claimed not to have worked  in  Nepal,  that
    the sponsor said  in  cross-examination  that  the  appellant  was  not
    dependent upon him and that there was gaps in the  supporting  evidence
    of financial dependency together with the fact that the  appellant  had
    spent a considerable time on his own in Nepal.  Mr Kotas submitted that
    the judge had properly taken into account emotional dependency  between
    the appellant and sponsor.

27. In reply, Mr Jaisri reiterated under ground 1 that the  judge  had  not
    adopted the approach set out  in  Rai  at  [42]  by  considering  first
    whether family life existed at the time his parents came to the  UK  in
    2005 and whether it had continued to subsist up to the date of hearing.



28. In relation to ground 3, Mr Jaisri accepted, in  response  to  a  point
    raised by me during his reply, that the  judge  in  para  102  had  not
    counted against the appellant that  he  had  established  relationships
    with his siblings and extended family in Nepal when finding that he had
    not established family life with the sponsor  in  the  UK  because,  in
    fact, the judge had found that  there  was  no  evidence  of  any  such
    relationships in Nepal.

Discussion

29. The relevant law in respect  of  establishing  "family  life"  for  the
    purposes of Art 8 was helpfully summarised in  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    decision in Rai.  As in the present appeal, Rai involved a claim by  an
    adult child of a former Ghurkha soldier who sought to join  his  family
    in the UK relying on Art 8.  In that case, drawing on the earlier  case
    law of the  Court  of  Appeal,  Lindblom  LJ  (with  whom  Beatson  and
    Henderson LJJ agreed), said this at [16]-[20]:

         "16.  The  legal  principles  relevant  to  this  issue   are   not
             controversial.


          1. In Kugathas v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
             [2003] EWCA Civ 31, Sedley L.J. said (in paragraph 17  of  his
             judgment)  that  "if  dependency  is  read  down  as   meaning
             "support", in the personal sense, and if one adds, echoing the
             Strasbourg jurisprudence, "real" or "committed" or "effective"
             to the word "support", then it represents ... the  irreducible
             minimum of what family life  implies".  Arden  L.J.  said  (in
             paragraph 24 of her judgment) that the "relevant  factors  ...
             include  identifying  who  are  the  near  relatives  of   the
             appellant, the nature  of  the  links  between  them  and  the
             appellant, the age of the appellant, where and  with  whom  he
             has resided in the past, and  the  forms  of  contact  he  has
             maintained with the other members of the family with  whom  he
             claims to have a family life". She acknowledged (at  paragraph
             25) that "there is no presumption of  family  life".  Thus  "a
             family life is not established between an adult child and  his
             surviving parent  or  other  siblings  unless  something  more
             exists than normal emotional ties".  She  added  that  "[such]
             ties might exist if the appellant were dependent on his family
             or vice versa", but it was "not ... essential that the members
             of the family should be in the same  country".  In  Patel  and
             others v Entry Clearance Officer, Mumbai [2010] EWCA  Civ  17,
             Sedley L.J. said (in paragraph 14 of his judgment, with  which
             Longmore and Aikens L.JJ. agreed) that "what may constitute an
             extant family  life  falls  well  short  of  what  constitutes
             dependency, and a good many adult children ... may still  have
             a family life with parents who are now  settled  here  not  by
             leave or by force of circumstance but by long-delayed right".


          1. In Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha  policy)  the  Upper
             Tribunal accepted (in paragraph 56 of its determination)  that
             the  judgments  in  Kugathas   had   been   "interpreted   too
             restrictively in the past and ought to be read in the light of
             subsequent decisions of the domestic and  Strasbourg  courts",
             and (in paragraph 60) that "some of the  [Strasbourg]  Court's
             decisions indicate that family life between adult children and
             parents will readily be found, without evidence of exceptional
             dependence". It went on to say (in paragraph 61):


                  "61. Recently, the [European Court of  Human  Rights]  has
                  reviewed the case law, in [AA v United Kingdom [2012] Imm.
                  A.R.1], finding that a significant factor will be  whether
                  or not the adult child has founded a family of his own. If
                  he is still single and living  with  his  parents,  he  is
                  likely to enjoy family life with them. ...".


             The Upper Tribunal set out the relevant passage in the court's
             judgment in AA v United Kingdom  (in  paragraphs  46  to  49),
             which ended with this (in paragraph 49):


                  "49. An examination of the Court's case-law would tend  to
                  suggest that the applicant, a young adult of 24 years old,
                  who resides with his mother and  has  not  yet  founded  a
                  family of his own,  can  be  regarded  as  having  "family
                  life"."


          1. Ultimately, as Lord Dyson  M.R.  emphasized  when  giving  the
             judgment of the  court  in  Gurung  (at  paragraph  45),  "the
             question whether an individual enjoys family life  is  one  of
             fact and  depends  on  a  careful  consideration  of  all  the
             relevant facts of the particular case". In some instances  "an
             adult child (particularly if he does not  have  a  partner  or
             children of his own) may establish that he has a  family  life
             with his parents". As Lord Dyson M.R. said, "[it] all  depends
             on the facts". The court expressly endorsed (at paragraph 46),
             as "useful" and as indicating  "the  correct  approach  to  be
             adopted",  the  Upper  Tribunal's  review  of   the   relevant
             jurisprudence in paragraphs 50 to 62 of its  determination  in
             Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy), including  its
             observation (at paragraph 62) that "[the]  different  outcomes
             in cases with superficially similar features emphasises to  us
             that the issue under Article 8(1) is highly fact-sensitive".


          1. To similar effect  were  these  observations  of  Sir  Stanley
             Burnton in Singh v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
             [2015] EWCA Civ 630 (in paragraph 24 of his judgment):


                  "24. I do not think that the judgments  to  which  I  have
                  referred lead to any difficulty in determining the correct
                  approach to Article 8 in cases involving  adult  children.
                  In the case of  adults,  in  the  context  of  immigration
                  control, there is no legal or factual  presumption  as  to
                  the existence or absence of family life for  the  purposes
                  of Article 8.  I  point  out  that  the  approach  of  the
                  European Commission for Human Rights cited approvingly  in
                  Kugathas   did   not   include    any    requirement    of
                  exceptionality. It all depends on the facts. The love  and
                  affection between an adult and  his  parents  or  siblings
                  will not of itself justify a finding  of  a  family  life.
                  There has to be something more. A young adult living  with
                  his parents or siblings will normally have a  family  life
                  to be respected under Article 8. A child enjoying a family
                  life with his parents does not suddenly cease  to  have  a
                  family life at midnight as he turns 18 years  of  age.  On
                  the other hand, a young adult living independently of  his
                  parents may well not have a family life for  the  purposes
                  of Article 8."


30. As will be clear, the need  to  establish  "family  life"  is  a  fact-
    sensitive issue.  It will  not  be  presumed  to  exist  between  adult
    siblings  or  between  an  adult  child  and  parent.   What  must   be
    established is "more  than  normal  emotional  ties".   There  must  be
    "support" which is "real" or "committed" or "effective".

31. In Uddin v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 332, the Senior President of  Tribunals
    (Sir Ernest Ryder, with whom Bean and King LJJ agreed), having set  out
    extracts from the decision in Kugathas, said this at [31]:

         "Dependency, in the Kugathas sense, is accordingly not  a  term  of
         art.  It is a question of fact, a matter  of  substance  not  form.
         The irreducible minimum of what family life  implies  remains  that
         which Sedley LJ described as  being  whether  support  is  real  or
         effective or committed".


         (See also [40(i)].)

32. Again, as in Rai, the test of "support" is expressed  disjunctively  as
    having to be "real" or "effective" or "committed".

33. In this appeal, there is no doubt, as  Mr  Kotas  submitted,  that  the
    judge correctly directed himself in respect of this approach  referring
    to, and citing from, Kugathas at  paras  71-73  of  his  determination.
    Although, at times, the submissions made to the judge,  and  indeed  in
    the grounds of appeal,  refer  to  the  test  of  real,  committed  and
    effective support, the judge correctly set out the disjunctive test  at
    para 103 which I set out earlier.

34. Mr Jaisri made two points under ground 1.

35. First, he relied upon [42] of Lindblom LJ's judgment in  Rai  where  he
    said this:

         "Those circumstances of the appellant and his family, all  of  them
         uncontentious, and including - perhaps crucially - the fact that he
         and his parents would have applied at the same time  for  leave  to
         enter the United Kingdom and would have come to the United  Kingdom
         together as a family unit had they been able to afford to do so, do
         not appear to have been grappled with by the Upper  Tribunal  judge
         under article 8(1). In my view they should have been. They went  to
         the heart of the matter: the question of whether, even  though  the
         appellant's parents had chosen to leave  Nepal  to  settle  in  the
         United Kingdom when they did, his family life with  them  subsisted
         then, and was still subsisting at the time of the Upper  Tribunal's
         decision. This was the critical question under article  8(1).  Even
         on the most benevolent reading of his determination, I do not think
         one can say that the Upper Tribunal judge properly  addressed  it."
         (my emphasis)


36. What Lindblom LJ was saying in [42] was that, in order to  succeed,  an
    individual must show a continuum of "family life"  beginning  with  the
    point in time when their parents came to the UK to  settle  and  ending
    with the hearing before the relevant Tribunal.   I  do  not  understand
    Lindblom LJ to be setting out a straight jacket approach that  requires
    a  judge  to  consider,  in  a  particular  order,  the  existence  and
    establishment of family life over the relevant time period.

37. In this appeal, unless otherwise unsustainable, the  judge  found  that
    there was "a paucity of evidence" concerning the issue  of  dependency,
    relied upon by the appellant, prior to 2015 - in other words,  for  the
    period 2005 until 2015.  Read as a whole, that led the  judge  to  find
    that family life had not been established throughout the relevant,  and
    required period, between 2005 (when the appellant's parents came to the
    UK to settle) and 2020 (when the judge was hearing the  appeal).   That
    was, in my judgment, not a finding which was  reached  by  an  improper
    process of reasoning as proposed by Mr Jaisri relying upon the words of
    Lindblom LJ in Rai at [42].

38. The second point made by Mr Jaisri under ground 1 was  that  the  judge
    failed to take into account, as an aspect of financial dependency, that
    the appellant was living in the family  home.   Of  course,  the  judge
    accepted that the appellant had lived in the family home prior  to  his
    parents leaving in 2005 and subsequently had remained there after  they
    left.  The judge made that finding at para 85 of his determination.  It
    cannot fairly be said, in my judgment, that the judge  failed  to  take
    this  into  account  in  reaching  his  findings.   It  was   a   point
    specifically made by Mr Jaisri in para 10 of his skeleton argument.  Of
    course, the weight of the argument made  on  behalf  of  the  appellant
    concerned direct financial support - through monies paid by the sponsor
    - and also emotional dependency.

39. For these reasons, I reject ground 1.

40. As regards ground 2, I accept  Mr  Kotas'  submission  that  the  judge
    plainly took into account the visits made by the sponsor to Nepal.  The
    judge made reference, as I have already pointed out, to the evidence in
    relation to those visits at paras 35-36 and 49.  He referred at para 63
    to Mr Jaisri's submission,  relying  on  those  visits,  to  support  a
    finding that family life existed.  In reaching his findings, the  judge
    specifically stated at para 78 and again at para 103 that he  took  the
    visits into account.  It is simply not arguable that he failed to  have
    regard to this evidence.  Taken as a whole, the only basis  upon  which
    an error of law could  be  established  would  be  if  the  judge  gave
    unreasonable or irrational weight to those visits, i.e. gave them  such
    weight that no reasonable judge could do.   I  did  not  understand  Mr
    Jaisri's submissions to place this ground firmly in that territory.  In
    any event, I see no basis upon which, having regard to the whole of the
    evidence including that the sponsor has  a  number  of  other  children
    living in  Nepal,  that  the  judge  gave  Wednesbury  unreasonable  or
    irrational weight to this evidence.

41. For these reasons, I reject ground 2.

42. As regards ground 3, I do  not  accept  Mr  Jaisri's  premise  that  in
    assessing whether an individual  has  established  "family  life"  with
    particular family members in the UK, it  is  irrelevant  to  take  into
    account his links with any family members in his or  her  own  country.
    Clearly, the issue is whether the family life with the  family  members
    in the UK is established but close links with family members  in  their
    own country may impact upon that assessment and, of course, the absence
    of any close ties with family in their own country may support a  claim
    of close ties with family in the UK.  Although it is not crystal clear,
    that broad assessment is contemplated by Arden LJ (as she then was)  in
    Kugathas at [24] where she said this:

         "The court has to scrutinise the relevant  factors.   Such  factors
         include identifying who are the near relatives  of  the  appellant,
         the nature of the links between them and the appellant, the age  of
         the appellant, where and with whom he has resided in the past,  and
         the forms of contact he has maintained with the  other  members  of
         the family with whom he claims to have a family life."


43. In any event, as I pointed out to Mr Jaisri during his reply,  at  para
    102 the judge found that there was no evidence of close ties  with  his
    family in Nepal  and,  therefore,  even  if  Mr  Jaisri's  premise  was
    correct, the judge did not count against the appellant, in  determining
    whether he had established family life with the sponsor,  that  he  had
    close ties with relatives in Nepal.  Ground 3 is, therefore, rejected.

44. As regards ground 4, the discrete point made by Mr Jaisri is  that  the
    judge failed to take into account not the dependency of  the  appellant
    upon the sponsor but rather the dependency of the sponsor  (and  indeed
    the appellant's mother) upon the appellant.

45. That rests upon the evidence sent out at para 43 of  the  determination
    where the sponsor said that the appellant was not  dependent  upon  him
    but that he and his wife needed the appellant's help  instead  as  they
    were getting old, they could not do a lot of things for their  own  and
    his wife's health was poorly.  This  issue  does  not  appear  to  have
    featured in Mr  Jaisri's  skeleton  argument  or  indeed  in  his  oral
    submissions following the sponsor's evidence.  The focus  of  the  case
    was upon a claim that the appellant  was  dependent  upon  the  sponsor
    rather than the other  way  around.   It  is,  therefore,  perhaps  not
    surprising that the judge did not  focus  on  that  piece  of  evidence
    either.   The  evidence  was  very  limited  and,  in  considering  the
    relationship between the appellant and sponsor, there is no  reason  to
    assume that the judge did not have that limited evidence well in  mind.
    It would, in any event, not establish any existing  dependency  as  the
    appellant does not  provide  support,  of  the  nature  sought  by  the
    sponsor, at present.  If anything, it contemplates future dependency if
    the appellant were in the UK rather than current dependency whilst  the
    appellant is in Nepal.  In my judgment, the judge  did  not  materially
    err in law in the way proposed by Mr Jaisri in ground 4.

46. Standing back, I accept Mr Kotas' submission  that  the  judge,  having
    properly directed himself  in  law,  took  into  account  all  relevant
    factors and reached a reasonable and rational decision based  upon  the
    evidence available.  The fact of the matter was that there were gaps in
    the evidence relevant to the issue of dependency and support and  there
    was a paucity of evidence concerning the appellant's  circumstances  in
    Nepal, including a witness statement from him.  In those circumstances,
    the judge's findings were ones which were properly open to him on  that
    evidence and his conclusion that  the  appellant  had  not  established
    "family life" with the sponsor in the UK was one properly open  to  him
    and is legally sustainable.

Decision

47. For the above reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  to  dismiss
    the appellant's appeal under Art 8 did not involve  the  making  of  an
    error of law.  The decision, therefore, stands.

48. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.


                                                                      Signed
