For the appellant:     Mr C Timson, instructed by Latitude Law
For the respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  O'Hagan  promulgated  11.7.18,  dismissing  his  appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  23.3.18,  to
    refuse his human rights application for LTR on the basis of family life
    with his mother.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Mailer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    6.8.18.



Error of Law

 3. For the reasons set out below, I find that there was no error of law in
    the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to
    require it to be set aside.

 4. In lodging his Notice and Grounds of appeal against the decision of the
    respondent, the appellant asked for his appeal to  be  decided  on  the
    basis of  the  papers  without  an  oral  hearing  and  it  was  listed
    accordingly. On 23.4.18 he was  issued  with  a  notice  requiring  the
    payment of the reduced fee of ï¿½80 for a paper appeal. In due course the
    fee was paid and on 15.5.18  the  tribunal  confirmed  the  appellant's
    appeal would be decided on the papers without a hearing.

 5. However, by letter dated 30.5.18, the appellant's representatives wrote
    to the tribunal asking to change the listing to  an  oral  hearing.  In
    consequence of the request, on 4.6.18 the  tribunal  issued  directions
    requiring the representatives to confirm within 7 calendar days (a) the
    appellant's address, and (b)  whether  it  is  a  suitable  address  to
    receive correspondence. The directions concluded,  "The  Tribunal  will
    consider the application upon receipt of a response."

 6. There was no response to the directions and no additional  fee  for  an
    oral hearing was paid. In consequence, the tribunal continued to  treat
    the appeal as a paper hearing. In June 2018 it  was  was  allocated  to
    Judge O'Hagan who dealt with it on 14.6.18, with  the  appeal  formally
    promulgated 11.7.18. Contrary to the assertion in the grounds,  in  the
    light of the history set out above, there was not material error of law
    in the judge stating at [2] that each party had consented to the appeal
    being decided on the papers. The appellant had failed  to  comply  with
    directions and thus her application for the matter to be dealt with  as
    an oral hearing was never considered or accepted by the Tribunal.

 7. I further note that on the basis of  the  initial  directions  for  the
    appeal as a paper case,  issued  on  15.5.18,  the  appellant  and  her
    representatives were notified that any written evidence and submissions
    she/they wanted to be considered in the making of the decision  had  to
    be sent to the tribunal and served on the  respondent  by  12.6.18.  No
    such evidence or submissions were ever submitted.

 8. It is asserted that the appellant's representatives  responded  to  the
    directions by letter dated 25.6.18.  The  evidence  the  appellant  now
    adduced shows that the letter was delivered on 27.6.18. By  that  stage
    the appeal had already been  allocated  to  and  dealt  with  by  Judge
    O'Hagan sitting in Manchester on 14.6.18, even though the decision  was
    not formally promulgated until 11.7.18. The letter was sent to the  IAC
    Birmingham and did not make its way to  Manchester  until  28.6.18,  by
    which time it was far too late.

 9. Mr Timson argued that  the  judge  dealing  with  the  case  failed  to
    properly apply Rule 25. However, even if the judge was aware  that  the
    appellant changed her mind and wanted the appeal to be dealt with at an
    oral hearing, which is not clear, the directions issued in relation  to
    the application for change had not been complied with. Pursuant to Rule
    25(e), the tribunal is entitled to dispense with a  hearing  where  the
    party has "failed to comply with a provision of these Rules, a practice
    direction or a direction and the Tribunal is satisfied that in all  the
    circumstances, including the extent of the failure and any reasons  for
    it, it is appropriate to determine the appeal without  a  hearing."  No
    reason had been provided for failure  to  comply  with  the  directions
    within the 7 days allowed and not until some three  weeks  had  elapsed
    and no additional fee had been paid. In the circumstances, even if  the
    judge was aware of the request for a change, there was no proper  basis
    on which the tribunal should have adjourned for an oral hearing.

10. In the circumstances, I find no procedural irregularity or  unfairness,
    and no error of law  requiring  the  decision  to  be  set  aside.  The
    appellant failed to comply  with  directions  and  in  consequence  the
    appeal  was  decided  on  the  papers  on  the  basis  of  the  limited
    information in the Tribunal's case file. No error of law is disclosed.

11. It remains open to the appellant to make a fresh application for  Leave
    to Remain.

Decision

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order  pursuant  to  rule  13(1)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure Rules 2014.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.






Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
pursuant to section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
