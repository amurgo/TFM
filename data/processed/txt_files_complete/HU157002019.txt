For the Appellant:     Mr Moksud, Counsel instructed by direct access
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Jamaica born on the 11th May 1974.   She
    appeals with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    (Judge Thorne) dated the  28th  October  2020  to  dismiss  her  appeal
    against the Respondent's decision to  refuse  to  grant  her  leave  to
    remain on 'private life' grounds under Article 8 ECHR.

 2. The basis of the Appellant's claim before the First-tier  Tribunal  was
    that a combination of factors meant that it would  be  disproportionate
    to refuse to grant her leave. These factors were

      a) that she had lived in this country a long  time  and  had  a  well-
         established private life here;

      b) she had nothing to return to in Jamaica and continued  to  fear  an
         abusive ex- partner;

      c) as a gay  woman  she  would  face  very  significant  obstacles  to
         integration in  Jamaica  where  societal  attitudes  are  generally
         virulently homophobic.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal considered  the  Appellant's  case  within  the
    Razgar framework. It accepted that she had a private life here and that
    the decision to refuse her leave interfered with that private life. The
    Tribunal directed itself  that  the  decision  was  taken  lawfully  in
    pursuit of a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) and so the only question
    to be decided was whether it was a  disproportionate  response  to  the
    need to protect the economy.

 4. At its ï¿½48 the Tribunal sets out various factors weighing in favour of,
    and against, the Appellant.  It specifically had regard to the  'public
    interest' factors set out in Part 5A of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.  It rejected her evidence that she was  afraid  of
    her ex-partner in Jamaica, noting that she had  never  made  an  asylum
    claim on that basis.  The Tribunal found that the Appellant would  have
    support in Jamaica, inter alia from her own adult  daughter  who  still
    resides there. Although she did have friends  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    those relationships could be maintained by telephone or visits.

 5. The Appellant drafted her  own  grounds  of  appeal.    Her  complaint,
    shortly stated, is that despite her sexuality having been  relied  upon
    before the First-tier Tribunal the  matter  is  not  addressed  in  the
    decision.   In granting  permission  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lever
    observed that the decision is  "light"  in  its  consideration  of  the
    evidence. In subsequent directions made by the  Upper  Tribunal,  Judge
    Rintoul said this:

         "The core of the appellant's challenge to the decision of the First-
         tier Tribunal appears to be that it  failed  to  consider  evidence
         relating to her sexual orientation, a matter raised in the  grounds
         of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. That appears to me  to  be  a
         'new matter' for the purposes of section  85  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 .... I note that Judge Thorne  does
         not appear to have considered  whether  a  'new  matter'  has  been
         raised"

 6. The Secretary of State's written response to the grant  of  permission,
    drafted on the 18th December  2020  by  Senior  Presenting  Officer  Ms
    Willocks-Briscoe, offers a defence to the omission by pointing  to  the
    Secretary of State's advice to  the  Appellant  (given  at  an  earlier
    unspecified time) that if she was worried about being gay  in  Jamaica,
    she should claim asylum. Before me Mr McVeety did not pursue that  line
    of reasoning. He realistically accepted that being gay in this  context
    would also be relevant to a consideration of whether  there  are  "very
    significant obstacles to integration" and as  such  if  the  point  was
    raised, it was incumbent on Judge Thorne to have  at  least  considered
    whether it was a new matter.

 7. I have seen the grounds of  appeal  that  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Mrs Henry clearly therein raised  fears  about  returning  to
    Jamaica and being able to integrate there as a gay woman.  This was not
    a matter considered by Judge Thorne. I am satisfied that  the  omission
    to consider whether this was a 'new matter', and therefore  whether  it
    should be permitted to form part of the Article 8 case, was material to
    the Tribunal's decision. I therefore set the decision,  insofar  as  it
    relates to paragraph 276ADE(1), aside.

 8. Upon remaking I need not consider any of the  matters  which  concerned
    the parties before the First-tier Tribunal.  That  is  because,  as  of
    today's date, Mrs Henry has spent in excess  of  20  years  continually
    resident in the UK and as such  prima  facie  qualifies  for  leave  to
    remain under  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iii).   It  was  accepted  that  she
    arrived in the UK on the 11th June 2001, and  there  is  no  suggestion
    that she has ever left; the Secretary of State has not  identified  any
    'suitability' issues under 276ADE(1)(i). The fact that Mrs Henry  today
    qualifies for leave to remain under the Rules  means  that  the  public
    interest imperative in the original refusal  falls  away,  and  in  the
    absence of any countervailing factors, I  allow  the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds.




    Decisions and Directions

 9. I note that the application for permission to appeal was two  days  out
    of time. Mrs Henry explained that she had been  hampered  in  preparing
    her appeal because she was shielding as a result of the pandemic.  This
    application to extend time was not expressly addressed by Judge Rintoul
    when he granted permission. Although it is implicit in his  grant  that
    he accepted that time should be extended, for the sake of  completeness
    I am satisfied that it would be in the interests of justice  to  extend
    time and admit the application.

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and it
    is set aside.

11. I remake the decision in the appeal by  allowing  it  on  human  rights
    grounds.

12. There is no order for anonymity.
