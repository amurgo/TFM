For the Appellants: Miss N Rogers, counsel instructed by Irving & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr M Blundell, Home Office Presenting Officer

1. The ordinary natural meaning of "direct descendants" in  the  Immigration
   (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  and  Directive  2004/38/EC
   includes grandchildren (and remoter issue in the direct line).
2. The meaning of  the  EEA  Regulations,  which  faithfully  reproduce  the
   Directive on  this  point,  being  clear,  there  is  no  scope  for  re-
   interpreting them  on  the  basis  of  any  perceived  absurdity  in  the
   consequences.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is a case where  the  Tribunal  has  ordered  reconsideration  of  a
   decision of Immigration Judge Geraint Jones QC, sitting at Surbiton on 17
   July 2006. The judge had  dismissed  the  European  Economic  Area  [EEA]
   family members' appeals by citizens of India,  respectively  12  and  not
   quite seven at the date of the decision under appeal. The decision, on 10
   August 2005, had been  to  refuse  them  family  permits  to  join  their
   Portuguese grandfather (Mr C), who was exercising his EEA rights to be in
   this country, having come here from Portugal. The  Tribunal  thought  the
   judge might have made an error of law in his  interpretation  of  "direct
   descendants" in reg. 7(1)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
   Regulations 2006 [the EEA Regulations]: the complete paragraph follows.

      7. -(1) Subject to paragraph (2), for the purposes of these
         Regulations the following persons shall be treated as the family
         members of another person-

         (a) his spouse or his civil partner;
         (b) direct descendants of his, his spouse or his civil partner who
         are-
               (i) under 21; or
               (ii) dependants of his, his spouse or his civil partner;

         (c) dependent direct relatives in his ascending line or that of his
         spouse or his civil partner;
         (d) a person who is to be treated as the family member of that
         other person under paragraph (3).




2. Having dismissed these boys' mother's appeal,  for  reasons  which  Miss
   Rogers did not seek to have reconsidered, the judge went on to deal with
   their cases as follows:

      "18.  I next turn to consider the appeals made by ..., [Mrs  I's]  two
         children. They are each under the age of 21,  as  I  so  find.  The
         argument advanced by Ms Rogers is that they must  each  succeed  in
         their  respective  appeals  because  they  come  within   paragraph
         7(1)(b)(i) of the 2006 Regulations. The issue then arises as to the
         true and proper construction of that part of  paragraph  5  of  the
         2006 Regulations. It arises in this way. Ms Rogers submits that  as
         [Mr C's] grandsons are his descendants and are under  21  years  of
         age, they plainly come within paragraph 7 of the 2006  Regulations.
         However, that depends upon the  true  and  proper  construction  of
         paragraph 7(1)(b) of the Regulations, which  is  in  the  following
         terms:

                 "Subject to  paragraph  (2),  for  the  purposes  of  these
            Regulations the following  persons  shall  be  treated  as  the
            family members of another person... direct descendants of  his,
            his spouse or civil partner who are under 21."

                  Ms Rogers submits that paragraph 7(1)(b) applies to any of
         [Mr C's] descendants. If Ms Rogers is correct in that submission it
         would have the bizarre result that [Mr  C's]  grandchildren,  under
         the age of 21, may be entitled to a residence  permit  whereas  his
         own daughter (his grandsons' mother) is  not  so  entitled.  In  my
         judgment that gives a good guide to the construction of  that  part
         of the Regulations. Upon its wording it  is  clear  that  paragraph
         7(1)(b) does not apply to all descendants of  [Mr  C].  It  applies
         only to  his  "direct  descendants".  If  it  applied  to  all  his
         descendants, the word "direct" would be otiose. If  that  word  was
         deliberately inserted by the draftsmen of the Regulations, it  must
         add meaning to the word "descendants". Ms Rogers submitted that  it
         could  not  be  construed  so  as  to  restrict  the  category   of
         descendants to those removed by only one generation. She  put  that
         submission on  the  basis  that  in  paragraph  7(2)  of  the  2006
         Regulations special provision is made for the family members  of  a
         student and provides that a person is not to be treated as a family
         member unless he/she is the dependant child of student. I am unable
         to take any significant guidance from that part of the Regulations.
         That is because paragraph 7(2) of the 2006 Regulations is  designed
         to cut down the entitlement under paragraph 7(1). It does  that  by
         providing that, if the sponsor is a student, the descendant must be
         a dependant child of the student. In other  words,  it  excludes  a
         student's children who are under 21 but who are not dependant  upon
         the student.

      19. If the construction contended for by  Ms  Rogers  is  correct,  it
         would give rise to the bizarre result that [Mr  C's]  own  daughter
         must fail in her application whereas his grandchildren, who are  in
         no way dependent upon him (as I so find), would  succeed  in  their
         application. In considering that argument I must consider the whole
         reasoning behind  these  Regulations.  They  are  designed  by  the
         European Community to give effect to the free movement  of  workers
         by preventing member states from excluding family members  of  such
         workers so that such workers are not  discouraged  from  exercising
         the right of free movement because their family members may not  be
         able to join them.  There  is  no  sense  whatsoever  in  having  a
         provision that prevents a worker's daughter from  joining  him  but
         which permits his grandchildren to join him.  Accordingly,  I  give
         meaning to the word "direct" which appears immediately prior to the
         word "descendant" in paragraph 7(1)(b) of the 2006  Regulations  by
         construing it as limiting the dependence [sic] there referred to as
         dependants who are not removed from the relevant EEA worker by more
         than one generation.  Any  other  construction  of  that  paragraph
         renders the word "direct" devoid of meaning and entirely otiose."




3. Miss Rogers's argument before us was essentially the same as she had put
   before the immigration judge, while Mr Blundell asked us to  uphold  the
   judge's reasons  for  dismissing  these  appeals.  The  only  additional
   feature of the hearing before us was an invitation from Miss  Rogers  to
   consider the text of article 2(2) of the  Directive  2004/38/EC  of  the
   European Parliament and of the Council, on which the EEA Regulations are
   based. What the relevant part of the English text of article  2(2)  says
   is this:

      "Family member" means:

      c) the direct  descendants  who  are  under  the  age  of  21  or  are
         dependants ...;
      d) the dependent direct relatives in the ascending line ...




4. These words are reproduced, with no significant changes, in reg.  7(1)(b)
   and (c) of the EEA Regulations, and we see no reason  to  return  to  the
   Directive. We did not need Miss  Rogers's  (entirely  properly  produced)
   dictionary definitions to take judicial notice that the ordinary  natural
   meaning  of  "direct  descendants"  in  English  includes  children   and
   grandchildren (to the nth generation), but excludes  (great)  nieces  and
   nephews; just as  "direct  relatives  in  the  ascending  line"  includes
   parents  and  grandparents  (with  any  more  remote  ancestors  who  may
   fortunately still be alive), but excludes (great) aunts and  uncles.  The
   question is whether the judge was right  in  taking  the  view  that  the
   drafting of the EEA Regulations compelled a different interpretation.



5. Regulation 7(2) does indeed cut down the entitlement,  in  the  case  of
   students' descendants, to their dependent children; so the draftsman  of
   the EEA Regulations was quite astute to limit rights in this  way  where
   he so intended. The only basis for finding,  by  necessary  implication,
   that the author of the Directive, and the draftsman of  the  Regulations
   who followed him, did intend to limit "direct descendants" to  the  next
   generation only, is in the judge's perception that "There  is  no  sense
   whatsoever in having a provision that prevents a worker's daughter  from
   joining him but which permits his grandchildren to join him."



6. Miss Rogers  suggested  that,  contrary  to  that  view,  modern  family
   arrangements might often dictate that children should be looked after by
   grandparents past working age, even though they would not  otherwise  be
   dependent on them: of course if these boys' mother had been dependent on
   her father, then she too would have been entitled to join him. We  could
   also well imagine the European draftsman having it in  mind  to  provide
   that grandchildren of up to undergraduate age should be entitled to join
   their grandparents for general  support  and  if  necessary  supervision
   during their studies, without their parents needing to come too.



7. However, these are  all  matters  of  speculation,  because  both  sides
   disclaimed the existence of any travaux pr�paratoires which  might  have
   suggested what the European Union meant to provide, and  the  indigenous
   draftsman loyally followed. As Mr Blundell realistically  accepted,  the
   very absence of such material tends to suggest that no  special  meaning
   was intended. In our view, the result contended for by Miss  Rogers  was
   not by any means so absurd as the judge thought; at worst  it  might  be
   described as a little untidy.



8. As a matter of  principle,  though,  the  EEA  Regulations  fall  to  be
   construed like any other statutory instrument: if there  were  any  room
   for doubt as to whether they provided  for  what  was  intended  by  the
   primary legislation, in this case the Directive, then the Tribunal, like
   any other court, would be free to take a wider view of what was  or  was
   not rational in the way they did so. In this case, the  EEA  Regulations
   followed the Directive precisely, and in our view there was no scope for
   the  immigration  judge  to  consider  whether  or   not   the   factual
   consequences of the clear terms of the primary European legislation were
   in his view absurd. It would of course have been another matter  if  its
   terms were not clear; but they are.



9. It follows that the appeals of both these appellants against refusal  of
   a family permit are allowed; but we should not leave  the  case  without
   saying one or two things about what  happened  at  first  instance.  The
   judge was not helped by counsel and the presenting officer agreeing that
   the  case  fell  to  be  dealt  with  under  the  previous  (2000)   EEA
   Regulations. Quite rightly, he referred to schedule  4  of  the  present
   (2006) ones, which provides at paragraph 3(1) that all  applications  of
   this kind pending at their commencement on  30  April  2006  are  to  be
   treated as made under them; and that is what he did.




10. While Miss Rogers, as we should expect, was prepared for that  decision,
   to the extent that she was able to make the submissions she wished under
   the present Regulations, the judge does not seem to have been helped  on
   this by the presenting officer, (not Mr Blundell).  It  is  not  in  the
   public interest that any tribunal should be left to decide a significant
   issue of law in the absence of argument on both  sides;  but  we  should
   like to express our appreciation of the trouble  the  immigration  judge
   took to do so, which has in the end led to  this  point  being  properly
   argued before us.



Decision

The original Tribunal made a material error of law. The appellants'  appeals
are allowed.
