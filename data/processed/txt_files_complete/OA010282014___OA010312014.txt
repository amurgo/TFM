Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Lawrence Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms S Pararajasingam


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission a decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal, Judge  Lawrence,  promulgated  on  11th  February  2015,
    allowing the appeal of the Appellants against a refusal of their  entry
    clearance applications as elderly dependent relatives of two  of  their
    children,  a  son  and  a  daughter,  now  resident  British  citizens.
    Permission was granted on the basis that it was arguable that the judge
    had failed to give adequate reasons that the required level of care  is
    not available in Sri Lanka or why the Appellants, who contend that they
    can afford to maintain their parents in the United Kingdom, even in the
    event of their requiring care in a care home here, could not afford  to
    continue to care for their parents in Sri Lanka.

 2. There is no cross appeal challenging the decision on other grounds.

 3. There was no application to submit additional evidence.

 4. The matter proceeded on submissions.

 5. Mr Tarlow briefly elucidated the grounds as above.

 6. Ms Pararajasingam reiterated the submissions set out  in  the  Rule  24
    response  to  the  point  that  the  judge  had  the  evidence  of  the
    Appellants' medical conditions/ailments and the medical  professional's
    recommendations, to the point that the Appellants needed to be close to
    their children, and receiving their care  in  the  family  environment.
    The Respondent's contention that an ability to meet the maintenance and
    accommodation requirements in the United Kingdom result necessarily  in
    the Sponsors' ability to afford care, if needs be in a  care  home,  in
    Sri Lanka.

My Consideration and Findings

 7. The Respondent in this case did not dispute that the Appellants require
    long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks.  The detail of  that
    concession and the medical evidence upon which it is based is  set  out
    in the Entry Clearance Officer's decision letters,  and  reiterated  at
    paragraph  8  of  the  judge's  determination.   In   short   Professor
    Dissanayake suffered a stroke in 2012 causing some brain damage leading
    to disability in the use of his limbs and evident in his gait.   It  is
    difficult for him to  feed  himself,  dress  himself  or  walk  without
    assistance.    He   has   osteoarthritis,   hypertension   and   atrial
    fibrillation and memory difficulties.  The second Appellant is his wife
    and she has suffered from cervical spondylosis since 1994 and  diabetes
    and hypertension.   Their  conditions  are  chronic,  debilitating  and
    deteriorating and adversely impacted by old age.

 8. The judge notes that the Appellants have  engaged  care  workers.   The
    judge asserts, "I need to be  satisfied  the  Appellants  are  able  to
    obtain the required level of care in the country where they are  living
    or it is not available or there is no person in that  country  who  can
    reasonably  provide  it."   It  is  self  evident  that  the  rule   is
    incorrectly set out and so the judge self misdirects.

 9. The judge continues on to find that whilst medical  and  domestic  care
    assistance is available, the risk of further strokes in connection with
    the first Appellant or of  hypoglycaemic  attacks  in  respect  of  the
    second Appellant require healthcare workers to  be  able  to  recognise
    symptoms and attend to them, or call for  medical  assistance  quickly,
    and concludes  that  he  is  not  satisfied  "that  such  expertise  is
    available to the Appellants."   In doing  so  the  judge  continues  to
    incorrectly self direct in terms of the requirements of the rule.

10. The judge sets out at paragraph 11

         "11.     The Appellants are individuals.  They are  elderly.   They
             are infirmed.  They have needs, fears and thoughts.  They  are
             aware that they are suffering from chronic medical  conditions
             without prospect of cure.  They have three  children,  two  in
             the UK and one in Canada.  They have no relatives in Sri Lanka
             who could care for them.  On a human level, I  note  that  the
             Appellants must feel severe mental and emotional  trauma  that
             they are not in the care of their loved ones, their  children.
             This is not a determinant but a fact which carries weight."

11. Further at paragraph 12

         "12.     It is possible of course to place the Appellants  in  care
             homes.  However, that is not the answer.  As I have  indicated
             the Appellants are elderly  and  infirmed  and  needing  care.
             They are in need of loving care  from  their  children.   They
             need to be living in a loving environment, which a  care  home
             will be unable to provide.  ...".

12. The judge then notes that the Sponsors indicated to the Respondent that
    they are unable to support the Appellants should they be  placed  in  a
    care home, and continues to find that the Appellants' Sponsors are able
    to  meet  the  financial  and   accommodation   requirements   "without
    inconvenience" in the United Kingdom.  The appeals  are  allowed  under
    the Immigration Rules.  The judge relies on the case of R (Forrester) v
    SSHD [2008] EWHC 2307.  That lends no assistance to the Appellants.  It
    was an  in-country  relationship  of  marriage  involving  a  child,  a
    relationship which was established when the Appellant was in the United
    Kingdom lawfully, and an application refused only  because  the  cheque
    submitted with the application had bounced.  The case did  not  concern
    the Immigration Rules currently under consideration  and  preceded  the
    implementation of these Rules by some considerable margin.   Whilst  it
    is right to say that a tick box mentality should never be adopted  when
    the factual matrix of an application concerns relationships,  the  bold
    fact is that patterns of immigration  result  in  difficult  situations
    where families are separated across the globe and when as here  parents
    become elderly and infirm.  The necessary use of care homes  for  loved
    ones whether here or in Sri Lanka is frequently  beset  with  emotional
    disturbance for all involved.

13. Reading the decision as  a  whole  it  is  clear  that  the  judge  has
    concluded that the care available in Sri Lanka is not adequate  because
    it is not provided in the loving environment of the family home of  the
    Appellants'  children.   Although  he  notes  that  that   is   not   a
    determinative factor, reading the decision in the  round  it  is  plain
    that it is the absence  of  that  environment  which  the  judge  finds
    enables these Appellants to satisfy the requirements of the Rules.

14. At page 69 of the Appellants' bundle there is a comparator  in  respect
    of the current care arrangements asserting that total expenses  in  Sri
    Lanka, including the care currently received, including food, utilities
    and so on, results in total expenses of 65,000 Sri Lankan rupees.   The
    care  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  assessed,  again  including   food,
    contributions towards a cleaner, medicine of �42.50 and doctor's visits
    of �62.50, as totalling �325 a month.  At  page  70  a  full-time  home
    nursing calculation provides  total  expenses  of  140,000  Sri  Lankan
    rupees and, through the provision of medical insurance at �375 a  month
    a British cost of �700. In respect of a residential care  home  in  Sri
    Lanka it is stated at page 71 that the  total  expenses  in  Sri  Lanka
    would  be  170,000  Sri  Lankan  rupees,  as  opposed  to   care   home
    accommodation costing �700 a month in  the  UK,  the  additional  costs
    factored in by the family which are asserted to make  the  position  in
    Sri Lanka untenable are the travel costs associated with the visits  of
    the children.  The basis of the  comparisons  made  in  the  bundle  of
    evidence is not based on the rules.

15. The "yardstick"  is  the  affordability  of  care,  and  whilst  future
    provision is part of that assessment the relevant date of assessment is
    the date of decision.

16. The contested requirements are set out below:

17. E-ECDR.2.4. The applicant or, if the applicant and  their  partner  are
    the sponsor's parents or grandparents, the applicant's partner, must as
    a result of age, illness or disability require long-term personal  care
    to perform everyday tasks.

18. E-ECDR.2.5. The applicant or, if the applicant and  their  partner  are
    the sponsor's parents or grandparents, the applicant's partner, must be
    unable, even with the practical and financial help of the  sponsor,  to
    obtain the required level of care in the country where they are living,
    because-

          a) it is not available and there is no person in that country who
             can reasonably provide it; or

          b) it is not affordable.

19. The reality is as stated by the Entry Clearance Manager, the  provision
    of care in Sri Lanka is affordable particularly taking account  of  the
    assistance of relatives here, it is available, and in circumstances  of
    old age as described here it cannot be said there is no person, whether
    by provision through a care home or care workers in Sri Lanka  who  can
    reasonably provide it.  The fact that the sponsors are here and want to
    care for their parents, and their parents want them to provide it, does
    not mean that others cannot reasonably provide it. The burden is on the
    Appellants, the standard is the balance of probabilities, and,  on  the
    evidence they have not discharged it so as to show that even  with  the
    practical and financial help of the sponsors, they are unable to obtain
    the required level of care required in Sri Lanka.

20. For all the reasons above the judge's decision is vitiated by  material
    legal  error,  flawed  by  incorrect  self-direction,  a   failure   to
    appreciate the appropriate standard  and  burden,  and  the  making  of
    findings which are unsustainable on  the  evidence.  I  set  aside  the
    decision.

21. Directions had previously been given to the point  that  in  the  event
    that I found an error of law I would proceed to remake the decision  on
    the evidence as it was before the first tier, and both  representatives
    submitted that   I should do so. For the reasons I have set out  above,
    in remaking the decision I find that the  rules  are  not  met,  and  I
    dismiss the appeal.

Notice of Decision

22. For all the reasons set out above I set aside the decision  and  remake
    it dismissing the Appellants' appeal on Immigration Rules grounds.

23. No anonymity direction is made.
