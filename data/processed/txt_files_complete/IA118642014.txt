                                     and

                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The relevant facts are set out in a letter I sent to the parties on  30
    October 2014.

         "In this appeal the (original) appellant succeeded before the First-
         tier Tribunal to the extent that the decision  refusing  him  leave
         was set aside on the grounds that it was unlawful.  The  First-tier
         Tribunal did not allow the  appeal  substantively  or  direct  that
         leave (or other status) be granted.


         The Secretary of State sought and obtained permission to appeal  to
         this Tribunal, on grounds that are more than arguable.  However  in
         the mean time the original appellant has been granted  a  residence
         card as a family member of an EEA national, and no longer wishes to
         pursue the original application.


         There  is  clearly  no  purpose  in  the  matter  being  determined
         substantively by this Tribunal.  The original appellant has  sought
         to 'withdraw his appeal': but that he cannot do as  the  appeal  to
         the Upper Tribunal is not his appeal.  In order  to  avoid  further
         delay and expense I propose to  issue  a  determination  without  a
         hearing, the decision in  which  will  be  formally  to  allow  the
         Secretary of State's appeal, whilst observing that the  outcome  of
         these proceedings should not, in the circumstances, be  treated  as
         constituting a reasoned decision on any  element  of  the  case  of
         either party.


         Any proposal to the contrary will be considered if received  within
         21 days of the date of this letter."


 2. There has been no response.

 3. The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.  That decision  should  not
    be regarded as a reasoned decision on any  element  of  either  party's
    case.

                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL

                                                      Date: 16 December 2014
