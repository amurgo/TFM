                                   Between

                            LATEEF ADEBISI TERIBA
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL
       RULES 17(5), THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

   1.   Mr Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer,  representing  the
      Respondent, indicated  at  the  beginning  of  the  hearing  that  the
      Respondent wished to withdraw the decision to  remove  the  Appellant,
      which is the decision under appeal. This was notice given  under  Rule
      17(1)(b) that the Respondent was withdrawing her  case.  He  indicated
      that the Respondent wished  to  make  a  fresh  decision  which  would
      encompass consideration of the deportation order signed in respect  of
      Mrs Teriba and the fact the couple's daughter has now resided  in  the
      UK in excess of 7 years. Mr Davison, Counsel for the Appellant, having
      taken instructions from the Appellant, indicated  that  the  Appellant
      did not oppose such a course being taken.


   2.   In the circumstances that both parties are content  I  have  decided
      that this is not a  case  in  which,  notwithstanding  the  respondent
      withdrawing her case, it is appropriate to proceed  to  determine  the
      appeal and re-make the First-tier Tribunal's decision. The  appeal  is
      therefore at an end.


                               Signed                 Date 18 September
                                   2014




                               Neil Froom, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the
                               Upper Tribunal
