Representation:
For the Appellants:    Miss J Fisher, Counsel, instructed Alsters Kelley
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication  of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the appellants.
    Breach of this order can be punished as a contempt  of  court.  I  make
    this order  because  the  appeals  concern  children  who  are  Chinese
    nationals and raise questions about how they would be treated in  China
    because their parents are not married to each other  and  because  they
    are part of a family unit including  two  children.  I  see  no  public
    interest in identifying the children. Their parents cannot be named  in
    order to preserve the children's privacy.

 2. The appellants are nationals of China.  They appealed to the First-tier
    Tribunal a decision of the respondent to remove them  from  the  United
    Kingdom having refused them leave to remain.

 3. The first appellant was born on February 1970 and so is  now  about  45
    years old. The second appellant was born in 1977 and so is now 37 years
    old.  She is the first appellant's female partner. The third and fourth
    appellants are their minor children.  They were both born in the United
    Kingdom.  The third appellant was born in December 2005 and so is now 9
    years old and the fourth appellant was born in June 2012 and so is  now
    2� years old.

 4. There is some disagreement about exactly when the first two  appellants
    entered the United Kingdom and in what capacity but it seems clear that
    the second appellant had a visitor's visa valid from  10  January  2002
    until July 2002 and that the first and second  appellants  applied  for
    work permit visas on 27 October 2014. The applications were refused and
    they chose to remain in the United  Kingdom  without  permission.  They
    made no attempt to regularise their stay until 3 April 2013  when  they
    made the application leading to the refusals that are  the  subject  of
    this appeal.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal and it is  appropriate  to
    look carefully at the First-tier Tribunal's determination.

 6. Although the notice of appeal lists four grounds I turn to the skeleton
    argument relied on before the First-tier Tribunal (not prepared by Miss
    Fisher) to see how the case was put.   Essentially  it  was  maintained
    that the decision was a disproportionate interference with the  private
    and family  lives  of  each  of  the  appellants  and  that  the  third
    appellant's  appeal  should  have  been  allowed   under   the   Rules,
    particularly 276ADE(1)(iv) of HC 395.

 7. There is reference at paragraph 2 of the skeleton argument to  "Article
    3 ECHR rights" but the grounds for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal make it pain at paragraph 5 that Article 3 was raised "as part
    of the argument in relation to Article 8".

 8. The First-tier Tribunal's findings begin at paragraph 9. The First-tier
    Tribunal decided that the first two appellants had left China at  about
    the same time separately but intending to make a life together  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The second appellant's parents did not approve of  the
    first appellant and wanted her to marry someone else.

 9. The third appellant was conceived after the first  appellant  had  been
    refused a work permit.  The first appellant admitted that they did  not
    want to apply to regulate their status in the United Kingdom until they
    had a child who had accrued  seven  years  residence.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal  rejected  the  contention   that   the   second   appellant's
    pregnancies were other than planned and desired.

10. The first two appellants started to attend an Anglican church  near  to
    their home in 2004.   The  first  appellant  worked  irregularly  in  a
    factory, on a farm and in a takeaway food shop.  He was  last  employed
    full-time in 2010. He now makes money petty trading, buying items  from
    second hand shops and reselling them at car boot  sales.  Sometimes  he
    distributes leaflets for the take away food industry.  He has become  a
    community governor of a primary school.  Apparently he was nominated by
    a vicar.  Both the first  and  second  appellants  have  hosted  annual
    Chinese New Year events in local schools.

11. The second appellant has done some factory work but does not work now.

12. They live in a house provided by their vicar  who  currently  lives  in
    Malaysia.  They have lived there since 2009.  They pay a rent of  about
    �70 a week.  I assume this is considerably below the market value.

13. Findings about the third appellant may be particularly important and  I
    set them out below:

         "16. The third appellant was born in the UK and has been  here  for
         more than seven years. She has never  been  to  China.  Her  school
         report tells me that she is doing well in her  studies.   (AB  89);
         Whilst  this  report  states  that  she  speaks  Chinese   (presume
         Mandarin) the first and second appellants state that she  does  not
         and this must be an assumption by  the  school.  They  have  always
         conversed with her in English up as they want her to be brought  up
         as a British child. I do not accept the explanation that the report
         mentions Chinese just because the  school  assumed  she  spoke  the
         language. I accept that the third appellant does not have a  fluent
         understanding of any Chinese languages but it would  be  reasonable
         to conclude that she does speak or understand some Chinese language
         as her mother could not speak English when she first arrived in the
         UK and so she must have spoken to her in some other language.

         17.  The letter from solicitors (AB-1) states that RJYZ has  little
         interest in their (her parents) background having no  understanding
         of its relevance to her and no understanding of Chinese culture and
         language and there is no interest shown in this  by  her.  Although
         initially her parents did try and kept information flowing to  her,
         she now only becomes stressed  and  adamant  that  this  is  of  no
         relevance to her. At the hearing the  second  appellant  said  that
         they did not speak Mandarin to her and they wanted the children  to
         grow up speaking English.  When asked what they had told her  about
         China, she said she explained how lucky she was to have  been  born
         here and how bad things were for children in China. Her parents are
         involved in promoting Chinese culture in school and so  I  find  it
         likely that RJYZ has some understanding  of  Chinese  culture.  Her
         mother has also told her about the difficulties children face there
         and how lucky she is to be brought up in England."

14. The First-tier Tribunal asked  itself,  having  referred  to  paragraph
    276ADE(1) of HC 395, if "It would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    applicant to leave the UK".

15. The Tribunal found that the third appellant had some  understanding  of
    the Chinese language and Chinese customs.  She is also a  "model  pupil
    and is a member of the school council".   There were no behavioural  or
    health concerns raised.

16. The third appellant was then 8 years old and  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge found that her best interests lay in her staying with her parents
    who had brought her up.  The  judge  particularly  referred  to  Azimi-
    Moayed and Others (Decisions affecting children; onward appeals) [2013]
    UKUT 197 (IAC) Blake J where the Tribunal revised the existing case law
    about the best interests of children and particularly said at paragraph
    23:

         "(iii)   lengthy residence in a country other  than  the  state  of
             origin  can  lead  to  development  of  social,  cultural  and
             educational ties that it would be inappropriate   to  disrupt,
             in the absence of compelling reasons  to  the  contrary.  What
             amounts to lengthy residence is not clear  cut  but  past  and
             present policies have identified seven  years  as  a  relevant
             period;

         (iv) apart from the terms of  published  policies  and  rules,  the
             Tribunal notes that seven years from aged 4 is  likely  to  be
             more significant to a child than  the  first  seven  years  of
             life.  Very young children are focused on their parents rather
             than their peers and are adaptable;".

17. The First-tier Tribunal then found that it was in the best interests of
    the third appellant to be brought up with her  parents  who  loved  and
    cared for her and she could expect  to  receive  a  good  education  in
    China.  Clearly there would be disruption in removing but the  Tribunal
    found that she could  be expected to learn the language and progress in
    her education and integrate into life there and concluded  "I  do   not
    find that it would be unreasonable for this to be in China".

18. The First-tier Tribunal found that it would not be contrary to  Article
    3 rights to remove the family and there would be no ill-treatment  akin
    to persecution because the first two appellants were not married and no
    risk of persecution  if  the  appellants  continued  their  links  with
    Christianity.

19. The appeal was dismissed.

20. Permission to appeal was given primarily because it was  arguable  that
    the First-tier Tribunal:

         "did not make any clear findings as to whether the decision was  in
         the best interests of the children taking into account the  age  of
         the child and the fact that she was born in the UK  and  has  lived
         [there] for her entire life.  This should  have  been  done  first.
         This is an arguable material error of law."

21. The Secretary of State served a  reply  pursuant  to  Rule  24  of  the
    Procedure Rules.  Paragraph 3 is apt.   The Secretary of State said:

         "The ground on which the  appellants  have  been  given  permission
         amounts to a mere disagreement. The weight which the  Judge  placed
         on factors surrounding the best interests of  the  appellant  RJYZ,
         were  a  matter  for  the  judge.   An  alleged  failure  to  place
         sufficient  weight  on  particular  aspects,  cannot  establish   a
         material error in law. She has properly considered the interests of
         the children, in particular RJYZ who has been in  the  country  for
         over seven years, and has come to the conclusion that her interests
         lie in  continuing  to  reside  with  her  parents,  and  that  her
         interests can continue to be met  by  their  returning  to  China".
         This was a conclusion she was entitled to  arrive  considering  the
         facts and the applying the case law."

22. The bundle before me included an unreported decision of Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Grubb promulgated on 11 December 2013.  It was not  suggested  it
    was authoritative. It was produced as being illustrative of an approach
    to take in a case involving someone from China.

23. There were elements of carelessness in  the  determination  that  Judge
    Grubb considered but  his  decision  is  relevant  to  this  appeal  at
    paragraph 17 where he said:

         "I agree with Mr Manley that the judge was required to grapple with
         the evidence relied upon which showed that the penalties were  high
         for a married couple but were double for a single woman such as the
         appellant.  Mr Manley pointed to a  document  at  page  12  of  the
         bundle which, although dealing with another province, namely Wuhan,
         stated that women who have children out of wedlock could  be  fined
         more than �17,000.  In addition the document at page 6 to  which  I
         have already made reference states that 'illegal' child  (which  of
         course covers the appellant's child born out of wedlock) is  denied
         all government services including  access  to  schools,  hospitals,
         etc.  Mr Manley accosted that the appellant could not succeed under
         Article 3 of the ECHR but that the judge  had  failed  properly  to
         consider these matters  in  determining  whether  Art  8  would  be
         breached."

24. With respect to Judge Grubb, this decision does  not  bind  me  but  it
    might be thought a particularly pithy explanation of what  this  appeal
    is really all about.

25. I begin by looking at the material before the First-tier Tribunal.

26. The Country of Origin Information Report dated 20 December 2013  refers
    to "provinces and localities imposed fines of various amounts on  unwed
    mothers".  The same report at paragraph 10.14  says  how  national  law
    authorises penalties for violators of the "one  child  policy"  denying
    public health and education benefits to children beyond the first child
    and explains how this had lead to concerns about forced  contraception,
    sterilisation and abortion.

27. The report refers to information published by the BBC in May 2011  that
    twenty babies were said to have been seized under  the  one  child  per
    family policy and made available for international adoption.  There was
    clear evidence that Shanghai Province extracted penalties described  as
    "social maintenance fees" for extra children.  The penalties were at  a
    high level and failure to  pay  them  prevented  the  unofficial  child
    getting  household  registration  which  gave  access  to   citizenship
    benefits.  There is an extract from a BBC News  Asia  Report  dated  17
    January 2014. This includes the assertion: "As many as 20,000,000  boys
    and girls were  born  in  violation  of  the  original  policy.   Their
    families face large fines and the children are denied basic rights."

28. The sane point is developed in an article "Living in China" which  says
    how "illegal" children or  children  who  travel  to  an  area  without
    permission can find themselves unable  to  attend  school.   A  further
    article in BBC News dated 17 January 2014 tells a story of a family who
    have had to pay a fine of almost $10,000  and that across China $3.3 bn
    in similar fines have been  paid.

29. The reference to some 20,000,000 children is, I find, relevant  in  two
    rather different ways.  It clearly shows that there are proper  reasons
    to be concerned about returning people with more than one child because
    there will be additional difficulties but it is also plain  that  there
    are difficulties which a very large number of  people  are  willing  to
    overcome.  It is conceivable that a person might be able to  show  that
    the difficulties of returning would be a  very  weighty  factor  in  an
    Article 8  balancing  exercise  but  this  is  not  a  case  where  the
    appellants  have  gone  to  the  trouble  of  laying   the   evidential
    foundation.  Maybe if they had given a very detailed explanation  about
    where they would have to reside in China or why that was a place  where
    they would be without funds and expected to pay large bills there might
    be something to say but this was not that kind of case.

30. Neither do I understand concerns based on the fact that the  mother  is
    not married to the father in this case.  They exist as a family unit in
    the United Kingdom.  I have every reason to think they  would  want  to
    exist as a family unit in China and I have been pointed to  nothing  to
    indicate that they would not be allowed to live together  as  a  family
    unit in China. The circumstances are quite different from  those  of  a
    woman who allows herself to conceive (or is forced to conceive  by  the
    criminal act of another) when she is in no  position  to  look  to  the
    father for help in bringing up the child.

31. Further it is a feature of the case that the appellants have identified
    themselves with the Anglican Church and want to keep  in  contact  with
    Christians.  I do not think even in this secular age  I  need  specific
    evidence to say that the Christian church encourages  marriage.   There
    is no reason suggested before me why these people cannot marry  or  why
    they would not do that  to  facilitate  the  best  interests  of  their
    children.

32. The First-tier Tribunal Judge clearly had in mind the guidance given in
    AX (Family planning scheme) China CG  [2012]  UKUT  00097  (IAC)  which
    clearly  established  that  returning  children  in  the  circumstances
    described would not normally amount to persecution.  I accept  that  is
    not the same test as relevant to an Article 8 balancing exercise but in
    the absence of evidence that the third appellant and in due course  her
    sister would not be able to get any kind of education  or  even  social
    acceptance in china I do not see how the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    conclusion that removal is proportionality and reasonable  in  all  the
    circumstances could  be said to be wrong in law.

33. I appreciate that the appellants' solicitors have gone to  considerable
    trouble in preparing  a  detailed  bundle  and,  with  the  benefit  of
    hindsight, it may be more helpful if the First-tier Tribunal Judge  had
    said a little more about the material before him.  There  has  probably
    never been a determination written which could not have  been  improved
    and I am not suggesting that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  erred  and
    certainly not erred in law in the way suggested but I do  not  wish  to
    discourage anyone from giving proper and  careful  consideration  to  a
    case wherein the child has to be removed.

34. I see no merit in the suggestion that there was something  wrong  about
    the order in which the First-tier Tribunal Judge went about her task.

35. Judge Kaler clearly recognised that the correct starting  point  is  in
    considering the welfare and best interests of  the  children  (this  is
    what is meant by paragraph 22 of the determination where  she  reminded
    herself of the head note in EA (Article 8 - best interests of a  child)
    Nigeria [2011] UKUT 315) which confirmed that,  in  the  absence  of  a
    contra indication, it is in the best interests of small children to  be
    with their parents.  Her findings on this point are set out  under  the
    heading "Conclusions" and I cannot see how she  can  be  said  to  have
    erred materially or at all.

36. It really comes down to this. The appellants have no right  be  in  the
    United Kingdom or to expect be allowed to remain there  unless  removal
    interferes disproportionately with the private and family  lives.  This
    is reflected but not necessarily wholly embraced by paragraph 276ADE of
    HC 395. The oldest minor appellant has the strongest case here because,
    like all of the children, she is innocent of their  parent's  disregard
    for immigration control. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  considered  the
    evidence and particularly reminded herself that "illegal children" have
    difficulties in China. Having considered all  the  evidence  she  found
    that the  minor  appellants  had  not  shown  that  their  removal  was
    unreasonable. Rather she found it proportionate and she  dismissed  the
    appeals.

37. The appellants have failed to satisfy me that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in law. Putting everything together I find that no error  of  law
    has been established.  I therefore dismiss the appellants' appeals.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed and I make no cost order.
