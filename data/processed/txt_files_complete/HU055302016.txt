For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the remaking of the decision in the Appellant's appeal  against
    the Respondent's refusal of his human rights claim, dated 8th  February
    2016.  This decision follows on from my conclusion that the  First-tier
    Tribunal had materially  erred  in  law  when  initially  refusing  the
    Appellant's appeal (my error of law decision is annexed,  below).  This
    matter had previously been  adjourned  in  order  for  the  Appellant's
    representatives to obtain a medical report and prepare a more  detailed
    witness statement in preparation for the resumed hearing.

 2. A bundle of updated evidence has been provided by the Appellant  and  I
    have admitted  it  pursuant  to  Rule  15(2A)  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    Procedure Rules 2008, without objection from the Respondent.

 3. The core issue in the remaking  of  the  Appellant's  case  relates  to
    whether  there  would  be   "very   significant   obstacles"   to   his
    reintegration  into  Jamaican  society  with  reference  to   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.




The hearing before me

 4. Having had the opportunity of reading and digesting  the  new  evidence
    and discussing maters with Ms Malhotra, Ms Everett took what  I  regard
    as being an entirely fair and sensible view of  the  Appellant's  case.
    She confirmed that she was conceding the appeal on the basis  that,  on
    any view of the evidence as a whole and a relevant legal framework, the
    Appellant  would  indeed  face  "very  significant  obstacles"  to  his
    reintegration into Jamaican society.

 5. In light of this concession I allow the Appellant's appeal on the basis
    that he satisfies the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).

 6. It is now for the Respondent to grant  him  an  appropriate  period  of
    leave.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained  material  errors  of  law
and is set aside.

I re-make the decision in the Appellant's appeal  by  allowing  his  appeal.
The Respondent's refusal  of  his  human  rights  claim  is  unlawful  under
Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.



No anonymity direction is made.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Victor-Mozeli, Counsel, instructed by Invictus
Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant  to  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge R L Walker (the judge), promulgated on 21 June 2017,  by
    which he dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    refusal of his human rights claim, dated 8 February 2016.

 2. The Appellant's case both in respect of the initial claim and on appeal
    was essentially as follows.  In a previous asylum claim dating back  to
    2003 it had been found by an Adjudicator on appeal that  the  Appellant
    was gay and, apparently, had suffered certain problems as a  result  of
    this whilst still in Jamaica.  It seems as though  other  more  serious
    alleged incidents had been rejected by the Tribunal.

 3. It was now said that by virtue of his sexuality he would now face "very
    significant obstacles"  if  attempting  to  reintegrate  into  Jamaican
    society, with reference to paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of  the  immigration
    rules.




The judge's decision

 4. The judge deals with this core issue at [20].  He says as follows:

         "The appellant's evidence is that he will be  at  risk  on  return,
         will have no support or help from family members, no job prospects,
         no accommodation and will not be able to lead an  open  and  normal
         life.  This is an issue that has already  been  considered  in  the
         appellant's asylum application and  later  appeal  in  2003.   That
         determination concluded he was  a  homosexual,  had  been  such  in
         Jamaica, but was not at risk on return.  The  conclusion  therefore
         that it was possible for him to return to Jamaica must still apply.
          The standard of proof in asylum cases is that much lower  than  in
         immigration cases.  If the appellant had failed to show that  there
         was 'a reasonable likelihood of  risk'  then  he  cannot  show  the
         higher standard of 'very significant obstacles'.  The principle set
         out in Devaseelan v SSHD [2003]  applies  and  I  must  follow  the
         findings in the earlier case.  I am entitled to take  into  account
         later facts and events but nothing has been produced today to  show
         that the situation in Jamaica is any worse now than it was in  2003
         for homosexuals.  It follows that the appellant cannot satisfy  sub
         paragraph (vi)."

 5. The judge goes on to consider other evidence about social ties  in  the
    United Kingdom.  It is said that these did not amount to much  and  the
    appeal was duly dismissed.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The grounds focus exclusively on the issue of the Appellant's sexuality
    and paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).  It is said that the judge  was  wrong  to
    have applied Devaseelan in the way he  had  and  that  the  Appellant's
    sexuality would have been sufficient to  constitute  "very  significant
    obstacles".

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ford  on
    25 April 2018.







The hearing before me

 8. Although dated 25 May 2018, a Rule 24 response from the Respondent  had
    not found its way either to my file or into the  hands  of  Ms  Victor-
    Mozeli.  In any event copies were provided to  us  both  by  Mr  Avery.
    Paragraph 2 of that response reads as follows:

             "The respondent does not oppose  the  appellant's  application
             for permission to appeal and invites the Tribunal to determine
             the appeal with a fresh oral (continuance) hearing to consider
             whether the appellant has established significant obstacles to
             return or a breach of his family and private life in the UK."

 9. Despite the somewhat ambiguous  wording  of  that  response,  Mr  Avery
    confirmed that was effectively conceding that the judge had  materially
    erred in law  in  this  case.   Unsurprisingly,  Ms  Victor-Mozeli  had
    nothing to add.




My decision on error of law

10. In my view the Respondent was entirely  correct  to  concede  that  the
    judge had materially erred in law.  This is the case for at  least  two
    reasons.  First, Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702 does not bind the  hands
    of a subsequent Tribunal, contrary to what the judge  appears  to  have
    believed by virtue of his repeated use of the word "must"  in  [20]  of
    his decision.  All  relevant  evidence  and  other  materials  must  be
    considered. Previous findings represent a clear starting point only.

11. Second, although this was not a protection claim, there  were  relevant
    materials which postdated the 2003 determination which the judge should
    have borne in mind, in particular  the  country  guidance  case  of  DW
    [2005] UKAIT 00168 and the principles set out in HJ (Iran) [2010]  UKSC
    31.  A further error in approach by the judge  is  to  have  failed  to
    appreciate  the  material  difference  in  the  questions  posed  by  a
    protection claim on the one hand and a human rights claim on the other.
     In the former, the core issue is that of a risk  of  persecution.   In
    the latter, it is about the  reintegration  into  the  society  of  the
    country of origin and the need to undertake a broad evaluative judgment
    of all relevant circumstances.

12. In light of the above I set the judge's decision aside.




Disposal

13. At first glance this would appear to be a case in  which  I  should  be
    remaking the decision on the evidence now before me.  Ms  Victor-Mozeli
    submitted that this was the correct course of  action.   She  submitted
    that the Appellant's sexuality of itself  was  sufficient  for  him  to
    succeed in his appeal.  However, Mr Avery pointed out that there was no
    copy of the 2003 determination, and thus no clear  factual  picture  of
    what was and what was not accepted at that time, nor was there an up-to-
    date statement from the Appellant dealing with his sexuality and how he
    lived his life in the United Kingdom.  He suggested that oral  evidence
    would be necessary and that there would be questions for the Appellant.
     This could not be undertaken today and a resumed hearing  should  take
    place.

14. With some reluctance I agree with Mr Avery.   It  is  unfortunate  that
    there  has  not  been  more  up-to-date  information  supplied  by  the
    Appellant for the purposes of this  hearing.   Having  said  that,  the
    absence of the 2003 determination is not down to him.  In  my  view  it
    would be right for oral evidence to be received and tested in light  of
    further written evidence.  I am therefore adjourning the appeal.

15. I make it clear that Mr Avery has not suggested that the issue  of  the
    Appellant's sexuality is exclusively a matter for a  protection  claim.
    He acknowledged that it was open to the Appellant to rely on this  core
    issue in respect of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).

16. I issue relevant directions below.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside.

I adjourn this appeal for a resumed hearing before me in due course.
