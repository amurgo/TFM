                                                                 Respondents


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr A Alabi, instructed by Harrison Morgan Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless I shall refer to the parties as they were  termed
    before the First-tier Tribunal that is Mrs Turton and Masters Turton as
    the appellants and the Secretary of State as the respondent.

 2. The appellants are citizens of Nigeria born on 1st September 1968,  3rd
    June 1994 and 31st October 1995 and they had made an application  dated
    30th January 2013 as the wife and sons of someone present  and  settled
    in the UK, for entry clearance to join Mr Charles  Ajayi  Turton  their
    husband and father.

 3. On 26th  February  2013  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  rejected  their
    applications with reference to Appendix  FM,  HC  395  as  amended  and
    paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules.

 4. In relation to the first appellant the Entry Clearance Officer was  not
    satisfied that  the  appellant's  relationship  with  the  sponsor  was
    genuine and subsisting (contrary to E-ECP.2.6 and 2.10) and nor was  he
    satisfied that Mr Turton earned the requisite money under Appendix FM E-
    ECP.3.1,  nor  that  the  first  appellant  met  the  English  language
    requirement E-ECP.4.1.

 5. In relation to the second and  third  appellants  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer rejected the first  appellant's  application  and  additionally
    stated he was not satisfied that Mr Turton had sole responsibility  for
    their upbringing.

 6. In relation to the second appellant the Entry Clearance Officer was not
    satisfied that he was under the age of 18.

 7.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Russell  allowed  the  first  and   third
    appellants' appeals under  the  Immigration  Rules  but  dismissed  the
    second appellant's appeal under the Immigration  Rules.   He  dismissed
    the appeals on human rights grounds.  No challenge was made  by  either
    party to the Judge's determination in relation to the second  appellant
    whose appeal was dismissed.

Application for Permission to Appeal

 8. It was contended by the Secretary of State that the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge erred in law in allowing the appeals under the Immigration Rules.
     He made a material misdirection in law for allowing the appeal despite
    the appellants not providing the specified evidence.

 9. At paragraph 10 of the  determination  the  appellants'  representative
    accepted that the "evidentiary requirements were  an  obstacle".   From
    paragraphs 17 to 20 the judge reiterates that the  appellants  had  not
    provided the necessary evidence and at paragraph 20 the judge exercised
    a discretion so that  the  appeal  could  be  allowed.   The  Rules  of
    specified evidence were comprehensively set out in the  Appendix  FM-SE
    to the Immigration Rules.  These set out what types  of  evidence  were
    required and the periods they covered.   The  Tribunal  had  failed  to
    comply with the Immigration  Rules  and  its  findings  were  therefore
    unsustainable.

10. At paragraph 16 the judge set out the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Rules and materially erred by only applying the financial figure as  if
    two appellants were applying for entry  clearance.   It  was  submitted
    that the judge needed to  consider  the  figure  for  three  appellants
    despite it being dismissed.

11. For these reasons permission to appeal was requested.

12. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge White who
    stated that the judge acknowledged at paragraph 19 of the determination
    that the appellant  had  not  produced  the  documents  required  under
    Appendix FM-SE as specified or in accordance with the directions  given
    by the judge at the hearing and the  judge  nevertheless  purported  to
    exercise a discretion in paragraph 20 to allow the appeal.

The Hearing

13. Ms Holmes submitted that the  judge  had  allowed  the  appeal  without
    seeing the documentary evidence.  At paragraph 9 the judge stated  that
    the documents were not there and the judge directed that  the  P60  and
    bank statements  should  be  provided.   At  paragraph  20  he  took  a
    discretionary decision , which was not open to him, and it was not open
    to him just to ignore the Immigration Rules.

14. The second ground was that the financial requirements were such that he
    needed to take into account two children but he did not.

15. During the course of the hearing Ms Holmes conceded that as  the  first
    child made an application when he was over the age of 18 and could  not
    possibly succeed under paragraph 297 he should not have  been  included
    in the calculation and the judge's finding with respect to  the  amount
    required was correct.

16. At the hearing Ms Holmes helpfully submitted a  copy  of  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules current from 31st January 2013 to 27th February  2013
    which was the date of application to date of decision.

17. Mr Alabi submitted that the correct documents had indeed been submitted
    although initially he stated that he was not sure  that  the  appellant
    could succeed as at the date of hearing as  there  was  an  absence  of
    schedule and absence of P60 and it seems an  absence  of  the  itemised
    bank statement.

18. Appendix FM-SE sets out  the  specified  evidence  applicants  need  to
    provide to meet the requirements of Rules contained in Appendix FM.

19. Further to Appendix FM

    2    In respect of salaried employment in the UK, all of the  following
         evidence must be provided:

    (a)  wage slips covering a period of six months prior to  the  date  of
         application if the applicant has been  employed  by  their  current
         employer for at least 6 months...;

    (b)  a letter from the employers who issued the wage slips at paragraph
         2(a) confirming

         (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;

         (ii) the length of their employment;

         (iii)    the period over which they have  been  or  were  paid  the
             level of salary relied upon in the application and

         (iv) the type of  employment  (permanent,  fixed-term  contract  or
             agency).

    (c)  personal bank statements corresponding to the same periods as  the
         wage slips at paragraph 2(a) showing that the salary has been  paid
         into an account in the name of the person or in  the  name  of  the
         person and their partner jointly.

20. The judge determined at paragraph 16 and  this  appears  to  have  been
    accepted by Ms Holmes that the appellant needed to show  an  income  of
    �22,400 as the first appellant needed the sponsor to show an income  of
    �18,600 (E-ECP.3.2) plus an additional �3,800 for the first child.

21. At paragraph 19 the judge stated

    "This is a frustrating case of the appellant producing almost  all  but
    not all of the documents specified in Appendix FM-SE.   It  is  further
    frustrating that the appellant did not comply with my directions at the
    hearing and produced  further  evidence  before  the  writing  of  this
    determination paragraph".

22. The judge made a direction that the appellant should provide

      a) a schedule of his income and expenditure;

      b) a P60 from ISS;

      c) itemised bank statements; and

      d) a letter from Group Clean conforming to the requirements.

23. The judge continued at paragraph 20

         "Nonetheless I am going to apply the discretion to the requirements
         which the ECO has not applied and accept  that  the  appellant  has
         provided sufficient evidence in the form of contracts of employment
         of Mr Turton, letters from employers,  P60,  wage  slips  and  bank
         statements to show that he is earning in  excess  of  �22,400,  the
         amount specified in Appendix FM as the threshold over which he must
         be earning as gross  annual  income...  while  there  is  no  clear
         overarching picture of Mr Turton's income as Mr  Welling  submitted
         on Mr Welling's calculation Mr Turton is earning somewhere  between
         �21,000 and �22,000 a year."

24. I find that it was not open to the judge  merely  to  depart  from  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and apply his own discretion  and
    if he did so he needed  to  give  an  indication  of  which  particular
    discretion he was applying and his reasoning.

25. There is provision under FM-SE to provide further information  where  a
    document is in the wrong format or is not an original or the  appellant
    has not submitted a specified  document  and  the  decision  maker  may
    contact the applicant or his representative and request  the  document.
    Further if the applicant has submitted a document in the  wrong  format
    or a document that is a copy and not an original the application may be
    granted exceptionally.

26. According to the judge however there was an array of information  which
    was missing and not a specific  document  in  the  wrong  format  or  a
    document missing from a sequence of documents or an original.

27. I therefore find that there was an  error  of  law  and  I  remake  the
    decision.  However I preserve the findings of the judge in  respect  of
    the relationship between the appellants and the sponsor at paragraph 15
    and the finding in relation to the English language test requirement. I
    also note that no challenge  was  made  to  the  determination  in  the
    application for permission to appeal on this point.

28. I  turn  to  a  consideration  of  the  evidence.   I  have  noted  the
    requirements under Appendix FM-SE above and in  particular  noted  that
    within the  entry  clearance  bundle  there  was  a  detailed  list  of
    documentation provided to the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  next  to
    payslips and letter from employer both of which  had  two  ticks  which
    would indicate the payslips and the letters  from  the  employers  were
    supplied from both employments that is the Clarendon  Hotel  and  Group
    Cleaning, and  there  was  a  further  box  ticked  which  stated  bank
    statements covering the last six months were provided.

29. In addition there was a schedule which appeared to be a  caseworker  or
    Entry  Clearance  Officer  calculation  giving  the  financial  details
    summary and  this  identified  that  there  was  an  overall  total  of
    �13,120.73 as "wages checked" but the corroboration was only �9,357.91.
       I conclude that the corroboration must have stemmed  from  the  bank
    statements which were submitted and saw on my trawl  through  the  bank
    statements that indeed nearly �13,200 from the sponsor's  employer  was
    deposited into his bank statements.  These were supplied at the hearing
    before me and which the sponsor confirmed he had submitted to the Entry
    Clearance Officer.

30. As I note those bank statements are indicated on the  ECO  bundle.  The
    Entry Clearance Officer had  ticked  the  box  which  stated  last  six
    months' bank statements and the original bank statements were  provided
    to me both which detailed deposits from the Clarendon  Hotel  and  from
    Group Cleaning, I  conclude  that  this  information  had  indeed  been
    supplied to the Entry Clearance Officer in support of  the  appellant's
    work and related to a time prior to the application.

31. The Entry Clearance Officer calculation giving  the  financial  details
    summary also identified that payslips from both the Clarendon Hotel and
    Group Clean Services for the six month period prior to the  application
    were attached.  These were also in the bundle before me.

32. I can accept that there was significant scrutiny required  to  identify
    and piece together all the evidence but I do conclude that  it  was  an
    error by the judge to state that there  was  not  a  clear  overarching
    picture of the sponsor's income.

33. I turn to the requirement of the letters and consider the  letter  from
    the  Clarendon  Hotel  Blackheath  Limited  of  which  originals   were
    provided.  The letter from  the  Clarendon  Hotel  confirmed  that  the
    appellant was employed on a permanent contract as a kitchen porter  and
    gave the length of his employment  and  when  reading  the  letter  the
    period of time which he had earned a  gross  of  �6.45  per  hour.   He
    worked 37.5 to 40 hours per week.  I find  that  this  letter  conforms
    with the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

34. I turn to the letter of the Group  Cleaning  and  note  that  this  was
    accompanied with a contract from Group Cleaning.  I therefore  consider
    that the letter and contract can  be  read  together  as  the  contract
    constitutes an attachment.  This gives the employment  with  the  hours
    and salary in effect the gross salary of the appellant.  It states  the
    length of time that he has been employed and the  dates  on  which  his
    wage changed.  Only part of this contract was enclosed within the entry
    clearance bundle but I see no reason why the full  contract  would  not
    have been included within the appellant's  application  and  from  this
    contract it is clear that his type of  work  is  permanent  because  it
    states that "the first three  months  of  your  employment  will  be  a
    probationary period".  I have concluded it is permanent and indeed this
    is what the appellant confirmed.

35. I find that the objections raised  in  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    notice of refusal have been addressed.  The appellant does not need  to
    submit a P60 and indeed the application was submitted in  January  2013
    and his P60 would not be issued until three months later  and  yet  the
    requirement was to show financial evidence for the previous six  months
    to the  application.   Therefore  the  P60  would  not  necessarily  be
    relevant.

36. The  bank  statements  clearly  demonstrated  that  the  appellant  was
    receiving regular  wages  from  both  the  Clarendon  Hotel  and  Group
    Cleaning Services and  I  find  that  the  evidence  requirements  were
    fulfilled.  The appellant had been working for the Clarendon Hotel from
    2005 and for Group Cleaning from July 2012 but also  produced  evidence
    from ISS which predated  the  July  2012  start  date  with  the  Group
    Cleaning Services but this was not required.

37.  The  sponsor  needed  to  show  an  annual  income  of  �22,400.   The
    application was made on 30th January 2013 and the decision was made  on
    26th February 2013.  On a calculation of the income  supported  by  the
    evidence which was before the ECO for  the  six  months  prior  to  the
    application there was at least �11,578.32 and  this  stopped  short  in
    January 2013.  This equates to approximately �23,156.64 per  annum  and
    in excess of the required amount.

38. Bearing in mind that I have preserved  the  findings  in  the  previous
    determination and Ms Holmes also conceded that  the  relevant  Rule  in
    relation to the third appellant was paragraph 297C I find that all  the
    requirements to the Immigration Rules have been complied  with  by  the
    first and third appellant and therefore although I found  an  error  of
    law in relation to the determination of Judge Russell I find  that  the
    requirements have been fulfilled to satisfy the Immigration Rules and I
    allow the appeals.  As the first  appellant's  appeal  is  allowed  the
    challenge on sole responsibility falls away.   I make  it  clear  there
    was no challenge by either party to the determination  in  relation  to
    the second appellant and in that respect  the  determination  of  Judge
    Russell shall stand.

Order

The appeals of Mrs Emily Turton and Mr Edward Turton are allowed.

The appeal of Mr Henry Turton remains dismissed.

The fee award made by Judge Russell is preserved.
