Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr S Karim, instructed by M A Consultants (London)
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are nationals of Nigeria. They appealed to  a  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal against the respondent's decision  of  21  June
    2013 refusing leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  The  decision  of
    the  judge  was  to  dismiss  the  appeals.   However  the   appellants
    challenged that decision, and in a determination promulgated on 30 July
    2014 Judge Bruce found errors of law in  the  decision  such  that  the
    matter required to be reheard.

2.   The hearing of this  appeal  before  us  took  place  initially  on  17
    November 2014 when, as on this occasion, we heard submissions  from  Mr
    Karim on behalf of the appellants and  Mr  Bramble  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent.

3.   In light of Mr Bramble's concession at  that  hearing  that  the  third
    appellant  could   succeed  under  paragraph   276ADE(1)(iv)   of   the
    Immigration Rules, on the basis that he was required to  show  no  more
    that he had lived in the United Kingdom for at least  seven  years  and
    that was accepted to be the case, we said that we proposed to allow his
    appeal and as a consequence to allow the other appeals.

4.   Subsequently we received an email from Mr Bramble stating that in  fact
    he had drawn our attention to the wrong provision (HC 760) and that  HC
    820, which had  been  laid  before  Parliament  on  12  December  2012,
    introduced an additional requirement  of  reasonableness  into  such  a
    case.  We invited submissions from Mr Karim as a consequence  of  which
    we concluded that the only option open  to  us  was  to  reconvene  the
    hearing and hear argument on the point as to whether the respondent was
    bound by the concession which she had made and if she was not, what the
    consequences of that were.

5.   Mr Bramble reminded us that  the  application  had  been   made  on  13
    September 2012.  Under HC 670 all that was necessary to be  shown  with
    respect to the oldest child was that he was under 18 and had lived  for
    seven years continually in the United Kingdom, the  application  having
    been made before 13 December 2012.  He had accepted that on that  basis
    the eldest child would succeed and under the terms of  section  117B(6)
    of the 2002 Act, as amended, this would benefit the parents.

6.   However it  was  clear  from  HC  820  that  there  was  an  additional
    requirement to show that it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    applicant in such a case to leave the United Kingdom and it  was  clear
    from the preamble to HC 760 that if an application for entry  clearance
    or leave had been made before 13 December 2012 and the application  had
    not been decided before that date, it would be  decided  in  accordance
    with the  Rules in force on 12 December 2012. HC 820 came into force on
    13 December 2012, and the decision was not made until 21 June 2013.  It
    was therefore an erroneous concession.  There  was  a  question  as  to
    whether there had been a decision by the Tribunal at the time where  it
    said it was going to allow the appeal.  Mr Bramble drew  our  attention
    to the decisions in NR (Jamaica) [2009] EWCA Civ 856 and  Secretary  of
    State v Davoodanah [2004] EWCA Civ 106, which were to the  effect  that
    where a concession has been made it could be  withdrawn  if  there  was
    good reason in all the circumstances to do so and the object was to try
    and obtain a fair and just result.  It would be relevant if there  were
    prejudice to one of the parties  and matters such as the nature of  the
    concession and the timing might also be relevant.

7.   Mr Karim referred to what had been said in his reply  to  Mr  Bramble's
    representations, relying on what had  been  said  by  the  Tribunal  in
    Kishver [2011] UKUT 410 (IAC),  referring  to  Rule  45  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal Procedure Rules and the ability of the Tribunal to review  its
    decision,  and  arguing  that  the  relevant  date  was  the  date   of
    application.  He argued that there would  be  clear  prejudice  to  the
    appellants if the concession was allowed to be withdrawn. The  Tribunal
    had made a decision at the earlier hearing  and  all  that  would  come
    thereafter in the written  document  would  be  the  reasons  for  that
    decision.

8.    Mr  Bramble  had  not  been  obliged  to  make  the  concession.   The
    appellants had been  left thinking that they had won. There was a  need
    for stability in respect  of  their  future.   The  withdrawal  of  the
    concession denied that.  Mr Karim accepted that the concession had been
     wrongly made and it seemed that if the decision were  taken  after  13
    December 2012 then there was the reasonableness element.

9.   After consideration we  stated  that  we  would  allow  Mr  Bramble  to
    withdraw the concession. The first point is the question whether we had
    actually made a decision and were  therefore  functus  officio  at  the
    point when Mr Bramble's withdrawal of the concession was made,  on  the
    day after the hearing.  We do not think that  the  indication  that  we
    gave at the end  of  the  hearing  can  properly  be  regarded  as  the
    Tribunal's decision.  The Tribunal's decision is the document which  is
    promulgated setting out the reasons for the decision  subsequent  to  a
    hearing.  It is regrettable on all sides, and apologies are due and are
    made to the appellants, for the fact that nobody appreciated the timing
    of the impact of HC 820 before Mr Bramble drew it to our  attention  on
    the day after the hearing.  Clearly if we had realised that  there  was
    the additional reasonableness element to be addressed, then the hearing
    would have had to proceed to consider that point and we would have been
    likely to reserve our determination.

10.  As regards the question of whether a concession can  be  withdrawn,  we
    have considered the authorities put before us by Mr Bramble in  NR  and
    Davoodanah.  We note what is said  there  about  the  circumstances  in
    which a concession can be allowed.  The concessions for example  in  NR
    (Jamaica) were first that if the appellant was a lesbian  there  was  a
    real risk on return to Jamaica and the second concession was  that  she
    was a lesbian.  These were concessions of fact, and in  each  case  the
    circumstances could allow a concession to be withdrawn.  So  much  more
    must it be the case where the concession is a matter of law.  It  seems
    to us quite impossible to prevent a concession on a matter of law  from
    being withdrawn since the consequence of not accepting that would be to
    proceed on an entirely false legal basis  in  determining  the  appeal.
    There is a prejudice to the appellants in the sense that  for  a  short
    period of time they believed that they had  been  successful  in  their
    appeal, but the difficulty that arose was identified within 24 hours of
    the hearing and the  fact  that  the  matter  was  to  be  reheard  was
    communicated to the parties by way of directions sent out on 5 December
    2014.

11.  Accordingly, regrettable though it is no doubt  it  is,  in  particular
    from the appellants' point of view, we must assess  the  claim  in  the
    context of HC 820 rather than HC 760, and the issue of whether  or  not
    it would be reasonable to expect any child in this appeal who is  under
    18 and has lived continuously in the United Kingdom for at least  seven
    years to leave the United Kingdom has to form part of our evaluation.

12.  On the substantive issue Mr Karim referred us to paragraphs 26  onwards
    of his skeleton. In LD [2010] UKUT 278 (IAC) it had been said that very
    weighty reasons were needed to justify separating a parent from a minor
    child or a child from a community in which he or she had grown  up  and
    lived for most of his/her life.  More recently, in Azimi-Moayed  [2013]
    UKUT 197 (IAC), among other things it was noted that seven  years  from
    the age of 4 was likely to be more significant  to  a  child  than  the
    first seven years of life.  He argued that the residence of  the  third
    and fourth appellants was in excess of the seven  years  threshold  and
    strong reasons would be needed to justify removing them from the United
    Kingdom where they have lived either all of their  lives  or  the  vast
    majority of their lives. The  eldest  child  had  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom for nearly ten years and the second child who had been born  on
    24 March 2006 would qualify for  registration  next  year.   It  was  a
    question of whether it was reasonable to expect  the  two  children  to
    return.  It was also relevant to take account of  the  amount  of  time
    beyond the seven years minimum as a relevant factor. The  eldest  child
    was doing particularly well at school and it could  be  seen  from  the
    bundle that he had been assessed  as  suitable  for  attending  a  Kent
    grammar school.

13.  As regards the decision in EV [2014] EWCA Civ  874,  relied  on  by  Mr
    Bramble, that was very different on its facts, being  concerned  as  it
    was with a family that had only been in the  United  Kingdom  for  four
    years.  It was a case concerned with the Razgar  guidance  rather  than
    reasonableness within the Rules.

14.  There needed to be a public  interest  in  removing  the  children.  As
    regards the relevance of the parents' behaviour, the Rule did  not  say
    that it would be unreasonable for the family to return, just the child.
     The ordinary meaning of the term "reasonableness" applied. It would be
    necessary to factor in the best interests of the child   as  a  primary
    consideration.  The Rules focussed solely on the child and not on  what
    the parents had  done  and  that  was  sensible  because  parents  made
    decisions for children over  which  they  had  no  choice.   It  was  a
    question  of  whether  for  this  particular  appellant  it  would   be
    reasonable for him to return.

15.  However Mr Karim did not argue that it would be necessary to  disregard
    entirely the actions of the parents. It was a balancing exercise.   The
    appellants' individual circumstances weighed heavily.  It could be seen
    from EV that there was a spectrum of best interests.   It  might  be  a
    question of whether it would be  reasonable  to  expect  the  child  to
    return to Nigeria with the family without having factored into that the
    actions of the parents.

16.  Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act (as amended) was relevant.   Again  the
    emphasis was on the child and that said a lot  about  the  thinking  of
    Parliament.  If it would be unreasonable to expect the child to  return
    it would  be  unreasonable  to  expect  the  parents  to  return.   The
    authorities suggested that there had to  be  very  weighty  reasons  in
    respect of children who were settled in the United Kingdom.

17.  As regards the  parents,  they  would  benefit  from  section  117B(6).
    Subparagraphs (1) to (5) all set out factors  which  were  intended  to
    detract weight from the family and private life.  This  was  a  special
    category.  Reasons had been given why the children could   not  return.
    This is a case where section 117B(6) bit, so the parents could  not  be
    removed.  The issue of the false document could not be a  determinative
    factor. The significant factors were those referring to  the  children.
    If the first four appellants could not be removed then  nor  could  the
    fifth.

18.  In his submissions Mr Bramble relied  on  his  skeleton  argument.   He
    argued that it appeared to be common ground that the  appellants  could
    not succeed under Appendix  FM.   The  Tribunal  was  referred  to  the
    findings of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   The  Tribunal  was  also
    referred to the suitability requirements  concerning  such  matters  as
    false information and representations and failures to disclose as being
    relevant.

19.  There were various components of  paragraph  276ADE.   As  regards  the
    eldest child, it was a question of his age at the date  of  application
    under the Rules and the application had been made on 13 September  2012
    and he had been born on 11 September 2003.  He had been in  the  United
    Kingdom since March 2005 so he was eligible at  the  application  date.
    The second child, who had been born on 24 March 2006, had only been  in
    the United Kingdom for six and a half years at the date of application.
     Only the  eldest  child  therefore  (the  third  appellant)  fell  for
    consideration as having lived in the United Kingdom for seven years  at
    the relevant date.

20.  There was then the question of the suitability  requirements.   On  the
    judge's findings if they were applicable it appeared that the appellant
    would  not  get  to  paragraph  276ADE(i)(iv)  as  the  eldest  child's
    application was impacted  on  by  the  parents'  application.   It  was
    accepted that this was not in the decision but it had  come  out  after
    the judge's findings.

21.  Mr Bramble accepted that the suitability criteria potentially  set  out
    the public interest.  Appendix FM encompassed the public  interest  and
    was part of reasonableness also.  Each case had to be determined on its
    own factors. He accepted that the suitability criteria did not list all
    the factors that were relevant to the public interest. If the  Tribunal
    agreed with his submissions then the eldest child could not succeed and
    nor could the others. It was, as set out at page 10 of the skeleton,  a
    two stage  process. There was a section 55 aspect, and seven years  was
    a benchmark and thereafter it went in favour of the child. It would  be
    necessary to consider  their  circumstances  and  it  seemed  that  the
    educational attainments of the eldest child were in  particular  relied
    on here.   It  was  argued  that  the  decision  in  EV  was  relevant.
    Schooling was not a factor on its own in the child's favour.

22.  It was also necessary  to  consider  the  countervailing  factors,  the
    public interest.  It was  relevant  to  consider  for  example  if  the
    parents had a poor immigration history. A child on its  own  could  not
    just be left in a compartment but it was all part of the balance.

23.  EX1 could only be accessed if the other parts of  the  Rules  had  been
    gone through.  The public interest  factor  had  therefore  been  dealt
    with.  With regard to section 117B(6), it was possible for  the  parent
    to piggy back on the child.  There was  a  reference  to  a  qualifying
    child and that brought in the  paragraph  276ADE  requirements.   Under
    section 117B(6) it seemed it was enough that the child was under 18 and
    had lived in the United Kingdom  for  seven  years  together  with  the
    reasonableness criterion.  It was argued that that criterion looked not
    just  at  the  child  but  at  the  family  unit  also,  including  the
    circumstances of the parents.

24.  With regard to the argument that the issue was that  of  reasonableness
    of return with the family rather than  the  factoring  in  of  parental
    misbehaviour, section 117(B)(6) did not enable a person to  ignore  the
    actions of other parties.  The list set out in section 117B was  not  a
    complete list so it was not possible just to ignore the action  of  the
    parents.  Otherwise this was caught up in the reasonableness element.

25.  We asked Mr Bramble whether he saw a conflict in the terms of  the  IDI
    of November 2014 in which on the one  hand  it  was  said  that  strong
    reasons would be required in order to refuse a case  with continuous UK
    residence of a child of more than 7 years: and elsewhere  that  it  was
    generally the case that it was in a child's best  interests  to  remain
    with their parent(s)  and  unless  special  factors  applied  it  would
    generally be reasonable to expect a child to leave the  United  Kingdom
    with their parents especially if the parent had no right to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom.

26.  Mr Bramble said it was a problem with the  case  law  and  referred  to
    section 55. The family unit was a strong factor. After seven years  the
    balance shifted  in  favour  of  the  child.  He  might  need  to  seek
    clarification on whether there was an inconsistency in the IDI.  Strong
    reasons would be needed to refuse if the child had been in  the  United
    Kingdom for more than seven years.  The family unit  would  not  always
    trump the seven years point.

27.  By way of reply Mr Karim referred to the decision of the Supreme  Court
    in Mahad [2009] UKSC 16 where it was said that  the  Rules  had  to  be
    construed sensibly.  The suitability requirement could not apply to the
    eldest child as there was no onus on him to disclose  that  his  father
    had been working illegally and the reasonableness factor existed in the
    case of such a child but was not applied for example to adults  seeking
    to satisfy the 20+ years test and that was because they would  have  to
    satisfy the suitability element. It was a matter of common sense.  Also
    the focus had to be on the child. The parents would have  had  to  have
    done something wrong.  Section 117B(6) had  been  enacted  because  the
    child's best interests were to be with their parents and the  provision
    was there to defeat the argument that because the  parents  were  going
    the child could  go.  The parent could piggy back on the child. It  was
    unqualified.  It protected a child with seven years' residence from the
    argument that they could be removed because their  parents  were  being
    removed.  It could not be said that it was reasonable to return a child
    because the parents were being returned.  Parliament  had  said  no  to
    that. Reasonableness was a matter  of  balance.   In  addition  it  was
    relevant to note that the appellant had been disadvantaged  because  of
    the timing of the decision on the application which had meant that  the
    reasonableness element came into play whereas it would  not  have  been
    had the decision been  made earlier.

28.  We reserved our determination.

29.  It is common ground that the appellants cannot succeed  under  Appendix
    FM.  The matters at issue are paragraph 276ADE of HC  395  and  section
    117B of the 2002 Act as amended.  Also relevant of course is section 55
    of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

30.  Understandably, in his  skeleton  argument  and  submissions  Mr  Karim
    concentrated on the position of the third and  fourth  appellants.   He
    accepted that the first and second appellants  could  not  come  within
    paragraph 276ADE and nor could the fifth appellant as she had not spent
    at least seven years in the United Kingdom.  His  contention  was  that
    the  third  and  fourth  appellants  could,  and  that  they  satisfied
    paragraph 276ADE(iv).  However, as Mr Bramble argued, although Michael,
    the eldest child, had spent more than seven years in the United Kingdom
    at the relevant time, the same cannot be said for Rachel, the  next  in
    age.  This is because the relevant date is the date of application, and
    whereas Michael, who was born on 11 September 2003 and has been in  the
    United Kingdom since March 2005 can qualify, given  that  the  date  of
    application was 7 September 2012, the same cannot be said of Rachel who
    was born on 24 March 2006.

31.  Mr Karim argued that the focus had to be placed on section 55  and  the
    best interests of the children, noting such relevant decisions as those
    of the Tribunal in LD [2010] UKUT  278 (IAC)  and  Azimi-Moayed  [2013]
    UKUT 197 (IAC).  In LD it was  said  that  very  weighty  reasons  were
    needed to justify separating a parent from a minor  child  or  a  child
    from a community in which he or she had grown up and lived for most  of
    her life, and in Azimi-Moayed it was noted that past and present policy
    had identified seven years as a relevant period in connection with  the
    inappropriateness of disrupting lengthy residence in  a  country  other
    than the state of origin in the absence of compelling  reasons  to  the
    contrary.

32.  With regard to EV (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ 874,  Mr  Karim  argued
    that the appellants there did not come within the seven years provision
    and therefore the situation was factually significantly different.   He
    argued also that the longer a child had  been  in  the  United  Kingdom
    beyond the seven year period, the greater the weight to be attached  to
    the period of time.

33.  We see force to these  points,  although  we  note  what  was  said  at
    paragraph 58 in EV that the question to be answered is  whether  it  is
    "reasonable to expect the child to follow the parent with no  right  to
    remain to the country of origin".

34.  At the heart of this appeal is the question what is meant in  paragraph
    276ADE(iv) by the words "and it would not be reasonable to  expect  the
    applicant to leave the United Kingdom".  This provision is mirrored  in
    the legislation, at section 117B(6) "it would not reasonable to  expect
    to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom". The same  formula  is
    to be found at EX1.  This has relevance both to  the  eldest  child  in
    seeking to fulfil the requirements of 276ADE(iv) and also  his  parents
    with regard to EX1 and section 117B(6).

35.  An initial point we should address  is  that  made  by  Mr  Bramble  in
    submissions that the suitability requirements  are  applicable  to  the
    child appellants.  We do  not accept this  submission  essentially  for
    the reasons given by Mr Karim by way of reply.  The matters set out  at
    section S-LTR are not applicable to the third appellant bearing in mind
    the particular point made by Mr Bramble concerning S-LTR2.2 which  says
    as follows:


         "Whether or not to the applicant's knowledge -


         (a)  false information,  representations  or  documents  have  been
             submitted in  relation  to  the  application,  (inching  false
             information submitted to any person to obtain a document  used
             in support of the application); or


         (b)  there has  been  a  failure  to  disclose  material  facts  in
             relation to the application."

36.  It is not clear what false information,  representations  or  documents
    or failure to disclose material facts is or are relied on, but we  have
    identified none which can be said to be  at  all  attributable  to  the
    third appellant even bearing in mind that these provisions are relevant
    whether or not it was to his knowledge.  The false information, failure
    etc. have to have been in relation to the  application,  and  therefore
    matters such as the false national insurance  number  employed  by  the
    first appellant do not fall within this, and as  we  say,  no  relevant
    matters meeting the criteria set out in S-LTR2.2 have been   identified
    in this case.

37.  We also see force in the point made by Mr Karim concerning the  absence
    of a  reasonableness  requirement  in  respect  of  an  adult  who  has
    satisfied the temporal requirement of twenty years' residence, and who,
    of course, is subject to the suitability requirements, whereas it seems
    to us,  as  Mr  Karim  argues,  less  appropriate  to  argue  that  the
    suitability requirements apply in any event to a child bearing in  mind
    that they have to satisfy the reasonableness  criterion.   That  having
    been said, we agree with Mr Bramble that the matters  set  out  in  the
    suitability requirements do not list all the factors that are  relevant
    to the public interest or indeed to the issue of reasonableness.

38.  In our view the question of what is meant  by  "reasonable"  cannot  be
    equated with a proportionality assessment in respect of  an  Article  8
    claim outside the Rules. For a start the matter  is  to  be  considered
    within the rules, and therefore to that extent what  was  said  by  the
    Court of Appeal in EV (Philippines) is not strictly on point,  although
    clearly not without relevance.  But we do not think that reasonableness
    necessarily entails the question of whether it is reasonable to  expect
    the child to follow the parent with no right to remain to  the  country
    of origin.  The wording of section 117B(6) makes it  clear  that  where
    the person is not liable to deportation the public  interest  does  not
    require their removal where they have a genuine and subsisting parental
    relationship with a qualifying child and it would not be reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.  This must apply  whether
    the  matter  falls  within  or  outside  the  Immigration   Rules.    A
    significant element of the proportionality balance that would otherwise
    exist in an Article 8 case outside the rules case is taken away.

39.  That does not mean, however, that the matter is entirely one-sided.  Mr
    Karim, very properly, accepted that, the situation and conduct  of  the
    children's parents were relevant, and in particular the conduct of  the
    first appellants' father who was castigated by the judge,  for  example
    at paragraph 15 of his determination  in  these  terms  "his  behaviour
    whilst in the United Kingdom has been devious, dishonest and  knowingly
    unlawful".  But clearly weight must be attached, bearing  in  mind  the
    need to take into account his best interests, to the situation  of  the
    third appellant  and  the  impact  on  him,  taking  into  account  his
    promising performance at school and the amount of time that he has been
    in the United Kingdom.  It is not in our view appropriate  to  set  out
    relevant  factors  that  might  be  appropriate  to  an  assessment  of
    reasonableness as this will be very case  specific,  except  to  remind
    ourselves of the point made above that it  is  not  just  a  matter  of
    looking at the matter from the child's point of view but there must  be
    an element of objectivity about this.  Equally we do  not consider that
    it is as simple as Mr Bramble suggests it is, to follow what  was  said
    in EV (Philippines) and define the question  as  being  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect the child to follow the parent with  no  right  to
    remain to the country of origin.  We think that the  term  "reasonable"
    must be interpreted in a commonsense manner  and  attaching  particular
    weight to the child's interests but bearing in mind  also  the  conduct
    and status of other family members and other matters  relevant  to  the
    claim in the balance that is the proper approach.

40.  In light of what we consider the proper approach is, we apply  this  to
    the  facts  of  this  case.   We  bear  in  mind  the  judge's  remarks
    summarising the conduct of the first appellant and the fact that he and
    the other family members cannot succeed under  the  Immigration  Rules,
    against the particular situation of the third appellant, including  his
    promising performance at school and the amount of time he has  been  in
    the United Kingdom, and bearing in mind also what was said in decisions
    such as Azimi-Moayed about the interests of children albeit  that  that
    was not in the context of section 117B(6).

41.  In our view it would not be reasonable to expect  the  third  appellant
    to leave the United Kingdom.  As  a  consequence  this  means  that  he
    succeeds under paragraph 276ADE(1)(4), and bearing in mind the terms of
    the subsection therefore the  public  interest  does  not  require  the
    removal of his parents, both of whom have indisputably  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with him.  In the circumstances  where
    their parents and elder brother have succeeded  in  their  appeals,  it
    seems to us to follow axiomatically that the appeals of the fourth  and
    fifth appellants must also be allowed under Article 8.

42.  These appeals are therefore all allowed.
