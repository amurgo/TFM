For the Respondent:     Ms J Rothwell, counsel, instructed by Birnberg
Peirce & Partners

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

[1]  This is the Secretary of State's appeal against a determination of  the
    First-tier Tribunal which allowed the appeal  of  Colin  Ricardo  Allen
    against a decision of the Secretary of State dated 15 February 2013  to
    deport him from the United Kingdom.

[2]  At the outset of the hearing of the appeal, given  that  we  found  the
    grant of permission to appeal  to  be  formulated  in  somewhat  opaque
    terms, we requested Mr Hopkin on behalf of the Secretary  of  State  to
    articulate the error of law which is advanced on his  client's  behalf.
    This elicited the response that the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is contaminated by inadequate  reasoning.  Having  taken  into
    account the submission on behalf  of  Mr  Allen  by  Mrs  Rothwell  (of
    counsel) we ruled that the grant of permission to appeal is couched  in
    sufficiently  broad  terms  to  embrace  this  discrete  legal  defect.
    Accordingly we determine this appeal on the basis that the enquiry  for
    this Tribunal is whether the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    adequately reasoned.

[3]  The focus of the argument of Mr Hopkin on behalf of  the  Secretary  of
    State was that the particulars of  the  asserted  inadequate  reasoning
    consist of a failure to take into account  the  sentencing  transcript.
    We turn to  the  transcript  at  this  juncture.   The  Respondent  was
    convicted at Northampton Crown Court.  He was  sentenced  on  22  March
    2010.  He was convicted of the offences of supplying controlled  drugs,
    being class A drugs, for which he received a commensurate  sentence  of
    four years and nine months' imprisonment.  There were three  counts  in
    total.  The circumstances  are  rehearsed  in  the  transcript  of  the
    sentencing. We draw attention to the following statements on  the  part
    of the sentencing judge:

         "What you supplied to those two men on those two days was  a  total
         of four 20 pound wraps, in round figures worth �70 or perhaps  �80,
         so an example of low level drug dealing, but with a  very  specific
         method of operating, that is to say using car parks of places which
         were open to the public at times when you thought you  would  merge
         into the surroundings."


     He then adverted to the surveillance  operation  by  the  police  which
    uncovered the offending.   He  acknowledged  that  the  Respondent  was
    acquitted in respect of a number of  counts  but  opined  that  he  had
    probably been engaged in this criminal  activity  during  a  relatively
    lengthy period.  We interpose here the observation that, of course, the
    Respondent was convicted only in respect of these particular offences.

[4]  The sentencing judge saw fit to repeat his assessment  of  the  gravity
    and scale of the appellant's offending when he said:

         "So to repeat, you were a low-level drug dealer but nonetheless  an
         essential cog in a much larger machine."


     He then elaborated in the following words:

         "It is fairly obvious that you were not making much  money  out  of
         this and were supplementing  your  income,  honestly  earned  as  a
         skilled carpenter and handyman, of whom many customers  and  indeed
         your family spoke very highly and it is a further tribute  to  your
         previous good character which you  have  now  lost,  that  you  did
         eventually comply with your bail conditions."


     The judge then continued:

         "I shall put your sentence towards the lower end of the scale which
         might otherwise have achieved in the circumstances as  I  have  set
         them out."


     He described the Respondent as a devoted family man,  someone  from  an
    extended family who thinks highly of him.  On the  other  side  of  the
    scales, he continued:

         "What you did was to make a contribution in your way,  as  a  minor
         dealer, to the perpetuation  of  those  who  were  perhaps  already
         corrupted.  Accordingly, of course with some  regret,  because  you
         are otherwise a good man, it is necessary to pass  concurrently  on
         each count a substantial sentence of  imprisonment  reflecting  all
         the  features  outlined  and  all  the   matters   highlighted   in
         mitigation."


     The judge then gave consideration to the  pre-sentence  report  and  he
    continued by determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed.

[5]  At the conclusion of the hearing the judge said the following:

         "The clerk is checking with me  about  the  deportation.  There  is
        nothing the court has to say about that  except,  of  course,  even
        though  Mr  Allen  has  just  left,  that  one  would   see   every
        justification  for  deportation  for  anybody  convicted  of  these
        offences. But that is not controversial."

    Given the context, it seems to us that, here, the judge was  reflecting
    on whether he was obliged by legislation to make any order  in  respect
    of deportation, whether a binding order or recommendation. We take into
    account that the legislation on this subject has changed during  recent
    years. Continuing, the judge said, in terms,  that  the  court  had  no
    function in this respect. He then added an opinion which, he  recorded,
    was expressed in the absence of the Respondent [who had evidently  been
    escorted  from  the  courtroom]  that  "........one  would  see   every
    justification for deportation for anybody convicted of these offences".




[6]   We  consider   the   contention   that   the   First-tier   Tribunal's
    determination was inadequately reasoned in the following way.  First of
    all, it is accepted,  correctly,  that  the  Tribunal  directed  itself
    correctly in law and gave consideration to all relevant  jurisprudence.
    This, on any showing, is  a  positive  starting  point  for  any  first
    instance Tribunal. The Tribunal recorded  at  some  length,  albeit  in
    summary form, the evidence presented on behalf of the Respondent and in
    this respect we refer to  paragraphs  26  to  41.   The  Tribunal  then
    addressed its mind to findings of credibility and fact.  It  introduced
    this section of its judgment with the following statement at  paragraph
    54:

         "After consideration of this case and the  evidence,  we  concluded
         that this was anything but a normal Jamaican drug dealer's case."


      This  is  the  first  clear  signpost  in  the  determination  to  the
    Tribunal's assessment that this was a wholly exceptional case.

[7]   Next   the   Tribunal   referred   to   the   child   and   adolescent
    psychotherapist's report.  Some further evidence bearing  on  the  main
    issue which preoccupied the Tribunal, namely the  relationship  between
    the Respondent and one of the children of the family and the  predicted
    severe impact on the said child arising out of the deportation  of  his
    father, the Respondent, was then considered.  Adopting  the  assessment
    in the psychotherapist's report, the Tribunal found [at  paragraph  57]
    that  the  removal  of  the  Respondent  from  the  household  and  his
    deportation to Jamaica would have a significant adverse effect  on  the
    development of the child in question and  the  Tribunal  elaborated  in
    very clear and cogent terms on that assessment.  It continued:

         "We  consider  that  this  by  itself  would  be   an   exceptional
         circumstance when we consider all the other factors  including  the
         length of time the Appellant has been in the  United  Kingdom,  the
         low risk of offending and his  family  relationships,  we  consider
         that the whole appeal must fall within the exceptional category".


     Here we  have  the  Tribunal's  ominous  conclusion  expressed  in  the
    context of making findings of credibility and fact and this is followed
    by a further consideration of the evidence and further findings  -  for
    example, a more detailed finding [at paragraph 59] concerning  the  low
    risk of future re-offending and a correct assessment of the  scale  and
    gravity of the Respondent's offending.

[8]  The sentence to which we have just referred [at the  end  of  paragraph
    59] is a rather important one in the context of this appeal because  it
    confounds the contention on behalf of the Secretary of State  that  the
    Tribunal failed to give consideration to the contents of the sentencing
    transcript.  This is the clearest possible indication that the Tribunal
    had the sentencing  transcript  to  the  forefront  of  its  mind  when
    pronouncing its determination.

[9]  In a series of other passages which follow  the  Tribunal  adverted  to
    the  public  interest  and,  in  terms,  to  the   relevant   statutory
    superstructure. These passages must be  considered  cumulatively:  they
    are found particularly in paragraphs 60, 68 and, in tandem,  paragraphs
    75 through to 81 to which we refer but which we need not rehearse.

[10] The duty imposed on the Tribunal  to  provide  an  adequately  reasoned
    judgment is one of longstanding.  While it is rehearsed  in  Procedural
    Rules it is, properly analysed, a  duty  of  common  law  pedigree  and
    character. Indeed the  rehearsal  of  this  duty  in  Procedural  Rules
    sometimes gives rise to the misconception of a purely procedural  duty.
    It is something altogether more profound than that.  It  has  been  the
    subject  of  authoritative  judicial  consideration  in  a  series   of
    decisions. For example, Lane LCJ said in  the  case  of  ex-parte  Khan
    [1983] QB 790 at page 794:

         "It must be apparent from what Tribunals state by  way  of  reasons
         first of all that they have considered the point which is at  issue
         between the parties and they should indicate the evidence on  which
         they had come to their conclusions".


     Comparable pronouncements are found in a  series  of  other  decisions.
    We confine ourselves referring to the comprehensive exposition of  this
    duty formulated by the Court of Appeal in  Flannery  v  Halifax  Estate
    Agencies [2000] 1All ER 373, in the judgment of Henry LJ at page 377. I
    quote from the first of the four propositions which are set out:

         "The requirement of reasons is  a  function  of  due  process  and,
         therefore, of justice.  Its rationale has  two  principal  aspects.
         The first is  that  fairness  surely  requires  that  the  parties,
         especially the losing party, should be left in no  doubt  why  they
         have won or lost.  The second is the requirement  to  give  reasons
         concentrates the mind if it is fulfilled.  The  resulting  decision
         is much more likely to be soundly based on the evidence than it  is
         not."

[11] The function of this  Tribunal  in  an  error  of  law  appeal,  having
    identified at the outset the precise nature of the error  canvassed  by
    the Secretary of State, is to consider the Determination of the  First-
    tier Tribunal as a whole and in the full context of all of the evidence
    which was before it including, inter alia, the  sentencing  transcript.
    We are in no doubt that the Determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    accords with the principles to which we have  just  referred.   In  our
    judgment this determination conveyed clearly too both parties  why  one
    succeeded and the other failed.  The Tribunal, having  directed  itself
    correctly to the requirement that the case must be an exceptional  one,
    balanced against the potent public interest in deportation as a general
    rule, conducted a balancing exercise and found the case to be a  wholly
    exceptional one, giving determinate weight to  the  factors  which  are
    clearly  articulated  from  paragraphs  57   and   following   of   the
    determination.  It is appropriate to highlight that the jurisdiction of
    this Tribunal is dictated by the consideration that it  is  constrained
    to conduct an exercise circumscribed  by  the  asserted  error  of  law
    committed by the First-tier Tribunal.  This is not  an  appeal  on  the
    merits.  Furthermore, it is not for this Tribunal to ask itself whether
    it would or would not have  reached  the  same  decision.  Rather,  the
    function of this Tribunal is to apply the appropriate  legal  standards
    and principles to the decision under challenge.

[12] We conclude that this determination withstands the  specific  challenge
    which has been mounted by the Secretary of State.  Thus the appeal must
    be dismissed.  This constitutes  a  ruling  which  has  some  immediate
    consequences for the Respondent,  Mr  Allen,  but  does  not  have  the
    standing or effect of any long-term resolution of his presence  in  the
    United Kingdom.  That will be a matter for further and  other  decision
    making processes which lie outwith the boundaries of the appeal to this
    Tribunal.
