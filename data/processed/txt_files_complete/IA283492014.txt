Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Tampuri, Legal Representative, Tamson Legal
Services


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant  as  the  secretary  of  state  and  the
    respondent as "the claimant."

 2. The claimant is a national of Ghana, born  on  11  February  1983.  His
    appeal  against  the  secretary  of  state's  decision  to  refuse  his
    application for a residence card under Regulation 17 of the Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") as the husband  of  his
    sponsor, Mrs Amankwaah, a national of Italy,  and  accordingly  an  EEA
    national,  was  allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Coutts  in  a
    determination promulgated on 13 April 2015. She found that the claimant
    and his sponsor were in a durable  relationship  for  the  purposes  of
    Regulation 8(5) of the 2006 Regulations.  That  finding  has  not  been
    challenged by the secretary of state.

 3. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Colyer on 10 June 2015 on  the  ground  that  the  Judge
    arguably erred in allowing the appeal outright and should have remitted
    the case to the secretary of state for her to exercise discretion under
    Regulation 17(4) of the 2006 Regulations.

 4. Ms Holmes relied on the Upper  Tribunal  decision  in  Ihemedu  (OFM  -
    Meaning) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 340 (IAC).

 5. At the hearing before me, Mr Tampuri accepted that there  had  been  an
    error of law to the extent referred to.

 6. Regulation 17(4) of the 2006 Regulations provides a discretion  to  the
    secretary of state to issue a residence card  to  an  "extended  family
    member". It is evident that in this case the secretary of state has not
    yet considered the exercise of such discretion. It is not open  to  the
    Tribunal to consider the exercise of discretion in the absence  of  the
    secretary of state first doing so.

 7. In the circumstances I allow the appeal of the secretary  of  state  to
    the limited extent referred to.  The case will thus be remitted to  the
    secretary of state for her  to  exercise  discretion  under  Regulation
    17(4) of the 2006 Regulations

    Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and the decision is set aside. The decision I substitute  is  to
    allow the claimant's appeal to the extent that his application  for  an
    EEA residence card remains outstanding before the secretary of state.

    No anonymity direction is made.
