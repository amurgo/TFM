                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellant is a Kosovan national born on 31  October  1992.  He  appeals,
with permission, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  dismissing
his appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse to issue him  with  a
residence card under the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
2016 as the family member (spouse) of an EEA national.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Wylie dismissed his appeal.

The background to this appeal is as follows. The appellant  entered  the  UK
on 19 April 2014 with a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  visa  valid  until
29 July 2015. He was  granted  further  leave  in  that  capacity  until  14
November 2017. His leave to remain was subsequently curtailed to  expire  on
28  May  2016  when  his  sponsor  ceased  sponsoring   him   due   to   his
unsatisfactory  academic  progress  and  attendance.  On  18  May  2017  the
appellant applied for  a  residence  card  as  the  extended  family  member
(durable partner) of an EEA national, Andrea [P], a  Spanish  national.  The
application was refused on 7 September 2017 as the appellant provided no  ID
and the relationship was not durable as  they  had  only  met  three  months
prior to lodging the application.

The appellant then made an application to marry Andrea [P]. On 20  September
2017 the couple were interviewed separately. As a  result  of  the  numerous
discrepancies arising in the evidence and the misleading replies of  Andrea,
she was asked if there was anything she  wanted  to  clarify  before  checks
were carried out and she admitted that she was employed by  the  appellant's
brother-in-law who had approached her with a proposed arrangement  to  marry
the appellant to enable him to  remain  in  the  UK  and  had  been  offered
�10,000. She was paid �1,000 as an initial payment which was  used  for  her
mother to do an English course and she was told that she would  receive  the
outstanding �9,000 once they were  married.  The  appellant  also  gave  her
�1,000 to put in a joint account for living  arrangements.  Andrea  admitted
that the arrangement was to  deceive  the  Home  Office  and  to  unlawfully
assist the appellant to obtain leave to remain in the UK.  She  also  stated
that the appellant had been working cash in hand.

The appellant and Andrea [P] were served with non-compliance  letters  as  a
result of having failed to produce tenancy  agreements  and  full  6  months
bank statements and  Andrea  was  served  with  a  first  stage  deportation
letter. Despite that, the appellant married Andrea on 20 November 2017.

On 25 November 2017 the appellant  applied  for  a  residence  card  as  the
spouse of an EEA national. In  the  covering  letter  for  that  application
(which is dated 16 May 2017 - clearly in error),  it  was  stated  that  the
couple met at a night-club in February 2017 and in  April  2017  decided  to
get married. They had been living together since July 2017 and were  married
on 20 November 2017. The application was refused on 9 February 2018  on  the
basis that the appellant had entered into a marriage of convenience for  the
sole purpose of him remaining in the UK.

The appellant appealed against that decision. In the grounds of  appeal,  it
was stated that the appellant and his partner had  started  living  together
as husband and wife in  July  2017  and  were  still  living  together.  The
relationship was durable and the marriage was genuine.

The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Wylie on 7 September  2018.
The judge had before her a bundle of documents for the  appellant,  as  well
as the respondent's appeal bundle. The appellant's  appeal  bundle  included
statements from the appellant, from Andrea [P] and her mother and a  friend,
from  the  appellant's  sister  and  from  the  appellant's  brother-in-law,
landlord  and  neighbour;  proof  of  Andrea's  pregnancy,  records  of  the
marriage interviews and photographs.

In his statement the appellant said that he and Andrea had met  at  work  in
May 2014 and started a relationship a few months afterwards. In  April  2017
they decided to get married and started living together  in  June  2017.  He
moved in with Andrea and her mother. In regard to  the  marriage  interview,
the appellant stated that it was a  long  interview  which  took  almost  an
entire day and that he and Andrea had been confused about  what  to  say  in
particular because he was working cash in  hand  when  they  met.  They  had
therefore tried to hide the fact that they met  at  work  and  that  he  was
working and it was for that reason that they gave  different  answers  about
how they met. The appellant explained that the payment of �10,000 was  money
which he had saved and which he had told Andrea when they decided  to  marry
that he would use to help with  the  household  expenses  and  to  help  her
mother.

In her statement, Andrea [P] stated that she met the appellant  at  work  in
April 2016. She stated that they decided to get married in  April  2017  and
the appellant moved in with her and her mother in June  2017.  The  marriage
interview contained mistakes. She was not provided with an  interpreter  and
did  not  understand  a  lot  of  the  questions.  The  immigration  officer
frightened her and threatened her that she would have  a  problem  with  the
police if her relationship was found not to be genuine. She was  treated  as
a criminal and illegal  and  she  became  stressed  and  scared  to  respond
properly. She was not given a chance to read through  the  interview  record
before signing it. They did not want to admit that they met at work  as  her
husband was working without permission and so they gave a different  account
of where they had met. The immigration officer  had  believed  her  to  have
given misleading information because she had said that her mobile  telephone
was stolen in Spain and  yet  she  had  a  mobile  with  her,  but  she  had
mentioned her mobile being  stolen  because  it  was  that  telephone  which
contained all her photographs, conversations and messages and the  telephone
she had with her was just a simple phone obtained when she  came  back  from
Spain. It was not correct that she worked for  the  appellant's  brother-in-
law, but he was a work colleague who had simply come to talk  to  her  about
her intentions towards the appellant. The payment of �10,000 was  money  the
appellant said that he had saved up and which they  could  use  to  pay  any
expenses for  the  marriage  and  for  the  house.  There  was  no  arranged
marriage. Andrea stated further that she was pregnant with  the  appellant's
baby and their relationship was genuine.

At the hearing, the judge heard oral evidence  from  the  appellant,  Andrea
[P] and Andrea's mother. The judge did not consider that, at  the  time  the
marriage was entered into, the intention was to have a genuine marriage  and
she  concluded  that  the  marriage  was  one  of  convenience.  The   judge
accordingly found that the appellant was not entitled to  a  residence  card
as the spouse of an EEA national and dismissed the appeal.

The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  that  decision  to  the  Upper
Tribunal on the grounds that  the  judge  had  erred  in  the  way  she  had
approached the consideration of the parties' intentions at the date  of  the
marriage and had failed to consider the change in intentions since the  time
of the "sham" agreement; or, in the alternative,  the  judge  had  erred  by
failing to consider that the relationship was genuine at  the  time  of  the
hearing.

Permission was refused in the First-tier Tribunal and  the  Upper  Tribunal.
However, in a "Cart" challenge to the Administrative  Court,  the  appellant
sought to judicially review the refusal to grant permission on  the  grounds
and permission was granted by Sr Ross  Cranston  sitting  as  a  High  Court
judge on the following basis:

    "The factual position is somewhat confusing and it may be that this  is
    where things went wrong. In essence, as I understand it,  although  the
    wife said in her 20 September 2017 interview  that  the  marriage  when
    arranged the previous February was intended to be one  of  convenience,
    she went on to say that by then  (i.e.  the  September  interview)  the
    situation had changed. Indeed (a) the  parties  went  on  to  marry  in
    November 2017 even though they knew the Secretary of State regarded the
    marriage as a sham; and (b) by the time of the  hearing  the  following
    September 2018, she was pregnant and the  hospital  named  him  as  the
    father. With that background it seems to me that both grounds are  made
    out sufficiently to grant permission."

In the absence of any request for a substantive hearing following the  grant
of permission the Administrative Court quashed the  decision  of  the  Upper
Tribunal refusing permission and  permission  was  subsequently  granted  by
Vice-President Ockelton in the Upper Tribunal  on  29  May  2019.  Thus  the
matter came before me.

The parties made submissions.

Mr Leskin submitted that it was accepted that the judge was  right  to  find
that there  was  originally  an  agreement  to  enter  into  a  marriage  of
convenience. However that was not sufficient to conclude that  the  marriage
was one of convenience at the time it was entered into. The  relevant  issue
was the intention of the parties at the time  of  the  marriage.  The  judge
accepted at [33] that that was the relevant issue, but  that  was  not  what
she then went on to do, as she continued to look at the  intentions  at  the
time of the  agreement  and  failed  to  consider  the  evidence  after  the
interview.  The  sponsor  admitted  having  lied  about  when  she  and  the
appellant had met and about the agreement to  receive  money  but  said  the
rest  was  true.  By  the  time  of  the  interview  there  was  a   genuine
relationship and even more so by the time of the marriage. Mr Leskin  relied
on the case of Sadovska & Anor v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
(Scotland) (Rev 1) [2017] UKSC 54 in submitting that  the  burden  of  proof
was upon the Secretary of State to show that at the time  the  marriage  was
entered into, it was a marriage of convenience. The judge had erred in  that
respect and by failing to look at the facts at the date of the marriage  and
the developments since the arrangement was made. The judge also relied  upon
the fact that the sponsor had  not  met  the  appellant's  sister,  yet  she
clearly had met her by the time of the marriage. Mr Leskin  submitted  that,
in the alternative, the judge ought to have considered whether the  marriage
had become genuine by the time of the hearing, which was a matter left  open
in Rosa v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ  14  at
[41].

Ms Fijiwala submitted  that  it  was  never  argued  before  the  First-tier
Tribunal that this was an agreement to enter into a sham marriage which  had
later changed into a genuine marriage. The  judge  could  not  therefore  be
said to have erred in law by failing to consider a matter not raised  before
her. The judge had looked at the evidence  as  a  whole  and  not  just  the
evidence  at  the  interview.  The  reference  to  a   subsequent   conjugal
relationship was after the marriage, but at the date  of  the  marriage  the
judge considered the evidence to show that the intentions were not  genuine.
That was the relevant point in time to  be  considered  and  not  after  the
marriage. Ms Fijiwala relied upon the case of  Molina  v  SSHD  [2017]  EWHC
1730 in that regard, at [59] and [60] in submitting that the relevant  issue
was whether the marriage was entered into for the  purposes  of  gaining  an
immigration advantage.



Discussion

The grant of permission in the Administrative Court was made  on  the  basis
that  there  had  been  a  misunderstanding  and  confusion  about  the  EEA
national's admission at her interview and that whilst she had  admitted,  at
the interview of 20 September 2017,  to  have  previously  entered  into  an
agreement for an arrangement for a marriage, her evidence at  the  interview
was that the situation had changed by then. However  it  seems  to  me  that
that itself is a misunderstanding. It was a misunderstanding which no  doubt
arose from the grounds seeking permission which were made on such  a  basis,
namely that the appellant's case was that, having admitted  and  come  clean
about the initial arrangement, the situation had changed since then and  the
relationship has since become a genuine one and the intentions had changed.

However, as Ms Fijiwala submitted, that was not the way that  the  case  was
presented to the judge. The case was presented to the  judge  on  the  basis
that there had never been any arrangement for a sham marriage and  that  the
respondent had misunderstood the evidence of the appellant and  the  sponsor
at their interviews, in particular the sponsor's response to question 35  of
her interview. That is clear from  the  sponsor's  appeal  statement  of  29
August 2018 in which she denied that there had ever been any such  agreement
or arrangement and was attempting to backtrack from the evidence  suggesting
as much. That was the basis upon which the judge approached the case  before
her and she cannot be said  to  have  erred  in  law  by  so  doing.  Having
rejected the appellant's and sponsor's  denial  of  entering  into  such  an
agreement for the reasons properly given, the judge was  perfectly  entitled
to approach the evidence of the development of the relationship  since  that
time with some caution. The judge was, of course, fully aware that  she  had
to consider the parties' intentions at the time of the marriage rather  than
at the time of the arrangement or the interview, but was fully  entitled  to
take  into  account,  in  undertaking  that  exercise,  the  fact  that  the
appellant and sponsor were lying about not having  previously  entered  into
any arrangement.

Mr Leskin placed reliance upon the sponsor's answer to question  43  of  her
interview, that she had not lied  about  her  account  of  the  relationship
other than in regard to how it commenced and how she and the  appellant  had
met, in submitting that the judge had erred by failing to  consider  and  to
give weight to the evidence of the couple living together since  July  2017,
sleeping together and having a loving and sexual  relationship,  leading  to
the pregnancy and to the marriage. However, and on the contrary,  the  judge
clearly did consider all the relevant evidence and  she  provided  full  and
cogent reasons  for  concluding  that  the  evidence  as  a  whole  did  not
demonstrate a genuine relationship at the time of the marriage. At [32]  she
considered the genuineness of the relationship leading up  to  the  marriage
to be undermined by the fact that the appellant had not even introduced  his
sister to the sponsor prior to the wedding, a  matter  from  which  she  was
fully entitled to draw the adverse conclusions that she  did.  At  [33]  the
judge expressly confirmed that she had looked  at  the  evidence  since  the
marriage to cast light on the parties' intentions at the relevant  time  and
she then went on to analyse that evidence in the  subsequent  paragraphs  to
[41]. I do  not  agree  with  Mr  Leskin  that  the  judge  was  basing  her
conclusion solely on the previous arrangement, but  it  is  clear  that  she
undertook a full assessment of the relationship subsequent to that time  and
at the time of the marriage itself, clearly referring  to  evidence  at  the
time of, and subsequent to the marriage, at [36] to [41].  Whilst the  judge
did not specifically refer to the evidence of the couple  sleeping  together
and having an intimate relationship, it is clear  that  she  considered  all
the evidence in the  round  and  rejected  it  for  the  reasons  fully  and
properly given. In any event, and whilst not raised  by  the  judge,  it  is
relevant to note that  the  evidence  as  to  the  intimate  nature  of  the
relationship was not consistent, with the appellant's evidence at  questions
68, 76 and 89 suggesting  a  full  sexual  relationship  but  the  sponsor's
evidence at 15 and 21 suggesting otherwise.

Mr Leskin  relies  on  the  judge's  reference  at  [41]  to  the  sponsor's
pregnancy and at [42] to a  conjugal  life  possibly  having  been  embraced
subsequently. The evidence as to the  appellant  being  the  father  of  the
unborn child was limited to a single reference in a hospital  form  at  page
31 of the appeal bundle and the judge clearly had regard to  that  evidence.
However she properly found that that was not sufficient to show  that  there
was a genuine relationship at the time of the marriage and, in light of  the
otherwise limited evidence and  the  appellant's  and  sponsor's  unreliable
evidence, the judge was perfectly  entitled  to  accord  that  one  document
limited weight, in particular in regard to the situation at the time of  the
marriage. Mr Leskin submitted, as an alternative argument,  that  the  judge
ought to have considered the situation  at  the  time  of  the  hearing  and
therefore found in favour  of  the  relationship  given  her  finding  of  a
conjugal life, but it seems to me that not only does the case law  refer  to
the relevant time being  the  date  the  marriage  was  entered  into  (Rosa
paragraph 41), but also the judge made no firm finding in  that  regard  and
was simply leaving the way open for a future application. Clearly  that  was
the correct approach and, if it is the case that the appellant  and  sponsor
enjoy a genuine relationship and a family life with their  child,  that  may
form the basis of a fresh application rather than a  basis  upon  which  the
appeal before the First-tier Tribunal ought to have been allowed.

Accordingly it seems to me that the judge was fully  and  properly  entitled
to make the adverse findings and reach the adverse conclusion that  she  did
on the evidence before her and for the reasons  fully  and  properly  given.
The  judge's  approach  to  the  evidence,  and  to  the  question  of   the
appellant's intentions in regard to his marriage,  was  in  accordance  with
the relevant caselaw and the correct test and principles. She was fully  and
properly entitled  to  conclude  that  the  appellant  had  entered  into  a
marriage of convenience, for the sole and also the  predominant  purpose  of
gaining an immigration advantage, and that he was not,  therefore,  entitled
to a residence card as the family member of an EEA national.  There were  no
errors of law in her decision.



DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve  an
error on a point of law. I do not set aside the decision.  The  decision  to
dismiss the appeal stands.
