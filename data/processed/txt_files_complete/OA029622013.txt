Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Claimants: Mr Chahal as McKenzie Friend


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


The claimants are citizens of Afghanistan and were born on 21 May  2003  and
22 September 2010 respectively.

For the purposes of this decision I refer to the Entry Clearance Officer  as
the respondent, his position before the First-tier Tribunal.

This is the respondent's appeal against the determination promulgated  on  9
June 2014 of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Flower  which  allowed  the  entry
clearance appeals under Article 8  ECHR  brought  against  the  respondent's
decisions of 20 December 2012 to refuse entry clearance.

The background to this appeal is  that  the  two  appellants  are  siblings.
Their father was killed in Afghanistan on 20 January 2010 when their  mother
was pregnant with the second appellant. The family then moved to Pakistan.

On 28 June  2010,  following  family  discussions,  the  appellants'  mother
married her husband's brother, the  appellants'  paternal  uncle.    He  has
been recognised by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  as  a
refugee. His first wife and children were all killed in an  air  bombardment
in Afghanistan.

The mother of the appellants then made an application  for  entry  clearance
for the first appellant and two other siblings from her first marriage.  The
application was refused but successfully appealed on 1 February 2012.  Entry
clearance was granted to the appellants' mother and two other  siblings  but
not the first appellant. This was because the legal representative  at  that
time had failed to include him in the appeal.

After the appellants' mother and two siblings were granted entry  clearance,
a further application was made for the appellants on 2  June  2012  and  the
refusal on 20 December 2012 has led to the appeal before me.

The grounds argue that as the Immigration Rules are a  complete  code,  they
must be the starting point in any Article  8  consideration.  The  judge  is
stated not to have considered the Immigration Rules and the public  interest
correctly. That cannot be right. Judge Flowers  considered  the  Immigration
Rules at [7], [13], [14] and [27] to  [32],  finding  that  the  maintenance
requirement was not met. The judge set out the correct test for  the  public
interest at [33], referred to the Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 questions  at  [34],
and at [35] found the respondent's decision to be  in  accordance  with  the
law as the Immigration Rules were not met.

Further, at [37], the First-tier Tribunal judge  stated  in  terms  that  he
recognised the public interest in the maintenance  of  immigration  control.
He stated  in  terms  at  [37]  that  the  failure  to  meet  the  financial
requirements was a matter of significance in that context.

As a result, I was satisfied that  in  the  proportionality  assessment  the
First-tier Tribunal judge took the correct approach to  the  general  weight
to  be  afforded  to  public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of   effective
immigration control and to the specific detriment  to  the  public  interest
here, that a burden on state funds arose where the  maintenance  requirement
had not been met. No error arises from the judge's approach  to  the  public
interest, therefore.

The grounds go on to maintain that a test  of  compelling  or  unduly  harsh
circumstances or exceptionality applied in any Article 8  consideration  but
that such circumstances were not identified here. Firstly,  as  conceded  by
Mr Mills for the respondent, as the applications were made prior to  9  July
2012 that ground loses its force following the  ratio  of  Edgehill  v  SSHD
[2014] EWCA Civ 402. The approach to Article 8 brought about by the  changes
to the Immigration  Rules  on  9  July  2012  has  no  purchase  where  this
application was made prior to that date.

In any event, it appeared  to  me  that  Judge  Flower  provided  sufficient
reasons in the  determination  and  at  [38]  and  [39]  in  particular  for
allowing the Article 8 appeal regardless of the  legal  matrix  applied.  At
the date  of  the  decision  the  mother  and  two  other  siblings  of  the
appellants  had  been  granted  entry  clearance.  The  situation   of   the
appellants was that they were to live on their own in  Pakistan,  not  their
country of origin, cared for by neighbours. The second  appellant  was  2  ï¿½
years old at that time and the first appellant under 10 years old. The  very
tragic family background set  out  above  was  not  disputed.  Judge  Flower
referred to it as "devastating" at  [39].  Even  on  the  post-9/7/12  legal
matrix of there needing to be "exceptional", "compelling" or "unduly  harsh"
circumstances, it appeared to me that Judge Flower found  that  there  were,
after, as above, having taken the correct approach to  the  public  interest
and was entitled to do so.

Paragraph 6 of the grounds is only a disagreement with the  finding  of  the
First-tier Tribunal  that the accommodation requirement of  the  Immigration
Rules was met, a finding clearly open to the judge on the evidence,  and  Mr
Mills sensibly took that point no further before me.

For all of these reasons, I did not find that  the  grounds  of  appeal  had
merit.

DECISION

  12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an error  on
      a point of law and shall stand.
