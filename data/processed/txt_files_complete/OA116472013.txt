Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Diwnycz, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Not present and not represented


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent, Regina Il Perez Villar, was born on 9 December 1980 and
    is a female citizen of the Philippines.  She sought entry clearance  to
    the United Kingdom to  join  her  husband,  Jefferson  King  (hereafter
    referred to as the sponsor).  Her application was refused by the ECO in
    Manila on 25 April 2013.   She  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Cox) which, in a determination  promulgated  on  22  April  2014
    allowed the appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  (Article  8  ECHR)  but
    dismissed it under the Immigration Rules.  The Entry Clearance  Officer
    now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The sponsor did not attend the Upper Tribunal hearing at Bradford on 10
    October 2014 and nor was the respondent represented.  I  had  a  letter
    from the respondent's solicitors dated  24  September  2014  confirming
    that they would not attend.  Mr Diwnycz, for the appellant,  relied  on
    the grounds of appeal.

 3. I shall refer to the appellant as the respondent and the respondent  as
    the appellant as  they  appeared  respectively  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The appellant and sponsor were unable to satisfy the  income
    provisions of the Immigration Rules.  The  judge  noted  this  at  [18]
    ("the appellant's Counsel acknowledged that  the  appellant  could  not
    demonstrate sufficient resources to meet the specified  income.")   The
    appeal therefore fell to be considered under Article 8 ECHR only.   The
    judge quoted from and placed significant reliance upon the decision  of
    the Administrative Court in M [2013] EWHC  1900  (Admin).   Indeed,  at
    [34], the judge indicated that he adopted "[the Administrative Court's]
    reasoning in its entirety."

 4. The decision of Blake J in MM has now been reversed  in  the  Court  of
    Appeal (MM [2014] EWCA  Civ  985).   The  Court  of  Appeal's  judgment
    postdates the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  having  been
    handed  down  on  11  July  2014.   Of  particular  relevance  are  the
    observations of the Court of Appeal at [136-153]:
      1. Before us the emphasis was very much on Article 8 and  Article  14.
         The judge had rejected the argument that the present cases were not
         concerned with restrictions on the right to marry alone: see [101].
         There is the associated right in Article 12 to found a family.  But
         that is so bound up with the Article 8 rights that  the  judge  was
         correct, in my view, to concentrate on those, as I shall do.
      1. Blake J's analysis of the lawfulness of the new MIR was  along  the
         lines of that of Lord Wilson in Quila and Maurice Kay LJ  in  Bibi.
         He asked whether they were  an  interference  with  Article  8  and
         Article 12 rights, concluded that they did infringe the former  and
         then went on to conclude, ultimately, that, taken as a  whole,  the
         interference was  disproportionate  and  not  justifiable.[155]  Ms
         Giovannetti accepts that the new MIR do interfere with the  Article
         8 rights of the UK partners. She was right to do so.  However,  the
         judge said that the new MIR was an interference with "three  rights
         and not just one":[156] the statutory right of the  UK  partner  to
         reside in the UK "without let or  hindrance";  the  right  of  that
         person to marry and found a family and the right to respect of  the
         private and family life created as a result of the exercise of  the
         previous rights. Moreover, in his view the interference created  by
         the new MIR was "considerably more intrusive" than  the  "colossal"
         interference identified in Quila.
      1. I would not accept the full breadth of  the  judge's  reasoning  on
         this point. The UK partner's statutory right to reside  in  the  UK
         "without let or hindrance" is, in my view,  a  personal  right.  It
         cannot be extended to others. Nor can the rights of a  person  with
         refugee or HP status be extended to others. There is nothing in the
         1971 Act or the common law that grants a "constitutional right"  of
         British citizens to live in the UK with non-EEA partners who do not
         have the right of abode in the UK  and  who  are  currently  living
         outside the UK. Of course, I accept that the UK partner (whether  a
         UK citizen of a refugee or person with HP) is entitled  to  respect
         of his or her right to marry and to found a family. But  those  are
         not absolute rights; there is no absolute right to marry and  found
         a family in the UK if it involves marriage to a non-EEA citizen who
         then wishes to reside in the UK. In Quila Lord Wilson accepted that
         the principle stated by the majority of the ECtHR in Abdulaziz,  to
         the effect that Article 8 did not impose a general obligation on  a
         member state to facilitate the choice made by a married  couple  to
         reside in it, was "unexceptionable".  With  respect,  I  agree.  In
         Quila the obstruction on the married couple exercising their choice
         of where to live was created by the total ban on marriage visas for
         those under 21. It was this total ban on all marriages with a  non-
         EEA citizen under the age  of  21  which  constituted  "a  colossal
         interference" with Article 8 rights.
      1. In this case the obstruction on the choice of  the  married  couple
         (or on two partners) to live in the UK is  a  financial  one  which
         effectively prevents all UK partners whose earnings and savings are
         below a certain amount (as calculated by the new  MIR)  from  being
         able to sponsor the entry of their non-EEA  partner.  The  new  MIR
         must therefore constitute a very significant interference with  the
         Article 8 rights of a UK partner who  cannot  fulfil  the  new  MIR
         conditions. Whether or not,  in  law,  the  non-EEA  partners  have
         "Article 8 rights", plainly their  private  and  family  lives  are
         affected if their UK partners cannot fulfil the requirements.
      1.  Therefore,  as  in  Quila  and  Bibi,  the  focus  must  shift  to
         "justification" of the new MIR under Article 8(2). The new MIR were
         created in accordance with the law. Although  it  is  not  entirely
         clear whether the judge specifically addressed  the  first  of  the
         four Huang questions on  the  topic  of  whether  the  measure  was
         "necessary in a democratic society",[157] Blake J characterised the
         general aim of the new MIR as being that "the families of  migrants
         should be encouraged by the terms of admission  to  integrate,  not
         live at or near subsistence levels and not be  perceived  to  be  a
         long term drain on the public purse in the form of increased access
         to state benefits".[158] I did not understand  the  respondents  to
         challenge that  aim  as  being  both  legitimate  and  sufficiently
         important to justify limiting the right to respect for private  and
         family life. The aim which Blake  J  identified  comes  within  the
         expression "the economic wellbeing of the country" in Article 8(2).
         The impact of migrants who join  households  with  low  incomes  on
         working  age  benefits  and  other  social  services  was  properly
         researched. The conclusion of the SSHD that the aims that  Blake  J
         identified were sufficiently important to justify limiting  Article
         8 rights was both rational and unobjectionable.
      1. However the respondents attempt to challenge the judge's conclusion
         on this point because they argue that, individually, one or more of
         the five key elements of the new MIR which Blake J lists  at  [124]
         of  his  judgment  did  not  do  anything  towards  achieving   the
         identified  and  legitimate  aims  and  so  were  not   "rationally
         connected" with the overall aim. They particularly focused  on  the
         fifth feature, viz. the disregard for non-EEA partner's own earning
         capacity during the thirty month period after initial entry.
      1. I cannot accept these arguments  in  principle.  The  Secretary  of
         State does not have to have "irrefutable empirical  evidence"  that
         the individual features of the policy  proposed  will  achieve  the
         social aim intended. It is enough that she should have  a  rational
         belief that  the  policy  will,  overall,  achieve  the  identified
         aim.[159] The new MIR were the result of a great deal  of  work  to
         identify (a) the long-term requirements of some immigrants  on  the
         welfare system and (b) what income was needed to  lessen  or  avoid
         that dependence and  how  that  income  could  be  calculated.  The
         conclusion that a family with more income would be more  likely  to
         be capable of integrating is not susceptible  of  empirical  proof,
         but a belief in the link between higher income and  the  likelihood
         of better integration is rational.
      1. As for the individual features, it is important at  this  stage  to
         remember  the  question  being  considered:  are   those   features
         "rationally connected" to the aims. The overall aim  is  sufficient
         income; but whether a family will have sufficient income depends on
         setting a certain level and then deciding  what  elements  can  and
         cannot be taken into account to see whether the relevant level will
         be reached in a particular case. Given the work of the MAC and  the
         conclusions it reached, there is clearly  a  "rational  connection"
         between both the figures chosen and the aim of the policy.  Whether
         it is proportionate or the minimum needed to achieve  the  aim  are
         different points.
      1. As for the elements  that  must  not  be  included  in  calculating
         whether the level of income has been achieved in a particular  case
         viz. no savings below �16,000; 30 month forward projection  of  the
         UK partner's income; no account for third party support  (generally
         speaking) and disregard of the non-EEA partner's  potential  income
         for 30 months, the question must be whether it is rational, bearing
         in mind the policy aim, to stipulate that those  elements  must  be
         excluded in deciding whether the relevant level of income  for  the
         household of the UK partner and non-EEA spouse will be reached. The
         respondents particularly  focused  on  the  last  element  (non-EEA
         partner's potential  income)  as  being  irrational,  not  only  in
         Convention terms but also under the common law. Reliance was placed
         on the Supreme Court's decision in Mahad.[160]
      1. There are two answers to the  respondents'  arguments,  bearing  in
         mind I am only considering at the moment the "rational  connection"
         issue. First, the executive is entitled to examine the evidence  it
         had on necessary levels of income and savings and  the  reliability
         of income or other support being received in order to take  a  view
         on what the new MIR should stipulate(as a policy  statement)  could
         be included or not in calculating whether the required income level
         had been achieved. The executive did so. It did not just  take  the
         figures or the considerations out of the air in an unthinking  way.
         Secondly, Mahad was a decision on the construction of the  relevant
         IR. The Supreme Court held that, properly construed,  the  relevant
         IR did not prohibit recourse to third party support  to  reach  the
         required minimum income requirements. The  Supreme  Court  decision
         was not concerned with the policy  issue  of  whether  third  party
         income should be disregarded in principle.
      1. Although the judge concluded that the new MIR had a legitimate aim,
         he went on to say  (at  [142])  that  the  five  economic/financial
         features of the new MIR that he had identified at  [124][161]  were
         "together... a disproportionate interference with the rights of the
         British citizen sponsors and refugees to enjoy respect  for  family
         life" and were not a "fair balance" between competing  private  and
         public interests. He went further, in  [144],  in  concluding  that
         that the five features were together "more than  was  necessary  to
         promote the legitimate aim" and that, for both UK partners who were
         British citizens or refugees (and presumably those with  HP),  they
         were an "irrational and unjustified restriction" on  their  rights,
         particularly the "constitutional rights" of British citizens. These
         two conclusions are at the  heart  of  the  appeal.  They  are  the
         judge's conclusions on the third and fourth questions posed in [19]
         of Huang, viz: are the  measures  no  more  than  is  necessary  to
         accomplish the identified aim, and do the measures  strike  a  fair
         balance between the rights of the individual and the  interests  of
         the community?
      1. The judge recognised that the SSHD was entitled  to  conclude  that
         greater resources than �5,500 per couple (without children and with
         adequate accommodation) were needed for the identified aims. But he
         concluded that the figure of  �18,600  chosen  was  more  than  the
         minimum necessary to accomplish the identified aim, particularly if
         (contrary to the stated policy) account could be taken of the  non-
         EEA partner's potential income. Therefore the SSHD  had  failed  to
         discharge the burden of demonstrating that  the  interference  with
         Article 8 rights was justified.
      1. Essentially the debate is about figures  and  what  should  be  the
         minimum necessary income figure and what other possible sources  of
         income should or should not be taken into account to  see  if  that
         minimum can be reached. This case is not the same as  Quila,  where
         the policy imposed a total ban on entry of persons between  18  and
         21 who wished to be married to UK  citizens;  or  Baiai  where  the
         policy (subject to a discretionary compassionate exception) imposed
         a "blanket prohibition  on  the  right  to  marry  at  all  in  the
         specified categories".[162] Here, the non-EEA partner can enter the
         UK, provided the UK partner's level of income, judged by the policy
         of the new MIR to be appropriate, is reached. Admittedly there is a
         total ban on the entry of non-EEA partners  where  the  UK  partner
         cannot reach the required minimum and I appreciate  that  this  ban
         could be  life-long.  But  there  has  always  been  a  maintenance
         requirement at a certain level and if that level was not reached by
         the UK partner, then there was a total ban on the entry of the non-
         EEA  partner  unless,  in  an  individual   case,   it   would   be
         disproportionate  under  Article  8(2)  to  refuse  entry  in  that
         instance. Moreover, maintenance requirements are not unique to  the
         UK and it does not set the highest minimum  annual  income;  Norway
         does.[163]
      1. So the key question is: to what extent should the court  substitute
         its own view of what, as a general policy, is the appropriate level
         of income for that rationally chosen as a matter of policy  by  the
         executive, which is headed  by  ministers  who  are  democratically
         accountable? Blake J suggested, at [147],  that  there  were  "less
         intrusive responses" that were available and he gave examples. What
         he meant by this is  that,  in  his  view,  these  "less  intrusive
         responses"  constituted  what  was  "no  more  than  necessary"  to
         accomplish the policy aim and, in  his  view,  constituted  a  fair
         balance between the rights of the individual and the  interests  of
         the community. I appreciate that proportionality has to  be  judged
         "objectively by the court".[164] However, in making this  objective
         judgment appropriate weight has to be given to the judgment of  the
         Secretary of State, particularly where, as here, she has  acted  on
         the results of independent research and wide consultations.
      1. As I have already noted, there was a keen debate before  us  as  to
         the extent to which the court will accord the executive a degree of
         flexibility as to where it  pitches  its  policy  in  the  area  of
         economic  and  social  strategy  when  the   policy   affects   the
         fundamental right of living together as  a  family.  In  Stec,  the
         ECtHR said that national  authorities  will  be  accorded  a  "wide
         margin" when it comes to "general measures of  economic  or  social
         strategy"[165] but that was in relation to  the  payment  of  state
         benefits. In Quila, Lord Wilson thought the correct approach was to
         give "appropriate weight" to the  Secretary  of  State's  view,  at
         least when it was demonstrated that this  was  based  on  a  proper
         consideration of relevant factors and evidence.[166] In  this  case
         the  evidence  of  Mr  Peckover  (as  noted  above)  is  that   the
         compatibility of the new MIR with Article 8  was  assessed  by  the
         Secretary of State as reflected in  the  Statement  on  Grounds  of
         Compatibility (paragraphs 52-64) published in June 2012.[167]
      1. I am very conscious of the evidence submitted by the  claimants  to
         demonstrate how the new MIR  will  have  an  impact  on  particular
         groups and, in particular, the evidence that only  301  occupations
         out of 422 listed in the 2011 UK Earnings data had  average  annual
         earnings over �18,600. But, given the work that was done on  behalf
         of the Secretary of State to analyse the effect of the  immigration
         of non-EEA partners and dependent children on the benefits  system,
         the level of income needed to minimise dependence on the state  for
         families where non-EEA partners enter the UK and what I regard as a
         rational conclusion on the link between better income  and  greater
         chances of integration, my conclusion  is  that  the  Secretary  of
         State's judgment cannot be impugned. She has discharged the  burden
         of  demonstrating  that  the  interference  was  both  the  minimum
         necessary and strikes a fair balance between the interests  of  the
         groups concerned and the community  in  general.  Individuals  will
         have  different  views  on  what  constitutes  the  minimum  income
         requirements needed to accomplish the stated  policy  aims.  In  my
         judgment it is not the court's job to impose its own  view  unless,
         objectively judged, the levels chosen are to  be  characterised  as
         irrational, or inherently unjust or inherently unfair. In  my  view
         they cannot be.
      1. The respondents argued that the rule making  process  had  not  had
         regard to the particular need of refugees, such as MM, who are  not
         in a position to return to their country and  may  have  difficulty
         leaving  the  UK  to  meet  their  spouse/partner.  I   accept   Ms
         Giovannetti's response that refugees could not be  more  favourably
         treated than British citizen sponsors; that would be discriminatory
         and difficult to justify. Moreover, as Mr Peckover  points  out  in
         his second witness statement,[168] the  reunion  of  refugees  with
         "pre-flight" partners and family is dealt with in Part  11  of  the
         IRs and Appendix FM does  not  apply  to  them.  Appendix  FM  only
         applies to "post-flight" families  and  it  is  logical  that  they
         should be subject to the same rules as British citizen sponsors.
      1. Therefore, my answer to Issue Three is "no,  the  judge's  analysis
         and conclusion that the new MIR were, in  principle,  incapable  of
         being compatible with the Article 8 rights of the UK partners  (and
         others if relevant) was not correct".

 5. In the  light  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's  judgment,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's determination and, in particular, its reliance upon the  now
    reversed judgment of the Administrative Court renders the determination
    unsafe.  It is clear from the determination that Judge Cox had sympathy
    for the appellant and sponsor as do I also.  However,  the  failure  of
    the appellant and sponsor to meet the  immigration  provisions  of  the
    Rules, taken together with the other facts in the case as  detailed  by
    Judge Cox, do not, in my opinion, make available  the  conclusion  that
    this out of country appeal should be allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.
     Although the judge acknowledged the  close  relationship  between  the
    appellant and sponsor and the sponsor's  close  relationship  with  his
    daughter [45] there is nothing exceptional on the facts of this case to
    justify allowing the appeal  under  Article  8  ECHR.   Obviously,  the
    financial circumstances of the family may change and a new  application
    may be made  in  due  course.   However,  that  is  a  matter  for  the
    appellant, sponsor and their advisers.

DECISION

 6. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    22 April 2014 is set aside.  I have remade the decision.  The appeal of
    the appellant against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer dated
    25 April 2013 is dismissed under the Immigration  Rules  and  on  human
    rights (Article 8 ECHR) grounds.


Signed        Date 19 November 2014
