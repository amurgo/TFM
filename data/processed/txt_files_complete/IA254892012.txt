    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: the appellant did not
           attend and was not represented
          For the Respondent: Mrs M Tanner a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 2  March  1980.
      He has been given permission to appeal the determination of First-Tier
      Tribunal  Judge  Carroll  who  dismissed  his   appeal   against   the
      respondent's decision of 31 October 2012 to refuse him leave to remain
      in the UK as a Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant  by  reference  to
      paragraph 245ZX(d) of the Immigration Rules and to remove him from the
      UK by way of directions under section 47 of the Immigration and Asylum
      and Nationality Act 2006.


   2. The appellant came to the UK on 7 November 2010 with a visa giving him
      leave to enter until 31 December 2011.  He  was  subsequently  granted
      further leave to remain from 23 January 2012 until 31 May 2012. On  30
      May 2012 he made a further application for leave to remain as a Tier 4
      (General) Student Migrant. The respondent refused the application. The
      appellant was awarded zero points under the  heading  of  "Maintenance
      (Funds)" because he had not shown that he had an established  presence
      in the UK as defined in paragraph 14 of Appendix C of the  Immigration
      Rules. As a result the appellant was required  to  show  that  he  had
      higher level of maintenance funds and had not done so.


   3. The appellant appealed and the judge heard  his  appeal  on  18  April
      2013. Both parties were represented at the hearing and  the  appellant
      gave evidence. The judge found that the appellant had not  shown  that
      he met the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  because  he  had
      neither finished a single course that was at  least  six  months  long
      within his last period of leave to remain  nor  was  he  applying  for
      continued study on a single course where he had completed at least six
      months of that course. The judge also considered the Article  8  human
      rights grounds. The appeal was dismissed.


   4. The appellant sought and was granted permission to appeal.  The  judge
      who did so did not say that he found any merit in the  grounds  except
      for the question of whether the judge should have allowed  the  appeal
      against the decision to remove the appellant from the  UK  by  way  of
      directions under s 47 of the Immigration and  Asylum  and  Nationality
      Act 2006.


   5. I have a letter from the appellant's solicitors dated 3 July  2013  in
      which they submit a skeleton argument and indicate that  neither  they
      nor the appellant will be attending the hearing. The appellant "is  in
      Pakistan due to health of his father".  Whilst  they  asked  that  the
      appeal should be determined on the papers I heard it in the absence of
      the appellant and considered both submissions from Mrs Tanner and  the
      skeleton argument.


   6. The appellant claimed to have an "established presence" in the UK.  If
      this was so then he would have to show that he had  maintenance  funds
      at a lower level than would otherwise be the case. If he did not  have
      an established presence then, studying outside Inner London, he needed
      to show that he had total funds of �8700 for the required  consecutive
      28 day period. His bank statements showed no more than �4124.25.


   7. Paragraph 14 of Appendix C of the Immigration Rules provides;


         "14. An applicant will have an established presence studying in the
         UK if the applicant has current entry clearance, leave to enter  or
         leave to remain as a Tier 4 migrant, Student or as  a  Postgraduate
         Doctor or Dentist and at the date of application:
         (i) has finished a single course that was at least six months  long
         within the applicant's last period of  entry  clearance,  leave  to
         enter or leave to remain, or
         (ii) is applying for continued study on a single course  where  the
         applicant has completed at least six months of that course, or
         (iii) is applying for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student
         on the doctorate extension scheme."

   8. The respondent's  position  is  that  the  appellant  was  last  given
      permission  to  study  at  Cardiff  Metropolitan  University  from  19
      September 2011 until 31 May 2012 (not 31  March  2012  as  incorrectly
      stated in the  refusal  letter  of  31  October  2012).  However,  the
      University told the respondent that  the  appellant  left  the  course
      after four months. The appellant claimed that he had  started  at  the
      University in August 2011, passed his first assignment but failed  the
      second submitted in November 2011. He admitted that  he  was  "exited"
      from the MBA course at the  university  on  7  February  2012  (not  2
      February 2012 which  appears  to  be  a  typographical  error  in  the
      determination).


   9. However, on the documentary evidence before him the judge  found  that
      the appellant's course started on 1 October 2011 not, as the appellant
      claimed, in August 2011. There was no documentary evidence to  support
      the appellant's  contention.  There  was  written  evidence  from  the
      University showing that the course commenced on 1  October  2011.  The
      period between 1 October 2011 and 7 February 2012 is four  months  and
      seven days. The judge found that the appellant had neither finished  a
      single course that was at least six months long within  the  his  last
      period of entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain, nor  was
      he applying for continued study  on  a  single  course  where  he  had
      completed at least six months of that course.


  10. The appellant's grounds of appeal are not entirely clear but I  cannot
      see that it assists him to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  disputed
      element of the Immigration  Rules  for  this  application  if  he  was
      granted a level 7 diploma from Stratford College of  Management  prior
      to attending Cardiff Metropolitan  University  or  if  London  Waltham
      College agreed to admit him. Indeed, the respondent  awarded  him  the
      required 30 points for the  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for  Studies
      (CAS) issued by that college. Even if he had been granted  a  level  7
      diploma by Stratford College of Management this  did  not  demonstrate
      that he had the required "established presence".  As  the  application
      form makes clear  the  appellant  relied  on  his  course  at  Cardiff
      Metropolitan University as the course which was at  least  six  months
      long within his last period of entry clearance.


  11. The appellant also claims that he appealed  against  the  decision  of
      Cardiff Metropolitan University to "exit" him and there is documentary
      evidence to show that he did. However, the  appellant  said  that  the
      appeal process had not been completed  by  the  time  of  the  hearing
      before the judge and he has not provided any evidence to show that  it
      has been completed even now. On the other hand,  he  admits  that  his
      final project "was not up to the standard of the University".


  12. I cannot find any merit in the  grounds  that  argue  that  the  judge
      should have reached a different conclusion in relation to the  Article
      8 grounds because the appellant had a right to a continuing  education
      in this country.


  13. The line of authorities culminating in Adamally and Jaferi (section 47
      removal  decisions:  Tribunal  Procedures)  [2012]  UKUT  00414  (IAC)
      establishes that when a removal decision purportedly under s 47 of the
      Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 is made concurrently with
      a decision refusing further leave the s 47 decision is  unlawful,  but
      the decision refusing leave is  a  separate  decision,  that  requires
      determination; s 85(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
      2002 brings the two decisions into one appeal, but s 86  of  that  Act
      allows and  requires  the  determination  to  reflect  differences  in
      outcome. The judge was correct  to  determine  the  decision  refusing
      further leave but should have allowed the appellant's  appeal  against
      the s 47 removal decision. To this extent  he  erred  in  law  as  Mrs
      Tanner concedes.


  14. I find that the judge erred in law by failing to allow the appellant's
      appeal against the s 47 removal decision. To this extent I  set  aside
      her decision and remake it by allowing the appeal against the  against
      the s 47 removal decision. In relation to the judge's  decision  under
      the Immigration Rules and the Article 8 human rights  grounds  I  find
      that the judge did not err in law and I uphold her decision.
