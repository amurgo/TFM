    Representation:
    For the Appellant: Ms Praisoody, Counsel, instructed by Your Right
    Solicitors
    For the Respondent:     Mr Walker (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1.  The  appellants,  born  January  1,  1984  and   September   4,   1985
    respectively, are citizens of Bangladesh. The first-named appellant was
    granted a Tier 1 (Post study) visa on February  25,  2012  valid  until
    January 31, 2014. On January 21, 2014 he made an application for  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  and  his  wife  made  an
    application to remain as his dependant. At all times  the  second-named
    appellant was in the United Kingdom as his  dependant.  The  respondent
    refused the applications on June 16, 2014 and issued  directions  under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.  The
    substantive  application  was  refused  because  the   respondent   was
    satisfied the United bank letter dated January 21, 2014 was false.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on June 26, 2014.

 3. On September  19,  2014  Judge  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Birrell
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") was  asked  to  deal  with  the
    appeal on the papers and in determination  promulgated  on  October  2,
    2014 she refused their appeals on the basis false  documents  had  been
    produced. At paragraph [10] she stated-

         "On the file I had the material before the Home office  during  the
         making of the decision. I had a copy  of  the  reason  for  refusal
         letter. The appellant put in an appeal on June 26. 2014 and he  did
         not set out the grounds of appeal but  indicated  that  they  would
         follow. On 20 August an application was received  by  the  Tribunal
         for an extension of time to  file  the  grounds  as  the  appellant
         denied that the letter was false but needed  more  time  to  get  a
         response from the bank and this application was granted.  The  time
         allowed was extended until 7 September 2014 and I note that nothing
         has subsequently been provided by the appellant."

 4. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal  on  October  7,  2014  and  on
    November  14,  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Deans   gave
    permission to appeal finding there were arguable grounds that the  FtTJ
    may have erred through  a  procedural  irregularity  namely  there  was
    evidence that a bundle of documents had been  sent  but  had  not  been
    placed before the FtTJ.

 5. The matter came before me on December 23, 2014 and at that  hearing  Mr
    Walker accepted an email that had been sent but had not made the FtTJ's
    file and was not  before  the  FtTJ.  He  accepted  there  had  been  a
    procedural error and he invited me to adjourn the hearing to  have  the
    document adduced verified. He further  confirmed  that  the  only  live
    issue in this appeal was the genuineness of the  original  document.  I
    found there was an error although I made it clear no fault attached  to
    the FtTJ who dealt with the file as it was presented to her.

 6. I initially adjourned the appeal until February 26, 2015  but  on  that
    date the respondent indicated she had not received the documents and  I
    agreed to adjourn the case further. I gave directions and on March  19,
    2015  the  respondent  wrote  to  the  tribunal  and  the   appellants'
    representatives attaching a copy of additional evidence.

 7. A notice of today's hearing was  sent  out  on  March  25,  2015.  Both
    appellants were in attendance and the parties were represented  as  set
    out above.

 8. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and I see no reason to alter that order.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 9. Ms Praisoody asked for an adjournment. She  explained  the  first-named
    appellant had spoken to the bank and they had  assured  him  they  knew
    nothing of any emails sent. She further argued that the fact the  email
    addresses were redacted meant a proper enquiry could not be  made.  She
    asked for an adjournment to investigate the matter further.

10. Mr Walker objected and argued that this was a never-ending  cycle.  The
    respondent had submitted evidence that demonstrated the original letter
    was fraudulent and now further evidence had  been  provided  confirming
    other documents were fraudulent. If another letter  was  produced  this
    would have to be checked and it would be never  ending.  No  steps  had
    been taken to produce anything to suggest the  documents  submitted  by
    the respondent could not be relied on.

11. Having considered the respective submissions and having  regard  to  my
    powers under Rule 5(h) of the Tribunal Procedure (upper Tribunal) Rules
    2008 I refused the adjournment. The evidence had been sent out on March
    19, 2015 and  there  was  no  suggestion  the  document  had  not  been
    received. The notice of hearing for today was sent  out  on  March  25,
    2015 and there had  been  no  contact  from  the  appellants  or  their
    representatives except on May 1,  2015  a  notification  of  change  of
    solicitor.  In  light  of  the  allegation  it  was  incumbent  on  the
    appellants to obtain the appropriate evidence to counter the claim made
    and there had been no attempt to do this. I directed the hearing  would
    proceed.

SUBMISSIONS

12. Mr Walker invited me to accept the evidence placed before the FtTJ  and
    me that demonstrated fraudulent documents had been submitted. The  case
    was now even stronger than when it appeared  before  the  FtTJ  because
    there were now more fraudulent letters than before. There was  evidence
    of the emails sent and the  responses  that  could  be  relied  on.  He
    invited me to dismiss the appeal under paragraph 322(1A) HC 395.

13. Ms Praisoody had no submissions to make in light of the recent evidence
    and my refusal to adjourn to the case.

FINDINGS

14. The appellant produced three letters from the United Bank Limited dated
    January 21, 2014 (two letters) and August 27, 2014. On June 5, 2014 the
    Operations Manager for the bank confirmed they had not issued the first
    two letters and therefore they were not genuine. On March 9,  2015  the
    bank confirmed in email that the latest letter was "fake" and the  bank
    had not issued the letter.

15. The first letters had  been  issued  confirming  Mawish  Imran  had  an
    account at the bank and it contained a fixed amount of money on certain
    days. The bank found these documents to be fake  and  to  address  that
    information the appellants provided another  letter  dated  August  27,
    2014 in which the authenticity of the original letters were upheld.

16. I am satisfied to the higher standard of proof that  the  letters  were
    fraudulent. The respondent has produced sufficient evidence to  satisfy
    the burden she bears.

17. The appellants have produced no reliable evidence to counter the recent
    emails despite having had ample opportunity to do so. I place no weight
    on any purported conversation between  the  bank  and  the  first-named
    appellant.

18. I dismiss the appeal under  paragraph  322(1A)  and  245DD  HC  395.  I
    dismiss it under paragraph  322(1A)  HC  395  because  I  am  satisfied
    fraudulent documents have been used and I dismiss it under 245DD HC 395
    because the appellants have failed to satisfy  the  requirement  within
    the Rules that they have the specified funds available.

DECISION

19. There was a material error. I have remade the decision and dismiss  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.
