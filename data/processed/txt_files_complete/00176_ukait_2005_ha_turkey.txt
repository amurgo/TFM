                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

This case is reported only for the guidance on citation of decisions of  the
Tribunal and courts given at � 3: the remainder  of  our  decision  can  and
should be disregarded.

   This is a case where permission was given to appeal from a  decision  of
   an adjudicator (Mr DP Herbert), sitting at Taylor House on  8  September
   2004, dismissing an asylum and human rights appeal by a Kurdish  citizen
   of Turkey. Under the transitional provisions of the 2004 Act,  the  case
   proceeds as if it were a reconsideration following review by the  Asylum
   and Immigration Tribunal; but only (see r. 62.7 of  the  2005  Procedure
   Rules) on the grounds on which permission was given. These were that

    a) the facts of the case arguably  did  not  support  the  adjudicator's
       findings; and
    b) his approach might have been governed by what had previously been the
       leading 'country guidance' cases, which had been  overtaken  by  more
       recent material.

2. The adjudicator's approach to citation can most politely be described as
   rather cavalier: he relied mainly on A (Turkey) CG [2003]  UKIAT  00034,
   but without giving the year or serial number at  all  (as  well  as  the
   previous leading case of Hayser [2002] UKIAT 07083, without any citation
   whatsoever); then he referred to what appears to have been HO  (National
   Records) Turkey CG [2004]  UKIAT  00038,  by  a  partial  and  incorrect
   citation, UKIAT 000380 (Turkey). While some may consider  this  a  minor
   point, it is not best practice and does little to encourage that amongst
   representatives, qualified or unqualified, on either side; it also  lays
   judges open to the suspicion, justified or not,  that  they  have  never
   actually read the decisions  on  which  they  purport  to  rely.  It  is
   particularly unfortunate when everyone in this field is having  to  cope
   with an anonymized reporting system which makes electronic searches much
   more problematic than they would have  been with proper names. We  shall
   try and give some guidance as to what ought to be done.

3. At least on the  first  occasion  a  case  is  mentioned,  the  name  or
   initials, the  court  abbreviation,  the  year  and  serial  number  are
   required: other parts of the full  citation,  such  as  the  country  of
   origin or the 'key-word' may be added; but that is a matter of taste, as
   they do not help the searcher who has the rest. It is also just as  well
   for decision-writers to show they  realize  whether  it  is  a  'country
   guidance' or 'starred' case. In the above example, HO (CG) [2004]  UKIAT
   00038 would do[1]; but nothing less. Decisions of either the Tribunal or
   the courts reached since the advent of 'neutral citation' should  always
   be cited under that system[2]: those from  before  should  be  given  if
   possible from either of the sets of specialized  reports  likely  to  be
   most easily accessible to practitioners in this field[3].

4. In this case the adjudicator was criticized in the grounds of appeal for
   not referring to more recent decisions of the Tribunal  than  those  set
   out above: as it turned out by the time permission to appeal was  given,
   this was of historical interest only,  since  these  in  turn  had  been
   superseded by IK (Turkey) CG  [2004]  UKIAT  00312,  which  remains  the
   'country guidance' case in this area. Mr Saunders wisely saw  no  useful
   purpose in pursuing the question of whether the adjudicator had followed
   orthodox doctrine as of the time he was writing; needless to say,  there
   would be no mistake of law in failing to anticipate IK 04-312, though on
   the other hand  that  decision  could  help  to  support  the  view  the
   adjudicator took of the situation at the date of the hearing before him,
   only a few weeks before that in IK 04-312.

5. In the event Mr Saunders restricted the grounds he pursued to � 3, which
   complained of the adjudicator's � 59. This read:

   I also find that it is likely that  there  would  be  some  computerised
   record of this appellant's detentions even if it were not to be recorded
   upon the GBTS system. It is inconceivable that a  state  which  conducts
   such wide-scale repression, even of one's legal party such as HADEP  and
   who uses incarceration as a means of harassment.

   Mr Saunders made some mild  complaint  of  the  grammar  of  the  second
   sentence: we are not a court of syntax, and we think the less said about
   that, the better. His  real  complaint  was  that  the  adjudicator  had
   referred to no evidence in support of  his  finding  about  the  record,
   possibly not on GBTS. As Mr Saunders accepted, this could only amount to
   a material error of law  by  the  adjudicator  if  both  there  were  no
   evidence capable of supporting the finding; and that finding might  have
   affected his decision on the case as a whole.

6. Mr Collins in turn complained that � 3 of the grounds raised not the non-
   GBTS records relied on by the adjudicator, but the question (which he had
   explicitly discounted) of whether or not there would  be  anything  about
   the appellant on the GBTS itself. He described Mr Saunders's  relying  on
   it in the way he did as "disingenuous": whether he fully  understood  the
   meaning of this word, much ruder than it sounds, was not clear to us. For
   our part, we should prefer to describe Mr  Saunders's  advocacy  on  this
   occasion as making the best he could of a bad job: while it may not  have
   represented the best use  of  public  time,  it  at  least  gave  us  the
   opportunity of reaching a reasoned decision.

7. There are a number of reasons why the point to which  Mr  Saunders  found
   himself reduced cannot show any material error of law on the part of  the
   adjudicator: we hope he will not mind us giving them in summary form.

    a) Unhelpful as it was for the adjudicator not to cite the  evidence  on
       which he relied (and to which Mr Collins assured us he referred  him)
       for the appellant's likely appearance on non-GBTS records, the result
       he reached on this point was at least retrospectively validated by IK
       04-312 at � 71-76.
    b) � 3  of  the  grounds  of  appeal  did  complain  of  a  finding  the
       adjudicator had not made, as to the appellant's appearance on GBTS.
    c) The adjudicator's finding on the records was not something  on  which
       he regarded his decision as turning: this was clearly enough shown by
       his beginning � 59 "I also find ...".
    d) His reliance on the risk he found in the appellant's home area was in
       line with IK 04-312, and not challenged  in  the  grounds  of  appeal
       (drafted before that decision came out).
    e) The concentration on that point in IK 04-312  means  that,  unless  a
       finding of risk in the home area can be  successfully  challenged  on
       its own terms, it is only open to collateral  attack  by  challenging
       the finding (or the failure to make a finding)  on  internal  flight,
       which again was not done in this case: the Tribunal in IK 04-312 also
       had a good deal to say about the internal flight alternative.

The original Tribunal did not make a material error of law and the  original
determination of the appeal stands.

[1]   This is for the first occasion it is  mentioned:  after  that,  either
   the name or initials alone (so long as those are unique in the  decision
   under construction) are acceptable, though the writer's own  preference,
   where initials are concerned, is to retain a shortened form of the  year
   and serial number which ensures that the reference remains unique -  for
   example HO 04-38.
