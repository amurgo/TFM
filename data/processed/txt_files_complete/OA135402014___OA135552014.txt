Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Sharma, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


   1. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan born on 10 January 1976 and 15
      June 1996 respectively. The second appellant is the child of the first
      appellant. The appeals have therefore been linked and heard  together.
      Both appellants are seeking to join the first appellant's husband,  Mr
      Mohammed Hassan Khan ("the sponsor"), in the UK for  settlement.   The
      sponsor is the father of the second appellant, who was under 18 at the
      date of application.


   Error of law - Appendix FM-SE


   2. The issues in these appeals are well summarized in the decision of the
      First-tier Tribunal granting the appellants permission to appeal:




         "1.  In a Decision promulgated on 3 September  2015  Judge  of  the
         First-tier  Tribunal  Hussain  dismissed  the  Appellants'  appeals
         against the Respondent's decisions to refuse them  entry  clearance
         for settlement in the UK with their husband/father.


         2.   The issue  in  the  appeal  was  whether  the  Appellants  had
         produced the evidence required by Appendix FM-SE  relating  to  the
         Sponsor's income, specifically whether the bank statements covering
         the same period as the tax return had been produced.


         3.   The Respondent assessed the evidence  with  reference  to  the
         Sponsor's claimed income of �22,798. That is the  income  shown  on
         his tax calculations for the year  2013/14.  The  Respondent  found
         that the bank statements produced did not cover that entire year.


         4.   The Judge approached the matter on the basis that the relevant
         year was 2012/13, and that since the Sponsor's income in that  year
         was only �12,869 the appeal could not succeed under the Immigration
         Rules.


         5.   The grounds on which permission to  appeal  is  sought  submit
         that the Judge misdirected himself as to  the  year  on  which  the
         appellants were basing their application.


         6.   There appears to be confusion, which I cannot unravel,  as  to
         the correct year. The Respondent quoted the income for 2013/14  but
         the entry clearance applications were made  before  that  year  had
         ended. The ECM took the correct year to be 2012/13. I consider that
         this part of the grounds is arguable.


         7.   The grounds make further submissions in respect of Article  8.
         These have no arguable merit."




   3. I heard submissions from the representatives  as  to  which  year  the
      Judge should have taken into account. However, at the beginning of the
      hearing, Mr  Sharma  also  indicated  that  he  wished  to  apply  for
      permission to appeal on  the  ground  on  which  permission  had  been
      refused by the First-tier Tribunal, namely article 8. I said  I  would
      hear submissions on the matter of  the  interpretation  of  the  rules
      first because, if the appellants could succeed on that  ground,  there
      would be no need to consider article 8.


   4. Before setting out the submissions and my interpretation of the rules,
      it is helpful to set out the background in more detail.


   5. It appears to be common ground that, if the correct financial year  is
      2012/13, then the appellants cannot succeed under the  rules  for  the
      reasons given by Judge Hussain, namely that the sponsor's income  from
      self-employment as a mini-cab  driver  fell  below  the  threshold  of
      �22,400. The sponsor earned only �12,869 in  that  year  according  to
      HMRC records. Moreover, he had not provided a  complete  set  of  bank
      statements to correspond to that tax year. On the other hand,  if  the
      correct year were 2013/14, then the appellants might succeed under the
      rules provided they could meet the evidential requirements of Appendix
      FM-SE. If the specified evidence could not be provided then any  error
      on the part of the First-tier Tribunal was immaterial.


   6. The date of application was 5 March 2014 and the date of decision  was
      16 October 2014. In other words, there had been a change of  tax  year
      in between the applications and the decisions being made. This  matter
      lies at the heart of the dispute in this case.


   7. In their visa applications the appellants indicated they relied on the
      sponsor's  self-employment  and  that  they  could  meet  the  �22,400
      threshold.  Submitted  with  the  applications  were  copies  of   the
      sponsor's tax returns, statements  of  account  and  evidence  of  the
      payment of tax for 2012/13. The sponsorship details contained  in  the
      appendix  to  the  visa  application  forms  indicated  the  sponsor's
      earnings were �24,798. However, this is  the  figure  taken  from  the
      sponsor's accountant's letter of  3  March  2014  which  confirmed  he
      earned �24,798 profit before tax during the 12- month period  1  March
      2013 to 28 February 2014, which straddles the two tax years.


   8. In the notice of  decision  the  entry  clearance  officer  notes  the
      claimed income as being �24,798  and  then  sets  out  the  evidential
      requirements of Appendix FM-SE. There were two  reasons  for  refusal.
      Firstly, the sponsor's bank statements  only  covered  the  period  14
      January 2013 to 7 March 2014, which did not cover  the  same  12-month
      period as the tax return submitted. Secondly, the bank statements were
      not originals. In relation to the first point it can be observed  that
      the bank statements  considered  fell  within  the  2013/14  tax  year
      whereas the tax returns related to the previous year.


   9. The grounds of appeal submitted on behalf of  the  appellants  do  not
      address the point about which tax year should be taken  into  account.
      They argue the entry  clearance  officer  should  have  requested  any
      missing bank statements, relying on paragraph 245AA(b)(i) of the rules
      (missing documents from a  sequence).  The  grounds  assert  the  bank
      statements were genuine.


  10. In reviewing the decision the entry clearance manager picks up on  the
      point about the  tax  year.  The  sponsor's  tax  returns  related  to
      2012/13. However, the bank statements provided covered the period from
      16 November 2012 to 13 December 2013. It is curious that  the  notices
      of decision showed the statements ran until 7 March 2014 but it is  at
      least clear that bank statements for the period 6  April  2012  to  15
      November 2012  had  not  been  provided.  In  relation  to  evidential
      flexibility, the  entry  clearance  manager  notes  that  the  missing
      statements had still not been provided.


  11. At the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal  it  appears  to  have  been
      accepted on behalf of the appellants  that  the  appropriate  year  to
      consider was 2012/13. The Judge notes  the  appellants  accepted  they
      could not comply with the requirements of Appendix FM-SE at  the  date
      of application (see paragraph 10) and also that  the  relevant  period
      was 6 April 2012 to 5 April 2013 (see paragraph 11).


  12. The relevant provisions of Appendix FM-SE are as follows:


         "7. In respect of self-employment in the UK as a partner, as a sole
         trader or in a franchise all of the following must be provided:

         out); and
         (ii) Statement of Account (SA300 or SA302).
         (c) Proof of registration with HMRC as self-employed if available.
         (d) Each partner's Unique Tax Reference Number (UTR) and/or the UTR

         tax return(s) showing that the income from self-employment has been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in the name of
         the person and their partner jointly.
         (g) Evidence of ongoing self-employment through evidence of payment
         of Class 2 National Insurance contributions.
         (h) One of the following documents must also be submitted:
         (i) (aa) If the business is  required  to  produce  annual  audited
         accounts, such accounts for the last full financial year;  or  (bb)
         If the business is not required to produce annual audited accounts,
         unaudited  accounts  for  the  last  full  financial  year  and  an
         accountant's certificate of confirmation, from an accountant who is
         a member of a UK Recognised Supervisory Body  (as  defined  in  the

         VAT return for the last full financial year (a copy  or  print-out)
         confirming the VAT registration number, if turnover is in excess of
         �79,000 or was in excess of the threshold which applied during  the
         last full  financial  year;  (iii)  Evidence  to  show  appropriate
         planning permission or local planning authority consent is held  to
         operate the type/class of business at the  trading  address  (where

         agreement signed by both parties. (i) The document referred  to  in
         paragraph 7(h)(iv) must  be  provided  if  the  organisation  is  a
         franchise.
          ...


         Calculating Gross Annual Income under Appendix FM


         13. Based on evidence that meets the requirements of this Appendix,
         and can be taken into account with reference to the applicable
         provisions of Appendix FM, gross annual income under paragraphs E-
         ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1., E-ECC.2.1. and E-LTRC.2.1. will be
         calculated in the following ways:
         ...
         (e) Where the person is self-employed, their  gross  annual  income
         will be the total of their gross income from their self-employment,
         from any salaried or non-salaried employment they have had or their
         partner has had (if their partner is in the UK with  permission  to
         work), from specified non-employment income  received  by  them  or
         their partner, and from income from a UK or foreign  State  pension
         or a private pension received by them or their partner, in the last
         full financial year or as an average of the last two full financial
         years. The requirements of this  Appendix  for  specified  evidence
         relating to these forms of income shall apply as if  references  to
         the date of application were references to the end of the  relevant
         financial  year(s).  The  relevant  financial  year(s)  cannot   be
         combined with any financial year(s) to which  paragraph  9  applies
         and vice versa."


  13. The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal directed himself  that  paragraph
      7(f)  of  Appendix  FM-SE  was  mandatory.  He  said  that,   as   the
      applications had been made on 5 March 2014, the "relevant period"  was
      6 April 2012 to 5 April 2013.


  14. Mr Sharma told me the sponsor's financial year runs from  February  to
      February,  which  reflects  the  accountant's  letter  sent  with  the
      application. He also argued that, if the rules should  be  interpreted
      as meaning the last full year before the date  of  application,  there
      was a tension with section 85A(2) of the Nationality, Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002, which provided that the tribunal should consider  the
      circumstances appertaining at the date of decision. He argued that  it
      was not sensible to restrict the appellants to  consideration  of  the
      2012/13 year, which was so long ago. To do so leads to absurdity.


  15. Ms Fijiwala argued the rules mean the last full financial year  before
      the application because that interpretation enables an entry clearance
      officer to consider the documents submitted with the  application.  If
      an application had been made late in  the  financial  year  the  entry
      clearance officer would  have  to  request  further  documents  before
      reaching a decision. The tribunal should look at the same year as  the
      entry clearance officer.


  16. I remind myself of the guidance given by Lord Brown  in  Mahad  [2009]
      UKSC 16 that the proper approach to  the  construction  of  the  rules
      depends  on  the  language  used  construed   against   the   relevant
      background, which involves consideration of the rules as a  whole  and
      the function they serve in the administration of  immigration  policy.
      The rules are not to be construed with all the  strictness  applicable
      to the construction of a statute but, instead, sensibly  according  to
      the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used,  recognising  they
      are statements of the Secretary of State's administrative policy.


  17. I was told there is no definition of  "full  financial  year"  in  the
      rules.


  18.  I  have  looked  at  the  Collins  online  dictionary  definition  of
      "financial year" which highlights that the term can  mean  any  period
      used by a particular firm at the end of which its annual accounts  are
      made up, as well as the period ending on 5 April, which  functions  as
      the tax year.


  19. I have also looked at the respondent's guidance  document  Immigration
      Directorate Instruction Family  Migration:  Appendix  FM  Section  1.7
      Appendix Armed Forces  Financial  Requirement  of  August  2015.   The
      section on self-employment states as follows:


         "9.1 Category F: Last full financial year


         9.1.1    Where the applicant's partner ...  is  in  self-employment
         ... in the UK, at the date of application, they can use income from
         the last full financial year to meet the financial requirement."


  20. Paragraph 9.3.1 of the same document states as follows:


         "For  those  self-employed  as  a  sole  trader  ...  the  relevant
         financial year(s) will be that covered by the  self-assessment  tax
         return and in the UK  this  runs  from  6  April  to  5  April  the
         following year."


  21. I appreciate this guidance had not been published when the  appellants
      made their applications or even by the date of decision.  Nor  is  the
      guidance to be used as an aid to the correct construction of the rules
      (ZH (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 8, paragraph 32). They are not
      surrogate rules even though they may illuminate the  intention  behind
      the rules. They are written primarily for decision-makers rather  than
      applicants. I mention the IDIs in this  case  simply  to  exclude  the
      possibility of the appellants relying on them  as  a  support  to  the
      interpretation of the rules which they seek.


  22. It might be  said  that  it  would  have  been  a  simple  matter  for
      Parliament to restrict the meaning of "full  financial  year"  to  the
      complete tax year immediately prior to the date  of  application.  The
      rules set out above do not in terms contain any such  restriction.  It
      is possible to make sense of them without reading such  a  restriction
      into them, albeit  this  could  cause  the  kind  of  confusion  which
      concerned Ms Fijiwala and which this case amply illustrates.


  23. I note that Appendix FM-SE  begins  with  general  requirements  which
      envisage there being specified periods during  which  income  must  be
      shown: see, for example, paragraphs A1(b)(ii), 1(a)(iv)  and  1(l).  I
      also note that, for example, the  requirements  for  employed  persons
      receiving a salary contain a specific  provision  that  payslips  must
      cover a six-month period prior to the date of  application  (paragraph
      2(a)(i)).


  24. Having carefully considered  the  rules  and  the  arguments  made,  I
      incline towards giving the  rules  a  meaning  which  provides  for  a
      uniform approach and which therefore requires  the  reference  to  the
      last full financial year to mean the year which  ended  prior  to  the
      date of application.  Whilst  'financial  year'  can  have  a  meaning
      different from tax year in ordinary parlance I also conclude that  the
      term means the tax year in the particular context of the rules  so  as
      to mesh with the evidential requirements to provide HMRC documents.


  25. For the purposes of this appeal it follows that the appellants  cannot
      succeed and Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hussain  was  correct  to
      interpret the rules as requiring the appellants to show the  financial
      requirements were met by reference to the tax year 2012/13, as counsel
      who represented the appellants  on  that  occasions  appears  to  have
      conceded.


  26. This interpretation does not  lead  to  absurdity.  Whilst  delays  in
      listing appeals means the period under  consideration  may  be  fairly
      distant this interpretation avoids the difficulty caused  by  shifting
      the period forwards and  thereby  imposing  fresh  specified  evidence
      requirements on appellants. There is no tension between this  approach
      and section 85A(2). As seen,  the  rules  contain  many  instances  of
      evidential requirements being linked to a time period. Appellants  are
      permitted to adduce evidence  of  the  period  in  question  at  their
      appeals.


  27. On the issue on which permission to appeal  was  granted,  I  find  no
      error in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  The  appellants  do
      not meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM-SE.


   Article 8 - permission to appeal refused


  28. The Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  found  there  was  no  need  to
      consider article 8 outside the rules because there were no  compelling
      or  exceptional  circumstances  to  require  him  to  do  so.  In  the
      alternative, he found the public interest prevailed.


  29. The appellants' grounds seeking permission to appeal argue  the  Judge
      did not appear to have considered that the family was separated and  a
      second-stage consideration had not been given.  As noted,  the  First-
      tier Tribunal refused to grant permission to appeal on this ground.


  30. Mr Sharma provided a completed  IAUT-1  application  form  and  sought
      permission to appeal against the Judge's decision  on  article  8.  He
      reminded me of the discussion in Ferrer (limited appeal grounds; Alvi)
      [2012] UKUT 00304 (IAC)  in  which  the  Upper  Tribunal  appeared  to
      recommend  that  there  was  little  utility  in  refusing  to   grant
      permission on some grounds but granting  permission  on  others.  More
      significantly for the purposes of this appeal, it provided guidance on
      the need, at least in this Chamber, for the obtaining of permission to
      appeal.


  31. In making his submissions as to  why  I  should  grant  permission  to
      appeal at this late stage, Mr Sharma emphasized what he considered  to
      be the strong merits of the article 8 ground.  He reminded me of  what
      the Court of Appeal said about "near misses" under the  rules  in  the
      context of overseas appeals concerning family members  in  SSHD  v  SS
      (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 (paragraphs 54 to 58). He pointed out that
      there was no remedy for the second appellant in re-applying because he
      had now reached the age of 18.


  32. Ms Fijiwala made no submissions on whether I should  grant  permission
      to appeal but said that, in the event I did so, she would ask  for  an
      adjournment to consider this new matter.


  33. I refuse permission to appeal on article 8 grounds for  the  following
      reasons.


  34. Neither the grounds originally submitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      nor Mr Sharma's amplified grounds contain arguable merit. The  grounds
      are no more than mere disagreement with the Judge's primary  decision,
      which was that the circumstances did not merit  consideration  outside
      the rules.


  35. The Judge was plainly aware that the family is currently separated. He
      was told the family members missed each other  and  dreamed  of  being
      together. The refusal had led to unnecessary hardship.  These  matters
      are  contained  in  the  sponsor's  statement.  The  original   letter
      accompanying  the  applications  stated  the  sponsor  and  the  first
      appellant married in 1994 and the visa application  form  stated  they
      had lived together for eight years after the marriage. The  Judge  was
      not told anything about when or why the sponsor  left  his  family  to
      come to the UK or why no application  had  been  made  until  now.  It
      appears family life was maintained chiefly through annual visits  made
      by the sponsor to Pakistan.


  36. The Court of Appeal in SS (Congo) made it clear  that  the  compelling
      circumstances test applied with equal vigour to Appendix FM-SE  as  to
      the substantive rules in Appendix FM (see paragraphs 50 to 53).  Judge
      Hussain applied the correct test. Although he does not go on  to  give
      clear reasons for  his  finding  that  there  were  no  compelling  or
      exceptional  circumstances,  they  are  implicit  in  his  alternative
      consideration of article 8 outside the rules. In fact, his emphasis on
      the importance of the financial requirements being met as  an  element
      of the public interest in maintaining immigration controls echoes  the
      Court of Appeal's justification for its decision that  the  compelling
      circumstances test should apply. It held that the  specified  evidence
      rules were a necessary part of ensuring applicants were not  a  burden
      on public resources.


  37. Judge Hussain did not arguably err in considering near-miss arguments,
      as discussed in SS (Congo) unless the point was put to him and  it  is
      not possible to say from the decision that  it  was.  There  was  some
      evidence showing the  sponsor's  earnings  from  self-employment  were
      sufficient to meet the threshold during the tax year in which the date
      of decision fell. However, it is far from  clear  that  the  available
      evidence would  have  met  all  the  specified  evidence  requirements
      contained in paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE for that year. Therefore it
      has not been shown any error was material.


  38. Finally, the grounds are incorrect in suggesting the Judge  failed  to
      make a second-stage assessment. His primary finding was that a second-
      stage assessment was not required. However, he went on to make one  in
      case he was wrong in any event.  The Judge  took  account  of  section
      117B of the 2002 Act and referred to the need not to use article 8  as
      a means of circumventing the rules. He also took account of  the  best
      interests of the second appellant. He was almost 18  at  the  date  of
      application and had lived all his life in Pakistan with his mother. It
      was in his best  interests  to  remain  with  his  mother.  The  Judge
      therefore appears to have taken into  account  all  relevant  matters,
      weighed them and reached a rational  conclusion.  I  see  no  arguable
      error or law in his approach.
