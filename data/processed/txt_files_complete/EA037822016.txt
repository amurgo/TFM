Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr K Alim, Counsel (Vine Court Chambers)
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1.    Permission to appeal was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
           Farelly on 15 February 2018, against the dismissal of the appeal
           seeking the issue of a residence card under  regulations  7  and
           8(5) of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
           2006 (as amended) ("the EEA Regulations") by First-tier Tribunal
           Judge Beg in a determination promulgated on 24 August 2017.  The
           Appellant is a national of Ghana, born on  10  April  1968.   He
           relied on a proxy marriage in Ghana which Judge  Beg  ruled  was
           shown by the evidence to be invalid under Ghanaian law.


      2.     That  decision  was  free-standing,  such  that   the   judge's
           references to Kareem (Proxy marriages  -  EU  law)  [2014]  UKUT
           00024 (IAC) and TA and Others (Kareem  explained)  Ghana  [2014]
           UKUT 00316 (IAC), (since overruled  by  Awuku  [2016]  EWCA  Civ
           1301), are almost certainly not material.  The judge's  decision
           was  based  on  a  proper   construction   of   the   lex   loci
           celebrationis.


      3.    There was, however, a further problem, although again  and  also
           through no fault of Judge Beg.  At the  time  the  decision  and
           reasons was prepared, Sala [2016] UKUT 411  (IAC)  applied,  and
           the judge therefore held that the tribunal  could  not  consider
           the alternative claim made by the Appellant under Regulation  8,
           the allegedly durable relationship relied on, as  there  was  no
           jurisdiction.  In SM (Algeria) [2018] UKSC 9, Sala  (above)  was
           held to be wrongly decided.  Hence findings  about  the  durable
           relationship claimed should have been made.


      4.    Mr  Tarlow  for  the  Secretary  of  State  accepted  Mr  Alim's
           submission that in these circumstances the decision and  reasons
           could not stand.


      5.    It was thus accepted that the appeal would have to be reheard by
           another judge in the First-tier Tribunal.


      6.    Hence the tribunal finds that there was a material error of  law
           in the decision and reasons (through no fault of the  judge  who
           applied the law as it then stood).


      DECISION


      There was a  material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
      determination, which is set aside.


      The original appeal must be reheard in the First-tier Tribunal, by any
      judge except First-tier Tribunal Judge Beg.
