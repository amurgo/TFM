Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr H Khalids
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 24th August  1991.   The
    Appellant was  granted  leave  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1
    entrepreneur valid until 20th August 2016.  On 14th  February  2015  he
    returned to the United Kingdom via Dubai having visited Pakistan.

 2. The Appellant was detained on his re-entry to the  United  Kingdom  and
    following an interview a decision was taken to cancel his leave on  the
    grounds that he had made false representations, or that material  facts
    were not disclosed for the purpose of  obtaining  his  leave,  or  that
    there had been such a change of circumstances in  his  case  since  the
    leave was granted that it should be cancelled.

 3. Leave to enter and notice of cancellation  of  leave  were  dated  14th
    February 2015 and issued  out  of  Gatwick  Airport,  North  Terminal's
    Immigration Department.  Grounds of Appeal were lodged  and  they  were
    refused in a Notice of Refusal dated 9th April 2015.  Those Grounds  of
    Refusal relied on the  standard  generic  witness  statement  of  Peter
    Millington and  Rebecca  Collings  purporting  a  contention  that  the
    Appellant  had  used  deception  in  obtaining  the  English   language
    certificate which he had then used to obtain his leave to remain in the
    United Kingdom.

 4. The appeal came before Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Mulholland
    sitting at Taylor  House  on  20th  January  2016  and  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 29th January 2016 the  Appellant's  appeal  was  allowed
    under the Immigration Rules.  It is relevant to note that the  original
    appeal was dealt with on the papers.

 5. On 1st February 2016 the Secretary of State lodged Grounds of Appeal to
    the Upper  Tribunal.   Those  grounds  contended  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had failed to provide adequate reasons for  the  finding
    that the evidence provided was inadequate and that, taking into account
    the generic witness statements of Peter Millington and Rebecca Collings
    and in order to take into account that evidence, it was clear  for  the
    evidence to be categorised as "invalid" on the spreadsheet provided  to
    the  Home  Office  the  case  had  to  have  gone  through  a  computer
    programming analysing speech and  then  to  two  independent  voicemail
    assistants.  The grounds submitted that in the light of the evidence it
    was clear that the Secretary of State had reasonably concluded that the
    Appellant had used deception in his application and that the First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law  in  finding  that  the  evidence  adequately
    demonstrated deception.

 6. On 26th July 2016 First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson granted  permission
    to appeal.  Judge  Simpson  noted  that  the  bundle  provided  by  the
    Immigration Officer was incomplete in that every other page was missing
    but it was arguable that the judge ought to have requested the complete
    document before proceeding to deal  with  the  appeal.   Judge  Simpson
    noted that the judge's decision was consistent with the recent case law
    in SM and Qadir v SSHD (ETS - evidence - burden of proof)  [2016]  UKUT
    00229 (IAC).  It was arguable that the judge had not  reached  adequate
    findings as to the contents of the Immigration Officer's interview with
    the Appellant at the airport in  which  the  Appellant's  answers  were
    "largely incoherent and often made little  or  no  sense".   In  short,
    Judge Simpson considered that it was arguable that the  Respondent  was
    entitled to refuse entry clearance under paragraph 321(A) in  light  of
    that additional evidence.  It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes
    before me to determine whether or not there is a material error of  law
    in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  For the  purpose  of
    continuity throughout the legal process, Mr Rafiq is referred to herein
    as the Appellant and the Secretary of State as the  Respondent,  albeit
    that this is an appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State.   The  Appellant
    appears  by  his  instructed  legal  representative  Mr  Khalids.   The
    Secretary of State appears by her Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  Ms
    Ahmad.

 7. In response to the grant of permission, a Rule  24  response  has  been
    served by the Appellant's legal representatives.  That Rule 24 response
    points out that the Appellant submitted his personal statement with the
    copies of qualification documents, providing that  he  studied  English
    language throughout his academic career and that therefore  he  had  an
    acceptable knowledge of  English.   It  refers  to  the  fact  that  he
    explained in his statement that he answered most of the questions asked
    by the Immigration  Officer  at  the  airport  and  for  those  he  had
    difficulty with he explained that he was tired after a long travel  and
    that the accent of the Immigration Officer was difficult to understand.
     The Appellant points out that the  Respondent  failed  to  provide  an
    audio record of the interview to the Tribunal in order that it could be
    assessed, and that the Secretary of State had  failed  to  provide  any
    evidence from the ETS  including  any  voice  recognition  record.   It
    therefore contended that in the light of the provided evidence from the
    parties, and any explanation given by the Appellant, that the Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to conclude  that  the  Respondent
    did not discharge the burden  of  proof  and  that  the  Appellant  had
    provided sufficient documentary evidence to prove his English  language
    skills including the explanation to the event during the  interview  at
    the airport.

Submissions/Discussions

 8. Ms Ahmad points out the failure of a full documentary transcript to  be
    provided due to a photocopying error as to the papers that were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  She draws my attention to the  decision
    of the President in MM (unfairness; E &  R)  Sudan  [2014]  UKUT  00105
    (IAC) and the  principle  of  law  that  a  successful  appeal  is  not
    dependent on the demonstration of some failing on the part of the First-
    tier Tribunal.  Thus, an error of law may be found to have occurred  in
    circumstances where some material evidence, through  no  fault  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, was not considered with resulting unfairness.  She
    submits that  that  is  the  position  here  and  that  the  judge  was
    considering interview notes with missing pages.  She submits  it  would
    have been fair and just for the judge to have adjourned the hearing  so
    that the material evidence could be  provided.   She  further  contends
    that the finding of Judge Simpson in granting permission  (albeit  that
    she acknowledges that permission was granted in favour of the Secretary
    of State), by making reference to the fact that  the  judge's  decision
    was consistent with the recent case law of SM  and  Qadir  is  in  fact
    wrong in that the evidential burden had been improperly  considered  in
    that the evidence had not been considered on the basis of  the  missing
    pages.  She asked me to find a material error of law in the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's decision.

 9. Mr Khalids starts by pointing out that there  are  two  general  issues
    that need to be considered.  Firstly is the enquiry carried out by  the
    Immigration Officer at the airport, and secondly, consideration of  the
    generic documentation in particular the  witness  statements  of  Peter
    Millington and Rebecca  Collings.   He  points  out  that  reading  the
    Grounds of Appeal there appears to be no disagreement by the  Secretary
    of State with regard to the enquiry that took  place  at  the  airport,
    i.e. whatever happened at the airport, that decision is not  challenged
    and that is a key point.

10. He points out that it was open to  the  judge  to  have  requested  the
    missing documents and there is a duty on the  parties  to  produce  the
    evidence upon which they intend to rely.  He refers me in  some  detail
    to the judge's consideration of the factual history of this matter  set
    out at paragraphs 19 to 22 of her decision.

11. He submits that the principles quite properly expounded within  MM  are
    completely distinguishable and that MM needs to be  considered  on  its
    own facts where the documents were  provided  through  solicitors.   He
    takes me in detail to paragraph 12 of the decision in MM which sets out
    the factual matrix of that case which concentrated on  the  Appellant's
    solicitors not writing to the Home Office to point  out  a  significant
    error in the Appellant's interview record which damaged the credibility
    of her claim.  He contends that that is  substantially  different  from
    the current case.  The Respondent has, he submits,  clearly  failed  to
    provide sufficient evidence and  as  the  judge  has  referred  to  the
    missing pages he contends that she was consequently aware of  what  was
    missing and therefore it is wrong to rely on MM as being supportive  to
    the Respondent's appeal.

12. He emphasises that a full bundle  of  documents  was  provided  by  the
    Appellant including a witness statement, skeleton argument and language
    certificate and  that  all  these  factors  including  the  Appellant's
    academic history are noted and recited by the judge at paragraph 11  of
    her decision.  He emphasises that the Appellant has invested �60,000 in
    a grocery and meat business  and  that  he  had  merely  gone  home  to
    Pakistan for a visit.  He asked me to dismiss the appeal.

13. In brief response, Ms Ahmad points out that permission was not  limited
    and that the judge did raise additional grounds and submits that  there
    was evidential material that was not considered by the judge which  she
    submits is extremely relevant and creates  a  procedural  defect.   She
    consequently contends the decision is  not  sustainable.   In  a  short
    response Mr Khalids points out that the pages missing appear merely  to
    address generic issues and reminds me that under paragraph 321(A) it is
    necessary for a deception to be shown.

The Law

14.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

15. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

16. This is one of a number of cases that has been before the  Tribunal  in
    recent times where it is contended that deception was  used  in  taking
    the English language  test  by  an  Appellant.   There  is  very  clear
    guidance as to where the burden of proof lies and on the evidence  that
    needs to be relied upon by the Secretary of State.  It  is  unfortunate
    that this case was dealt with on the papers.   I  acknowledge  that  in
    cases of this instance it is usually far better  if  they  are  not  so
    addressed and that oral testimony can  be  provided  if  for  no  other
    reason so as to enable the judge to make an assessment as to whether or
    not the Appellant can or cannot speak English.  I acknowledge that that
    in itself may not have been definitive so  far  as  the  allegation  is
    concerned.  In this instant case I have spoken to the Appellant and  he
    clearly speaks good English and understands questions that are  put  to
    him.  Further, his immigration  history  is  not  challenged.   He  has
    invested considerable sums in  a  grocery  and  meat  business  and  is
    hopeful to make further investment and to open  at  least  one  further
    retail outlet.

17. The Grounds of Appeal are almost generic in nature.  They fail  in  any
    shape or form to identify or to refer to the failure of  the  Secretary
    of State to produce full copies of the documentary evidence upon  which
    they rely.  In addition, the  judge  has  noted  the  history  of  this
    matter.  It is difficult to be anything other than highly  critical  of
    the administrative manner in which the Respondent  has  conducted  this
    case.  The history is set out at paragraphs 19 to 22 of the  First-tier
    Judge's decision.  It is clear that on more than one occasion documents
    were requested and the judge has noted at  paragraph  22,  firstly  the
    missing pages from the generic witness  statements  and  secondly,  and
    importantly, that the Appellant has served a full copy  of  the  bundle
    with his Notice and Grounds of Appeal.

18. I am satisfied that the judge was fully familiar with the evidence that
    she needed to be in order to draw her conclusions and properly  applied
    the correct burden of proof.  Whilst it is not raised in the Grounds of
    Appeal, I agree with the contentions made by Mr  Khalids  firstly  that
    whilst clearly the decision in MM is good law the facts  of  that  case
    are completely different and I am satisfied that there is no procedural
    unfairness created so as to constitute a material error of law.

19. This is a decision that whilst as mentioned above would best have  been
    dealt with  by  way  of  an  oral  hearing  has  been  very  thoroughly
    considered by the judge on the papers.  She  has  considered  the  full
    history and the burden of proof.  She has gone on  to  note  thoroughly
    the Appellant's case and his qualifications and his assertions as to an
    explanation as to why he may have had difficulty in answering questions
    and has noted the continuing failure  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    produce a copy of the audio recording of  the  interview.   Thereafter,
    she has gone on to consider the relevant case law and the evidence  and
    in particular the questions where it is contended that the  Appellant's
    answers were questionable.  Thereafter, the judge has gone on  to  give
    due consideration of the generic documentation.

20. Mr Khalids is correct in his submission that there is  no  disagreement
    by the Secretary of State with regard to  the  enquiries  made  at  the
    airport.  The contentions put have, for the purpose of fairness and  in
    particular bearing in mind that the initial hearing was on the  papers,
    gone considerably beyond the Grounds of Appeal.  Despite that,  and  on
    giving full consideration to the approach taken, I am satisfied for all
    the reasons given above that the decision is  sound  and  thorough  and
    discloses no material error of law.  The findings are  ones  the  judge
    was entitled to make and consequently the appeal is dismissed  and  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge is maintained.
