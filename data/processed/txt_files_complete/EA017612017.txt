For the Appellant:     Ms Malhotra, Counsel instructed by Capital
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nepal born on the 14th  July  1988.  She
    appeals with permission the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
    JHL Shepherd) to dismiss her appeal  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ('the Regs').







    The Appeal in the First-tier Tribunal

 2. The matter in issue before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  whether  the
    Appellant's marriage to her Portuguese husband Mr Paulo Freitas  Soares
    was one of convenience. If it was, then it was common ground  that  the
    appeal fell to be dismissed. If it wasn't,  or  rather  the  Respondent
    could not prove that it was, then the appeal fell to be allowed on  the
    basis that the Appellant was the  family  member  of  an  EEA  national
    exercising treaty rights, and so entitled to a recognition of her right
    of residence under the Regs.

 3. The Appellant did not appear before the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  give
    evidence, having elected to return to Nepal in  order  to  get  out  of
    immigration detention.  The Tribunal nevertheless  had  before  it  the
    following competing  evidence.  The  Appellant  relied  upon  the  live
    testimony of her husband, and two  additional  witnesses,  who  averred
    that they knew the couple  and  believed  them  to  be  genuine.    She
    further  produced  money  transfer  orders  showing  Mr  Soares  to  be
    supporting her financially,  transcripts of online text and video chats
    between the two of them, photographs, and evidence of  cohabitation  in
    London consisting of the tenancy agreement on the property  the  couple
    claimed to share, and utility bills etc. The Appellant herself provided
    a sworn witness statement. For the  Respondent  the  Presenting  Office
    relied upon a transcript of a 'marriage interview' which took place  on
    the 9th February 2017.   This  transcript,  submitted  the  Respondent,
    revealed that the parties to this marriage gave  inconsistent  evidence
    on key matters, and were ignorant of important facts about each  other,
    such that it revealed this marriage to be a sham.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal  found  that  the  interview  record  contained
    sufficient discrepancies for the initial  evidential  burden  upon  the
    Respondent  to  be  discharged.  Having  heard  the  evidence  for  the
    Appellant it was  not  satisfied  that  the  suspicion  raised  by  the
    Respondent had been allayed. It dismissed the appeal on the ground that
    the marriage was one in which  the  predominant  purpose  had  been  to
    secure an immigration advantage for the Appellant. For good measure  it
    added that the Sponsor had given evidence that he had not been  working
    "for some considerable period of time" and so was, in  any  event,  not
    exercising treaty rights.




    The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 5. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  PJM
    Hollingworth on the 13th March 2019.

 6. When the matter came before me on  the  14th  May  2019  the  Appellant
    advanced the following grounds:

          i) The Tribunal erred in fact/took immaterial considerations into
             account when it stated that the Appellant's witness  statement
             was not certified as properly translated, because  it  wasn't:
             the Appellant speaks fluent English.

         ii) The Tribunal erred in fact/took immaterial considerations into
             account when it drew adverse inference  from  the  Appellant's
             failure to arrange a video link to enable her to give evidence
             at the hearing.

        iii) There was a procedural  unfairness/disadvantage  in  that  the
             sponsor Mr Soares was at no stages in  this  process  provided
             with an  interpreter  in  his  native  -  and  only  fluent  -
             language, Tetum. Mr Soares  originates  from  East  Timor  and
             although he speaks some  English  and  Portuguese,  he  speaks
             neither language well enough  to  give  evidence  in  it.  The
             interpreter he had at the Home Office interview,  and  at  the
             hearing, was an Indonesian speaker. Indonesian and Tetum  have
             commonalities but are distinct languages.  This was a material
             factor that the Tribunal should have considered in  the  round
             when deciding  what  weight  to  place  on  the  discrepancies
             arising in his evidence. It gave rise to material inaccuracies
             in the evidence, an example being the Tribunal's understanding
             that Mr Soares said he was not working.  Mr  Soares  has  been
             working at all material times and in fact there  are  payslips
             and P60s in the bundle to demonstrate that this is the case.

 7. The Respondent opposed the appeal on all grounds.

 8. By my written decision of the 24th June 2019 I dismissed the appeal  on
    grounds (i) and (ii) but upheld ground (iii).

 9. In respect of ground (i) I found no material error  in  the  Tribunal's
    commentary  at  its  �23  that  the  Appellant's  statement   was   not
    accompanied by a certified translation. Whilst I accept it was an error
    of fact, and that she gave her statement in English, it does not appear
    that any adverse inference was in fact drawn from the point.

10. Similarly ground (ii) identifies  an  error,  but  not  one  such  that
    justifies any interference with the First-tier Tribunal decision.   The
    First-tier Tribunal recorded that the Appellant had returned  to  Nepal
    and could not therefore give live evidence in her  appeal.  It  records
    that her representative on the day, a Mr Kumar, had made no submissions
    to the  effect  that  she  had  somehow  thereby  been  the  victim  of
    unfairness. The Tribunal agreed with Counsel for the Home  Office  that
    the Appellant could have chosen to  give  evidence  via  skype  if  she
    wished to. Reliance is placed on the Family  Division  decision  in  ML
    (Use of Skype) [2013] EWHC 2019.  The Appellant takes issue  with  this
    comment, not least because the use of media  such  as  Skype  has  been
    deprecated in this jurisdiction: R (Mohibullah) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department (TOEIC-ETS-judicial review  principles)  [2016]
    UKUT 00561 (IAC).  Whilst  that  is  true,  I  am  not  satisfied  that
    anything turns on that. The fact is that this was an appeal  under  the
    EEA Regs and that the  Appellant  could  therefore  have  sought  entry
    clearance in order to give live evidence had she so wished. Nor does it
    appear that the Tribunal in fact weighed her absence against her.

11. Ground (iii) was not so straightforward.

12. Before the hearing had even begun the First-tier Tribunal  was  plainly
    aware that the ability of the Sponsor  to  understand  what  was  being
    asked of him, and to make himself understood,  had  already  become  an
    issue in the proceedings.  At �6  the  determination  records  that  an
    earlier hearing in the appeal, listed at Taylor House  in  April  2018,
    had to be abandoned because the Sponsor was  unable  to  give  evidence
    through the Indonesian  interpreter  provided  by  the  Court.  It  was
    decided nevertheless to proceed for a second time in the absence of the
    correct interpreter.

13. It then became clear during the hearing itself that there were  ongoing
    issues with the lack of a  Tetum  interpreter.   At  �29  the  Tribunal
    records Mr Soares stating, at "various points"  in  his  evidence  that
    there had been a misinterpretation of the evidence he had given at  the
    marriage interview, which had not  been  face  to  face  but  over  the
    telephone. It acknowledges that Mr Soares was raising his difficulty in
    understanding what was  being  said  to  him,  and  in  making  himself
    understood, at the centre of his evidence.  At  �33  the  determination
    records the concern raised at the hearing by a Mr Mavrantonis,  Counsel
    for the Respondent, who "asked for guidance from the bench as to how to
    structure questions given that, he submitted, Mr Soares did not  appear
    to understand". Finally, at �52, the Tribunal gives its  evaluation  of
    Mr Soares as a witness: "he either gave evasive answers or appeared not
    to understand the question put, and this was his  response  overall  to
    most questions put". It was for  these  reasons  that  the  appeal  was
    dismissed.

14. Responding to the Appellant's complaints about that, Senior  Presenting
    Officer Mr Melvin pointed out that it  was  Mr  Soares  who  wanted  to
    proceed with the hearing, ostensibly because he was keen for  his  wife
    to rejoin him. In the absence of any objection from either him  or  his
    representative on the day, the  Tribunal  could  do  nothing  else  but
    proceed on the footing that it did. Tetum is an obscure language in the
    United Kingdom, and it would seem that the IAC has now failed on  three
    occasions  to  find  a  registered  Tetum  interpreter  (one  was  also
    requested for the 'error of law' hearing). If one does  not  exist,  it
    would follow that Mr Soares would have to make do with what there  was,
    i.e. an Indonesian whom he could substantially understand.

15. I have checked with  the  Tribunal's  interpreter  service  and  I  can
    confirm that as far as they are  concerned,  there  are  no  registered
    Tetum interpreters working in the United Kingdom today.  Does that mean
    that Mr Melvin is correct and that Mr Soares had no option but to "make
    do with what he's got"?  Whilst that is a less than satisfactory  state
    of affairs it would seem that this was indeed the case.

16. That it was a less than satisfactory state of affairs does not  appear,
    however, to have been taken into account by the Judge. To the contrary,
    under the heading 'Findings and  Conclusions'  the  Tribunal  expressly
    weighs against Ms  Soares  the  fact  that  he  appeared  "evasive"  or
    "appeared  not  to  understand  the  question  put".  It  rejects   his
    contention that the lack  of  Tetum  interpreter  at  the  Home  Office
    interview led to inaccuracies in the evidence, whilst at the same  time
    inaccurately recording the evidence given before it,  i.e.  whether  Mr
    Soares  claimed  to  be  exercising  treaty  rights.    I  accept   the
    submission made on behalf of the Appellant that although  the  findings
    are detailed and reasoned, the  Tribunal  makes  no  reference  to,  or
    allowance for, the obvious defects in the way  that  the  evidence  was
    forthcoming.

17. This is a significant omission given the case  history.   The  Tribunal
    convened in April had already abandoned one hearing because  Mr  Soares
    could not make himself understood. In those circumstances all concerned
    with the second hearing should have proceeded with extreme  caution  in
    the way that this witness was questioned, and  the  way  in  which  his
    answers were understood.  That was particularly so where  his  evidence
    was put centre stage, in the absence of the Appellant  herself.  I  was
    therefore satisfied that  this  ground  was  made  out,  and  that  the
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal must be set aside.




    Disposal

18. For reasons I have already alluded to, it was not easy to  remake  this
    appeal. No fewer than four hearings followed the 'error of law' hearing
    in May, each an opportunity wasted as  the  parties  and  the  Tribunal
    tried to accommodate the Appellant and her case. By December it  became
    clear  that  the  Appellant  herself  was  not  going  to  be  able  to
    participate in person, an application for entry clearance  having  been
    refused and the logistics of securing a video link proving too  complex
    for her representatives to deal with. In the end the Appellant was able
    to voice her evidence through the production of what was described as a
    detailed witness statement. As for Mr Soares, there was no solution  to
    his interpreter conundrum and he too elected to give evidence by way of
    a witness statement only, which  I  am  told  (by  his  solicitor)  was
    prepared with the assistance  of  his  friend,  who  speaks  Tetum  and
    English. At the hearing on the 3rd December 2019  I  heard  submissions
    from Counsel and Mr Melvin and I reserved my decision.




    The Re-Made Decision

19. There is no burden of proof on the Appellant to prove that her marriage
    is genuine.  Where however there is evidence  justifying  a  reasonable
    suspicion that the marriage has been entered into for  the  predominant
    purpose of securing residence rights, there is an evidential burden  on
    the Appellant to show that her marriage is not one of convenience.  The
    final burden of proof rests with the Secretary of State: see Papajorgji
    (EEA spouse - marriage of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038  (IAC),
    Sadovska v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 54.

20. In this case the Secretary of State  submits  that  there  is  evidence
    justifying her reasonable suspicion that this marriage has been entered
    into for the predominant purpose of securing the Appellant  the  status
    of 'family member'  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 and thus an immigration advantage.  The  Secretary  of
    State's evidence is in the main drawn from the  answers  given  by  the
    Appellant and Mr Soares at an interview conducted on the  9th  February
    2017.   Each party was asked a  series  of  questions  related  to  the
    marriage, and each other.  In  a  letter  written  that  same  day  the
    Secretary of State identifies a series of discrepancies which she  says
    arose from the interviews.

21. I have divided those allegedly discrepant answers into three groups. In
    the first  I  place  the  matters  which  I  regard  as  warranting  an
    explanation by the Appellant and/or Mr Soares. In the  second  I  place
    those  matters  which  do  reveal  inconsistencies,  but  which   could
    reasonably result from an innocent lack of knowledge on the part of the
    other person. The third group do not seem to me to reveal discrepancies
    at all, or if they do they are inconsistencies which could easily arise
    in any marriage, or in any interview.

22. In the first group I place  the  following  problematic  questions  and
    answers:

          i) The Appellant stated that she has no brothers and  5  sisters;
             he thought that she only had one of each.

         ii) The Appellant said that they did not have a wedding  cake;  Mr
             Soares said that they did have one, which was square with pink
             icing.

        iii) The Appellant said that they had  gone  to  Nandos  for  their
             wedding meal; he said that they went to a Nepalese restaurant.

         iv) The Appellant said that their home  has  two  windows  in  the
             front; Mr Soares says that there are six.

          v) She said that their bins are green and black; he thought  they
             were blue.

         vi) She described their kitchen floor as having  black  tiles;  he
             said it was "lino".

        vii) She said that their microwave is silver, he said it was black.

       viii) Asked what they had done  on  their  day  off  that  week  the
             Appellant had said that they got up between 10.30 and 11.00am,
             had bread and coffee for breakfast and gone  into  town  where
             they went to McDonalds; they had chicken curry for dinner.  Mr
             Soares gave a completely different account,  saying  they  had
             got up at 8.00am, eaten omelettes that  he  had  cooked,  then
             they had stayed in and did their laundry. He  said  that  they
             had eaten fried rice and noodles for dinner.

         ix) The Appellant said that her husband had given her a jumper for
             Christmas; he said that it was money.

          x) She did not know what brand of cigarettes he smokes.

         xi) She thought he liked to gamble; he denied that he does so.

23. The  second  group  of  answers  are  those  which  I  regard  as  true
    inconsistencies, but inconsistencies that  have  a  perfectly  rational
    explanation. For instance, the Appellant said  that  when  her  husband
    goes to work in a restaurant he wears casual clothes; he said  that  in
    the kitchen he wears a uniform.  This  could  easily  result  from  his
    dressing for work when he gets there. Similarly, I attach little weight
    to the fact that the Appellant thought her husband had had that job for
    9-10 months, when it fact it was only 7.  There was some discrepancy as
    to who had introduced the couple in Shepherds Bush: she said  that  the
    friend's name was Pinto [F], he had said that his name was  Pinto  [S].
    Having had regard to the witness statements I am satisfied  that  there
    is a reasonable explanation in that the  gentleman  is  known  by  both
    names.  The pair gave inconsistent evidence about the  terms  of  their
    tenancy agreement, but given that the agreement itself is produced, and
    there is no challenge that it is genuine, this apparently  arises  from
    simple ignorance of the details.  I am further satisfied that there  is
    an innocent explanation for the pair naming different people  as  their
    landlord: their flat is owned  and  let  by  a  couple  "Jeroslow"  and
    "Martha".  I attach no weight to the fact  that  the  couple  had  each
    given different examples of things that they have  discussed  in  their
    future: it is perfectly possible that they have discussed both.

24.  In the third group are matters picked out by the  Secretary  of  State
    which I regard as  adding  nothing  to  her  case.  There  is  no  real
    discrepancy between Mr Soares working as a  "kitchen  assistant"  or  a
    "bus boy", nor between the words "razor" and "electric shaver". Nor  do
    I find any  discrepancy  in  the  Appellant's  understanding  that  her
    husband gets 4 x �150 per month and his evidence that he receives  �600
    in one go.

25. For the purpose of this  appeal  I  am  therefore  only  interested  in
    whether the Appellant can offer an innocent explanation for the matters
    raised at 22 i) - xi) above, which I am satisfied can  rationally  give
    rise to the Secretary of State's suspicions that this is not a  genuine
    relationship. The discrepant answers given by the pair are  capable  of
    supporting the conclusion that a) there were in  fact  no  post-wedding
    celebrations, b) the couple do not know each other  well  and  c)  they
    were not living together as claimed.

26. The Appellant's rebuttal evidence consists of witness  statements  from
    herself and Mr Soares, additional witness statements  from  friends  Ms
    Mary [A] and  Ms  Chin  [S],  and  a  bundle  of  additional  documents
    including:  photographs of the two  together,  phone  cards,   greeting
    cards, money transfers, the tenancy agreement,  correspondence  placing
    them both at the same address and  print  outs  of  'whatspp'  messages
    between the two.

27. In respect of the documentary evidence I find  that  this  prima  facie
    indicates that  after  marriage  the  Appellant  and  Mr  Soares  lived
    together at the same property.  I accept that there is some evidence of
    intervening devotion such as whatsapp chats. I  have  therefore  placed
    some weight on this evidence.  Additional witnesses Mary [A]  and  Chin
    [S] both aver that this is, to the best of their knowledge and  belief,
    a genuine  relationship,  and  I  have  placed  some  weight  on  those
    statements, although I  must  bear  in  mind  that  this  evidence  was
    untested and so there is a limit that can be placed on the  statements.
    I note that Pinto [S], who appeared before the First-tier Tribunal, had
    further supported the account of the couple's first meeting etc.

28. The parties and their witnesses have given wholly  consistent  evidence
    about how they met. They were introduced by  mutual  friends  Mary  and
    Pinto in Westgate shopping centre near Shepherds Bush.  They  all  went
    for a Chinese and  the  two  got  talking  and  got  along  well.  They
    subsequently chatted by text message, arranged to go on a date and  the
    rest is history. The account is supported before me by a statement from
    Mary [A]. The difficulty I have with the statements before me  is  that
    they are drafted in near identical terms, making it very  difficult  to
    imagine that they represent the actual words used by the deponent.  For
    instance, the Appellant, Mr Soares and Mary [A] all say of  that  first
    meeting "whilst talking the time ran so quick that was around one  hour
    had passed"; the Appellant and Mr Soares both state "it  felt  like  we
    know each other for long time within a week".  This limits  the  weight
    that I can place on the statements because  they  have  obviously  been
    drafted by the same person who simply repeated the account of the first
    deponent and asked the others to sign.

29. The parties claim to have been introduced on the 8th February 2016, and
    state that by Valentine's Day, the 14th  of  February,  Mr  Soares  had
    proposed. I appreciate that there is such a  thing  as  love  at  first
    sight; I also accept that people from different cultures have different
    approaches to marriage and that there is nothing inherently  suspicious
    about a marriage appearing to have been 'arranged' by friends Mary  and
    Pinto. I do not however consider it likely  that  two  people  with  no
    prior connection (i.e.  by  family  or  culture)  would  be  discussing
    marriage within a week of first meeting.   The  speed  with  which  the
    arrangement was made is a matter that weighs against the couple.

30. By April 2016 it is said that the pair were  living  together,  in  the
    Appellant's  rented  room  in  Ipswich.   There,  they   claim,   their
    relationship grew "deeper and deeper". It is  against  this  background
    that I must assess the answers that they gave an  interview,  some  ten
    months later, in February 2017.

31. A good number of the issues  that  arose  at  interview  concerned  the
    parties' respective knowledge about their home.   The two did not agree
    about how many windows  their  house  had,  the  colour  of  the  bins,
    microwave or kitchen floor.   I accept that not everyone pays attention
    to such details.    That  was  not  however  the  explanation  that  is
    offered. I am sorry to say that the explanations given in  the  witness
    statements made very little sense to me.

32. Of the number of windows the Appellant says this:

         "In total there are six windows. 2 can  be  seen  from  the  front.
         Husband confirmed that there  are  6  in  total:  2  inside  and  4
         outside. My husband was asked how many windows  in  the  house.  He
         answered six, which is absolutely right"

    I do not understand how some windows can appear  on  the  "inside"  and
    some on the "outside". This was left unexplained.

33. Similarly, the Appellant's explanation given as to how he came  to  say
    the words "lino/vinyl" instead of "black tiles" is incomprehensible:

         "The kitchen floor is black. Husband said it is  black  colour.  He
         doesn't know what lino/vinyl is.  Translated  into  Portuguese  the
         words are the same, and husband doesn't know words".

34. Of the microwave's colour Mr  Soares  is  said  to  have  confused  the
    microwave at home with his microwave at work, which seems on  its  face
    unlikely. In respect of the bins the Appellant conveniently elides  the
    various answers given by herself and her husband by  saying  that  they
    have bins of all of these colours.

35. In respect of the personal questions, relating to  their  knowledge  of
    each other and the time they had spent together, the evidence  is  also
    difficult to follow. Asked to explain why the two had given  completely
    different accounts of their day on the Monday before the interview  the
    Appellant says this:

         "Normally we waked up late on day offs. We waked up around 11am  on
         day offs and when he had work they he waked up at 8.00am  for  work
         ...

         Paulo said he made omelette, tomato and  bread  with  coffee.  This
         cannot be for every day or every Mondays. Different  one  on  every
         Monday so cannot remember".

    No explanation is offered as to whether they ate curry or  noodles  for
    dinner, nor whether they went to McDonalds in town during  the  day  or
    actually stayed at home to do their laundry.  The Appellant's inability
    to give a plausible response to these matters weighs against her.

36. I am  not  satisfied  that  the  parties'  respective  and  contrasting
    responses about their wedding day can  now  be  reconciled.  Mr  Soares
    stated that their wedding cake was square with pink icing on  it.  Even
    allowing for the difficulties he had with translation  it  is  hard  to
    understand why he would have said this if in fact they had decided  not
    to get a cake because his wife does not like icing, the explanation she
    gives in her statement.  The simpler answer to "did you  have  a  cake"
    would have been "no".  Having given completely different answers  about
    where they ate their wedding meal and who paid for it the Appellant now
     states that they went to Nandos immediately after the ceremony, and to
    a Nepalese restaurant the next day: if that were the case I would  have
    expected this information to have been forthcoming at the interview.

37. Another fundamental difficulty with the interview was  that  Mr  Soares
    did not know how many siblings his wife had. The explanation offered is
    that he gave the correct details, but his answer was  mistranslated  by
    the Indonesian interpreter.   I have taken that into account, but I  do
    note that (despite my suggestion at case management stage) no  evidence
    has been offered as to how these most basic words - the numbers 0 to 5,
    'brother' and 'sister' - could have been misunderstood. For instance  I
    have not been provided with any expert evidence about whether the words
    "five sisters" are substantially different  in  Tetum  and  Indonesian.
    Such evidence would have enabled me to  place  greater  weight  on  the
    complaints raised about interpretation.

38. Overall  I  bear  in  mind  that  there  is  some  evidence  about  the
    relationship between these two people. They clearly  know  each  other,
    and I accept that they entered into a tenancy agreement together.  They
    may well have lived in the same house for a time.  I accept  that  they
    were introduced by Mary and Pinto and that this meeting may  well  have
    taken place in the Westgate shopping centre. As to the  motivation  for
    the marriage, I am on balance satisfied that a material part of it  was
    to secure an immigration advantage for the Appellant. The  decision  to
    marry was taken in great  haste  when  they  hardly  knew  each  other;
    although they had allegedly been living as husband and wife for  almost
    a year at the date of interview it was clear that  their  knowledge  of
    each other, and the marital home, was extremely  limited.  It  is  also
    clear from the interview that the claimed marriage celebrations did not
    take place as described.  I have given what weight I can  to  the  fact
    that Mr Soares has had real difficulty in securing  an  interpreter  in
    his mother tongue. I accept that this placed him - and the Appellant  -
    at a significant disadvantage. I also bear in mind that he has now  had
    two years to submit his witness statement, and that every  attempt  has
    been made to assist him in giving that evidence. The  reality  is  that
    the explanations offered, whether in writing or live  evidence,  simply
    do not offer a plausible answer to the very  substantial  discrepancies
    in the marriage interviews.
