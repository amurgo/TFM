Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs Z Kiss, HOPO
For the Respondent:    Mr V Makol


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge M R Oliver allowing the appeal of
    the respondent on family and private  life  grounds  under  Article  8,
    ECHR.

2.   The respondent will from now on be referred to  as  the  applicant  for
    ease of reference.

3.   The applicant is a national of Afghanistan born on 1 January 1975.   He
    claimed asylum on arrival in the UK on 19  September  2002;  after  his
    appeal against  the  refusal  was  dismissed  his  appeal  rights  were
    exhausted on 9 December 2003.  On 13 December 2011 he applied for leave
    to remain under Article 8 on the basis of his family and private  life.
    His application was initially refused on 23  November  2012  but  after
    protracted litigation in the judicial  review  application,  a  consent
    order was agreed on 29 March 2016, which resulted in a further refusal
    of 8 July 2016.

4.   In  the  refusal  letter  of  8  July  2016,  the  Secretary  of  State
    considered  the  application  under  Appendix  FM  in  respect  of  the
    appellant's family  life.   He  had  no  children  and  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to his family life with his partner continuing
    in Afghanistan.  In respect of his private life under paragraph  276ADE
    of the Rules, it was again argued that there would be no insurmountable
    obstacles to his integration back  into  Afghanistan.   There  were  no
    exceptional circumstances.

5.   The applicant's evidence can be summarised as follows -  he  had  left
    Afghanistan after his father had  been  brutally  killed.   His  father
    worked for the Government and the appellant's  family  was  at  serious
    risk of being killed themselves.  His uncle arranged for him  to  leave
    Afghanistan.  He accepted that his appeal rights had been exhausted  in
    2003.  He was scared to return because he knew that he would be killed.



6.   In 2009 he met his wife, [HK], a British  citizen.   He  disclosed  his
    lack of immigration status before entering into a serious  relationship
    with her.  They married on 16 December 2011.  After their marriage they
    had been living together at her rented accommodation with her son  from
    a previous relationship.  Because he did not work, his  wife  supported
    him from her full-time employment.  She also had another  son  and  her
    whole family were in the United Kingdom.  He claimed that she could not
    relocate to Afghanistan and had never been there.  She  was  now  being
    treated for the stress she was suffering from.

7.   He stated that before leaving Afghanistan he had lived all his life  in
    Kabul.  Although he still had family there, he was not in contact  with
    them.  His mother and brothers had been living there but moved to  stay
    with the uncle who had  helped  him  when  he  left.   Before  he  left
    Afghanistan, he worked as a tailor, making clothes for women.  His wife
    was not Afghani but Bengali by origin.

8.   He stated that his stepsons were now about 23 and 30  years  old.   The
    30-year old child was married.

9.   The applicant's wife [HK] gave evidence.  In her witness statement  she
    had said that her previous relationship ended in an Islamic divorce  in
    2009, followed by a  civil  divorce  in  2010.   She  corroborated  his
    account of the development of their relationship and the  efforts  they
    had made to regularise his immigration status.  She was scared for  his
    safety if he had to return to Afghanistan to make  an  application  but
    was confident that they could meet the requirements for his  settlement
    under the Rules.  She was earning more than �18,600 per month.  In oral
    evidence, she stated that her sons were  both  British  citizens.   The
    younger son would live with her and the applicant until he got married.
     He had an online business, while the older son was a  minicab  driver.
    Their father was a Bangladeshi man but did not live  in  the  UK.   Her
    brothers and sisters lived here.  She did  not  speak  Farsi.   If  her
    husband had to return to Afghanistan temporarily in order to apply  for
    settlement, she would not accompany him.

10.  The  judge  said  that  under  Appendix  FM,  the  respondent  has  not
    suggested that the applicant did not satisfy the suitability  criteria.
    Under the eligibility criteria, however, the appellant  is  present  in
    the UK without  leave  in  breach  of  immigration  law.   Furthermore,
    although his wife is British and her pay slips show that she has, since
    September 2017, been earning at an annual income of �18,600, only three
    pay slips have been provided and her employer's letter does  not  state
    her salary, the appellant has therefore not  provided  the  documentary
    evidence required under Appendix FM-SE.

11.   The  judge  accepted  the   genuineness   and   subsistence   of   the
    relationship.  The question  that  he  had  to  consider  therefore  is
    whether there are insurmountable obstacles to the  applicant  returning
    to Afghanistan, either to  continue  his  relationship  with  his  wife
    there, as the respondent has suggested, or make  an  application  while
    there.

12.  The judge held that the applicant's wife is culturally of Bengali,  not
    Afghan, background, but has in fact lived all of her life  in  the  UK,
    where she was born.  The judge accepted that she does not  speak  Farsi
    or Dari.  She has no family or friends in Afghanistan.  If  there  were
    no other reasons why  she  should  not  be  expected  to  continue  the
    relationship in Afghanistan, these would in his  judgment  suffice  and
    would  amount  to  insurmountable  obstacles  in  her   case   to   the
    relationship continuing there.

13.  The judge held that if the applicant had to return  to  Afghanistan  to
    make his application for settlement, he will be returned to Kabul,  but
    he has no family there and he has been  absent  from  the  country  for
    sixteen years.  Both the British  and  United  States  Government  have
    warned against travelling to Afghanistan because of the risks  usefully
    highlighted in the respondent's Country Policy and Information Note  in
    August 2017 with Kabul the location of most of the killings.

14.  The judge held that whether the  applicant  could  meet  the  financial
    requirements of settlement remains moot, so that the situation  is  not
    comparable with Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40, but  Appendix  FM  has
    now been revised to reflect the judgment in R (Agyarko) v  SSHD  [2017]
    UKSC 11 so that the application would not be  defeated  if  there  were
    "unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, the partner  or  a
    relevant child".  While the judge accepted that the family life  rights
    of the applicant's wife despite being British and of force (Beoku-Betts
    v SSHD  [2008]  UKHL  39),  are  qualified  by  her  knowledge  of  the
    applicant's immigration status when she entered into a relationship, he
    nevertheless found that there would be insurmountable obstacles in  all
    the circumstances to  the  applicant  having  to  return  to  make  his
    application.

15.  The judge held that the consideration given by the Secretary  of  State
    to the exceptional circumstances of the case has been cursory  and  the
    respondent's suggestion that the respondent's wife  could  return  with
    him to Kabul is unsustainable.  Although  it  is  not  necessarily  the
    fault of the respondent that the application made in 2011 has taken  so
    long to resolve, it necessarily follows that the relationship which the
    appellant has with a British  citizen  has  inevitably  grown  stronger
    during that period and the consideration to  be  given  to  her  family
    rights have grown stronger.

16.  In all the circumstances the judge found  that  there  are  exceptional
    circumstances requiring consideration outside the Rules.   Despite  his
    adverse immigration history, the judge held that the  applicant  has  a
    genuine and subsisting family life with his British partner, with which
    the refusal, which would necessitate his return to Kabul, would  be  an
    interference disproportionate to the public interest in the maintenance
    of a fair but firm immigration control.  In coming to this  conclusion,
    the judge took into account that there has been no suggestion that  the
    applicant has not in fact been adequately maintained by his wife.

17.  The grounds of appeal lodged  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    submitted that the judge has materially erred in law  by  allowing  the
    applicant's appeal  without  regard  to  the  public  interest  factors
    outlined in Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002.  The  grounds  listed  all  the  public  interest  considerations
    applicable in all  Article  8  cases.   Reliance  was  placed  on  Dube
    (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC) which held that judges are  duty
    bound to have regard to the specific considerations  at  Section  117A-
    117D.  Dube also held that it is not an error of law to fail  to  refer
    to ss.117A-117D considerations if the judge applied the test he or  she
    was  supposed  to  apply  according  to  its  terms;  what  matters  is
    substance, not form.  The grounds  asserted  that  the  judge  has  not
    applied the test he was supposed to apply when allowing the applicant's
    appeal either in substance or form.

18.  Permission was granted to the Secretary of State to appeal the  judge's
    decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes.  He said  as  follows  at
    paragraph 3 of his grant of permission

    3.   The grounds complain that the Judge failed to make  any  reference
         to ss117A-177D of the 2002 Act. There is no  express  reference  to
         these provisions, and it is certainly arguable that the  Judge  has
         possibly confused the position of a relationship with a  qualifying
         child under s117B(6) with a relationship with a qualifying partner.
          Here there was no qualifying child. The Appellant did not meet the
         requirements of Appendix FM or FM-SE at the date of the hearing. It
         was not impossible that he would be able to do so  in  the  future,
         since it was claimed the sponsor had now obtained  employment  with
         the requisite salary, but it could not be said that a  hypothetical
         application for entry clearance made at the  date  of  the  hearing
         would be bound to succeed.  Thus  it  is  well  arguable  that  the
         Judge's approach to  the  Chikwamba  principle  was  confused,  and
         wrong, in the light of MM [2017] UKSC10, and Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11
         and the Appellant's immigration history; even if  he  accepted  the
         sponsor's evidence that she would not travel to  Kabul.   Moreover,
         his approach to the ability of the Appellant to travel to Kabul  in
         safety arguably failed to take account  of  either  AS  (safety  of
         Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT 118, or  indeed  earlier  country
         guidance on that issue.

19.  Mrs Kiss was given a copy of the  Rule  24  response  submitted  by  Mr
    Makol on behalf of the applicant.

20.  Mrs Kiss said she was relying on Agyarko  [2017]  UKSC  11.   She  said
    that at paragraph 43 the Supreme Court applied a stringent test to  the
    words "insurmountable obstacles",  that  is  obstacles  which  make  it
    literally impossible for the family to live together in the country  of
    origin of the non-national concerned.  At  paragraph  54  it  was  held
    "where confronted with a fait accompli the removal of the  non-national
    family member by the Authorities would be incompatible with  Article  8
    only in exceptional circumstances"  "(Jeunesse,  paragraph  114)".   At
    paragraph 60 it was held that ... "the  word  exceptional"  as  already
    explained, as meaning "circumstances in which refusal would  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences  for  the  individual  such  that  the
    refusal of the application would not be proportionate".   At  paragraph
    68 the Supreme Court held that the  entitlement  conferred  by  Section
    1(1) of the 1971 Act does not entitle the  British  citizen  to  insist
    that his or her non-national partner should also be entitled to live in
    the UK, when that partner may lawfully be refused  leave  to  enter  or
    remain.

21.  Mrs Kiss submitted that in the Rule 24 response it was argued that  the
    judge did cover Section 117B in essence.  Mrs Kiss said when the couple
    met the appellant was here illegally having failed to obtain  leave  to
    remain.  The judge had a copy of the First-tier  Judge's  decision  but
    did not refer to it at all.  The applicant had absconded for  a  number
    of years and his status was precarious and the wife knew  that  he  was
    without status.  The judge failed to consider 117B(iv) which says  that
    little weight should be given to  a  private  life  or  a  relationship
    formed with a qualifying partner that is established by a person  at  a
    time when the person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

22.  Mrs Kiss said the judge gave weight to the fact  that  the  applicant's
    spouse is not able to speak his language.  She submitted that  this  is
    not an insurmountable obstacle.

23.  Mrs Kiss submitted that with regard to return to Kabul,  the  grant  of
    permission stated that the judge failed to mention AS.  She  said  that
    the appellant is fit and well.  He has been in  the  UK  illegally  for
    sixteen years and was not a child when he  came  here.   He  spent  his
    formative years in  Afghanistan  and  has  been  quite  resourceful  in
    finding his way to the UK.

24.  Mrs Kiss said the judge looked briefly at  Chikwamba  and  Agyarko  and
    found that the  appellant's  removal  would  have  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences.  She said there was no relevant child in this case.  Both
    stepsons are adults.

25.  She said the judge noted that the delay in this  case  was  not  solely
    due to the Secretary of State but due  to  protracted  judicial  review
    proceedings.

26.  Responding to the Rule 24 response that  there  are  no  facilities  in
    Afghanistan for the applicant to obtain entry clearance, Mrs Kiss  said
    the appellant can go to Islamabad to obtain entry clearance in light of
    his resourcefulness in coming to  the  UK  illegally.   Therefore,  the
    assertion that the judge has looked at all matters in Section 117B does
    not apply.

27.  With regard to the application of Chikwamba, Mrs  Kiss  submitted  that
    in the evidence submitted by the applicant, it was said that the wife's
    gross salary on 31 March 2017 was �11,932 for the  tax  year.   It  has
    been asserted that her salary has increased, yet at  page  68  it  said
    that  she  was  earning  �1,550  on  30  September  2017  but  in   the
    corresponding bank balance only �950 was paid into  the  bank  account.
    Mrs Kiss said this throws doubt on the financial evidence.

28.  She said that the applicant's knowledge of the English  language  is  a
    neutral factor and not a positive factor.

29.  Mr Makol's submitted that the Secretary of State's grounds raised  only
    one argument and it was that the judge failed to  apply  Section  117B.
    Permission was granted on that point.  Mr Makol accepted that there was
    no mention of Section 117B by the judge.  Mr. Makol relied  on  Dube  -
    also relied on by the Secretary of State - to submit that it is not an
    error of law to fail to refer to Section  117A-117D  considerations  if
    the judge has applied  the  test  he  or  she  was  supposed  to  apply
    according to its terms, what matters is substance, not form.

30.  I find that the judge's failure to mention Section 117B did  give  rise
    to an error of law.  I find that the judge failed to properly  consider
    that little weight should be given to the applicant's private life  and
    the relationship he had formed with  his  wife,  who  is  a  qualifying
    partner, at a time when his immigration status was precarious.  I  find
    that the judge gave cursory consideration to these matters;  rather  he
    placed more weight on his finding that the  marriage  was  genuine  and
    subsisting and the difficulties they would face if they had  to  return
    to Afghanistan together.

31.  I accept the assertion in  the  grant  of  permission  that  the  judge
    confused the position of a relationship with a qualifying  child  under
    Section 117B(6) with a relationship with a qualifying  partner.   Here,
    there  is  no  qualifying  child.   The  applicant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM or FMSE at the date of the hearing.  It was
    not impossible that he would be able to do so in the future,  since  it
    was claimed that the sponsor  had  now  obtained  employment  with  the
    requisite salary,  but  it  could  not  be  said  that  a  hypothetical
    application for entry clearance made at the date of the  hearing  would
    be bound to succeed.  Especially, in view of the anomaly highlighted by
    Mrs Kiss between the spouse's salary and the amount paid into her  bank
    account.

32.  I also find that the judge's approach to the  Chikwamba  principle  was
    confused, and wrong, in the light of MM [2017] UKSC 10, and Agyarko and
    the applicant's immigration history, even if he accepted the  sponsor's
    evidence that she would not travel to Kabul.

33.  Mr Makol sought to argue that Judge Holmes  relied  on  AS  (Safety  of
    Kabul) about travelling to Afghanistan.  He said in the context  of  an
    entry  clearance  application  this  was  an  incorrect  consideration.
    Instead, Judge Holmes should have reminded himself of the  case  of  SM
    and others (Entry Clearance - proportionality) Afghanistan  CG  [2007]
    UKAIT 00010 which despite being a decade old still holds true.  He said
    SM found that


         "There are no facilities  for  Afghan  nationals  to  obtain  entry
         clearance from Afghanistan  or  elsewhere.   Where  an  application
         meets all the relevant requirements under the Immigration Rule  and
         but for the absence of entry clearance he  would  qualify  and  the
         respondent cannot show that it is practicable  for  him  to  obtain
         entry clearance, the claim may  succeed  under  Article  8  if  the
         applicant shows, or (as in this  case),  the  respondent  conceded,
         that entry clearance cannot in practice be obtained because of  the
         lack of accessible facilities".

34.  Mr Makol submitted that this should have been considered,  rather  than
    relocation to Kabul because there are no entry clearance facilities  in
    Kabul and therefore the separation will not be quick as the Immigration
    Judge seems to think.  He said Judge Holmes failed to consider that  in
    the balancing exercise there has been a delay of five years whereby the
    private and family life of  the  couple  has  grown,  which  the  judge
    considered as a relevant factor.

35.  I was not persuaded by Mr Makol's arguments. The applicant has been  in
    the UK illegally for sixteen years. He formed  his  relationship  at  a
    time when he was here illegally.  The five-year delay  formed  part  of
    the illegal stay.   AS is about travelling to Afghanistan and safety in
    Kabuul.  SM is about making an entry clearance application  to  join  a
    spouse in the UK.  In this case it is the  Secretary  of  State's  case
    that the applicant  can  relocate  with  his  wife  to  Afghanistan  or
    alternatively  return  to  Afghanistan  to  make  an  entry   clearance
    application.  There was  no  concession  by  the  respondent  that  the
    applicant's entry clearance application was bound to succeed.

36.  For the above reasons I find that the judge erred in law and  that  the
    judge's decision cannot stand.

37.  I find that in the light of the  evidence  before  me,  I  am  able  to
    determine this appeal.

38.  Mr Makol in his  Rule  24  response  did  not  challenge  Judge  Holmes
    assertion in the grant of permission that the applicant  did  not  meet
    the requirements of Appendix FM or FM-SE at the date  of  the  hearing.
    Therefore, this case requires consideration of  the  Article  8  public
    interest considerations in s117B when carrying out the  proportionality
    balance.

39.  I accept that the applicant speaks English, having given  his  evidence
    in English.  I find that this is a  neutral  factor  in  the  balancing
    exercise.  He is financially dependent on his wife  and  therefore  not
    financially independent himself.

40.  The applicant has no evidence of legal  entry  in  the  UK.   Following
    dismissal of his asylum claim, his appeal rights  became  exhausted  in
    December 2003.  The applicant absconded and re-surfaced in 2011 to make
    an application for leave to remain following his marriage to his  wife.
    He therefore entered into the relationship with his wife at a time when
    his immigration status was precarious.   His  wife  was  aware  of  his
    immigration status at the time of their relationship. It  follows  that
    there was no expectation that he would be granted leave  to  remain  in
    the UK.   The five years that it took for the case to be  resolved  was
    found by the judge not to be the respondent's fault.

41.  I find that in this case the applicant has presented the  Secretary  of
    State with a fait accompli by virtue of  his  marriage  to  an  English
    national.  I accept that his wife cannot speak his language.   He  gave
    his evidence in English and so did she.  English is therefore a  common
    language between  them.   Her  inability  to  speak  Farsi  is  not  an
    exceptional circumstance as they are  able  to  communicate  with  each
    other in English.

42.  There are no young children in this case.   The  two  stepsons  of  the
    applicant are adults.  The son who is 23 years old and living  at  home
    is not dependent on the applicant in any way.  This case does not  come
    within the scope of Chikwamba.

43.  The applicant told the judge that before  leaving  Afghanistan  he  had
    lived all his life in Kabul.  He still had family therefore, though  he
    was not in contact with them.  His mothers and brothers moved  to  stay
    with the uncle  who  had  helped  him  when  he  left.   He  worked  in
    Afghanistan as a tailor making clothes  for  women.   I  find  on  this
    evidence that the applicant should not have difficulty  relocating  his
    family and re-integrating into life in Afghanistan.

44.  Applying the stringent test in Agyarko, I do not find on  the  evidence
    that the applicant's return to Afghanistan would lead to  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences.  His wife has a choice whether to accompany him  to
    Afghanistan or to remain in the UK whilst he makes  an  application  to
    join her here.

45.  She has expressed the wish to remain in the  UK  whilst  the  applicant
    returns to make an entry clearance application.  In his submissions, Mr
    Makol placed reliance on SM and others that there are no facilities for
    Afghan nationals to obtain entry clearance from Afghanistan.  I  accept
    Mrs Kiss's submission that as the applicant  has  been  resourceful  in
    finding his way to the UK, he can  go  to  Islamabad  to  obtain  entry
    clearance from there.

46.  I find that the maintenance of effective immigration control is in  the
    public interest.  The applicant's behaviour  in  remaining  in  the  UK
    illegally for sixteen years has to be seen in that context.  I  do  not
    find that the evidence reveals that there would  be  any  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences should he be required to leave the UK and return  to
    Afghanistan to live or alternatively return  to  Afghanistan  and  then
    make his way to Islamabad in Pakistan to make an application for  entry
    clearance to join his wife in the UK.

47.  I am not satisfied on balance that the  appellant's  Article  8  rights
    outweigh the public interest in immigration control.  I find  that  the
    Secretary of State's  decision  is  proportionate  on  public  interest
    grounds.

48.  The applicant's appeal is dismissed.
