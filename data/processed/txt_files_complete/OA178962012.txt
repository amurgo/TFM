For the Appellant:     Miss Rebecca Pickering instructed by David Gray,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Clive Dewison, Home Office Presenting Officer


It is, therefore, always necessary in  cases  involving  the  ability  of  a
parent to adequately maintain an appellant in an appeal under paragraph  297
to bear in mind that the maintenance  requirement  does  not  cease  on  the
child attaining the age  of  majority  and,  depending  on  the  appellant's
personal circumstances, it may continue for sometime beyond  an  appellant's
eighteenth birthday and that as the Tribunal  is  concerned  only  with  the
circumstances appertaining as at the date of the decision  under  challenge,
it is improbable that any evidence of the child's future potential  earnings
will be more than speculative and so unlikely to be capable of  being  taken
into account.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant  is  a  citizen  of  Bangladesh,  who  was  born  on  2nd
    November, 1984.  He made application to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    Dhaka, for leave to enter and settle in the United Kingdom as the child
    of parent settled there, under paragraph 297 of Statement of Changes in
    Immigration Rules, HC 395, as amended ("the Immigration Rules").

2.   The appellant is  the  son  of  Janu  Begum  ("the  sponsor")  who  has
    indefinite leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  respondent
    refused the appellant's application in a Notice of Decision  dated  9th
    August, 2012.

3.   The respondent refused the application, suggesting that  the  appellant
    had failed to meet the requirements of paragraph 297(i)(d) and  (e)  of
    the Immigration Rules, as well as failing to meet the  requirements  of
    paragraph 297(v).

4.   The appellant appealed and his appeal was heard by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Mozolowski, who, in a determination dated 22nd April, 2003, found
    that the appellant was the son of the sponsor.  She also accepted  that
    the appellant was under the  age  of  18  years  at  the  date  of  the
    application and currently lives with his oldest  married  sister.   She
    found that the appellant's father  was  dead  and  the  appellant  did,
    therefore, meet paragraph 297(i)(d) and (e).

5.   In relation to the requirements of paragraph 297(v),  the  judge  noted
    that appellant was required to be maintained adequately by  the  parent
    without recourse to public funds.  She found that the sponsor  was  not
    earning sufficient to maintain the  appellant,  because  she  was  only
    earning �100 a week.  That was below the relevant income support level.
     She noted that a job had  been  offered  to  the  appellant  by  a  Mr
    Choudhury, the owner of a company  running  several  restaurants.   The
    judge found that that job offer was not a genuine  offer,  because  she
    did not accept the evidence of Mr Choudhury that at material all  times
    there was always a low level job, such as being a dishwasher, available
    to the appellant.  Neither did she  accept  Mr  Choudhury's  contention
    that it was very difficult to fill such jobs  from  amongst  the  local
    population.  The judge dismissed the appeal.

6.   The grounds of appeal suggested that the judge  had  erred  in  law  by
    failing to take into account the sponsor's savings, amounting  to  some
    �3,800.  Reliance was placed on the decision  in  Jahangara  Begum  and
    Others (Maintenance - savings) Bangladesh [2012] UKUT 246 (IAC) for the
    proposition that any shortfall in income of the sponsor, could be  made
    up by any savings the sponsor had.  It was suggested that the judge had
    also erred in failing to take account of the  job  offer  made  to  the
    appellant and suggested that it was ultimately for Mr Choudhury who  he
    wished to employ in his business and his motivation, either  financial,
    or benevolent, were not relevant, so long as an offer of work genuinely
    existed for the appellant.

7.   Miss Pickering pointed out that at the date of the hearing  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge, the evidence showed that at the date of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision, the sponsor actually had savings of
    �3,400, rather than the �3800 suggested in the grounds of appeal.   The
    sponsor's earnings fell short of the relevant income support  level  at
    the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision by �53.39  per  week
    which meant, Miss Pickering submitted, that the sponsor's savings would
    be adequate to cover the shortfall in  appellant's  maintenance  for  a
    period of 71 weeks.

8.   Counsel urged me to note that although the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision was taken on 9th August, 2012, the  appellant  celebrated  his
    18th birthday on 2nd November, 2012.  She  suggested that the judge was
    also wrong in what she had said about the offer of  employment.   Third
    party support was, Miss Pickering suggested, available to the appellant
    and the issue for the judge was not whether the job  had  been  created
    for the sake of it, but rather  whether  an  offer  of  work  genuinely
    existed for the appellant.

9.   Mr Dewison asked me to find that the decision in Begum  did  not  apply
    to this appeal.  The decision in Begum had, he  pointed  out,  been  in
    relation to a marriage settlement appeal, where the grant of  the  visa
    was for a fixed, temporary period of two years.  Here, the grant is for
    indefinite leave.  What was to happen after the  period  of  71  weeks?
    How would that appellant then be maintained?  Mr Dewison submitted that
    it is not the case, as alluded to by counsel that it was only necessary
    for it to be shown that the appellant could  be  adequately  maintained
    until he was 18 years of age.  So far as the job  offer  is  concerned,
    the judge found that it was not a genuine offer in any event.

10.  Miss Pickering said that it was speculative as  to  what  might  happen
    once the sponsor's savings had been expended.  It was wrong to  assume,
    however, that the appellant would  seek  to  rely  on  the  State.  The
    appellant would, in any event, have been over the age of 18 long before
    the savings were expended on his maintenance and would no longer  be  a
    child.

11.  I reserved my decision.

12.  I do not believe that the  decision  of  the  Tribunal  in  Begum  does
    assist me. Paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules provides as follows:


         "Requirements for indefinite leave to enter the United  Kingdom  as
         the child of a parent, parents or a relative present and settled or
         being admitted for settlement in the United Kingdom

         297. The requirements to be met  by  a  person  seeking  indefinite
         leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents
         or a relative present and settled or being admitted for  settlement
         in the United Kingdom are that he:

             (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join  a  parent,
             parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:

                  (a) both parents are present and  settled  in  the  United
             Kingdom; or

                  (b) both parents are being admitted on the  same  occasion
             for settlement; or

                  (c) one parent  is  present  and  settled  in  the  United
                  Kingdom and the  other  is  being  admitted  on  the  same
                  occasion for settlement; or

                  (d) one parent  is  present  and  settled  in  the  United
                  Kingdom  or  being  admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
                  settlement and the other parent is dead; or

                  (e) one parent  is  present  and  settled  in  the  United
                  Kingdom  or  being  admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
                  settlement and has had sole responsibility for the child's
                  upbringing; or

                  (f) one parent or a relative is present and settled in the
                  United Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion  for
                  settlement and there are serious and compelling family  or
                  other considerations which make  exclusion  of  the  child
                  undesirable and suitable arrangements have been  made  for
                  the child's care; and

             (ii) is under the age of 18; and

             (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and  is
             not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent  family
             unit; and

             (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the  parent,
             parents or relative the  child  is  seeking  to  join  without
             recourse to public funds in accommodation  which  the  parent,
             parents or relative the child  is  seeking  to  join,  own  or
             occupy exclusively; and

             (v) can, and will, be maintained  adequately  by  the  parent,
             parents, or relative the child is  seeking  to  join,  without
             recourse to public funds; and

             (vi) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in
         this capacity; and

             (vii) does not fall for refusal under the general grounds  for
         refusal." [My emphasis]


13.  It is clear that paragraph 297 relates to children who  are  under  the
    age of 18 years.  Subparagraph (v) is also clear; it does not  preclude
    third party support (see Mahad [2009] UKSC 16). However,  the  scenario
    in this appeal is not that the appellant will be maintained by a  third
    party; rather that he will  be  maintaining  himself  through  his  own
    earnings.  That is not permitted by paragraph 297 (v).

14.  The sponsor's income at the  date  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision fell short of the income support level (the yardstick  minimum
    level of adequacy (see KA and Others (Adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan
    [2006] UKAIT 00065)) by �53.39 per week.  The evidence before the judge
    was that as at the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision,  the
    sponsor held some �3,400 in her bank account in the  form  of  savings.
    Given that the sponsor's income fell short of the income support  level
    by �53.39 per week, I find that the judge did err, by failing  to  take
    into account the fact that the appellant could be adequately maintained
    for in excess of 70 weeks if the sponsor were to utilise her savings.

15.  The question then  arises,  for  how  long  is  a  parent  expected  to
    adequately maintain the child under Paragraph 297?

16.  It was suggested by counsel that since the  Rule  is  itself  concerned
    with children, the obligation of the parent to adequately maintain  the
    child, must end with the child's maturity.  I do not believe  that  can
    be correct.

17.  It cannot have been the intention of Parliament that  a  parent  should
    adequately maintain a child only until the child becomes an adult,  any
    more than it can properly be said to be  the  case  that  a  parent  is
    required to demonstrate that they will be in a position to  maintain  a
    child into the child's adulthood, indefinitely.

18.  I believe, that given  the  child  is  being  admitted  for  indefinite
    leave, it is necessary to consider all the facts  and  the  appellant's
    circumstances and to decide what would be a reasonable time  to  expect
    the appellant's parent to need to be able to  adequately  maintain  the
    appellant.

19.  In the case of a child who is over the age where attendance  at  school
    is compulsory, it will be relevant to consider what  marketable  skills
    (if any) a child might have to offer to a prospective employee.   Given
    that there are, sadly, large numbers of graduates in the United Kingdom
    who are unable to obtain anything other than menial employment  in  the
    current economic climate, if they are able to obtain any employment  at
    all, someone who has no particular skills to offer  in  the  employment
    market may need to be supported for a longer period on their  admission
    to the United Kingdom, to enable them  to  attend  courses  to  acquire
    suitable skills, than someone who already has a trade or profession. An
    appellant who cannot speak any English is likely  to  be  at  an  added
    disadvantage and will need to be supported for a longer  time,  because
    it is more likely than not that in  order  to  acquire  the  skills  an
    employer will be looking for, they will at least have to learn to speak
    and understand English, even if they will not necessarily  need  to  be
    able to read and write English.

20.  In the case of a child under the age  where  attendance  at  school  is
    compulsory, it will still be necessary to consider all  the  facts  and
    the appellant's particular  circumstances.   The  appellant's  previous
    education, their language skills and ability  to  thrive  and  progress
    their education in school in the United Kingdom after  arrival  may  be
    relevant, as will the appellant's prospects of entering into further or
    higher education: the nearer a child is to approaching  the  age  where
    attendance at school  is  compulsory,  the  more  relevant  a  parent's
    ability to continue to maintain the appellant will become.

21.  It is, therefore, always necessary in cases involving the ability of  a
    parent to adequately maintain an appellant in an appeal under paragraph
    297 to bear in mind that the maintenance requirement does not cease  on
    the  child  attaining  the  age  of  majority  and,  depending  on  the
    appellant's personal circumstances, it may continue for sometime beyond
    an  appellant's  eighteenth  birthday  and  that  as  the  Tribunal  is
    concerned only with the circumstances appertaining as at  the  date  of
    the decision under challenge, it is improbable that any evidence of the
    child's future potential earnings will be more than speculative and  so
    unlikely to be capable of being taken into account.



22.  This appellant, as far as I am aware, has no  particular  skills  which
    he  can  offer  to  a  potential  employer.  According  to   his   visa
    application, he is  not  working  and  is  supported  by  the  sponsor.
    Counsel pointed out that  there  was  a  job  offer  available  to  the
    appellant.  The judge found that this was not a genuine offer,  but  in
    any event, paragraph  297(v)  does  not  permit  the  appellant  to  be
    maintained through his own earnings.

23.  I do not  know  whether  the  appellant  can  speak,  read,  write  and
    understand the English language, but the grounds of appeal suggest that
    he is illiterate.  While his visa application was completed in English,
    I do not know if he completed it himself, or if it was completed on his
    behalf. As at the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision, there
    was  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  appellant  had  any  readily
    marketable skills which he could offer to potential employers.  It  was
    reasonably foreseeable that it would be necessary for the appellant  to
    at least undergo some skills training  to  equip  him  for  employment.
    Bearing in mind that there  was  no  evidence  before  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge and no evidence submitted to me  to  indicate  that  the
    appellant can understand or speak English, quite apart from whether  he
    can read and write English, it seems to me to be reasonable  to  assume
    that the  sponsor  ought  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  that  she  can
    adequately maintain the appellant for a period of at least  two  years,
    to enable the appellant to have sufficient time to be able  to  acquire
    sufficient skills to enable him to find employment, such that he  would
    be able to maintain himself without the need for State support.

24.  The sponsor had  funds  adequate  to  make  up  the  shortfall  in  the
    difference between her earnings and the  income  support  level  for  a
    period of only 71 weeks. Bearing in mind that there is no  evidence  to
    suggest that the appellant can understand English, or  has  any  skills
    which he can  offer  to  a  prospective  employer,  apart  from  menial
    labouring, I believe  that  it  is  reasonable  for  the  appellant  to
    demonstrate that the sponsor will be able to  adequately  maintain  him
    for at least two years after his arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom.   I
    find, therefore, that the appellant fails to meet the  requirements  of
    paragraph 297(v).

25.  In making her decision First-tier Tribunal Judge Mozolowski erred on  a
    point of law law.  I do not set aside her decision because I have found
    that her error was not material and could not  possibly  have  affected
    the outcome of the appeal.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.
