For the Appellant:     Ms T Kabir, Thamina Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier  Tribunal  dismissing  their  appeals  against  the   respondent's
    decision on 10 June 2015 to refuse them leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom on family and private life grounds.

Background

 2. There is very little dispute  about  the  core  facts  in  this  appeal
    appellants are a mother and  daughter,  both  citizens  of  Bangladesh.
    They came to the United Kingdom in 2007 as dependants of the  principal
    appellant's husband, who was studying here (the  second  appellant  was
    only 1 year old then).  They last had leave  to  remain  in  2009.   In
    2012, the principal appellant and her husband had another daughter:  by
    that time, he was no longer studying, but was working without leave  in
    an Indian restaurant.

 3. The marriage ran into difficulty in 2012 after the birth of the younger
    child.  The principal appellant says her husband  had  an  affair.   He
    left his wife and two daughters, disconnecting his mobile telephone and
    ceasing all contact.  The principal appellant says she  does  not  know
    where he is now.  There are no divorce papers in the  bundle,  but  the
    principal appellant's evidence is that the separation is permanent.

 4. Before leaving, the husband asked a close family friend, Mr  Uddin,  to
    look after his wife and daughters 'as if they were his own'.  Mr  Uddin
    found them a cheap room (the principal appellant says it is  rent-free,
    but he says he paid a little for it) and the  principal  appellant  has
    worked as a maid for a woman who also lives in that building.  Mr Uddin
    says that he has assisted the family with small sums of money.

 5. His support for the family included providing a letter to accompany the
    second appellant's appeal, urging that she be  allowed  to  remain  and
    pursue her education in the United Kingdom.  Mr Uddin's letter makes no
    mention of any intention to stop supporting  these  appellants  in  the
    near future, or at all.  Mr Uddin gave his  email  address  and  mobile
    telephone number,  but  he  did  not  attend  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing.  It is the principal  appellant's  evidence  that  he  stopped
    supporting the family soon after the appeal was  issued,  and  cut  off
    contact with her.

 6. At the date of hearing, the two girls were respectively 10 and 4  years
    old.  Despite a statement to the contrary in her witness statement, the
    principal appellant accepted at  the  hearing  that  both  girls  speak
    English and Bengali.  As well as the assistance received from Mr Uddin,
    the family are integrated  into  the  Bangladeshi  community  here  and
    receive financial and emotional support  from  them,  and  from  family
    friends. The principal appellant  says  that  she  has  sold  her  gold
    jewellery since her husband left, for a total of  about  �1000.   There
    are no letters from community leaders or friends in the United Kingdom,
    apart from Mr Uddin.

 7. The principal appellant's evidence is that neither of her daughters can
    read and write Bengali yet.  Of course, the  4-year-old  would  not  be
    learning to read or  write  in  English  or  Bengali  before  beginning
    school, which she had not done at the  date  of  hearing.   The  second
    appellant produced letters from her primary school, confirming that she
    has done well and that her primary education is complete.   There  were
    no letters or other evidence that she had been  allocated  a  secondary
    school place.

 8. The principal appellant married an educated  man.   Her  own  level  of
    education and social background is unclear.  She still has her parents,
    a brother and a sister in Bangladesh.  Her siblings are  married,  with
    families of their own: her sister's husband works in  the  Middle  East
    and her sister is a housewife.  The principal appellant's evidence  was
    that her brother in Bangladesh worked doing clerical work  in  a  small
    company.  The principal appellant considered that she would  be  unable
    to be supported by them or to earn her living in Bangladesh.   She  did
    not want to return alone  to  Bangladesh.   There  are  no  letters  of
    support or witness evidence from the appellant's parents or siblings.

 9. The core of the principal appellant's case is that her daughters  would
    be educationally disadvantaged as she would not be able to send them to
    an English language 'medium school' in Bangladesh on her  return.   The
    appellant said that such a school would be beyond her financial  means,
    because she did not have sufficient qualifications to obtain  a  decent
    job in Bangladesh to pay for schooling, accommodation and so forth.

         "As  the  quality  of  education  in  Bangladesh  is  significantly
         different to the UK which my daughters are more used to ... I would
         obviously want my  daughters  to  carry  on  with  their  education
         however for this to happen bearing in mind their  lack  of  Bengali
         language this will be difficult.  I submit that it will  be  unfair
         and unreasonable to expect my children to delay or even stop  their
         education as a result of not being able to pay for  English  school
         tuition fees in Bangladesh."

10. The appellant  contends  that  she  will  be  destitute  on  return  to
    Bangladesh.  The bundle contains a number of documents about employment
    difficulties in Bangladesh, to which the  Judge  was  not  directed  in
    submissions at the hearing, as Ms Kabir accepted.

First-tier Tribunal decision

11. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  dismissed  the  appeals  of  both  the
    principal and second appellants.  He found as  a  fact,  based  on  the
    principal appellant's evidence, that after the claimed breakdown of the
    principal  appellant's  marriage,  these  appellants  and  the  younger
    daughter lived in the United Kingdom with the financial  and  emotional
    support of the Bangladeshi community.   The  Judge  did  not  find  the
    principal appellant to be a reliable witness: she had told  lies  about
    her children's linguistic ability,  and  he  considered  that  she  was
    prepared to fabricate elements of her account in order to remain in the
    United Kingdom.

12. The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted that the  principal  appellant's
    circumstances  engaged  paragraph  EX.1  of  the  Rules,  but  was  not
    satisfied that it was unreasonable to expect the second  appellant  and
    her younger  sister  to  return  to  Bangladesh,  of  which  they  were
    citizens, with the  principal  appellant,  their  mother.   The  second
    appellant had spent about 6 years in primary education and was not  yet
    at secondary school.  The Judge took account of the immersion  of  this
    family in the Bengali community in the United Kingdom, and of the stage
    reached in the second appellant's schooling.  He  considered  that  she
    was young enough and flexible enough to adapt to life in Bangladesh  on
    return. The Judge  also  considered  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  and  the
    private life of the second appellant.

13. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  considered  the  principal  appellant's
    evidence to be 'highly dubious' and  vague.   He  considered  that  she
    really wished to remain in the United Kingdom as an  economic  migrant.
    He had regard to section 117B(6) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 (as amended), accepting that the second appellant was a
    qualifying child under section 117D, but considered that, again, it was
    reasonable to expect the second appellant to return to Bangladesh  with
    her mother.  The younger child is not yet a qualifying child.

14. The Judge gave separate consideration to the children's section 55 best
    interests.   He  directed  himself  not  to  consider   the   principal
    appellant's mendacity about the  children's  linguistic  ability  as  a
    negative credibility factor in  the  second  appellant's  appeal.   The
    Judge did not place weight  on  the  overstaying  by  the  family  when
    considering the second appellant's appeal, although he did have  regard
    to that factor in relation to the principal appellant.  The  Tribunal's
    assessment of the second appellant's best interests, and those  of  her
    younger sister, is at [18]-[20].  The Judge was not satisfied that  any
    educational disadvantages which the second appellant  and  her  younger
    sister might experience on return were such as to outweigh  the  United
    Kingdom's right to control immigration.

15. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered that it was in the  children's
    best interests to remain with their mother, but that it  would  not  be
    against those best interests for them to grow  up  in  Bangladesh,  the
    country of their nationality, with their mother.   Both  children  were
    young enough to adapt to  speaking  Bengali  and  attending  school  in
    Bangladesh. There was no independent evidence about whether they  could
    read or write Bengali at  present,  or  whether  they  would  have  any
    particular difficulty in learning to do so, nor any evidence whatsoever
    as to what Bengali-language education in Bangladesh comprises.

16. The Judge also considered Article 8 ECHR outside the  Rules  but  found
    nothing to satisfy him that leave to remain should be granted.

Grounds of appeal

17. The appellants appealed to the Upper Tribunal.  The grounds  of  appeal
    are  somewhat  diffuse.   The  appellants  argue  that  the   principal
    appellant falls within the parent  route  under  Appendix  FM,  as  the
    parent of a child under 18 who has lived  continuously  in  the  United
    Kingdom for at least 7 years before the application was made.  She is a
    single parent who has sole responsibility for the second appellant  and
    her younger sister. The appellants argue that  paragraph  EX.1  of  the
    Rules has not been properly applied and that the Judge failed to decide
    whether it was reasonable to expect the appellants to leave the  United
    Kingdom.

18. The  grounds  of  appeal  argue  that  the  second  appellant  has  not
    previously been educated in Bangladesh and that she  lacks  appropriate
    understanding of Bengali. The appellants rely on the judgment  of  Lord
    Justice Clarke in EV (Philippines) at [34]-[37] and  contend  that  the
    factors identified (age, length of residence, stage  of  education  and
    linguistic difficulties) point to the second appellant being  permitted
    to remain in the United Kingdom.  They argue that  section  117B(6)  of
    the 2002 Act supports this analysis and  that  removal  of  the  second
    appellant would be incompatible with paragraph 276ADE (iv) and Appendix
    FM of the Rules.

19. The appellants rely also on EA (Article 8  -best  interests  of  child)
    [2011] UKUT 315 (IAC), but  that  decision  predates  the  bringing  of
    Article 8 ECHR into the Rules and later, by statute, into  part  VA  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended).

20. The appellants further contend that it was not open to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to discount the principal appellant's assertion that she would
    not be able financially to support her children in  Bangladesh,  or  at
    least, not to the extent that she is  supported  here.   The  principal
    appellant's estranged husband does not support his family and she feels
    let down by him, after he has made promises to her in the  past.  Given
    the  cumulative  impact  of  the  adverse  effects  of  removing  these
    appellants to Bangladesh, and their 'prospected ominous  way  of  life'
    there, the appellants argue that their removal is disproportionate.

Permission to appeal

21. Both the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal refused  permission
    to appeal.  On 18 May 2017, by  way  of  a  Cart  judicial  review,  Mr
    Justice Mostyn granted permission to appeal on the following basis:

         "... I am satisfied that it is arguable that the Upper Tribunal has
         fallen into serious error by accepting the decision of  the  First-
         tier Tribunal.  I believe that valid criticisms can be made of  the
         first instance decision.  It is strongly arguable  that  mere  lip-
         service has been paid to the best interests  of  the  children.   I
         note that the best interests of the younger child, now aged  nearly
         5, are barely considered; that child is virtually entirely  ignored
         in the First-tier  Tribunal  decision.   By  repeatedly  referring,
         somewhat disparagingly, to the mother's reliance on this factor  as
         an attempted 'trump card', it could be said that  the  significance
         of the children's best interests being a primary consideration  has
         been subconsciously downgraded by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         from its proper status.  It seems indisputable that to return these
         children to what is in effect a completely foreign country for them
         would be directly contrary to their best interests,  yet  this  has
         arguably not been properly weighed when determining that  it  would
         not be unreasonable to send them there. ..."

22. On 7 June 2017, Master Gidden formally  quashed  the  Upper  Tribunal's
    refusal of permission to  appeal.   On  18  July  2017,  Vice-President
    Ockelton granted permission to appeal, based on  the  decision  of  the
    High Court, reminding the parties that the  Upper  Tribunal's  task  is
    that set out in section 12 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act
    2007, that is to say, to decide first whether the decision in  question
    involved the making of an error on a point of law, and if  so,  whether
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside, and if set
    aside, to remit or remake the decision.  No limitation on  arguing  any
    of the grounds of appeal was set.

Rule 24 Reply

23. The respondent on 2 August 2017 filed a Rule 24 Reply, stating that she
    had not received the grounds of appeal with the notice of decision  and
    was therefore 'unable to agree that there is  an  error  in  law  which
    renders the determination unsustainable'.

24. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the  Upper  Tribunal
    for hearing.

Error of law hearing

25. I heard oral submissions from Ms Kabir for the appellants. Much of what
    she submitted was in  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  has  already  been
    summarised.  In addition, Ms Kabir relied on the newspaper  reports  in
    the bundle which indicated that a garment worker  in  Bangladesh  earns
    about �25 a month and that child poverty is a  problem  in  Bangladesh.
    The 'medium schools' which taught in English rather than  Bengali  were
    very expensive.  Ms Kabir agreed that she had not drawn the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge  to  those  press  reports.   Absent  any
    reliance thereon, it is not an error of law for the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge not to deal in detail with destitution in the decision.

26. Ms Kabir argued that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  not  identified
    the children's best interests and it had not been open to him  to  take
    into account 'deliberate overstaying' by the  principal  appellant,  or
    whether she had delayed her application so that  the  second  appellant
    would be a qualifying child, having been in the United  Kingdom  for  7
    years.  Ms Kabir accepted  that  the  key  points  in  the  appellants'
    appeals (abandonment by  her  husband  and  Mr  Uddin,  the  children's
    linguistic ability and the lack of family support  in  Bangladesh)  all
    turned on the principal appellant's  evidence  alone,  which  had  been
    found to be unreliable.  Ms Kabir argued that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had erred in fact and law in his negative credibility  assessment
    and that these elements of the evidence should have been accepted.

27. For the respondent, Mr Kotas noted that the Judge had referred  to  the
    children's best interests in  the  judgment  and  argued  that  he  had
    reached a proper  and  sustainable  decision  thereon.   He  relied  on
    paragraphs [18] and [20] in Zoumbas v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2013] UKSC 74.  While an English  education  was  no  doubt
    desirable, it was not a right for appellants in these circumstances and
    was outweighed by the United Kingdom's right  to  control  immigration.
    The principal appellant had not  explained  her  current  circumstances
    transparently, either in the United Kingdom where she  lived  rent-free
    and worked as a maid, or in Bangladesh,  where  she  still  had  family
    members.  The grounds of appeal were essentially  a  disagreement  with
    the outcome of the appeal and the appeals should be dismissed.



Discussion

28. It is in the best interests of these children to be with their  mother,
    particularly if, as she states, she is their only parent.  It  is  also
    clearly of benefit to them to be educated,  like  their  father  before
    them, in the United Kingdom education system and in English.   However,
    in circumstances where their parent  has  been  living  in  the  United
    Kingdom without leave since 2009 and they are  poorly  integrated  into
    the wider community, relying on  family  friends  and  the  Bangladeshi
    community for accommodation, money and emotional support, the Judge was
    entitled to consider that reliable evidence  of  the  circumstances  to
    which they would return in Bangladesh was required  if  the  appellants
    were to show that they could  not  reasonably  be  expected  to  return
    there.

29. It is not disputed that the paragraph 276ADE is met and that  paragraph
    EX.1 applies to this appeal.  Paragraph EX.1 of the Rules  provides  as
    follows:

         "EX.1. This paragraph applies if

         (a) (i)  the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with a child who-...(cc) is a British Citizen  or  has
         lived in the UK continuously for at least the 7  years  immediately
         preceding the date of application; and

         (ii)  taking  into  account  their  best  interests  as  a  primary
         consideration, it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to
         leave the UK; or ..."

30.  The  second  appellant  is  a   qualifying   child   under   paragraph
    EX.1(a)(i)(cc) but the appellants must show that, taking  into  account
    the second appellant's best interests as a  primary  consideration,  it
    would not be reasonable to expect her  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    The second appellant's younger sister is not yet a qualifying child, so
    that EX.1 does not apply to her, though  her  best  interests  must  be
    taken into account pursuant to section 55.

31. The appellants relied on the decision of the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MA
    (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ
    705 at [88] and [116] in the judgment of Mr Justice Elias,  giving  the
    judgment of the Court.    Giving  the  judgment  of  the  Court  in  MA
    (Pakistan), Lord Justice Elias was guided by the opinion of Lord  Hodge
    JSC, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court in Zoumbas v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 74, at  sub-paragraph  10(7),
    that a child must not be blamed for matters for which he or she is  not
    responsible, such as the conduct of a parent. At [88] in MA (Pakistan),
    Elias LJ said this:

         "88. The second ground was this: having established that  it  would
             be in the children's best interest to  stay  in  the  UK,  the
             judge's findings are entirely contrary to the guidance in  the
             Supreme Court case of Zoumbas at para.10.7 that a "child  must
             not be  blamed  for  matters  for  which  he  or  she  is  not
             responsible, such as the conduct of a parent."... For  reasons
             I have explained above (paras. 41 - 42)  the  conduct  of  the
             parent is relevant to their own situation which bears upon the
             wider public interest and  does  not  amount  to  blaming  the
             children even if they may be prejudiced as a result."

32. The First-tier Tribunal Judge followed that approach.  He did take into
    account the unreliability of the principal appellant's evidence and her
    overstaying, in relation to her, but expressly directed himself not  to
    do so when considering the situation of the second  appellant  and  her
    sister. The best interests of  the  second  appellant  were  considered
    carefully, given  the  very  limited  evidence  about  her  educational
    opportunities here and in Bangladesh.  In particular,  I  observe  that
    there was no country evidence before the Tribunal  about  the  cost  of
    'medium school' English education, nor any evidence about the education
    system in Bangladesh, except that of the principal appellant.  Nor  was
    there any evidence from the principal  appellant's  family  members  in
    Bangladesh (both parents, and a brother and sister, both  of  whom  are
    married), as to their ability or willingness to support the  appellants
    financially or emotionally on return  to  Bangladesh.    The  principal
    appellant's assertion that they would not support  her  carries  little
    weight, given the low credibility of her evidence overall.   The  Judge
    assessed carefully all of the limited evidence of best interests  which
    was produced, and gave proper, intelligible and  adequate  reasons  for
    concluding that it was reasonable to expect the  second  appellant  and
    her younger sister to accompany their mother to Bangladesh.

33. I am guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in EV  (Philippines)
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014]  EWCA  Civ  874  at
    [58]-[60]:

         "58.  In  my  judgment,  therefore,  the  assessment  of  the  best
         interests of the children must be made on the basis that the  facts
         are as they are in the real world. ...If  neither  parent  has  the
         right to remain, then that is  the  background  against  which  the
         assessment is conducted. Thus the ultimate question will be: is  it
         reasonable to expect the child to follow the parent with  no  right
         to remain to the country of origin? ...

         60.  ... In our case none of the family is a British citizen.  None
         has the right to remain in this country. If the mother is  removed,
         the father has no independent right to remain. If the  parents  are
         removed, then it is entirely reasonable to expect the  children  to
         go with them. As the immigration judge found  it  is  obviously  in
         their best interests to remain with their parents. Although it  is,
         of course a question of fact for the tribunal, I  cannot  see  that
         the desirability of being educated at public expense in the UK  can
         outweigh the benefit  to  the  children  of  remaining  with  their
         parents. Just as we cannot provide medical treatment for the world,
         so we cannot educate the world."

34. That is precisely the position in relation to this  appellant  and  her
    children.  The second appellant and her sister are not British citizens
    and neither of their parents is a British citizen or settled here.  The
    second appellant has had no leave to remain since 2009, when she  would
    have been 3 years old, and her younger sister has never  had  leave  to
    remain.  That is not their fault and the Judge properly gave no  weight
    to it in considering the  second  appellant's  appeal.   However,  this
    family would be removed together to Bangladesh, where they have  family
    and could access community support there.

35. The second appellant and her younger  sister  speak  Bengali  and  have
    lived in, and been supported  by,  the  Bangladeshi  community  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The younger child having not begun primary  school  at
    the date of hearing, and only just started now, the question of reading
    and writing either Bengali or English  does  not  arise.  There  is  no
    evidence to suggest that the second appellant has learning difficulties
    such that she would be  unable  to  adjust  on  return  to  Bangladesh,
    including learning to read and write Bengali in due course.  The  judge
    was  entitled  on  that  basis  to  consider   that   any   educational
    difficulties were not such as to outweigh the United Kingdom's right to
    control immigration particularly in relation  to  the  mother  and  her
    extensive overstaying.

36. As regards the assertion by the principal appellant that  she  will  be
    destitute on return to  Bangladesh,  I  have  regard  to  the  complete
    absence of any  evidence  from  her  relatives  in  Bangladesh  or  any
    evidence save hers of her circumstances, educational level  and  social
    background.  I do not consider  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred,
    either in fact or in law,  in  discounting  the  principal  appellant's
    assertion that she would be so destitute on her  return  to  Bangladesh
    that she would be unable to feed or educate her daughters.

37. For all of those reasons and despite the concerns justly  expressed  by
    Mr Justice Mostyn when granting permission on a Cart judicial review in
    this appeal.  The appeal fails and I dismiss it.

Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I do not set aside the decision.
