Representation:

For the claimant: Mr R Arkhurst, instructed by ROCK Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Amina Gad-Asomaning, date of birth 13.11.87, is a citizen
    of Ghana.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Seifert, who allowed the claimant's appeal
    on human rights grounds against the decision of the Secretary of State,
    dated 9.8.13, to refuse her application made on 14.1.13  for  leave  to
    remain in the UK outside the Immigration Rules on compassionate grounds
    with reference to articles 3 and 8 ECHR, and to remove her from the UK.



 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge heard the appeal  on  23.10.13,  but  the
    decision was not promulgated until 4.2.14.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Astle granted permission to appeal on 7.4.14.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 13.5.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  As set out in my decision, promulgated on 15.5.14,  I  found
    there was an error of law in the making of the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal such that the determination of Judge  Seifert  should  be
    set aside. I set the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  aside  and
    adjourned the continuation hearing, reserved to myself. In doing so,  I
    preserved the findings of fact of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  gave
    leave  to  the  claimant  to  adduce  further  evidence  to  bring  her
    circumstances up to date and in particular as  to  the  health  of  her
    daughter.

 6. In summary, I found that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  went  straight
    from considering private life under paragraph 276ADE to  an  article  8
    ECHR proportionality assessment, without considering whether there were
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised in the Immigration
    Rules to justify doing so.  The judge failed to follow the approach set
    out in the prevailing case law, including MF (Nigeria) in the Court  of
    Appeal, and Gulshan  in  the  Upper  Tribunal,  judgements  promulgated
    before that of the First-tier Tribunal. I also found that in the  light
    of  MM  (Zimbabwe),  in  conducting  the  article   8   proportionality
    assessment undue weight  had  been  placed  on  the  claimant's  health
    issues, which were and remain  insufficient  to  cross  the  article  3
    threshold, as conceded by Mr Arkhurst.

 7. My error of law decision is annexed to this determination.

 8. Thus the matter was relisted before me on 3.7.14.  The  representatives
    agreed that as the facts were preserved  there  was  no  need  for  any
    further  oral  evidence  and  the  matter  could  proceed  by  way   of
    submissions.

 9. In addition to the immigration history set out in refusal decision  and
    the First-tier Tribunal decision, the other preserved findings of  fact
    include the following:

      a) That the claimant and Mr Ayeni  both entered the UK  illegally  and
         have no legal basis to remain;

      b) That the claimant and Mr Ayeni were in a  genuine  relationship  as
         partners, had developed a private life in  the  UK,  and  have  two
         children born in the UK in 2008 and 2012;

      c) That the claimant is HIV positive and has  a  treatment  regime  at
         public expense under the NHS (to which she is not in fact entitled)
         and that her drug treatment regime is not available  in  Ghana  but
         that her condition does not reach the article 3 threshold;

      d) That the evidence of the claimant and Mr Ayeni as  to  her  medical
         and emotional condition, their  children,  their  home  and  family
         circumstances, and social connections is credible,  to  the  extend
         that family and private life in the UK has been established;

      e) That neither the claimant nor Mr Ayeni provided a complete  account
         of their work histories in  the  UK  or  their  relationships  with
         claimed family members;

      f) That the claimant had not shown that she  had  no  ties  to  Ghana,
         including family, social and  cultural.  She  spent  the  formative
         years of her life in Ghana;

      g) That removal directions have been given for  removal  to  Ghana  or
         Nigeria and that if returning to either country the family would be
         returning together;

10. It follows from the above that the family would not be split up by  the
    Secretary of State's decision, but removed together either to Ghana  or
    Nigeria.

11. Pursuant to section 55 of the Borders Citizenship and Immigration  Act,
    I have to take  into  account  as  a  primary  consideration  the  best
    interests of the two children, born in the UK  but  Nigerian  citizens.
    Whilst a primary consideration it  is  not  necessarily  the  paramount
    consideration and is not a trump card over all other considerations.

12. In her submissions, Ms Pal  referred  me  to  Azimi-Moayed  and  others
    (decisions affecting children; onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197  (IAC)
    in relation to the approach to the best interests of children.

          (1)  The case  law  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  identified  the
         following principles to assist  in  the  determination  of  appeals
         where children are affected by the appealed decisions:

         i)        As a starting point  it  is  in  the  best  interests  of
         children to be with both their parents  and  if  both  parents  are
         being removed from the  United  Kingdom  then  the  starting  point
         suggests that so should dependent children who form part  of  their
         household unless there are reasons to the contrary.

         ii)      It is generally in the interests of children to have  both
         stability and continuity of social and  educational  provision  and
         the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of the  society  to
         which they belong.

         iii)    Lengthy residence in a country  other  than  the  state  of
         origin can lead to development of social cultural  and  educational
         ties that it would be inappropriate to disrupt, in the  absence  of
         compelling  reason  to  the  contrary.  What  amounts  to   lengthy
         residence is not clear cut  but  past  and  present  policies  have
         identified seven years as a relevant period.

         iv)    Apart from the terms of published policies  and  rules,  the
         Tribunal notes that  seven years from age four   is  likely  to  be
         more significant to a child that the first  seven  years  of  life.
         Very young children are focussed on their parents rather than their
         peers and are adaptable.

         v)      Short periods of residence, particularly ones without leave
         or the reasonable expectation of leave to enter  or  remain,  while
         claims are promptly  considered,  are  unlikely  to  give  rise  to
         private life deserving of respect in  the  absence  of  exceptional
         factors. In any event, protection of  the  economic  well-being  of
         society amply justifies removal in such cases.

         Onward appeals

          (2)  Duties to have regard as a primary consideration to the  best
         interests of a child are so well established that  a  judge  should
         take the point for him  or  herself  as  an  obvious  point  to  be
         considered, where the issue arises on the evidence, irrespective of
         whether the appellants or the advocates have done so.

          (3)  Although in some cases this may require a  judge  to  explore
         whether the duty requires further information  to  be  obtained  or
         inquiry to be made, the judge primarily acts on the evidence in the
         case. Where that evidence gives no hint of a  suggestion  that  the
         welfare of the child is threatened by the immigration  decision  in
         question,  or  that  the  child's  best  interests  are  undermined
         thereby, there is no basis for any further judicial exploration  or
         reasoned decision on the matter.

13. In all the circumstances, given the ages and limited life in the UK,  I
    do not find that there are in this case developed  social  cultural  or
    educational ties that it would  be  inappropriate  to  disrupt  in  the
    absence of compelling circumstances to the contrary.

14. I bear in mind that given their ages  the  children's  life  will  have
    revolved around the claimant and Mr Ayeni. Only the  older  child  will
    have had any schooling in the UK. I find that their best interests  are
    clearly to remain with their mother and Mr Ayeni, whether  in  the  UK,
    Nigeria, or Ghana. I have taken into account the recent information  as
    to their health. However, they are young and will be  able  to  quickly
    adapt to life with the family outside the UK. It is obvious  that  they
    come nowhere near close to meeting  the  requirements  under  paragraph
    276ADE for private life in the UK, nor has it been shown that it  would
    be unreasonable to expect them to accompany their mother on her removal
    from the UK.

15. Without needing to set out reasons  in  detail,  bearing  in  mind  the
    concessions made by Mr Arkhurst, it is obvious and I so find  that  the
    claimant  has  failed  to  demonstrate  that  she  meets   either   the
    requirements of Appendix FM or  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Despite submissions to the contrary, Judge  Seifert  found  that
    the claimant did not meet the requirements of 276ADE and there  was  no
    cross-appeal against that finding, which  must  stand  along  with  the
    preserved findings of fact. Mr Arkhurst also accepted that the claimant
    could not meet the requirements of Appendix FM.

16. That the claimant cannot meet the relevant immigration rules for  leave
    to remain in the UK is  a  highly  relevant  factor.  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE are the Secretary of State's  response  to  claims  in
    respect of private and family life under article 8 and also in  respect
    of section 55 in relation to the best interests of children.

17. Neither the  claimant  nor  Mr  Ayeni  have  any  legitimate  right  or
    expectation to be able to remain in the UK  other  than  in  compliance
    with Immigration Rules. That they have had children whilst  in  the  UK
    does not materially alter their position.  They  are  not  entitled  to
    choose to live and settle in the UK just because that is their wish and
    that they  have  conspicuously  and  deliberately  ignored  or  set  at
    defiance the immigration rules implemented by the Secretary of State to
    control immigration into the UK  as  part  of  the  legitimate  aim  to
    protect the economic well-being of the state.

18. I accept that as there was no 'mechanism' in the Immigration Rules  for
    consideration of exceptional circumstances or insurmountable  obstacles
    to family life being continued in Ghana or Nigeria, following  Shahzad,
    only if there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain
    outside them is it necessary  for  Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to
    consider whether there are compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
    recognised under them.

19. In reality, this appeal comes down to  whether  the  claimant's  health
    amounts  to  such  arguably   compelling   circumstances   insufficient
    recognised in the Immigration Rules. For the reasons set out herein,  I
    find that they do not.

20.  Between  �41  and  �51  Judge  Seifert  summarised  the  evidence  and
    submissions in relation to the claimant's health  and  emotional  well-
    being. There is no need to set that out again and I adopt it  and  take
    it into account as part of this determination. In passing, I note  that
    the expert report suggests that the NHS has assumed responsibility  for
    the claimant's care. That cannot be  correct;  the  claimant  has  been
    receiving treatment to which she is not entitled, having no  legitimate
    basis for her presence in the UK.

21. I take into account that the claimant is again  pregnant,  expecting  a
    third child. Her other children are in good health  and  HIV  negative.
    She had an outpatient appointment  at  the  ante  natal  department  on
    27.6.14.

22. Not previously before the First-tier Tribunal and submitted a few  days
    before the continuation hearing before me, are the following additional
    documents which I have carefully considered and taken into account:

      a) An undated letter from Dr Hawkins, explaining that the claimant has
         been known to be HIV positive since 2005. She had responded well to
         antiretroviral therapy but has had to be switched  to  a  different
         combination of drugs. It is said that this regime is not  currently
         available in Ghana and that "it is imperative that she continues to
         receive antiretroviral therapy to maintain her own health;"

      b) The letter also states that her  medical  and  the  stress  of  the
         immigration proceedings is markedly affecting her psychologically;

      c) A letter from Dr Jayasundaram, locum consultant psychiatrist, dated
         18.6.14, sets out a number of concerns of  the  claimant  affecting
         her mental state, including the pending immigration appeal and  the
         prospect  of  returning  to  Ghana;  feeling  unwell   during   the
         pregnancy; uncertainly (now resolved favourably) about  her  second
         daughter's HIV status; claims of being a victim of rape  in  Ghana;
         and claiming that her family  relationships  in  Ghana  had  broken
         down.

23. Dr Jayasundaram has obviously taken the claimant at her word and on the
    assumption that everything she has said was true and reliable.  In  the
    light  of  the  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  that  is  not
    necessarily so. I have to  bear  in  mind  that  the  doctor  found  it
    difficult to make a full assessment because  the  claimant  was  crying
    throughout the single outpatient appointment on 6.6.14. It was  thought
    that she might benefit from antidepressants. She was referred on to the
    psychology department. In effect, the letter is not  conclusive  as  to
    the claimant's mental state. However, I have taken it into account  and
    given as much weight as I can, assuming from  this  evidence  that  the
    claimant is depressed as a result of number of  uncertainties.  One  of
    those was the HIV status of  her  second  daughter,  which  Dr  Hawkins
    reported was HIV negative.

24. There is no evidence of any illness or medical concern  in  respect  of
    either of the children or the pregnancy.

25. I referred in  my  error  of  law  decision  to  the  authority  of  MM
    (Zimbabwe) in relation to the relationship of health issues not meeting
    the high threshold of article 3 to considerations in respect of article
    8 family life. In that case, Lord Justice Moses found that it  made  no
    sense to refuse to recognise a medical care obligation in  relation  to
    article 3, only to acknowledge it in  relation  to  article  8,  except
    where an individuals private or  family  life  ties  have  a  direction
    bearing on health prognosis.

26. In her submissions Ms Pal referred me to the Upper Tribunal decision of
    Akhalu (health claim: ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT 000400  (IAC),  where
    it was held that MM does not establish that a claimant is  disqualified
    from accessing the protection of article 8 where an aspect of her claim
    is a difficulty or inability to access the  health  care  in  her  home
    country unless her  private  or  family  life  has  a  bearing  on  her
    prognosis.

         "The correct approach, where the proportionality  assessment  stage
         is reached, is not to leave out of account what is, by any view,  a
         material consideration of  central  importance  to  the  individual
         concerned, but to recognise the countervailing public  interest  in
         removal will outweigh  the  consequences  for  the  health  of  the
         claimant because of a disparity of health care  facilities  in  all
         but a very few rare cases. Those consequences have  to  be  weighed
         against the public interest in ensuring that the limited  resources
         of this country's health service are used to the  best  effect  for
         the benefit of those for whom they are intended, those consequences
         do not weigh heavily in the claimant's favour but speak cogently in
         support of the public interest in removal."

27. In that case the claimant was a person who  had  no  knowledge  of  her
    condition before arriving in the UK and in  respect  of  whom,  by  the
    nature of her valid leave to be in the  UK,  had  entitlement  to  care
    under the NHS. She  had  developed  kidney  failure  and  was  given  a
    transplant in the  UK.  It  was  accepted  that  in  the  UK  her  life
    expectancy and quality of life would be normal but  she  would  not  be
    able to afford to access treatment in  Nigeria  and  would  die  within
    weeks. On the facts of that case, the Upper Tribunal accepted  that  it
    was open to the judge to find that it was a case  falling  within  what
    was correctly recognised to be a very small number of cases that  could
    succeed.

28. The correct approach  was  to  have  regard  to  every  aspect  of  the
    claimant's private life including the consequences for  her  health  if
    removed,  "but  to  have  in  mind  when  striking   the   balance   of
    proportionality that  a  comparison  of  levels  of  medical  treatment
    available is something that will not in itself have any real impact  on
    the outcome of the exercise. The judge must recognise...that it will be
    a rare care that succeeds where this is  an  important  aspect  of  the
    claimant's case."

29. I accept that her health and prospects for continuing treatment  is  an
    important aspect of the claimant's case.  That  there  is  a  disparity
    between the quality of the medical treatment that the claimant has been
    accessing in the UK and  that  which  may  be  available  in  Ghana  or
    Nigeria, is pretty obvious  from  the  background  material  and  other
    evidence relied on by the claimant. However, the  Convention  does  not
    impose any obligation on the UK to provide medical care that cannot  be
    accessed in the claimant's home country. The  treatment  the  appellant
    has had was treatment to which she had no entitlement and it was  wrong
    to suggest that the NHS had assumed any formal or legal  responsibility
    for her care. It is not entirely clear when the claimant  came  to  the
    UK, but she has been HIV positive at least since 2005, which  seems  to
    be around  the  time  she  arrived  her  illegally.  Treatment  remains
    available in Ghana. It may be different treatment or a  different  drug
    regime to that which the claimant is presently on, but  treatment  will
    be available. There is no concession in this  case,  as  there  was  in
    Akhalu, that the claimant would inevitably suffer an  unpleasant  death
    within a short period of time if she is returned to her  home  country.
    Further, it is clear that the appellant  will  be  returning  with  her
    family.

30. I take into account the physical and mental  health  concerns  for  the
    claimant, along with her emotional stability, and  that  she  is  under
    ante natal care for a further child.  I  take  into  account  that  her
    current particular drug regime  may  not  be  available  in  Ghana  (or
    Nigeria, although there is no evidence on that). I  take  into  account
    that her stress may be exacerbated by returning to Ghana.

31. I also take into account that the children are settled and  doing  well
    at school and nursery. However, they are in good  health  and  will  be
    able to continue schooling and adapt to life in Ghana, supported by the
    family unit. There was no evidence and  remains  no  evidence  that  Mr
    Ayeni would not be able to live with  the  claimant  in  Ghana  and  no
    reason that he could not use the skills he employed in coming to the UK
    and finding work (albeit illegally) to support  his  family.  They  are
    members of  church  communities  and  will  be  able  to  follow  their
    Christian faith in  Ghana,  which  has  a  large  number  of  Christian
    denominations. Any private life would be  able  to  be  continued  from
    Ghana.

32. In all the circumstances, I find that this is not  one  of  those  rare
    cases where the circumstances  are  so  compelling  that  it  would  be
    disproportionate to  remove  her.  I  have  not  in  fact  reached  the
    proportionality assessment stage as I find, for the  same  reasons  set
    out  above,  that  there  are  no  arguably  compelling   circumstances
    insufficiently  recognised  in  the  Immigration  Rules  that  justify,
    exceptionally, allowing this appeal on the basis of article  8  private
    and or family life outside the Immigration Rules on the basis that  the
    decision is unjustifiably harsh. I find that having failed to meet  the
    Immigration Rules, the appeal falls at this stage without going  on  to
    article 8.

33. However, in taking into account all those  matters  considered  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal  and  raised  in  the  papers  before  me  and  the
    submissions of the claimant's representative, I find that it would also
    follow from the above considerations  that  even  if  there  were  good
    reasons to consider article 8  private  and  family  life  outside  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR, the  appellant  would
    fall  at  the  proportionality  assessment  stage,   as   even   taking
    collectively the facts in relation to her health, her personal, private
    and family circumstances, including her two children and further  child
    expected, the countervailing public interest outweighs the consequences
    for her health on the basis of a disparity between levels or quality of
    medical treatment. Her other  circumstances,  whilst  relevant  to  the
    proportionality  balancing  exercise,  do  not  by  themselves  or   in
    conjunction with her physical and mental  health  concerns  render  the
    decision disproportionate.

Conclusions:

34. In the circumstances, and for the reasons set out herein, I  find  that
    the claimant has failed to demonstrate that she meets the  requirements
    of  the  Immigration  Rules.  I  also  find  that  she  has  failed  to
    demonstrate arguably  good  grounds  for  considering  that  there  are
    compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised in  the  Immigration
    Rules which would justify,  exceptionally  allowing  the  appeal  under
    article 8 ECHR or that demonstrate on the basis that the  decision  was
    unjustifiably harsh (Nagre). I further find that even if the claimant's
    circumstances  were  considered  in  an   article   8   proportionality
    assessment, balancing the interests of the claimant, her  children  and
    partner on the one hand against on the other the legitimate aim of  the
    state to  protect  the  economic  well-being  of  the  UK  through  the
    application   of   Immigration   controls,   the   decision   is    not
    disproportionate. In particular, the  claimant's  physical  and  mental
    health concerns do not outweigh the public interest in her removal.

Decision

35. The appeal is dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr R Arkhurst, instructed by ROCK Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms SL Ong, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

36. The claimant, Amina Gad-Asomaning, date of birth 13.11.87, is a citizen
    of Ghana.

37. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Seifert, who allowed the claimant's appeal
    on human rights grounds against the decision of the Secretary of State,
    dated 9.8.13, to refuse her application made on 14.1.13  for  leave  to
    remain in the UK outside the Immigration Rules on compassionate grounds
    with reference to articles 3 and 8 ECHR, and to remove her from the UK.



38. The Judge heard the appeal  on  23.10.13,  but  the  decision  was  not
    promulgated until 4.2.14.

39. First-tier Tribunal Judge Astle granted permission to appeal on 7.4.14.

40. Thus the matter came before me on 13.5.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

41. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Seifert should be set aside.

42. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Astle noted that, "the  grounds
    assert that the judge failed in  her  assessment  under  article  8  to
    identify the compelling circumstances  required  under  Gulshan  [2013]
    UKUT 00640 (IAC). It is argued that the Rules are a complete  code  and
    the Judge  misdirected  herself  as  to  the  appropriate  test  in  MM
    (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 279. The lack of  equivalent  medical
    care in the home country was only an additional  factor.  Reference  is
    made to GS and EO India [2012] UKUT 00397 (IAC)."

43. "The appellant's representative accepted that they could not  meet  the
    Article 3 threshold. The judge found that  the  first  named  appellant
    could not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE. She then proceeded
    to consider article 8 on its own and it is arguable that she failed  to
    give sufficient reasons for her conclusion given the  caselaw  referred
    to above. Permission is therefore granted."

44. There is a long and convoluted history to this appeal. Judge  Seifert's
    determination sets it out between �17 and �28.

45. The claimant has an appalling immigration history. There  have  been  a
    number of applications by the claimant for permission to remain in  the
    UK on several different grounds, including EEA residence card and human
    rights. Each has been refused. I note that on 21.11.11  an  application
    for leave to remain as the dependent partner of  Mr  Olumuyiwa  Stephen
    Ayeni under articles 3 and 8 ECHR  was  refused.  The  decision  letter
    cites the use of deception in a previous application in an  attempt  to
    gain leave to remain. This was the use of a settlement endorsement from
    her alleged employers,  Admiral.  However,  the  document  contained  a
    permit number relating to a totally different individual.  Her  partner
    has also used false documents in other previous applications.

46. The claimant has never had lawful leave to enter or remain in  the  UK,
    she is assumed to have entered the UK clandestinely. She  has  produced
    evidence to suggest that she was working in the UK,  when  she  had  no
    right to work in the UK and must have been doing so illegally. She  has
    also been in receipt of state benefits to  which  she  has  never  been
    entitled.

47. The refusal decision in respect of the present application is  set  out
    virtually in full at �9 of the determination.  It  is  clear  that  her
    application  in  respect  of  private  and  family  life  was  properly
    considered  under  Appendix  FM,  paragraph  276ADE,  Article  3,   and
    exceptional circumstances.

48. In respect of Appendix FM, because the claimant's relationship with her
    partner and children did not meet the  eligibility  requirements  there
    could be no consideration of EX1 and 'insurmountable obstacles,' within
    Appendix FM.

49. Although Mr Arkhurst submitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    claimant met 276ADE, it is clear from �39 that the judge found that she
    had not lost all ties with Ghana. There is no challenge to that finding
    and it must stand.

50. The judge does not seem to have directly addressed Appendix FM, but  as
    it is clear that the claimant did not meet the requirements,  there  is
    no material error of law  in  that  regard.  However,  the  judge  went
    straight from dealing with paragraph 276ADE in �39 to the  question  of
    article 8 ECHR proportionality in �40.

51. The grounds complain and permission to appeal was granted  because  the
    judge failed to apply MF Nigeria [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 in the  Court  of
    Appeal and Gulshan in the  Upper  Tribunal,  to  the  effect  that  the
    Immigration Rules are to be regarded as a complete  code  and  that  an
    article 8 assessment  should  only  be  carried  out  where  there  are
    compelling circumstances not recognised by the Rules and  which  would,
    exceptionally,  render  the  decision  of  the   Secretary   of   State
    unjustifiably  harsh,  referred  to  in  the  grounds  as   exceptional
    circumstances as defined in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 Admin.

52. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) the Upper Tribunal set out, inter alia, that on the current state
    of the authorities:

     (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may
         be arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  them
         is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether
         there are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised
         under them: R (on the application of) Nagre v  Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);

    (c)    the  term  "insurmountable  obstacles"  in  provisions  such  as
         Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount: MF
         (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]  UKUT  00393  (IAC);  Izuazu
         (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC); they  concern  the
         practical possibilities of  relocation.  In  the  absence  of  such
         insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to  show  other  non-
         standard and particular features demonstrating that removal will be
         unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.

53. In Gulshan the Upper Tribunal considered that it was not  unduly  harsh
    for a husband who originated  from  Pakistan  but  was  now  a  British
    national, to return to Pakistan with his wife who was seeking leave  to
    remain as his spouse. The panel  acknowledged  that  the  couple  would
    suffer some hardship, as he had been in  the  UK  since  2002,  he  had
    worked here and was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and  other
    state benefits, some of which could not be transferred to Pakistan.

54. The Tribunal explained  that  the  Secretary  of  State  addressed  the
    Article 8 family aspects  of  the  respondent's  position  through  the
    Rules,  in  particular  EX1,  and  the  private  life  aspects  through
    paragraph 276ADE. The judge should  have  done  likewise,  also  paying
    attention to the Guidance. Thus the judge should  have  considered  the
    Secretary  of  State's  conclusion  under  EX.1  that  there  were   no
    insurmountable obstacles preventing the continuation of the family life
    outside the UK. Only if there were arguably good grounds  for  granting
    leave to remain outside the rules was it necessary for him for  Article
    8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  were  compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules.

55. More recently, in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:

         (i)Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to identify in her
             decision any legitimate aim under Article  8(2)  of  the  ECHR
             does not prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so  on
             the basis of the materials before it.

          (ii)   "Maintenance of effective immigration control"  whilst  not
             as such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of  the  ECHR  can
             normally be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of
             disorder or crime" or an aspect of "economic well-being of the
             country" or both.

          (iii) "[P]revention of disorder or crime" is normally a legitimate
             aim both in expulsion cases  where  there  has  been  criminal
             conduct on the part of the claimant  and  in  expulsion  cases
             where there have only been breaches of immigration law.

          (iv)  MF  (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  held  that  the  new
             immigration rules regarding deportation of a foreign  criminal
             are  a  complete  code.  This  was  because  of  the   express
             requirement in  them  at  paragraph  398  to  have  regard  to
             exceptional circumstances and other factors.

          (v)    It follows from this  that  any  other  rule  which  has  a
             similar provision will also constitute a complete code;

          (vi) Where an area of the rules does  not  have  such  an  express
             mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for
             the Home Department [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  ([29]-[31]  in
             particular) and Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
             approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after
             applying the requirements of the rules, only if there  may  be
             arguably good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside
             them is it necessary for  Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to
             consider  whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not
             sufficiently recognised under them.

56. In summary, given that there is scope within the Immigration  Rules  to
    consider article 8 rights in respect of family and private life,  there
    is no need to consider article 8 outside the Rules,  unless  there  are
    cogent reasons for considering that there are compelling  circumstances
    which would justify,  exceptionally,  allowing  the  application  under
    article 8 on the basis that the decision produced  a  result  that  was
    unjustifiably harsh.

57. Judge Siefert did not follow the principles set out above. Gulshan  was
    decided 23.10.13, the same  day  as  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
    before Judge Seifert, and not promulgated until 17.12.13, so the  judge
    could not have been aware of it at the First-tier Tribunal hearing, but
    the judge's determination was not promulgated until 4.2.14, long  after
    Gulshan. The  Court  of  Appeal  decision  in  MF  (Nigeria)  had  been
    promulgated  on  8.10.13,  before  Judge  Seifert's  hearing.  In   the
    circumstances, the judge should have followed the case law. It  is  far
    from clear whether, the  case  law  properly  applied,  the  claimant's
    circumstances  could  be  regarded  as  so  compelling  to  justify   a
    consideration of article 8 outside the Immigration Rules. One  relevant
    factor may be that because the claimant did not  meet  the  eligibility
    requirements of FM there  was  no  consideration  of  her  family  life
    circumstances under the Rules, and thus no proportionality  assessment.
    However, failing to identify compelling  circumstances  amounts  to  an
    error of law such that the determination must be set aside and remade.

58. It was further submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  erred  in
    placing undue weight on the claimant's health issues in the  article  8
    considerations, misapplying MM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2012] EWCA  Civ  279.
    There it was held that it makes no  sense  to  refuse  to  recognise  a
    medical care obligation in relation to article 3, but to acknowledge it
    in relation to article 8. At �23 Lord Justice  Moses  stated  that  the
    only cases he could foresee  where  the  absence  of  adequate  medical
    treatment in the country to which a person is to be  deported  will  be
    relevant to article 8, is where  it  is  an  additional  factor  to  be
    weighed in the balance, with other factors which by  themselves  engage
    article 8.  The  example  was  given,  "Supposing...the  appellant  had
    established firm family ties in this country, then the availability  of
    continuing medical treatment here coupled with his  dependence  on  the
    family here  for  support,  together  establish  'private  life'  under
    article 8." Thus medical care is only relevant to article  8  where  an
    individual's personal ties to the UK have a  direct  bearing  on  their
    prognosis. In MM family support in the UK was a key factor  in  keeping
    well a person suffering from schizophrenia.

59. In the light of that case law, the circumstances of  claimant's  health
    in the present case are not such as to establish or support an  article
    8 claim. At their highest, they may be  an  additional  factor,  to  be
    weighed in the balance, but  there  would  have  to  be  other  factors
    sufficient to engage article 8. Mr Arkhurst had conceded that the heath
    issues were insufficient to cross the article 3 threshold. At  �59  the
    judge stated that her HIV and emotional conditions,  referring  to  her
    mental health, including depression, had been  taken  into  account  in
    assessing whether there is a breach of article 8. The same reliance was
    repeated in �60 of the determination. I find that the judge gave  undue
    prominence to the claimant's health in the proportionality  assessment,
    when it is doubtful that it was a relevant factor for article 8 at all.

Conclusions:

60. In the circumstances, and for the reasons set out herein, I  find  that
    making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I adjourn the remaking of the decision.

Directions

   1. The continuation hearing is reserved to myself.


   2. The findings of fact of the First-tier Tribunal are preserved.


   3. The claimant has  leave  to  adduce  further  evidence  to  bring  her
      circumstances up to date and in particular as to  the  health  of  her
      daughter; there being a pending examination. However, given the length
      of  the  adjournment,  the  Tribunal  will  not  likely  entertain  an
      application to further adjourn and the parties must  prepare  for  the
      hearing accordingly.


Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside.
