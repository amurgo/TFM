Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Ali, Counsel instructed by DV Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan whose date of birth is  recorded
    as 11th March 1990.  He made application for leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as the partner of [TI],  a  British  citizen,  on  human
    rights grounds.

 2. On 7th March 2016  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  application
    principally on suitability grounds, it being said that the presence  of
    the applicant in the United Kingdom was not  conducive  to  the  public
    good.  Reliance was placed on  the  suitability  requirements,  and  in
    particular S-LTR.1.6.  It was the Secretary of  State's  case  that  he
    had, on 2nd July 2014, taken an English language test in which  he  had
    used deception because someone else did the speaking part for him.   In
    the event Judge Graham who heard the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State dismissed that appeal.  Judge Graham
    noted that there had been an earlier appeal in which the question as to
    whether or not the Appellant had cheated in that IELTS  test  had  been
    considered by a judge who had found as follows:

         "In the light of the documentary evidence before me I find that the
         Respondent has demonstrated to the higher standard of  the  balance
         of  probabilities  that  the  Appellant  has  been  dishonest   and
         practised a deception when making his application in  October  2012
         by presenting an ETS certificate in English language which was  not
         a valid certificate honestly obtained.  I am also satisfied on  the
         balance of probabilities that the Appellant did admit that  he  had
         not taken the speaking section of the  English  language  test  and
         that the Immigration Officer has honestly recorded his  answers  in
         the course of that interview.  As  to  the  Appellant's  scurrilous
         assertions these may well have been in the nature of  a  last-ditch
         attempt to remain within the United Kingdom but they do not reflect
         well on the Appellant's character or dishonesty".

 3. Those observations and finding came about  because  the  Appellant  had
    been met by an Immigration Officer in 2014 and  had  been  interviewed.
    It was during that interview that the Appellant was recorded as  having
    said, "I did the writing reading and listening, but  someone  else  did
    the speaking test..... I paid the fee of �395 to  Metro  College,  they
    provided someone to take the speaking  test".   That  earlier  hearing,
    preceding that which was before Judge Graham, was before Judge Simpson.
    Her reasons why she accepted the Secretary of State's case  that  there
    had been deception were as follows:

         "Looking carefully at the interview record, the  Appellant's  signs
         twice on the front cover and then once at the bottom of each of the
         two pages of the interview  itself.   The  interview  is  timed  as
         having commenced at 00.5 hours  and  the  Appellant  signed  it  as
         completed at 00.20 hours, thus contradicting his evidence that  the
         interview had lasted for between 30 minutes and an hour.  Moreover,
         his answer to question 5 is unequivocal and while I accept that his
         answer to question 7 is ambiguous and that the �395 may  very  well
         have been the exam entry fee, it is the  admission  in  question  5
         that is relevant.  The Appellant has made various  assertions  i.e.
         that the  Immigration  Officer  did  not  allow  him  to  read  the
         interview prior to signing but given that this was  a  particularly
         short interview it should not have taken much more  than  a  glance
         down  the  page  to  see  the  relevant  answers.   Moreover,   the
         Appellant's implication is that  the  Immigration  Officer  made  a
         false record by writing a confession that was not made.  That is  a
         scurrilous assertion and  the  Appellant  has  given  no  plausible
         reason why the Immigration Officer would do such a thing".

    Judge Simpson dismissed that appeal.

 4. It was open to the Appellant to appeal the decision of Judge Simpson if
    so advised and it is common ground that in fact the Appellant did  make
    application for permission to appeal but did not  pursue  it.   It  had
    been his case that applications made to the Home Office to provide  the
    transcript of the interview, which he contends was  in  existence,  was
    not responded to by the Secretary of State and if such a transcript did
    exist, then it was open to the Appellant to apply  for  an  adjournment
    before Judge Simpson and seek to challenge the finding  in  the  event.
    As I say the Appellant withdrew the appeal and therefore was fixed with
    those findings subject  to  any  additional  evidence  which  might  be
    adduced in the subsequent hearing, as indeed was the case before  Judge
    Graham.

 5. The principal evidence upon which the Appellant relied in  the  instant
    appeal, in the First-tier Tribunal, although he and  the  Sponsor  both
    gave evidence, was expert evidence from Dr Holmes.  Although Dr  Holmes
    was of the view that the voice file provided to her by the  Appellant's
    solicitors was consistent with the voice file of the  person  who  took
    the speaking test, Judge Graham did not  accept  expert's  conclusions.
    The reasons for not accepting the  eventual  conclusion  of  Dr  Holmes
    that, "the evidence lend moderately strong support  to  the  view  that
    Naqash Azeem is the questioned speaker" were as follows:

      1) That Dr Holmes had not been provided with a copy of the Appellant's
         record  of  interview  or  the  determination  of  Judge   Simpson.
         Reference was made by  Judge  Graham  to  AAW  (Expert  evidence  -
         weight) Somalia [2015] UKUT 673 which gave guidance where there was
         a failure to comply with Practice Direction 10  -  Immigration  and
         Asylum Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal.

      2) Although the expert said that she had been instructed  "to  compare
         the voice and speech patterns of the speaker recorded in  a  series
         of six TOEIC recordings with the speech of a known sample of Naqash
         Azeem ..." and "I was supplied with  an  audio  file  containing  a
         sample of the known speech of Naqash Azeem which I  understand  was
         recorded by DV Solicitors at their premises in accordance  with  my
         guidance for preparation of a reference  recording"  there  was  no
         statement  from  the  Appellant's  representatives  confirming  the
         circumstances in which the voice sample was  obtained  or  how  the
         Appellant's identity was confirmed.  Additionally, Judge Graham was
         not satisfied that the voice sample was obtained  in  a  controlled
         environment given that the  expert  made  reference  to  background
         speech from other speakers in the recording.  Judge Graham was  not
         satisfied that the comparative voice recording was provided by  the
         Appellant leaving open the possibility that it was the proxy  taker
         who also prepared the comparative voice recording.

 6. That finding was key to what then followed because  having  found  that
    the decision of Judge Simpson remained undisturbed  by  the  additional
    evidence, looking to the wider application of Article 8, and  the  best
    interests of the  children,  still  Judge  Graham  found  that  it  was
    proportionate for the Appellant to be  required  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom and that his family could go with him if they wished to do  so.
    Although the Sponsor was born in the United Kingdom she was a cousin of
    the Appellant, there were, she found, no sufficient factors weighing in
    the Appellant's favour nor indeed nothing preventing the Appellant from
    applying for entry clearance from Pakistan  once  he  met  the  English
    language requirements.  It would be open to the Sponsor,  Judge  Graham
    found, to support that application from the United Kingdom.

 7. Not content with that decision, application was made for permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal which permission was granted on 18th April
    2018 by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cruthers  though  in  granting
    permission I note that Judge Cruthers was giving  little  encouragement
    since in the grant of permission he said, "the Appellant and his family
    members should not take this grant as any indication  that  the  appeal
    ultimately will be successful".

 8. The grounds submit firstly that the weight given to the  expert  report
    was insufficient and in observing that there was the  possibility  that
    the proxy taker also prepared the comparative voice recording,  it  was
    being  suggested  that  the  expert,  and  "more  so"  the  Appellant's
    solicitors, were complicit in the deception.  It was further  suggested
    that it was not clear from the determination whether the judge  alerted
    the parties of those concerns raised in the  determination.   I  should
    point out at this stage that I raised with Mr Ali whether or not he had
    any notes, or a statement from whomsoever represented the Appellant  at
    the First-tier, in order that he could pursue that point.   He  accepts
    that he did not have any notes to support the contention.  It seems  to
    me that without the ability to support the contention  that  the  judge
    did not raise this concern, this aspect of  the  appeal  goes  nowhere.
    The judge is not required to deal with each and every point within  the
    decision and reasons.

 9. The second ground was in reality an attempt to revisit the finding made
    by Judge Simpson that the Appellant had  used  deception.   The  ground
    says:

         "Overlooked the fact that there was no evidence to prove  that  the
         Appellant had used a proxy".

10. That ground is clearly flawed because there was evidence.  The evidence
    was the written record of interview with the Appellant.  The fact  that
    the Appellant denied having said what was recorded did  not  stop  what
    was recorded being evidence.

11. Insofar as those grounds then seek to challenge  the  finding,  and  if
    there was any merit, the appropriate venue was a timely appeal  pursued
    to the Upper Tribunal at the appropriate time; not now in this  appeal.
    However, the Appellant continues to submit that the Secretary of  State
    had failed to discharge the legal and evidential burden  on  the  basis
    there was no evidence to prove  that  the  recordings  established  any
    proxy being used.  I am satisfied  that  there  was  evidence  for  the
    reasons I have just stated.

12. The third ground submits that  the  decision  was  perverse  given  the
    existence of a British partner and British children, all  the  more  so
    when it had been accepted that the Appellant was the children's primary
    carer  with  the  Sponsor  being  a  locum  pharmacist  and  being  the
    breadwinner.  It was  further  said  that  to  equate  the  Appellant's
    behaviour as criminal was to have erred.  The second Ground 3  set  out
    at paragraph 18 of the grounds was that the judge  had  erred,  it  was
    said, in applying factors in Section 117B of the 2002  Act  to  justify
    the Appellant's removal as if these were aggravating factors.

13. The question for me is whether the findings made by Judge  Graham  were
    open to her.  She quite properly took, as her starting point, the  case
    of Devaseelan.  The starting point in this case was that the  Appellant
    had practised deception.  That was the finding of the earlier  Tribunal
    hearing.  The  question  for  Judge  Graham  was  whether  the  further
    evidence, taken together with  the  evidence  that  Judge  Simpson  had
    looked at, was capable of leading to a different conclusion, or  indeed
    ought to have led to a different conclusion.  It is not suggested  that
    Judge Graham applied the guidance in Devaseelan incorrectly.   What  is
    submitted is that insufficient weight was given to  the  report  of  Dr
    Holmes.

14. It seems to  me  absolutely  remarkable  that  although  there  was  an
    application before me  to  adduce  additional  evidence  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal in the form of an addendum to the report of Dr  Holmes,  there
    was still no statement from the Appellant's representatives  confirming
    the circumstance in which a  voice  sample  was  obtained  or  how  the
    Appellant's identity was confirmed.  When I raised this  with  Mr  Ali,
    recognising that it was late in the day, he nevertheless asked  for  an
    adjournment.  I refused the same.   The  test  for  an  adjournment  is
    always one of fairness but the solicitors must  have  been  well  aware
    that there  was  a  concern  that  there  was  no  statement  from  the
    Appellant's representatives as mention was made at paragraph 20 of  the
    Decision and Reasons and, indeed, the grounds themselves focused on the
    very point.  It would have been an easy defect to cure and Mr  Ali  had
    no answer as to why there was no witness statement though he  suggested
    that it was something which the Appellant's representatives might  have
    overlooked.

15. As to the addendum to the report  of  Dr  Holmes  which  was  there  to
    address those parts  which  were  otherwise  lacking,  I  would  simply
    observe that the judge was entitled to make  findings  based  upon  the
    evidence that was before her.  An appeal in the First-tier Tribunal  is
    not a dress rehearsal for an onward appeal; it is the hearing  and  if,
    as is clearly recognised now  by  the  application  to  adduce  further
    evidence, then that better evidence should have been done at the  first
    hearing.  There was no suggestion that it  could  not  have  been  made
    available at that time: Ladd v Marshall.

16. It remains the case, in my judgment, that it was open to Judge  Graham,
    against the background of a finding of deception, to fins as  was  done
    and to require sufficient evidence, if the burden of proof  was  to  be
    discharged, that the voice that the expert was being asked  to  compare
    was that of the Appellant.  Some continuity evidence was required.   It
    was not sufficient for Dr Holmes to say that the voice files  had  been
    obtained at the solicitor's office; it was for  the  solicitor  to  say
    that it had been obtained at the solicitor's office, for  otherwise  it
    left open the possibility that the Appellant, as alluded  to  by  Judge
    Graham, was brought to the solicitor's office by the  Appellant  to  be
    sent to Dr Holmes.  I simply do not know even if  the  voice  file  was
    taken at the solicitor's office whether it was a different solicitor at
    that practice, who did not know  the  Appellant,  who  took  the  voice
    recording, so that in fact it was the proxy who came to give the  voice
    file.  I do not make a finding; what I do is to look at the finding  of
    Judge Graham and ask whether it was open to her.   In  my  judgment  it
    clearly was.

17. Having found that the Appellant had used deception  she  then  went  on
    quite properly to embark upon the balancing exercise  starting  on  the
    one hand with what was in the public interest: the  deception  used  by
    the Appellant, and then the best interests of the children (at the time
    of the appeal there had only been one).  The judge  accepted  that  the
    Appellant was the child's primary carer and had found that it  was  the
    Sponsor's choice whether or not to follow the Appellant to Pakistan and
    continue family life there or  support  him  from  the  United  Kingdom
    whilst he made his application in proper form.  Although there  was  no
    conviction in respect of the deception the judge was right to  describe
    this at least as criminal conduct  for  deception  clearly  is  in  the
    circumstance in which this was conducted.  Of course, in  finding  that
    this was criminal conduct I do so only by applying the  civil  standard
    which was what Judge Graham did and was something that was open to her.
     In any event in my judgment describing the conduct as criminal is  not
    material, it clearly was reprehensible and sufficient to weigh  heavily
    in the public interest.

18. Having considered all of the factors including Section 117B of the 2002
    Act the judge came again in my judgment to a finding that was  open  to
    her.  This appeal appears to me to be not so much about errors  of  law
    but a challenge to findings of fact which were open to this judge.  The
    judge described  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the
    Immigration Rules because he was on temporary admission and  could  not
    meet the English language provisions in  Appendix  FM,  as  aggravating
    factors.  Clearly what the judge meant  by  that  was  that  they  were
    factors which weighed in the public interest.  It may have been  unwise
    to use the word "aggravating" but it  is  not  material  in  this  case
    because anyone reading this decision as a whole knows exactly what  the
    judge meant and the judge was balancing the various factors and  indeed
    quite properly had regard to Section 117B(1) which was that maintenance
    of effective immigration control is in the public interest;  provisions
    relating to financial independence; relationships formed when a  person
    is in the United Kingdom unlawfully; and  when  immigration  status  is
    precarious.  I note that the judge referred to 117B(3) which relates to
    financial independence rather than (4) but if I were  to  have  re-made
    this appeal I would have re-made it  in  any  event  exactly  as  Judge
    Graham did noting that little weight is to be given to  a  relationship
    formed with a qualifying partner established by a person at a time when
    the person in the United Kingdom is present unlawfully

19. I refer to paragraph 12 of the case of VW (Sri Lanka) [2013]  EWCA  Civ
    522 in which McCombe LJ said at paragraph 12:

         "Regrettably, there is an increasing tendency in immigration cases,
         when a First-tier Tribunal Judge has given  a  judgment  explaining
         why he has reached a particular decision, of seeking to burrow  out
         industriously areas of evidence that have  been  less  fully  dealt
         with than others and then to use this as a  basis  for  saying  the
         judge's decision is legally flawed because he did not deal  with  a
         particular matter more fully.  In my judgment, with  respect,  that
         is no basis on which to sustain a proper  challenge  to  a  judge's
         finding of fact ...".

20. Despite Mr Ali's submissions and despite his  skeleton  argument  which
    runs to eighteen paragraphs, I find that the appeal is to be dismissed.

21. I would make this final observation.  There is nothing in what  I  have
    said or indeed in what Judge Graham found that should be interpreted as
    casting  any  dispersions  on  the  manner  in  which  the  Appellant's
    solicitors conducted.   Firstly,  Ms  Everett  rightly  submitted  that
    solicitors are quite capable of being lied to  or  deceived,  but  that
    does not mean that there was dishonesty on their  part,  and  secondly,
    just as the witness statement from  the  Appellant's  solicitors  might
    have  been  overlooked,  so  too  might  they   have   overlooked   the
    circumstances in  which  the  voice  file  was  obtained  before  being
    submitted to Dr Holmes.  As I say,  it  was  perfectly  open  to  Judge
    Graham to  make  the  findings  that  were  made  and  this  appeal  is
    dismissed.   The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  therefore  is
    affirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
