Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Gilbert, Counsel instructed by Tamil Welfare
Association
     (Romford Road)
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka.  Her sponsor and husband is Mr
    Paramasamy Nithyanannthan.  She appeals against  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge M P W Harris promulgated after a  hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on 23 January 2013 in which he dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer  in  Chennai
    refusing to provide the appellant with  entry  clearance  to  join  her
    spouse for the purposes of settlement.  There was one issue before  the
    judge and that was whether the appellant met the financial requirements
    for entry clearance.  The significant Rule is Rule 6A  which  sets  out
    the scheme:

         "For the purposes of these Rules a person (P) is not to be regarded
         as having (or potentially having) recourse to public  funds  merely
         because P is (or will be) reliant in whole or  in  part  on  public
         funds provided to P's sponsor unless, as a result of  P's  presence
         in the United Kingdom, the sponsor is (or  would  be)  entitled  to
         increased or additional public funds save where such entitlement to
         increased or additional public funds is by  virtue  of  P  and  the
         sponsor's joint entitlement to benefits under Regulations  referred
         to in paragraph 6B."

 2. In the present case the issue was whether  or  not  employment  support
    allowance should be taken into account in assessing the level of income
    which should be assessed in the hands of the sponsor who  is  partially
    disabled.  It was the parties' agreement  at  the  hearing  before  the
    judge and recorded by him in paragraph 21 that he was not permitted  to
    take into account income of �121.65 per  week  which  the  sponsor  was
    receiving as employment support allowance.   It  was  however  accepted
    that the judge could take into account disability living  allowance  of
    �42.10.  It appears now to be  accepted  that  the  employment  support
    allowance can properly be taken into account.  This  was  income  which
    was available to the sponsor.  It was income to which he  was  entitled
    as a result of his physical needs but it was income which was  his  and
    he could use in his own hands.  If it could be taken into account  then
    it would increase the level of benefits that the appellant receives and
    therefore the maintenance that he receives to a figure of  �163.75  per
    week, the calculation  being  that  employment  support  allowance  was
    �121.65, disability living allowance  was  �42.10.   The  yardstick  by
    which the case had to be assessed  was  that  a  couple  would  receive
    �112.55 as being the appropriate level of income  support.   There  was
    therefore a comfortable surplus of �50 a week.

 3. In addition the judge was required  to  consider  whether  or  not  the
    additional burden on council tax should properly be taken into account.
      Council  tax  would  be  payable  and  I  have  been  provided   with
    documentation that the average council tax per dwelling is some �1,045.
     In relation to this particular  property  the  council  tax  might  be
    somewhat lower but not substantially so.  I am satisfied that that  the
    surplus that is available of about �50 a week is  capable  of  bridging
    the additional burden of council tax that will be payable and in  those
    circumstances I am satisfied that the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules were met and accordingly the  applicant  was  entitled  to  entry
    clearance in the capacity sought.

DECISION

    The Judge made  an  error  on  a  point  of  law  and  I  substitute  a
    determination allowing
     the appeal under the Immigration Rules.
                                                                       [pic]

FEE AWARD
Having allowed the appeal I make a fee award.
