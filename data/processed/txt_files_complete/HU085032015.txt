For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Sudan, born on 8 April 1985.

 2. This decision is to be read with:

      i) The ECO's refusal of entry clearance, dated 21 September 2015.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the FtT, filed on  16  October
         2015: "The decision of the ECO is not in accordance with article  8
         ECHR as the appellant enjoys family life with the sponsor  and  the
         UK is the only country [where] that family life can be enjoyed".

    iii) The determination by FtT Judge Mozolowski, promulgated  on  2  June
         2017, dismissing the appeal.

     iv) The appellant's application for permission to appeal filed with the
         FtT, dated 28 June 2017, part C, reasons for  appealing  -  grounds
         set out as 1 (i) - (xii).

      v) The refusal of permission by FtT Judge  Keane,  dated  22  November
         2017.

     vi) The appellant's application for permission to appeal filed with the
         UT, dated 14 December 2017, on the same grounds.

    vii) The grant of permission by UTJ Plimmer, dated 29 January 2018.

 3. Having heard the submissions, I reserved my decision.

 4. One theme of the grounds is that the judge applied "a  higher  standard
    of proof" - (i), (iii), and (vi).  However, there was not  said  to  be
    anything wrong with the judge's self-direction at �12.   There  was  no
    reference to any passage in her  decision  which  might  bear  out  the
    contention that she misunderstood such a basic matter.

 5. This is only a way of dressing up disagreement on the facts as error on
    a point of law.

 6. Another theme of the grounds is absence of reasons -  (i),  (v),  (vi),
    (vii), (ix), and (x).   This  takes  separate  short  passages  out  of
    context.  Reasons are to be understood by reading decisions fairly  and
    as a whole.  Challenges must be framed within such a reading.

 7. No general error of absence of reasoning is established.

 8. Ground (xi) says that the judge should not have relied upon a US  State
    Department report which was not lodged by either party, and in so doing
    "stepped into the shoes of the Home Office".  Ms Loughran, rightly, did
    not advance this ground.  The report is not the outcome of unauthorised
    internet research of a point of which parties should have been  put  on
    notice.  The  report  is  within  the  public  domain  and  the  common
    knowledge of representatives and judges.  The  matter  taken  from  the
    report is that official documents may be obtained through corruption in
    Sudan.  That is also well known.  The ground does not suggest it to  be
    wrong, or even contentious.

 9. Ground (iv) is based on the judge at �27  observing  that  money  would
    have had to be sent to the appellant to pay for visa applications.  Mrs
    O'Brien accepted that this  shows  error  of  fact.   Applications  for
    refuge family reunion do not require a fee.   She  submitted  that  the
    matter was irrelevant, and did not translate into error of law.

10. The  judge  does  appear  at  �27  to  have  given  this  some  adverse
    significance.  I find it difficult to see why.  To assist the appellant
    with payment of a fee for her application rather than, or as  well  as,
    with her living expenses does not obviously yield anything  adverse  to
    the nature of the relationship.  However, if this does  translate  into
    legal error it is plainly minor, because the judge goes on  immediately
    to make it clear that what she finds significant is not this issue  but
    the period over which remittances were made.

11. The greatest force to be found in the grounds is at  (viii)  and  to  a
    lesser extent at (ix), challenging the judge's view of the visit by the
    sponsor to Egypt in 2016 and of the extensive records of  contact  with
    the appellant, contributing to her finding of no genuine and subsisting
    relationship.  She was  not  prepared  to  go  further  than  that  the
    appellant and sponsor might have  known  each  other  since  2014.  She
    mentioned at �31 "some photographs" on which she placed "no  particular
    reliance" and thought there was  no  indication  who  the  sponsor  was
    visiting in Egypt "apart from his own evidence".  Ms  Loughran  pointed
    to clear documentary evidence (passports, visas, travel tickets, and so
    on) that the appellant and sponsor were both in Egypt at the same  time
    and to a multitude of photographs showing them  together  in  and  near
    Cairo -evidence which the grounds contend  that  the  judge  failed  to
    consider.

12. Mrs O'Brien countered on this branch of the case that the decision  had
    to be read as a whole, and that the judge's good reasons  for  doubting
    whether there was a relationship at all prior to  2104  inevitably  fed
    into and justified her findings about the later period.

13. Ms Loughran rightly recognised that grounds (i) and (ii), going to  the
    judge's finding that no marriage took place between the  appellant  and
    the sponsor in 2007,  were  crucial.  If  the  appellant  was  not  the
    sponsor's wife prior to his departure from Sudan, her case fell.

14. The case advanced to the FtT was that the appellant and sponsor married
    formally in Sudan on 17 July 2007, but no documentation was  issued  on
    the day; he left Sudan in May 2008; travelled through Libya to  Greece,
    where he spent 6 years; and arrived in the UK on 6 May 2014.   In  2015
    there were obtained the items copied and translated at items C and D of
    the appellant's inventory 1 in the FtT.  His representatives  have  the
    originals.  C is headed "document of marriage contract" dated  8  April
    2015, attesting the marriage on 17 July 2007, issued by  the  clerk  of
    the Personal Status Court  in  Khartoum.   D  is  headed  "contract  of
    marriage", issued by the matrimonial clerk on 11 April 2015,  referring
    to the marriage on 17 July 2007 and bearing to  be  a  "certificate  of
    marriage approved as an extract of the original".

15. In submissions it was suggested that the judge simply misunderstood the
    nature of the documents, and that although  dated  in  2015  they  were
    clear evidence of a marriage taking place in 2007; or that  the  judge,
    as those  grounds  say,  applied  "a  higher  standard  of  proof",  or
    speculated.

16. I am unable to find merit in these crucial grounds.

17. The judge clearly understood that  although  dating  from  2015,  these
    documents were intended as proof of a marriage formalised in  2007.   I
    see in the decision the following reasons:

      i) No photographs of the wedding.

     ii) Absence of photographs was firstly said to be for cultural reasons,
         but later it was due to dire poverty. That was the  sponsor's  oral
         evidence.

    iii) No good explanation for absence of photographs.

     iv) No evidence of living together in Sudan in 2007 - 2008.

      v) Sponsor said no marriage certificate was then needed, but the judge
         thought a  family  book  would  have  been  required  for  Sudanese
         government records in 2007, or  some  other  indication  of  living
         together might exist.

     vi) Official documents are available through bribery and corruption.

    vii) The marriage was said to have been delayed from 2002  to  2007  for
         the  appellant  to  complete  her   education,   which   was   also
         incompatible with dire poverty.

   viii) Evidence of remittances only from 2014.

     ix) "Total silence" in confirming alleged contact, not only  while  the
         sponsor was en route for 7 years, but after arrival.

      x) Explanations about lack of telephone history  from  Greece  and  of
         lost sim card in the UK not accepted.

     xi) Reference in messages by sponsor to appellant as a prince, not as a
         princess.

    xii) Having heard the sponsor give evidence, he  was  "not  particularly
         credible" (�31 and 33).

18. The judge had to decide whether a pre-flight relationship existed.  The
    evidence entitled her to do so one way  or  the  other.   She  had  the
    advantage of hearing the sponsor's oral evidence, and was bound to take
    a view of it.  The eventual finding of  "lacking  credibility"  is  not
    made in a vacuum.  Some of her reasons for coming down on the side  she
    did are obviously stronger than others; but taking them together,  they
    are, at the least, legally adequate.  The appellant has not shown  that
    they have been arrived at through the making of any error on a point of
    law.

19. There was more obvious scope  for  finding  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship since 2014; but the judge, although with a markedly lesser
    degree of  certainty,  found  the  evidence  insufficient  to  reach  a
    favourable finding for that period either.  Taking the  decision  as  a
    whole, that conclusion also shows no error of  law.  In  any  event,  a
    different finding on that issue would not change the outcome.

20. The grounds and submissions do not disclose in terms of section  12  of
    the 2002 Act that the making of the decision of the  FtT  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law, such that  it  ought  to  be  set
    aside.  That decision shall stand.

21. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
