Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal G A Black who, in a  decision  promulgated  on  12/01/2015,
       dismissed the appeals of Mrs E Bandaranyaka (the 1st Appellant)  and
       Mr P Samarawickrama (the 2nd Appellant and spouse and  dependent  of
       the 1st Appellant), both nationals of Sri Lanka,  against  decisions
       of the respondent to refuse to issue the 1st Appellant further leave
       to remain as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  and  to  refuse  the  2nd
       Appellant leave to remain  as  the  Dependent  Partner  of  the  1st
       Appellant, and to remove both appellants under  section  47  of  the
       Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

Decision of the First-tier Judge

    2. The Appellants applications for further leave to remain were refused
       on the basis that the 1st Appellant did not have  available  to  her
       ï¿½2,560 for a consecutive 28 day period as required by Appendix C  to
       the immigration rules. Her application for further  leave  contained
       bank statements belonging to the 2nd  Appellant.  His  account  held
       sufficient funds. The Respondent  did  not  however  find  that  the
       requirements of paragraph 13 of Appendix C  were  satisfied  as  the
       funds were not in the 1st Appellant's sole or joint account, or  her
       parents or legal guardian's account.

    3. At the First-tier Tribunal (FtT) hearing on 05 January 2015  counsel
       who represented the Appellants, who was not counsel who drafted  the
       Grounds,  conceded  that  the  1st  Appellant  did  not   meet   the
       requirements of the immigration rules and  that  evidence  of  funds
       available in Sri Lanka could not be relied on (paras 7 &  8  of  the
       FtT determination). It was submitted at the  hearing  that  the  1st
       Appellant met the spirit of the rules and that she  had  established
       that she had full access to the funds and  that  the  2nd  Appellant
       agreed to finance her studies from the funds in his account.

    4. The Judge was satisfied the evidence  relied  on  was  credible  but
       found  the  Appellants  failed  to  meet  the   specific   mandatory
       requirements of  the  immigration  rules.  The  fact  that  the  1st
       Appellant had access to the funds in practice  took  the  matter  no
       further. Counsel  did  not  seek  to  rely  on  Article  8  and  the
       appellants were dismissed.

Grant of permission

    5. The Grounds of Appeal originally served on the  First-tier  Tribunal
       for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal were relatively vague
       and lacked particularisation. It was claimed that the 1st  Appellant
       had,  in   essence,   sufficient   funds   and   that   insufficient
       consideration was given to that evidence and that the  decision  was
       not compatible with the law. These grounds were properly refused  by
       Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Frankish on 17 March 2015.

    6. Amended Grounds were however provided to the Upper Tribunal, drafted
       by other counsel. These amended Grounds asserted that  paragraph  13
       of Appendix C had to be read in conjunction with  paragraph  (c)  of
       Appendix E and that, on  such  a  reading,  the  1st  Appellant  was
       entitled to rely on the funds in the 2nd Appellant's  bank  account.
       It was submitted that, following Mahad [2009] UKSC 16,  one  had  to
       adopt a sensible construction of the immigration rules and  that  it
       made little sense if the 1st Appellant could rely  on  her  parents'
       funds but not those of her husband. It was  further  submitted  that
       the Respondent failed to apply paragraph 245AA  of  the  immigration
       rules or her 'evidential flexibility' policy,  and  that  the  Judge
       ought to have considered the conclusions of the  Upper  Tribunal  in
       CDS (PBS "available" Article 8) Brazil [2010] UKUT 305  (IAC)  where
       funds were said to be 'available' to a person as the  material  time
       if  they  belonged  to  a  third  party  but  the  party  had  shown
       willingness to deploy them to support the  person  for  the  purpose
       contemplated. Permission was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge
       to argue these points.

The hearing

    7. At  the  hearing  the  Appellants  indicated  they  were  no  longer
       represented by Shanthi & Co. I was informed by  my  clerk  that  the
       Upper Tribunal had received a letter from  these  solicitors  on  07
       July  2015  indicating  that  they  had  come  off  the  record.  No
       correspondence had however made its way to the Tribunal file.


    8. The 1st Appellant indicated that her father passed away  two  months
       ago and that she did not, as a result, have access to funds. As such
       she could not afford to pay for representation at the  hearing.  She
       requested an adjournment. There was no evidence of the death of  her
       father. I asked the 1st Appellant what she would be able  to  do  if
       there  was  an  adjournment.  She  indicated  that  she  wanted   an
       adjournment for a visa. The adjournment application was  opposed  by
       the Presenting Officer. Given that I had relatively detailed grounds
       of appeal, and given the narrow issue of construction that I had  to
       consider, and having already preliminarily considered  the  relevant
       immigration rules, I did not consider that  it  was  appropriate  to
       adjourn  the  hearing  and  that,  following  Nwaigwe  (adjournment:
       fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC), the Appellants would  not,  as  a
       result of my decision not to adjourn, be deprived of the benefit  of
       a fair hearing.

    9.  I  explained  to  the  Appellants  that  I  would  not  grant   the
       adjournment. I indicted to them that I had read  all  the  documents
       before me and that I was aware of the basis of the  appeal.   And  I
       asked them whether there was anything further they  wished  to  add.
       The 1st Appellant indicated that she  was  unable  to  open  a  bank
       account in her own name or become a joint account  holder  with  her
       husband. The 1st Appellant indicated that she wanted to study,  that
       she still had money in Sri Lanka,  and  that  she  wanted  the  case
       'finished or not'. I heard submissions from the  Presenting  Officer
       and reserved my decision.

Discussion

   10. The Grounds contend that paragraph 13 of Appendix C must be read  in
       conjunction with  paragraph  (c)  of  Appendix  E  and,  on  such  a
       conjunctive reading, the immigration rules  can  be  interpreted  as
       allowing the 1st  Appellant  to  rely  on  the  funds  held  in  her
       husband's bank account.

   11. paragraph 13 of Appendix C reads:

           Funds will be available to the applicant only where the
           specified documents show or, where permitted by these Rules, the
           applicant confirms that the funds are held or provided by:
           (i) the applicant (whether as a sole or joint account holder);
           and/or
           (ii) the applicant's parent(s) or legal guardian(s), and the
           parent(s) or legal guardian(s) have provided written consent
           that their funds may be used by the applicant in order to study
           in the UK; and/or
           (iii) an official financial sponsor which must be Her Majesty's
           Government, the applicant's home government, the British Council
           or any international organisation, international company,
           University or Independent school.

   12. On the face of it this paragraph excludes from  consideration  funds
       held in the 2nd Appellant's bank account, unless the  1st  Appellant
       is a joint account holder.

   13. Appendix E is entitled,  "Maintenance  (funds)  for  the  family  of
       Relevant Points Based Systems Migrants". Paragraph (c) reads,

           Where the applicant is applying as the  Partner  of  a  Relevant
           Points Based System Migrant the relevant amount of funds must be
           available to either the applicant or the Relevant  Points  Based
           System Migrant.

   14. The Appellants argue that, as it is sufficient for the purposes of a
       partner of a relevant PBS migrant if the required level of funds  is
       available to  the  partner,  partner,  so,  in  turn,  it  would  be
       sufficient that the partner holds the required level  of  funds  for
       the relevant PBS migrant.

   15. Having regard to  the  structure  and  purpose  of  Appendix  C  and
       Appendix E, and to the specific wording of the  provisions  of  both
       Appendixes, I cannot accept this submission.

   16. The purpose of Appendix E  is  to  ensure  that  dependents  of  the
       relevant PBS migrant have available to them  sufficient  funds.  The
       focus of Appendix E is upon the partner or child of a  relevant  PBS
       migrant rather than the migrant him or herself. In the present  case
       the 1st Appellant is the relevant PBS migrant.

   17. It is sufficient for the purposes of Appendix E  that  the  relevant
       PBS migrant has the  required  funds.  There  is  no  need  for  any
       dependent  of  the  relevant  PBS  migrant   to   hold   the   funds
       independently. However, Appendix E does  not  deal  with  the  quite
       separate requirements that the relevant PBS migrant must meet. Those
       are dealt with in Appendix C. The wording of  Appendix  C  is  quite
       clear. The 2nd Appellant is not a person in respect of whom the  1st
       Appellant can rely to demonstrate that she has  the  required  funds
       available to her.

   18. Further, paragraph (aa) of Appendix E indicates that  paragraphs  1A
       and 1B of Appendix C also apply to Appendix E.  Paragraph  1A(a)  of
       appendix C indicates that the relevant PBS  migrant  must  have  the
       funds specified in the relevant part of Appendix C at  the  date  of
       the application, and paragraph 1A(c) requires that the relevant  PBS
       migrant had those funds for a consecutive  28-day  period  of  time.
       Moreover, paragraph 1A(ca)(i) of Appendix C states that the  Tier  4
       Migrant must confirm that the funds she  is  required  to  have  are
       available in the manner  specified  in  paragraph  13  of  the  same
       Appendix. It is clear to me that the focus in  these  provisions  is
       upon the funds held by the relevant PBS migrant, in this  case,  the
       1st Appellant. This is a requirement in addition to the requirements
       identified in Appendix E.

   19. I am further fortified in my conclusion by  reference  to  paragraph
       1A(g) of Appendix C. This reads,

           Where the application is made at the same time as applications
           by the partner or child of the applicant (such that the
           applicant is a Relevant Points Based System Migrant for the
           purposes of paragraph 319AA), each applicant must have the total
           requisite funds specified in the relevant parts of appendices C
           and E. If each applicant does not individually meet the
           requirements of appendices C and / or E, as appropriate, all the
           applications (the application by the Relevant Points Based
           System Migrant and applications as the partner or child of that
           relevant Points Based system Migrant) will be refused.

   20. This paragraph indicates that the relevant PBS migrant must
       individually meet the requirements of Appendix C. The clear words of
       Appendix C indicates that the funds available to the relevant PBS
       migrant can only be provided by reference, inter alia, to her own
       bank statement or a joint bank statement, or her parents or legal
       guardian's bank statements. The implicit exclusion of a spouse's
       bank account statement cannot be undermined by reference to Appendix
       E.

   21. For these reasons I am not satisfied that Appendix C and Appendix E
       can be read conjunctively in the sense advanced by the Appellants. I
       am not satisfied, applying Mahad, that the rules could be read in
       any other way, or that the requirements themselves are in any way
       irrational to the extent that they potentially exclude funds from a
       sponsor that are not held in a joint bank account.

   22. The Appellants additionally argue that the Judge failed to consider
       whether the Respondent acted unlawfully in failing to exercise her
       discretion under paragraph 245AA of the immigration rules or the
       evidential flexibility policy.

   23. With respect to the existence of a separate evidential flexibility
       policy, the Upper Tribunal in Durrani (Entrepreneurs: bank letters;
       evidential flexibility) [2014] UKUT 00295 (IAC) stated that, "There
       is no evidence that some policy on evidential flexibility,
       independent and freestanding of paragraph 245AA, survived the
       introduction of that paragraph in the immigration rules."

   24. I must therefore consider whether the Respondent acted unlawfully in
       respect of any duty imposed on her by paragraph 245AA of the
       immigration rules, as it was at the date of the Respondent's
       decision.





           Paragraph 245AA(b) read:


                 (b) If the applicant has submitted specified documents in
                 which:
                 (i) Some of the documents in a sequence have been omitted
                 (for example, if one bank statement from a series is
                 missing);
                 (ii) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if a
                 letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or
                 (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or


                 (iv) A document does not contain all of the specified
                 information;
                 the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the
                 Secretary of State may contact the applicant or his
                 representative in writing, and request the correct
                 documents.

   25. This paragraph cannot apply to the 1st Appellant. There are no
       missing documents within a sequence, or a document in the wrong
       format, or a copy rather than an original. Nor can it reasonably be
       said that the failure to provide a bank statement containing the
       requisite funds, as specified in Appendix C, constitutes a document
       that does not contain all of the specified information. I do not
       regard a failure to prove the required level of funds by reference
       to paragraph 13 of Appendix C as being comparable in any way to a
       situation where a document does not contain all of the specified
       information. There is no merit in this ground.

   26. The Appellants also seek to rely on CDS (PBS "available" Article 8)
       Brazil [2010] UKUT 305 (IAC). The first headnote to this authority
       states,

           Funds are "available" to a claimant at the material time if they
           belong to a third party but that party is shown to be willing to
           deploy them to support the claimant for the purpose
           contemplated.

   27. The Appellant contend that, as the 2nd Appellant held funds in his
       bank account, and provided a copy of that bank account to the
       Respondent in support of the application, he thereby demonstrated a
       willingness to support the 1st Appellant's application and the those
       funds were consequently available to her.

   28. At the date of the decision under appeal in CDS paragraph 13 of
       Appendix C read,

           Guidance published by the United Kingdom Border Agency will set
           out when funds will be considered to be available to an
           applicant, including the circumstances in which the money must
           be that of the applicant and the extent to which a sponsorship
           arrangement that provides the required funds will suffice.

   29. The Guidance was not of course incorporated within the immigration
       rules and, following first the authorities of Pankina (Secretary of
       State for the Home Department v Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 719), and
       then Alvi, (R (on the application of Alvi) (Respondent) v Secretary
       of State for the Home Department (Appellant) [2012] UKSC 33) the
       Upper Tribunal were more at liberty to assess the definition of
       'available to'.

   30. Paragraph 13 of Appendix C, in its manifestation as of 16 January
       2014, the date of the decision that is the subject of this appeal,
       was much more restrictive as to the sources and forms of evidence
       the Respondent would consider when assessing whether the requisite
       funds were 'available' to an applicant. Paragraph 13 of CDS itself
       reads,

           In the absence of specific additional requirements of the
           Immigration Rules, it seems to us that funds are "available" to
           a claimant at the material time if they belong to a third party
           but that party is shown to be willing to deploy them to support
           the claimant for the purpose contemplated.

   31. It is clear to me that the Upper Tribunal contemplated the
       possibility that the immigration rules could impose specific
       requirements in respect of the availability of funds for the
       purposes of Appendix C. This is precisely what the Secretary of
       State has done. Paragraph 13 of Appendix C at the date of decision
       did have specific additional requirements that were absent from the
       version when CDS was decided. I do not therefore find this authority
       of assistance when considering the meaning of the term 'available
       to' in the context of the present appeal.

   32. For the reasons I have given above I am not satisfied the FtT Judge
       made a material error of law and I dismiss the appeal.

          Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law. The appeal is dismissed.
