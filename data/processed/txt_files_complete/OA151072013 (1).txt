                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW
                               AND DIRECTIONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan date of birth 27th  June  2013.
    She appeals with permission the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    M. Davies to dismiss her appeal against the  Respondent's  decision  of
    the 27th June 2013 to refuse to issue her with entry clearance  as  the
    spouse of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom.






    Background and Matters in Issue

 2. The Sponsor is a Mr Sajjad  Ali,  an  Afghani  who  is  now  a  British
    national. Mr Ali arrived in the United  Kingdom  in  2001  and  claimed
    asylum.  In the course of that claim he declared that  he  was  married
    with three children.  He was refused asylum but remained in the UK  and
    eventually gained indefinite leave under the 'legacy' programme.

 3. In 2011 he travelled to  Pakistan  and  married  the  Appellant,  whose
    origins are from Afghanistan but is now resident in Quetta. She made an
    application for entry clearance  as  a  spouse.   In  support  of  that
    application the Appellant submitted what  purported  to  be  a  divorce
    certificate relating to Mr Ali and his first wife. On the  16th  August
    2011 the application was refused.  The  ECO  acknowledged  the  divorce
    certificate but since it had not been issued by the Union  Council  was
    not satisfied that it demonstrated a lawful dissolution of marriage; as
    such the Sponsor was still married to his first wife and was  not  free
    to marry the Appellant. The ECO considered that the marriage contracted
    on the 16th August 2011 was not valid.

 4. On appeal to the First-tier Tribunal the  evidence  for  the  Appellant
    took an entirely new turn. In a statement dated 7th September  2011  Mr
    Ali said the following:

         "I did not tell the truth when I made a statement in support of  my
         claim [for asylum] in September 2001. I said  I  was  married  with
         three children on the advice of another Afghani who said  it  would
         assist my case. It did nothing of the sort. It was  a  very  stupid
         thing to do but I was naï¿½ve at the time.


         I was granted ILR under the legacy provisions in 2010 and took  the
         opportunity to travel to Pakistan to marry. Recalling  what  I  had
         said nine years earlier, I felt trapped. Out of fear for my  wife's
         situation and frankly not knowing what to do, I eventually  decided
         to try and resolve the problem by approaching  an  Imam  in  Quetta
         through an agent.


         The objective was to secure a document purporting  to  be  from  my
         "wife" stating she divorced me. The name Fatima Ali was made up.  I
         was single when I arrived. I  have  not  married  anyone  else  but
         Hafiza Bibi.  I have no children"

 5. The Appellant herself made  a  statement  stating  that  prior  to  the
    marriage she had been informed by Mr Ali that he had previously lied to
    the British authorities about having a family. She was  upset,  as  was
    her father, but as they satisfied themselves that he had never in  fact
    been married, they proceeded with the marriage. She knew  that  he  had
    obtained some kind of "legal document" which he said would "sort it all
    out" but she did not know that it was a false divorce certificate.


 6. The First-tier Tribunal (Judge Frankish) took an extremely dim view  of
    all this. In his determination dated 23rd February 2012 Judge  Frankish
    had to navigate his "way through a veritable morass of lies", which  he
    numbered as 1)  the  Sponsor  making  an  unfounded  asylum  claim,  2)
    claiming to be married, 3) obtaining a fake  document,  4)  having  the
    fake document attested by an Imam, 5) presenting the fake  document  to
    the Respondent and 6) persuading the  Appellant  to  collude  with  the
    deception.   He found that the Appellant had clearly known that the VAF
    contained deception, having had regard  to  the  inconsistent  evidence
    presented before him. The Appellant claims  to  have  known  about  the
    problem prior to her marriage, whereas the Sponsor's oral evidence  was
    that she knew nothing about it  until  he  completed  the  VAF  on  her
    behalf. Needless to say, Judge Frankish dismissed the appeal.   He  did
    not consider Article 8 to be engaged.

 7. The Upper Tribunal refused permission to appeal.

 8. In March 2013 the Appellant made a new application.  The ECO refused it
    with reference to paragraphs EC-P.1.1(c) and S-EC.1.5 of  Appendix  FM,
    the material part of which reads:
         S-EC.1.5. The exclusion of the applicant from the UK is conducive
         to the public good because, for example, the applicant's conduct
         (including convictions which do not fall within paragraph S-
         EC.1.4.), character, associations, or other reasons, make it
         undesirable to grant them entry clearance.
    The ECO  was  further  not  satisfied  that  this  was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting marriage.

 9. The appeal came before Judge Davies.  The Appellant's case was that she
    and her husband were very sorry for the lie previously  told  but  they
    had now told the truth and that they should be allowed to  be  together
    as this was a genuine marriage. It was  advanced  on  her  behalf  that
    Pakistan was not safe for Hazara Afghans and that  they  would  not  be
    able to live together in Pakistan.


10. Judge Davies found  that  the  Sponsor  and  Appellant  had  both  lied
    previously, and that the evidence about when the Appellant knew of  the
    deception continued to be inconsistent. Judge Davies did not accept the
    Appellant or Sponsor to be credible, and on that basis found that  they
    were not in a genuine or subsisting relationship.   He did  not  accept
    that there were any protection issues  relating  to  Pakistan.   As  to
    Article 8 Dr Thorndike for the Appellant conceded that she did not meet
    the requirements of the Rules. Judge Davies did not consider  that  the
    facts merited consideration of Article 8 "outside of the Rules".

11. The grounds of appeal are that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  making
    credibility findings based on errors of fact, failing to take  relevant
    evidence into account  and  reaching  a  decision  that  was,  overall,
    perverse.  The Respondent opposes the appeal on all grounds.


    Error of Law

12. The grounds of appeal take issue with Judge Davies'  finding  that  the
    Appellant knew  about  the  deception  in  respect  of  the  2011  visa
    application. There is nothing in this.  There may be errors of fact  in
    the way that the evidence is recorded in the determination but  I  have
    read the evidence as it  developed  before  Judge  Frankish  and  Judge
    Davies and it is quite clear that the Appellant and Sponsor have  given
    wholly inconsistent evidence from the outset about what  she  knew  and
    when.   Both Judges found that she knew about the  deception  when  she
    made the application and there is nothing in the decision, evidence nor
    grounds of appeal that leads me  to  interfere  with  that  finding.  I
    proceed on the basis that the Appellant was aware of the  deception  in
    her 2011 VAF.


13. The finding that this is not a genuine and subsisting marriage  is  not
    however sustainable. Paragraph 23 of the determination  states  "taking
    into account the credibility of both the Appellant and Sponsor I do not
    accept that they are in a genuine and subsisting marriage". This  fails
    to take relevant matters into account. There was  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal of telephone contact between the  pair.  There  was
    evidence of enduring association in that the Sponsor has been trying to
    get her into the country for over  three  years.  There  were  detailed
    witness statements and photographs of  the  parties  together.   It  is
    accepted that they  have  entered  into  a  marriage.    None  of  that
    evidence was considered. I therefore set that finding  aside.   On  the
    evidence before me I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities  that
    this is a genuine marriage and that  the  parties  do  intend  to  live
    together.


14. The real issue in this appeal is whether the  Appellant's  conduct  has
    been such that she should be refused entry as Mr Ali's spouse.  At  the
    hearing I pointed out to the parties that this determination  gives  no
    consideration  to  the  central  ground  for  refusal,  the   mandatory
    rejection under paragraph S-EC.1.5.  As I set out above that  paragraph
    provides that  applications  must  be  refused  where  the  applicant's
    presence would not be conducive to the public good.  I enquired  as  to
    whether there was any guidance, specifically in the context of Appendix
    FM, on what that actually meant. Neither Mr McVeety  nor  Dr  Thorndike
    was able to assist but agreed that I could look at any relevant  policy
    guidance or instructions post-hearing. I have done that, and have  been
    unable  to  identify  any  such  material  which  might  assist  me  in
    determining what kind of conduct this provision is directed at.


15. From looking at the preceding parts of the section, it  might  be  said
    that the kind of behaviour liable to attract a mandatory refusal  would
    be very serious indeed: for instance S-EC.1.2 pertains to subjects  who
    have a deportation order in force against them; paragraphs S-EC.1.3-1.4
    are concerned with criminal convictions; S-EC.1.5 with those  who  have
    caused  "serious  harm"  to  others.  This  would  suggest   that   the
    suitability requirements are aimed at those who  have  contravened  our
    laws in a serious way. Conversely S-EC.1.6 provides for  refusal  where
    the applicant has failed without good reason to  attend  an  interview,
    suggesting a rather  less  serious  threshold  for  engagement  of  the
    suitability criteria.

16. The difference for this Appellant must surely be that if she had failed
    on this occasion  because  she  had  not  attended  an  interview,  one
    presumes that  this  would  not  be  cited  against  her  in  a  future
    application: it is however certain that in this instance, paragraph  S-
    EC.1.5 will surely be raised in response to  any  further  application.
    As I pointed out to the  parties,  this  is  very  different  from  the
    previous framework under the Rules. If a party  used  deception  in  an
    application for entry clearance as a spouse under paragraph 281 of  the
    Rules, he or she would be refused with reference to paragraph  320(7A).
    However any future application would not be  tainted  by  the  previous
    application, since the then Rules specifically precluded the Respondent
    from relying upon 320(7B) in spouse applications.

17. This determination does not address any of these issues.  There  is  no
    direction on what "conducive to the public good"  might  mean  in  this
    context, nor any specific findings that the test has been met on  these
    facts.   These omissions go to the heart of the appeal and the decision
    in the appeal must be re-made to that extent.  I will do this following
    a further hearing.

18. The parties are directed to serve skeleton arguments,  authorities  and
    supporting documents  (ie  policy  statements  etc)  dealing  with  the
    following matters:

        i) Does the burden of proof lie on the Respondent to show that  the
           Appellant's exclusion is conducive to the public good?


       ii) Does the Appellant's conduct in this case merit refusal on  this
           ground?

      iii) Does the Appellant have any (arguable) residual Article  8  case
           if the answer to ii) above is yes?




      Decisions

19. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it has been set aside save that the findings  of  the  Tribunal  in
    respect of deception are preserved.


20. The decision is to be re-made before me.
