                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Hands, promulgated following a hearing at  North  Shields  on
        15th October 2012, in which she dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal
        against the direction for his removal to Iran which accompanied the
        refusal of his claim for asylum or any other form of  international
        protection and/or claim to be entitled to remain  on  human  rights
        grounds.


     2. Permission to appeal was granted to the Appellant by Upper Tribunal
        Judge Renton on 20th September 2013 and the matter comes before  me
        for the purposes of a hearing to establish whether Judge Hands made
        legal error(s) material to her decision to dismiss the appeal.


     3. I indicated to the advocates of the  outset  of  the  hearing  that
        having read the documents and the determination a number  of  legal
        errors arise, the key ones of which can be summarised as follows:


     i.   In paragraph 29, finding that there was insufficient  evidence  to
              demonstrate the Appellant was  telling  the  truth  about  his
   identity when           this issue had not been raised by  the  Secretary
   of State in the refusal letter            and the Judge did not  indicate
   to the parties that this was a matter of               concern to her. In
   proceeding       without       giving       the       Appellant        an
   opportunity to  comment  or  produce  evidence  regarding  his  identity,
     following an adjournment if necessary, the Judge committed a procedural
              irregularity sufficient to amount to an error of law.


     ii.  In paragraph 36, in claiming that there was nothing placed  before
   her            which indicated that, even  if  she  took  the  Appellants
   evidence at its                  highest, he would be persecuted in  Iran
   on return or to showing the               Iranian authorities would  have
   an interest in him.  There was an expert           report relating to the
   issue of risk on return and a reading of the                determination
   does  not  indicate  that   the   Judge   properly   engaged   with   the
   country expert or the relevant country guidance case law.


     iii. Again, in paragraph 29, by reference to a  copy  of  the  Facebook
   entry in            finding that the Facebook  exerts  contain  names  of
   people as well as                writing in Farsi that she was  not  able
   to understand, the Judge appears to           have  overlooked  the  fact
   that an English translation was provided in the             supplementary
   bundle which was referred to in submissions.


     iv.  Paragraph 43, the Judge refers to  SB,  a  country  guidance  case
   relating to             risk on return, without making reference  to  the
   more recent decision of BA            [2011] UKUT 36 which examined  risk
   on return and the process at the              airport and SF and others v
   Sweden (Application no. 52007/10) ECtHR            published on 15th  May
   2012 in  which  the  European  Court  of  Human                    Rights
   commented   upon   country   information   relating   to   the    Iranian
   authorities monitoring Internet communications both  within  and  outside
     Iran.


     4. Mr McVeety conceded the errors stating that on his reading  of  the
        determination it was clear the Judge had erred.


     5. I set the determination aside. It was accepted that  the  Appellant
        has not had a fair hearing before the First-tier Tribunal as it  is
        not clear that all the relevant evidence was probably considered by
        the Judge and, on  that  basis,  it  was  accepted  that  the  most
        appropriate way to proceed was for the appeal to be remitted to the
        First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh by a judge other than  Judge
        Hands.


     6. Mr McVeety did not believe that the identity  issue  is  at  large.
        This  shall   remain   the   position   unless   the   Respondent's
        representative   writes   to   the    Tribunal    and    Appellants
        representatives no later than two  weeks  from  the  date  of  this
        hearing putting all on notice that it is.


Decision

     7. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the original Judge. The appeal shall be remitted to
        the First-tier Tribunal  sitting  at  North  Shields  to  be  heard
        afresh.


   Anonymity.


     8. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  I
        continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
