For the Appellant:     Mr J R Neville, instructed by Sehgal & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, who was born on 23 May 1993 and  who  is  a  citizen  of
    India, appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hawden-
    Beal, promulgated on 16 July 2014.  Permission to appeal was granted by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer on 24 September 2014.

 2.  Judge  Hawden-Beal  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against   the
    Secretary of State's decisions of 10 January 2014 refusing to vary  her
    leave to remain and to remove her by way of directions.  The  appellant
    had sought to vary her leave to remain either on  the  basis  of  being
    married to a British citizen (she married Dilbaagh Singh Derewal on  21
    September 2013) and/or because she is the mother of a  British  citizen
    (her son Sahib Singh Derewal was born on 13  September  2013).   In  so
    doing, the appellant  relied  on  the  partner  and  parent  routes  of
    appendix FM to the immigration rules.

 3. In addition, the appellant had sought  to  rely  on  her  rights  under
    articles 3 and 8 of the human rights convention.  She asserted that she
    would not be safe in India because her son had been born when  she  was
    not married.  She relied on her private and family life  rights  as  an
    alternative to her reliance on appendix FM.

 4. The appellant also raised one other issue in her appeal to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  She  asserted  that  she  had  a  derivative  right  of
    residence  under  regulation  15A(4A)  of  the  Immigration   (European
    Economic Area) Regulations  2006  (as  amended)  because  she  was  the
    primary carer of a British citizen child who because of his  young  age
    would have to leave the UK and the combined territories  of  the  Union
    should she be removed to India.

 5. The appellant presented six grounds of appeal.  I take  each  in  turn,
    detailing the relevant submissions  of  Mr  Neville  and  Mr  Smart  as
    relevant.

Ground 1

 6. The first ground is that Judge Hawden-Beal erred in law by  failing  to
    find that she could consider  the  provisions  of  paragraph  EX.1.  of
    appendix FM to the immigration rules.

 7. In paragraph 22 of her determination, Judge Hawden-Beal found  that  it
    was not possible to interpret the immigration status requirements under
    either the partner or  the  parent  route  to  engage  paragraph  EX.1.
    Although she did not cite the reported case, Sabir (Appendix FM -  EX.1
    not free standing) [2014] UKUT 63 (IAC), it is clear that  she  applied
    the principles set out in that case.  In addition,  at  the  hearing  I
    handed down an unreported Upper Tribunal  decision  (IA/18270/2013)  in
    which Upper Tribunal Judge Coker and I had considered  the  immigration
    status requirements in detail  and  where  we  had  reached  a  similar
    conclusion albeit for more detailed reasons.  I gave time to Mr Neville
    and Mr Smart to read that case.  Mr Neville did not concede  the  first
    ground but accepted that he had little left to  argue,  the  points  he
    made in his skeleton argument being ones considered by Judge Coker  and
    myself.

 8. Although I formally rule that the first ground is not made out, this is
    not particularly material to the outcome  of  this  appeal  because  by
    seeking to engage with paragraph EX.1. the  appellant  was  in  essence
    seeking  to  ensure  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  carried   out   a
    proportionality exercise.  As has become clear through recent case  law
    (e.g. Oludoyi [2014] UKUT 539 (IAC)), it  is  incumbent  on  judges  to
    ensure that any protected rights are respected and,  where  it  is  not
    possible to carry out a proportionality exercise within the immigration
    rules, then such an exercise must be carried out outside the  rules  by
    direct reference to article 8 of the human rights convention.

 9. The recent developments in case law  -  which  postdate  Judge  Hawden-
    Beal's determination and from which she could  not  benefit  -  confirm
    that there is no threshold test.  The jurisprudence also explains  that
    a full Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 assessment will not be required  in  every
    case, although it will be necessary to carry  out  the  proportionality
    assessment encompassed by the fourth and fifth  steps  in  cases  where
    private or family life is not disputed.  Mr Neville and Mr  Smart  both
    acknowledged this development.

Ground 2

10. Such considerations move me  to  the  second  ground  of  appeal.   The
    appellant argues that Judge Hawden-Beal erred by finding  at  paragraph
    23 that there was no need to carry out  a  proportionality  assessment.
    She stated in the middle of that paragraph that she was "not  satisfied
    that there are arguably good reasons for  granting  leave  outside  the
    rules which would then lead me to consider the question of whether  the
    decision is proportionate under RAZGAR (2004UKHL27)."

11. On its face, this second ground would appear sound.  However, it  fails
    to take into consideration that, in the four paragraphs after paragraph
    23, Judge Hawden-Beal examines the proportionality of  the  immigration
    decisions.  This is clear from the language she uses  and  the  factors
    she considers.  Although it is unclear why the judge  considered  these
    issues given what she said in paragraph 23, it is nevertheless what she
    did.

12. In paragraph 24, Judge Hawden-Beal found  that  it  was  reasonable  to
    expect the appellant to return to India  to  make  an  entry  clearance
    application through the usual channels.  In  reaching  her  conclusion,
    the judge considered the fact that it would be for the family group  to
    decide whether it was appropriate for the  appellant's  husband  and/or
    son to accompany her.  She took into account the short period  of  time
    the appellant had been in the UK and the fact her husband had  spent  a
    period of some 7 to  8  months  in  India  between  December  2012  and
    December 2013.

13. I have not recorded here the findings  made  by  Judge  Hawden-Beal  in
    relation to the appellant not facing a real risk  of  serious  harm  in
    India or of her being the primary carer of her son.  I will  return  to
    those findings below when I consider other grounds.

14. In paragraph 25, the judge considered the argument that  the  appellant
    would not be able to meet the financial requirements of appendix FM  in
    relation to the partner route because she would be  unable  to  provide
    the  specified  evidence  required  by  appendix  FM-SE.    The   judge
    recognised  that  the  appellant's  arguments   did   not   cover   all
    possibilities and that there were alternatives open to her  to  satisfy
    the immigration rules in an entry clearance application.

15. In paragraph 26,  the  judge  considered  the  impact  the  appellant's
    removal might have on her husband and son.  The appellant claimed  that
    she had become the main carer for her mother-in-law but  Judge  Hawden-
    Beal did not accept  that  because  the  claim  was  not  supported  by
    relevant and reliable evidence.

16. This theme continues in paragraph 27 where  the  judge  recognises  the
    appellant's and her husband's desire that she be allowed to  remain  in
    the  UK.   However,  the  judge  considers  the  public   interest   in
    maintaining effective immigration controls and in the  absence  of  any
    unjustifiably harsh factor that would compel the Secretary of State  to
    vary the appellant's leave  to  remain,  the  judge  found  the  public
    interest outweighed any arguments presented by the appellant.

17. There is nothing in the grounds of appeal or in the submissions made by
    Mr Neville to indicate that  Judge  Hawden-Beal  failed  to  take  into
    consideration any factor that she would have had to  consider  had  she
    formally undertaken a proportionality exercise.

18. Mr Neville did suggest that the  judge  had  failed  to  give  adequate
    reasons, citing that she had not made  any  findings  as  to  the  best
    interests of the appellant's child  or  the  likely  effect  relocation
    might have on the child.  In particular, Mr Neville suggested that  the
    judge failed  to  give  any  consideration  to  the  wellbeing  of  the
    appellant's son should he be separated from his mother for even  a  few
    months.  However, it is clear from the judge's comments in paragraph 24
    that she took into consideration the evidence about the best  interests
    of the child.  The child best interests were to remain in the  care  of
    his parents but it would be for his parents to decide where  he  should
    live at any particular time.  That finding was open to  the  judge  and
    there is nothing wrong in  law  with  it  given  the  limited  evidence
    provided.

19. I conclude that I cannot find an error on a point of law in relation to
    the second ground.  This is because I  find  that  despite  saying  she
    would not do so, Judge Hawden-Beal clearly  carries  out  the  required
    proportionality assessment.  It is sufficiently detailed to  deal  with
    each factor identified by the appellant.  Nothing has been overlooked.

Ground 3

20. I move on to the third ground of appeal.  This is a development of  the
    second ground, looking specifically at whether it was proportionate  to
    expect the appellant to  leave  the  UK  to  make  an  entry  clearance
    application from overseas.  The appellant relies on a number of  cases,
    but as clarified by Mr Neville, her focus is on  the  judgment  of  the
    House of Lords in Chikwamba [2008] 1 WLR 1420.

21. This ground fails because although it identifies one of the key aspects
    of the House of Lord's judgment it does not take into consideration the
    different circumstances of the appellant in that case and the appellant
    in this case.  In that case the only obstacle  to  immigration  control
    was the formality of an entry  clearance  application.   In  this  case
    there is a major obstacle in that there  is  insufficient  evidence  to
    show  that  the  appellant  met  the  financial  requirements  of   the
    immigration rules.

22.  In  addition,  the  immigration  rules  and  statutes   have   changed
    significantly  since  the  House  of  Lord's  judgment  in   terms   of
    strengthening the  weight  to  be  given  to  the  public  interest  in
    maintaining effective immigration control.  The European Court of Human
    Rights has recently confirmed that, "The corollary of a  State's  right
    to control  immigration  is  the  duty  of  aliens  ...  to  submit  to
    immigration controls and procedures and  leave  the  territory  of  the
    Contracting State when so ordered if they are lawfully denied entry  or
    residence." (paragraph 100 of Jeunesse v the  Netherlands  (unreported,
    appl. No. 12738/10, 3 October 2014).

23. In addition to these general points, Mr Neville  argued  that  Baroness
    Hale had said at paragraph 8 of Chikwamba that, "Even if it  would  not
    be disproportionate  to  expect  a  husband  to  ensure  a  few  months
    separation from his wife, it must be disproportionate to expect a  four
    year old girl, who was born and has lived all her life here, either  to
    be separated from her mother for some months  or  to  travel  with  her
    mother to ensure the "harsh and  unpalatable"  conditions  in  Zimbabwe
    simply in order to enforce the entry clearance procedures."  Mr Neville
    argued that the appellant and her son would be in a  similar  situation
    and the judge has failed to carry out  a  proportionality  exercise  by
    referring  to  an  "unduly  harsh"  test  in  paragraph   24   of   her
    determination.

24. This argument fails because Mr Neville has misread what  Judge  Hawden-
    Beal says in paragraph 24.   I  quote  from  the  second  half  of  the
    paragraph, "I  am  satisfied  that  it  is  quite  reasonable  for  the
    appellant to return back to India and apply through the usual  channels
    for entry clearance, whether she takes her son and whether her  husband
    accompanies her is a matter for them, but it is not unjustifiably harsh
    to expect them to do that."  The judge uses similar wording at the  end
    of paragraph 27.

25. Not only is the judge not describing the situation in India as  "unduly
    harsh!" but she is considering what is reasonable.  Reasonableness  and
    proportionality are two sides of the same  coin.   As  I  have  already
    indicated, in terms of article 8 of the human  rights  convention,  the
    determination  shows  that  the   judge   carried   out   an   adequate
    proportionality assessment.

Ground 4

26. The next ground of appeal takes a  different  tack.   It  asserts  that
    Judge  Hawden-Beal  has  not  given  adequate  consideration   of   the
    appellant's submission that she is entitled to a  derivative  right  of
    residence under regulation 15A of the 2006 EEA Regulations.

27. Although there is nothing about EU  law  in  the  original  grounds  of
    appeal, it is clear from the  final  phrase  of  paragraph  24  of  the
    determination that Judge Hawden-Beal was  considering  the  appellant's
    Community rights.  It is accepted that the only possible  arguments  on
    this point were those relating to regulation 15A(4A) as the appellant's
    child is a British citizen.  I therefore reject any argument  that  the
    issue of derivative rights of residence was not before the judge.

28. Regulation 15A(4A) requires:

         Derivative right of residence

         15A. (1) A person ("P")  who  is  not  an  exempt  person  and  who
         satisfies the criteria in paragraph (2), (3), (4), (4A) or  (5)  of
         this regulation is entitled to a derivative right to reside in  the
         United Kingdom for as long as P satisfies the relevant criteria.

         ...

         (4A) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-

             (a) P is the primary carer of a British citizen ("the relevant
             British citizen");

             (b) the relevant British citizen is  residing  in  the  United
             Kingdom; and

             (c) the relevant British citizen would be unable to reside  in
             the UK or in another EEA State if P were required to leave.

         ...

29. The question in relation to this  ground  is  whether  the  judge  made
    adequate findings in relation to regulation 15A(4A).  In the middle  of
    paragraph 24 she observes, "The appellant also claims that she  is  her
    son's main carer.  I would expect that to be the case given his  tender
    years but if she had to leave the UK and return to make an  application
    for entry clearance he would still have his father in the  UK  to  care
    for him."   I am satisfied this is sufficient to engage  with  each  of
    the three points  contained  in  regulation  15A(4A).   Although  Judge
    Hawden-Beal recognised that the appellant is her son's  primary  carer,
    she also recognised that he would be able to reside in the  UK  if  the
    appellant left because of the presence of his father here.

30. I add that in the remainder of paragraph 24 and in paragraph  27  Judge
    Hawden-Beal reflects the proportionality of this decision  and  thereby
    follows not only the requirements of article  8  of  the  human  rights
    convention but also a fundamental principle of EU law.  Although  there
    are some technical differences in the two schemes  of  proportionality,
    those  differences  do  not  apply  here   and   therefore   the   same
    proportionality assessment applies to both legal issues.

31. I conclude that the fourth ground is not made out.  Although  I  accept
    that Judge Hawden-Beal might have made life easier for the  reader  had
    she separated out this issue, her failure to do so does not  give  rise
    to any legal error since her findings are sound on this point.

Ground 5

32.  The  appellant  argues  under  this  heading  that  Judge  Hawden-Beal
    misunderstood the requirements of appendices FM and  FM-SE  insofar  as
    she explains how the appellant could overcome  the  claimed  evidential
    difficulties should her husband accompany her to India.   In  paragraph
    25 of her determination, Judge Hawden-Beal  suggests  a  way  that  the
    appellant could provide the Entry Clearance Officer  with  six  months'
    wage slips for her husband to meet the requirements of appendix  FM-SE.



33. The appellant argues that this proposal  is  absurd  because  it  would
    suggest that the appellant's husband abandons his job and deceives  the
    Entry Clearance Officer.  The appellant's husband  is  employed  by  an
    agency and would be unable to respond to  any  offers  of  work  whilst
    overseas.  In addition, it would require the appellant to  overstay  an
    additional six months.  The appellant also submits that  if  she  meets
    the minimum income  requirements,  then  to  require  her  to  make  an
    application from overseas is to require her to comply with a  formality
    contrary to Chikwamba.

34. The appellant's arguments are  misguided  for  the  following  reasons.
    Judge Hawden-Beal does not make a finding that the appellant  can  meet
    the minimum income requirement.  At the end of paragraph 25 she clearly
    states that she has been shown no evidence to show that the appellant's
    husband earned over the �18,600 threshold.  The judge mentions that the
    appellant's husband had �19,000 in savings and that would be taken into
    account when assessing whether the minimum income requirement  is  met.
    That is as far as her findings go in relation to whether the  appellant
    meets the financial requirements of appendix FM.

35. The allegations made against the other findings are unsustainable.  The
    grounds suggest that the appellant's spouse would have to  abandon  his
    agency work if he returned to India with the appellant.  This fails  to
    take into consideration the nature of  agency  work.   The  appellant's
    husband would be able to advise the agency if he was going  abroad  and
    would not have to leave that employment.  He would  simply  not  accept
    offers of work made whilst absent from the UK.  This is what must  have
    happened when he was out of the UK between December 2012  and  December
    2013 since he retained his employment despite being overseas.

36. As to the issue of the appellant having to overstay for a  further  six
    months, the argument fails  to  take  account  of  the  fact  that  the
    appellant and her husband have been in the UK for well over six  months
    already and therefore on return to India the  appellant  could  provide
    the necessary wage slips assuming  the  appellant's  husband  has  been
    working during this period.

37. The issue of whether the appellant meets the minimum income requirement
    is not the same issue as whether the immigration  rules  would  prevent
    the appellant making an application for entry clearance by imposing  an
    unfair evidential burden on her.  The rules do not impose such a burden
    and nor do her circumstances.  However,  the  evidence  once  submitted
    will have to be assessed and if the financial requirements are not  met
    then it will be open to the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  refuse  the
    application. This is compatible with human rights law as made clear  by
    the Court of Appeal in MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 895.

38. In his skeleton arguments, Mr Neville adds to the above the  fact  that
    if the appellant cannot  meet  the  financial  requirements,  then  the
    judge's findings about the impact of separation  or  of  living  abroad
    upon her son will be undermined.  This argument is  wrong  in  that  it
    expects the judge to speculate far away from  any  evidence.   It  also
    fails to take into consideration that if the minimum income requirement
    is not met, then there will be human rights reasons to interfere in the
    wishes of the family group to live together in the UK, as discussed  in
    MM (Lebanon).

39. For all these reasons this fifth ground fails.

Ground 6

40. This final ground is a mixture of  complaints  about  paragraph  27  of
    Judge Hawden-Beal's determination.  This ground argues  that  paragraph
    27 is barely coherent and that it conflates asylum with harshness under
    the immigration rules and article 8.  The ground also argues  that  the
    paragraph contains broad sweeping statements about choice of  residence
    and criticises the appellant's claims notwithstanding the fact that the
    judge did not reject the factual matrix made by the appellant about her
    fear of returning to India with her child.  The final criticism is that
    the appellant was ambushed as the issues  were  not  canvassed  at  the
    hearing and the appellant was not given an opportunity to deal with the
    issues raised by the judge.

41. As I pointed out to Mr Neville, this ground is misplaced  for  two  key
    reasons. First, Judge Hawden-Beal dealt with the appellant's protection
    claim in the second half of paragraph 23  of  her  determination.   She
    found that the evidence presented did not show that the appellant had a
    real risk of serious harm or persecution in India.  The judge gave good
    reasons for her findings, based on the very limited evidence presented.
     The argument that the judge failed to make relevant  findings  on  the
    protection issues is unfounded.

42. Secondly, the appellant  was  not  ambushed.   The  grounds  of  appeal
    originally settled by the appellant made clear reference to  protection
    issues and to article 3 in particular.  The judge was required to  deal
    with all grounds of appeal  and  therefore  had  to  make  findings  in
    relation to the protection issues raised.  The fact the  appellant  did
    not provide satisfactory evidence and that she was not called  to  give
    evidence was a decision she took with her legal  representatives.   The
    judge had no  basis  to  intervene  as  to  do  so  would  be  to  step
    impermissibly into the arena.  But she had to  make  findings  on  what
    evidence there was.  It is unsurprising that the evidence was found  to
    be weak.

43. The sixth ground also  alleges  that  the  appellant's  fear  would  go
    towards the question  of  justification  even  if  it  fell  below  the
    threshold for asylum.  Given that the protection issue was assessed  at
    the lower standard and found to be lacking, it would fail at the normal
    civil standard.  Therefore, there is no merit  in  this  argument  that
    relates to  potential  social  stigma  because  there  is  insufficient
    evidence, the appellant's own account being rejected.

44. The only possible criticism in this aspect of the  determination  might
    be that the judge has referred to asylum when the appellant referred to
    article 3.  But as is made clear in vast amounts of case law,  the  two
    are interchangeable in most situations in  respect  of  assessing  real
    risk so any such error would not be material to the outcome.

45. For all these reasons, the sixth ground also fails.

Other issues

46. No other issues were canvassed during the hearing.

Conclusion

47. Given the fact that none of the grounds of  appeal  is  made  out,  the
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal fails and the decision  of  Judge  Hawden-
    Beal is upheld.

Decision

The appellant's appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  dismissed  because  the
determination of Judge Hawden-Beal does not contain an error on a  point  of
law.

                               Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal
