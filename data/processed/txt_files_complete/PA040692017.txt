                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant has been granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  dismissed
    his appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse his  asylum  and
    human rights claim.

2.    The Upper Tribunal has received a fax dated 17 November 2017 from  the
    appellant's representatives indicating that  the  appellant  wishes  to
    withdraw his appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

3.    Rule  17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    provides that a party may give notice of the withdrawal of its case  or
    part of it, subject to the consent of the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  Upper
    Tribunal gives its consents to the withdrawal.

4.    In the circumstances the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    treated as unchallenged.  Accordingly,  the  appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed, with the effect that the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal shall stand in all respects.
