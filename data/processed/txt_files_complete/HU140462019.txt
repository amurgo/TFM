Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Oluwale Adebayo of Counsel, solicitor at David &
Vine Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr Esen Tufan, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission from the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    on 6 August 2019 to refuse him leave to remain in the United Kingdom on
    human rights grounds. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.

 2. Mode of hearing.  The hearing today took place  remotely  by  Microsoft
    Teams.  There were no technical difficulties.  I am satisfied that  all
    parties were in a quiet and private place  and  that  the  hearing  was
    completed fairly, with the cooperation of both representatives.

Background

 3. The appellant has an unedifying immigration history.  He  came  to  the
    United Kingdom from Nigeria on 25 December 2003 on a 2-year visit visa,
    then moved to student visas as a student nurse.  He had valid leave  on
    that basis until 31 October 2008.  He has had no leave since then.

 4. On 31 October 2008, the appellant applied to renew  his  student  visa.
    He was refused, with an in-country right of  appeal  on  which  he  was
    appeal rights exhausted on 18 September 2009.  The  appellant  did  not
    embark for Nigeria, but remained in the United Kingdom without leave.

 5. Over the succeeding years, the appellant made a  total  of  13  further
    applications for leave.  He made six Tier 4 (General)  Student  Migrant
    applications, all of which were refused.  On 31 August 2011, he applied
    for leave to remain outside the Rules, which was refused.  On 28  March
    2012, he made a Tier 1 Highly Skilled Migrant  application,  which  was
    refused.  On 28 March 2012, he also made an application  for  leave  to
    remain on the 10-year private and family life route, which was refused.

 6. During this time, the appellant had begun a relationship with the woman
    who is now his wife, a British citizen of Nigerian  origin.   Fertility
    investigations at a private clinic began in 2012.  The parties  married
    on 24 July 2013.

 7. On 2 October 2013, the appellant made an  Article  8  ECHR  application
    which was  refused  with  an  in-country  right  of  appeal,  which  he
    exercised.  He was appeal rights exhausted on that appeal  on  2  March
    2015.

 8. On 1 May 2015, the appellant made another application  on  the  10-year
    route, which was refused with an in-country right of appeal on which he
    was appeal rights exhausted on 8 January 2019.

 9. In 2018, the  appellant  and  his  wife  began  in-vitro  fertilisation
    treatment to enable them to start  a  family.   On  16  May  2019,  the
    appellant made an application to remain as his wife's spouse, which was
    refused on 6 August 2019.   That is the decision under challenge.

10. In her refusal letter, the respondent accepted that the couple are in a
    genuine and subsisting relationship and that the appellant's wife is  a
    British citizen.  However, she  did  not  consider  that  the  couple's
    attempts to become parents amounted to exceptional circumstances.   The
    only other exceptional circumstances advanced were the  wife's  student
    loan: she is working as a nurse in order to repay it.   The  respondent
    was not satisfied that there would be very significant obstacles in the
    appellant reintegrating in Nigeria, where he still  had  relatives  and
    had lived until he was 21 years old.

11. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.



First-tier Judge O'Keeffe's decision (14 January 2019)

12. First-tier Judge O'Keeffe's decision is the Devaseelan  starting  point
    for this appeal.  That decision was  a  remittal  for  hearing  afresh,
    after an appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The Tribunal accepted that  the
    appellant  and  his  spouse  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting   marital
    relationship and that the appellant met the suitability requirements of
    Appendix FM of the Rules.

13. The question was whether he met the requirements of paragraph  EX.1  of
    that Appendix, that  is  to  say,  whether  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing between  the  parties  outside  the
    United Kingdom.  Paragraph EX.2  defines  insurmountable  obstacles  as
    'very significant difficulties which would be faced by the applicant or
    their partner in continuing their family life together outside  the  UK
    which could not be overcome, or would entail very serious hardship  for
    the applicant or their partner'.

14. Judge O'Keeffe found as a fact that the appellant has his  mother,  two
    sisters and a brother in Nigeria still.  He was  in  contact  with  his
    mother approximately once a month.   His  mother  still  lived  at  the
    address where the appellant lived before coming to the United  Kingdom:
    the judge found that although he would prefer not  to  return  to  live
    there, it was an option for him.

15. The appellant had not worked before leaving Nigeria but he had obtained
    good qualifications in the United Kingdom which would h him get  a  job
    in Nigeria.  The judge found that the appellant would  have  access  to
    family support and accommodation on return.

16. His wife had been born in Nigeria, where she lived  until  she  was  13
    years old and had returned for visits, at least in  November  2017  and
    June 2018.  Her parents in the United Kingdom provided her  brother  in
    Nigeria with some support.  She was working  two  jobs  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

17. The couple had supported themselves without  access  to  public  funds.
    They had been receiving fertility treatment here for at least  7  years
    (that is to  say,  since  2012),  and  were  about  to  begin  in-vitro
    fertilisation treatment at the Zita West Clinic.  They had already paid
    �7000 towards the treatment, which was expected to  take  up  to  three
    months.   Fertility treatment was available in Nigeria:  the  appellant
    asserted that it was very expensive and the success rate was not  good,
    but he had produced no corroborative evidence.

18.  The  judge  found  that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  exacting
    requirements of paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE.   In
    considering the proportionality of return,  the  judge  had  regard  to
    section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (as
    amended) and to the decision of the Court of Appeal  in  TZ  (Pakistan)
    and PG (India) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA
    Civ 1109 at [25] in the judgment of Sir Ernest Ryder, Senior  President
    of Tribunals, with whom Lord Justice Longmore and Lord  Justice  Moylan
    agreed:

         "25. The settled jurisprudence of the ECtHR is that it is likely to
         be only in an exceptional case that article 8  will  necessitate  a
         grant of leave to remain where a non-settled migrant has  commenced
         family life in the UK at a time when his or her immigration  status
         is precarious (see, for example Jeunesse v  Netherlands  (2016)  60
         EHRR 17 at [100] and [114]). That general principle applies to  any
         consideration  of  the  Rules  which  involves  engaging   with   a
         requirement or requirements  that  possess  an  article  8  element
         (often wrongly described as an article 8 consideration  within  the
         Rules) and to the consideration of article  8  outside  the  Rules.
         Where precariousness exists it affects the weight to be attached to
         family life in the balancing exercise. That is  because  article  8
         does not guarantee a right to choose one's  country  of  residence.
         Both the unlawful overstayer and  the  temporary  migrant  have  no
         right to remain  in  the  UK  simply  because  they  enter  into  a
         relationship with  a  British  citizen  during  their  unlawful  or
         temporary stay. The principle was accepted in Agyarko  at  [49]  to
         [54] leading to a statement of general principle at [57]:

             "In general, in cases concerned with precarious family life, a
             very strong or compelling claim is required  to  outweigh  the
             public interest in immigration control.""

19. The judge also considered Chikwamba, as interpreted in Chen, R (on  the
    application  of)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home   Department)
    ((Appendix FM - Chikwamba -  temporary  separation  -  proportionality)
    (IJR) [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC) (24 March 2015)  and Agyarko v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11,   He  was  not  satisfied
    that it was unreasonable to expect the appellant to return  to  Nigeria
    and  make   an   entry   clearance   application   from   there.    The
    proportionality balance was in favour of refusal and he  dismissed  the
    appeal.

First-tier Judge Kainth's decision (21 January 2020)

20. First-tier Judge Kainth also dismissed the appeal.   She  took  as  her
    starting point the earlier decision of First-tier Judge O'Keeffe,  made
    just  a  year  earlier.   She  was  not  satisfied  that   there   were
    insurmountable obstacles to reintegration.  She noted that the parties'
    relationship had begun when  the  appellant's  immigration  status  was
    precarious (in fact, he had no leave at all).

21. The judge concluded her decision thus:

         "42. It is trite law that I  am  precluded  for  [sic]  finding  in
         favour of the appellant on the basis he cannot meet  a  requirement
         of the Immigration Rules. The law requires me to  consider  whether
         his personal circumstances, which include  those  of  other  family
         members, are enough to outweigh the public interest  considerations
         that justify maintaining the decision.

         43.  The fact that I have found that  family  life  exists  is  not
         enough to dispel the public interest considerations.  I must  still
         assess the public interest concerns which are set out in statute.

         44.  There are no exceptional or compelling circumstances  in  this
         case which will outweigh the need for immigration control. "

22. The First-tier Judge dismissed the appeal and the appellant appealed to
    the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

23. Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Judge  Keane  in  the
    following rather generous terms:

         "The grounds amounted to no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
         findings of the judge, an attempt to reargue the  appeal  and  they
         did not disclose an arguable error or errors of law but  for  which
         the outcome of the appeal might have been different.

         I have, however,  considered  the  judge's  decision  in  order  to
         ascertain whether it disclosed  a  Robinson  obvious  concern.   In
         considering whether  there  were  exceptional  circumstances  which
         justified the grant of leave  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  the
         judge arguably should have taken into consideration facts seemingly
         accepted by the judge, namely that the appellant  was  party  to  a
         genuine and subsisting relationship with his spouse (paragraph  9),
         that his spouse is a British citizen  by naturalisation and  midway
         through a nursing course (paragraph 11),  has  a  student  loan  to
         repay and is currently undergoing in-vitro fertilisation  treatment
         (paragraph 2 of the grounds).

         Such were arguably relevant considerations for the  judge  to  take
         into  account  when  deciding  whether  the  appellant  established
         exceptional circumstances and the judge arguably did not take  into
         account  such  considerations   when   finding   that   exceptional
         circumstances were not present.

         At any hearing before the  Upper  Tribunal  the  appellant  by  her
         representatives should be able to establish the factual contentions
         made out at paragraph 2 of the grounds (as to which the  judge  did
         not make explicit findings), namely that the appellant's spouse had
         a student loan to  repay  and  was  currently  undergoing  in-vitro
         fertilisation treatment."

24. Triage orders having been  made,  the  appellant's  solicitor  filed  a
    document headed Further Submissions wherein she  said  that  she  would
    rely on the grounds of appeal and that there were no disputes on issues
    of fact.  The Further Submissions confirm that:

         "5.  The appellant in fact mentioned  the  issue  of  his  spouse's
         indebtedness to the Student Loans Company.  The statement  of  what
         the appellant's spouse owes is enclosed for the  attention  of  the
         Court, for the period of 30  June-13  May  2019  and  she  owes  an
         outstanding of �61469.62.  This is to shed  further  light  on  the
         appellant's and spouse's circumstances."

Rule 24 Reply

25. There was no Rule 24 Reply or response to triage directions  on  behalf
    of the respondent.

26. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

27. There was very little difference in  the  factual  matrix  between  the
    O'Keeffe and Kainth decisions.  The appellant had been able to obtain a
    BSc degree in Communication Systems and Computing, a  course  which  he
    followed at the University  of  West  London  from  2009-2012,  despite
    having no leave to do so, and indeed, no leave to remain  at  all.   It
    was not clear whether he had paid the relevant level of fees.

28. The appellant had been compliant with the restrictions which  his  lack
    of leave imposed, and had signed on regularly, without omission,  since
    2010.  He recognised the need to regularise his  immigration  situation
    and was doing everything in his power to regularise his position, short
    of returning to Nigeria and making a proper out of country  application
    for leave to enter as a spouse, or on some other appropriate basis.

29. The wife's student loan repayments were �378 per annum in 2019, or just
    over �1 a day.  She was studying a 3-year nursing degree at  Bucks  New
    University which would be completed in December 2021.

30. Mr Adebayo confirmed that the  couple  had  been  undergoing  privately
    funded fertility treatment for 9 years  now.    In-vitro  fertilisation
    had not continued during the Covid period (February 2020  onwards)  and
    accordingly, there was no new evidence  about  that.   There  had  been
    complications when the treatment began and the couple had not been able
    to continue with it during Covid.   The  appellant's  wife  had  become
    pregnant, presumably naturally, in early 2021,  but  had  unfortunately
    suffered a miscarriage.

31. For the respondent, Mr Tufan relied on AZ (error of law:  jurisdiction;
    PTA practice) [2018] UKUT 245 (IAC) (5 July  2018)  which  allowed  the
    Upper Tribunal to go behind the grant of permission.  As  the  judicial
    headnote states,  that  is  a  power  to  be  exercised  only  in  very
    exceptional cases:  see Practice Direction 3.7.

32. Mr Tufan accepted that the sponsor's income had  now  reached  a  level
    which would enable her to  sponsor  the  appellant  for  entry  as  her
    spouse.

33. Mr Tufan relied on  the  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Younas
    (section 117B (6) (b); Chikwamba; Zambrano) Pakistan  [2020]  UKUT  129
    (IAC) (24 March 2020), and  in  particular,  on  (1)  of  the  judicial
    headnote:

         (1)    An appellant in an Article 8 human rights appeal who  argues
         that there is no public interest in removal because  after  leaving
         the UK he or she will be  granted  entry  clearance  must,  in  all
         cases, address the  relevant  considerations  in  Part  5A  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  ("the  2002  Act")
         including section 117B(1), which stipulates that  "the  maintenance
         of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the  public  interest".
         Reliance on Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 does  not  obviate  the
         need to do this.

34. There was no material error of law  in  this  decision  and  the  Upper
    Tribunal should dismiss the appeal

35. In a brief response,  Mr  Adebayo  said  that  the  fees  paid  by  the
    appellant for his degree were irrelevant.  He had paid  them  privately
    and they had not been an issue in this appeal.  No  evidence  had  been
    given or sought and the Tribunal should disregard this  submission  and
    allow the appeal.

Analysis

36. In granting permission but raising a Robinson obvious issue, First-tier
    Judge Keane erred.  The appellant is not an  unrepresented  person:  he
    has been represented by David  &  Vine  throughout  these  proceedings.
    Further, First-tier Judge Keane does not seem to have had regard to the
    Devaseelan starting point, the O'Keeffe decision.  It was  not  in  the
    bundle, but it is clear that First-tier Judge Kainth was aware of it.

37. The First-tier Judge was entitled to treat the O'Keeffe decision as the
    Devaseelan starting  point.    There  is  no  difference  of  substance
    between the facts in 2019 and those in 2020, save for the  interruption
    of the sponsor's in-vitro fertilisation treatment by the Covid pandemic
    and the pregnancy which resulted in a miscarriage this  year.   I  have
    been provided with a copy of the O'Keeffe decision, which  has  enabled
    me to understand the point from which the present decision is  required
    to start.   I do not seek to go behind the  grant  of  permission,  but
    this is not a strong case for substantive remaking of the  decision  of
    the First-tier Judge.

38. I remind myself of the provisions of section 117B(4)(b) and (5):

         "117B. ...(4) Little weight should be given to-

               a) a private life, or
               b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious."

39. In this appeal, the  entire  relationship  between  the  appellant  and
    sponsor took place when he was in the United Kingdom unlawfully and the
    First-tier Judge was required to give it little  weight.   The  couple,
    despite 9 years of trying,  do  not  have  children  and  are  both  of
    Nigerian origin.  The sponsor's payments on her student  loan  are  not
    onerous and there is no evidence before me as  to  how  that  would  be
    affected should she choose to live with the appellant in Nigeria, where
    they both have family members.

40. It is unsurprising that the outcome of this second appeal was the  same
    as that of Judge O'Keeffe.  Both judges concluded that  there  were  no
    exceptional, compelling or compassionate circumstances for which  leave
    to remain should be given either within or outwith the Rules.

41. The grounds of appeal disclose no properly arguable error of law, still
    less one which would have been material to the outcome of this appeal.

42. The appeal is dismissed.

DECISION

43. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:
    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law
    I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
