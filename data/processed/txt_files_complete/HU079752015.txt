Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The application for permission was made by the Secretary of  State  but
    nonetheless I shall refer to the parties as they were described  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, that is Mr Gomes  as  the  appellant  and  the
    Secretary of State as the respondent.

 2. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cameron  promulgated  a  decision  on  6th
    December 2016 allowing the appellant's appeal under paragraph  276B  of
    the Immigration Rules.  The judge, however,  dismissed  the  appeal  in
    relation to Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE and on Article  8  grounds
    under the European Convention on Human Rights.

 3. The appellant had entered the United Kingdom on 24th August  2005,  and
    with extensions, had uninterrupted leave from 24th  August  2005  until
    11th April 2014 as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  On 5th  April  2014  he
    applied for an EEA residence card but his application  was  refused  on
    29th July 2014.  On 26th August 2014 the appellant applied for leave to
    remain on the basis of family and private life and that application was
    refused by the Secretary of State on 3rd November 2014.  That timing is
    critical.

 4. As the judge recorded at paragraph 21 of his  decision,  the  appellant
    appealed the refusal decision of 3rd November 2014 and  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 4th  June  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hodgkinson
    dismissed the appeal.  Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was
    refused on 2nd September 2015.

 5. The appellant's further application for  indefinite  leave  to  remain,
    this time on the basis of ten years' lawful residence, was  dated  22nd
    September 2015 and stated to have been received by  the  respondent  on
    25th September 2015.  The Secretary of State refused the application on
    2nd October 2015.

 6. The judge rejected the Secretary of State's contention in  her  refusal
    decision dated 2nd October 2015, that the EEA application made  on  5th
    April 2014, which was within the appellant's then extant leave,  should
    be  disregarded.  As  such  the  appellant  had  10  years  lawful  and
    continuous residence.

 7. The judge reasoned at paragraphs 23 and 24:

         "23.     Section 3C of  the  Immigration  Act  1971  sets  out  the
             relevant provisions.  It notes that the section applies  if  a
             person who has limited leave to enter or remain in the  United
             Kingdom applies to the Secretary of State for variation of the
             leave.  But there is  nothing  within  the  Immigration  (EEA)
             Regulations 2006 which would  indicate  that  the  application
             under the EEA regulations would exclude an  appellant  relying
             on section 3C.

         24.      The appellant therefore  did  make  an  application  which
             would engage section 3C.  That application was  determined  on
             29 July 2014 without a right  of  appeal  and  that  therefore
             would become the relevant date.  It is however then  necessary
             to consider paragraph 276B which sets out the requirements for
             long residence."

 8. In the Secretary of State's application for permission to  appeal,  she
    pointed out that the judge had failed to have regard  to  the  guidance
    set out in AS (Ghana) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2016] EWCA Civ 133:

         "21.     It is common ground that there are two regimes potentially
             in play for those in this country who  are  not  UK  citizens.
             The first is that under the 1971 Act which requires a grant of
             leave by the Secretary of State.  The second is that under the
             Free  Movement  of  Citizens  Directive  2004  and  the   2006
             Regulations.  As is perhaps clear from the  discussion  above,
             the question to be asked in each category is different.  Under
             the 1971 Act a person requires leave and if he or she does not
             have it, that person has no status in this country.  Those who
             have status pursuant to a grant of leave may have  that  leave
             extended if an application to vary the leave  is  refused  and
             there is an appeal against the immigration  decision  that  is
             refusing the application [my emphasis].

         22.      The position of those claiming to have EEA rights differs.
              Their rights result from their position and, in the  case  of
             their dependants, the  position  of  the  EEA  citizen.   They
             either have those rights or they do  not  have  those  rights.
             The EEA citizen only has those rights so long  as  he  or  she
             remains a qualified person within regulation  6  of  the  2006
             Regulations.   Although  there  is  provision  for  an  appeal
             against  the  decision  refusing  an  application  under   the
             Regulations, no provision has been made in the Regulations for
             a right to remain in this country pending the exercise of such
             an appeal.

         23.      I do not accept that the  Regulations  and  in  particular
             paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 can be
             construed to mean  that  there  is  a  different  answer.   Mr
             Kannangara's submission that a person 'should' have  a  status
             in effect similar to that given by section 3C of the 1971  Act
             is in effect a submission as to a reform designed to put  such
             a person in a similar position to a person  with  leave  under
             the  1971  Act.   That  process,  however,  is  one  for   the
             legislature  and  not  for  the  court.   In  the   particular
             circumstances  of  this  case  where  the  appeal  under   the
             Regulations was abandoned and it appears that the  appellant's
             right to be in this country as a dependant of an EEA  national
             may have ceased before the divorce in 2011 and thus before his
             application for permanent residence on 16 November  2011,  his
             argument is, in my judgment, without merit.

         24.      It follows from this consideration of  the  Directive  and
             the UK statutes and regulations that  the  appellant  did  not
             have leave to remain at the time he made his  application  via
             the 'private life' route.   It  follows  from  this  that  the
             decision of the  Secretary  of  State  dated  16  August  2013
             refusing that application could not have been  an  immigration
             decision.

         25.      As well as  the  provisions  to  which  I  have  referred,
             paragraph 4(2) of schedule 2 to the 2006 Regulations expressly
             provides that a person who has been issued  with  a  residence
             card shall have no right of appeal under section 82(1) of  the
             2002 Act, and  regulation  19(5)  recognises  the  distinction
             between the right to reside under EU  law  and  the  right  to
             remain under the 1971 Act.  It provides that a person must not
             be removed as a person who does not have or ceases to  have  a
             right under the 2006 Regulations it he has a right  to  remain
             by virtue of leave granted under the 1971 Act."

 9. It was submitted on the basis of the  above  that  there  was  a  clear
    distinction between the right to be in  the  United  Kingdom  which  is
    recognised by the issue of  a  residence  card  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  and  the  right  to  remain,
    where leave is granted under the 1971 Act which is then  also  extended
    under the statute.  The appellant made an  EEA  application  which  was
    unsuccessful.  He did not have a right to be in the United  Kingdom  at
    that time and he did not have existing leave to remain which could have
    been extended after his leave expired on  11th  April  2014.   Although
    overstaying for up to 28 days can be disregarded, and it  would  appear
    that this is how the judge analysed  the  case,  the  appellant's  next
    application under the Immigration Rules and  thereby  the  statute  was
    made on 26th August 2014 and therefore more than four months after  his
    leave had expired.  On that  basis  it  could  not  be  said  that  the
    appellant was lawfully residing in the UK throughout  that  period  and
    his application under 276B must fail.

10. At  the  hearing  before  me  Mr  Karim  submitted  that  there  was  a
    distinction between AS (Ghana) and the appellant's case.  In AS (Ghana)
    it was the appellant who had  status  under  the  EEA  Regulations,  as
    distinct from the present appellant, who had leave as a Tier 4  Student
    and it was the extant leave which should be considered rather than  the
    prospective leave. As such AS (Ghana) had no relevance.

11. In my view, however,  Section  3C  clearly  applies  however  to  those
    applying for variation of leave - not to those  making  an  application
    for a declaration of their rights under the  EEA  Regulations  and  the
    Immigration Act 1971 sets out as follows:-

         'Section 3C     Continuation of leave pending variation decision'

This section applied if -

 a) a person who has limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
    applies to the Secretary of State for variation of the leave,

 b) the application for variation is made before the leave expires, and

 c) the leave expires without the application  for  variation  having  been
    decided

12. It is clear that there must be an application for  variation  of  leave
    and leave stems from and  is  governed  by  the  Immigration  Act.   By
    contrast this applicant did not apply for variation  of  leave  or  for
    leave.  He applied for rights to be declared under the EEA Regulations.
       That is a crucial distinction.

13. The decision of AS (Ghana) does indeed  underline  the  principle  that
    there is a distinction between leave granted under the Immigration  Act
    1971 and residence  by  virtue  of  the  EEA  Regulations.   The  legal
    framework is set out in AS (Ghana) and specifically paragraph 8:

         "8.      Sections 1 and 3 of the Immigration Act provide that leave
             to live, work or settle in the United Kingdom must be obtained
             by those who have no 'right of abode in the  United  Kingdom'.
             Section 3C of the 1971 Act when read with section  4  empowers
             the Secretary of State to vary the leave of those with limited
             leave to enter or remain who apply for variation of the  leave
             before their leave expires.  It provides that in such  a  case
             the leave is 'extended by virtue' of the  section  during  the
             period pending a decision on the application in which an  'in-
             country' appeal  could  be  brought,  the  withdrawal  of  the
             application, or where the applicant leaves the United Kingdom;
             see section 3C(2) and (3).  Section 3C(4) prohibits  a  person
             from making an application for variation of  his  leave  while
             that leave is extended by 'virtue of section' 3C(2).  It  thus
             prohibits a further application to vary after section  3C  has
             started to operate."

14. As set out in AS (Ghana) there is no similar rule to Section 3C  within
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  Rule 15B of
    the EEA Regulations 2006 states only:

         "15B.    Continuation of a right of residence

                (1)    This regulation applies during any period  in  which,
                    but for the effect of regulation 13(4), 14(5), 15(3)  or
                    15A(9), a person ('P') who  is  in  the  United  Kingdom
                    would be entitled  to  reside  here  pursuant  to  these
                    Regulations.

                (2)    Where this regulation applies, any right of residence
                    will (notwithstanding the effect  of  regulation  13(4),
                    14(5), 15(3) or 15A(9)) be deemed to continue during any
                    period in which -

                    (a)      an appeal under regulation 26 could be brought,
                        while  P  is  in  the  United  Kingdom,  against  a
                        relevant decision (ignoring any possibility  of  an
                        appeal out of time with permission); or

                    (b)       an  appeal  under  regulation  26  against   a
                        relevant decision, brought while P is in the United
                        Kingdom, is pending."

15. As set out, 15B only  applies  where  P  is  entitled  to  reside  here
    pursuant to the Regulations.

16. The appellant's leave was granted with  reference  to  the  Immigration
    Rules and thus under the Immigration Act 1971 and expired on 11th April
    2014.   He applied on 5th April 2014 for a residence card  and  thus  a
    declaration of rights under EEA Regulations which was refused  on  29th
    July 2014.  At no point did the appellant have  rights  under  the  EEA
    Regulations and consequently cannot derive  any  source  of  protection
    from those Regulations. He next applied  for  'leave'  on  26th  August
    2014, some four months after his leave had expired.

17. I therefore conclude that there was an error of law made by  the  judge
    in his conclusion at paragraph 23 as cited above.

18. There may be further  considerations  and  findings  to  be  made  with
    respect to paragraphs 276B and 276ADE and indeed  regarding  Article  8
    outside the Rules bearing in mind the findings were made on  the  basis
    that it was found that  the  requirements  under  paragraph  276B  were
    fulfilled.  In view of the nature and extent of the findings to be made
    I remit with the agreement of both Mr Karim and Mr Armstrong the matter
    to the First-tier Tribunal  for a decision on all grounds.



Notice of Decision

The Judge erred materially for the  reasons  identified.  I  set  aside  the
decision  pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals   Courts   and
Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and  extent  of
the findings to be made the matter should  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007 and further to 7.2  (b)
of the Presidential Practice Statement.
