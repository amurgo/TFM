For the Respondent:    No appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge S.D. Lloyd promulgated on 6 December 2017  allowing  the
    appeal of Mr Chen against the refusal of leave to remain  as  a  spouse
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 2. I shall refer to Mr Chen as 'the appellant' as he was before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 3. The issue arises from the provisions of  Appendix  FM.   The  grant  of
    further leave was conditional upon compliance with the requirements  of
    E-LTRP2.1 which is in the following terms

         'The applicant must not be in the UK

         (a)  as a visitor; or

         (b)  with valid leave granted for a period of six  months  or  less
             unless that leave is as a fianc� or proposed civil partner  or
             was granted pending the outcome of  Family  Court  or  divorce
             proceedings.'

 4. The applicant applied as a visitor and he was granted leave to enter as
    a visitor.  Furthermore, in the decision letter, there is reference  to
    the fact that the appellant e-mailed the overseas post stating that  he
    intended to return to Taiwan after his visit to the United Kingdom.  He
    was applying as a visitor, rather than with leave to enter as a fianc�.
     He did in fact marry his partner in the United  Kingdom  on  9  August
    2017 and sought leave to remain as  a  spouse  on  the  basis  of  that
    marriage.

 5. The vignette in his passport, a copy of which I have seen,  shows  that
    he was granted a visit visa in these  terms:  C-VISIT-MARRIAGE/CP,  the
    latter must be a reference to civil partnership.  It  is  not  entirely
    clear to me whether the appellant fell within the categories set out in
    2.1(a) or 2.1(b) of E-LTRP2.1.   However,  the  reference  to  a  visit
    appears to  refer  to  a  visit  visa  and  not  a  fianc�  visa.   The
    distinction is of considerable importance.  A visit visa is  one  which
    prevents an entrant from seeking leave to remain in  another  capacity,
    that is, it cannot be switched.

 6. The Secretary of State has made a policy that if a person comes  in  to
    the United Kingdom as a visitor he may not then apply for further leave
    to remain.  It is clear that the Secretary of State considers  that  to
    do so would be open to abuse by those who have acquired a  foothold  in
    the United Kingdom, and who would then find it  easy  to  extend  their
    temporary leave by making further applications  during  the  course  of
    which their leave would be statutorily extended. There is  a  logic  in
    the Rules preventing visitors from switching to another status if their
    original status was that of a visitor.

 7. I would not regard that  prohibition  against  switching  as  something
    which is wrong in law or in principle.  The judge  however  disregarded
    the prohibition against switching in allowing the appellant's appeal by
    his application of Article 8 of the ECHR.

 8. In addition, the requirements of the Immigration Rules set out  various
    financial requirements which must be met and  those  are  supported  by
    evidential requirements.  The judge accepted that  they  had  not  been
    met.  He did not set out in what respect they were not met.  He  merely
    said in  paragraph  11  of  the  determination  that  pay  slips,  bank
    statements and employment contracts were provided which were consistent
    with the level of earnings claimed in  respect  of  the  sponsor.   The
    judge acknowledged that the financial requirements of the Rules had not
    been 'strictly met' suggesting that they  had  not  been  met.   In  so
    saying, he appears to have considered that it was possible to treat the
    requirements of the Rules as, in some sense, optional.

 9. The judge's justification for this approach was to say that  there  did
    not appear to be any particular benefit in the interests of immigration
    control in not providing the appellant with  leave  to  remain.   I  am
    satisfied that this was  an  error  of  law.   The  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules particularly insofar as they relate to  non-switching
    were an important consideration.  They form  a  central  plank  in  the
    system of immigration control as it applies to visitors.

10. In those circumstances, the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge should be set aside.

11. The appellant was served with a notice of hearing by first  class  post
    on 10 December 2018 and did not appear  before  me  this  morning.   In
    those circumstances I am not able  to  have  heard  argument  from  the
    appellant as to why his appeal should be allowed.  He conceded that  it
    was possible for him  to  return  to  make  an  application  for  entry
    clearance.  The judge was not persuaded that he would not  be  able  to
    live with his family long enough to make a fresh application.  A  fresh
    application could now be made on the basis of his marriage on 9  August
    2017.  He could then put forward all of the evidential requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE dealing with his financial circumstances  and  those  of
    his spouse.

12. There is no sufficient  evidence  to  establish  that  it  would  be  a
    violation of his human rights to make an application in proper form.  I
    have no reason to  believe  that  such  an  application  would  not  be
    successful provided the correct material is  submitted  but  nor  do  I
    consider that it would be unduly onerous for the appellant to apply  in
    due form.  If that application fulfils the requirements  for  leave  to
    enter as a spouse or civil partner then he will  be  granted  leave  to
    enter in that capacity.  If he fails to meet the requirements for leave
    to enter because he has not provided sufficient material  to  establish
    that the requirements have been met, then there is  no  reason  why  he
    should be granted leave to enter on any other  basis,  including  under
    the provisions of the Human Rights Act.

DECISION

      i) I allow the appeal of the Secretary of State.

     ii) I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

    iii) I re-make the decision dismissing the  appellant's  appeal  against
         the Secretary of State's  decision  refusing  his  application  for
         leave to remain.
