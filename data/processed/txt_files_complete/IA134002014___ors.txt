Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr T Melvin a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr A Otchie of counsel instructed by Malik Law Chambers


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department ("the
   Secretary of State"). The respondents are citizens of India. The first
   and second respondents are respectively husband-and-wife and the third
   and fourth dependents are their children aged 16 and 7 ï¿½. Collectively I
   will refer to them as the claimants and individually as the husband, the
   wife, the son and the daughter.

2. The Secretary of State has been given permission to appeal the
   determination of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Wilsher ("the FTTJ") who
   allowed the claimants' appeals against the Secretary of State's decisions
   of 13 June 2013 to refuse the claimants leave to remain in the UK on
   Article 8 human rights grounds. The FTTJ allowed the appeal of the son on
   Immigration grounds and allowed the appeals of the husband wife and
   daughter on the basis that the Secretary of State's decisions were not in
   accordance with the law and should be reconsidered by her.

3. The husband wife and son entered the UK on 18 May 2005 on six-month
   visitor's visas. After these expired on 11 October 2005 they remained
   without leave. The daughter was born in the UK on 19 February 2007. Their
   applications were made on 28 February 2012. They were refused leave to
   remain, which did not attract a right of appeal. Subsequently, 10 March
   2014 the Secretary of State gave removal directions to each of the
   claimants.

4. The FTTJ heard the appeals on 9 October 2014. All parties were
   represented. The husband and wife gave evidence. In paragraph 7 of the
   determination the FTTJ said; "This case therefore turns heavily on the
   question of whether a child who has been living in the UK for seven
   years, without any other complicating factors falls within the Rules
   and/or Article 8 of the ECHR and whether that generates an associated
   right to remain for their parents who have no lawful status under the
   Rules and/or Article 8 ECHR."

5. The FTTJ concluded that in the case of the son he had been in the UK
   since 2005, a period of nine years and that the Secretary of State made
   an incorrect decision in his case when applying the Rules. Given the long
   period of his integration into British life, the educational stage he had
   breached and his advanced age and autonomy the FTTJ found that it would
   not be reasonable to expect him to leave the UK. He satisfied the
   provisions of Rule 276ADE of the Immigration Rules. The position of the
   daughter was in some respects similar. She had lived in the UK for seven
   years but on the facts of her case did not succeed in the same way as the
   son.

6. The Secretary of State applied for and was granted permission to appeal.
   Her grounds submit that the FTTJ erred in law by failing to adopt the
   structured approach to the best interests of the son in the light of the
   judgement of the Court of Appeal in AE (Algeria) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ
   653 and EV (Philippines) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874. No consideration had
   been given to the factors which went against the conclusion as to the
   best interests of the son, in particular the situation of the family as a
   whole who had sought to flout immigration controls and could have no
   legitimate expectation of been given permission to remain in the UK. No
   proper weight had been given to the weighty interests of effective
   immigration control. It would be reasonable for the son to return to
   India with the rest of the family.

7. The husband and wife attended the hearing before me. Mr Otchie submitted
   a skeleton argument and the case of R on the application of Osawemwenze v
   SSHD [2014] EWHC 1564 (Admin).

8. Mr Melvin submitted that none of the claimant had ever had leave to be
   in the UK except for six-month visitor visas for the husband, wife and
   son granted as long ago as May 2005. The husband admitted that his
   intention was to stay in the UK in order to secure better economic
   prospects. The FTTJ had erred in law by failing properly to consider in
   relation to an overall assessment as well as paragraph 276ADE that the
   son was the minor dependent of his parents and should be expected to
   return to India with them and his sister. They would return together as a
   family. AE (Algeria) showed, at paragraph 9, that what was required was a
   structured approach looking at all the relevant factors relating to the
   family as a whole. The FTTJ had considered only the factors in favour of
   the son as an individual. If the son was deprived of a continuing
   education at public expense it was something he had never been entitled
   to in the first place. His father and mother had no right to be here, no
   right to work, no ability to support the children and no right to an
   education for them.

9. Mr Melvin relied on paragraphs 59 to 61 of EV Philippines. The FTTJ had
   failed to take an overall view of the family as a whole. The
   reasonableness test he applied was too narrowly compartmentalised. I was
   asked to find that the FTTJ had made an error of law and to set aside the
   decision which, he submitted, I could re-determine on submissions only
   without the need for an adjournment or further evidence.

10. Mr Otchie relied on his skeleton argument. He submitted that it was a
   clear and careful determination. There was no doubt that the son met the
   requirements of paragraph 276ADE(iv) to which the FTTJ added the point as
   to his autonomy as a person in the light of his age. The FTTJ reached a
   conclusion open to him in the light of the checklist in paragraphs 59 to
   61 of EV Philippines. The FTTJ set out the appropriate test in paragraph
   7 of his determination and then followed the appropriate Razgar step-by-
   step approach.

11. Mr Otchie argued that the conclusion that the son met the requirements
   of the Immigration Rules meant that the Secretary of State's decision,
   which did not address this, was not in accordance with the law. I was
   referred to paragraph 30 of Osawemwenze. The children should not be
   blamed for the sins of their parents. They were fully integrated into UK
   society. There had been delay by the Secretary of State in issuing
   removal directions.

12. Mr Otchie submitted that there was no material error of law. In reply
   to my question as to what action he would ask me to take if I found that
   there was a material error, he argued that the appeal should go back to
   the First-Tier Tribunal. The claimants would wish to call oral evidence
   from the son and the daughter and further evidence from the father and
   mother as to what their position would be if they returned to India.
   Further submissions would also be required.

13. In his reply, Mr Melvin submitted that the seven-year concession in
   DP596 had ceased to exist. The son's appeal was interdependent with that
   of his father and mother. The FTTJ had made no findings as to the
   Secretary of State's case. The FTTJ had cherry picked only parts of the
   evidence which benefited the son without any adequate consideration of
   the public interest.

14. I reserved my determination.


15. In paragraph 9 of the AE Algeria Maurice Kay LJ said;


      "9. ...... What was required was a structured approach with the best
      interests of Maya and her siblings as a primary consideration but with
      careful consideration also of factors pointing the other way. Such
      factors include but are not limited to the overstaying of the children
      and their mother and the illegal entry and bogus asylum claim of the
      appellant father. The latter is no doubt what the UT had in mind when
      referring to "the need to maintain immigration control". Moreover, I
      do not consider that it would be inappropriate for the future cost and
      duration of Maya's treatment and care in this country to play a part
      in the balancing exercise as matters relating to the economic
      wellbeing of this country, given the strains on the public
      finances....."


16. In paragraphs 58 to 61 of EV Philippines Lewison LJ said;
      "58. In my judgment, therefore, the assessment of the best interests
      of the children must be made on the basis that the facts are as they
      are in the real world. If one parent has no right to remain, but the
      other parent does, that is the background against which the assessment
      is conducted. If neither parent has the right to remain, then that is
      the background against which the assessment is conducted. Thus the
      ultimate question will be: is it reasonable to expect the child to
      follow the parent with no right to remain to the country of origin?
      59. On the facts of ZH it was not reasonable to expect the children to
      follow their mother to Tanzania, not least because the family would be
      separated and the children would be deprived of the right to grow up
      in the country of which they were citizens.
      60. That is a long way from the facts of our case. In our case none of
      the family is a British citizen. None has the right to remain in this
      country. If the mother is removed, the father has no independent right
      to remain. If the parents are removed, then it is entirely reasonable
      to expect the children to go with them. As the immigration judge found
      it is obviously in their best interests to remain with their parents.
      Although it is, of course a question of fact for the tribunal, I
      cannot see that the desirability of being educated at public expense
      in the UK can outweigh the benefit to the children of remaining with
      their parents. Just as we cannot provide medical treatment for the
      world, so we cannot educate the world.
      61. In fact the immigration judge weighed the best interests of the
      children as a primary consideration, and set against it the economic
      well-being of the country. As Maurice Kay LJ pointed out in AE
      (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ
      653 at [9] in conducting that exercise it would have been appropriate
      to consider the cost to the public purse in providing education to
      these children. In fact that was not something that the immigration
      judge explicitly considered. If anything, therefore, the immigration
      judge adopted an approach too favourable to the appellant.
17. Mr Otchie relied on paragraph 30 of Osawemwenze in which Andrew Thomas
   QC sitting as a High Court judge said;
      "30. Baroness Hale held (at para 18) that the starting point is the
      right of all states to control the entry and residence of aliens.
      Thereafter, the factors to be taken into account include: the length
      of the applicant's stay in the country from which he is to be
      expelled; the nationalities of the various persons concerned; the
      applicant's family situation, such as the length of the marriage;
      whether family life was established knowing of the precariousness of
      the immigration situation; the ages of any children concerned; and the
      seriousness of the difficulties which the family is likely to
      encounter in the country to which the Appellant is to be expelled. The
      Court should take into account the fact that the situation is not one
      of the child's own making. Their interests are a primary
      consideration, but they are not paramount (see para 25)."
18. I find that the FTTJ erred in law by failing to adopt a structured
   approach which considered the position and best interests of the son not
   just in isolation but also in the context of the family as a whole. In
   substance what the FTTJ did was to consider the best interests of the son
   and whether he satisfied the provisions of paragraph 276ADE of the
   Immigration Rules in isolation from the circumstances of the rest of the
   family. Paragraph 276ADE includes a test as to whether "it would not be
   reasonable to expect the applicant to leave the UK". The FTTJ addressed
   that reasonableness test in the context of the son on his own and not in
   the context of the position of the rest of the family. The best case for
   any member of the family was that of the son, followed by the daughter
   with the strongest factors pointing towards the removal of the husband
   and the wife. AE Algeria and EV Philippines provide clear indications of
   the need for this structured and holistic approach. I can find nothing in
   Osawemwenze to indicate that any different approach should be taken.


19. In paragraph 11 the FTTJ said; "I therefore think that the claims are
   very much interlinked and that my finding in relation to the third
   appellant may impact upon the overall assessment of the other appeals". I
   find this to be a clear indication that the FTTJ made an assessment of
   the son's position and reached a conclusion before making an assessment
   of the position of all the members of the family. I find this to be a
   material error of law.


20. Mr Otchie submitted that if I found there to be a material error of law
   and set aside the decision then the appeal should be re-determined in the
   First-Tier Tribunal so that the claimants could produce further and
   updated evidence and make further submissions. Whilst I have reservations
   as to the need for further evidence I am prepared to give the claimant's
   the benefit of the doubt.


21. Whilst I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction I note that
   the FTTJ did so. I consider that an anonymity direction is necessary in
   order to protect the interests of the children. I make an order under
   rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 prohibiting
   the disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead members of the
   public to identify any of the claimants.


22. Having found that there is a material error of law I set aside the
   decision of the FTTJ and direct that the decision be remade in the First-
   Tier Tribunal.
