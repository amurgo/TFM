Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr Bandegani, Counsel, instructed by Brent Law Centre
For the Respondent: Mrs Holmes (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, born October 8, 1950,  is  a  citizen  of  Nigeria.  The
    appellant entered the United Kingdom as a visitor on January  17,  2012
    for six months. On June 11, 2012 she made an application  to  vary  her
    leave to enter or remain on the basis  of  her  relationship  with  her
    daughter but  the  respondent  refused  this  application  and  took  a
    decision to remove under section 47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  and  on  April  7,
    2014 and July 16, 2014 Judge  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Easterman
    (hereinafter referred to  as  the  "FtTJ")  heard  her  appeal  and  in
    determination promulgated on August 22, 2014 he refused her  claim  for
    asylum, humanitarian protection and under the Human Rights Convention.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on  September  2,  2014  and  on
    October  3,  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Osborne   gave
    permission to appeal on the basis the FtTJ may have  erred  firstly  by
    hearing the appellant's asylum appeal when  a  decision  had  not  been
    taken by respondent and secondly, by not giving proper consideration to
    the issue of relocation.

 4. The appellant was in attendance at the hearing.

PRELIMINARY ISSUES

 5. Mr Bandegani accepted the FtTJ had not erred:


        a.  By  hearing  the  appellant's  asylum/humanitarian   protection
           claims.


        b. In refusing the appellant's article 8 claim.


 6. Mr Bandegani indicated that he would be  arguing  the  FtTJ  had  erred
    because his approach to the issue of internal relocation was flawed.


SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR OF LAW

 7. Mr Bandegani adopted the grounds of appeal in so far as they were still
    relevant and submitted:


        a. The FtTJ in a detailed determination found the appellant and her
           daughter to be credible witnesses in various paragraphs  of  his
           determination.


        b.  The  respondent's  behaviour  during  these   proceedings   was
           disgraceful and this was a matter  recognised  by  the  FtTJ  at
           paragraphs [100] to [102] of his determination.


        c. Due to the respondent's behaviour the appellant was  only  aware
           of the respondent's response to her case  after  she  had  given
           evidence.


        d. The FTTJ made factual errors  and  in  particular  he  erred  by
           finding:


             i. The appellant could return to live in Port Harcourt when she
                had never lived there.


            ii. The appellant's husband church was not active in Ibadan. New
                evidence confirms that there are at least  ten  branches  of
                the church in Ibadan alone.  The respondent also refused  to
                engage and failed to bring to the  FtTJ's  attention  policy
                document on relocation. Even though  the  evidence  was  not
                before the FtTJ it is arguable there would be unfairness  if
                the evidence as not taken into account following  the  Upper
                Tribunal decision in MM Unfairness; E & R) Sudan [2014] UKUT
                00105. His finding at paragraph [115] is unsustainable.


           iii. The appellant could live with family when her  evidence  was
                she was unable to and he had found  her  to  be  a  credible
                witness.


            iv. Failed to have regard to what happened  to  the  appellant's
                sister in Nigeria as it was relevant to the risk  on  return
                for the appellant.


        e. The FtTJ's assessment of risk on return was defective as he  did
           not give full consideration to whether returning  the  appellant
           would be unduly harsh. The  FtTJ  only  considered  her  medical
           condition when assessing whether it would  be  unduly  harsh  to
           return her and fails to state why relocation elsewhere would  be
           reasonable.


 8. Mrs Holmes opposed the grounds of appeal and submitted:

        a. The determination was detailed and considered  and  all  of  the
           findings were reasoned and open to him.


        b. Whilst the FtTJ may have inadvertently referred to Port Harcourt
           this did not  alter  his  findings  that  it  was  open  to  the
           appellant to return and live in Nigeria with  family  regardless
           of where the family lived or elsewhere. At paragraph  [116]  the
           FtTJ commented the appellant was able to live  with  her  sister
           and brother-in-law without suffering any problems. The  fact  he
           may have mistakenly mentioned Port Harcourt did  not  alter  his
           finding she was able to live elsewhere safely and out  of  reach
           of her husband.


        c. The FtTJ dealt with the  case  on  the  evidence  and  facts  as
           presented. The findings he made about the expert's  evidence  in
           paragraph [115] were open to him on the evidence he  had  before
           him.


        d. There is no evidence that the appellant was  mendacious  because
           the FtTJ accepted her account and the expert failed  to  provide
           evidence that demonstrated the appellant's husband was likely to
           trouble her where her sister  lived.  The  case  of  MM  has  no
           bearing on the facts of this case.


        e. The FtTJ was entitled to find she could return and live with her
           sister and her brother-in-law.


        f. The FtTJ's findings in paragraphs [126] to [127] were again open
           to him because he was  considering  whether  the  appellant  had
           suffered persecution or would if returned. He was not  concerned
           with any problems the appellant's sister may have had.


        g. The general submissions on special care to be taken  in  certain
           gender cases apply to any case. However,  the  FtTJ  made  clear
           findings that the appellant could return  to  where  her  sister
           lived and where she had other family. The fact he found  her  to
           be an honest witness about certain aspects of  her  account  did
           not extend to her claim about the reach her husband may have, as
           evidenced by his findings in paragraph [116].


 9. Mr Bandegani responded to these submissions and stated:


        a. The FtTJ mistakenly referred to Port Harcourt and this must be a
           material error as they are different locations.


        b. The new evidence demonstrates that Ibadan is a place  where  the
           church does have a strong presence. Her evidence  was  she  only
           stayed there for  a  few  weeks  and  left  when  there  was  no
           possibility living there permanently with other family members.


        c. She is unable to live with any family because one daughter lives
           in a house owned by her ex husband and the other  two  daughters
           live together  and  one  of  those  daughters  also  thinks  the
           appellant  is  a  witch.   The   appellant's   sister   suffered
           persecution for being suspected of being a witch and so it would
           be unsafe for her to return to a  place  where  the  father  had
           connections.


10. Having heard their submissions I reserved my decision.  I  agreed  with
    the representatives that in the event I found an error in law  I  would
    bring the matter before me  for  possible  oral  evidence  and  further
    submissions in light of the fact the  FtTJ  was  unrepresented  at  the
    original hearing.



ASSESMENT OF ERROR OF LAW

11. When the grounds of appeal were submitted  on  September  2,  2014  the
    appellant submitted:


        a. The FtTJ erred in failing to take into account  the  appellant's
           health problems for the purpose of paragraph 317 HC 395.


        b. The FtTJ acted unfairly by dealing with the  appellant's  asylum
           claim when the respondent had failed to make a decision herself.


        c. The FtTJ accepted the appellant fell into the Refugee Convention
           but then drew a distinction between the appellant's accusers and
           others and this amounted to  a  material  error  because  it  is
           accepted that those labelled witches face persecution.


        d. The FtTJ failed to properly consider the influence and reach  of
           the Pentecostal fellowship of Nigeria and other churches have.


        e. The FtTJ was wrong to find the appellant could  safely  live  in
           Nigeria with her sister because it was the appellant's case that
           she was unable to do so.


        f. The FtTJ erred by finding  the  appellant  once  lived  in  Port
           Harcourt because the sister lived in Ibadan  and  the  appellant
           only stayed with her for five weeks.


        g. The FtTJ erred by not having regard to  her  accuser's  previous
           conduct.


12. Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal Osborne considered those  grounds  and
    in paragraph [3] of his grant of permission he found it was arguable


        a. The FtTJ had erred by hearing her  asylum  claim  prior  to  the
           respondent making a decision about it.


        b. The FtTJ erred by finding the appellant could  go  and  live  in
           Port Harcourt or Ibadan when he had accepted  those  accused  of
           witchcraft in a community were at risk of serious harm.


        c. Although permission was given on these two grounds  all  grounds
           were arguable.


13. At the hearing before me Mr Bandegani accepted the FtTJ was entitled to
    hear the asylum claim as it had been raised in the grounds  of  appeal.
    He accepted the FtTJ would have erred if he had  not  dealt  with  that
    aspect of the claim.


14.  I  have  carefully  considered  the  FtTJ's  determination,  which  is
    extremely detailed and runs to some thirty-two pages.  It  is  apparent
    from the determination that the FtTJ was wholly  unimpressed  with  the
    respondent's behaviour both before and during the hearing. He initially
    heard the appeal on October 2, 2013 and  he  adjourned  the  case  with
    lengthy case-management directions. The matter came back before him  on
    November 29, 2013 and he further adjourned the case as  the  respondent
    had not received them and the matter came back before  him  on  January
    21, 2014. He then adjourned the case until April 7, 2014 for a  hearing
    but on that date further directions were issued for a final hearing  on
    June 16, 2014. Due to the respondent's failure  to  co-operate  and  to
    ensure a fair hearing he recorded the respondent's oral submissions and
    then sent them out to the appellant affording  her  an  opportunity  to
    submit either written or oral submissions.


15. The FtTJ ensured the appellant received a fair  hearing  by  adjourning
    matters until such time he felt he had sufficient information from both
    parties  that  would  enable  him  to  make  a  decision.  Whilst   the
    respondent's conduct clearly left a lot to be desired the  FtTJ  cannot
    be criticised for the manner in which he approached this appeal.

16. The FtTJ set out the relevant law in so far as it applied to  the  case
    between paragraphs [20] and [28]. He then set out the evidence and made
    it clear that he took into account all of the  evidence  including  his
    record of proceedings.

17. In setting out the evidence the  FtTJ  referred  to  what  happened  in
    Nigeria right up until the time she returned to the United Kingdom  and
    this included the appellant's account of what  happened  to  her  elder
    sister and how one of her daughter's now believes that she is a  witch.
    He noted her claim that her husband was a well-known man  in  Ado-Ekiti
    and that there is a large fellowship of pastors and that  about  thirty
    churches come under a zonal pastor and that her  husband  was  a  zonal
    pastor. The appellant told the FtTJ that lots of people were  aware  of
    the accusations that had been made against her.

18. The FtTJ also clarified with her why she could  not  live  with  family
    members and she gave the FtTJ reasons why she could not stay  with  any
    family members. She also explained why she felt unable to go  and  live
    in a larger city where she  was  unknown.  At  paragraph  [58]  of  her
    determination the FtTJ referred  to  her  living  with  her  sister  in
    Ibadan.

19. The FtTJ also recorded in detail the  appellant's  daughter's  evidence
    including the fact she corroborated  her  mother's  account  about  her
    father's role and influence as well as her mother's medical condition.

20. At paragraph [66] the FtTJ recorded that the daughter's  brother-in-law
    lived in Port Harcourt and that Port Harcourt was also not a safe place
    for her. He also made reference to what he perceived were the important
    extracts from the eleven pages of submissions.

21. AT paragraphs [79] to [82] he referred to an expert and medical  report
    and made it clear the fact he did not set out all of the  evidence  did
    not mean he had not considered the same.

22. I am satisfied the FtTJ was fully au fait  with  the  elements  of  the
    appellant's claim and had spent a considerable period of time carefully
    setting out the claim. The grounds of appeal do not  challenge  at  all
    his r�sum� of the claim although there  are  some  specific  challenges
    about aspects of  his  assessment.  That  assessment  of  the  evidence
    commences at paragraph [99] and concludes at paragraph [132].

23. The FtTJ made it  clear  at  paragraph  [99]  that  he  considered  the
    appellant's claim against the background evidence  that  the  appellant
    had submitted. He made it clear both he and the appellant were hindered
    by the respondent's behaviour and  he  is  probably  as  blunt  in  his
    criticism of the respondent as I have ever seen in a determination. Due
    the respondent's failing he made it clear that he would  have  to  make
    findings on every element of the appellant's claim.

24. In respect of her asylum and article 3 claims he accepted at  paragraph
    [109] of his determination that  "those  accused  of  witchcraft  in  a
    community in Nigeria are potentially likely to suffer serious harm".

25. It is in paragraphs [110] and [116] that one of Mr Bandegani's  grounds
    is founded because the FtTJ stated the appellant was  able  to  go  and
    live with her brother-in-law. However, it is my understanding that  the
    FtTJ found the appellant's sister lived in Ibadan (see paragraph  [58])
    and her daughter's brother-in-law lived  in  Port  Harcourt  (paragraph
    [66]).

26. Mrs Holmes submission was that even if the FtTJ had erred in mixing  up
    the place names this was not a material error because his  finding  was
    she could go and live in with her sister. I  agree  with  Mrs  Holmes's
    submission on this aspect of the appeal namely that even  if  the  FtTJ
    mixed up the place names this  did  not  make  any  difference  to  his
    finding that she could safely live with the sister she had stayed  with
    for a period of time. Whether that was Ibaban or Port Harcourt made  no
    difference. It was his finding she could live safely  with  her  sister
    that was relevant.

27. At paragraph [111] of his determination the FtTJ  found  there  was  no
    generalised risk to the appellant if she went to live  in  areas  where
    family members lived safely. In assessing whether she could  return  he
    took into account at paragraph [112] her account about  why  she  could
    not live in properties but he  rejected  her  overall  claim  partially
    because he did  not  accept  some  of  the  conclusions  given  by  the
    psychiatric and country experts.

28. The FtTJ accepted at paragraph [116] the  appellant  and  her  daughter
    were "honest" but he did not accept the  additional  evidence  from  Dr
    Hoskins that large swathes of Nigeria were not open to her.

29. The FtTJ was not persuaded that she could  not  live  safely  in  large
    swathes of Nigeria and whilst he may have incorrectly said  her  sister
    lived in Port Harcourt this did not  detract  from  the  point  he  was
    making namely that he found she had lived safely with her sister for  a
    period of time and the family had not  had  to  flee  from  the  father
    because of it. I find any mistake as to the place is  not  material  as
    the FtTJ made it clear with whom he found she had lived safely.

30. At paragraph [117] the FtTJ found that she would be at  risk  from  her
    husband if she stayed in one of  his  properties  or  with  family  who
    perceived her to be at risk but he rejected  her  claim  that  the  she
    would be at risk anywhere else.

31. His finding on that point is not  perverse  or  inconsistent  with  his
    assessment of the expert and background evidence. The fact he found the
    witness and appellant to be credible does not mean that  she  would  be
    unable to return to areas where there was no such risk.

32. Mr Bandegani invited me to find the FtTJ had made a material  error  of
    fact. He sought to adduce new evidence that demonstrated that in Ibadan
    there were a large number of churches connected to  the  same  religion
    the appellant's husband followed. However, this submission  misses  the
    point of the FtTJ's finding namely that there were areas of Nigeria she
    could return to as long  as  those  areas  did  not  contain  the  risk
    identified in paragraph [117] of his determination. It did  not  matter
    if the place was Ibadan or somewhere else  and  the  new  evidence  did
    nothing to alter the FtTJ's finding on  the  evidence.  If  return  was
    solely to a place where his church was active  or  he  lived  then  she
    would be at risk but that is not what the FtTJ concluded in  paragraphs
    [117] or [120]. The FtTJ used a simple example of where she could  live
    and it is that principle I have to consider. The FtTJ was not persuaded
    there was nowhere in Nigeria she could safely live. He found there  was
    support available for her albeit it may not allow her to  live  to  the
    standard she wanted.

33. Mr Bandegani went onto submit that the FtTJ did not consider the  issue
    of internal relocation in the context of whether it was unduly harsh. I
    accept that the FtTJ only refers in paragraph [122] to whether internal
    relocation was unduly harsh but  I  am  satisfied  that  the  FtTJ  had
    concluded generally it was reasonable and not unduly harsh for  her  to
    relocate for the reasons he gave in paragraphs [117] and [121] and that
    in  paragraph  [122]  he  went  onto  consider  whether   her   medical
    circumstances would make a difference. He considered her  circumstances
    and made findings that drew him to  the  conclusion  that  her  medical
    condition would not make relocation  unduly  harsh.  That  finding  was
    clearly open to him.

34. Finally, the fact the sister may also have suffered for being  a  witch
    did not alter his finding that if she returned to an area where he  had
    no influence or was not present she would not experience any problems.

35. This was an extremely carefully prepared determination and  I  find  no
    error in law.



    DECISION


36. There was no material error of law. I uphold the original decision  and
    dismiss all the appeals before me.

37. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order was made in the First-tier Tribunal and I see no reason to  amend
    that Order now.
