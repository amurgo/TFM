                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs A Heller, Michael Rene Immigration Service


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Grant  promulgated  on  5  July  2016
    allowing the appellant's appeal against the decision to refuse to grant
    him leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  permanently  on  the  basis
    that, according to the Secretary of State, he was, putting it  shortly,
    a persistent criminal.

2.   Before us  Mrs  Heller  and  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  Ms
    Fijiwala have agreed that there is an error of law in the determination
    in that the judge does not make it clear what convictions he focused on
    in making his finding and that there is no note of the  evidence  given
    by witnesses who attended to give evidence orally. There is  a  dispute
    between the parties as to what precisely that oral evidence was and  it
    is not clear from the determination what in fact the  judge's  view  of
    that matter was.

3.   We are satisfied that it is  correctly  conceded  on  both  sides  that
    there is an error of law.  We were invited to resubmit the the case  to
    the First-tier Tribunal for the matter to be reheard on the basis  that
    the full findings of fact will have to be reheard  and  we  agree  that
    that is the best course of action.

4.      We are grateful to both parties for their assistance.

Notice of Decision

5.   We accordingly allow the appeal by the Secretary  of  State  and  remit
    the matter to the First-tier Tribunal at the centre  where  the  appeal
    was previously heard for a full rehearing (Judge Grant not compatible).


No anonymity direction is made.

                                          Sitting as an Upper Tribunal Judge
