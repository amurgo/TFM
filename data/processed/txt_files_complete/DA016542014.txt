                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Patrice Wellesley-Cole), sitting at Taylor House on  16
    March, to  an appeal against refusal to revoke a deportation  order  by
    a citizen of Pakistan, born 14 February 1987. Permission to appeal  was
    given in the Upper Tribunal, on the basis that the judge might not have
    given adequate reasons for her conclusions on  paragraph  399A  of  the
    Rules at paragraphs 16 - 18 of her decision.

 2. Paragraph 399A reads as follows:

         399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c)  applies
             if -

          a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most  of
             his life; and

          b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

          c) there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
             into the country to which it is proposed he is deported.

 3. There was no indication in the Home Office cover-sheet (PF1), or in the
    first-tier decision that (a) did not apply to this appellant,  who  had
    arrived here with his mother and sister in 1995. However, as  the  Home
    Office pointed out in their skeleton argument, the  appellant's  mother
    had been granted four years' exceptional leave to remain in  1998,  and
    he himself had last had leave in line with that,  so  ending  in  2002.
    Though his mother and sister had later been given indefinite  leave  to
    remain, and are now British citizens, that would have  been  impossible
    for this appellant, who had been first been sentenced to detention  and
    training, for robbery, in March 2002. It  follows  that  the  appellant
    could not satisfy paragraph 399A (a),  whatever  the  possession  might
    have been on (b) and (c): as Mrs Sood accepted, the draftsman's use  of
    'and' clearly shows that each of these must be satisfied for  the  rule
    to apply.

 4. Later the appellant had received these sentences

          a) two years s.91 detention, for more robbery, in August 2002;

          b) 30 months detention in a young  offenders'  institution  [YOI]
             for attempted robbery, in July 2004;

          c) 3ï¿½ years detention for  robbery  and  violence,  in  September
             2007;

          d) a community order, for battery and possession of a  class  'A'
             drug, in June 2012;

          e) 16 weeks imprisonment, for two more batteries, and  possession
             of a class 'A' drug, including breach of the community  order,
             in August 2012; and finally

          f)  two  years  imprisonment,  suspended  for  two   years,   for
             possession of a class 'A'  drug  with  intent  to  supply,  in
             January 2014.

 5. The background to the sentence at (f) was this: in 2012  the  appellant
    had had a son R with his partner: he already had one son, born in 2001,
    whom he does not see. However, in March  2013  he  was  arrested  on  a
    charge of domestic  violence  towards  his  baby-mother,  and  kept  in
    custody till the following January. No doubt full account was taken  of
    that time in the sentence passed then. These proceedings  ended  in  an
    order by the family court on 9 July 2013, granting guardianship of R to
    his maternal grandmother: the appellant was to have no contact with him
    without her consent.

 6. There was no question in this case of the appellant having a continuing
    relationship with his partner or, following the  order  of  the  family
    court, with R; so he could not satisfy the  requirements  of  paragraph
    399 either. Paragraph 398 did apply to him, as a person sentenced to 12
    months' or more imprisonment; so this was the rule to be applied on his
    application to revoke the deportation order, in  force  but  unenforced
    against him ever since 2007:

         390A. Where paragraph 398  applies  the  Secretary  of  State  will
         consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not,
         it will only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the  public
         interest in maintaining the deportation order will be outweighed by
         other factors.

 7. It follows that the judge was fully justified in dealing with this case
    on the basis that  exceptional  circumstances  were  required  for  the
    appellant's removal under the deportation order not to be proportionate
    to the public interest in that. Mrs Sood  realistically  accepted  that
    this was the position on  the  ground  on  which  permission  had  been
    granted; so, if that were all, the appeal would have to be dismissed.

 8. I was very  grateful  to  Mrs  Sood  for  agreeing  to  represent  this
    appellant for the first time before  me:  he  had  appeared  in  person
    before the judge, and drafted his  own  grounds  of  appeal.  Mrs  Sood
    referred me to the Presidential guidance, which allows the Tribunal  to
    give some latitude  in  such  cases.  She  went  on  to  refer  to  the
    particular desirability  for  the  appellant's  sister  of  having  her
    brother to represent her in marriage business, and for  his  mother  to
    have him with her too. Besides that, there was the  interest  of  R  in
    having a father in this country, especially where, as here, his  mother
    was from a different ethnic group and religion. Mrs Sood  asked  me  to
    grant an adjournment, so that she could put  forward  a  case  for  the
    appellant on grounds amended on these lines.

 9. I am quite  prepared  to  accept  that,  in  a  case  where  article  8
    consideration was at large, these would all have been relevant  points.
    However, I do not think that they even arguably amount  to  exceptional
    circumstances, in a case where it is limited  by  the  clear  words  of
    paragraph 390A: the same conclusion would follow from the  restrictions
    on departing from the Rules, on  the  authorities  since  MF  (Nigeria)
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.

10. That conclusion would also follow from the relevant part of s. 117C  of
    the Immigration Act 2014 :

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a) C has been lawfully resident in  the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b) C is socially and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   C's
             integration into the country to

             which C is proposed to be deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

11. This appellant could not benefit from Exception 1, for the same  reason
    as he is ineligible for consideration under paragraph 399A. Nor, having
    not seen or been in touch with R since his arrest in March 2013,  could
    he benefit from Exception 2. While Mrs Sood put forward reasons why the
    order of the family court was not necessarily  correct  or  final,  she
    found herself unable to argue that the judge should have been wrong  in
    law not to accept it as determining the position on  the  facts  before
    her.

12. The result is that granting an adjournment for amended  grounds  to  be
    put forward would serve no useful purpose, and  so  I  refuse  it.  The
    appellant and his family do however  have  the  satisfaction  that  Mrs
    Sood's intervention has resulted in every possible point in his  favour
    being put forward. If I had had the power in a case  of  this  kind  to
    grant legal aid for counsel only, I should have used it. As I did  not,
    Mrs Sood has acted pro bono, in the best traditions of the Bar.
