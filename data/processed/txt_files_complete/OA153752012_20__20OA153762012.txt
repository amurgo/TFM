For the Appellant:     Mr J Rendle, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms E Martin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.       These joint appeals  come  before  me  following  the  grant  of
      permission on 13 May 2013 by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cruthers  in
      respect of  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Wyman
      dismissing the appeals following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 27 March
      2013.

   2.       The appellants are Turkish nationals and sons  of  the  sponsor,
      Ahmet Yorulmaz. They were born on 23 August 1994 and 21  August  1999.
      Their parents are divorced and the sponsor has remarried. Their mother
      remains in Turkey.  The applications for entry clearance were  refused
      on 25 July  2012  under  paragraph  297.  Previous  applications  were
      refused in January 2011.

 Appeal hearings

   3.       At the hearing before me, I heard submissions from the  parties.
      The sponsor was present and the proceedings were translated to him  by
      an interpreter.

   4.       In a Rule 24 response the Secretary of State accepted  that  the
      judge's findings on maintenance may contain an error of law but argued
      that this was not material as the findings on sole responsibility were
      sustainable.

   5.       For the appellant, Mr Rendle submitted that the judge had failed
      to analyse the nature of  the  responsibility  she  found  was  shared
      between the appellants' mother, father and grandmother;  for  example,
      there was no clarification of who did what. In paragraph 46 the  judge
      referred to reservations with respect to the sponsor's evidence  which
      she stated she would discuss later in the determination  but  no  such
      discussion is apparent. The sponsor's evidence was found  to  be  true
      overall and that included his claim that he had made all the decisions
      on education for the appellants. This was  further  confirmed  by  the
      sponsor's brother's evidence.

   6.       Mr Rendle referred to paragraph  55  of  the  determination  and
      submitted that the  judge  had  applied  a  historic  test  which  was
      contrary to the guidance in TD  (Yemen).  He  submitted  that  it  was
      permissible for sole responsibility to be of a short duration.

   7.       He submitted that there had been a clear error with  respect  to
      maintenance issues in that the sponsor's rental income  had  not  been
      taken into consideration.

   8.       In response Ms Martin submitted that there was no error of  law.
      The sponsor had spent little time with the appellants who had  resided
      with their mother until 18 months ago. The sponsor had chosen to leave
      his sons and come  here  for  his  second  marriage.  The  documentary
      evidence showing his financial support for the  appellants  all  post-
      dated the decision.  The judge had been  entitled  to  find  that  the
      appellants were cared for by their grandmother and not the sponsor who
      had exaggerated his involvement.  With  respect  to  maintenance,  the
      annual income was �8000-�10,000 and there was no breakdown of  monthly
      income however even if the rental income for the three months  between
      April (when it commenced) and the date of the  decision  in  July  was
      considered, the sponsor still did not meet the required threshold. The
      appeals should be dismissed.

   9.       Mr Rendle replied. He pointed to three withdrawals  of  cash  as
      shown in the respondent's bundle which predated  the  application.  He
      also submitted that the criticism of  a  failure  by  the  sponsor  to
      produce information regarding schooling and other activities  did  not
      mean that findings had been  made  as  to  who  did  deal  with  those
      matters.

  10.       At the conclusion of the hearing  I  reserved  my  determination
      which I now give.

Findings and Conclusions

  11.        Two  aspects  of  the  determination  are  criticised  by   the
      appellants. The first concerns the findings on sole responsibility and
      the second that on maintenance although it is  accepted  that  if  the
      first challenge cannot be made out, the second achieves  nothing  even
      if it is successfully established.

  12.       I therefore deal first with the issue  of  sole  responsibility.
      The judge  found  the  sponsor's  evidence  to  be  true  overall  but
      considered there were "a couple of issues" where she believed  he  had
      exaggerated the situation (paragraph 46). Although she states she will
      discuss this later, she has not done  so.  Having  accepted  that  the
      sponsor has  been  financially  supporting  the  children  since  2011
      (paragraphs 54 and 56), that he has custody of the children (paragraph
      54) and that the children have lived with their  paternal  grandmother
      for the last 18 months (paragraph 54), the judge does not accept  that
      the sponsor "has had" sole responsibility for their upbringing. As  Mr
      Rendle pointed out, TD does not support refusal based  on  a  historic
      test. The judge should have considered whether the  sponsor  had  sole
      responsibility at the date of the decision. It is not clear  from  the
      determination  that  she  did  this.  The  judge   also   found   that
      responsibility was shared between the appellants' mother,  father  and
      grandmother but gives no reasons why she  finds  that  the  mother  is
      involved (paragraph 58). An examination of the  findings  as  a  whole
      does not make this clear. This cannot be inferred from the  mere  fact
      that they had previously been living with her.

  13.       The judge finds that it was the sponsor's choice  to  leave  the
      children and come here for his second marriage (paragraph 57). By  the
      very definition of the rules, however,  the  parent  maintaining  sole
      responsibility will have left the child(ren) and come to the UK. I  do
      not see why this has any relevance.

  14.       Contrary to what the judge  found  at  paragraph  57  about  the
      sponsor having  no  involvement  in  the  appellants'  education,  his
      evidence as set out in his witness statement shows he has.  The  judge
      appears to have overlooked this. She has also disregarded the  written
      statement from the sponsor's brother, contained in the  bundle  before
      her.

  15.       These are all errors of law and impact upon the outcome  of  the
      appeal. As such the sole responsibility findings must be set aside.

  16.       With respect to maintenance, the judge plainly erred in  failing
      to  take  account  of  the  sponsor's  additional  rental  income   in
      calculating the monies available to him each month. Whilst this income
      may only have commenced in April 2012, it was three  months  prior  to
      the hearing and she have been factored into the equation.

  17.       At the hearing before me, some calculations were  undertaken  to
      work out the sponsor's income from his self and rent. It appeared from
      those figures that the sponsor met the required threshold  but  having
      examined the papers closely, I  consider  that  the  evidence  of  his
      income is  not  all  that  clear.  The  maintenance  requirement  will
      therefore also have to be properly  considered  and  a  fresh  finding
      shall need to be made. It would be  helpful  if  the  sponsor  was  to
      provide clear evidence of his monthly income and expenditure.  I  also
      note that the tenancy agreement expired in April 2012,  prior  to  the
      date of decision. The sponsor is on  notice  that  accommodation  will
      therefore also be an issue that needs to be considered.

  18.        The  live  issues  shall  therefore  be:  sole  responsibility,
      maintenance and accommodation.

Decision

  19.       The First-tier Tribunal Judge made errors of law such  that  the
      determination is set aside in its entirety except for being  a  record
      of proceedings. The matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  for
      a fresh decision to be made on all issues identified above.
