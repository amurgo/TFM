                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Samina Iqbal sitting at Hatton  Cross
    on 11 September 2017) allowing on Article 8 ECHR  grounds  outside  the
    Rules the claimants' appeals against the decision of the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse to grant them leave to remain on family or private life
    grounds. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an  anonymity  direction,
    and I do not consider that the claimants require  anonymity  for  these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 21  November  2017,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ford  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         (2)  It is arguable that the Tribunal erred in (a) finding that  if
             the first appellant were a female and the primary carer  of  a
             minor child he would have been granted leave  to  remain;  (b)
             apparently accepting that the first  appellant  had  lost  all
             ties to Nigeria, despite his arrival in the UK being in  2011;
             (c) apparently accepting the first appellant was gay, although
             he  had  not  disclosed  this  in  any  previous  applications
             (including as the unmarried partner of a female EEA  national)
             and had only disclosed it at the hearing; (d) concluding  that
             the  first  appellant  was  self-supporting  contrary  to  the
             evidence that he had amassed debts of �23,000 in the UK..

         (3)  It is arguable that these findings were not supported  by  the
             evidence and/or adequate reasoning.

Relevant Background

 3. The claimants, who were appellants  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  are
    nationals of Nigeria.  The first claimant last entered  the  UK  on  16
    March 2011 with entry clearance as a  Tier  4  (General)  partner.   He
    extended his stay as a Tier 1 (highly skilled dependant) partner  until
    4 January 2014.

 4. On 5 November 2013, the first claimant submitted an application for  an
    EEA residence card as the family member of  an  EEA  national  who  was
    exercising Treaty rights in the UK.  The application was  refused,  and
    he lost his appeal against the refusal.  He was appeal-rights exhausted
    as of 23 October 2014.

 5. On 17 November 2014 the first claimant applied for leave to  remain  on
    family and private life grounds, and the second claimant (whose date of
    birth is 27 July 2011) joined  in  his  application  as  his  dependent
    child.  The application was refused with  no  right  of  appeal  on  29
    January 2015.  On  6  October  2015  the  claimants  were  issued  with
    RED.0001 notices.   On  22  October  2015  the  claimants  submitted  a
    statement of additional grounds, which was refused  on  29  March  2016
    with a right of appeal.

 6. It was accepted that the first claimant had a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with the second claimant.  However, Gbemi was not
    a British citizen, nor had she lived in  the  UK  continuously  for  at
    least 7 years immediately preceding the date of application.  Moreover,
    it was reasonable to expect her to leave the UK with him.  She was  not
    at a critical stage of her education, and going  to  Nigeria  with  her
    father at such a young age, where he sole focus in life at  this  point
    was her immediate family, would not have a detrimental effect upon her.
     It was considered to be in her best interests  to  remain  within  the
    family unit, which would not be hindered by way of a family removal.

 7. A decision had been made on whether the  particular  circumstances  set
    out in his application  constituted  exceptional  circumstances  which,
    consistent with the right  to  respect  for  private  and  family  life
    contained in  Article  8  ECHR,  might  warrant  consideration  by  the
    Secretary of State of a grant of leave to remain in the UK outside  the
    requirements of the Rules.   He  stated  that  his  daughter's  mother,
    Temitope Balogun, was the spouse of a  settled  refugee,  and  she  had
    leave to remain in this capacity until 16 October  2014.   However,  he
    had  not  provided  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that  the  mother's
    relationship with his daughter was  genuine  and  subsisting.   He  had
    provided no documentary evidence of this, other than a letter dated  21
    October 2015 from his daughter's school, stating that they  were  aware
    that his ex-partner picked her up on  a  Wednesday,  and  four  undated
    photographs.  The onus was on him to  provide  sufficient  evidence  to
    show that his ex-partner played an active role in the upbringing of his
    daughter.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. Both parties were legally represented before Judge  Iqbal.   The  Judge
    received oral evidence from the first claimant.

 9. In her subsequent decision, the Judge recorded at paragraph  [17]  that
    at the outset both representatives agreed that neither of the claimants
    could satisfy the Immigration Rules under Appendix FM or with reference
    to Rule 276ADE.

10. The Judge went on to consider an Article 8 claim outside the Rules.  At
    paragraph [19], she found that there was family life between the second
    claimant and her birth mother, as there was some  evidence  of  contact
    between them and the first claimant's evidence today was that  she  had
    not attended the hearing because she was ensuring that  their  daughter
    was picked up from school.

11. At paragraphs [24]-[31], the Judge considered the best interests of the
    second claimant.  She held that it was clear that the  parent  who  had
    relevant leave had a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  the
    second claimant, and appeared to have an active role in the  upbringing
    of her child.  It was not suggested  that  the  mother  could  continue
    family life in Nigeria with her child, given her current status and her
    new relationship.  In the circumstances, she found that it was  in  the
    second claimant's best interests to remain in contact with  her  mother
    in the UK.  The Judge continued in paragraphs [32] as follows:

         "I therefore go on to consider matters relevant  to  the  balancing
         act under [sic]  addressing  the  issue  of  proportionality.   The
         following matters were highlighted  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant,
         which I take into account:

         -    The Appellant has no links to Nigeria, his only tie was in the
         form of his mother who had brought him up as a  single  parent  and
         who has now passed.

         -    After a number of years in the United Kingdom he  accepted  he
         was gay.  This would cause a number of difficulties with his day-to-
         day life in Nigeria which would directly affect his daughter as  he
         was not supported by  friends  in  Nigeria  and  they  had  instead
         threatened him for coming out.

         -    He had a very large network of friends in the  LGBT  community
         and support from them in the United Kingdom.

         -    The Appellant had financially supported himself through  loans
         and credit cards after he was not allowed to  work  in  the  United
         Kingdom and unfortunately had built up a debt of �23,530  which  he
         intended to pay when granted  permission  to  work  in  the  United
         Kingdom."

12. At paragraph [35], the Judge said that this was a finely balanced case.
    However, the totality  of  the  claimants'  circumstances  led  her  to
    conclude  that  removal  in  their  case  would   certainly   cause   a
    disproportionate breach of their family and private life.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

13. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Kotas developed  the  arguments  advanced  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  In reply, Ms Fergusson submitted that some of the criticism of
    the  Judge's  line  of  reasoning  was  unfair;  and,  on  a   holistic
    assessment, there were no material errors in the  Judge's  findings  or
    conclusions.

14. Having heard from Ms Fergusson in reply, I ruled that an error  of  law
    was made out.  I gave my reasons for so finding in short form,  and  my
    full reasons are set out below.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

15. As I ruled at the hearing, the main flaw in  the  Judge's  decision  is
    that she failed to grapple with the glaring inconsistency  between,  on
    the one hand, the acceptance by the representative  for  the  claimants
    that Rule 276ADE did not avail  them;  and,  on  the  other  hand,  the
    adoption of a case that the first claimant had no links to Nigeria, and
    that he would face a number of difficulties in his day-to-day  life  in
    Nigeria on account of his homosexuality.

16. The Judge was required to apply the Rules as they stood at the date  of
    the hearing, not the date of decision.  In accepting that  Rule  276ADE
    did not apply, the representative for the claimants  should  have  been
    treated by the Judge as accepting that there were not very  significant
    obstacles to the re-integration of the claimants into life and  society
    in Nigeria.  The Judge should then have directed herself  that  it  was
    not open to the first claimant to perform a volte-face for the purposes
    of an assessment outside the Rules, and in effect  contend  that  there
    were very significant obstacles to his  re-integration  into  life  and
    society in Nigeria on account of his homosexuality and/or on account of
    an alleged total absence of a support network.

17. It is apparent that the Judge's  findings  in  paragraph  [32]  on  the
    difficulties that would be encountered by the first claimant on  return
    to Nigeria had a material bearing on her conclusion that the removal of
    the  claimants  would  be   disproportionate.    Accordingly,   it   is
    unnecessary for me to comment on the other criticisms  of  the  Judge's
    approach which are identified as arguable in the grant  of  permission.
    The decision is clearly vitiated by a material error of law, such  that
    it must be set aside in its entirety and remade.

18. I am also satisfied that the nature of the error made by the  Judge  is
    such that the Secretary of State was deprived of a fair hearing in  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Accordingly, as I ruled at the hearing,  this  is
    an appropriate case for remittal to the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  de
    novo hearing, with none of the findings of fact made by the Judge being
    preserved.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the decision is set aside.

Directions for Future Disposal

This appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at  Hatton  Cross  for  a
fresh hearing before any Judge apart from Judge Iqbal.

None of the findings of fact made by Judge Iqbal shall be preserved.

My time estimate for the fresh hearing is 2 hours.
