For the Respondent:    Mr K Smyth, Counsel instructed by Kesar & Co
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   We shall refer to the Respondent as "the Appellant" as  he  was  before
    the First-tier Tribunal ("the FTT").  He is a citizen of  France.   His
    date of birth is 23 December 1996.  The Appellant appealed against  the
    decision of the Respondent to make a deportation order on 12 June  2017
    under Regulation 23(6)(b) of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 ("the 2016 Regulations").  His appeal was  allowed  by
    FTT Judge Kaler, following a hearing on 30 November 2018 in a  decision
    that was promulgated on 7 December 2018. The  Secretary  of  State  was
    granted permission by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Saffer  on  4  January
    2019.

The background

2.   The Appellant has an appalling criminal  history  as  recorded  by  the
    judge at paragraphs 3 to 7 of the decision.  In short,  between  2  May
    2012 and  23  August  2016  he  amassed  ten  convictions  for  sixteen
    offences, two of which are offences against the person and two  involve
    weapons, including firearms.  On 31 January 2014 he  was  convicted  of
    aggravated burglary of a dwelling with  intent  to  commit  an  assault
    occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH).  These offences were the  trigger
    which led to the Secretary of State making a  deportation  order  ("the
    trigger  offences").  The  Appellant  was  sentenced  to   five   years
    imprisonment for aggravated burglary and two  years  for  ABH,  to  run
    concurrently.  He was aged 17 at the date of sentence and aged 16  when
    the offences were committed.

The decision of the FTT

3.     It was agreed by the parties that the 2016 Regulations apply  to  the
    Appellant and that because of the time that he has been in the  UK,  he
    benefits from  the  highest  level  of  protection  with  reference  to
    Regulation 27 (4).  Thus, a decision  to  remove  him  cannot  be  made
    unless justified on imperative grounds and  public  security.   It  was
    accepted by the Secretary of State that the  Appellant  has  been  here
    since the age of 2.

4.       The judge summarised the details of the  trigger  offences,  having
    regard to the  sentencing  judge's  remarks.   The  FTT  described  the
    offences as "appalling", noting from  the  judge's  sentencing  remarks
    that the Appellant and others entered the home of  the  victim  wearing
    balaclavas and armed with weapons, the Appellant with a gun and one  of
    his accomplices with a Stanley knife.  The Appellant kicked  a  middle-
    aged woman in the face and  she  was  knocked  unconscious.   This  was
    committed in the presence of the victim's 17- year old  daughter.   The
    sentencing judge described "dreadful damage" to the victim's  face  and
    eye and psychological injuries to both the victim  and  daughter.   The
    offence was described by the sentencing  judge  as  extremely  serious.
    The sentencing  judge  considered  two  previous  offences  of  robbery
    committed by the Appellant.  He had  been  given  what  the  sentencing
    judge  described  as  a  chance  with  the  imposition   of   a   youth
    rehabilitation order and latterly a detention and training order.   The
    sentencing judge said that the offence was a category 1 offence because
    of greater harm and  the  higher  culpability  of  the  Appellant.   He
    recorded the only mitigation as "a degree of remorse." He observed that
    had the Appellant been an adult the starting point would  have  been  a
    ten-year sentence.

5.   The Appellant was released on license on 2 August 2016.  On  23  August
    2016 he committed two offences of assaulting police officers.   He  was
    convicted of a third assault on  a  PC  on  5  January  2017.   He  was
    recalled to prison on 23 August 2016 because he failed to  comply  with
    the rules of approved premises.  The Respondent before the  FTT  relied
    on a report prepared by an offending  supervisor  and  his  conclusion;
    namely that the Appellant had not rehabilitated, continued  to  exhibit
    offending  behaviour  and  was  likely  to  reoffend.   The   offending
    supervisor expressed  concerns  that  the  Appellant  was  involved  in
    serious organised crime.  He could not provide a risk  management  plan
    but would be able to manage the risk presented by the Appellant  whilst
    in the community.

6.    Whilst  the  Appellant  was  in  prison  in  2018  there  were   three
    adjudications against  him.    On  4  January  he  was  found  to  have
    assaulted a prisoner.  On  5  May  he  was  found  to  have  obstructed
    officers from performing their duties.  It is  recorded  that  on  this
    occasion he was extremely aggressive and  refused  staff  instructions.
    On 30 June he was found to have damaged property when using a chair  to
    fight another prisoner.  In addition to which  he  was  found  with  an
    improvised weapon.  There were many other incidents involving  violence
    recorded against the Appellant.  These were noted by the judge  in  her
    decision.

7.   The judge heard evidence from the Appellant and his mother.  She  found
    that the Appellant's behaviour  since  the  trigger  offence  had  been
    appalling, that the evidence did not  show  that  he  had  learned  his
    lesson or that he is determined to mend his ways  and  that  there  was
    little prospect of rehabilitation. She expressed  fear  that  he  would
    continue to offend.  She found that the  Secretary  of  State  had  not
    established that the Appellant is a member of a gang  or  that  he  had
    been involved in serious crime.

8.   At [20] the judge turned her attention  to  whether  the  Secretary  of
    State had established imperative grounds of public security.  She found
    that the risk of reoffending was high. She found that the Appellant had
    a propensity to reoffend and that he presents a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to the public  (see  Regulation  27(5)(c)).
    She found that had the Appellant been entitled  to  a  lower  level  of
    protection, namely that under Regulation 27(3) (a relevant decision may
    not be taken in respect of a person with a right of permanent residence
    under Regulation 15 except on serious  grounds  of  public  policy  and
    public security) she would have no doubt that the test would have  been
    satisfied.

9.    At  [23]  the  judge  observed  that  there  is  no  guidance  in  the
    Regulations as to what  is  meant  by  "imperative  grounds  of  public
    security." She directed herself on a number of authorities between [23]
    and [31].  Those authorities are PI  v  Oberb�rgermeisterin  der  Stadt
    Remscheid (Case C-348/09), Land Baden-W�rttemberg v Tsakouridis (Case C-
    145/09), the Opinion of Advocate-General Bot: PI v  Oberb�rgermeisterin
    der Stadt Remscheid (Case C-348/09), KA and Others v  Belgische  Staat
    (Case C-82/16), LG and CC (EEA Regs: residence; imprisonment;  removal)
    Italy [2009] UKAIT 00024, MG and VC (EEA Regulations 2006;  "conducive"
    deportation) Ireland [2006] UKAIT 00053, VP (Italy) v SSHD [2010]  EWCA
    Civ 806; and Jarusevicius (EEA Reg 21 - effect of imprisonment)  [2012]
    UKUT 00120(IAC).

10.  The judge went on to conclude as follows: -

         "32. In all the cases where imperative grounds have been  found  to
             exist relate to offences that disclosed  particularly  serious
             characteristics.  The (sic) include offences concerning issues
             of national security, importing and supplying high  quantities
             of drugs, serious incidents of violence and  systematic  abuse
             of children.

         33.  My assessment  establishes  that  serious  grounds  of  public
             policy and public security have  been  established.   However,
             having taken guidance from the established caselaw (sic), I am
             not satisfied that the higher test of  imperative  grounds  of
             public security have (sic) been made out.  Invading a person's
             home, which is what this Appellant did, is  always  a  serious
             matter and is  particularly  repugnant  to  public  order  and
             assaulting a  woman  in  such  premises  is  deplorable.   His
             behaviour towards this victim and the  other  members  of  the
             public and public servants has been disgusting,  but  it  does
             not establish imperative grounds.   The  Appellant  is  not  a
             terrorist and although he  has  used  a  firearm  to  threaten
             people,  he  has  not  seriously  injured  or  killed  anyone.
             Although  I  fear  that  the  Appellant  may  be  capable   of
             committing more series (sic) offences if he  does  not  change
             his ways and behaviour,  I  do  not  find  that  the  test  of
             imperative grounds has been met."

The grounds of appeal

11.  The grounds are diffuse and insufficiently  particularised.  Mr  Kotas'
    oral submissions  were  more  focussed.  He  asserted  that  the  judge
    misdirected herself and artificially reduced the scope of the  analysis
    of whether there were imperative grounds.  Mr  Kotas  stated  that  the
    judge effectively boxed herself in when assessing  whether  there  were
    imperative grounds.  In support of this he drew our attention  to  [19]
    and [32] of the decision. He submitted that Judge Kaler in her analysis
    was looking for the type of offences that could satisfy the test rather
    than looking at matters in the round. He drew  our  attention  to  [33]
    where the judge said that the Appellant is not a terrorist.

12.      Mr Kotas submitted the offence committed by  the  Appellant  was  a
    serious, violent offence. The judge was  wrong  in  her  assessment  of
    imperative grounds. The assessment does not  do  justice  to  the  very
    serious threat posed by the Appellant. Mr Kotas drew our  attention  to
    parts of the OASys Report to  support  his  assertion  that  the  judge
    vastly understated the risk when  she  concluded,  at  [33],  that  the
    Appellant "may be capable of committing more serious offences ...".  He
    drew our attention to page 7 of the assessment where there  is  a  risk
    assessment expressed as a percentage. He has been assessed at 74%  risk
    of reoffending within one year and 85% within two years.  He  drew  our
    attention to other aspects of the report including page 11 which states
    that the Appellant has  been  moved  to  fourteen  prison  institutions
    during his sentence based on his behaviour  towards  others  or  safety
    concerns. It is recorded that he stated that he always makes the  first
    move with regards to assaulting others.

13.  The author of the OASys assessment concluded that the  Appellant  holds
    underlying beliefs and  attitudes  that  contribute  to  his  offending
    behaviour and that he was unable to show any regret or  compassion  for
    the  victim  of  the  index  offence.   It  also  refers  to   physical
    altercations with prison staff.  At page 33 it is noted that there  are
    concerns about the Appellant's control  and  disruptive  behaviour.  At
    page 34 (R10.3) our attention was drawn to the  author's  consideration
    of when the risk is likely to be greatest and it is recorded that  when
    released into the community the Appellant may  seek  reprisals  against
    rival gang members.  Mr Kotas drew our attention to the  assessment  of
    risk (at page 35) which indicates whilst in custody he presents a  very
    high risk to staff.

14.  Mr Kotas submitted that the judge did not attach sufficient  weight  to
    [33] of the decision letter which indicates that the Appellant has been
    assessed and subject  to  the  highest  level  of  multi-agency  public
    protection arrangements (MAPPA level 3), the purpose of  which  is  the
    protection of the public.  A level 3 assessment indicates  that  he  is
    considered one of the "critical few" and poses an immediate  danger  to
    the public.  There was evidence that the judge did not  make  a  global
    assessment of the risk presented by the Appellant in the context of the
    evidence as a whole.

15.  Mr Smyth made submissions in the context of the Rule 24  response.   He
    argued that the Respondent was attempting to  reargue  the  case.   The
    judge was aware of the risk of reoffending and the future risk posed by
    the Appellant.  She had all material factors in mind.  She did not "box
    herself in" as suggested by Mr Kotas. She applied a  global  assessment
    in the  absence  of  strict  guidance  from  the  higher  courts.   Her
    conclusion was open to her in the absence of irrationality.

Conclusions

16.  At  Regulation  27  thehierarchy  of  levels  of  protection  based  on
    criteria of increasing stringency is set out.[1]  There  is  a  general
    criterion that removal may be justified "on grounds of  public  policy,
    public security  or  public  health".  A  more  specific  criterion  is
    applicable to those with permanent rights of residence. They may not be
    removed  "except  on  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  or   public
    security". The most stringent criterion, applicable to  a  person  "who
    has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of  at  least
    ten years prior to the relevant  decision",  who  may  not  be  removed
    except  on  imperative  grounds  of  public  security".  This  reflects
    paragraph 24[2] of the preamble and Article 28 of  Chapter  V1  of  the
    Directive 2004/38/EC.[3] Neither party referred to the  Directive.  The
    decision of the judge must be considered in the context of  the  rights
    laid down in the  Directive  and  the  protection  against  deportation
    afforded to EEA nationals. "Imperative grounds" is not defined  in  the
    EEA Regulations 2016 or the  directive.  It  may  be  interpreted  more
    widely than threats to the state or  its  institutions,  and  can,  for
    example, include serious criminality, such as drug dealing as  part  of
    an organised group.  See:  Tsakouridis  (European  citizenship)  [2010]
    EUECJ C-145/09. In LG  (Italy)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2008] EWCA Civ 190, the court did not attempt to  lay  down
    definitive guidance recognising that European Law recognises  "an  area
    of discretion" for Member States (Van Duyn v  Home  Office  [1974]  ECR
    1337 para 18); and that the Directive allows for  "imperative  grounds"
    test to be subject to definition by Member States.  The Respondent  did
    not draw our attention to a definition.  The grounds rely on  the  case
    of SSHD v Straszewski [2015] EWCA Civ 1245. It  is  not  clear  whether
    this case was brought to the  attention  of  the  judge.  The  relevant
    paragraphs relied on by the Secretary of State are the following:-

         "22. Our attention was not drawn to any case in which the CJEU  has
             considered  the  kind  of  conduct  that  is  likely   to   be
             sufficiently serious to justify deportation of an EEA national
             who enjoys a permanent right of residence but has not lived in
             the member state concerned for a period of at least ten years.
             Ms Chan did, however, draw our attention to the decision in  I
             v  Oberb�rgermeisterin  der  Stadt  Remscheid,  in  which  the
             claimant had been convicted of  multiple  offences  of  sexual
             abuse, sexual coercion and rape of  a  14  year  old  girl  in
             respect  of  which  he  had  been  sentenced  to   7�   years'
             imprisonment.  The  CJEU  was  asked  to  decide  whether  the
             expression 'imperative grounds of  public  security'  referred
             only to conduct which threatened the  security  of  the  state
             itself, its population and the survival of its institutions or
             was broader in scope.

         23.  In giving its judgment the court emphasised that member states
             retain the freedom to determine  the  requirements  of  public
             policy and public security in accordance with  their  national
             needs, but that the requirements of the Directive  must  still
             be interpreted strictly. Criminal offences which constitute  a
             particularly  serious  threat  to  one  of   the   fundamental
             interests of society or which pose a direct threat to the calm
             and physical security of the population may  fall  within  the
             concept of 'imperative grounds of public security', as long as
             the manner in which such  offences  were  committed  discloses
             particularly serious characteristics. However, the court  also
             emphasised that even then deportation will  not  be  justified
             unless the  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  represents  a
             genuine, present  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
             interests of society, which normally implies  that  he  has  a
             propensity  to  act  in  the  same  way  in  the  future  (see
             paragraphs 17-30).

         24.  ... it is clear, as the court confirmed, that  the  expression
             'imperative grounds of public security' creates a considerably
             stricter test than merely 'serious'  grounds,  but  since  the
             application of the test is  primarily  for  the  member  state
             concerned, which must take into account social  conditions  as
             well as the various factors  to  which  the  Directive  itself
             refers, the question is likely to turn to a  large  extent  on
             the particular facts  of  the  case.  It  would  therefore  be
             unwise, in my view, to attempt to lay down guidelines. In  the
             end,  the  Secretary  of  State  must  give  effect   to   the
             Regulations, which themselves must be interpreted against  the
             background of the right of  free  movement  and  the  need  to
             ensure that derogations from it  are  construed  strictly.  In
             that context it is worth noting that even in a case  where  it
             is  considered  that  removal  is  prima  facie  justified  on
             imperative grounds of public security, the decision-maker must
             consider, among other  things,  whether  the  offender  has  a
             propensity to re-offend in a similar way (judgment,  paragraph
             30)."

17.    We note that the initial decision of the Respondent was based on  the
    Appellant being  entitled  to  the  lowest  level  of  protection.  The
    Secretary of State conceded in a supplementary letter  of  21  November
    2018  that  the  Appellant  was  entitled  to  the  highest  level   of
    protection. The decision does not  assist  with  the  interrelation  of
    imperative other than by reference to Tsakouridis where it was  decided
    by the ECJ that the definition should not be restricted to  attacks  on
    the state but also include serious criminality.

18.  The judge  accepted  that  the  Appellant  presented  a  high  risk  of
    reoffending. She was unarguably wholly aware  of  the  details  of  the
    trigger offences, the extent of the  Appellant's  criminality  and  the
    contents of the OASys Report.   These  factors  led  to  the  Appellant
    presenting a high risk of the commission of  further  offences  of  the
    same order as the trigger offence.  Whilst the judge did not explicitly
    refer to the MAPPA level 3 assessment, we do not consider that  it  was
    necessary for her to do so because she accepted the  Respondent's  case
    that there was a high  risk  of  reoffending  and  she  understood  the
    seriousness of the Appellant's offences and the risk that he presented.
     The judge's finding, at [19], that the Appellant is not part of a gang
    or involved in serious organised crime was one that was  open  her.  In
    addition, it was a factor she was entitled to  attach  weight  to  when
    deciding the  extent  and  nature  of  the  threat.   Whilst  there  is
    reference within the OASys Report to the Appellant being in a  gang  or
    involved  in  serious  organised  crime,  the  evidence   amounted   to
    unsupported assertions.  There is  no  substance  in  the  Respondent's
    ground that the judge did not consider material evidence.

19.  The judge set out  relevant  case  law.  We  do  not  accept  that  she
    artificially and erroneously limited the scope  of  her  assessment  of
    what is capable of establishing imperative grounds which would  justify
    deportation for the purposes of the 2016 Regulations.  Her  conclusions
    at [32] do not establish that she wrongly limited the scope of what can
    constitute imperative grounds. She understood that whilst  it  includes
    terrorism  it  also  includes  serious  criminality  falling  short  of
    terrorism. What the judge did was to take what limited  guidance  there
    is from the case law available. She recognised at [23] that  there  was
    no guidance in the Regulations  about  what  is  meant  by  "imperative
    grounds". Ultimately, in our view she made an assessment based  on  the
    circumstances of the Appellant which is what is required  in  cases  of
    this nature.

20.      The Respondent's position is that the judge did not  properly  take
    into account SSHD v Staszewski. Whilst it  is  not  apparent  that  her
    attention was drawn to it, there is nothing in the judgement that would
    establish that the judge erred in her approach. The observation made by
    the Court of Appeal at [24] was that it will be unwise  to  attempt  to
    lay down guidelines and  that  the  relevant  question  (in  this  case
    whether there are imperative grounds of public security to justify  the
    Appellant's deportation, whilst in the case of  Straszewski  the  issue
    was whether there were serious grounds) is likely to turn  to  a  large
    extent on the particular facts of the case.  In the absence of specific
    guidelines and/ or a definition of what constitutes imperative grounds,
    the judge's approach to the assessment was  correct  and  her  ultimate
    decision was open to her.

21.  Insofar as the grounds rely on the case of Bulale v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 806 they conflate the  test  of
    imperative grounds with the test  under  27(5)(c)  of  the  Regulations
    which the judge found had been satisfied in this case,  in  any  event.
    The judge was satisfied that  the  Appellant's  conduct  represented  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society. Indeed,  it  would  be  difficult  to
    reach a different conclusion  on  the  evidence  before  her;  however,
    unless the deportation can be justified on imperative  grounds,  it  is
    not lawful.

22.  The challenge to the decision regarding  imperative  grounds  does  not
    properly identify an error of law.  The judge was entitled to  conclude
    that the  Appellant's  conduct  did  not  reach  the  very,  very  high
    threshold. In the absence of  irrationality  (which  was  not,  in  any
    event, pleaded in the grounds of appeal), the decision was open to  the
    judge on the evidence before her.

Notice of Decision

23.  The decision of the FTT to allow the Appellant's appeal under the  2016
    Regulations is  lawful  and  sustainable.   The  Secretary  of  State's
    application is dismissed.

24.  No anonymity direction is made.

-----------------------

[1] 27.- (1)  In  this  regulation,  a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
        decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security  or
        public health.

    (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

    (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a person with a
        right of permanent residence under regulation 15 except  on  serious
        grounds of public policy and public security.

    (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative  grounds
        of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

        (a)   has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period  of
           at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or

        (b)   is under the age of 18, unless the relevant decision is in the
           best interests of the person concerned, as provided for  in  the
           Convention on the Rights of the Child  adopted  by  the  General
           Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989(17).

    (5)  The public policy and public security requirements of  the  United
        Kingdom include restricting  rights  otherwise  conferred  by  these
        Regulations  in  order  to  protect  the  fundamental  interests  of
        society, and where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public
        policy or public security it must also be taken in  accordance  with
        the following principles-

        (a)     the   decision   must   comply   with   the   principle   of
           proportionality;

        (b)   the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct
           of the person concerned;

        (c)   the personal conduct of the person must represent  a  genuine,
           present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one  of  the
           fundamental interests  of  society,  taking  into  account  past
           conduct of the person and that the threat does not  need  to  be
           imminent;

        (d)   matters isolated from the particulars of  the  case  or  which
           relate to considerations of general prevention  do  not  justify
           the decision;

        (e)   a person's previous criminal convictions do not in  themselves
           justify the decision;

        (f)   the decision may be taken on preventative grounds, even in the
           absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the  grounds
           are specific to the person.

    (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public  policy
        and public security in relation to a person ("P") who is resident in
        the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
        considerations such as the age, state of health, family and economic
        situation of P, P's length of residence in the United  Kingdom,  P's
        social and cultural integration into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
        extent of P's links with P's country of origin.

    (7)  In the case of a relevant decision  taken  on  grounds  of  public
        health-

        (a)   a disease that does not have epidemic potential as defined  by
           the relevant instruments of the World Health Organisation or  is
           not a disease listed in Schedule  1  to  the  Health  Protection
           (Notification) Regulations 2010(18); or

        (b)   if the person concerned is in the United Kingdom, any  disease
           occurring after the three month period beginning on the date  on
           which the person arrived in the United Kingdom,

        does not constitute grounds for the decision.

    (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether the requirements  of  this
        regulation  are  met  must  (in  particular)  have  regard  to   the
        considerations contained in Schedule  1  (considerations  of  public
        policy, public security and the  fundamental  interests  of  society
        etc.).




[2] (24) Accordingly,  the  greater  the  degree  of  integration  of  Union
    citizens and their family members in the host Member State, the greater
    the  degree  of  protection  against  expulsion  should  be.  Only   in
    exceptional circumstances, where there are imperative grounds of public
    security, should an expulsion measure be taken against  Union  citizens
    who have resided for many years in the territory  of  the  host  Member
    State, in particular  when  they  were  born  and  have  resided  there
    throughout their life.  In  addition,  such  exceptional  circumstances
    should also apply to an expulsion  measure  taken  against  minors,  in
    order to protect their links with their family, in accordance with  the
    United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child,  of  20  November
    1989.



[3] Article 28

Protection against expulsion

1.   Before taking an expulsion decision on  grounds  of  public  policy  or
    public  security,  the  host  Member  State  shall  take   account   of
    considerations such as how long the individual concerned has resided on
    its territory, his/her  age,  state  of  health,  family  and  economic
    situation, social and cultural integration into the host  Member  State
    and the extent of his/her links with the country of origin.

2.   The host Member State may not take an expulsion decision against  Union
    citizens or their family members, irrespective of nationality, who have
    the right of permanent residence on its territory,  except  on  serious
    grounds of public policy or public security.

3.   An expulsion decision may not be taken against Union  citizens,  except
    if the decision is based on imperative grounds of public  security,  as
    defined by Member States, if they:

    (a)  have resided in the host Member State for the previous ten  years;
        or

    (b)  are a minor, except if the expulsion is  necessary  for  the  best
        interests of the child,  as  provided  for  in  the  United  Nations
        Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989.
