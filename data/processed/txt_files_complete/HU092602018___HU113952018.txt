                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Beach, promulgated on 28th November 2018, following a hearing at Taylor
    House on 7th November 2018.  In the decision,  the  judge  allowed  the
    appeal of the Appellants, whereupon the Respondent Secretary of  State,
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

 2. For convenience I will refer to the parties as they were referred to in
    the First-tier Tribunal.



The Appellants

 3. The Appellants are husband and wife.  Both are  citizens  of  Pakistan.
    The First Appellant, who is the principal Appellant, was  born  on  1st
    March 1980.  The Second Appellant, his dependent wife, was born on 27th
    January 1985.  On 11th August 2016, the  First  Appellant  applied  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant,  and  on  23rd  February
    2017 he applied to various applications for indefinite leave to remain,
    on a long residence basis, given that he had  entered  the  UK  on  4th
    January 2007, as a student, and remained here since then.  The decision
    appealed against is  dated  5th  April  2018,  and  it  is  a  decision
    whereupon the Respondent refused the First Appellant's application  for
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK with his dependent wife.

The Judge's Decision

 4. In what is a detailed and well-compiled decision,  the  judge  observed
    how the First Appellant had in 2008 applied to remain in the  UK  as  a
    Tier 1 (Highly Skilled Post-Study)  Migrant,  for  which  he  had  been
    granted leave to remain in that capacity until 20th October  2010.   He
    had gone on to establish a business in this country,  where  he  was  a
    sole trader, and the business was called ZMS Associates.  He was  self-
    employed from 1st February 2010 until 1st February 2011, however,  when
    he worked as an IT consultant.  During that time, the First  Appellant,
    who claimed to be earning �40,430.65, the First Appellant had  declared
    zero tax liability.

 5. For the other years, there had been an amended tax return filed for the
    years 2009 to 2010, for 2010 to 2011, and for 2012 to 2013.   In  2016,
    when it came for  the  First  Appellant  to  make  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain, on the basis of ten years' residence in the
    UK, the First Appellant checked his tax matters.  He claims he went  to
    a friend to discuss the tax matters.  His friend checked  his  affairs.
    His friend told him that he would need an SA302  form  (paragraph  11).
    His accountant, Sarmand & Co, completed his tax returns  for  the  year
    ending 2010 and the year ending 2011.  He received a  letter  from  his
    accountant asking him to check the tax return,  sign  and  approve  it.
    The principal Appellant said that "the email had  since  been  deleted"
    (paragraph 13).

 6. When asked at the hearing why he did not realise  that  he  received  a
    zero tax liability for the year 2010 to 2011, the  principal  Appellant
    said he was "not a specialist in accountancy".  He said that in 2016 he
    was discussing matters with his friend and his friend suggested that he
    could check his account.  He said that his friend  looked  through  and
    told him that there were anomalies.  The First Appellant's account then
    goes on to show that:-

         "he had checked because he was due to make an application  for  ILR
         and agreed that this was the case.  He denied checking  because  he
         thought that he would be discovered and said that he  just  thought
         that he should check as he was making his  application"  (paragraph
         14).

 7. The judge went on to identify with clarity  the  issue  that  fell  for
    determination.  Under paragraph 322(5), the question  was  whether  the
    Appellant's character, conduct and associations were such that  it  was
    undesirable for him to be granted indefinite leave to remain.  This was
    on account of his failure to disclose his  income  to  the  HMRC,  "(it
    having been accepted in a previous appeal decision that he did  earn  a
    self-employed  profit  of  �40,430.65)"  (see  paragraph  31   of   the
    decision).  The judge raised the possibility as to whether this "was an
    innocent mistake and, if it were an innocent mistake, what  impact,  if
    any, the Appellant's failure to properly check his tax  return  has  on
    his application for indefinite leave to remain in  the  UK"  (paragraph
    31).

 8. The judge observed that the First Appellant was sent his tax return  by
    his accountants and asked to sign it  off,  and  he  did  this  without
    properly noticing the self-employed income had not been  declared.   It
    was only in 2016 that he thought it would be sensible to check his  tax
    affairs "before he made an application for indefinite leave  to  remain
    in the UK" (paragraph 32).  The judge did not find the Appellant to  be
    a "particularly impressive witness" (paragraph 33).

 9. There was an  accountant's  letter,  which  was  equally  cryptic.   It
    appeared to suggest that "We were not his accountants and  advised  him
    to contact specialist tax accountants to do a full due diligence on his
    tax return matters" (paragraph  33).   It  was  unclear  to  the  judge
    whether this suggested that somebody  else  was  acting  as  the  First
    Appellant's accountants, or whether it implied that these were not  his
    accountants for the purposes of his tax returns in question  (paragraph
    34).

10. The judge's decision was that the First Appellant was guilty simply  of
    an innocent mistake.  This is because the First Appellant had "declared
    his company dividends in his tax returns suggesting an Appellant who is
    not seeking to deliberately fail to disclose income".

11. Secondly, if the  First  Appellant  was  deliberately  setting  out  to
    defraud the authorities then one  would  have  expected  him  "to  have
    continued to mis-declare such income".  Third, this was not a  case  of
    "an appellant who has disclosed a  lower  amount  from  self-employment
    than that earned by him but a case where  all  the  income  from  self-
    employment has been missed off the tax return" (paragraph 36).

12. Finally, this was consistent with the First Appellant's own explanation
    given at the hearing  before  Judge  Beach  that  "he  simply  did  not
    properly check the tax return, rather that he  deliberately  sought  to
    reduce his tax liability " (paragraph 36).

13. Against this background, the judge was firmly of the view that this was
    an Appellant who "has voluntarily taken steps to amend his tax  returns
    and that he has provided a plausible explanation for his incorrect  tax
    return  which  is  not  inconsistent  with  the  evidence  before   me"
    (paragraph 37).  On one view, it is clear that these  conclusions  were
    ones to which the judge was perfectly entitled to come to, as  a  fact-
    finding Tribunal, who had heard the evidence, and  had  looked  at  the
    documentation before the Tribunal, to ensure the level  of  consistency
    between the two.

Grounds of Application

14. However, the Secretary of State then  appealed  the  decision.   In  so
    doing, the Secretary of State stated that the decision of  Judge  Beach
    was unsustainable for a number of reasons.

15. First, the First Appellant had simply left off a sum of �40,430.65 from
    his tax liability for the tax year 2010 to 2011, and this could not  be
    simply designated as an oversight.

16. Second, the case law is clear that the First  Appellant  is  personally
    responsible for his own tax affairs and should be fully  aware  of  the
    amounts declared to the HMRC.  In Abbasi (JR/13807/2016), the  Tribunal
    stated that, "the explanation in such 'self-employed income' cases such
    that the accountant can be blamed has  been  given  short  shrift",  as
    demonstrated  in  Samant  [2017]  UKAIT  UR  (JR/6546/2016).   This  is
    because:-

         "essentially the applicant must take responsibility for his own tax
         affairs.  Not only would the applicant have supplied the figures to
         his accountant, he will have checked them  and  would  individually
         have received a tax bill" (paragraph 73).

17. Third, the Upper Tribunal decision in Khan [2018] UKUT 00384, makes  it
    clear in head note (iv) that:-

         "For an Applicant simply to blame his  or  her  accountant  for  an
         'error' in relation to the historical tax return will  not  be  the
         end of the matter, given that the accountant will  or  should  have
         asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was accurate and  to
         have signed the tax return. Furthermore  the  Applicant  will  have
         known of his or her earnings and will  have  expected  to  pay  tax
         thereon.  If the Applicant does not take steps within a  reasonable
         time to remedy  the  situation,  the  Secretary  of  State  may  be
         entitled to conclude that this failure justifies a conclusion  that
         there has been deceit or dishonesty".

18. Moreover, head note  (v)  of  Khan,  also  makes  it  clear  that  when
    considering whether an applicant is dishonest or merely  careless,  the
    Secretary of State should consider:-

         "i.  Whether the explanation for the error  by  the  accountant  is
             plausible;

         ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist  ...
             has been disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for why
             it is missing;

         iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had been  made
             because his liability to pay tax was less than he should  have
             expected;

         iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken steps to remedy
             the situation ...".

19. In this case, of course, lest it be forgotten, the First Appellant  did
    himself, voluntarily before making his application, "take steps  within
    a reasonable time to remedy the situation".  Moreover, this is  also  a
    case where the First Appellant is not actually blaming  his  accountant
    directly.  As the  decision  of  Judge  Beach  made  clear,  the  First
    Appellant throughout accepted that he was responsible for his  own  tax
    affairs.  In fact, he had even said that he had received an e-mail from
    his accountants (which he claims to have deleted by  the  time  of  the
    hearing) which had asked  him  to  check  his  tax  affairs  before  he
    proceeded any further.

20. However, permission to appeal was nevertheless granted in this case  by
    the Tribunal on 27th December  2018,  with  it  being  noted  that  the
    responsibility  of  the  First  Appellant  for  tax  on   earnings   of
    �40,430.65, where he was self-employed between  2010  and  2011,  could
    simply not have been arguably explained in this way.

Submissions

21. At the hearing before me, on 12th April 2019, Mr Whitwell, appearing as
    Senior Home Office Presenting Officer,  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State, handed up a "Respondent Skeleton  Argument",  which
    contained a section on "Introduction" and a section  on  "Submissions".
    In the latter section, there was a paragraph  2  which  dealt  with  an
    aspect which had not been raised either before the Tribunal below or in
    the Grounds of Application to this Tribunal now.  This stated that  the
    judge below records (at  paragraph  31)  that  it  was  accepted  in  a
    previous decision that there had been an earned  self-appointed  profit
    of �40,430.65.  However, in the light of the additional  evidence  from
    the HMRC and the thrust of the Respondent's case, the judge appears  to
    have treated the earnings as  determinative,  rather  than  a  starting
    point.

22. The refusal letter, however, was clear that the case was  being  argued
    both ways.  It was made clear (at page 4 of 9) that the First Appellant
    was  either  misleading  the  UKVI  for  the  purposes  of  an  earlier
    application dated  18th  October  2010,  or  the  First  Appellant  was
    misleading the HMRC about his tax liability.  To that extent, the judge
    had considered the appeal only so  far  as  it  related  to  the  First
    Appellant's conduct with respect to his dealings  with  the  HMRC.   Mr
    Youssefian immediately objected to the inclusion of this submission, on
    the basis that it formed no part of the earlier case on behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State before Judge  Beach,  and  formed  no  part  of  the
    application in the Grounds of Appeal.

23. When I asked Mr  Whitwell  whether  he  had  actually  made  a  written
    application to amend his Grounds of Application, he submitted  that  he
    had not.  However, he suggested that the additional ground formed  part
    of the "Respondent's  Skeleton  Argument",  and  would  amount  to  "an
    application for an amendment".  I cannot agree with this.   I  conclude
    that Mr Youssefian is justified in his objections to the  inclusion  of
    this ground.  Not only has there been no  written  application  for  an
    amendment of the Grounds of Application, but the Respondent's  skeleton
    argument does not even contain a reference to this new  ground  in  the
    "Introduction" but consigns it to  the  "Submissions"  section  of  the
    skeleton argument, and even then does not include a prefatory remark of
    an application to amend grounds.

24.  Mr  Whitwell  proceeded  with  his  other  submissions,  to  which  Mr
    Youssefian did not properly take any exception, and  these  submissions
    amount to four distinct points.  First, the  judge  did  not  find  the
    explanation for the error by the accountant  to  be  plausible,  making
    clear that "the accountant's letter does not state the reasons for  all
    the errors", and "... it is unclear whether they are stating that  they
    were not his accountants for the purpose of his tax returns or  whether
    they mean that they were not his accountants when he returned to  query
    those returns".  This was contrary to Khan [2018] UKUT 00384, where  it
    was stated that it is a legitimate question for the Secretary of State,
    to consider "whether the explanation for the error by the accountant is
    plausible" (paragraph 37(vi)(i)).

25. Second, Mr Whitwell submitted that there was no  plausible  reason  why
    the  documentation,  such  as  the  correspondence  between  the  First
    Appellant and his accountant, where he claims to have been  alerted  by
    the accountant to check his tax affairs had gone  missing.   The  First
    Appellant had stated that "the email had since been deleted" (paragraph
    13).  The judge should have considered whether  this  was  a  plausible
    explanation.  Indeed, the First Appellant did not have  the  bundle  of
    documents sent to his accountants (see paragraph 27 of  the  decision),
    even though this was available recently to him.  This too was  contrary
    to Khan (supra) at paragraph 37(vi)(ii), where it was stated that it is
    a legitimate question for the Secretary of  State  as  to  whether  the
    documentation which can be assumed to exist has been disclosed or there
    is a plausible explanation for why it is missing.

26. Third, the judge did not grapple with the First Appellant not realising
    that an error had been made on  his  declared  return,  given  his  tax
    liability for the tax year of 2010 to 2011,  was  not  just  less  than
    expected, but  was  zero.   This  is  despite  him  earning  a  sum  of
    �40,430.65.  The judge had simply recorded this in oral  evidence.   It
    was not enough to accept the Appellant's answer  that  he  was  "not  a
    specialist in accountancy" (paragraph 14).  This was contrary  to  Khan
    (supra) at paragraph 37(vi)(iii), where it was  stated  that  it  is  a
    legitimate question for the Secretary of State as to why the  applicant
    did not realise that an error had been made because  his  liability  to
    pay tax was less than he should have expected.

27. Finally, the judge did not appear to take into account  the  fact  that
    the First Appellant, at the date of the hearing, still  owed  the  HMRC
    the sum of approximately �9,000 (see paragraph  11  of  the  decision),
    given that  the  tax  return  was  amended  in  June  2016,  which  was
    approximately five years after the end of the  tax  year  in  question.
    There had been a significant delay and the return was only  checked  in
    contemplation  of  his  application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain
    (paragraph 14).

28. For his part, Mr Youssefian, made the  following  submissions.   First,
    that taken cumulatively, the appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    simply a disagreement with the decision of the judge below,  which  was
    in  many  respects  favourably  disposed  towards  the  Respondent,  in
    observing that the First Appellant was not in  an  impressive  witness,
    and that he had been personally responsible for his tax  affairs.   The
    judge was clear that "the accountant's letter does not state the reason
    for the errors" (paragraph 34).  The judge had followed  the  reasoning
    to  be  applied  in  a  structured  and  step-by-step  fashion,  before
    concluding with the question as to  whether  the  First  Appellant  was
    simply negligent to the extent that he failed to properly check his tax
    return, or whether he was actually dishonest or deceitful.  It was only
    then that the judge concluded that the First  Appellant  had  not  been
    deliberately dishonest (paragraph 38).

29. The reason for all of this, submitted Mr Youssefian, was that there was
    in this case no pattern of dishonesty.   There  was  simply  one  case,
    between 2010 and 2011, where the tax liability had been left off.  This
    in itself was directly addressed by the judge when the  judge  observed
    that,  had  the  First  Appellant  wished  to  dishonestly  avoid   tax
    altogether,  he  would  have  "disclosed  a  lower  amount  from  self-
    employment than that earned by him" (paragraph 36).

30. Second, the judge was  clear  that  this  was  an  Appellant  who  "has
    voluntarily taken steps to amend  his  tax  returns  and  that  he  has
    provided a plausible explanation for his incorrect tax return which  is
    not  inconsistent  with  the  evidence  before  me"   (paragraph   37).
    Accordingly, the judge had approached the matter entirely as it  should
    have been done and the attack on the decision was simply a disagreement
    with the conclusions drawn.  Indeed, there was no  allegation  for  the
    tax years 2012 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2014.  Insofar as  Mr  Whitwell
    had referred to the case of Khan  [2018]  UKUT  00384,  it  had  to  be
    remembered that this was a judicial review case, where the task for the
    Tribunal was one of ascertaining "irrationality",  which  was  not  the
    issue before this Tribunal.

31. Finally, it cannot be emphasised strongly enough that  because  of  the
    seriousness of the  allegation,  namely  that  an  applicant  has  been
    "dishonest"  to  such  an  extent  that  "his  character,  conduct   or
    associations mean  that  it  is  undesirable  for  him  to  be  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK", the burden upon the Secretary of
    State is all too often not easy to discharge, on well-known principles,
    namely, that the more serious the consequence  for  an  applicant,  the
    greater the burden upon he who alleges dishonesty.  This was  one  such
    case, submitted Mr Youssefian, and the  First  Appellant,  on  properly
    found facts by the Tribunal, had only been guilty  of  negligence,  and
    not outright dishonesty.

Error of Law

32. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007), such that I should set aside  the  decision.   I  come  to  this
    conclusion,  notwithstanding  Mr  Youssefian's  able  and   commendable
    efforts to persuade me otherwise.  My reasons are as follows.

33. First, the judge alluded to the possibility (at paragraph 36) that  the
    Appellant had to furnish amended tax returns  for  the  years  2009  to
    2010, for 2010 to 2011, and for 2012 to 2013, and that this  "could  be
    indicative of an Appellant who does not take sufficient care  over  his
    tax affairs".  It is, of course, true, as the judge also points out  in
    the same  paragraph,  that  the  fact  that  the  First  Appellant  had
    "declared his company  dividends  in  his  tax  returns"  suggested  an
    applicant "who is not seeking to deliberately fail to disclose income".
     Nevertheless, it does not follow that  for  him  not  to  declare  any
    income at all for the years 2010 to 2011,  is  actually  any  different
    from a person who discloses a "lower amount from  self-employment  than
    that earned by him" (paragraph 36).  In order to properly  decide  this
    question, it is important to apply the strictures, that Mr Whitwell has
    pointed out to me, in the recent decision in Khan [2018] UKUT 00384.

34. Second, in the same way, the First Appellant claimed to  have  received
    an e-mail from his accountant "asking him to check the tax return, sign
    and approve it" (paragraph 13), but this was an e-mail which he  failed
    to then produce before the Tribunal, alleging that he  had  deleted  it
    (paragraph 14).  It was incumbent upon the judge to decide whether this
    was a plausible explanation.  Again, the decision in Khan  [2018]  UKUT
    00384 requires that such consideration be given.

35. Third, the First Appellant amended his  tax  documents  in  June  2016,
    prior to making his application for indefinite leave, but it had  still
    taken him some six years to  amend  his  tax  returns,  and  there  are
    amounts that are still unpaid on these returns.

36. Finally, the fact that the First Appellant is a  businessman  raises  a
    question as to whether he could  really  so  easily  explain  away  his
    failings with respect to his tax affairs.  These are all matters  which
    will need to be reconsidered  again  by  the  Tribunal  below,  and  in
    particular the application of the decision in Khan [2018]  UKUT  00384,
    and this being so, the appropriate course of action for  this  Tribunal
    is to remit the matter below to be decided by a judge other than  Judge
    Beach.  Accordingly, in remaking  my  decision,  I  conclude  that  the
    matter properly falls to be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal.
