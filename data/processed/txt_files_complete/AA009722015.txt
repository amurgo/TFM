Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Burrett, Counsel, instructed by Nandy & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This appeal falls to be remade following my identification of a
         material error of law in the decision of Judge of the First-tier
         Tribunal Afako who, in a decision promulgated on 09 May 2016,
         dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision
         of 09 January 2015 to refuse him leave to remain the UK and to
         remove him to Jamaica.

      2. In my 'error of law' decision promulgated on 20 July 2016 I found
         that the First-tier Tribunal judge misdirected himself in his
         application of s.117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
         Act 2002 in light of the Court of Appeal decision in MA (Pakistan)
         & Ors, R (on the application of) v Upper Tribunal (Immigration and
         Asylum Chamber) & Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 705. The judge considered
         the reasonableness of the Appellant's children being expected to
         leave the United Kingdom separately from countervailing public
         interest factors. S.117B(6) was not read as a self-contained
         provision and the judge's reasonableness assessment under s.117B(6)
         accordingly failed to take into account the public interest factors
         otherwise identified by him.

      3. As there was a relative dearth of evidence going to the issue of
         reasonableness under s.117B(6) I acceded to an application by Mr
         Burrett to adjourn the hearing to enable further evidence to be
         adduced, by either side, going to this issue. No issue had been
         raised in respect of the First-tier Tribunal judge's core factual
         findings and these were consequently retained.

      4. The Appellant produced a further short bundle of documents
         consisting of a letter from BunnyHop Day Nursery dated 6 October
         2016, a letter from Deptford Park Primary School dated 7 October
         2016, a further letter from the Appellant's partner dated 25
         September 2016, and a letter from a family friend, SD, dated 5
         October 2016. At the appeal hearing the Appellant produced two
         further documents: a letter from the VG, his former spouse, and a
         letter from TM, the daughter of VG and the Appellant. There was no
         objection to the late service of these documents.

   Background

      5. The Appellant is a national of Jamaica, date of birth 04 November
         1980. He arrived in the United Kingdom on 9 October 2001 and,
         although refused entry, was granted temporary admission. He
         subsequently absconded and was arrested by the police in May 2002
         at which time he claimed asylum. A decision made to refuse his
         asylum claim was not effectively served and was subsequently
         withdrawn on 8 August 2006.

      6. The Appellant applied for leave to remain on several occasions
         including 2004 (on the basis of his spousal relationship with VG),
         and on 19 December 2005 (on the basis of the 2003 Family Exercise).
         These applications were refused. The Appellant applied for further
         leave to remain on 19 September 2012 and 30 October 2012, but these
         applications were refused in November 2012. The Appellant was able
         to appeal this decision and, on 6 February 2013, his appeal was
         allowed to a limited extent and remitted back to the Respondent to
         await a lawful decision.

      7. On 9 September 2014 the Appellant's representatives informed the
         Respondent that he wished to pursue his claim for asylum. The
         Respondent considered and rejected his asylum claim in a reasons
         for refusal letter dated 9 January 2015. Although his appeal to the
         first-tier Tribunal was initially predicated on his fear of
         persecution in Jamaica the Appellant did not pursue his asylum
         claim before the First-tier Tribunal. The Respondent also refused
         the Appellant's human rights application which was based on Article
         8 and revolved around his private life and his family life
         relationships with his partner (AMC), their two children, and TM,
         the Appellant's child from his former spousal relationship.

      8. The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for leave to
         remain on the basis of his private and family life as the Appellant
         did not meet the requirements of S-LTR 1.5 and S-LTR 1.6. of
         Appendix FM. This was because the Appellant had accumulated a large
         number of criminal convictions.

The Appellant's criminality

      9. The Appellant has 14 convictions for 16 offences committed between
         November 2006 and 29 February 2016. In addition to his offences the
         Respondent sought to rely upon evidence in the possession of the
         police relating to the Appellant's other encounters with the
         criminal justice system that did not lead to formal charges being
         brought against him. This information was provided in the context
         of a "Nexus Appeal" before the First-tier Tribunal.

     10. The Appellant has a long and troubling history of low-level
         criminality. On 20 November 2006 he was cautioned for common
         assault and sentenced to a 12 month supervision requirement. This
         involved an assault on his wife in the presence of a child. On 17
         November 2006 he was convicted of displaying racially
         threatening/abusive/insulting writing or signs causing distress and
         fined �100 and ordered to pay �30 costs. On 20 November 2006 he was
         found guilty of common assault and sentenced to 80 hours community
         service. On 6 August 2007 the Appellant was convicted of using
         threatening/abusive or insulting words or behaviour likely to cause
         distress and received a 12 month conditional discharge. On 02 March
         2009 the Appellant was convicted of battery and sentenced to 60
         days imprisonment. This conviction related to an offence on 21
         August 2008 when the Appellant attacked a former partner with whom
         he has a child, kicking her to the ground. She suffered a cut lip
         and one of her nails was torn from her finger. The incident was
         witnessed by the child. A previous incident involving another
         assault on the same partner on 14 May 2006 did not lead to court
         proceedings and ended in a caution. On 04 August 2009 the Appellant
         was convicted of one count of using a vehicle while uninsured and
         one count of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence.
         He was disqualified for driving for six months and had to pay �100
         costs. On 11 October 2010 the Appellant was convicted of
         harassment. He was sentenced to 4 months imprisonment, and had a
         restraining order imposed on him. This related to an incident on 17
         October 2009 when the Appellant threatened and harassed his cousin,
         threw a large stone through the cousin's window and then made
         threatening phone calls.

     11. On 13 September 2012 the Appellant was cautioned for possession of
         cannabis. On 24 May 2013 the Appellant was convicted of possession
         of a controlled class B drug and fined �250. On 27 August 2013 he
         was convicted of possession of a controlled class B drug and
         received a community order. On 21 October 2013 the Appellant was
         convicted of cultivating cannabis and received a community order.
         On 12 May 2014 he was convicted of failing to comply with the
         requirements of a community order and sentenced to a further 50
         hours unpaid work requirement. On 8 August 2014 the Appellant
         committed a battery and received a police caution. This involved an
         assault against his present partner, but she would not confirm the
         claim.

     12. On 30 January 2015 the Appellant was found in possession of
         cannabis but the incident that led to the arrest arose from the
         concerns of members of the public who witnessed him arguing with
         and assaulting a woman in Bromley. The woman was not found so no
         complaint was raised. The Appellant however accepted that he was
         arrested in those circumstances. On 13 February 2016 the Appellant
         smashed two gaming machines and then demanded his money back
         alleging that he made a wrong bet. He was found guilty of criminal
         damage and ordered to pay �250 compensation. On this occasion he
         was also questioned in relation to being in possession of a bladed
         Article.

     13. Having found that the Appellant did not meet the Suitability
         requirements of the immigration rules the Respondent considered
         that the best interests of the Appellant's children, who were all
         British citizens, would be served by them remaining in the United
         Kingdom with their mothers. At no point in her decision did the
         Respondent suggest that the Appellant was not in a genuine and
         subsisting relationship with his children. The Respondent
         considered that the Appellant posed a serious risk to the community
         and that the refusal of his claim was a proportionate measure.

Retained findings of fact made by the First-tier Tribunal

     14. The First-tier Tribunal judge heard evidence from the Appellant and
         his partner, AMC. A police constable adopted his three witness
         statements but was asked no questions by either party.

     15. Being satisfied that the Appellant had lived in the United Kingdom
         for 14 years, albeit unlawfully, the judge found that the Appellant
         had developed sufficient ties to have established a private life
         here. The judge accepted that the Appellant married in 2003 and had
         a daughter with his wife, born in September 2003. The Appellant
         separated from his wife in 2009 and then met his current partner
         with whom he has two children, born in January 2012 and June 2014.
         Although the judge found that AMC had painted too rosy a picture of
         life with the Appellant he was nevertheless satisfied that the
         Appellant enjoyed family life with his partner and all his
         children, all of whom were British. In so concluding the judge was
         satisfied that the Appellant continued to have contact with all
         three of his children. This reflects the oral evidence before the
         First-tier Tribunal to the effect that the Appellant saw TM every
         two weeks, an arrangement reached informally. TM would stay every
         other weekend, arriving at his house on Friday and returning on
         Sunday evening to her mother. TM attended birthday celebrations and
         had a good relationship with her half siblings. The Appellant
         stated that he did not support TM financially but would sometimes
         help out if her mother needed assistance with childcare during the
         week. In relation to his other two children the Appellant said that
         he took them to school and fed them when AMC was busy. In her
         evidence AMC stated that the Appellant looked after the two
         children as they attended nursery and he was the main carer
         whenever she was working, and was responsible for the bedtime
         routine. AMC also confirmed that TM came to stay with them. AMC
         asserted that she and her children would not relocate to Jamaica.

     16. The judge found that the Suitability grounds contained in Appendix
         FM were correctly engaged and made out. As such, the Appellant
         could not succeed under the immigration rules giving expression to
         Article 8 principles (paragraph 276ADE and Appendix-FM). The judge
         concluded that the Appellant was a persistent offender who had
         demonstrated a particular disregard for the law. The judge found
         that the Appellant met the definition of foreign criminal in s.117D
         (2)(c)(iii) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
         (the definition includes "a person who is not a British citizen and
         who has been convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and who
         is a persistent offender"). The judge concluded that the Appellant
         was a violent man who had been willing to use violence against
         women with whom he was in a relationship, and to damage the
         property of others. The judge found that the fact that children had
         been present had not stopped him from being violent to their
         mothers. The judge was satisfied that the Appellant was likely to
         continue to reoffend and posed a threat to the community. He found
         that the Appellant was not a positive role model for his family.

The Upper Tribunal hearing

     17. The new documentary evidence from the nursery indicated that AMC's
         eldest daughter often spoke about the Appellant and that he helped
         her with her "homework" or to learn new things. The nursery letter
         confirmed that the Appellant had dropped off his two youngest
         children at the nursery and collected them. It was claimed that he
         had a very strong bond with his two youngest daughters and that he
         often spent time with the staff discussing what he could do at home
         to further their learning. In her letter dated 25 September 2016
         AMC stated that the Appellant was a very important figure in their
         children's lives, and that the children depended on him for support
         in every aspect of their lives. She confirmed that the Appellant
         had a good relationship with the children's teachers. VG confirmed
         in her letter that she and the Appellant co-parent in looking after
         TM. VG confirmed that the Appellant has TM every other weekend and
         also collected her from school on days when she had meetings or
         worked late. VG confirmed that TM loves spending time with the
         Appellant, and that he has always remained in her life. VG claimed
         that without the Appellant's support she would struggle as she
         would be unable to work at weekends or in evenings. In her
         handwritten letter TM stated that the Appellant was "a great dad,"
         that she loved spending time with him, and that he and her mother
         were her best friends. TM stated that she could talk to the
         Appellant about anything as he was less disciplined then her
         mother.

     18. The Appellant was not asked any questions in examination in chief.
         In cross-examination he provided detailed answers when asked about
         TM's school and her school year. He had been to TM's parents
         evening two months previously. He knew where her local dentist was
         located. He had recently bought her a coat and supported her desire
         to become a police officer. In response to questions from me the
         Appellant stated that TM would have no life in Jamaica as all her
         family members and friends were in the UK including her maternal
         grandparents and her paternal grandmother. AMC was asked no
         questions in examination in chief. In cross-examination she
         confirmed that she was always aware of the Appellant's immigration
         status. She gave details of her self-employment and said that she
         had last been to Jamaica on holiday in 2008. Although born in
         Jamaica she had lived in the UK since the age of five, although she
         still had some relatives in Jamaica. Her mother lived in the
         Jamaica but AMC did not have any relationship with her. AMC stated
         that it was not in her family's best interest to relocate to
         Jamaica citing her oldest child's commencement of primary school
         and social inclusion issues. She confirmed that she did not have
         any criminal convictions.

The relevant statutory framework, principles and authorities in assessing
Article 8 claims

     19. The burden of proving that his removal would constitute a breach of
         Article 8 rests on the Appellant and the standard is that of the
         balance of probabilities.

     20. Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
         requires a Tribunal, in considering the public interest question
         relating to whether a decision breaches a person's right to respect
         for private or family life under Article 8, to have regard to the
         considerations listed in section 117B.

     21. Section 117B of the 2002 Act provides:

         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public interest.

         (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

               (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

               (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-

               (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

               (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4) Little weight should be given to-

               (a) a private life, or

               (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that is
               established by a person at a time when the person is in the
               United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

               (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
               relationship with a qualifying child, and

               (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
               the United Kingdom.

     22. The decision of the House of Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27
         established that, on an appeal against a decision to remove by the
         Secretary of State on Article 8 grounds, the reviewing court must
         ask itself the following questions:

         (1) Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public
         authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to respect for
         his private or (as the case may be) family life?

         (2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity
         as potentially to e operation of Article 8?

         (3) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

         (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic society
         in the interests of national security, public safety or the
         economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder
         or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the
         protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

         (5) If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate
         public end sought to be achieved?"

     23. Following the amendment to the immigration rules that introduced
         Appendix FM the Court of Appeal concluded that compelling
         circumstances would need to be identified to support a claim for
         grant of LTR outside the new Rules in Appendix FM (SSHD v SS
         (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387).

     24. At [17] of MA (Pakistan) Elias LJ stated, with reference to
         s117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:

          Subsection (6) falls into a different category again. It does not
          simply identify factors which bear upon the public interest
          question. It resolves that question in the context of Article 8
          applications which satisfy the conditions in paragraphs (a) and
          (b). It does so by stipulating that once those conditions are
          satisfied, the public interest will not require the applicant's
          removal. Since the interference with the right to private or
          family life under Article 8(1) can only be justified where there
          is a sufficiently strong countervailing public interest falling
          within Article 8(2), if the public interest does not require
          removal, there is no other basis on which removal could be
          justified. It follows, in my judgment, that there can be no doubt
          that section 117B(6) must be read as a self-contained provision in
          the sense that Parliament has stipulated that where the conditions
          specified in the sub-section are satisfied, the public interest
          will not justify removal. It is not legitimate to have regard to
          public interest considerations unless that is permitted, either
          explicitly or implicitly, by the subsection itself.

     25. As the Court of Appeal clearly stated, s.117B(6) is a self-
         contained provision. Once its conditions are satisfied the public
         interest will not justify removal. The Court of Appeal did however
         find (albeit reluctantly) that public interest factors should be
         imported into consideration of the term 'reasonable' in s.117B(6).
         At [45] Elias LJ held,

          However, the approach I favour is inconsistent with the very
          recent decision of the Court of Appeal in MM (Uganda) where the
          court came down firmly in favour of the approach urged upon us by
          Ms Giovannetti, and I do not think that we ought to depart from
          it. In my judgment, if the court should have regard to the conduct
          of the applicant and any other matters relevant to the public
          interest when applying the "unduly harsh" concept under section
          117C(5), so should it when considering the question of
          reasonableness under section 117B(6). I recognise that the
          provisions in section 117C are directed towards the particular
          considerations which have to be borne in mind in the case of
          foreign criminals, and it is true that the court placed some
          weight on section 117C(2) which states that the more serious the
          offence, the greater is the interest in deportation of the
          prisoner. But the critical point is that section 117C(5) is in
          substance a free-standing provision in the same way as section
          117B(6), and even so the court in MM (Uganda) held that wider
          public interest considerations must be taken into account when
          applying the "unduly harsh" criterion. It seems to me that it must
          be equally so with respect to the reasonableness criterion in
          section 117B(6). It would not be appropriate to distinguish that
          decision simply because I have reservations whether it is correct.
          Accordingly, in line with the approach in that case, I will
          analyse the appeals on the basis that the Secretary of State's
          submission on this point is correct and that the only significance
          of section 117B(6) is that where the seven year rule is satisfied,
          it is a factor of some weight leaning in favour of leave to remain
          being granted.

Discussion

     26. I remind myself at the outset that the Appellant is not liable to a
         deportation. It was open to the Respondent to make a deportation
         order against the Appellant if she considered his presence was not
         conducive to the public good under s.3(5) of the Immigration Act
         1971. She did not take this course of action.

     27. It was not in dispute between the two representatives that the
         issue I have to decide is whether, pursuant to s.117B(6), it would
         be reasonable to expect the Appellant's British national children
         to leave the United Kingdom. In his submissions Mr Kotas accepted
         that, on balance, the Appellant had a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with TM.

     28. The Appellant undoubtedly has a genuine and subsisting relationship
         with his current partner and their children. AMC and her children
         are British nationals. AMC has lived in the UK since the age of
         five. Her oldest child has entered the reception year at primary
         school. AMC has her father in the UK and is self-employed. Having
         regard to the duty to take into account the best interests of the
         children, pursuant to s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship and
         Immigration Act 2009, and also taking into account their
         entitlements flowing from their status British citizens, I am
         satisfied that it is in the best interests of these two children to
         remain in the UK with both their parents. The children's best
         interests however, although a primary consideration, have to be
         weighed against the significant public interest factors in support
         of the Appellant's removal. The best interests of the children,
         although highly significant, is not a paramount factor in
         determining whether it would be reasonable, taking into account the
         public interest factors, to expect them to leave the UK.

     29. So far as I can tell the Appellant has never been granted leave to
         enter or remain in the UK. His relationship with AMC commenced when
         both of them where aware that he was in the country unlawfully.
         Although not liable to a deportation order the Appellant's
         criminality weighs heavily against him. I take into account the
         public interest in maintaining immigration control, the need to
         express society's revulsion at the offences committed by the
         Appellant and maintain social cohesion, the need to deter other
         would-be foreign criminals from committing offences in the UK, the
         need to protect members of the public, and the need to ensure
         public confidence in the removal of foreign national criminals. I
         take into account the fact that the Appellant was found by the
         First-tier Tribunal judge to be a persistent offender and someone
         who was likely to reoffend and to pose a danger to the community. I
         take into account the fact that AMC was born in Jamaica and,
         although she no longer has a relationship with her mother, she
         still has other, albeit more distant family relatives in Jamaica.
         The Appellant, being a national of Jamaica, would in any event be
         able to assist both AMC and their two children in adjusting to life
         in Jamaica. I additionally take into account the fact that both of
         the Appellant's and AMC's children are young and are likely to be
         much more adaptable to living in another country. They have not
         established strong relationships outside of their immediate family
         unit and there is nothing to suggest they suffer from any health
         issues.

     30. I am satisfied that it is open to AMC to travel with the Appellant
         or to join him in Jamaica. The choice is hers. There are no
         insurmountable obstacles preventing their relationship continuing
         in Jamaica. As such it is reasonable to expect the entire family to
         relocate as a single family unit. In the circumstances, and having
         regard to the significant public interest factors identified in
         paragraph 29 above, I am satisfied that it is reasonable to expect
         the Appellant's two younger children to leave the UK. I am
         consequently satisfied, and for the reasons already given, that it
         would not constitute a disproportionate breach of Article 8 for the
         Appellant to be removed from the UK.

     31. The position is different with regard to TM. She is a much older
         British national child, 13 years old at the date of decision, who,
         on the evidence before me, has a more established life with friends
         and family outside her immediate family unit. Both her maternal
         grandparents live in the UK, as does her paternal grandmother. More
         significantly, TM does not live with the Appellant. She has always
         lived with her mother. VG, TM's mother, is no longer in a
         relationship with the Appellant and, on the evidence presented
         before me, is now in a relationship with another man, TM's
         stepfather. There was no suggestion from the Presenting Officer
         that it would be reasonable to expect VG to relinquish her life in
         UK, including her employment, her current partner, her friends and
         parents, and to relocate with the Appellant to Jamaica.

     32. I remind myself again that s.117B(6) is a self-contained provision.
         Once its conditions are satisfied the public interest will not
         justify removal. S.117B(6), unlike s.117C(5), is singularly focused
         on the issue of the reasonableness of a child leaving the UK. In
         assessing whether it is reasonable to expect TM to leave the UK,
         including the mother with whom she has always lived, I have taken
         into account all of the public interest factors identified in
         paragraph 29 of this decision. Despite the very strong public
         interest in the Appellant's removal I am unable to conclude that it
         would be reasonable to expect TM to leave the United Kingdom. This
         would result in the separation between a 13-year-old girl and the
         mother with whom she has always lived and who is her primary carer.
         Such separation would undoubtedly have a highly detrimental impact
         on TM. It would also result in a 13-year-old leaving everything she
         has known, including her friends and family, and relinquishing her
         entitlement to a British education and access to the NHS which flow
         from her nationality.

     33. Mr Kotas invited me to find that s.117B(6) was predicated on an
         'expectation' that a child would leave the UK. He gave as an
         example a child who was not British but who had lived in the UK for
         more than seven years but whose parents were both facing removal.
         It was submitted that in such a case the child would have an
         expectation of being removed as part of the single family unit. It
         was submitted that in the present case they could be no expectation
         that a 13 year old British national who did not live with the
         Appellant would leave the UK and that, in effect, s.117B(6) did not
         apply.

     34. I cannot accept this submission. S.117B(6) must be read in
         accordance with its ordinary language and in light of its purpose.
         If I were to adopt the construction urged by Mr Kotas there would
         be a separation of the issue whether a child could be expected to
         leave the UK and the reasonableness of the child leaving UK. Given
         that s.117B(6) has been enacted to ensure the welfare of children
         such a separation would be wholly unjustified.

     35. Having found that it would be unreasonable to expect TM to leave
         the UK, and given that the Appellant is not liable to deportation,
         I find, applying MA (Pakistan), that the Appellant's removal would
         constitute a disproportionate breach of Article 8. His appeal is
         consequently allowed.
