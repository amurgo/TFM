Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Wilding, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R. Bartram, Migrant Law Partnership

                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    a First-tier Tribunal panel (Judge Pullig and Dr P  L  Ravenscroft)  to
    allow the appeal of the Respondent  against  the  decision  to  make  a
    deportation order pursuant to Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.



 2. Whilst this is the appeal of the Secretary of State, for convenience we
    will refer to the original Appellant, Mr John Eno Tabi,  a  citizen  of
    Cameroon, born on 17th March 1983, as the Appellant herein.

The Background:

 3. The history is as follows.  The Appellant is a national of Cameroon but
    was born in Nigeria on 17th March  1983.   He  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom on 1st December 1986 when he was 3 years old, in the company of
    his brother, Marvin Ebai Tabi, and his parents.  They are all nationals
    of Cameroon.  There is no evidence that the  Appellant  holds  Nigerian
    nationality but there is evidence and it is accepted and common  ground
    between the parties that he is a national of  Cameroon.  The  Appellant
    was granted indefinite leave on remain on the 2nd February 1991.

 4. On 26th June 2000 the Appellant submitted an  application  for  British
    nationality which was refused on 22nd January  2003.   The  reason  for
    refusal was the Appellant's convictions prior to that date.

 5. The  Appellant  has  a  number  of  criminal  convictions.   The  first
    conviction was on 5th January 2001 at Watford Magistrates'  Court.   He
    was find �150  plus  costs  of  �55  for  using  threatening,  abusive,
    insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear  or  provocation
    of violence on 22nd December 2000.  The Appellant was 18 at that  time.



 6. On 9th March  2001,  the  Appellant  was  convicted  of  possessing  an
    offensive  weapon  in  a  public  place  and  was  fined  �250  with  a
    compensation payment of �50.

 7. On 18th November 2002 at  Uxbridge  Magistrates'  Court  the  Appellant
    received a  conditional  discharge  for  twelve  months  for  attempted
    burglary and theft of a non- dwelling which took place on 25th  October
    2002.

 8. Not long after that on 10th March 2003 the Appellant was  convicted  of
    an offence of theft from a motor vehicle and was fined �200 with  costs
    of �118.

 9. At Harrow Magistrates' Court on  18th  July  2008,  the  Appellant  was
    convicted of carrying an air weapon in a public place and was sentenced
    to a community order with the requirement of unpaid work of 150  hours.
    A forfeiture order was made in respect of the gun.  Also on  that  date
    he was dealt with for the breach of a conditional discharge  which  was
    imposed by the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court from the conviction of  18th
    November 2002 and no action was taken on the breach.  It  appears  that
    the order was subsequently revoked.  The date of that  offence  appears
    to be 1st October 2003 but that he was not dealt with  for  that  until
    18th July 2008.

10. On 18th August 2008 the Appellant was  convicted  for  his  first  drug
    offence, possession of a class A controlled drug, crack  cocaine  which
    he had in his possession on 23rd November 2003, again a period of  time
    between the offence and being dealt with it.  He was fined �100  or  to
    serve one day which was deemed to have been served.

11. On 17th March 2009 the Appellant was convicted at Southend Crown  Court
    of three offences namely possession of a  controlled  drug  (class  C),
    possession of a  class  A  drug  (cocaine)  and  the  possession  of  a
    prohibited weapon namely a handgun.  He received  a  sentence  of  five
    years' imprisonment for the offence relating to the prohibited  weapon,
    a sentence of twelve months' imprisonment consecutive for possession of
    a class A drug and imprisonment of six months to run  concurrently  for
    the offence of possessing a class C controlled drug.   Thus  his  total
    sentence was one of six years' imprisonment.  Orders were also made for
    the forfeiture and destruction of  the  drugs,  paraphernalia  and  the
    weapon.

12. The final conviction shown on the Appellant's antecedent history refers
    to 3rd April 2009 at South-East Essex Magistrates' Court for  a  breach
    of a community order which had been imposed on 18th July 2008 and  that
    order was revoked.

13. The information before the Tribunal also demonstrates that he  received
    a caution from the Essex Police for battery for an offence on 26th July
    2007.

14. On 15th June 2009 the Respondent wrote to the Appellant  informing  him
    that he would be liable to deportation under Section 32(5) of the  2007
    Act and invited him to give details as to why he should not be deported
    and why he fell within exceptions to  the  Act.   A  questionnaire  was
    enclosed which the Appellant returned only  partially  completed  under
    cover of a letter dated 29th June 2009.  The letter explained  that  he
    could not provide all the information required because he had been made
    unable to contact his mother.  He made reference to the  fact  that  he
    had been resident in the UK since  the  age  of  2,  all  five  of  his
    brothers and sisters as well as his parents were citizens of the UK and
    he will try and contact his mother.

15. The Appellant gave further information concerning his circumstances  at
    a later date stating that he had a son Warren George Tribe born on  7th
    November 2004 who was a British national  and  also  a  daughter  named
    Naturelle Celine Marie Tribe born on 16th November 2005.  This  led  to
    the Respondent on 6th April 2011 asking the Appellant for copies of the
    birth certificates of the children and their mother and a copy  of  the
    mother's  current  passport.    Further   information   was   requested
    concerning the relationship and contact that he had with the  children.
    It is not known what, if any, reply was received to that letter sent by
    the Respondent.

16. It is also plain from the correspondence  in  the  Respondent's  bundle
    that letters addressed to Leanne Tribe, the mother of the two  children
    did not reply to those requests that were made by the Respondent.

17. On 9th  October  2012  a  deportation  order  was  signed  against  the
    Appellant and a decision was made that Section 32(5) of the UK  Borders
    Act 2007 applied.  The letter giving reasons for the decision was dated
    11th October 2012.  In summary the decision letter set out the  reasons
    for deportation noting his convictions and in particular those relating
    to the possession of a prohibited weapon and the offences  relating  to
    drugs and his sentence of six years' imprisonment.  Having reviewed the
    facts, including the representations made, it was concluded that he did
    not fall with any of  the  exceptions  from  automatic  deportation  in
    Section 33 of the  UK  Borders  Act  for  the  reasons  set  out.   His
    background and immigration history was taken into account including the
    grant of indefinite leave to remain  on  12th  February  1991  and  his
    criminal convictions.  The sentencing judge's remarks were also set out
    within the decision letter.  As to Article 8, the Respondent considered
    the Immigration Rules by reference to paragraph 398 and 399  and  399A.
    In view of his conviction and sentence of six years'  imprisonment  and
    therefore in excess of the four years set out in paragraph 398, it  was
    noted that it  would  only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  a
    person's right to private or family life would be outweighed.   It  was
    noted that the Appellant's parents and siblings were  resident  in  the
    United Kingdom but whilst he had indefinite leave to remain, it was not
    known what legitimate  employment  he  had  ever  held  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

18. As to whether there  were  exceptional  circumstances,  the  Respondent
    considered the Appellant's family life and his children.  It was  noted
    that there was a lack of evidence to substantiate this, because  Leanne
    Tribe had failed to respond to communications sent  to  her  and  there
    were  no  birth  certificates  submitted,  that  she  had  visited  the
    Appellant once since he had been in prison  without  the  children  and
    that he did not maintain contact with either of the  children  referred
    to.  It was not accepted that he had  a  subsisting  relationship  with
    Leanne Tribe and there was no evidence that he and the family had lived
    together as a family unit.

19. In relation to the Appellant's private life, the Respondent noted  that
    he had lived in the United Kingdom for 26 years but had not raised  any
    further  grounds  to  suggest   that   there   were   any   exceptional
    circumstances.  It was said that he had ties to Cameroon  and  that  he
    had lived there for 2� years with his parents before accompanying  them
    to the United Kingdom at the age of 3.  Also at the age of  10  he  had
    spent a year in Cameroon with his parents and siblings before returning
    to the United Kingdom.  It was further noted that  whilst  his  parents
    have been settled in the United Kingdom, they had spent most  of  their
    life in Cameroon thus there was no reason why he would not be  able  to
    readjust to life in that country.  His relationship  with  his  parents
    and siblings did not constitute family life, as they  were  adults  and
    there were no elements of dependency beyond the normal emotional  ties.
    The Secretary of State concluded that deportation would not violate the
    Appellant's rights under Article 8 or  any  other  Articles  under  the
    Human Rights Convention.

The Proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal:

20. The Appellant exercised his right  to  appeal  that  decision  and  the
    appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal panel, consisting of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Pullig and Dr Ravenscroft at Hatton  Cross  on  8th
    April 2013.

21. The Appellant appeared before the panel  unrepresented.   It  is  plain
    from the determination that  he  had  previously  been  represented  by
    solicitors but they had withdrawn representation at a  later  date  and
    asked for their name to be removed from the Tribunal's records.

22. The panel heard evidence from the Appellant which they set out in their
    determination at paragraphs 30 to 49.  At the end of that evidence they
    heard submissions from each of the parties which they recorded in their
    determination.  The panel then turned  to  the  law  that  they  should
    apply.  In respect of the Immigration Rules, they found that paragraphs
    399 and 399A  did  not  apply  as  those  provisions  only  related  to
    convictions giving rise to a sentence of less than four years or  where
    deportation was conducive to the public good because that was the  view
    of the Secretary of State in the light of the offending causing serious
    harm  or  being  persistent.   Thus  they  found  that  "the  issue  of
    exceptional circumstances or the length of the Appellant's residence in
    this country, under the Immigration Rules, simply  is  not  an  issue".
    They recorded that the Appellant therefore could not succeed under  the
    Immigration Rules and that "the only basis for the Appellant's case  is
    Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention."

23. The panel identified that in this case the Appellant's rights under the
    Human Rights Convention would apply and they set out a number of  self-
    directions concerning the  law  including  that  of  Maslov  v  Austria
    (Application 1638/03) and the criteria of Boultif and Uner.  The  panel
    then made reference to the evidence  before  them  concerning  the  two
    children  in  question.   Warren  Tribe,  who  was  his  "stepson"  and
    Naturelle Tribe who was his biological daughter.  The panel noted  that
    they had no documentary evidence regarding the children and that  their
    mother had failed to respond to the letters  sent  by  the  Respondent.
    They considered that in the light of  the  explanation  that  they  had
    heard that she may have been in prison  at  the  time  or  subsequently
    suffered mental health problems, that may be the reason why  there  was
    no answer to that correspondence.  They also recorded that the children
    had been in the care of the Social Services by way of foster care.   As
    to contact that the Appellant had, the panel noted  that  he  had  last
    seen his daughter before he went to prison in September 2008  when  she
    was 7 at the time.  It was further recorded  the  Appellant's  evidence
    that he had spoken to the children on the telephone when  their  mother
    had visited.  The panel made reference to the OASys Report (section  3)
    in which Ms Tribe was referred to as his "girlfriend"  and  at  section
    6.7, the police caution of July 2007 which related to an assault on his
    partner.  The  Tribunal  noted  that  there  was  no  response  to  the
    directions given by them to obtain information about the  children  but
    that the Tribunal was not obliged  to  pursue  enquiries  any  further.
    They noted that they had no information as to the level of contact that
    Warren's biological father had with him.  At  paragraph  73  they  said
    this:-

         "We acknowledge the Appellant's  contact  with  both  children,  of
         course of greater importance is that with his biological  daughter.
         We also acknowledge the Appellant's wish to  re-establish  contact,
         as it has been interrupted by  four  years'  separation.   However,
         whilst their best interests would involve contact if  not  actually
         living with both  parents,  we  cannot  say,  beyond  that  general
         principle, very much more about the bests interests of either child
         and that, on the evidence, cannot bear any significant weight."

24. The panel then turned  to  the  case  law  relating  to  Article  8  in
    deportation appeals.  They set out the  decision  of  the  Tribunal  in
    Masih (deportation -  public  interest  -  basic  principles)  Pakistan
    [2012] UKUT 0046 (IAC) and then set out at length what was said by Laws
    J in SS (Nigeria) (see paragraphs 76 to 84).  The  panel  proceeded  to
    make what they described as "two observations  on  SS  (Nigeria)",  the
    first was that as in the present case, the Article 8 claim  related  to
    the Appellant's relationship with his child.  They concluded that  they
    had dealt with the best interests of the children in the appeal but did
    not find  that  to  be  a  significantly  strong  factor.   The  second
    observation related to the reference  to  Maslov  and  the  nature  and
    seriousness  of  the  offence.   They  recorded  that  what   was   not
    specifically mentioned in SS (Nigeria) were  the  matters  set  out  in
    Maslov at paragraphs 72 to 75 and  for  the  relevance  of  this  case,
    paragraphs 74 to 75.  At paragraph 82 they quoted Laws LJ that  not  to
    effect deportation can only be justified by a very strong claim indeed.
     They found that the Appellant had come to the UK when he was  2  years
    old or at the age of 3 and was granted indefinite leave  to  remain  on
    2nd February 1991 when just under 8 years of age.  They found him to be
    a settled migrant who had now spent lawfully all of his  life  in  this
    country save for a brief absence in  Cameroon.   Thus  they  considered
    that "the use of the term 'very serious reasons'  in  paragraph  75  of
    Maslov suggests that someone coming within that  concept  does  have  a
    very strong claim indeed even if the Appellant does not fall within the
    last sentence of that paragraph in Maslov."

25. The panel then turned to a consideration of the Appellant's case.  They
    began by considering the length of the sentence and the seriousness  of
    the offence.  In this context they considered the OASys assessment  and
    the work that the Appellant had undertaken in prison.  They noted  that
    the OASys Report was completed in June  2009  and  there  had  been  no
    update or later assessment.  Turning to the risk, they quoted from  the
    OASys Report at paragraph 88 noting that he had been assessed as a "low
    risk for other offences, i.e., non violent or  sexual  offences  within
    two years of release as 'low medium'."  As to risk of reconviction  for
    violent offences that results in  imprisonment,  within  two  years  of
    release "some".   However  they  also  noted  "summary  sheet  risk  of
    reconviction" that he was shown as having a high risk of  reconviction.
    As to the assessment of risk of harm, reference was  made  to  this  at
    paragraph 89.  The Appellant posed a low risk in  custody  but  a  high
    risk of harm to the public, medium risk to a known adult and  low  risk
    to children and staff.  It was further recorded that

         "Those at risk are potential victims and society as a  whole.   The
         Appellant had said  that  he  had  been  a  drug  dealer  prior  to
         conviction who had kept a gun for protection.  The risk of harm are
         from drugs offered and potential discharge of  the  firearm.   When
         the Appellant is released that risk is likely to be the greatest if
         he returns to his previous lifestyle.  Any return to the misuse  of
         drugs and alcohol would be a concern."

    The panel recorded at paragraph 90 that the factor that  is  likely  to
    reduce the risk include the statement the Appellant would like to start
    a promotion business with friends and if successful he would not return
    to reoffending.

26. They noted at paragraph 91 that he had  not  been  assessed  for  MAPPA
    (Multi Agency Public Protection Panel) and  at  section  5  there  were
    risks of objectives to reduce the risk of  harm  involving  undertaking
    courses including a CARAT course in relation to drugs.  The panel noted
    however "We  have  no  evidence  of  what  happened  if  the  Appellant
    undertook that course but we do have evidence in other respects."   The
    panel then considered at paragraphs 92 to 93 the courses  that  he  had
    undertaken namely a post-programme report  concerning  thinking  skills
    and problem solving.  They considered that the  report  showed  overall
    that he had made significant progress, that he had "displayed openness"
    and was "a very supportive member of the group".  They found  that  the
    report was "encouraging".   The  other  certificates  produced  by  the
    Appellant related to undertaking  a  course  in  victim  awareness  and
    restorative justice in  September  2011  and  that  he  had  undertaken
    various units in personal and social development.  At paragraph 94 they
    noted that he had had four adjudications in prison  in  the  course  of
    2010 but none of them indicated any  antisocial  features.   The  panel
    concluded at paragraph 95

         "Whilst we cannot make our own risk assessment the preponderance of
         the evidence points clearly to the risks involved being  less  than
         originally assessed (in spite of the contradictions) because of the
         work undertaken by the Appellant in  prison,  work  that  had  been
         identified as being required to reduce the risk."

    They then made reference to the Appellant's criminal record noting that
    save for the index offence, all are comparatively minor.  None involved
    a prison sentence save in 2008 for possession of a class A drug,  crack
    cocaine, where he received a fine of �100 or one  day  deemed  to  have
    been served.

27. As to their conclusions at paragraphs 97 to  98  they  found  that  the
    Appellant had established private life in  the  United  Kingdom  having
    been in the United Kingdom since the age of 2 or 3 and that  it  was  a
    "very strong case indeed and when one adds to that the presence  of  at
    least  a  child  here,  although  her  best  interests  do  not   weigh
    significantly in the balance, we find that these do outweigh the public
    interest concerns under Article 8."  Thus they allowed the appeal.

The Proceedings before the Upper Tribunal:

28. Permission was sought to appeal  that  decision  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, permission being granted  on  23rd  August  2013  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Brunnen.  The reasons for  granting  permission  are  as
    follows:-

         "The submission in paragraph 3 of the grounds that the panel should
         have considered whether there were  any  exceptional  circumstances
         that justified not deporting the Appellant is arguable.  The  panel
         arguably misdirected itself in paragraph 57 of  the  determination.
         Although paragraphs 399 and 399A do not apply where a  sentence  of
         at least four years' imprisonment has  been  passed,  it  is  still
         necessary  under  paragraph  398  to  consider  whether  there  are
         exceptional circumstances.  It is arguable (following MF) that  the
         answer this question should have been taken into consideration when
         deciding the issue of proportionality when  considering  Article  8
         outside the Immigration Rules.

         It is arguable that when assessing proportionality at paragraphs 85
         to 96 the panel erred by considering only the risk  of  reoffending
         and left out of consideration the wider aspects of the principle of
         deterrents identified in  cases  such  AM  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1634,
         Richards [2013] EWCA Civ 244 and SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550".

29. Thus the hearing came before the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  Secretary  of
    State  was  represented  by  Mr  Wilding  and  the  Appellant  appeared
    unrepresented.  Mr Wilding relied upon the  grounds.   In  addition  he
    made the following submissions.  He submitted that the panel  erred  in
    their  proportionality  assessment  at  paragraphs  85  to  96  of  the
    determination, in that there was a  real  lack  of  engagement  with  a
    proper balancing exercise.  In their determination at paragraphs 79  to
    84, the Tribunal undertook an analysis of SS  (Nigeria)  which  was  in
    parts correct but in other parts was misconstrued.  At paragraph 81 the
    Tribunal had set out the relevant parts of Maslov but missed the  point
    made by Laws LJ at paragraph 28 of SS (Nigeria).  In Maslov, the  court
    considered the Austrian  Aliens  Act  and  the  provisions  under  that
    statute did not compare with the 2007 Act and  legislative  policy  and
    therefore greater  weight  was  attached  compared  with  the  pre-2007
    executive policy.  At paragraph 28 Lord Justice Laws commented that the
    decision of Maslov did not engage with this important  point  and  that
    where a policy is made by the legislature (rather than  the  executive)
    that has to play a greater part in the balance.  He submitted that  the
    panel had missed the point made by  Lord  Justice  Laws  and  that  the
    closest that the Tribunal got to  it  was  at  paragraph  82.   However
    whilst they made reference to the weight to be attached to the  State's
    policy, in fact very little consideration as to what was in the  public
    interest and  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  it  featured  in  this
    determination.  He submitted that the panel fell into the same trap  as
    identified by the Court of Appeal in Gurung at paragraph  21  and  that
    much of the determination has the appearance of a  search  for  reasons
    for not deporting him rather than an enquiry into whether, despite  the
    statutory policy of automatic deportation, Article 8 of the  Convention
    would be violated by its implementation.

30. Mr Wilding further submitted that they failed to take into account  the
    seriousness of the offences and made reference at paragraph 88  to  the
    "low medium" risk, rather than the fact that he had received a sentence
    of six years' imprisonment.  He further submitted  that  what  was  not
    clear from the balancing act carried out by  the  panel  was  that  the
    Appellant was in fact convicted of three offences; two  in  respect  of
    class A and class C drugs and also what the panel referred  to  as  the
    "index offence".  The panel failed to engage with  the  offences  as  a
    whole and fell into error at paragraph 96 when making a summary of  the
    offences and their level of seriousness.  Similarly  when  setting  out
    the sentencing remarks, no reference was made to the offences  relating
    to drugs for which he also received a period of imprisonment.  Thus  it
    was submitted,  there  was  a  lack  of  understanding  concerning  the
    Appellant's offending.

31. Mr Wilding submitted that the panel failed to take  into  account  that
    the Appellant failed to meet the Immigration Rules (Article 8) and that
    those were Rules where an expression of where the  Secretary  of  State
    said the balance lay and this had been endorsed by Parliament thus when
    the Rules are not met, that must weigh  heavily  in  the  balance.   He
    submitted that this was part as a result of a misinterpretation  of  SS
    (Nigeria) and their failure to properly weigh up  the  concept  of  the
    legislative scheme under the 2007 Act.  He reminded the  Tribunal  that
    this was not a case that involved significant family ties and  that  it
    was plain from the determination of the panel that it was the length of
    residence that the panel considered was the factor that outweighed  the
    public interest.  However there had been no assessment of  his  private
    life save that he had been in the United Kingdom since he was  3  years
    of age.  Whilst not downplaying the length of residence, there  was  no
    evidence concerning matters of his private life concerning his work  or
    other community ties which had been established by this Appellant.   In
    view of that, and the fact that a very strong claim indeed  would  only
    succeed and therefore pointing to a high threshold, there were a number
    of matters  missing  from  the  assessment.   Much  of  the  assessment
    referred to the risk of reoffending by reference to courses carried out
    but the panel had failed in its  assessment  to  properly  balance  the
    public interest, the fact that he could not meet the Rules and the lack
    of evidence concerning the nature of his private life  which  therefore
    amounted to a material error of law.

32. As to the issue of deterrence, the panel solely looked at the  risk  of
    reoffending and failed to consider the wider  public  interest  of  the
    deterrent effect deportation has upon migrants to the  United  Kingdom.
    In summary the only factor in this case weighed in the balance was  the
    Appellant's length of residence despite there being a lack of  evidence
    concerning the nature  of  that  private  life  and  how  it  would  be
    interfered with and a greater depth of analysis  was  required  by  the
    Tribunal of the public interest including the concept of deterrence and
    the legislative policy underlying the 2007 Act.

33. At the conclusion of those submissions we heard from Mr Tabi.  He  gave
    an impassioned plea before us that when  he  had  appeared  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal he appeared without representation  and  had  "told
    the truth".  He said that he had not denied his criminal  activity  and
    tried  to  address  the  issues  concerning  reducing   his   risk   of
    reoffending.  As to his private life, he said that he had been  in  the
    United Kingdom since he was 3 and  that  he  must  have  established  a
    private life during that period of time given the  length  of  it.   He
    told us that when he had received the information  to  say  his  appeal
    allowed he was extremely happy but when he had heard the  Secretary  of
    State had been granted permission to appeal he  had  become  depressed.
    He told us that he had lived "a certain kind of lifestyle" and that  he
    had been a criminal and that he had made choices in his life.  He  said
    that if he had a life in Cameroon he would have said so.

34. As to his family, he said that all  his  family  members  were  in  the
    United Kingdom and that he would like to re-establish ties  with  them.
    When asked why there were no witnesses at  the  hearing  the  Appellant
    said that he had been "away for a long time.  I did get into a  lot  of
    trouble as a juvenile my parents have  six  children,  I'm  the  second
    eldest and the last three were born in the United Kingdom.  I had a lot
    of falling out with them ....".  The Appellant said that his mother had
    told him that "You are an adult and sort your life out".  The Appellant
    was therefore stating that he had  not  had  contact  with  his  family
    members although he would like to re-establish contact with them  at  a
    later date.  As to his partner, he confirmed that she was  now  out  of
    prison but that they were "not on speaking terms".

35. As to future plans, he said that he wished  to  enrol  in  college  and
    undertake coaching for football which he would not be able to do if  he
    was deported to Cameroon.  He told us  that  he  thought  that  he  was
    British.  He reiterated that he had addressed his reoffending and  that
    he would wish to re-establish  ties  with  his  parents  and  also  his
    children.

36. Mr Wilding did not make any further reply.

37. We reserved our decision.  We indicated to the parties that if we found
    an error of law and set  aside  the  decision  that  it  would  require
    another hearing.  Thus we reserved our determination.

Conclusions on the Error of Law

38. In a decision promulgated on the  18th  October  2013  we  reached  the
    conclusion that the Secretary of State had made  out  her  grounds  and
    that the determination when analysed did disclose an error  of  law  in
    its approach.

39. The reasons we gave are as follows:

    "39.     We consider that the  panel  failed  to  properly  assess  and
    attach appropriate weight to the public  interest  identified  in  this
    appeal.  In particular, that the panel failed to weigh in  the  balance
    the fact that the Appellant could not meet the requirements of  Article
    8 as expressed in the Immigration Rules.  The panel said this about the
    Immigration Rules at paragraphs 55 and 57:-

         "55. We need to deal below, albeit very briefly with the provisions
             of the Immigration Rules.  These are  set  out  in  paragraphs
             398, 399 and 339A.  However for  reasons  to  which  we  shall
             come, and on which subject we agree  with  Ms  Pos,  only  398
             applies.

         ...

         57.  Notwithstanding what is said in the letter giving reasons  for
             the decision, paragraphs 399 and 399A do not  apply  as  those
             provisions  only  relate  to  convictions  giving  rise  to  a
             sentence of less than  four  years  or  where  deportation  is
             conducive to the public good because that is the view  of  the
             Secretary of State in  the  light  of  the  offending  causing
             serious  harm  or  being  persistent.   Thus  the   issue   of
             exceptional circumstances or the  length  of  the  Appellant's
             residence in this country, under the Immigration Rules, simply
             is not an issue.   The  Appellant  cannot  succeed  under  the
             Immigration Rules and thus the only basis of  the  Appellant's
             case is Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention to  which  we
             shall then turn."

       40. We find that the panel misdirected itself in  law  at  paragraph
       57.  The first step undertaken under the  new  Rules  is  to  decide
       whether deportation would be contrary to an individual's  Article  8
       rights on the grounds as to whether the case falls within  paragraph
       399 or 399A.  Here as identified by the  panel  paragraphs  399  and
       399A do not apply because the case fell within paragraph 398(a)  due
       to the length of sentence being one in excess of four years.  Whilst
       the panel did acknowledge that, they erroneously  stated  that  "the
       issue of exceptional  circumstances  under  the  Immigration  Rules,
       simply is not an issue".  However the new Rules provide that in  the
       event that paragraph 399 or 399A do not apply, "it will only  be  in
       exceptional circumstances that the public  interest  in  deportation
       will be outweighed by other factors."  Whilst the panel acknowledged
       that the Appellant could not succeed under  the  Immigration  Rules,
       the fact that the Appellant would have  to  demonstrate  exceptional
       circumstances  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  was  a  relevant
       consideration in the balancing  exercise  as  was  the  weight  that
       should have been attached to the fact that he  could  not  meet  the
       Immigration Rules.

   41. As set out in the decision of the Tribunal in MF (Article  8  -  new
       Rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC), the Tribunal dealt with  the
       new Rules and the public  interest  at  paragraphs  42  to  48.   At
       paragraphs 42 to 43 they said this:-

         "New rules and the public interest

         42.  There is, however, at least one important respect in which the
             new  rules  affect  the  second-stage  Article  8  assessment.
             Previously judges' understanding of the weight  the  Secretary
             of State attaches to the public interest side of the Article 8
             balancing  exercise  had  largely  to  be  gleaned  from   the
             submissions of the Secretary of State in  leading  cases.   It
             has fallen very much to the judicial system to  give  it  form
             and content.  In deportation cases involving foreign criminals
             s.32 of the 2007 Act gave clear  parliamentary  expression  to
             the particular importance the Secretary of State  attached  to
             their deportation: see MK (deportation-foreign criminal-public
             interest) Gambia [2010]  UKUT  281  (IAC);  AP  (Trinidad  and
             Tobago)  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  551  per  Carnwath  LJ;  Gurung  v
             Secretary of State for the Home Department EWCA  Civ  62.  Now
             more generally, greater specificity is given in the new  rules
             as to what circumstances are  seen  to  attract  the  greatest
             weight in respect of the public  interest;  the  Secretary  of
             State has now herself  told  us  what  factors  she  considers
             relevant and what weight at the general level she attaches  to
             them. In particular, in the context of deportation of  foreign
             criminals, the new rules set out thresholds of criminality (by
             reference to length of terms  of  imprisonment)  so  that  the
             Article 8 private life claims brought by foreign criminals can
             only succeed (unless there are exceptional  circumstances)  if
             they not only have certain periods of residence but  can  also
             show their criminality has fallen below these thresholds.


         43.  That must and should properly inform our Article 8  assessment
             made in compliance with our s.6  obligations  under  the  HRA.
             Whereas previously it has been open to judges, within  certain
             limits, to reach their own view of what the public interest is
             and the weight to be attached to it, the scope for doing so is
             now more limited."

    As the Court of Appeal has stated, the new Rules were an index  of  the
    enhanced importance the Secretary  of  State  attaches  to  the  public
    interest in the deportation of foreign criminals.  The  fact  that  the
    Appellant had failed to meet the requirements of the new  Rules  was  a
    "very significant consideration".  The Court of Appeal have  considered
    the effect of the new Rules and whether they have affected any  change.
    At paragraphs 40-41 they said this:-

         "40. Does it follow that the new  rules  have  effected  no  change
             other than to spell out the circumstances in which  a  foreign
             criminal's claim that deportation would breach his  article  8
             rights will succeed?   At this point, it is necessary to focus
             on  the  statement  that  it  will  only  be  "in  exceptional
             circumstances that the public interest in deportation will  be
             outweighed by other factors". Ms Giovannetti submits that  the
             reference to exceptional circumstances serves the  purpose  of
             emphasising that, in  the  balancing  exercise,  great  weight
             should be given to the public interest  in  deporting  foreign
             criminals who do not satisfy paras 398 and 399 or  399A.    It
             is only exceptionally that such foreign criminals will succeed
             in showing that their rights  under  article  8(1)  trump  the
             public interest in their deportation.


         41.  We  accept  this  submission.    In  view  of  the  strictures
             contained at para 20 of Huang, it would have  been  surprising
             if the Secretary of  State  had  intended  to  reintroduce  an
             exceptionality   test,   thereby   flouting   the   Strasbourg
             jurisprudence.  At first sight, the choice of the  phrase  "in
             exceptional circumstances" might suggest that this is what she
             purported to do.  But the phrase has been used in a way  which
             was not intended to have this effect  in  all  cases  where  a
             state wishes to remove a foreign national who relies on family
             life which he established at a time when  he  knew  it  to  be
             "precarious" (because he had no right to remain  in  the  UK).
             The cases were helpfully reviewed by Sales J in  R  (Nagre)  v
             Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2013]  EWHC  720
             (Admin).   The fact  that  Nagre  was  not  a  case  involving
             deportation  of  a  foreign  criminal  is  immaterial.     The
             significance of the case law lies in the repeated use  by  the
             ECtHR of the phrase "exceptional circumstances".  "


       Thus  the  Court  of  Appeal  concluded  at  paragraph  42  that  in
       approaching the question  of  whether  removal  is  a  proportionate
       interference with an individual's Article 8 rights, the  scales  are
       heavily  weighted  in  favour  of  deportation  and  something  very
       compelling (which will be "exceptional") is required to outweigh the
       public interest in removal.  As they noted "In our  view  it  is  no
       coincidence that the phrase 'exceptional circumstances' is  used  in
       the new Rules in the context of weighing the competing  factors  for
       and against deportation of foreign criminals."

   42. Thus in those circumstances we find the  panel  failed  to  consider
       that in the balancing exercise and failed to attach  weight  to  the
       consideration that the Appellant  could  not  meet  the  Immigration
       Rules.

   43. We also find that the panel failed to have regard and weight to  the
       public interest when carrying out the balancing exercise  under  the
       second stage test when considering the "classic" Article 8.   Whilst
       the Secretary of State makes some criticism of the panel's  approach
       to their discussion of the decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in  SS
       (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 550 which the  panel  addressed  at
       great length between paragraphs 76 and 81, we find that even if  the
       panel digressed when considering that jurisprudence, important as it
       is, there was some recognition that the weight to be attached to the
       State's policy is greater because it is expressed now in legislative
       policy rather than by the executive  and  that  what  the  Court  of
       Appeal said in SS (Nigeria) at paragraph 54 that:-

         "... They also clearly show  that  the  more  pressing  the  public
         interest in removal or deportation, the stronger must be the  claim
         under Article 8 if it is to prevail.  The pressing  nature  of  the
         public interest here is  vividly  informed  by  the  fact  that  by
         Parliament's expressed declaration the public interest  is  injured
         if the criminal's deportation is not effected.  Such a result could
         in my judgment only be justified by a very strong claim indeed."

   44. However whilst the panel made reference  to  that  consideration  at
       paragraph 82, it is not sufficient to make a reference to it but  it
       must be demonstrated  that  that  was  a  factor  in  the  balancing
       exercise.  We do not consider that the panel did attach  the  weight
       to that factor as indicated in the  decision  of  SS  (Nigeria)  (as
       cited).  The only factor identified by the panel was the Appellant's
       private life on the basis that he was  a  settled  migrant  who  had
       spent lawfully his life in the United Kingdom since he was  the  age
       of 3 (see paragraph 84).  However the panel  did  not  identify  any
       evidence as to the strength and type of private life it was said the
       Appellant had built up during that time; for example the strength of
       ties, employment, links with the community.  The  panel  placed,  we
       consider, undue weight on the fact of the length of residence  alone
       without more.  This was not a case in which there  was  any  "family
       life" in view of the findings made by the panel relating to the lack
       of evidence in respect of  his  family  members,  and  that  of  his
       previous partner.  Nor did the panel find there was any  significant
       weight attached to the Appellant's children with whom he had had  no
       contact since 2008.  Thus in those circumstances, it  was  incumbent
       on the panel to identify the nature of the private life rather  than
       placing emphasis only on the length of a residence.

   45. We also find the panel erred in its consideration of the seriousness
       of the offences when carrying out the  balancing  exercise.   Whilst
       the panel identified that that was a factor that must be put in  the
       balance (see paragraph 85) the panel did not take into  account  the
       totality of the Appellant's offending and that he had been convicted
       of three offences and not simply one offence which they referred  to
       throughout the determination as the "index offence",  which  related
       to the possession  of  a  prohibited  weapon  when  considering  the
       seriousness  of  the  offence.   In  this  case  the  Appellant  was
       convicted of three offences; the possession of a  prohibited  weapon
       and possession of class A and class C drugs.  The  panel  said  this
       about the seriousness of the offences at paragraph 96:-

         "Save for the index offence, the offences in  the  Appellant's  PNC
         are all comparatively minor.  None involving a prison sentence save
         in 2008 for possession of a class A drug, crack cocaine,  where  he
         received a fine of �100 or one day deemed to have been served."

   46. Throughout the determination the panel refer to the "index  offence"
       relating to the prohibited weapon (we refer to paragraph 13, 16  and
       paragraph 96).  The panel also only set out the  sentencing  remarks
       in respect of the "index offence" at paragraph 15 and do not set out
       or make any reference to the sentencing remarks in  respect  of  the
       drugs offences (see paragraph 16).  It is plain that  the  Appellant
       was sentenced to three  offences,  not  only  the  possession  of  a
       prohibited weapon but also for the possession of drugs.  Looking  at
       his antecedent history,  this  was  not  the  first  conviction  for
       offences involving weapons.  On 9th March 2001 he was  convicted  of
       possessing an offensive weapon in a public place.  On 18th July 2008
       he was convicted of  carrying  an  air  weapon  in  a  public  place
       therefore this was the third offence  relating  to  a  weapon.   The
       circumstances of the offence are also relevant.  They indicate  that
       the prohibited weapon was found when a police raid had  taken  place
       at his home and a handgun was found in his safe along with the class
       A and class C drugs (cocaine and cannabis).  The barrel of  the  gun
       had been drilled and the Appellant's own account in the OASys Report
       was that the Appellant had been a drug dealer before his  conviction
       who had kept a gun for his protection.  In those  circumstances  the
       offence relating to the possession  of  the  prohibited  weapon  was
       closely linked to the drugs offences and thus merited consideration.



   47. We do  not  consider  that  paragraph  96  adequately  reflects  the
       seriousness of the offences.  Whilst  it  is  true  that  the  other
       offences did not involve a prison sentence, the panel failed to have
       regard that this was the third time the Appellant had been convicted
       of offences concerning possession of a weapon and  the  second  time
       for drugs offences  and  thus  demonstrated  an  escalation  in  the
       seriousness of his offending.  Whilst the panel quoted  Maslov  they
       did not take account of the fact that these  serious  offences  were
       committed at the time when the Appellant was an adult.

   48. We also consider that when the  panel  assessed  proportionality  at
       paragraphs 85 to 96 they erred  by  considering  only  the  risk  of
       reoffending and left out of consideration the wider aspects  of  the
       principle of deterrence as identified in cases such AM  [2012]  EWCA
       Civ 1634, and Richards [2013] EWCA Civ 244.  The legitimate  aim  of
       prevention of crime is not confined  to  those  who  are  likely  to
       reoffend and the case law indicates that in serious cases  affecting
       public confidence in the criminal justice and  immigration  systems,
       deportation of offenders  has  a  legitimate  role  of  playing  the
       deterrence of others who  might  be  minded  to  offend.   Thus  the
       private interest of an Appellant against the public interests of the
       State, which Judge LJ (as he then was) summarised in  N  (Kenya)  as
       being "broad issues of social cohesion and public confidence of  the
       administration of the system by which control is exercised over non-
       British citizens who enter and remain in the United Kingdom.

   49. We do not find that the panel weighed that  matter  in  the  balance
       when making an assessment of the public interest. "

40. Thus we  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   We
    indicated to the parties that if we found an error of law that it would
    require the parties' attendance at a resumed hearing.  As  regards  the
    findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  we  found  no  error  in  their
    findings relating to the family life of the  Appellant  but  considered
    that in relation to his private life that is an  issue  which  required
    further consideration.

41. The appeal was listed before us on the 6th December. At that hearing Mr
    Bartram appeared on behalf of  the  Appellant.  He  had  recently  been
    instructed to act on his behalf but did not have access to his file  or
    any of the documentation necessary for the appeal to proceed. In  those
    circumstances he requested an adjournment to take further  instructions
    and to prepare for the resumed  hearing.  We  considered  that  it  was
    necessary in the interests of justice for the adjournment to be granted
    and for the appellant to be represented and gave further directions for
    hearing of the appeal. The case  was  subsequently  listed  before  the
    Upper Tribunal.

The Resumed Hearing:

42. The documentation that was put  before  the  Tribunal  consisted  of  a
    witness statement of the Appellant, a copy of a Post  Programme  Report
    dated 21st March 2011 and a letter from the detention  support  project
    manager dated 18th December 2013.   The  documentation  that  had  been
    presented by the Appellant himself before the First-tier  Tribunal  was
    also available.  It also included a certificate for his  attendance  at
    the Restore Programme (Victim Awareness and Restorative  Justice  2011)
    and a series of certificates from the OCR.  Mr Bartram who appeared  on
    behalf of the Appellant also produced a skeleton argument and a copy of
    the decision of the Tribunal in BK (Deportation - S33 "exception"  UKBA
    [2007] - public interest) Ghana [2010] UKUT 328 (IAC).

43. On behalf of the Respondent, we had before us the original Respondent's
    bundle  containing  the  trial  record  sheet,  indictment,  antecedent
    history  of  the  Appellant,  sentencing  remarks,  the  liability   to
    detention deport letter dated  15th  June  2009,  the  application  for
    naturalisation as a  British  citizen  made  on  19th  June  2000,  the
    responses to the liability of deportation letter with enclosures  dated
    15th  June  2009,  request  letters  sent  to  the  Appellant  and  the
    deportation decision dated 11th October 2012.  Mr Wilding, who appeared
    on behalf of the Secretary of State also produced a  skeleton  argument
    and relied upon a number of decisions, Balogun  v  The  United  Kingdom
    [2012] ECHR 614, SS (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 550, JO (Uganda) v
    SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 10, Richards v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 244, Maslov  v
    Austria [2008] ECHR 546, MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.

44. We also heard oral evidence from the Appellant, Mr Tabi, in  accordance
    with the statement submitted and exhibited in the  Appellant's  bundle.
    In his evidence-in-chief he confirmed that the  evidence  that  he  had
    given before the First-tier Tribunal was the truth.  He was asked about
    his  criminal  history  and  in  particular  he  was  referred  to  the
    sentencing remarks of the  judge  in  which  he  had  referred  to  the
    Appellant being addicted to drugs.  The Appellant confirmed that he was
    using cocaine and cannabis.  He was referred  to  the  probation  OASys
    report (7.1) in which it was said he took drugs for others and  he  was
    asked about what happened.  The Appellant stated that  he  was  "messed
    up" and was "doing a lot of things" and that he thought "he  could  cut
    corners to make money."  He confirmed that he had done  "silly  things"
    like that.  He was also referred to the OASys report in  which  he  had
    described himself as a drug dealer before being in custody and asked to
    explain where his source of income came from.  He confirmed  that  when
    he left college he had had "little jobs" and a friend  had  a  painting
    business but his money mainly came from criminal  activities.   He  was
    further asked about gang related activities referred to  in  the  OASys
    report (at 7.1).  He stated that he was not part of a named gang but  a
    group of friends who were committing criminal activities and  therefore
    from the outside it would look like a gang  but  we  were  a  group  of
    people doing "illegal stuff" as we were criminal associates we  were  a
    gang.

45. In respect of the offences themselves, he confirmed that the indictment
    was correct, that his accommodation was raided and  they  had  found  a
    drilled weapon and drugs, cocaine of 12.27 grams and cannabis of  141.2
    grams.

46. He was asked about the TSP Post Programme Course that he  had  attended
    and to summarise the changes in his behaviour.   The  Appellant  stated
    that he went on the course at first without an open mind but considered
    that it made him really "stop and think" and made  him  think  "outside
    the box" and that he would stop doing things.  He  stated  that  before
    there was a danger and he personally thought that the course had helped
    him quite a lot.

47. He was asked about his connection to the Cameroon.  He stated that  his
    parents were from Cameroon and had been there and he always  knew  that
    he had Cameroonian roots but as far  as  he  knew  he  had  been  there
    briefly and that he knew that  they  spoke  French  and  he  remembered
    saying to his mum when he was in Cameroon "When are we going home?"  He
    said that he could pick up some French and understand  some  but  could
    not really understand enough if he were  living  in  France.   He  said
    Cameroon was part of his background but  it  was  "not  me".   He  said
    "Cameroon is not my country of birth".  It was  put  to  him  that  the
    drugs offences were very serious and that it was in the public interest
    to deport him and he  was  asked  to  explain  why  he  should  not  be
    deported.  The Appellant said that he believed that he was British  and
    that everything about him was British and that he knew that he had done
    wrong but he had put it behind him.  He said he did not smoke or  drink
    and did not do drugs and that in his view he should not be deported.

48. In cross-examination he was asked  about  his  criminal  activity.   He
    confirmed that the only source of income that  he  had  came  from  his
    criminal activity and that was by selling drugs.  It  was  put  to  him
    that in the OASys report he had confirmed, as he had in oral  evidence,
    that he was a drug dealer and that he would return to this  on  release
    (5.2).  He was asked in those circumstances  what  confidence  did  the
    Tribunal have that he would not return to drug dealing on release?   He
    stated that the OASys report was made early on and at that time he  was
    "still fiery, still aggressive and stubborn" and that his "mindset  was
    that I didn't care".  He explained that he was 25 then and now  he  was
    31 and that he was a different person.  He said that the  courses  that
    he had gone on had led him to see things "in a  different  light".   He
    said he could only do his best to try to prove he had changed.  He  was
    then asked about what actual plans he had  to  find  work  outside  his
    criminality.  The Appellant said that he  had  spoken  to  a  probation
    officer three weeks ago and had seen the duty officer and that they had
    recently said that they would help him.  He said he was quite  involved
    in music and would like to do a sound engineering course at college  or
    undertake football coaching which would cost �300 to  obtain  level  B.
    He thought the probation officer could assist him in obtaining work.

49.   In respect of his current position he was asked if  he  had  had  any
    further contact with his children or ex-partner  since  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing.  In respect of his children he confirmed that he  had
    had no contact with them but  that  he  had  tried  to  contact  Social
    Services but they would not let him have any contact.   In  respect  of
    his ex-partner he said that he last spoke to her a year ago but had had
    no contact with her since.

50.   As to his own family, he confirmed  that  his  family  including  his
    siblings and parents resided in the United Kingdom.   He  confirmed  he
    had had no contact with his parents but had  had  some  recent  contact
    with his siblings.  He said that his sister had sent him a message last
    night and he had heard from his brother.  It was put to  him  that  his
    relationship with his family had broken down seven or eight years  ago,
    in fact if not longer ten years ago.  The Appellant stated that it  had
    been "rocky for probably fifteen years" and  sometimes  they  were  not
    speaking to him.  He stated that he had had contact  with  his  brother
    but had only started to have contact with his sister recently.  She had
    got married and he spoke to her.  He confirmed that since he  had  been
    released on bail he had not seen any of his relatives or  siblings  but
    that she had sent him a picture of her wedding.

51. There was no re-examination.  He was asked some questions by the panel.
     He confirmed that he had not undertaken the drugs course that had been
    recommended in the OASys report.  He claimed that it was because he was
    not a heavy class A drug user.  He said that he had tried  cocaine  but
    he was not a heavy  user  but  was  using  cannabis  every  day;  skunk
    cannabis.  He confirmed that in mitigation on his  behalf  his  Counsel
    had confirmed that he was addicted to  drugs.   When  asked  about  the
    weapon that he had in his house, he said that he had obtained it from a
    friend and that he had friends who had firearms.  He further  confirmed
    that the children were in the home when he had the  gun.   As  to  past
    intervention by the Probation Services, in  respect  of  the  community
    order that had been passed he was asked if he had done any courses.  He
    said that he did not undertake any courses at that  time  and  that  he
    would not have done any in any event because at that time he was  still
    taking drugs and trying to make money.

52. As to future plans, he  confirmed  that  he  previously  said  that  he
    planned to be a promoter and that now his  plans  for  the  future  had
    changed.  He said that his cousin was a promoter  and  that  there  was
    always trouble in nightclubs and he did not want to be involved in that
    kind of scene.  He confirmed in relation to his conviction history that
    he had used five aliases.  When asked why, he said it was "to get  away
    with stuff".

53. As to other plans for the future, he said that he  had  spoken  to  the
    probation officer and that he had not wished to reside  in  London  and
    that the Probation Service said that they could help him in Bolton.  He
    said he did not know anyone in Bolton.  When asked about  contact  with
    his friends in London, he said that he had spoken to one or two of them
    and when asked if those were friends who were  involved  in  crime  the
    Appellant said that he had a friend who had gone  to  prison  and  upon
    release had started a plumbing business.  He said friends that  he  had
    known for a long period of time that some of them  were  criminals  but
    now he would say that he would not become  involved  with  them.   When
    asked if he had received help in prison for drugs he said that  he  did
    not.  He was asked how old he was when he left school.  He said that he
    left at 16 and attended college only briefly but that did not last very
    long.

54. At the conclusion of our questions, we asked the parties  if  they  had
    any further questions.  Mr Wilding asked him about his comments that he
    was still in contact with friends and that some were involved in  crime
    and that that was inconsistent with his view to  having  motivation  to
    turn his life around and demonstrated  those  negative  ties  were  not
    severed.  The Appellant said that he  took  it  that  they  were  still
    involved but these were people that he had known for twenty  years  and
    they were his friends. Although they did not have time to meet up, they
    could talk on the phone.  He stated that just because  they  may  be  a
    criminal does not mean that he would meet them.  It was put to him that
    it did not demonstrate that he was so committed  that  he  would  sever
    ties with them.  He said that he had the strength and power to  say  to
    friends that he would not carry out criminal activities.  He said  that
    he would be lying if he said that he had no criminal friends; they  are
    friends he had known for twenty years but he said that he would not say
    he would not contact them but he would tell them that he would  not  be
    involved in any criminal activities.  They  may  still  keep  the  same
    relationship but it would not be the same as before.  In respect of the
    firearms he was asked about his evidence that he had  kept  it  in  the
    house where the children were living and was asked why he had  had  it.
    He said that he had it because of his lifestyle; that "you get  threats
    and you are not thinking right".  He said it was part of the  lifestyle
    for protection purposes.

55. Mr Bartram had no further questions.

The Submissions of the Parties:

56. We heard from Mr Wilding who relied upon the skeleton argument that  he
    had prepared.  In addition he made the following oral submissions.   He
    submitted that the effect of  MF  (Nigeria)  in  conjunction  with  the
    decision of SS (Nigeria) demonstrated that where someone did  not  meet
    the Immigration Rules then very great weight needed to be given to  the
    public interest in  considering  whether  "exceptionally"  they  should
    succeed on the basis that they could  not  meet  the  criteria  of  the
    Rules.  In this case as a result of the offences committed he  received
    a sentence of four years' imprisonment and it must  be  an  exceptional
    case before the public interest is outweighed.  He submitted  that  the
    central issue in this case was the private life established and whether
    that private life outweighed the  public  interest.   He  reminded  the
    Tribunal that the First-tier Tribunal panel's findings were that  there
    was no family  life  engaged  in  his  case  and  those  findings  were
    preserved by the Upper Tribunal.  Even at the date of the hearing there
    was no evidence to any family life  being  established  in  the  United
    Kingdom for Article 8 purposes  and  there  was  crucially  a  lack  of
    evidence and in those circumstances the only relevant consideration was
    the Appellant's private life based on his length  of  residence,  given
    the lack of evidence concerning the constituent elements of his private
    life.

57. Mr Wilding referred us to the decision of Balogun.  He  submitted  that
    the facts of the appeal were very similar to  the  present  appeal  and
    that in Balogun  he too was an Appellant who  the  court  accepted  had
    arrived at the age of 3 in the United Kingdom.  It was a case where  he
    had had difficulties in his childhood and as a  teenager  and  the  key
    offences committed related to possession with intent to supply class  A
    drugs and he was sentenced to a period of three years.  In  respect  of
    that case the important feature was the length  of  his  residence  and
    also that he had had a relationship with a British citizen.   Thus  the
    circumstances are very similar in terms of length of residence  but  in
    his case the offences took place  when  he  was  a  juvenile.   In  the
    present appeal the Appellant was an adult when the index offences  were
    committed.  The court in Balogun submitted that there would be required
    "very strong reasons" to justify the deportation of a settled  migrant,
    however on the facts of Balogun notwithstanding that,  they  considered
    it was not  disproportionate  for  his  deportation  even  taking  into
    account his length of residence and lack of ties in Nigeria.  As  Judge
    Gaetano  stated  at  paragraph  3  "Article  8  provides  no   absolute
    protection against expulsion of a category of  aliens  including  those
    born in the host country".  Thus he submitted the   Appellant's  length
    of residence did not demonstrate that he should not be deported.

58. He further submitted in reference to the Rules that the  Appellant  was
    sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years and  was  therefore
    not able to rely on the length  of  residence  set  out  in  the  Rules
    themselves to avoid deportation.

59. We were then referred to MF Nigeria and in particular paragraphs 42  to
    44.  In this context he reminded the Tribunal that the decision made it
    clear that when approaching the  question  of  whether  removal  was  a
    proportionate interference with an individual's Article 8 rights,  that
    the "scales are heavily weighted in favour of deportation and something
    very compelling (which  will  all  be  'exceptional')  is  required  to
    outweigh the public interest in removal".  As  the  court  went  on  to
    state "It is no coincidence that the phrase 'exceptional circumstances'
    is used in the new Rules in  the  context  of  weighing  the  competing
    factors  for  and  against  deportation  of  foreign  criminals".    At
    paragraph 43 it was stated:

         "The word 'exceptional' is often used to denote a departure from  a
         general Rule.  The general Rule in the present context is that,  in
         the case of a foreign prisoner to whom paragraphs 399 and  399A  do
         not apply, very compelling reasons will be required to outweigh the
         public interest in deportation.  These compelling reasons  are  the
         'exceptional circumstances'."

    Thus, he submitted, the new Rules are a  complete  code  and  that  the
    exceptional  circumstances  are  to  be  considered  in  the  balancing
    exercise involved the application of a proportionality test as required
    by the Strasbourg jurisprudence (see paragraph 44).

60. Mr Wilding submitted that when looking at the Rules  at  paragraph  399
    and 399A, it is plain  that  length  of  residence  is  not  enough  by
    contrasting the circumstances  of  those  who  receive  a  sentence  of
    imprisonment of two years that if they can show that they have lived in
    the UK for over twenty years and no ties with the  country  of  removal
    then under the Rules it would be disproportionate to remove them and in
    those  circumstances  their  appeal  would  be  allowed.   However  the
    situation is different for those sentenced to a period of  imprisonment
    for over four years and in those cases they would  have  to  show  that
    there were "very compelling reasons".  Therefore this Appellant, having
    received  a  sentence  of  six  years'  imprisonment  would   have   to
    demonstrate "very compelling reasons" which would be far  greater  than
    the length of residence and the issue of ties in Cameroon.

61. In this appeal he submitted that there should be great weight  attached
    to the public interest in deportation of the Appellant  because  it  is
    not now simply the policy of the Secretary of State but a  judgment  of
    Parliament and as recognised by Laws L J in he decision of Richards (as
    cited) that gives it special weight which the courts should  recognise.
    Mr Wilding contrasted the comparable legislation in  Austria  when  the
    European Court considered the decision in Maslov.  The Austrian  Aliens
    Act 1997 states explicitly "An exclusion order can be issued", no  such
    discretion applies to automatic deportation; and deportation order must
    be made unless to do so would breach the person's Convention rights.

62. Therefore drawing all those factors together, the length  of  residence
    is not  sufficient.   The  Appellant  had  not  advanced  any  specific
    elements of private life other than his length of residence and  it  is
    not a case where there are any relevant children or  family  life  that
    has been established which needs to be put  in  the  balance.   On  the
    other side of the balance  there  is  a  significant  criminal  history
    culminating in a  significant  term  of  imprisonment  leading  to  the
    decision to deport.  As the exceptions  to  automatic  deportation  are
    codified in the Immigration Rules they  do  not  assist  the  Appellant
    because his sentence was one of over four years.  Thus the Secretary of
    State submitted that deportation was proportionate when everything  was
    considered by looking at the  circumstances  of  the  offence  and  the
    sentence imposed.

63.   The circumstances demonstrated that he was keeping, and continues  to
    keep albeit more remotely, to be in the company of those who  committed
    criminal offences around drug dealing.  There is no confidence  in  the
    assertion that he is a changed man and given  his  record,  great  care
    should be taken before accepting his strength of resolve or  commitment
    to change.  Even if it was accepted, it would have  little  bearing  on
    the balancing exercise of proportionality.

64.   As to the submission made on behalf of the Appellant in the  skeleton
    argument relying on the decision of BK (Deportation) as cited, and  the
    concept of a "home grown criminal" that case  is  distinguishable  from
    the current jurisprudence in  that  it  was  a  pre-2007  Act  and  the
    legislative  background  has  changed.    The   decision   in   Balogun
    demonstrates that someone who might have been  in  the  position  of  a
    "home grown criminal" based on his length of  residence  of  a  similar
    type that this Appellant has, was found not to be disproportionate  and
    that it has not been shown that the  very  strong  public  interest  in
    deportation has been outweighed and that the length  of  residence  was
    not a compelling circumstance.

65. We were then addressed by Mr Bartram on behalf of  the  Appellant.   He
    also relied upon his skeleton argument that he produced before us.   He
    began by referring us to Maslov and in particular paragraph 76 of  that
    decision.  He submitted that it was very clear that the European  Court
    had reiterated that the state had a margin of appreciation as  to  what
    was proportionate and it had not been the Appellant's case that Article
    8 was always a shield nor was it his case that the imperative to deport
    foreign nationals should not be given significant weight.  That  was  a
    matter referred to in Maslov and was one criteria to put in the balance
    as was the nature  and  seriousness  of  the  offences  committed.   He
    therefore submitted that all the factors are  important  including  the
    public interest which is a  legitimate  aim  of  deportation.   He  too
    agreed with the submission of  Mr  Wilding  as  to  the  effect  of  MF
    (Nigeria) and that the new Rules set out a position where an  Appellant
    can succeed and that the  reasons  should  be  sufficiently  compelling
    noting a departure from the general Rule.

66. He further referred us to paragraphs 68 to 75 of Maslov submitting that
    that had been a thorough consideration of the Article 8 principles  and
    that in that case that where there  is  long  residence  of  a  settled
    migrant, the relevant criteria was identified as  being  "very  serious
    reasons" which he submitted reflecting the "compelling reasons" set out
    in MF (Nigeria) and that this could outweigh the public  interest.   He
    therefore submitted that the public interest  could  be  outweighed  by
    something  outside  of  the  ordinary.    In  those  circumstances   he
    submitted that the decision of BK had not been superseded  in  the  way
    advanced by the Secretary of State.  That was a case that looked at the
    issue of deportation.  He submitted that the issue of  deportation  was
    to keep faith in the system.  He referred us to paragraph 14 of BK  and
    that the line of reasoning set out  there  goes  to  the  core  of  the
    automatic deportation provisions, namely that it must  be  based  on  a
    purposeful view.  There must always be other factors that would  render
    deportation a disproportionate measure.  The purpose of the deportation
    Rules is to deter foreign criminals and to express the public revulsion
    and reflect the views of the public; but when looking at the purpose of
    them, there are a set of circumstances like the present ones, where  an
    individual has lived in the UK for a significant period  of  time  that
    would therefore show that  such  a  measure  when  applied  to  him  is
    disproportionate.

67. Whilst the decision of Balogun has been relied upon by the Secretary of
    State and the facts are similar, it was a relevant  consideration  that
    there was no mention of the risk  of  re-offending  and  that  case  or
    remorse, or rehabilitation as there has been  in  the  present  appeal.
    Furthermore their leave was tenuous but was physically present  and  in
    this case he has  lived  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  lawful  leave.
    Therefore having considered all of those factors in Maslov, in  essence
    all the facts must be considered on its own merits to conclude  whether
    deportation is proportionate to the legitimate aim.  When applying  the
    test of either "very serious  reasons"  or  "compelling  circumstances"
    they are demonstrated in this case by his length of residence since the
    age of 3.  He has little or no cultural awareness of the  circumstances
    in Cameroon and only has connections with the UK.  There is  sufficient
    information in the report to show that  the  risk  of  re-offending  is
    lower (in the light of the report from the course undertaken  in  2011)
    and that the Appellant has shown good understanding  and insight to his
    previous lifestyle.  In those circumstances it ranks as an  exceptional
    case  or  in  the  alternative  that  there  are   compelling   reasons
    demonstrated to show why deportation is disproportionate.   He  invited
    us to allow the appeal.

68. At the conclusion of the appeal we reserved our determination.

Findings of fact and analysis:

69. We found no error of law in the Tribunal's findings as to  family  life
    and the best interests of the children and that the  only  error  found
    was in regard to the absence of other material  considerations  in  the
    balancing exercise.  In those circumstances we preserved  the  findings
    of the First-tier Tribunal which were, in essence, that  the  Appellant
    did not enjoy any family life but was a single adult and was  not  part
    of a family unit.

70.   The findings of the Tribunal and the evidence upon  which  they  were
    based can be summarised as follows:

      i) The Appellant is the father of two children; WT (his  stepson)  and
         NT (his biological daughter born in 2005).  The  children's  mother
         is LT and whilst they were in a previous relationship they had  not
         lived together permanently (OASys report [68  FTT  decision]).   In
         2007 he received a police caution for assault on LT as a result  of
         a row that had got out of hand.

     ii) The  children's  mother  had  been  asked  to  provide  information
         concerning his relationship with the children in 2011.  She  failed
         to respond.   The  panel  concluded  this  may  have  been  due  to
         incarceration of  having  suffered  mental  health  problems.   The
         children had been placed into care of the Social Services (at  [67]
         FTT decision).

    iii) He last saw his daughter before he  went  to  prison  in  September
         2008.

     iv) He stated before  the  Tribunal  that  he  wished  to  re-establish
         contact with his daughter.

71. His evidence before this Tribunal was that he had last had contact with
    his partner a year ago by telephone and had not  spoken  to  her  since
    that time.  He confirmed that he had had no contact with  his  daughter
    and whilst he wished to re-establish it with her he had not done so.

72. We  acknowledge,  as  did  the  First-tier  Tribunal  panel,  that  the
    Appellant is the father of  NT  and  that  he  wishes  to  re-establish
    contact with his daughter.  However the circumstances are such that  he
    has not had contact with her now since 2008 and we further  acknowledge
    that whilst it would be in their best interests to  have  contact  with
    their non-residential parent, given the length of  separation  and  the
    lack of evidence concerning the nature of the relationship between  the
    Appellant and his children we cannot conclude that beyond  the  general
    principle, any weight can be given to that in the balancing exercise as
    noted by the First-tier Tribunal.

73. As to members of his family, the Appellant's parents and  siblings  are
    resident in the UK but as noted by the First-tier  Tribunal  they  have
    little or no contact with the Appellant.  The panel recorded  that  his
    parents had not visited him in prison (see [32] FTT decision) and  that
    was confirmed in  his  oral  evidence.   Further,  in  respect  of  his
    siblings, they have not visited him in prison and at the  time  of  the
    panel decision he had fallen  out  with  his  brother  Marvin.   As  to
    contact with them now, we find that  there  has  been  limited  contact
    between the Appellant and  his  siblings  and  had  only  recently  had
    contact with his sister by way of telephone.  He told us  that  despite
    his release he had not seen his siblings.

74.   None of the  family  members  gave  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal nor have they done so before this Tribunal.  Thus the evidence
    before us is no different to that  as  it  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal panel and thus all those preserved findings remain.

75.   The second issue relates  to  the  risk  of  re-offending.   In  this
    respect we have considered the  OASys  report  alongside  the  evidence
    before us.  The Probation Service are required to determine the  degree
    of risk of causing serious harm to the public and the likelihood of the
    offender re-offending within the two year  period  of  discharge.   The
    standard tool to deduce these  estimates  is  the  Offender  Assessment
    System (OASys)  which  combines  static,  actuarial  data  with  scores
    relating  to  the  prisoner's  achievements  in   addressing   dynamic,
    criminogenic factors such as anger, addictions, victim awareness and so
    on.  The document would be used initially to identify the key areas  of
    concern and convert them into a timed programme of action  known  as  a
    "sentence plan" and this  would  be  revised  in  order  to  chart  the
    prisoner's progress through his sentence.

76. It is also appropriate to observe  that  behaviour  in  prison,  family
    structure, employment prospects, and maturity on matters that can  also
    indicate future risk of re-offending and thus the risk of harm  to  the
    public.

77. We have therefore considered the OASys  report  in  the  light  of  the
    evidence before us.  We note that no party has sought to produce either
    before the First-tier Tribunal or before this panel an up-to-date OASys
    report or any further evidence from a probation  officer  and  the  one
    before us is dated 14th November 2011.  In that OASys report, the  risk
    of serious harm to the public was stated to be high as was the risk  of
    reconviction.  The areas identified which were a cause  of  concern  in
    the context  of  harm  are  the  analysis  of  the  offence,  financial
    management and  income,  lifestyle  and  associates,  drug  misuse  and
    attitudes.  The information relating to those areas is set out  in  the
    report.  The analysis of his offences has been  set  out  earlier.   In
    this context the Appellant describes himself as having been a drug user
    and a drug dealer who has  had  a  gun  for  his  protection,  who  has
    previous convictions for possession of drugs  and  also  possession  of
    weapons in a public place.

78. As to financial management, it was noted on the Appellant's own account
    that he had been a drug dealer prior to custody and that he may  return
    to this on release.  He also stated that he hoped to  have  moved  away
    from the idea by the time of his release.  The  financial  issues  were
    related to the risk of serious harm and offending  behaviour;  a  legal
    activity as the  source  of  income  was  recorded  as  a  "significant
    problem".  As to lifestyle and associates,  he  stated  that  he  would
    return to his previous lifestyle if released now but may be not in  the
    future.  He described himself as a "strong person making  a  decision".
    He stated he had taken drugs from people,  not  returning  to  pay  for
    them.  Continuing with his gang and drug related activities showed risk
    taking  behaviour.   He  agreed  with  this  stating,  if  he  had  the
    opportunity to think before reacting it minimised the risks.

79. His own drug misuse is described as;  that he had used drugs  but  that
    they were "not an issue".  He said "but will  probably  continue  after
    release".  He stated in interview that he was a drug dealer when not in
    custody and may return to it after release.

80. The section attitudes is set out at section 12; it reads as follows:

         "Mr Tabi  has  stated  that  he  may  continue  with  his  criminal
         activities on release.  It went on to state that he will do what he
         has to do in order to survive.  Even if it means letting off a  few
         caps (bullets).  He said  he  would  be  a  model  licensee...   He
         offended for financial reasons and  that  he  is  part  of  a  gang
         culture.  Something he aspired to as a young person because choices
         were limited and that he knew he needed to survive".

    The summary of risk is set out at R10 and identifies who  is  at  risk,
    namely "potential victims or society as a whole" and the nature of  the
    risk of harm  is  from  "drugs  offences  and  potential  discharge  of
    firearms."  The  risk  was  likely  to  be  greater  when  released  by
    returning to his previous lifestyle.  The factors linking to  producing
    risk were said to be those relevant to his employment and his  wish  to
    start a promotion business with friends.  The risk to  the  public  was
    said to be high which was defined as "there are identifiable indicators
    of risk of serious harm.  The potential even could happen at  any  time
    and the impact would be serious."  The risk of  reconviction  was  also
    said to be high (see page 22 of OASys).

81. The risk management plan looking at  his  motivation  and  capacity  to
    change and the particular facts of the offences indicated that  he  was
    "quite capable of change in this area" and work  required  to  increase
    motivation was drug related work and motivational work including  CARAT
    for one year of offending work.

82. In this context we note the age of the OASys report  and  that  neither
    party has sought to produce any up-to-date evidence from the  Probation
    Services and in  those  circumstances  we  have  considered  the  other
    evidence before us relevant to this issue.

83.  It is plain that the Appellant has completed a TSP post  programme  on
    14th February 2011 (see Appellant's bundle for report).  The  programme
    was related to develop his thinking skills.  The areas are described as
    "stop   and   think",   "emotional   awareness",   "problem   solving",
    "perspective taking", "offence free relationships", "goals and  values"
    and "seeing the whole picture".  In summary, the report indicated  that
    he had made significant progress and that he had displayed openness and
    was a very supportive member of the group.  As the First-tier  Tribunal
    noted  at  paragraph  92  of  their  decision,  he  had  shown  a  good
    understanding of the impact of emotions on his behaviour and recognised
    anger, boredom, embarrassment and frustration as  problematic  emotions
    for him. We concur with the First-tier Tribunal that the report overall
    is indeed encouraging.  In addition  to  that  course  he  undertook  a
    Restore course between 5th and 15th September 2011 dealing with  victim
    awareness and restorative justice.  There is no report for that course.
     He has also produced certificates having completed units  in  personal
    and social development on behalf of the National Open College  Network.
    They show having attained 18 credits for  different  modules  including
    cash flow forecasting, creating  visions  for  business  and  financial
    needs, computer skills, database software and IT user skills.

84. In relation  to  his  behaviour  and  conduct  in  prison,  there  were
    adjudications in 2010 where he was found in possession  of  an  insulin
    pen, 112.5 grams of tobacco and several items not on his property  card
    and therefore unauthorised and also found in possession of a radio.  As
    the First-tier Tribunal panel  noted,  none  of  those  would  seem  to
    indicate any antisocial features.

85. In that context we make  the  following  observations.   We  take  into
    account the fact that there has not been an updated  OASys  report  and
    that neither party sought to produce any  further  evidence  concerning
    the assessment of risk of harm or re-offending that  is  more  current.
    There is no information either from his current  probation  officer  or
    from the service.  Whilst we have seen  a  reference  letter  from  the
    detention support project manager who makes reference  to  his  current
    motivation, she has not appeared before us as a witness nor do we  find
    that she qualified in the assessment of risk.

86. In the context of the OASys report there are areas of concern including
    drugs, attitude and lifestyles  are  highlighted.   The  Appellant  has
    participated in a post programme report of 2011  which  is  a  thinking
    skills programme.  We note the comments and the encouraging  nature  of
    that report.  However the thinking  skills  course,  whilst  we  accept
    covered some work on current attitudes, did not deal with the issue  of
    drug awareness.  The Probation Service recommended he  undertook  CARAT
    which we understand concerns the issue of  misuse  of  drugs.   If  the
    First-tier Tribunal panel noted he had not  undertaken  such  a  course
    which  was  identified  as  one  necessary  to  reduce  the   risk   of
    reconviction and therefore the risk of harm to  the  public  which  was
    said to be high.  He confirmed before us that he had not undertaken any
    work around the misuse of drugs.

87. We cannot make our own risk assessment but  note  that  whilst  he  has
    attended some work prior to release other work identified has not  been
    carried out.  We are concerned that at the time of the offence and  his
    offending history in general they arose out of gang culture  and  those
    that he was associating with.  We take into account his  evidence  that
    this was not a gang in the sense of a "named gang" but nonetheless they
    were a group  who  on  his  own  evidence,  had  a  common  purpose  to
    collectively commit crime for financial gain.  That  was,  he  told  us
    openly, his only source of income for a considerable  period  of  time.
    It is of concern that he  continues  to  keep  in  contact  with  those
    friendships as he told us they go back a number of years.  It is  plain
    that  from  his  own  evidence  he  committed  offences  for  financial
    motivation and on the present evidence  it  does  not  demonstrate  any
    prospects of employment.  The evidence concerning his future plans  has
    been conflicting.  Whilst he has told  us  that  he  is  committed  and
    motivated to change and whilst we accept the evidence set  out  in  the
    thinking skills programme which  shows  some  signs  of  encouragement,
    given his previous offending history, lifestyle and associates we  must
    give great caution before  accepting  his  strength  of  resolve  which
    before us is untested  and  uncorroborated.   Consequently  whilst  the
    OASys report is of some age and there is  no  recent  assessment,  even
    with the recent completion of the course, we consider the risk  of  re-
    offending has not been demonstrated to have reduced significantly.   In
    any event even if the risk of re-offending has  reduced,  an  important
    facet of the public interest identified from the  jurisprudence  before
    us concerns not  only  the  risk  of  re-offending  but  the  issue  of
    deterrence.

The Law:

88. We commence by setting out the relevant provisions of  the  Immigration
    Rules relating to deportation and  Article  8,  as  introduced  by  the
    Statement of Changes in HC 194 on 9th July 2012, at paragraphs  396  to
    399B:
         "396.    Where a person is liable to  deportation  the  presumption
                shall be that the public interest requires deportation.   It
                is in the public interest to deport where the  Secretary  of
                State must make  a  deportation  order  in  accordance  with
                Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007.
         397. A deportation order will not be made if the  person's  removal
                pursuant  to  the  order  would  be  contrary  to  the  UK's
                obligations under the Refugee Convention or the Human Rights
                Convention.  Where deportation  would  not  be  contrary  to
                these  obligations,  it  will   only   be   in   exceptional
                circumstances that the public  interest  in  deportation  is
                outweighed.

         Deportation and Article 8

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
                to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human  Rights
                Convention, and
                (a)     the  deportation  of  the  person  from  the  UK  is
                    conducive to the public  good  because  they  have  been
                    convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
                    sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  at  least  4
                    years;
                (b)     the  deportation  of  the  person  from  the  UK  is
                    conducive to the public  good  because  they  have  been
                    convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
                    sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  less  than  4
                    years but at least 12 months; or
                (c)     the  deportation  of  the  person  from  the  UK  is
                    conducive to the public good because, in the view of the
                    Secretary of State, their offending has  caused  serious
                    harm or they are  a  persistent  offender  who  shows  a
                    particular disregard for the law,
                the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider
                whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it  does  not,
                it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public
                interest in deportation will be outweighed by other factors.
         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
                if -
                (a)    the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                    relationship with a child under the age of 18 years  who
                    is in the UK, and
                    (i)    the child is a British Citizen; or
                    (ii)   the child has lived in the UK continuously for at
                        least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of
                        the immigration decision; and in either case
                        (a)    it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  the
                             child to leave the UK; and
                        (b)    there is no other family member who is  able
                             to care for the child in the UK; or
                (b)    the person has a genuine and subsisting  relationship
                    with a partner who  is  in  the  UK  and  is  a  British
                    Citizen, settled in the UK, or in the  UK  with  refugee
                    leave or humanitarian protection, and
                    (i)    the person has lived in the UK with  valid  leave
                        continuously for at least the 15 years  immediately
                        preceding the  date  of  the  immigration  decision
                        (discounting any period of imprisonment); and
                    (ii)   there are insurmountable obstacles to family life
                        with that partner continuing outside the UK.
         399A.    This paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
                applies if -
                (a)    the person has lived continuously in the  UK  for  at
                    least 20 years immediately preceding  the  date  of  the
                    immigration  decision   (discounting   any   period   of
                    imprisonment) and he  has  no  ties  (including  social,
                    cultural or family) with the country to which  he  would
                    have to go if required to leave the UK; or
                (b)    the person is aged under 25 years, he  has  spent  at
                    least half of his life living  continuously  in  the  UK
                    immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the   immigration
                    decision (discounting any period of imprisonment) and he
                    has no ties (including social, cultural or family)  with
                    the country to which he would have to go if required  to
                    leave the UK.
         399B.    Where paragraph 399 or 399A applies limited leave  may  be
                granted for periods not  exceeding  30  months.  Such  leave
                shall be given subject to such conditions as  the  Secretary
                of  State  deems  appropriate.  Where  a  person   who   has
                previously been granted a period of  leave  under  paragraph
                399B would not fall for  refusal  under  paragraph  322(1C),
                indefinite leave to remain may be granted."

89. The first step under the new Rules is  to  decide  whether  deportation
    would be contrary to an individual's Article 8 rights on the grounds as
    to whether the case falls  within  paragraph  399  or  399A.   In  this
    appeal, paragraphs 399 and 399A do not apply  because  the  case  falls
    within paragraph 398(a) due to the length of the sentence being one  in
    excess of four years.  The length of  sentence  in  this  case  is  six
    years.

90. The new Rules provide that in the event that paragraphs 399 and 399A do
    not apply "it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public
    interest in deportation would be outweighed by other factors" thus  the
    Appellant can only succeed if he can  show  "exceptional  circumstances
    that the public interest in deportation will  be  outweighed  by  other
    factors".

91. It is common ground before us that in accordance with the  decision  of
    MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the test  is  in  effect  the
    proportionality assessment in compliance with the Strasbourg  authority
    and whilst there  is  no  test  of  exceptionality,  the  Appellant  is
    required to show "very  compelling  reasons"  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deportation.

92. Ultimately in this appeal, the Appellant's case is based on the private
    life established by his length of residence (there being no family life
    established) and whether that is a compelling reason  to  outweigh  the
    public interest.

93. In this context we find it necessary to set out the nature  and  weight
    of the public interest in deportation appeals.

94. The weight to be given to the public interest has always  been  greater
    in a deportation case than that  involving  removal  (see  JO  (Uganda)
    [2010] EWCA Civ 10 at paragraph 29).  In the light of  the  legislative
    provisions set out earlier made under the provisions of Section  32  of
    the UK Borders Act 2007, there is no requirement for the Home Secretary
    to form her own view of the public interest in  the  deportation  of  a
    foreign criminal who is  sentenced  to  not  less  than  twelve  months
    because by statute deportation of foreign criminals  is  deemed  to  be
    conducive to the public good.  As Sir Stephen Sedley said at  paragraph
    9 of Gurung v  SSHD  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  62  (when  commenting  upon  RU
    (Bangladesh)):

         "In the absence of statutory exception, the Tribunal must uphold  a
         deportation order against a foreign criminal not because  the  Home
         Secretary considers that the public interest  requires  deportation
         but because Parliament does ..."

95. It has since been observed by Lord Justice  Laws  at  paragraph  21  of
    Richards v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 244 that:

         "21. What in my judgment needs emphasis is that the  strong  public
             interest in deporting foreign criminals is now not merely  the
             policy  of  the  Secretary  of  State  but  the  judgment   of
             Parliament.  That gives it special weight,  which  the  courts
             ought to recognise, as no doubt  the  Strasbourg  Court  will.
             This approach sits  with  the  well  established  approach  to
             proportionality questions in European Union law where Acts  of
             the primary legislator enjoy a wide margin of discretion  (see
             R v The Secretary of State for Health ex-parte Eastside Cheese
             [1999] 3 CMLR 123 per Lord Bingham,  especially  at  paragraph
             48)."

96. The importance of this was  further  underlined  by  Laws  L  J  in  SS
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550 at paragraph 10:

         "[T]here  is  no  acknowledgement  in  Sanade  (nor,  I  think.  In
         Strasbourg) at the weight to be attached in an Article 8 case which
         states policy of deporting foreign criminals may be  greater  where
         the policy is made, not by the executive  government,  but  by  the
         legislature.  But this seems to me to be of very great  importance.
         I shall explain the position as I see it below."

    Reminding  decision  makers  of  the  status  of  varying   margin   of
    proportionality, Laws LJ states:

         "The importance of these considerations of  proportionality  is  as
         follows.  The principle of  minimal  interference  means  that  the
         fundamental right in question in the case can never,  lawfully,  be
         treated as a token or a ritual.  But the  margin  of  discretionary
         judgment enjoyed by the primary decision  maker,  though  variable,
         means that the court's role is kept in balance  with  that  of  the
         elected arms of government; and refers to quiet and  constitutional
         anxieties that the Human Rights Act draw  the  judges  onto  ground
         that they should not occupy.  These points matter especially  where
         the area in question is controversial, as to  the  edge  between  a
         child's rights  and  the  deportation  of  a  foreign  criminal  at
         paragraph 42."

    Laws LJ went on to summarise the key factors  in  proportionality  that
    decision makers were reminded of at paragraph 47.  He then went  on  to
    note the "insufficient attention" which had been given to this.  Indeed
    he stated:

         "48. In Sanade the UT observed  '[T]he  more  seriously  offending,
             stronger is the case for deportation'  (paragraph  48).   With
             respect that is no doubt right; but it applies as readily to a
             case  where  the  offender  is  not   subject   to   automatic
             deportation under Section 32 of the 2007 Act and  his  removal
             is at the Secretary of  State's  discretion.   In  Strasbourg,
             within the Uner-Maslov criteria  we  must  find  a  comparable
             reference to the  'nature  and  seriousness'  of  the  offence
             committed by the applicant'.

         49.  These references say nothing about  the  policy's  origin  and
             primary legislation.  The policy source,  however,  is  as  we
             have seen one of the drivers of the breadth  of  the  decision
             maker's margin of discretion when the proportionality  of  its
             application in a particular case is being considered."

97. Laws L J endorses Sedley L J in NK noting  that  "Sedley  LJ  was  with
    respect right to state that "[in the case of a 'foreign  criminal'  the
    Act places in the proportionality scales a  remarkedly  greater  weight
    than in other cases" (paragraph  53)  and  noting  that  "the  pressing
    nature of the public interest here is vividly informed by the fact that
    by Parliament's express declaration the public interest is  injured  if
    the criminal's deportation is not affected.  Such a result could in  my
    judgment only be justified by a very strong claim indeed".   (Paragraph
    54).

98. Thus we find that from the authorities in conjunction with that  of  MF
    (Nigeria) which we have cited previously, provides us  with  assistance
    in determining what are  the  "very  compelling  reasons"  required  to
    outweigh the public interest and the very great weight attached to  the
    public interest.   The  stronger  factors  in  support  of  the  public
    interest show the stronger needs to be the countervailing factors  said
    to be compelling factors making deportation disproportionate.

99. The three facets of the public interest which have to be considered  in
    a deportation case were summarised by Wilson L J (as he  then  was)  at
    paragraph 13 of OH Serbia v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 694:

         "(a) The risk of re-offending by the person concerned;

         (b)  the need to deter foreign nationals  from  committing  serious
             offences by leading them to understand that whatever the other
             circumstances, one certain consequence of  that  may  well  be
             deportation; and

         (c)   the  role  of  deportation  as  an  expression  of  society's
             revulsion at serious crimes and in building public  confidence
             in the  treatment  of  foreign  citizens  who  have  committed
             serious offences."

100. Those three facets are  equally  applicable  in  automatic  deportation
    cases such as the present (see RU (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 6
    and AM v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1634).  In SS  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD  [2013]
    EWCA Civ  550,  the  Court  of  Appeal  emphasised  that  in  automatic
    deportation appeals, the 2007 Act set a  legislative  policy  that  the
    deportation of a "foreign criminal" such as the applicant  was  in  the
    "public interest".  Laws LJ at [54] concluded:

         "The pressing  nature  of  the  public  interest  here  is  vividly
         informed by the fact that by Parliament's express  declaration  the
         public interest is injured if the  criminal's  deportation  is  not
         affected.  Such a result could in my judgment only be justified  by
         a very strong claim indeed."

101. With those matters in mind we set out the  factors  recognised  in  the
    settled jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court to be taken into  account
    when making an assessment of the  proportionality  of  an  individual's
    deportation.   The  "Boultif  criteria"  (as  they   are   known)   are
    conveniently set out in the  Grand  Chamber  decision  in  Uner  v  The
    Netherlands (Application number 46410/99) [2007] Imm AR 303 at [57] and
    [58] as follows:
        [57] Even if Article 8 of the Convention does not therefore contain
        an absolute right for any category of alien not to be expelled, the
        Court's case law amply demonstrates that there  are  circumstances
        where the expulsion of an alien will give rise to  a  violation  of
        that provision (see, for example, the judgments  in  Moustaquim  v.
        Belgium, Beldjoudi v. France  and  Boultif  v.  Switzerland,  cited
        above; see also Amrollahi v. Denmark, no. 56811/00, 11 July  2002;
        Y?lmaz v. Germany, no.  52853/99,  17  April  2003;  and  Keles  v.
        Germany, 32231/02, 27 October 2005). In the  case  of  Boultif  the
        Court elaborated the relevant criteria which it would use in  order
        to  assess  whether  an  expulsion  measure  was  necessary  in   a
        democratic society and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
        These criteria, as  reproduced  in  paragraph  40  of  the  Chamber
        judgment in the present case, are the following:
        -  the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the
        applicant;
        -  the length of the applicant's stay in the country from which he
      or she is to be expelled;
         -  the time elapsed since the offence was committed and the
         applicant's conduct during that period;
        -  the nationalities of the various persons concerned;
        -  the applicant's family situation, such as the length of the
        marriage, and other factors expressing the effectiveness of a
        couple's family life;
        -  whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when he or
        she entered into a family relationship;
        -  whether there are children of the marriage, and if so, their age;
      and
        -  the seriousness of the difficulties which the spouse is likely to
        encounter in the country to which the applicant is to be expelled.
      [58] The Court would wish to make explicit two criteria which may
      already be implicit in those identified in the Boultif judgment:
      -  the best interests and well-being of the children, in particular
      the seriousness of the difficulties which any children of the
      applicant are likely to encounter in the country to which the
      applicant is to be expelled; and
        -  the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the host
      country and with the country of destination.



102.  The  Appellant's  case  rests  upon  the  sole  ground  that  he   has
    established a private life in  the  UK  by  virtue  of  the  length  of
    residence; there being no establishment of family life (that  is  as  a
    partner or children) relied upon.  We  have  therefore  considered  the
    length of that residence.  The Appellant arrived in the United  Kingdom
    on 1st December 1986 when aged 3 in the  company  of  his  brother  and
    parents.  He was granted indefinite leave to remain in 1991.   On  26th
    June 2000 he submitted an application for British nationality which was
    refused on 22nd January 2003.  The reason for refusing that application
    was as a result of his criminal convictions.  He  therefore  remains  a
    national of Cameroon.  Thus his past conduct of  offending  has  had  a
    bearing on his ability to be recognised as a British citizen.

103. We find a significant factor in his favour  is  the  length  of  lawful
    residence in the UK and that he had spent the majority of his life  and
    youth here having arrived at the age of  3  years.   Whilst  length  of
    residence is an important factor as we recognise, such residence can be
    outweighed where there is a strong public interest and in Maslov  "very
    serious reasons" are required for expulsion of a foreign  offender  who
    is lawfully resident in the UK.  In this context in considering whether
    or not "very serious" reasons exist in the Appellant's  case,  we  note
    the emphasis placed in Maslov a case where the offences were  committed
    as a juvenile.   This does not diminish  the  fact  that  such  serious
    reasons are required for expulsion in the case of adult offending.

104. In the Appellant's case his offending history commenced when he  was  a
    juvenile aged 17 but he has continued to offend  well  beyond  reaching
    his majority and was last convicted of an offence at  the  age  of  25.
    Contrary to the circumstances in Maslov,  this  is  not,  therefore,  a
    matter solely of juvenile delinquency.

105. First we consider that since the Appellant reaching his  majority,  the
    offences have escalated in their seriousness.

106. The Appellant has a number of criminal convictions which have been  set
    out earlier in this determination at paragraphs 5 to 10.  The  offences
    that triggered the deportation proceedings are set out at paragraph 11.



107. We reach the following conclusions concerning the  seriousness  of  the
    offences committed by the Appellant.  The Appellant  has  a  string  of
    convictions that  began  in  2001  when  aged  17.   Those  convictions
    involved offences of violence, dishonesty,  possession  of  weapons  in
    public, and offences involving drugs and a caution for assault  on  his
    partner.  The offences  which  triggered  the  deportation  proceedings
    related to convictions for three offences; possession of  a  prohibited
    weapon and possession of drugs (class A and class C).  This was not the
    first conviction for an offence involving a weapon but  his  third  and
    were his second  offences  involving  drugs.   In  March  2001  he  was
    convicted of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and on
    18th July 2008 was convicted of carrying an  air  weapon  in  a  public
    place.

108. We consider the seriousness  of  the  offences  are  reflected  in  the
    circumstances.  They indicate that a prohibited weapon was found when a
    police raid had taken place at the home and upon his own evidence where
    his partner and two children (who were  3  and  2  at  the  time)  were
    present in the house and a hand gun, namely a 8mm GAP BBM hand gun  was
    found in his safe along with quantities of class A and  class  C  drugs
    (cocaine and cannabis).  The barrel of the gun  had  been  drilled  and
    that he had obtained that gun from friends who had access to  firearms.
    He told us that he had had the gun for protection as he had been a drug
    dealer who needed the drugs for protection due to threats that  he  had
    sometimes received.

109. The information contained in the OASys report  describes  his  criminal
    lifestyle; he described himself as  a  drug  dealer  prior  to  custody
    having become involved in drugs at 14 years  old  being  introduced  to
    skunk cannabis and crack cocaine.  He described it  as  "being  out  of
    control for a couple of years and using drugs regularly".  In interview
    in June 2009 he stated that he had used cocaine a  couple  of  times  a
    month and using cannabis daily and could  be  violent  when  under  the
    influence.

110. The OASys report makes reference to the Appellant having been  involved
    in gang culture "something he aspired to  as  a  young  person  because
    choices were limited and he knew he needed to survive" (see 12.1  OASys
    report).

111. Whilst in his oral evidence he stated that he was not part of a  "named
    gang" but a group of friends  who  committed  criminal  activities,  we
    consider that it matters not whether it was a named gang, but that  his
    conduct demonstrates that he was involved in gang culture and that  his
    only source of income came from criminal  activity  and  dealings  with
    drugs, which he has candidly and openly admitted to us.

112. We consider  that  the  Appellant's  offending  as  recognised  by  the
    passing of a significant sentence of six years for the offences that he
    last committed, demonstrate an escalation in  the  seriousness  of  his
    offending.  The possession of a firearm in the  circumstances  set  out
    above and being in possession of class A and class  C  drugs  in  those
    circumstances posed a serious risk to the public not only in the  terms
    of drugs being traded on the streets but the risk  of  discharge  of  a
    firearm. We do however note that he was charged with possession of  the
    drugs and not intent to supply.

113. The Appellant's offences were of a most serious kind  and  we  consider
    the offences engage all three facets of the public interest, namely the
    need to deter other foreign nationals from committing similar offences,
    the importance  of  expressing  society's  revulsion  at  such  serious
    crimes.

114. We further note in Maslov that it did not involve a  case  where  there
    was an  equivalent  mandatory  nature  of  deportation  proceedings  as
    submitted by Mr Wilding.  The legislative  framework  set  out  is  the
    Australian Aliens Act 1997 states explicitly that  an  exclusion  order
    can be issued  and  no  such  discretion  applies  in  the  context  of
    automatic deportation; the deportation order must be made unless to  do
    so would breach a person's Convention rights.

115. We have been referred to the decision of the ECHR in Balogun  and  both
    advocates have sought to apply and distinguish that decision  in  their
    submissions before us. The case emphasises that very strong reasons are
    required to justify the deportation of settled  migrants.  This  was  a
    decision decided post-Maslov and the facts are similar to  the  present
    appeal. In Balogun the Appellant claimed to have entered  the UK at the
    age of 3 and the ECHR accepted his length of stay and  that  he  was  a
    settled migrant who had spent virtually the whole of his  childhood  in
    the host country(at [50]). As an adult (aged 20) he was convicted of  2
    drugs offences and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 3 years. He
    also had  previous  offences  for  drugs  and  dishonesty.  He  had  no
    established family life but it was accepted that he had  established  a
    private life and had been educated in the UK. There had been no  recent
    risk assessment but he had not committed any further offences since his
    release. The  appellant in Balogun had not been to  Nigeria  since  the
    age of 3 and had little or no ties to that country.

116. The court's assessment is  set  out  at  paragraph  [43].  Taking  into
    account the well established Strasbourg jurisprudence at [46], it  held
    that the Uner/Boultif criteria were relevant irrespective of the age of
    the person or length of residence citing  the  Grand  Chamber  at  [55]
    noting that

         " while a number of Contracting States have enacted legislation  or
         adopted policy rules to the effect that  long-term  immigrants  who
         were born in  those  States  or  who  arrived  there  during  early
         childhood  cannot be  expelled  on  the  basis  of  their  criminal
         record,... such an  absolute  right  not  to  be  expelled  cannot,
         however, be derived from Article 8 of the Convention,  couched,  as
         paragraph 2 of that provision is, in terms which clearly allow  for
         exceptions to be made to the general rights guaranteed in the first
         paragraph."

117. However, they noted at [46] that the age of a person is of  significant
    relevance in applying the  criteria,  when  assessing  the  nature  and
    seriousness of  the  offence  in  the  context  of  whether  they  were
    committed as a juvenile or as an adult and the age at when they entered
    the host country and whether they had spent a large part  or  even  all
    their childhood in that country. Again making reference  to  the  prior
    Strasbourg jurisprudence of "very special reasons."

118. Applying the criteria, the court found that the  offences  giving  rise
    to the proceedings were very serious, involving class  A  drugs  and  a
    sentence of 3 years and that the Secretary of  State  was  entitled  to
    take a grave view of offences involving drugs,  given  the  destructive
    effects on society as a whole.  It  was  noted  that  he  had  previous
    convictions and that save for some offences, they were committed as  an
    adult and therefore distinguished this case from that of  Maslov.  They
    took into account that he had not committed any further offences. As to
    length of stay, they accepted that he had been in the UK since the  age
    of 3 and treated him as a settled migrant who had spent  virtually  all
    his childhood in the UK  and  that  "very  serious  reasons"  would  be
    required to justify deportation. In respect of ties to his home country
    and the destination country, the main tie he may have, given the  young
    age he left the country and consequent lack  of  memories  or  cultural
    experience, was that his mother appeared to reside there. He was not in
    contact with here nor had any knowledge  of  her  whereabouts  and  not
    lived with her since arrival in the UK. They found that it was " not  a
    strong familial tie" but one that could be pursued if he chose  to.  As
    to ties in the UK, whilst his relatives where in the  UK  and  lawfully
    settled, his ties were characterised as limited as they were in Nigeria
    but his stronger ties were to the UK given his length of residence  and
    his  education  and  relationship  with  his  girlfriend.  Nonetheless,
    notwithstanding those ties to the UK, the specific circumstances of his
    upbringing, spending a far greater part of his childhood in the UK, his
    education in the UK and that his  ties  were  stronger  than  those  in
    Nigeria, the court stated " the fact remains that he is responsible for
    his own actions. Particularly  in  the  light  of  the  fact  that  the
    majority of his offences were committed when he  was  an  adult.."  (at
    [52]). They had no doubt that his deportation would have a very serious
    impact on his  private  life,  but  given  the  factors  in  his  case,
    deportation would not be disproportionate.

119. Mr Bartram conceded that the facts were similar but that there  was  no
    reference to risk of re-offending or remorse and rehabilitation  as  in
    this appeal and that in view of his lack of  ties  and  connections  to
    Cameroon along with his lengthy stay of residence as a lawfully settled
    migrant , in the  light  of  his  stated  motivation  they  constituted
    "exceptional circumstances" .

120. We find that the facts of Balogun  are  indeed  strikingly  similar  to
    those of the present appeal. We have made reference to those earlier in
    the determination. There are some distinguishing factors; the appellant
    in Balogun had a much more troubled upbringing than this Appellant , he
    also received a sentence of 3 years compared to 6 years in the  present
    case. The main tie to Nigeria was his mother who resided there but whom
    the appellant had no contact  with  and  therefore  was  not  a  strong
    familial tie; finding that his ties to the UK and Nigeria were  limited
    but that his ties to the  UK  were  stronger  than  those  to  Nigeria.
    Nonetheless they found that his deportation was proportionate  for  the
    reasons they gave at paragraphs [52] and [53]. Those reasons apply,  we
    find, to this Appellant.

Summary

121. On considering whether there are very serious reasons or whether  there
    are "exceptional  circumstances"  in  this  Appellant's  case  we  have
    reached the following conclusions.

122. The Appellant has been  convicted  of  a  serious  offence  meriting  a
    substantial period of imprisonment of six years.   Those  offences  are
    aggravated  by  the  Appellant's  admission  of  having  the  gun   for
    protection and it being due to his involvement as a drug dealer.  Those
    offences have to be seen in the context of his offending history  which
    commenced at the age of 17  but  continued  well  beyond  reaching  his
    majority and he was last convicted at the age of 25.  It is not  solely
    a matter of juvenile delinquency as we have noted.  We have found  that
    his offences have escalated in their seriousness.  He has been assessed
    as posing a high risk of harm to members of the public and the risk  of
    re-offending is also noted to be high; we recognise that  this  was  an
    assessment of risk made some time ago however for the reasons  set  out
    earlier  whilst  we  note  that  he  has  completed  a  course  towards
    minimising that risk and towards the aim of rehabilitation, and  whilst
    we commend the progress made on that course, we do not  find  that  the
    risk  has  diminished  significantly.   Whilst  we  accept  his  stated
    intention  to  stay  free   of   crime,   it   remains   untested   and
    uncorroborated.  We have voiced concerns earlier as  to  his  continued
    association with his criminal associates and his lack of plans for  the
    future.  In any event, when considering the weight to  be  attached  to
    the public interest the need for deterrence is  also  a  facet  of  the
    public  interest.   We  take  into  account  the   significant   weight
    attributed to the state's policy  of  deporting  foreign  criminals  as
    reflected in the primary legislation in the UK Borders  Act  2007  over
    and  above  the  public  interest  considerations  of  deterrence   and
    society's revulsion.

123. As regards his private life we accept that it a significant  factor  in
    his favour is the length of  residence  in  the  UK  having  spent  the
    majority of his life in the UK having arrived at the  age  of  3.   The
    First-tier Tribunal did not identify any features  of  the  Appellant's
    private life and  viewed  it  only  in  the  sense  of  his  length  of
    residence.  In this we accept that the Appellant has been  educated  in
    the UK and has grown up alongside the cultural life of the UK and grown
    up in the knowledge of the British way of life.  This is compared  with
    Cameroon with which he has little or no memory or experience.   However
    we note that it is not the case that he has never lived there;  he  has
    lived in Cameroon with his parents at a young age and returned  at  the
    age of 10 spending a year there with his parents  and  siblings  before
    returning to the UK.  Whilst his parents have been settled  in  the  UK
    they have spent most of their lives in Cameroon and we do not  consider
    that it can be said that he  has  no  cultural  knowledge  of  Cameroon
    having grown up with his parents.

124. In terms of his employment, he has had no long term  secure  employment
    relying on casual jobs and his own evidence is that his only source  of
    income has been from the illegitimate source from dealing in drugs  and
    committing crime as evidenced by  his  antecedent  history.   Thus  his
    private life has been characterised for a significant period of time by
    his criminal offending.

125. The offences have led to his application for British nationality  being
    refused in 2003 and therefore we consider that he must have  reasonably
    known  before  committing  the  index  offences  (which  triggered  the
    deportation proceedings) that this would be  a  relevant  consideration
    and had a bearing on his ability to be recognised as a British citizen.



126. There has been little positive in terms of his  private  life  advanced
    on behalf of the Appellant.   We  have  not  heard  any  evidence  from
    family, friends or  from  those  in  the  community  or  any  character
    references from those who know him.  As set out earlier, his  claim  is
    not based on any family life established in the light of  the  findings
    of the First-tier Tribunal.  Therefore this  case  differs  from  those
    most usually before the Tribunal in that there is no established family
    life relied upon with a partner or child and that his Article 8  rights
    are assessed in effect as a single adult who has lived independently.

127. We have therefore considered and weighed up all of those  factors  that
    we have identified and acknowledge the Strasbourg jurisprudence that it
    is required for their to be "very serious reasons" for the expulsion of
    a lawfully settled migrant who has spent a lengthy period of  residence
    in  the  host  country.   We  have  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    circumstances relied on are not "exceptional circumstances" within  the
    Immigration  Rules  and  that  deportation  is  justified  despite  the
    Appellant's lengthy residence here and the young age that he  left  his
    country of nationality and noting that his residence in the UK has been
    lawful.

128.   In reaching this conclusion we have recognised and taken  account  of
    all the evidence that his links to Cameroon are weak, although we  note
    that he has some knowledge of French and  that  he  has  some  cultural
    awareness of Cameroon as a result of his family background.  Conversely
    despite his length of residence in the UK, little of a positive  nature
    of private life has been advanced on his behalf.  We have found this  a
    difficult case to determine and one that has been finely  balanced  and
    we do not under estimate the difficulties that  there  may  be  in  re-
    establishing himself but note his motivation that he has  expressed  to
    change his life and that he is still a young man and  find  that  those
    difficulties are outweighed  by  the  strong  public  interest  in  his
    deportation.

129.  Consequently, we do not consider that  his  deportation  would  breach
    his Article 8 human rights.

130. We find, accordingly, that the appellant has failed to  establish  that
    he falls within the exceptions set out at Section 33 of the UK  Borders
    Act 2007 and his appeal must be dismissed under the  immigration  rules
    and on human rights grounds.

DECISION

131. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  an
    error on a point of law and  the  decision  has  accordingly  been  set
    aside. We re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal on all grounds.
