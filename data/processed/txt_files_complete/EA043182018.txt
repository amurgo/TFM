                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Nigeria, was born on 15 September 1975.  He
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary
    of State, which is dated  5  June  2018,  to  refuse  to  issue  him  a
    residence card. The First-tier Tribunal, in a decision  promulgated  on
    26 March 2019, dismissed the appeal. The appellant  now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The grant of permission reads as follows:

         "It is arguable that there  is  been  a  procedural  error  as  the
         Tribunal Service was informed on 2 January  2019  and  also  on  18
         January 2019 that the appellant wish to have his appeal  considered
         at an oral hearing. The judge was informed of this and  18  January
         2019. On 19 January  he  stated  that  he  had  already  written  a
         decision up and that it just needed proofreading, although  he  has
         dated the decision 18 January 2019. However, it was not promulgated
         until 20 January 2019 [should read 26 March 2019]."

 3. At the initial  hearing  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  Mrs  Pettersen,  who
    appeared for the Secretary of State, agreed that the judge had erred in
    law. It was clear that the appellant had wanted an oral hearing and the
    judge had determined the appeal on the papers. She submitted that  this
    amounted to a procedural irregularity and the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal should be set aside.

 4. I agree. The judge appears to have ignored or  overlooked  the  request
    for an oral hearing. He should not, knowing that the  appellant  wanted
    an oral hearing, have proceeded to determine the appeal on the papers.



Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  was  promulgated  on  26
    March 2019 is set aside. The  appeal  is  returned  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for that tribunal to remake the decision  at  or  following  a
    hearing.
