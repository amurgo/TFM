                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Dickson made following a hearing at Bradford on 30th January 2014.

Background

 2. The Claimant is a citizen of Turkey. He married  the  Sponsor  on  28th
    July 2010 and  subsequently applied for entry clearance to come to  the
    UK as a spouse, but was refused. They have a son, Ilyas, born  on  30th
    April 2011.

 3. The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Claimant was in a position
    to meet the maintenance requirements of the Rules.

 4. There is in fact an error in the judge's decision in that he appears to
    believe that the level of income required is �18,600, plus  �3,800  for
    the child, but in fact there is no additional amount in respect of  the
    child since he is in the UK.

 5. At the time of the application the Sponsor earned an annual  income  of
    �16,224 which has subsequently slightly reduced because she  now  works
    fewer hours.

 6. The judge purported to allow the appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules
    with respect to EX1 of Appendix FM but Miss Pickering conceded that  he
    was wrong to do so since EX1 is not a standalone provision and does not
    apply in entry clearance cases.

 7. He also allowed the appeal on the basis of the decision in MM &  Others
    [2013] EWCA 1900 (Admin) which concerns the minimum  income  provisions
    of the maintenance Rules when  applied  to  Sponsors  who  are  British
    citizens. Mr Justice Blake held that they could be  a  disproportionate
    interference with the right to respect to family life under Article  8.



The Grounds of Application

 8. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal both on the  grounds
    that the judge had erred in law in respect of his  decision  under  the
    Immigration  Rules  and  in  respect  of  MM.   The  grounds  make   no
    submissions that this case is distinguishable from MM but are a  direct
    challenge to that authority which, it is submitted,  is  unsafe  and  a
    usurpation of the democratically  accountable  decision  maker  in  the
    formation of policy.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Blandy for the reasons stated
    in the grounds on 27th February 2014.

10. On 13th March 2014 the Claimant served a response arguing that this  is
    simply an attempt by the Secretary of State to reargue  her  case.   MM
    has not been successfully challenged by the Secretary of State and  the
    FTT could not be criticised for  applying  case  law  relevant  to  the
    matters in issue which has not been overturned.

Submissions

11. Mrs Pettersen accepted that MM was persuasive authority  but  submitted
    that the original refusal was proportionate because the Sponsor was  in
    a position to meet the  income  threshold  in  the  future;  there  was
    nothing compelling about her circumstances which required a decision on
    Article 8 grounds to be made in her favour.

12. Miss Pickering submitted that this case was  entirely  consistent  with
    the  decision  in  MM  and  the  Secretary  of  State's  challenge  was
    effectively a backdoor challenge to that decision and  not  appropriate
    in this forum.

Findings and Conclusions

13. So far as the Immigration Rules is concerned, the judge erred in law in
    applying paragraph EX1.   The  Claimant  cannot  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules and on that basis his appeal should have been
    dismissed.  To that extent the judge's decision is set aside.

14. With respect to the decision in Article 8, in  MM,   Mr  Justice  Blake
    wrote as follows:

         "Although there may be sound reasons in favour of the  sum  of  the
         individual requirements taken in isolation, I  conclude  that  when
         applied to either  recognised  refugees  or  British  citizens  the
         combination of more than one of the following five features of  the
         Rules to be so onerous in  effect  as  to  be  an  unjustified  and
         disproportionate interference with a genuine spousal  relationship.
         In particular that it is likely to be the case  where  the  minimum
         income requirement is combined with one or more  than  one  of  the
         other  requirements  discussed  below.   The  consequences  are  so
         excessive in impact as to be beyond a reasonable  means  of  giving
         effect to the legitimate aim.

         The five features are:

         (i)  The setting of the minimum income level to be provided by  the
             Sponsor at above the �13,400 level identified by the Migration
             Advisory Committee as the lowest maintenance  threshold  under
             the benefits and net fiscal approach (conclusion 5.3).  Such a
             level would be close to the adult minimum wage for a  40  hour
             week.  Further the Claimants have shown by their experts  that
             of the 422 occupations listed in the 2011  UK  earnings  index
             only 301 were above the �18,600 threshold.

         (ii) The requirement of �16,000  before  savings  can  be  said  to
             contribute to rectify an income shortfall.

         (iii)    The use of a 30 month period for forward income projection
             as opposed to a twelve month period that could be applied in a
             borderline case of ability to maintain.

         (iv) The disregard  of  even  credible  and  reliable  evidence  of
             undertakings of third  party  support  effected  by  deed  and
             supported by evidence of ability to fund.

         (v)  The disregard of the spouse's own earning capacity during  the
             30 month period of initial entry."

15. In this case the Sponsor, a  British  citizen,  earns  well  above  the
    �13,400 level identified by the Migration Advisory Committee and  cited
    by Mr Justice Blake.  She also has over �16,000 worth of savings.

16. There is nothing distinguishable in her circumstances from those in the
    Appellants in MM.  The judge was entitled to rely on the  authority  of
    the High Court and to allow the appeal on that basis.

Decision

17. The decision with respect to the Immigration Rules is set aside.  It is
    remade as follows.  The appeal is dismissed.

18. The decision with respect to Article 8 stands.
