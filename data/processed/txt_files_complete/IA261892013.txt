For the Respondent:    Ms C Physsas, Counsel instructed by Selva & Co


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of  State
    refusing her application for leave to remain in the UK as  a  dependent
    spouse  was  allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Birk  under  the
    Immigration Rules, Article 8 of the ECHR and s.47 of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

2.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ievins  granted  the  Secretary  of  State
    permission to appeal on one ground only; that it is  arguable  that  in
    requiring the respondent i.e. Secretary of  State  to  request  missing
    evidence went beyond the  evidential  flexibility  policy  set  out  in
    paragraph 245AA of the Immigration.

3.   Judge Ievins said that the grounds in respect of the  judge's  findings
    on Article 8 amounted  to  no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  those
    findings.  With regard to the judge's decision allowing the appellant's
    appeal against the s.47 removal directions,  he  said  that  the  judge
    erred in law in failing to appreciate that s.47 had been amended  on  8
    May 2013 allowing the Secretary of State  to  give  written  notice  of
    removal at the same time as giving notice of  a  pre-removal  decision.
    Both the reasons for refusal letter and the notice of refusal  to  vary
    leave to remain and the decision to remove were  dated  17  June  2013,
    which was after the coming into force of the amended s.47.

4.   The respondent first entered the UK  as  a  dependant  on  her  student
    husband on 20 September 2005.  She was granted  leave  valid  until  30
    April 2007 on the same basis.  She was then granted  further  leave  to
    remain until 30 April 2009.  In the meantime her husband  had  switched
    to Tier 1 (Post-study  Work)  Migrant  under  the  Points-Based  System
    (PBS). On 20 October 2008 she was granted further leave  to  remain  in
    the UK as a dependant of a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)  Migrant  until  20
    October 2010.  On 13 December 2010 she was granted further leave on the
    same basis until 13 December 2012.

5.   On 22 August 2012, he applied for indefinite leave to remain in the  UK
    under the Long Residence Rules, having completed ten years'  continuous
    lawful residence in the UK.  The respondent however could not apply for
    settlement under the Long Residence Rules since she had  not  completed
    ten years' legal residence in the UK.

6.   As the respondent's leave to remain was due to expire  on  13  December
    2012, she applied for further leave to remain in the UK.  It is said in
    the grounds of appeal that she sought advice from the Home  Office  and
    they advised her that she should make the application on  form  FLR(M),
    which she duly did on 26 November 2012. At section 2.1 of form  FLR(M),
    the respondent ticked the box saying she was applying for an  extension
    of stay in the UK as the spouse of a person present and settled in  the
    UK even though her husband did not have settled status at the time.  At
    section 12 the appellant said her partner's passport was  with  another
    part of the UKBA.  She gave her husband's name, date of birth, passport
    number and reference number.  She submitted with  her  application  her
    passport, financial documents of her husband,  his  payslips,  P60  and
    bank statements.

7.   I am told that the respondent's husband was  granted  indefinite  leave
    to remain on 6 March 2013.  On 8 March 2013 a  copy  of  her  husband's
    grant of indefinite leave to remain was sent to the UKBA in support  of
    her application.  The argument here was that by sending this letter the
    Secretary of State would have been aware  that  her  husband  had  been
    granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  and  would  have  invited   the
    respondent to submit any missing  documents  in  consideration  of  her
    application.  This did not happen.

8.   On 17 June 2013, the Secretary of State refused the  application  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.   The  Secretary  of  State  had
    considered the respondent's application on the basis  of  her  marriage
    with a person settled in the UK (as stated by her  at  section  2.1  of
    form FLR(M)) and had  contended  that  the  respondent  had  failed  to
    satisfy the financial  requirements  for  leave  to  remain  under  the
    Immigration  Rules.   The  Secretary  of  State  contended   that   the
    respondent was required to meet the �18,600 financial  requirement  and
    the payslips of the sponsor provided by the  respondent  did  not  show
    sufficient income to meet the financial requirements of the Rules.

9.   Mr Saunders submitted that the respondent  had  confused  the  UKBA  by
    stating on her application form that her husband was settled in the UK.



10.  I am told that a letter explaining the  situation  was  sent  with  the
    respondent's application to the Secretary of State.  I do  not  have  a
    copy of this letter. However, because the respondent had said that  her
    husband had settled status when she made the application, the Secretary
    of State considered the application under Appendix FM.  I was  told  by
    Counsel that under appendix FM the respondent was  required  to  submit
    six months'  payslips  of  her  partner  leading  up  to  the  date  of
    application to show that she met  the  �18,600  financial  requirement.
    This evidence was available.  The Secretary of State should have  asked
    the respondent to submit the missing documents as required by the Upper
    Tribunal's decision in Rodriguez (flexibility policy) [2013] UKUT 00042
    (IAC).

11.  At the hearing below it was  contended  by  the  Secretary  of  State's
    representative that the Tesco statements for October and December  2012
    and for BP did not show  sums  going  into  the  account  to  meet  the
    standard and that there was no requirement to seek evidence that  could
    not be in existence at the time of the application.   The  judge  found
    that the financial information that was provided by the respondent with
    her application form did not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The respondent accepted that it was only with the provision  of
    further documentation that she could show that she met  the  Rules  for
    the application that she had made.  The judge said this  depended  upon
    the flexibility policy being applied by the Secretary of State to  such
    applications.  She found that it was reasonable for  the  policy  which
    was the subject matter in the case of Rodriguez for  the  Secretary  of
    State to seek the  missing  information.   Including  that  information
    showed that the financial requirements were met.

12.  Permission was granted  on  the  basis  that  the  judge  required  the
    Secretary of State to request missing  evidence  in  a  way  that  went
    beyond the evidential flexibility policy set out in paragraph 245AA  of
    the Immigration Rules.

13.  Mr Saunders relied on the  Court  of  Appeal's  decision  in  Rodriguez
    [2014] EWCA Civ 2 in which it  said  that  the  evidential  flexibility
    policy and paragraph 245AA  of  the  Immigration  Rules  only  bear  on
    applications made under the Points-Based System (PBS).  Paragraph 245AA
    is included in the PBS under Part 6A.  He said that this is a  marriage
    case which has nothing to do with the  PBS.   There  was  therefore  no
    requirement on the Secretary of State to ask for other evidence.

14.  Counsel said it was odd that in the grounds,  the  Secretary  of  State
    relied on paragraph 245AA.  She  argued  that  Appendix  FM-SE  to  the
    Immigration Rules relates to such an application.  Appendix  FMSE  sets
    out the specified documents that must be provided by an  applicant  and
    it is only those documents that are reconsidered by the respondent.

15.  Counsel accepted that  the  respondent  did  not  provide  six  months'
    payslips; she submitted  only  three,  namely  September,  October  and
    November payslips of her husband.  She  also  accepted  that  the  bank
    statements did not show that the earnings were going into  his  NatWest
    Bank account.  The Santander account was the cohabitation account.  She
    further submitted that the respondent was not required to show that she
    met the financial requirement because at the time  of  her  application
    her husband did not have indefinite leave to remain.

16.  From the  facts  I  find  as  follows.   On  the  advice  of  UKBA  the
    respondent submitted a form which  is  used  by  an  applicant  who  is
    dependent on a partner who has leave to  remain  under  the  PBS.   The
    respondent mis-stated the status of her husband,  claiming  at  Section
    2.1 that he had settled status when he did not.  The Secretary of State
    made a decision on the respondent's application on  16  July  2013  and
    applied the Rules under Appendix FMSE  which  required  her  to  submit
    specified documents namely six months' payslips or bank  statements  to
    show that her husband was earning �18,600 a year in order to  meet  the
    financial requirement.  However the application which  was  made  under
    the PBS did not require her to meet a specified  financial  requirement
    or submit such evidence because she  was  granted  leave  to  enter  or
    remain as a partner following an application made before 9  July  2012.
    The respondent completed Section  7B  of  the  application  form  which
    required her to answer questions about  her  maintenance.   It  was  to
    satisfy the maintenance requirement that the respondent  submitted  the
    financial documents that she did.  The Secretary  of  State  considered
    those documents but found that they were not  sufficient  to  meet  the
    requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  According  to  Counsel  the
    respondent was required under Appendix FMSE to submit 6 months payslips
    leading up to the date of application.   I  find  that  the  respondent
    could not satisfy this requirement.

17.  I accept that Rodriguez  which  is  about  the  evidential  flexibility
    police and paragraph 245AA of  the  Immigration  Rules  only  bears  on
    applications under the Points-Based  System.  I  find  that  the  judge
    materially erred in law  in  applying  Rodriguez.  I  accept  that  the
    respondent was advised by the UKBA to complete  form  FLR(M).   I  find
    that the respondent confused the Secretary of State by  misrepresenting
    her husband's status. In any event by the time the Secretary  of  State
    made her decision, the respondent's husband had acquired settled status
    and she was expected to meet the financial requirement in Appendix  FM-
    SE.  She was not able to meet this requirement for the reasons given by
    the Secretary of State.

18.  I find that the judge  materially  erred  in  law.   I  set  aside  his
    decision allowing the respondent's appeal.

19.  I remake the decision and allow the Secretary of State's appeal.
