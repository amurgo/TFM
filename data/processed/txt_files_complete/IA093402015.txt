                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Clarke   sitting   at   Richmond
    Magistrates' Court on 23 September 2015) allowing the claimant's appeal
    against the refusal of leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student  Migrant  on
    the ground that the refusal decision dated 19 January 2015 was  not  in
    accordance with the law.   The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an
    anonymity direction, and I do not consider that the  claimant  requires
    anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

Relevant Background

 2. The claimant is a national of Pakistan,  whose  date  of  birth  is  25
    February 1984.  He first entered the United Kingdom  on  5  April  2011
    with valid entry clearance as a student.  On 24 August 2012 he  applied
    for leave to remain as a student.  The application was  refused  on  16
    August 2013 with a right of appeal.  In a  decision  promulgated  on  3
    July 2014 the appellant's appeal was remitted back to the Secretary  of
    State to allow him 60 days to find fresh  sponsorship  and  for  a  new
    decision to be made.

 3. On 3 December 2014 the Home Office issued the claimant with  a  60  day
    letter.   In  the  letter,   which   was   addressed   to   his   legal
    representatives, the Home Office said that the decision to  revoke  the
    licence of Hendon Business School on 3 April 2013 meant  that  the  CAS
    that their client had submitted with his outstanding application  (made
    on 24 August 2012) was no longer valid and at present  his  application
    would fall to be refused.  But before the final decision was made,  and
    in  line  with  the  Rules  and  Guidance,  the  consideration  of  his
    application was going to be suspended for a period of 60 calendar days.
     During the 60 day period it was open to their client to  withdraw  his
    application and submit a fresh application in a different  category  or
    to leave the United Kingdom.  If he wished to remain in  the  UK  as  a
    Tier 4 Student, it was open to their client to obtain a new CAS  for  a
    course of study at a fully licensed Tier 4 educational sponsor and then
    to  submit  an  application  to  vary  the  grounds  of  his   original
    application.  In order to assist their client in obtaining a  new  CAS,
    they were enclosing with the letter an information leaflet  which  they
    could take to any potential  new  sponsors.   Also  enclosed  with  the
    letter was a certified copy of their client's passport.  If they decide
    to obtain a new CAS, then their client's sponsor would need to see  and
    retain this copy.

 4. His 60 day period would end on 1 February 2015. No  further  extensions
    beyond the 60 day calendar day period would be allowed.   The  decision
    would be reached on the application after the end of the 60 day period.
     If their client failed to submit a new valid  CAS  together  with  the
    required supporting documentation within the 60 day  period,  then  his
    application would  be  considered  on  the  basis  of  the  information
    currently available and would therefore fall to be refused.

 5. On 19 February 2015 the Home  Office  issued  a  refusal  letter.   The
    period of 60 days afforded to the claimant  had  ended  on  1  February
    2015.  But no response had been received to  date  in  respect  of  the
    letter dated 3 December 2014.  So his application had been assessed  on
    the documentation previously submitted and available  at  the  time  of
    consideration.  His application fell to be refused under 322(9) of  the
    Rules, and also under paragraphs 245ZX(a) and 245ZX(c) of the Rules.





 6. On the following day, 20 February 2015, the claimant's solicitors wrote
    to the Home Office seeking an extension of time for their client to get
    a CAS.

 7.  On  20  March  2015  the  Home  Office  responded  to  the  claimant's
    solicitors, thanking them for  their  letter  dated  20  February  2015
    regarding an extension of time for their client to get a CAS.  However,
    the application for leave to remain had  already  been  refused  on  19
    February 2015.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. Both  parties  were  legally  represented  before  Judge  Clarke.   The
    appellant gave oral evidence, and adopted as  his  evidence-in-chief  a
    witness statement dated 18 September 2015.

 9. After the Home Office had issued a 60 day letter, he  began  to  search
    for institutes and began preparing his application.  He did not want to
    risk having a CAS issued prior to his application being  made.   On  17
    January 2015 he had an accident in which he had injured his  back.   He
    stayed in bed for two days, and on the third day his  friend  called  a
    taxi and took him to the doctor.  He suggested full bed rest  and  also
    arranged for him to have an x-ray.  The doctor issued him with  a  sick
    note, which he forwarded to his legal  representatives.   He  requested
    the Home Office be informed of his situation in order to extend the  60
    day period.  His  representatives  forwarded  everything  to  the  Home
    Office, but the refusal letter  was  issued  "prior  to  receiving  the
    documents".  Under cover of the letter dated 20 March  2015,  the  Home
    Office returned the sick note which his representatives had provided.

10.  He  asked  that  the  Tribunal  should  take  into  consideration  his
    unfortunate circumstances, which were beyond his control.

11. In his subsequent decision, the judge said the  claimant  had  provided
    two reasons for failing to provide a valid CAS.  Firstly, he was unable
    to advance his university applications until such time as he had  a  60
    day letter from the Secretary of State.  Secondly, following  his  fall
    on 17 January 2015 he was bedridden for  a  couple  of  days,  and  was
    referred for x-rays and he subsequently received physiotherapy.

12. The judge found that the claimant had  been  proactive  in  seeking  to
    obtain a valid CAS once he received the 60 day letter.  An  example  of
    him being pro-active was that he had obtained a bank statement from his
    mother to show the funds that he had available.  Furthermore,  when  he
    realised that he would not  be  able  to  attend  the  various  sponsor
    colleges  in  the  latter  part  of  January  2015,  he  contacted  his
    representatives and took steps to inform the Home Office of his plight.
     The judge was also conscious  that  the  60  day  period  spanned  the
    Christmas and New Year holidays when colleges  and  universities  would
    have been closed.  His finding that the claimant had  made  efforts  to
    secure a sponsor was confirmed by the evidence that was before him that
    the claimant  had  now  secured  a  conditional  offer  from  Middlesex
    University, and it was clear that he had the requisite funds in  place.
    He had paid a deposit of �3,000 in respect of the  total  fees  due  of
    �18,100.  The judge continued in paragraph [23]:

         "It is well established in the case law that the  appellant  has  a
         legitimate expectation that the respondent will act fairly.  I find
         that there is a lack of fairness for the respondent  to  delay  for
         five months due to his 60 day letter and yet  in  less  than  three
         weeks make a decision to refuse the application.  I find  that  the
         appellant was proactive in  obtaining  his  documentation  but  was
         hampered in his efforts by  his  fall  of  17  January  2015.   The
         appellant also informed the respondent  of  his  circumstances  and
         asked the respondent to exercise his discretion.  It is  not  clear
         from the Reasons for Refusal Letter  what  matters  the  respondent
         took into consideration in which he decided that discretion  should
         not be exercised in favour of the appellant.  In the absence of the
         respondent failing to justify the exercise  of  her  discretion,  I
         find that the impugned decision is not in accordance with the law."

The Application for Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

13. A member of the specialist appeals  team  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  It was submitted that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge simply could not find that the  Secretary  of
    State had acted unfairly, bearing in mind what the Court of Appeal  had
    said in EK (Ivory Coast) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    [2014] EWCA Civ 1517 at paragraph [38].

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

14. On 12 April 2016 First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade granted the Secretary
    of State permission to appeal as it was arguable that the judge did not
    have good grounds to  find  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  acted
    unfairly in all the circumstances.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

15. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, there was no appearance by or on behalf of  the  claimant.   There
    was also no Rule 24 response on file.

16. Mr Tufan relied on the Court of Appeal decision in Kaur v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 13 in  which  Burnett  LJ
    said at paragraph [41]:

         "The points-based system for determining whether to grant leave  to
         enter or remain in the United Kingdom, which applies to students as
         well as a number of other categories of applicant, is  designed  to
         achieve predictability, administrative  simplicity  and  certainty.
         It does so at the expense of discretion,  that  is  to  say  it  is
         prescriptive.  The consequence is that failure to comply  with  all
         its detailed requirements will usually lead to a  failure  to  earn
         the points in question and thus refusal ...  It was that  important
         background which informed the decision in EK (Ivory Coast)."







17. Burnett LJ went on to say in paragraph [42] that EK  (Ivory  Coast)  is
    binding authority on the question of whether  the  Secretary  of  State
    should, as a matter of fairness, give notice to an applicant for  leave
    to remain or to the Tier 4 sponsor that she considers  there  to  be  a
    deficiency in the CAS before making an adverse decision on that  basis:
    "There is no such obligation."

Discussion

18. The judge has clearly erred in his assessment  of  the  evidence.   The
    judge has failed to distinguish between the information that  was  made
    available to the Secretary of State before  the  date  of  decision  as
    distinct from the information that arrived later.  On a careful reading
    of the claimant's witness statement, the claimant  does  not  in  terms
    assert that his representatives sought an extension of  time  before  a
    decision was made on his application.  On the contrary, the implication
    is that the plea for an extension of time, together with the supporting
    evidence, arrived too late.  The plea for an extension,  together  with
    the sick note, did not reach the Home Office until some time  after  20
    February 2015, whereas the decision on the application had been made on
    19 February 2015.  So there was no evidential platform  for  a  finding
    that the Secretary of State had failed to consider whether to grant the
    claimant an extension of time in the light of the representations  made
    by his representatives, and the accompanying sick note.

19. The judge also misdirected himself in law in failing to  recognise  the
    limited circumstances in which the Tribunal can  grant  relief  on  the
    grounds of a breach of the common law duty of fairness.  In  comparison
    to the generality of students who from time to time are issued with  60
    day letters following  the  revocation  of  a  sponsor's  licence,  the
    claimant was at an advantage, as the 60 day letter did not come out  of
    the blue.  He knew that it was coming.  The fact that he did  not  know
    precisely  when  it  was  coming  did  not  prevent  him  from   making
    preliminary enquiries of  potential  sponsors  so  as  to  be  properly
    prepared once the 60 day letter arrived.

20. Following EK (Ivory  Coast),  the  Secretary  of  State  was  under  no
    obligation to enquire as to  the  reasons  why  the  claimant  had  not
    provided a new CAS within the time limit of 1 February 2015.   Further,
    even if the Secretary of State had taken into account that the  60  day
    period included the Christmas and New Year holiday season and also that
    the claimant had been partially incapacitated for the last two weeks of
    January 2015, she had made it clear in the letter of  3  December  2014
    that it was her policy to require strict compliance  with  the  60  day
    time limit.

21. It was within the wide ambit of the Secretary of State's discretion  to
    be satisfied that the refusal remained appropriate and that she was not
    prepared to exercise discretion in the claimant's  favour.   Since  the
    Secretary of State had purported to exercise discretion, albeit not  in
    the claimant's favour, the claimant was not entitled to relief  on  the
    ground that the Secretary of State had not exercised discretion at  all
    (see UKUS) or  on  the  ground  that  she  should  have  exercised  her
    discretion differently (see Patel).





Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the claimant's appeal against the decision to  vary  his  leave
to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant,  and  against   the
concomitant decision to remove him under Section 47  of  the  2006  Act,  is
dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
