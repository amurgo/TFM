                             MUHAMMAD ADIL ANSAR
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the determination of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lloyd-Smith dismissing  his  application  for
    further leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  pursuant
    to paragraphs  245ZX(9)(c)(d)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  as
    amended.

 2. On 7 August I heard the appeal and found that the decision contained  a
    material error of law requiring the decision to be remade.  I indicated
    that it would not be necessary for there to be a further oral  hearing,
    but gave leave for written submissions within 14 days, to  include  (if
    so advised) submissions dealing with the question of an oral  hearing..
    No such submissions have been received.

Conclusions

 3. The appeal is allowed  to  the  extent  that  the  appellant's  amended
    application, based on the CAS from Guildhall College dated  5  November
    2012, remains before the Secretary of State for a valid decision.
