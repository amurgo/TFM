Representation:
For the Appellant: No appearance.
For the Respondent: Ms Petersen Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. On the 14th July 2014  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Duff was set aside for the reasons given in the error of  law
        finding document of the  15th  July  2014.  Directions  were  given
        thereafter for the matter  to  be  listed  for  a  case  management
        hearing in light of the pending country guidance case  relating  to
        Libya.


     2. In the interim the first appellant made a formal claim for  asylum.
        The interview took place on  the  1st  September  2014.   When  the
        matter next returned to the Upper Tribunal, on  the  8th  September
        2014, the respondent's decision letter had  not  been  served.  The
        case was therefore adjourned for a further hearing.


     3. At the  subsequent  hearing  it  transpired  that  the  appellants'
        application had been refused, he has been relocated to Cardiff, and
        he has lodged an appeal against the refusal which is listed  to  be
        heard by the  First-tier  Tribunal  sitting  at  Newport  in  early
        January 2015. The new solicitors in Cardiff are not  on  record  as
        acting in this matter.


     4. The appeal was  adjourned  for  clarification  of  the  appellants'
        position in relation to this matter. On 10th October 2014 the  case
        was called on but with no attendance on behalf of the  appellants'.
        Directions were given for Hallidayreeves to confirm the appellants'
        current address in Cardiff and for clarification  to  be  given  in
        relation to whether the appeal is to be withdrawn.  The  directions
        contain the following wording:


     "In the absence of any response it shall be assumed the appellants'  no
   longer     wish to proceed with the Upper Tribunal cases and  the  matter
   shall be disposed of    accordingly on the 12th December  2014  by  Upper
   Tribunal Judge Hanson."


     5. There was  no  attendance  on  behalf  of  the  appellants'  today.
        Hallidayreeves confirmed in a fax dated 21st October 2014 that they
        had forwarded the directions to Duncan  Lewis  in  Cardiff.   I  am
        satisfied  both  representatives  are  aware  of  the  hearing  and
        directions made. In light of the specific wording of the direction,
        the lack of attendance, the lack of explanation for the lack  of  a
        response, and  the  overriding  interests,  the  decision  of  this
        tribunal in the absence of any indication that the appellants' wish
        to continue with the litigation and lack of evidence  to  establish
        the claim is that the appeals are dismissed.

Decision

     6. The First-tier Tribunal Judge has been  found  to  have  materially
        erred in law and his decision set aside. I remake the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


     7. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  I
        continue that order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson

Dated the 12th December 2014
