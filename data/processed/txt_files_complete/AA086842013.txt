Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Robinson of Counsel instructed by Coram
                  Children's Legal Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Morocco born  on  30  October  1996.   He
    left Morocco in 2011 travelling through Spain and he arrived in the  UK
    on 22 March 2011.  He was put on a boat back  to  Spain  the  following
    day.  He again left Morocco in January 2012 and arrived in the UK on 29
    January 2012, applying for asylum on 31 January 2012.  He had an asylum
    interview booked for 27 April 2012 but did not attend.  On 26 September
    2012 he was convicted  of  burglary  and  sentenced  to  a  nine  month
    referral order.  He ran away from his foster carers  in  January  2013.
    He had an asylum interview on  19  April  2013.   His  application  was
    refused on 5 July 2013.

2.   The appellant appealed and his  appeal  came  before  First-tier  Judge
    Chamberlain on 3 December 2013.  The appellant was represented then, as
    he is now by Ms Robinson.

3.   The judge heard oral  evidence  from  the  appellant  as  well  as  his
    appropriate adult and key  worker.   The  judge  refers  to  the  Joint
    Residential Guidance Note number 2 of 2010: Child, Vulnerable Adult and
    Sensitive Appellant Guidance.  The judge reminded herself in  paragraph
    22 of the case of Karanakaran [2000] Imm AR 271 including the  duty  to
    evaluate all the material made  available  and  the  country  situation
    generally.  In paragraphs 23 to 26 of the determination the judge  made
    findings as to the appellant's credibility:

         "23. I did not find the Appellant to be a credible witness.   I  am
             mindful of the Appellant's age, and mindful of the evidence of
             Ms. Hogg and also Dr. Perrin regarding his state of mind,  but
             I find that at the date of the hearing the  Appellant  was  17
             years old.  I find that although he is still a  child,  he  is
             not so young that he did not understand the importance of  the
             hearing.  I found him  to  be  evasive  in  his  answers,  and
             unwilling  to  answer   questions   put   to   him   regarding
             inconsistencies in his evidence.  He became irritated  by  the
             questions put to him by the Respondent's representatives and a
             break had to be taken in order for the  Appellant  to  compose
             himself.


         24.  At the hearing the Appellant was asked whether he had  sniffed
             glue in the United Kingdom and he said that he  had  not.   At
             paragraph 10.4 of Dr. Perrin's report, the Appellant  admitted
             to sniffing glue.  This inconsistency was put to the Appellant
             and he answered that this was different to what he  was  using
             in Morocco.  I find that the question was put to the Appellant
             simply and reasonably, and the Appellant's failure to tell the
             truth  at  the  hearing  in  regard  to   this   damages   his
             credibility.


         25.  I have considered the Appellant's  behaviour  in  relation  to
             section 8 of the 2004 Act.  Bearing in mind  the  age  of  the
             Appellant, I do not find that the Appellant's behaviour on his
             first arrival in  the  United  Kingdom  in  2011  damages  his
             credibility, although  I  note  that  the  Appellant  on  that
             occasion did not mention that he was in fear for his  life  in
             Morocco.  However I find that the Appellant's behaviour  since
             his arrival in 2012 does cast doubt on  his  credibility  even
             bearing in mind his age.  I  find  that  he  failed  to  claim
             asylum in Spain or France on his way to the United Kingdom  in
             2012.  I find that  he  failed  to  attend  his  first  asylum
             interview in 2012.  I find that he  admitted  in  his  witness
             statement that he has not always told the truth.  Even bearing
             in mind the Appellant's age, I find his  behaviour  since  his
             arrival in the United Kingdom in  January  2012  is  behaviour
             which falls under section 8 and accordingly I  find  that  his
             credibility is damaged.


         26.  I find that the Appellant has been open that he has not always
             told the truth to the Respondent  since  his  arrival  in  the
             United Kingdom.  I find that he said he did this  to  confuse.
             I find that there  are  many  discrepancies  in  his  evidence
             between that he gave when he first arrived, and that given  in
             his later witness statement in April 2013.  These  go  to  the
             core of his claim as they relate to his life in Morocco.  They
             include matters such as the death of his father, when he  left
             home to start living on the streets, what work he did and  who
             borrowed  money.   I  find  these  significant   discrepancies
             between the first witness statement  made  in  February  2012,
             shortly after his arrival, and the second one  made  in  April
             2013, cast doubt on his  claim.   I  find  this  is  the  case
             despite his age."

4.   The judge rejected the claim that  50,000  dirhams  had  been  borrowed
    from money lenders for detailed reasons given in paragraphs  27  to  32
    and rejected the claim that he had  a  fear  of  returning  to  Morocco
    because of owing a debt.

5.   In the concluding part of the determination the judge  dealt  with  the
    risk on return.  In paragraphs 34 to 37 the judge found as follows:

         "34. The Appellant gave evidence that his mother  is  still  alive.
             He said that he did  not  know  her  whereabouts  and  it  was
             submitted that their relationship had broken down.  However as
             I have not found the Appellant to  be  a  credible  witness  I
             cannot rely on this claim.  I find that although the Appellant
             said that he was not close to his mother, he  also  said  that
             his mother was prepared to borrow 50,000 dirhams  for  him  to
             leave Morocco.  I do not find that this is consistent with the
             claim that their relationship had broken down.


         35.  The Appellant's evidence as to when he had left home  to  live
             on the streets is not consistent.  He said that his father had
             died before he  left  school,  but  then  later  changed  this
             evidence to say that his father died when he was 11 years  old
             and by this time he was not living with his parents.  He  said
             he only knew about  his  father's  death  because  there  were
             people gathered around his house.  I find that this change  in
             the Appellant's evidence casts doubt on  his  account  of  his
             life in Morocco.


         36.  The Appellant's representative submitted in her skeleton  that
             the Appellant, as a street child, had suffered at the hands of
             the  police.   I  find  in  the  Appellant's  statement  dated
             February 2012 he did not  mention  any  ill-treatment  at  the
             hands of the police.  I find that he only  mentioned  this  in
             his statement in April 2013.  I find this casts doubt  on  his
             claim.  I have considered the objective evidence of Dr. Joff�.
              As I have not found the Appellant's  account  of  his  family
             situation to be true, I do not find that there is  any  reason
             for him to be living on the streets.  I do not find that he is
             to be considered as somebody who would be on his own on return
             to Morocco.


         37.  In relation to the Appellant's age, I find the Appellant is  a
             child but as I have found above his is not an orphan.  I  have
             considered the case of LQ  in  this  regard  but  I  have  not
             accepted the Appellant's evidence regarding  his  relationship
             with his mother.  In the case of LQ  it  was  found  that  the
             Appellant was an orphan who would be at risk.  However in  the
             Appellant's case I do not find that he  is  an  orphan  and  I
             therefore find that he would not be returning to live  on  the
             streets as a child but would be returning  to  live  with  his
             mother."

6.   The judge went on to dismiss the appeal on all grounds.

7.   The grounds settled by Ms Robinson take  three  points.   The  Tribunal
    had  erred  in  not  giving  the   country   expert   evidence   proper
    consideration:  had  misinterpreted  the  appellant's   behaviour   and
    demeanour and failed to consider Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship
    and Immigration Act when approaching the appellant's evidence  and  had
    given Section 8 a status and a  compartment  of  its  own  rather  than
    taking it into account as part of a global assessment  of  credibility.
    The Tribunal had failed  to  take  account  of  the  detailed  evidence
    provided by the appellant giving reasons for his delayed disclosure  of
    pertinent information  about  his  life  in  Morocco.   Permission  was
    granted by First-tier Judge Lloyd on 15 January 2014.   On  30  January
    2014 a response was filed by the Secretary of State.  It was noted that
    the judge had not believed that the appellant would be forced  to  live
    in Morocco as a street child and it was not shown that  the  judge  had
    acted in any way that could be said to have contravened Section 55  and
    the best interests of the child.  No material error  of  law  had  been
    identified in the judge's treatment of issues arising under Section  8.
    The appellant has filed a response.  The fact that  the  appellant  was
    not a street  child  in  Morocco  did  not  mean  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's approach to the expert evidence was not flawed.  More weight
    should have been given to the objective evidence bearing in  mind  that
    the appellant was a child under paragraph 351 of the  Rules.   Reliance
    was placed on DS (Afghanistan) [2011] EWCA Civ 305 where the  Court  of
    Appeal had stated at paragraph 71 that the Tribunal should  have  borne
    the obligation under Section 55 when deciding  the  appeal.   Reference
    was also made to ZH (Tanzania) [2011]  UKSC  4.   In  relation  to  the
    appellant's demeanour the appellant was often emotional and  angry  and
    the Tribunal had acted irrationally and had  failed  to  discharge  its
    functions in accordance with Section 55  and  apply  the  guidance  for
    vulnerable witnesses when this was held as evidence  of  the  appellant
    not being credible.

8.   Counsel referred to the three strands of her argument - (a) not  giving
    the expert evidence proper consideration: (b) misdirecting  herself  in
    respect of the appellant's demeanour: and (c) misdirecting  herself  in
    relation to the application of Section 8.  There was  further  evidence
    from Michelle Hogg in a letter of 28 February 2014 going to  the  issue
    of the appellant's demeanour.  She was not present in the courtroom  on
    the day of the hearing when  the  appellant  was  giving  evidence  but
    sought to provide possible  explanations  as  to  why  the  appellant's
    conduct might have been interpreted  by  the  judge  as  it  was.   She
    referred to her earlier evidence about how the appellant  reacted  when
    he had been informed that he could not open a  bank  account.   He  had
    become upset during the hearing and the judge had erred in holding  his
    behaviour against him.  The judge had been in error in not taking  into
    account the best interests of the child and  Section  55  although  she
    accepted that section 55 had not been raised.

9.   In relation to Section 8 the Tribunal's approach had  been  unclear  in
    saying that it was  not  holding  the  appellant's  behaviour  in  2011
    against him on the one hand but  noting  that  the  appellant  had  not
    mentioned that he was in fear of his life in Morocco at  that  point  -
    see paragraph 25 of the determination.  Too much weight had been  given
    to Section 8.

10.  Mr Tarlow relied on his reply and submitted  that  the  judge  had  not
    believed that the appellant would be returned to live on his  own.   He
    would be returned to live with his mother and there was no need to give
    extensive consideration to the expert report in the premises.

11.  In relation to the appellant's  demeanour  the  judge  noted  that  the
    appellant had become irritated and that a break was taken.  Section  55
    had not been raised and it was not an error not to deal  with  it.   It
    was clear that the judge had dealt with the appellant being a child and
    had borne that in mind - see paragraph 6  of  the  determination.   The
    findings were adequately reasoned.  There was no material error of law.

12.  Ms Robinson  submitted  that  while  the  judge  did  not  believe  the
    appellant had she taken the expert material  into  account  this  might
    have made a difference to her findings.

13.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision if it was materially
    flawed in law.

14.  In relation to the judge's approach to the evidence  of  the  appellant
    given that he was a child, Mr Tarlow points out that in paragraph 6  of
    the decision the Tribunal stated that she was mindful of the fact  that
    the appellant was a child and that she had  borne  this  in  mind  when
    considering when considering the credibility of the evidence.   I  have
    already referred to what she said in paragraph 21 about  being  mindful
    of the Joint Presidential Guidance Note relating to  Child,  Vulnerable
    Adult and Sensitive Appellant Guidance.  She indeed  spoke  to  Counsel
    and the appropriate adult about the matter.

15.  In paragraph 23 - which I have set out above - the judge for the  third
    time  reminds  herself  about  the  appellant's  age  when  making  her
    credibility assessment.  It was for her to form an  impression  of  the
    witness before her and she found him to be  evasive  and  unwilling  to
    answer questions.  Mr Tarlow makes the point that the judge records the
    appellant becoming irritated and a break had to be  taken.   I  do  not
    find that this reference is an indication  that  the  judge  improperly
    relied on the appellant's demeanour.  The judge gave a  break  when  it
    became apparent that the appellant had  become  irritated.   I  am  not
    satisfied that the judge neglected to conduct the hearing in accordance
    with the guidance or took unfair points against the  appellant  because
    of his demeanour.

16.  It is said that the judge erred in relation to Section 8.  However  she
    gave him the benefit of the doubt  about  his  first  arrival  although
    Counsel takes the point that the judge noted that he had not  mentioned
    a fear of life in Morocco at that stage.   I  do  not  find  that  this
    indicates muddle or confusion in the judge's approach to Section 8.  It
    is quite clear from paragraph 25 that the judge was concerned with  the
    appellant's behaviour since his arrival in  2012.   Again  I  note  the
    judge had fully in mind the appellant's youth at that stage as she adds
    the words, "even bearing  in  mind  his  age".   The  judge  noted  the
    appellant had failed to claim asylum en route and had failed to  attend
    his first asylum interview.  The appellant had admitted that he had not
    always  told  the  truth  and  concluded  "even  bearing  in  mind  the
    appellant's age, I find his behaviour since his arrival in  the  United
    Kingdom in January 2014 is behaviour which falls under  Section  8  and
    accordingly I find that his  credibility  is  damaged."   Moreover  the
    appellant had admitted he had not always told the truth  and  had  done
    this in the judge's view to confuse.  There were many discrepancies  in
    the appellant's evidence which went to the  core  of  his  claim.   The
    judge was entitled to find the discrepancies  to  be  of  significance.
    Again she reminds herself about the appellant's age.

17.  The judge as I have said went into detail about the  appellant's  claim
    in paragraphs 27 to paragraphs 32 of the  determination.   The  precise
    order in which a judge sets out findings is not material.  It is  quite
    plain that Section 8 formed a proper part of the judge's evaluation  of
    the evidence.  The judge in my view was not wrong in law to  take  into
    account the appellant's behaviour in the  circumstances  of  this  case
    having had due regard to his young age.

18.  In relation to the expert evidence  I  have  already  referred  to  the
    judge's self-direction  in  paragraph  22  and  the  duty  to  evaluate
    material about the country situation.  She  confirms  in  paragraph  20
    that she had taken into account  the  documents  provided.   She  makes
    express reference to the objective evidence of Dr Joff� in paragraph 36
    of the determination.  Mr Joff� refers to the appellant's  belief  that
    money lenders will seek to recover the monies lent from his  mother  in
    paragraph 15 of his opinion and in paragraph 67 to the  fact  that  the
    appellant would be severely personally disadvantaged if he is  returned
    to Morocco and does not or cannot return to his mother.

19.  The judge simply did not accept  the  appellant's  evidence  about  his
    family situation and rejected the claim that money was lent  and  found
    that he would not be returning to live on the streets as  a  child  but
    would be returning to live with his mother.  The judge states that  she
    had considered the objective evidence of Dr Joff� and I have no  reason
    to doubt that she did.  I do not find  that  she  failed  to  give  the
    entirety of the material before her proper and anxious  scrutiny.   She
    had full regard to the fact that the appellant was a child and did  not
    neglect to look at the entirety of the evidence in that  light.   There
    was no conflict in  her  duty  to  have  regard  to  the  child's  best
    interests and her findings and assessment.  I  do  not  find  that  she
    failed  to  give  appropriate  weight  to  the  objective  and  country
    information in all the circumstances.  The judge's approach was not  in
    conflict with ZH (Tanzania) or DS  (Afghanistan)  or  indeed  her  duty
    under Section 55.

20.  For the reasons I have given the decision is not materially  flawed  in
    law and this appeal is dismissed.

21.  The anonymity direction made by the First-tier Judge continues.
