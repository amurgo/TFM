Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Balroop, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 8  January  1997.    He
    arrived in the UK in 2007 as a student.  He made an application  on  12
    December 2014 for further leave to remain on Article 8  grounds.   That
    application was refused in a  decision  dated  11  February  2015.  The
    appellant's appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Coaster  ("the
    FtJ") at a hearing on 3 March 2016 whereby she dismissed the appeal.

 2. There had been an application for an adjournment on the  basis  of  the
    appellant's health. It was contended that he was not able to attend the
    hearing because of medical conditions. The FtJ refused the  application
    for an adjournment, went on to determine the appeal  and  dismissed  it
    with reference to Article 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The grounds of appeal upon which permission to appeal has been  granted
    are most clearly identified at [3] of  the  grounds  to  the  following
    effect: the FtJ's decision to refuse to grant  an  adjournment  and  to
    proceed with the appeal in the appellant's absence was an error of law.
     It is also argued that Article 8 was a matter that  should  have  been
    resolved in his favour.

 4. Otherwise the grounds, which I do not think were prepared by Mr Balroop
    on behalf of the appellant and who did not  appear  below,  are  rather
    general in nature and  do  not  really  condescend  to  particulars  in
    relation  to  the  appellant's  case.   That,  it  seems  to   me,   is
    illuminating for reasons which I shall come on to.

 5. In submissions on behalf of the appellant Mr Balroop referred me to the
    medical evidence that was before  the  FtJ  which,  it  was  submitted,
    indicated that he was unfit to attend the hearing. The phrase  used  in
    the letter from the Saluja Medical Centre dated 12 February  2016,  was
    that it would be "quite an ordeal" for the appellant to attend  and  it
    was submitted that that indicated that the appellant  was  not  fit  to
    attend the hearing.

 6. I note that the appellant lives in Southall, Middlesex and the  hearing
    was at the hearing centre at Newport in Wales.

 7. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the FtJ took a  rather
    narrow view of  the  medical  evidence,  and  which  was  not  fair  or
    justified on the facts.

 8. Ms Isherwood submitted, with reference to various aspects of the  FtJ's
    decision, that she was perfectly entitled to take  the  view  that  she
    did, bearing in mind that there had been a previous adjournment and the
    FtJ was entitled to take into account  that  this  was  a  last  minute
    application for an adjournment. The application for an adjournment  was
    made on 26 February 2016 which was a Friday and the hearing was on  the
    following Thursday, 3 March.

 9. What Mr Balroop submits, I think with some force,  is  that  until  the
    hearing date was  close,  having  regard  to  the  appellant's  medical
    conditions, it was not to be known whether or not he would  be  fit  to
    attend and that if the application for an adjournment had been made too
    far in advance of the hearing  the  response,  understandably  perhaps,
    would have been that it was premature to say that the  appellant  could
    not attend.

10. To put my decision into context it is necessary to refer to some  other
    features of the FtJ's decision. She noted the previous application  for
    an adjournment and she referred to the medical evidence that was before
    her.  There was a letter from the Saluja  Clinic  which  was  dated  12
    February 2016.  The clinic referred to the appellant's health condition
    which was that he had ongoing back pain.   The  letter  referred  to  a
    lumber muscle sprain, chronic back pain and  visual  disturbance.   The
    letter stated that the appellant travelling to  the  hearing  would  be
    "quite an ordeal", and again in this context I note that the  appellant
    lives in Southall and the hearing was in Newport.

11. The FtJ noted that the appellant could have instructed  his  solicitors
    to attend his home in order to prepare a witness statement and for  him
    to provide any documents that he relied on.  She also made reference to
    the submissions made on behalf of the appellant. She concluded that the
    appellant's solicitor's letter exaggerated what was said in the  letter
    from Saluja Clinic.  She said that the evidence did not state  that  he
    was not fit to travel or to give evidence or that travelling  would  be
    detrimental to his health.  She accepted that it may well be  that  the
    appellant has a musculoskeletal problem but there was no evidence  that
    he was not able to travel to the hearing and the medical  evidence  did
    not say so.

12. She concluded at [21] that from the evidence she had seen and from  the
    submissions, the appellant did  not  want  to  attend  the  hearing  in
    Newport but would be happy to attend a London hearing centre, according
    to what was argued at least.  She found that without  medical  evidence
    to support the claim that he was prevented from attending  the  hearing
    because of a medical condition, his stated preference  of  wanting  the
    case to be heard in London was not relevant.

13. She said at [11(vi)] that it would not be unreasonable to conclude that
    the appellant was not taking the publicly funded proceedings  seriously
    or that he had a cynical ulterior motive for persistently delaying  the
    hearing of the appeal.

14. At [36] she made a number of findings.   They  were  as  follows.   The
    appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 19 July 2007  on  a  student
    visa at the age of 20 years; that he lives alone  in  privately  rented
    accommodation and that he is in employment earning ï¿½1,200 a month.  She
    found that he did not receive any public funds, had no criminal history
    and had no dependants.  She also found that there is no evidence  of  a
    relationship with another person.  He had lived in  the  UK  for  seven
    years and four  months  at  the  date  of  the  application.  She  also
    concluded that he had visited Pakistan in January 2014 and that he  had
    a mother, two sisters and maternal cousins there where he  lived  until
    he was 20 years of age.

15. She went on to find that there was  no  evidence  of  family  life  and
    family life was not therefore engaged.

16. So far as private life is concerned, she made the findings to  which  I
    have referred and she concluded that  he  was  not  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Article 8 Immigration Rules  in  terms  of  private
    life. She asked whether there were "compelling grounds" to consider the
    appeal under Article 8 proper, that is  to  say  on  'pure'  Article  8
    terms.

17. She found that no doubt he would have acquired a private  life  in  the
    seven years that he had been in the UK and working, but  that  he  does
    not have a family life in the form of a partner  or  other  dependants.
    He did however, have family and extended family in  Pakistan  where  he
    had spent the first 20 years of his life.  He had recently visited  his
    family there and has ties to Pakistan.

18.  It  was  a  reasonable  assumption,  she  concluded,  that  he   could
    successfully and without difficulty reintegrate into his home  country.
    She said that there was no evidence that he could  not  reintegrate  or
    that for some weighty reason he could not return.  For  example,  there
    was no evidence of any serious medical condition.  She  concluded  that
    there was no evidence that he could not rebuild  his  private  life  in
    Pakistan and she said that in any event any private life accrued whilst
    in the UK was when his immigration status was precarious.

19. Finally, she concluded that  there  were  no  compelling  circumstances
    justifying a consideration of the appeal outside the Immigration Rules.
     Even if there were such circumstances, she found that the decision was
    in any a proportionate one.

20.  I  am  satisfied  that  overall  the  FtJ  undertook  a  comprehensive
    assessment of the evidence and reached a conclusion on the  adjournment
    issue that was open to her.   She did assess the issue on the basis  of
    fairness and came to the conclusion that there  was  no  unfairness  in
    proceeding with the hearing in the absence of the appellant.

21. There is a respect in which it seems to me the FtJ  was  wrong  on  the
    facts. That is at [8] whereby she  stated  that  the  letter  from  the
    Saluja Clinic dated 12 February 2016 was in exactly the same  terms  as
    that dated 3 September 2015.  In that respect she was mistaken  because
    the letter of 12 February 2016 had the addition that the appellant  had
    pain and numbness and weakness of the leg which would not allow him  to
    sit comfortably or mobilise without pain. Those features of the  letter
    were additional to those set out in the earlier letter.

22. Having said that, she did on more than one occasion refer to  what  was
    said in the letter about the ordeal which the letter  states  that  the
    appellant would have to undergo in travelling to Newport.

23. I am satisfied that the FtJ's interpretation of  the  medical  evidence
    formed a sufficient basis to justify her conclusion that  the  evidence
    did not establish that he was not fit to attend a hearing  or  to  give
    evidence. But in any event, she went on to consider the Article 8  case
    that was in fact presented. She applied the Article 8  Rules  correctly
    and  considered  quite  properly  whether  there   were   circumstances
    militating in favour of the appellant under Article 8 proper.

24. The argument in the grounds about the absence of  a  representative  it
    seems to me is disingenuous in the extreme.  It is said in the  grounds
    that  the  FtJ  proceeded  with  the  hearing  in  the  absence  of   a
    representative. However, that was because the  representative  withdrew
    and had said that he would withdraw if the adjournment request was  not
    granted.

25. This is a matter that is raised at [3(i)] of  the  grounds  complaining
    about the FtJ's failure to grant an adjournment and to continue to hear
    the case without the appellant or his representative being present.  On
    one view it could be said that that was a cynical manoeuvre on the part
    of the representative to put pressure on the judge to proceed with  the
    hearing and to enhance the prospects of any  onward  appeal.  But  that
    said, there was in any event no Article 8 case that had  any  prospects
    of success.

26. As I indicated at the outset, the grounds before the Upper Tribunal  do
    not engage with, or advance any basis upon  which  an  Article  8  case
    could possibly succeed. That, as I  said  earlier  on,  is  significant
    because there is still no material indicating the basis upon which  any
    Article 8 case could succeed.  The best that Mr Balroop could  do  with
    the lack of information provided to him was to rely on  the  length  of
    time that the appellant had been in  the  UK  and  the  extent  of  any
    private life that he will have established.  But that manifestly is not
    a sufficient basis from which to be satisfied that any Article  8  case
    had any prospect of success at all.

27. There is, and was, no bundle of documents on behalf of  the  appellant,
    no witness statement explaining the basis upon which any  appeal  could
    succeed and the case before the FtJ was not prepared  for  the  hearing
    before her. Even now it is not explained the basis upon which any  such
    case could succeed.  The Article  8  case  before  the  FtJ  was  fully
    considered on the  material  that  was  provided.   It  was  singularly
    lacking in potency and so even if it could be said that  FtJ  erred  in
    law in failing to adjourn the hearing, which I do not  consider  to  be
    the case, any error of law in that respect is not material.  It is  not
    explained how the outcome could possibly have been any different.

28. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.
