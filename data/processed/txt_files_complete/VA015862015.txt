Representation:

For the Appellant:        Mr P Duffy (Senior Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:     Mr P Saini

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision of the
   First-tier Tribunal of 17 October 2016 allowing  the  appeal  of  Sarwar
   Kousar, a citizen of Pakistan, itself brought against the refusal of her
   application to visit her children in the UK, made on 20 February 2015.


2. The judge below summarised the evidence before her. The  Appellant,  who
   worked as a nurse, lived in Pakistan with her own mother  following  her
   divorce from her husband some years ago; the Appellant  had  three  sons
   and a daughter in the UK: now they were aged respectively 23, 24, 26 and
   27. She was in touch with three of the four. One  son,  M,  had  arrived
   here in March 2013. He was seriously disabled and  his  doctor  had  now
   prohibited him from further travel; he required round the clock care.  A
   treating doctor stated that he suffered from  spastic  quadriplegia  and
   was wheelchair bound, and thus unfit to travel to Pakistan;  his  family
   reported that he was becoming distressed at his lack of contact with his
   mother.  A  Consultant  had  written  that  he  showed  some  degree  of
   unnecessary but it was difficult to interpret whether he was in any kind
   of discomfort.


3. The Judge accepted the historical facts underlying the claim,  and  then
   considered the viability of the appeal having regard to Article 8 of the
   ECHR, and the five stage test set out in Razgar.  She  did  not  believe
   that family life was established, because "There was no suggestion  that
   [assistance and support] was now provided by the appellant or that there
   were emotional ties above  and  beyond  those  of  a  normal  mother/son
   relationship ... the relationship does form an  important  part  of  the
   Appellant's private life" with which  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance
   interfered.


4. The First-tier Tribunal  accepted  that  the  Respondent  satisfied  the
   Immigration Rules for visitors, as there was evidence that she could  be
   maintained and accommodated during any stay and that she was  clearly  a
   genuine visitor who would not overstay her leave given  her  connections
   in her country of origin. It  directed  itself  that  there  had  to  be
   "sufficiently compelling circumstances" before a decision was identified
   as disproportionate. Applying that threshold, the  decision  was  indeed
   disproportionate to the private life engaged, because M could not travel
   to  Pakistan,  and  lacked  capacity  and  understanding   to   properly
   appreciate contact by other means such as modern means of communication.




5. The Secretary of State lodged grounds of appeal against  this  decision,
   and the First-tier Tribunal granted permission to  appeal  on  15  March
   2017 because the judge had arguably given insufficient reasons  for  her
   findings in the context of the elevated threshold required, particularly
   bearing in mind the fact that the authorities appeared not to  recognise
   the possibility of entry clearance being  granted  pursuant  to  a  pure
   private life claim.


6. Mr Duffy submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had essentially  allowed
   the appeal on the basis of private life connections within the UK, given
   its clear statement that  there  was  no  emotional  dependency  between
   mother and son exceeding the norm: that  was  impermissible  as  it  was
   generally understood that only Article 8 rights in the nature of  family
   life could suffice. Mr Saini argued that there was  an  overlap  between
   private and family life and that this was a compelling  case  given  the
   disabled child's inability to travel to visit the mother.


Findings and reasons

7. I reserved my decision at the hearing  before  me  and  now  provide  my
   findings and reasons. This was an application and appeal pursued  firmly
   outside  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  First-tier  Tribunal   correctly
   identified the basis of its  jurisdiction,  there  being  a  disjunction
   between the basis of visitor applications, which are primarily evaluated
   by the Entry Clearance Officer against the benchmark of the  Immigration
   Rules, and the available grounds of appeal, which are limited  to  those
   under the Human Rights Convention. As explained in Kaur (visit  appeals;
   Article 8) [2015] UKUT 487 (IAC), evidence relating to the ability of an
   appellant to meet the requirements of the Rules must be relevant to  the
   assessment of whether there is a violation of Article 8, there being  no
   significant "gap" between the visitor  rules  and  the  requirements  of
   Article 8 of the European Convention on  Human  Rights.  The  claimant's
   ability to satisfy the Immigration Rules is "capable of being a weighty,
   though not determinative factor when deciding whether  such  refusal  is
   proportionate".


8. There are clearly unsatisfactory aspects  to  the  decision  below.  The
   First-tier Tribunal at one point states that there is no family life  in
   play between the disabled child and the Appellant because  there  is  no
   emotional  dependency  exceeding  the  norm;  however,   elsewhere   its
   reasoning, accepting as it does the fact that the disabled adult child M
   misses his mother and is unable to communicate with her other  than  via
   personal physical contact, would appear to represent the very epitome of
   a case where there is indeed family life between mother and adult child.




9. It is necessary to look at the leading  authorities  on  the  nature  of
   family life between adults, and as to the overlap  between  private  and
   family life. As stated in Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy)
   [2012] UKUT 00160:


      "62. The different outcomes in cases with superficially similar
      features emphasises to us that the issue under Article 8(1) is highly
      fact-sensitive.  In our judgment, rather than applying a blanket rule
      with regard to adult children, each case should be analysed on its own
      facts, to decide whether or not family life exists, within the meaning
      of Article 8(1). As Wall LJ explained, in the context of family life
      between adult siblings:
           "We do not think that Advic is authority for the proposition
           that Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention can never be
           engaged when the family life it is sought to establish is that
           between adult siblings living together. In our judgment, the
           recognition in Advic that, whilst some generalisations are
           possible, each case is fact-sensitive places an obligation on
           both Adjudicators and the IAT to identify the nature of the
           family life asserted, and to explain, quite shortly and
           succinctly, why it is that Article 8 is or is not engaged in a
           given case."  (Senthuran v Secretary of State for the Home
           Department [2004] EWCA Civ 950).""


10. Thus in AA v United Kingdom (Application no 8000/08; 20 September  2011)
   the European Court of Human Rights stated that:


      "An examination of the Court's case-law would tend to suggest that the
      applicant, a young adult of 24 years old, who resides with his mother
      and has not yet founded a family of his own, can be regarded as having
      'family life'."


11. And the President of this Chamber of the Upper Tribunal stated  in  Lama
   [2017] UKUT 16 (IAC):


      "32 ...at its heart, family life denotes real or committed personal
      support between or among the persons concerned."


12. In Nhundu & Chiwera [2001] UKIAT 00613 ï¿½26  the Tribunal stated that


      "The Court views the private life concept as a broad one that includes
      not only the idea of an "inner circle" in which individuals  may  live
      their personal lives as they  choose  without  interference  from  the
      state; it also covers the right to develop one`s own  personality  and
      to create and foster relationships with  others:  Niemietz  v  Germany
      (1993) 16 EHRR 97. In the context of immigration and asylum cases, the
      Court has come to view the right to respect  for  private  and  family
      life as a composite right. This approach requires  the  decision-maker
      to avoid restricting  himself  to  looking  at  the  circumstances  of
      "family life" and to take into account also  significant  elements  of
      the much wider sphere of "private life" ..."


13. In Nasim, the Upper Tribunal revisited Lord  Carnwath's  formulation  in
   Patel at 57 (ie that Article 8  is  not  a  general  dispensing  power),
   invoking it in support of the proposition that Article 8 is of -
      " ..... limited utility to an individual where one has moved along the
      continuum, from that Article's core area of operation towards what
      might be described as its fuzzy penumbra."
14. Rix LJ in CH (Jamaica) [2007] EWCA Civ 792


      "it is necessary to remind oneself, as the immigration judge
      apparently did not, how relatively high the bar is set in this context
      in terms of a finding of an unjustified interference in private life,
      for all that the concept of private life is a broad based continuum,
      described in Lester & Pannick, Human Rights Law and Practice, 2nd ed,
      2004, at para 4.8.2 as "starting from an inviolable core of personal
      autonomy and radiating out...into personal and social friendships".
      Thus many of the essential notions of private life, such as bodily
      integrity, personal identity, sexual identity, and privacy, are not in
      focus in this context."



15. The conclusion to be drawn from these authorities is that the  existence
   of family life between an  adult  child  and  parent  is  essentially  a
   question of fact. It will doubtless be rare for family  life  to  endure
   between mother and son when they have lived apart in recent  years,  but
   where a young person has lived with a parent  relatively  recently,  and
   has subsequently become distressed at the lack of close personal contact
   with them, in circumstances where they are unable to meaningfully  enjoy
   close human  relations  absent  face-to-face  physical  contact,  it  is
   clearly possible to countenance the situation as one of enduring  family
   life.  Private  life  itself  takes  many  forms,  from  close  personal
   relationships that are akin to family life, to a person's  own  physical
   and moral integrity and to aspects of their personal identity. I have no
   doubt, given  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal was right to treat the relationship between mother and  son  as
   central to the identity of both, and as effectively one where there was,
   in truth, emotional dependency between  mother  and  son  exceeding  the
   norm.


16. In these circumstances I consider that the Secretary of State's  attempt
   to categorise the decision  as  one  permitting  a  form  of  Article  8
   interest that is too remote from core family life to justify  the  grant
   of entry clearance to be misguided. The reality is that either the First-
   tier Tribunal treated the relationship as the  very  strongest  form  of
   private life that is akin to a  family  life  interest;  or  it  wrongly
   described its factual  findings,  themselves  unimpeachable  and  indeed
   unchallenged, as constituting private rather than family life.


17. This is accordingly  an  appeal  where  the  enjoinder  in  Piglowska  v
   Piglowski [1999] 1 WLR 1360 (endorsed in the immigration context  in  EA
   [2017] EWCA Civ 10 ï¿½27) is relevant: "reasons  should  be  read  on  the
   assumption that, unless he has demonstrated the contrary, the judge knew
   how he should perform his functions and which  matters  he  should  take
   into account ... [an] appellate court should resist  the  temptation  to
   subvert  the  principle  that  they  should  not  substitute  their  own
   discretion for that of the judge by  a  narrow  textual  analysis  which
   enables them to claim that he misdirected himself". I am confident  that
   any infelicities of expression in the First-tier Tribunal's decision  do
   not constitute a material error of law and I dismiss the appeal.

          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  contain  a  material
    error of law.
    The appeal is dismissed
