                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge O'Hagan, promulgated on 9th January 2017, following a hearing  at
    Birmingham,  Sheldon  Court,   on   21st   December   2016.    In   the
    determination,  the  judge  dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,
    whereupon the Appellant subsequently  applied  for,  and  was  granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of  India,  who  was  born  on  16th
    January 1989.  He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    16th July 2015, refusing him leave to remain in the UK as  the  partner
    of a Romanian national.

 3. It was a feature of this appeal that the Appellant and  the  Respondent
    had indicated that they wanted the appeal to be dealt with on the basis
    of information recorded in the papers without a hearing.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed that, "the crux of the matter is that the  Appellant
    applied under the Rules  relating  to  partners  of  British  nationals
    rather  than  under  the  different  provisions  for  partners  of  EEA
    nationals" (paragraph 3).

 5. The judge went on to observe that as the Appellant's partner was not  a
    British national, but a national  of  Romania,  "the  correct  law  is,
    therefore, the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006"
    (paragraph 4).  It was unclear whether the Appellant was married to his
    Romanian national partner.

 6. This was a case where there  had  been  "the  Respondent's  failure  to
    identify that the Appellant made the wrong application" (paragraph  5).
    The judge concluded that the Appellant "needs to apply for a  residence
    card as the married or  unmarried  partner  of  an  EEA  national  ..."
    (paragraph 6).

 7. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The essence of the grounds of application are that the judge failed  to
    recognise that  there  was  no  mandatory  requirement  under  the  EEA
    provisions to use the EEA FM correct application  form,  as  was  being
    suggested by the judge, so  that  the  judge  accordingly  should  have
    considered the correct law under the EEA Regulations as  the  Appellant
    had a partner who was an EEA national.  The judge failed to have regard
    to the Article 8 assessment.

 9. On 15th August 2017,  permission  to  appeal  was  granted.   This  was
    accompanied by the observation that, "whilst the  judge  was  bound  to
    consider the decision actually made by the Respondent, it  is  arguable
    that the case should have been  remitted  to  the  Respondent  for  the
    correct Rules to be  considered"  which  were  the  Rules  relating  to
    partners of EEA nationals.  This was  even  though  the  Appellant  had
    applied on the form that related  to  partners  of  British  nationals,
    because there was no mandatory requirement that a  particular  kind  of
    form should be used when there was an application on behalf of partners
    of EEA nationals.





Submissions

10. At the  hearing  before  me  Mr  Samra,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant, submitted that this was  a  case  where  the  Appellant  had
    actually paid �872 in fees for an application for partners  of  British
    nationals, whereas had he applied on the basis of a partner of  an  EEA
    national, he would at the time have paid only �55.  Accordingly, he had
    nothing to gain but everything to lose by not using the  correct  form,
    as suggested by the judge.  However, the reality was that if one looked
    at the EEA (FM): Guidance Notes, these make it clear that,

         "It is not mandatory to use the EEA (FM) application  form  but  it
         will assist us in dealing with your application more efficiently if
         you do.  Even if you choose not to use this form, you must pay  the
         specified fee, submit the relevant supporting  documents  and,  'if
         you are a non EEA national' give your biometric information".

    Mr Samra submitted that, for whatever reasons, the Appellant's previous
    solicitors  used  an  incorrect  form,  but  there  was  no   mandatory
    requirement that an EEA form should be used.  The documentary  evidence
    was clear that the Appellant and his EEA national partner  were  living
    together and the matter should now accordingly be remitted back to  the
    primary decision-maker to evaluate the matter on that basis.

11. For her part,  Mrs  Aboni  relied  upon  her  Rule  24  response.   She
    submitted  that  there  was  no  material  error.   The  Appellant  had
    submitted  an  application  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  and   the
    application was considered under Appendix FM.  There  was  insufficient
    evidence to show that the relationship between the  Appellant  and  his
    Romanian partner satisfied the Rules.  Therefore, the judge was correct
    (at paragraph 4) to state that, "it is not clear whether the  Appellant
    is married to his partner ...".  It was for the Appellant to  make  out
    his case.  He had not been able to make it out in the appeal before the
    judge.  The judge had been correct to decide as he did.

12. In reply, Mr Samra  submitted  that,  if  one  is  to  have  regard  to
    paragraph 4, then one must look at it in its  entirety,  and  here  the
    judge makes  it  clear  that,  "the  correct  law  is,  therefore,  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006".   If  that  was
    the case, submitted Mr Samra, then the judge ought to  have  considered
    the appeal on the basis of the EEA  Regulations.   These  only  require
    there to be a "durable relationship" and do not  specify  a  particular
    period of time that a person has lived with their partner.

13. The evidence was clear  that  the  parties  satisfied  the  law.   More
    importantly,  there  was  no  requirement  that  the  Appellant  use  a
    specified form.  The form used should have enabled the primary decision-
    maker to look at the application on the basis of EEA  law.   Similarly,
    the appeal, even if heard on the papers, ought to have been  considered
    by the judge under EEA law, and not under Appendix FM.



Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.

15. It is clear that, "it is not mandatory to use the EEA (FM)  application
    form" as stated in the EEA (FM): Guidance Notes.  Of course, the use of
    the correct form "will assist us in dealing with your application  more
    efficiently if you do", according to the Guidance  Notes  of  the  Home
    Office, and this is precisely what has happened here, namely, that  the
    application  has  not  been  considered  more  efficiently,  or  indeed
    accurately, as was necessary in the circumstances of this case.

16. However, the use of the incorrect form should still  have  enabled  the
    primary decision-maker to apply EEA law and  to  look  to  see  whether
    there was a  "durable  relationship"  between  the  Appellant  and  his
    Romanian national partner.  The evidence before the  primary  decision-
    maker was that the parties were living together.

17. In the same way, the failure of the primary decision-maker  to  so  do,
    should not have obviated the need on the part of the judge  on  appeal,
    to also apply EEA law, and a failure to do so was also a  misdirection.



18. In the circumstances,  since  the  initial  application  has  not  been
    properly considered, this matter ought to be remitted back to the  Home
    Office to  make  a  decision,  on  the  basis  of  the  application  as
    originally submitted, under the EEA law Regulations.   This  appeal  is
    allowed to that extent.

Notice of Decision

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside. I set aside the decision  of
    the original judge.  I re-make the decision as follows.  This appeal is
    allowed to the extent that the Home Office is directed to consider  the
    Appellant's application on  the  basis  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  and  not  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant's partner is a British national.

20. No anonymity direction is made.

21. This appeal is allowed.
