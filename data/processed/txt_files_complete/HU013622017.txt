                                DETERMINATION


 1. Parties are as above, but for continuity and  ease  of  reference,  the
    rest of this determination describes them as they were in the FtT.

 2. This determination should be read in the context of the following:

      i) The respondent's decision dated 12 January 2017, giving her reasons
         for refusing the appellant's human rights  claim  and  for  finding
         that he is a foreign criminal whose deportation is conducive to the
         public good and to whom no exceptions apply.

     ii) Deportation order, of the same date.

    iii) The appellant's grounds of appeal  to  the  FtT,  attached  to  his
         notice of appeal filed on 17 January 2017.

     iv) The decision of the FtT (Judge Farrelly and Dr Winstanley) allowing
         the appellant's appeal, promulgated on 27 July 2017.

      v) The respondent's grounds of appeal  to  the  UT,  attached  to  her
         applications for permission dated 27 July and 14 September 2017.

     vi) The UT's decision promulgated on 5 December 2017, setting aside the
         decision of the FtT for error of law.

 3. The hearing on 16  January  2018  was  for  purposes  of  remaking  the
    decision of the FtT.

 4. The primary facts, not in contention, are these:

      i) The appellant is a citizen of Kenya, born in 1977.

     ii) Immigration history:  In the UK with leave  from  2003  to  January
         2010.  Application for  leave  on  30  January  2010,  rejected  as
         invalid on 26 February 2010.  Application for leave as an innovator
         on 1 October 2013, refused on 21 January 2014.   30  January  2014,
         served with papers as an overstayer.  Application for leave  on  20
         October 2015 on family life grounds, granted  on  29  January  2016
         (until 29 July 2018).

    iii) Criminal history: 29 December 2016,  dangerous  driving,  community
         payback order 100 hours, disqualified 2 years 6 months; failing  to
         provide  sample,  community  payback  100  hours;  5   July   2015,
         attempting  to  pervert  the  course   of   justice,   12   months'
         imprisonment (all at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court).

     iv) The appellant is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with  his
         partner, N, a UK citizen.  She is a medical graduate,  nearing  the
         end of her training as a GP.

      v) The appellant and his partner have two daughters, E, born  on  [  ]
         2013, and  another,  born  shortly  before  the  hearing,  both  UK
         citizens.

     vi) The appellant's daughter T was born on [ ] 2013.  His  relationship
         with her mother, A, ended before the child was  born.   Mother  and
         daughter are citizens of Eritrea, lawfully resident in the UK.  The
         indications are that their long-term future lies here.


 5. It is common ground that there is family life among the  appellant,  N,
    and their two daughters, also encompassing T, who regularly spends time
    with them.

 6. The three areas of evidence  disputed  were:  whether  the  appellant's
    offending involved any deliberation; whether he knew  that  he  had  no
    immigration status from 2010 - 2015; and the degree of difficulty which
    would be encountered by his partner and daughters if they were to  live
    in Kenya.

 7. The appellant adopted as his evidence-in-chief his prior statements, up
    to and including one dated  28  December  2017.   His  account  of  his
    offending is that when driving home he felt dizzy and so stopped  in  a
    layby; he did  not  know  he  had  been  trailed  by  the  police;  his
    recollection is very limited, until he woke next morning in a cell  and
    was referred to by a friend's name; the citation was  read  to  him  at
    4pm, when he could not believe what was happening, and panicked.

 8. In cross-examination the appellant was equally vague, and reluctant  to
    be drawn even on matters which must have been within his knowledge.  He
    accepted that he had another person's driving licence  in  his  wallet,
    and said that he might have taken it  out  in  error  for  the  police,
    rather than his own.  He had that licence because its  owner  has  gone
    back to Kenya, did not need his UK licence, and the appellant  used  it
    as an identity for his friend's trading activities.  He adhered to  his
    evidence that he drank 3 or 4 pints of lager, and that he suspected one
    of his drinks was "spiked".  The events not only of the  night  but  of
    the following day (when he appeared in court and was convicted under  a
    false name) were a blur.   He had been going to tell  his  case  worker
    about his conviction in another identity.  He had not noticed that  the
    fee of �820.00 for the application made in 2010 were never  taken  from
    his account.  He had at times been away from the address he  used  over
    that period, and had no knowledge of the decision being communicated in
    a recorded delivery letter to that address.

 9. In response to my question, the appellant said he had been due  to  see
    his case worker (presumably about carrying out  his  community  payback
    order) about 13 or 15 days after his conviction.  He was going to  tell
    the case worker that day, but the police called him before he could  do
    so.

10. There was no re-examination.

11. The appellant admits to  drinking  a  quantity  which,  even  if  true,
    indicates at least carelessness, if not  indifference,  about  drinking
    and driving.

12. An explanation of a "spiked drink" is easily invented.

13. The allegation of blurred memory conveniently avoids having to  explain
    dangerous driving,  giving  a  false  identity,  and  not  providing  a
    specimen for testing.


14. It is inherently unlikely that the only  information  the  police  took
    from the appellant was sight of a driving  licence.   Their  procedures
    involve the careful taking and recording of identity details.

15. If matters did unfold from the  unlucky  mishap  of  taking  the  wrong
    licence from his wallet, the appellant had  his  first  opportunity  to
    correct that when addressed by the wrong name  the  next  morning.   If
    that was not part of a  conscious  plan,  and  came  as  an  unpleasant
    surprise, there would no reason not to react by putting matters right.

16. It is easy to say that he later decided to correct matters,  but  there
    is little reason to believe it, when he had the chance over a  two-week
    period, and did not do so before he was caught out.

17. Events could only have transpired as they did by the appellant sticking
    persistently to a false identity.

18. The appellant  produces  a  letter  dated  6  February  2014  from  the
    respondent (item 8 of his inventory in the FtT) which  at  first  sight
    might support his contention that he did not know  about  his  lack  of
    immigration status.  However, on a more careful reading, the  sense  of
    the letter is, more likely, that he was not issued with a letter on  31
    May 2013, a date when he had a voluntary departure interview  with  the
    respondent.   The appellant's evidence when contending that he did  not
    know either that �820 was not taken from his account, or  that  he  had
    been sent a recorded delivery letter, was confused and unclear.  He has
    turned out otherwise to be generally a witness of no credibility.  This
    issue is also resolved against him.  It is not as  significant  as  his
    denials in matters of crime, but  it  is  part  of  his  general  ready
    avoidance of responsibility for his actions.

19. The reasons advanced  against  the  appellant's  partner  and  children
    moving to Kenya were based partly on what they would  lose  in  the  UK
    (which is not in dispute) and partly on what they would face there.  On
    the latter aspect, reference was made  to  difficulty  in  transferring
    medical skills to Kenya; language  barriers;  security  and  terrorism-
    related risks; the crime level; health and education.

20. It would be an understandable choice for the appellant's partner not to
    move to Kenya if he were to be deported.  She confirmed her evidence to
    that effect at the hearing, adding that she could not justify doing  so
    in the interests of the two children.

21. The evidence does not show that disadvantages  in  Kenya  would  be  as
    great as portrayed.  Information from the FCO in the appellant's bundle
    shows that while healthcare  is  expensive,  there  are  major  private
    hospitals with good facilities and highly trained staff.   Both  health
    and  educational  facilities  are  available  to   high   international
    standards.  They are not accessible to the mass of the population,  but
    the appellant and his partner are both well-educated and qualified.  He
    is a law and business graduate, and she is a medical doctor.  No  doubt
    there are differences, but there is no evidence  that  a  UK  qualified
    doctor would not be able to have her qualifications recognised  or  re-
    validated, or to obtain employment at an appropriate level.  English is
    widely spoken and a national language (along with Swahili).  There  are
    security worries, but every country  has  those  in  some  degree.  The
    family would be  among  the  privileged  not  among  the  disadvantaged
    classes.

22. In his submission, Mr Matthews applied firstly the rules and then  part
    5A of the 2002 Act, while Mr Winter preferred the reverse order, on the
    basis that statute comes first; if the case succeeded thereunder, there
    was  no  need  to  look  further;  and  s.117C  does  not  express  the
    requirement in �399 to show both that it is unduly harsh for a child to
    live in the country of deportation, and unduly harsh to remain  in  the
    UK without the appellant.  Matters are taken in the appellant's order.

23. 2002 Act, section 117B (1): The maintenance of immigration controls  is
    in the public interest.

24. S.117B (2):  The appellant speaks English.  S. 117B (3): The  appellant
    is not a burden on the state.  Those two factors are of no  significant
    force in the scheme of statute and the rules in respect of deportation.

25. S. 117B (4): Little weight is to be given  to  a  relationship  with  a
    qualifying partner (N) established at a time when the appellant was  in
    the UK unlawfully.  Mr Winter accepted that this  applies,  but  argued
    that "little weight" should be overridden as the case was  sufficiently
    strong, and as the appellant  had  been  granted  leave  based  on  the
    relationship.  This issue is subsumed into what follows.

26. S. 117C (1):  The deportation of foreign criminals  is  in  the  public
    interest.

27. S.117C (2):  The more serious  the  offence,  the  greater  the  public
    interest in deportation.

28. Mr Winter submitted that the offending was not at the most serious end;
    did not involve violence, sex crime, or drugs;  and  this  reduced  the
    public interest, and helped to show undue harshness.

29. The appellant did not help his case by minimising his offending  almost
    to vanishing point through a long series of incredible excuses.

30. The appellant's partner, more understandably,  was  also  reluctant  to
    face up to the seriousness of his offending.  She describes this  as  a
    "criminal case secondary to driving offences", which is an  unrealistic
    portrayal of  an  attempt  to  pervert  the  course  of  justice.   The
    suggestion that the outcome reflected deficiencies in legal advice  has
    no foundation.

31. The driving offences themselves were not trivial,  even  if  not  of  a
    nature leading  to  deportation.    The  Sheriff's  sentencing  remarks
    confirm that the attempt to pervert the course of justice was a serious
    offence, attracting 18 months imprisonment, but for the guilty plea.

32. However, the sentence, as Mr Winter said, comes  only  at  the  trigger
    point for automatic deportation.  The degree of harshness to  be  shown
    is not increased by the nature of the offending.  That exercise  begins
    at a neutral point.

33. The case then comes to s. 117C (5), exception 2: Whether the effect  of
    deportation on N and the 2 qualifying children would be  unduly  harsh.
    (T is not a "qualifying child" in the statutory scheme.)

34. Factors relied upon here were:

      (i)  The  children's  dual  ethnic  background.   I  accept  that  the
      appellant's presence in the UK would be of substantial  help  in  that
      respect.  However, there could hardly be a rule that a parent  of  the
      same ethnic background as the other parent and their child  is  to  be
      deported, but not  a  parent  of  a  different  background.   This  is
      relevant, but short of decisive.

      (ii)  The appellant pled guilty.  This is true, but he had no possible
      defence.  The offence by its nature is one of  defying  not  accepting
      justice.  This feature counts for little.

      (iii)  and (iv) Low risk of re-offending, and no significant  risk  of
      harm to others.  I accept both.  They reinforce the starting point  as
      a neutral one.

      (v) The appellant's wife works shifts, and there would be  child  care
      issues.  I accept this.  She would face difficulties.  As Mr  Matthews
      submitted, they would be the real but common difficulties of a  single
      working parent, many of whom are not in such good employment as N.

35. There is nothing in any of those factors which matches (or comes close)
    to the harshness of separation itself, which is inherent in deportation
    if family members do not choose to  accompany  the  deportee.   Nothing
    lifts this case significantly beyond the inevitable.

36. Account is taken of the appellant's submissions  that  factors  do  not
    need to be unusual or untypical; but if the  unduly  harsh  arose  from
    simply applying  the  statute,  that  would  be  a  circular  exercise,
    depriving the statute of meaning.

37. I conclude that s. 117C (5), exception 2, is not satisfied.

38. The appellant then turns to �399 (a) (ii) (a) of the rules: Whether  it
    would be unduly harsh for  the  2  children  to  live  in  Kenya.   The
    appellant argued:

      (i)  Loss of contact with T.  I accept that  if  they  move  to  Kenya
      contact with T will be  very  much  reduced,  restricted  probably  to
      holiday periods back in Scotland, and that would be a loss to all  the
      children.

      (ii)  No ties with Kenya.  This is true, but I have found  above  that
      it represents nothing more serious than is  regularly  encountered  by
      children moving around the world with their families, as many do.

      (iii)  Language issues.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  significant
      problem faced by English speakers in Kenya.

      (iv)  All their family are in Scotland.  The appellant appears to have
      one sister in Kenya, with whom he says he  has  little  contact.   The
      family is close to N's parents, brother and  others.   There  is  some
      substance  in  this.   Family  visits  in  both  directions  would  be
      possible, but given the time, distance and expense, would  perhaps  be
      annual at most.  Contact would be significantly reduced, but it  would
      not be extinguished.  (N and the children live in  Ayrshire,  and  her
      parents in Orkney.)

      (v)  They have accommodation in Scotland.  True, but neutral; there is
      nothing to suggest this is not  a  resource  which  might  be  of  use
      towards obtaining accommodation of a suitable standard in Kenya.

      (vi)  Their mother is in employment.  To obtain equivalent  employment
      may not be completely straightforward.  Equally, however, there is  no
      reason to  doubt  that  the  appellant  is  or  could  readily  become
      employable in Kenya.  There are sizable health  sectors,  both  public
      and private.

      (vii)  Their mother is fearful of the security situation.  Her concern
      is genuine, but there is no evidence of such general security concerns
      as might deter similar families from residing in Kenya.

39. The only aspect of the above which is not inherent in most deportations
    of a family member is factor (i), loss of contact with T.  It is common
    for children from separate but related nuclear families (such as  other
    half-siblings, step-children, or cousins) to grow up apart, and even in
    different countries.  This is unfortunate, but not a matter which makes
    it unduly harsh for the 2 children to live in Kenya.

40. I conclude that �399 (a) (ii) (a) is not satisfied.

41. In any event, the appellant would have to show that �399 (a)  (ii)  (b)
    of the rules is also satisfied: Whether it would be  unduly  harsh  for
    the children to remain in the UK without the appellant.   That  is  the
    same issue as under s. 117C (5), exception 2, on  which  I  have  found
    against the appellant above.

42. The appellant's case is put  finally  under  �398:  Whether,  �399  not
    applying,  the  public  interest  is  outweighed  by  very   compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in �399.

43. Factors  assessed  above  remain  relevant  at  this  stage,  which  is
    cumulative.

44. The target of circumstances which  go  over  and  above  those  already
    rehearsed, and which are not only compelling but  very  compelling,  is
    high.

45. All possible factors are set out in  the  written  submission  for  the
    appellant at 8 (i) - (xxiii).   Most  of  these  have  been  considered
    above.

46. At (v) and (vi) the appellant cites loss of  contact  with  T  and  her
    close relationship with E, and at (xvi) the fact that E and her  mother
    have no other family in the UK.  The loss of  any  substantial  contact
    between the appellant and T is  a  near  certainty,  and  reduction  of
    contact among the 3 children is another harsh result, but  this  is  of
    the nature of deportation, and not a very  compelling  circumstance  of
    the force required.

47. Factors (vii), (viii) and (ix) are the value of N to the community, the
    time and money spent on her training, and the struggles of the  NHS  to
    retain doctors.  Those are all valid points in themselves, but they are
    not of the nature sought by the rule. Those are matters of  the  public
    interest, which on this issue is fixed by statute.

48. The appellant's evidence  includes  strong,  heartfelt  expressions  of
    support from his partner, her parents, friends and colleagues.  Some of
    that chapter of the evidence characterises the deportation decision  as
    if it were an arbitrary whim of the executive.  Applying the law to the
    facts of the case, however, it is  a  clear  one,  leaving  little  (if
    anything) to discretion.  Deportation is plainly (if  not  unavoidably)
    an outcome which statute and the rules require, following  the  actions
    of the appellant.

49. Another way of testing the strength of the cumulative factors  weighing
    against the public interest in the  appellant's  deportation  might  be
    this: if he and his partner were to choose to move to Kenya with  their
    children,  that  would  not  call  for  any  intervention  of  the   UK
    authorities in the best interests of the children.  As the respondent's
    decision says at p.4, "Many parents reasonably and legitimately  choose
    to take their children to live in other countries".  Tens of  thousands
    of UK citizens live in Kenya.  Such  a  course  would  not  strike  any
    outside party as outrageous.

50. Every possible matter which might have been advanced has properly  been
    advanced, but the circumstances do not, even together, reach  the  high
    level demanded by �398.

51. The decision of the FtT has been set aside, and  is  remade  thus:  the
    appeal,  as  brought  by  the  appellant  to  the  FtT,  is  dismissed.



52. An anonymity direction  was  made  in  the  "error  of  law"  decision.
    Parties did not address the matter  further.    As  the  case  involves
    three young children, that direction is maintained.  Unless and until a
    tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  appellant   is   granted
    anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly
    identify him or any member of his family.  This direction applies  both
    to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to  comply  with  this
    direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                         22 January 2018
