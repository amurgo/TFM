                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Hemingway made following a hearing at Bradford on 31st October 2013.

 2. The claimant entered the UK on 10th May 2012 as a visitor. During  that
    period she met her sponsor, a British citizen, whom she since  married.



 3. She applied for a variation of her leave to remain on the basis of  her
    marriage but was refused because paragraph E-LTRP.2.1 prevents  persons
    coming  to  the  UK  as  visitors  seeking  to  switch  into  different
    categories.

 4. It was not argued that the claimant could meet the requirements of  the
    Rules.  The argument was put on Article 8 grounds.  The judge found the
    oral and documentary evidence to be  entirely  credible  and  that  the
    claimant had entered into a genuine relationship.  Her  husband  was  a
    self-employed taxi driver earning in the region of �18,000  to  �19,000
    per annum after tax which is of course approximately the level required
    by the Immigration Rules for the maintenance rules to be satisfied.

 5. The judge stated that he attached significant weight to the  importance
    of demonstrating that people who come to the UK as  visitors  ought  to
    return rather than seeking to switch status here.  On the  other  hand,
    she was in a genuine, loving and subsisting relationship and it was not
    submitted that it would be reasonable to expect the sponsor to relocate
    to Pakistan on a permanent basis,  particularly  since  the  claimant's
    family was hostile to the marriage. The claimant does not  have  a  bad
    immigration history because she genuinely came to the UK as  a  visitor
    and her subsequent application  was  as  a  consequence  of  unexpected
    events.  He said that the fact that the  Sponsor  was  earning  between
    �18,000 to �19,000 lessened  the  importance  to  be  attached  to  the
    economic  wellbeing  aspect  of  the  legitimate   aim   in   assessing
    proportionality.  On that basis he allowed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

 6. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the Tribunal had misdirected itself in law and it was only where  there
    were exceptional circumstances which  would  mean  that  removal  would
    result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  should  the  appeal  have
    succeeded on Article 8 grounds.  Secondly, the Tribunal had  failed  to
    provide  adequate  reasons  for   finding   that   removal   would   be
    disproportionate.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Renton on 27th
    November 2013.  Judge Renton stated that exceptionality was not a legal
    test but it was arguable that in assessing the weight to be attached to
    the public interest the judge failed to take into account the fact that
    the relationship upon which she relied was formed when her  immigration
    status was precarious.

The Hearing

 8. The Appellant did not appear.  Mr Diwnycz did not  concede  the  appeal
    but merely restated his grounds and made no further submissions.

 9. This is a thoughtful and well reasoned decision.  The judge plainly had
    in mind the Respondent's interests which he set out in  full.   However
    he made a series of unassailable and unchallenged factual findings,  in
    particular that this is a genuine  relationship,  that  the  claimant's
    family threatened to beat her if she returned to Pakistan, and that  it
    would not be to the UK's economic detriment were  the  claimant  to  be
    granted leave, given the earnings of her husband. Weighing all of these
    factors together, he was entitled to find that  the  interference  with
    her  Article  8  rights,  in  all   these   circumstances,   would   be
    disproportionate.  That was a judgment for him to make and there is  no
    legal basis for setting it aside.

Decision

10. The original judge did not err  in  law.   The  decision  stands.   The
    claimant's appeal is allowed.
