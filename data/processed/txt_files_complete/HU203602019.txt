                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND

1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
   Howorth promulgated on 7 February 2020 ("the Decision"). By the Decision,
   the Judge dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's
   decision dated 20 November 2019, refusing his human rights claim based on
   his family and private life in the UK.  The claim was made in the context
   of an application to remain as the spouse of a British citizen.


2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan.   He came to the UK as a
   student in December 2007.  His leave in that capacity came to an end in
   February 2010.  An application for a derivative residence card was
   refused and his appeal failed.  A further application made in March 2015
   was refused and the Appellant's appeal was dismissed.  The Appellant
   claimed asylum in May 2019 but withdrew that claim.

3. The Appellant has two convictions for sexual assault, in 2008 and 2009.
   The first led to a three-year community order, the second to a period of
   eight weeks in prison.  He was placed on the sex offenders' register for
   five years for the first offence and seven for the second.

4. The Appellant married his wife (hereafter "the Sponsor") in 2010.  The
   Sponsor was born in Pakistan.   She is now a British citizen.  She came
   to the UK in 1978 when she was a baby.  The Appellant's case is that he
   and the Sponsor care for her mother who also lives in the UK.  The
   Sponsor is said to suffer from mental health problems.  The Appellant is
   also said to suffer from depression.

5. The Respondent refused the Appellant's claim on suitability grounds on
   the basis that the Appellant's presence is not conducive to the public
   good.  The claim was also refused on the basis that the Appellant's
   family life could continue in Pakistan.  Accordingly, paragraph EX.1 of
   Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules ("EX.1") did not apply.  The
   Respondent also concluded that there would be no very significant
   obstacles to the Appellant's integration in Pakistan and accordingly he
   could not satisfy paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules ("the
   Rules").  It is not suggested that the Appellant could meet the residence
   requirements under paragraph 276ADE of the Rules. Outside the Rules, the
   Respondent considered the circumstances of the Appellant and the Sponsor
   but concluded that removal would not entail unjustifiably harsh
   consequences for them.

6. Judge Howorth upheld the Respondent's view about the Appellant's
   suitability ([23] of the Decision).  She went on to consider whether
   paragraph EX.1. applies.   She concluded that the Appellant and the
   Sponsor could relocate to Pakistan ([44]).  The Judge did not accept that
   there would be very significant obstacles to the Appellant's integration
   in Pakistan under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules ("Paragraph
   276ADE(1)(vi)") ([45]).  She found the removal of the Appellant to be
   proportionate ([46]).

7. The Appellant's grounds are not numbered but can be broadly grouped as
   follows:

      Ground one (� 2-6 of the grounds): challenge to the finding in
      relation to suitability.
      Ground two (�7-8 and 10 of the grounds): challenge to treatment of
      medical evidence.
      Ground three (�9 of the grounds): impermissible speculation in
      relation to alternative
      care for the Appellant's mother-in-law.
      Ground four (�11 of the grounds): impermissible speculation about the
      Sponsor's
      language abilities.
      Ground five (�12 of the grounds): wrong self-direction in relation to
      burden of proof.


   Overall, it is suggested that the Decision is Wednesbury unreasonable for
    those reasons
   and considered as a whole.


8. Permission to appeal was refused on 17 April 2020 by First-tier Tribunal
   Judge Fisher in the following terms so far as relevant:


         "...2.   The grounds seeking permission are extremely critical of
         the Judge, asserting that she did not 'fully understand the job at
         hand'.  The author of the grounds may wish to reflect on making
         allegations of that nature.  It is said that the Judge made a
         number of assumptions, but the grounds are part based on
         assumption.  The Judge was not bound to accept the expert opinion,
         provided that she gave adequate reasons for rejecting it.
         3.   I cannot accept the assertion that the Judge made findings
         which were irrational.  The threshold for establishing
         irrationality is high.  The Judge noted that the Appellant had not
         re-offended.  She was correct to attack little weight to medical
         evidence which was considerably out of date.  She was entitled to
         draw conclusions from the evidence.  That is part of the Judge's
         role.
         4.   In reality, these grounds are little more than a rather
         caustic disagreement with the Judge's findings.  They do not
         disclose any arguable error of law.  The Judge made findings which
         were open to her on the evidence and her reasoning is adequate.
         Permission to appeal is refused."


9. The Appellant renewed the application on the same grounds as set out
   above.  Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce on
   8 June 2020 in the following terms:


         "1.  It is unclear why the First-tier Tribunal, or the author of
         the grounds, was under the impression that the Respondent had not
         articulated that this 'suitability' refusal was being made on the
         grounds that the Appellant's presence is not conducive to the
         public good: the refusal letter says in terms that it was at page 4
         of 12.  As such it was for the Respondent to establish that the
         Appellant's character, associations or 'other reasons' made it
         undesirable for him to remain in the United Kingdom.  It is not at
         all clear from the decision that the First-tier Tribunal
         appreciated that this was where the burden lay: see paragraph 13.
         On one reading of paragraph 23 it is arguable that the Tribunal
         simply treated the Respondent's assertion as to undesirability as
         sufficient, instead of conducting its own assessment of the matter.
         2.   As to the substantive human rights appeal the grounds have
         less merit but I do not limit the grant of permission."


10. By a Note and Directions dated 3 July 2020 Judge Bruce reached the
   provisional view that it would be appropriate to determine the error of
   law issue without a hearing.  The Appellant's written submissions in
   reply did not address the forum for consideration of that issue.  They
   simply invited the Tribunal to set the Decision aside for the reasons set
   out in the grounds.  The Respondent similarly set out her position in
   relation to the grounds but without comment on the appropriate forum.  In
   reply to the Respondent's written submissions the Appellant indicated
   that there should be an oral hearing.  Having considered the submissions,
   Upper Tribunal Judge Mandalia directed that there be a remote hearing to
   determine the error of law issue.

11. So it is that the matter comes before me to determine whether the
   Decision contains an error of law and, if I so conclude, to either re-
   make the decision or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do
   so.  The remote hearing was attended by representatives for both parties.
   There were a few connectivity issues in the course of the hearing but
   those were overcome and the hearing proceeded with no major technical
   difficulties.


12. I have before me a small (unpaginated) bundle which was before Judge
   Howorth, and which I assume to be the Appellant's bundle (although there
   is no covering letter confirming that to be the case).  I also have the
   Respondent's bundle of core documents, the Appellant's skeleton argument
   for the First-tier Tribunal hearing, the various written submissions to
   which I refer at [10] above and written submissions prepared by Mr Melvin
   for the hearing before me.  I confirm that I have read those and taken
   them into account along with the oral submissions made.  I have referred
   however only to those parts of the documents and submissions which are
   relevant to my consideration.

13. For the purposes of my consideration of the Appellant's case, I have
   adopted the headings which I set out at [7] above concerning the broad
   scope of the grounds.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Ground One: Suitability

14. The Judge dealt with this issue at [18] of the Decision as follows:


         "18. The Respondent refuses the application of the Appellant not
         only on the non-acceptance of insurmountable obstacles, but also on
         Suitability grounds.  The Respondent made the decision to refuse
         the Appellant on the basis of his character, conduct and
         associations under R-LTR.1.1.(d)(i) which states:
           i) The applicant must not fall for refusal under Section S-LTR:
              Suitability leave to remain; and
         19.  It is unfortunate that the Respondent does not spell it out,
         but it should be clear that the Respondent is referring to the S-
         LTR.1.6. which states:
         S-LTR.1.16.   The presence of the applicant in the UK is not
         conducive to the public good because their conduct (including
         convictions which do not fall within paragraphs S-LTR.1.3. to
         1.5.), character, associations, or other reasons, make it
         undesirable to allow them to remain in the UK.
         20.  The Appellant was convicted of sexual assault in 2008 and
         2009.  The Appellant married the Sponsor in 2010 and there have
         been no further incidents of criminality subsequently.  The
         Appellant stated in oral evidence that whilst he is no longer
         required to sign the sex-offenders register, he would have [to]
         declare these convictions in future job applications.
         21.  I note that the 31 page skeleton argument submitted states
         that 'The Secretary of State confirmed that the Appellant satisfies
         S-LTR1.1-1.5'.  This may be the case but the Appellant has failed
         to address the Appellant's failure because of his character conduct
         and associations.
         22.  The Appellant's skeleton argument does state that a
         considerable time has elapsed since the Appellant's convictions,
         however I have no evidence before me in respect of sentencing
         remarks or rehabilitation that might show me anything about the
         offending or anything to do with how the Appellant has been
         rehabilitated and whether the Appellant is of any danger to the
         public.  I taken into account the type of offending as being of a
         particularly dangerous nature to the public and that the Appellant
         continued to be monitored, by way of the sex offenders register,
         for a considerable period after the offending (seven years from the
         second offence).  There are also two offences, presumably the
         sentence for the first, which did include a rehabilitative aspect
         as the Appellant was required to attend a course, had no impact in
         respect of preventing reoffending.
         23.  I find it concerning that the Appellant continued to be
         monitored for some seven years after the offending and there is no
         evidence before me of any report which indicates the risk the
         Appellant poses.  I do take into account there has been no further
         offending, but the failure to adduce any evidence of positive
         change does cause some concern to me.  I therefore find that the
         Respondent's decision to refuse the Appellant on the grounds of
         character, conduct and association to be reasonable in the absence
         of any evidence to the contrary other than oral evidence of the
         Appellant and Sponsor."


15. I can deal very swiftly with the assertion that it was not open to the
   Judge to raise suitability because the Respondent had not done so.
   Although there is no depth of reasoning in the Respondent's decision
   letter as to the suitability issue, the Respondent has clearly refused
   the claim on suitability grounds based on the non-conduciveness of the
   Appellant's presence in the UK.  The Judge was therefore correct to
   consider that issue.


16. There is however merit in the ground asserting that the Appellant was
   required to "prove a negative" ([4] of the grounds).  That is perhaps
   better formulated as in the permission to appeal grant as being the wrong
   apportionment of the burden of proof.  As Judge Bruce pointed out, it was
   for the Respondent to demonstrate why the Appellant's presence in the UK
   was not conducive.  The Judge's approach at [21] to [23] of the Decision
   appears to place the burden on the Appellant.  Furthermore, what is said
   at [23] of the Decision is a "rubber-stamping" of the Respondent's
   decision rather than a consideration by the Judge herself whether the
   Respondent's case on this point is made out.

17. I do not find of assistance the case of R (oao Ngouh) v Secretary of
   State for the Home Department [2010] EWHC 2218 (Admin) on which Mr
   Bukhari placed reliance in submissions as showing the need for a
   balancing exercise to be carried out.  That case was a judicial review
   challenge to a refusal of indefinite leave to remain based on paragraph
   322(5) of the Rules.  Whilst I accept that paragraph 322(5) is concerned
   with the undesirability of allowing a person to remain in the UK, the
   Judge's consideration is in the context of whether a person should be
   granted settlement and turns on the Respondent's policy and Rules in that
   regard and the position of a person who had resided lawfully in the UK
   for a lengthy period.  Furthermore, Ngouh is an unusual case on its
   facts.  As is said at  [121] of the judgment, reliance on the convictions
   had to be looked at in the context of those facts and it is that exercise
   which the Respondent had failed to conduct.  As this was a judicial
   review, the Judge quashed the decision under challenge for that reason
   and required the Respondent to reconsider.  The context is for those
   reasons entirely different.

18. However, the Judge in this case has erred in wrongly assuming that the
   burden was on the Appellant to show that the convictions did not mean
   that his presence was not conducive.  The Judge had to consider for
   herself whether the convictions meant that the Appellant's presence was
   not conducive.  The issue was not whether the Respondent's conclusion in
   that regard was reasonable.  I accept that there was evidence in the form
   of the convictions on which the Judge could rely in endorsing the
   Respondent's view even though the Respondent's reasoning is not set out
   in the decision letter.  However, and although the Judge has provided
   some reasons why it might be said that the Appellant's presence is not
   conducive, notwithstanding the passage of time since the convictions, I
   am satisfied that the Judge has misdirected herself both in relation to
   the relevant burden of proof and has also erred by failing to determine
   the suitability issue for herself.

19. However, as I noted in the course of Mr Bukhari's submissions my
   conclusion on the first ground is not necessarily the end of the matter.
   I have to consider whether the error makes any difference.  As I have
   noted at [5] above, the Respondent also refused the Appellant's claim on
   the basis that he could not meet the Rules.  That was because, in
   relation to the Appellant's family life, the Respondent concluded that
   EX.1 was not met and, in relation to the Appellant's private life,
   because the Appellant had not shown that there were very significant
   obstacles to his integration in Pakistan and therefore could not meet
   Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).  It is therefore necessary for me to examine the
   Decision in the context of the remaining grounds in order to decide
   whether the error established by ground one makes any difference to the
   outcome.

Ground Five: Burden of Proof

20. I begin my consideration of the remaining grounds with ground five as,
   if the Judge has wrongly directed herself in relation to the burden of
   proof (other than in relation to suitability already dealt with) that
   would have an impact on the Judge's findings on other aspects of the
   Appellant's case.


21. At [13] of the Decision, the Judge states that the burden is on the
   Appellant to the standard of the balance of probabilities.  Whilst that
   may be a somewhat simplistic statement of where the burden lies in an
   Article 8 ECHR case, it is not incorrect as a statement of the need for
   an appellant to establish the facts and strength of his family and
   private life with which removal will interfere and the level and nature
   of the interference.  It is of course for the Respondent to justify the
   necessity for and proportionality of removal based on her view of the
   public interest.  However, that exercise in immigration cases at least is
   simplified by consideration of the interference through the lens of the
   Rules and Section 117B Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


22. Turning then to the paragraph of the Decision which is criticised in
   the Appellant's grounds that reads as follows:


         "48. I re-iterate that I have reached this decision as there is an
         evidential burden on the Appellant which has simply not been
         discharged.  If the Appellant, Sponsor and Sponsor's mother in law
         are receiving the treatment that they have stated in oral evidence,
         then it is for them to prove this and this evidence within the UK
         would be readily available for the GP and consultant providing
         treatment.  I do not accept oral evidence where it would have been
         straightforward to provide documentary evidence.  However, there is
         not even an Appellant's bundle before me and much of the evidence
         contained in the Respondent's bundle is so old as to be of little
         evidential value."


23. The Appellant's grounds in this regard are a little difficult to
   follow.  For that reason, I set out the relevant paragraph of the grounds
   criticising [48] of the Decision as follows:


         "12. Finally, in Para 48 the IJ lets out that she does not fully
         understand the job at hand when she claims that the Appellant had
         an evidential burden to discharge which he did not.  The failure of
         the IJ to appreciate that the Appellant had the legal burden
         throughout amounts to a gross error of law because it would render
         the treatment of any evidence unreliable, and the Determination
         unsafe.  It is in furtherance of such confusion that it is also
         difficult to reconcile that the IJ states that there was no Appeal
         bundle whilst simultaneously talking about witness statements and
         expert reports and that she rejected all oral evidence, not because
         it was unreliable or because it was not credible, but simply
         because documentary evidence instead had not been given.  Such is
         not what is expected in a properly reasoned Determination, and such
         treatment of the appeal amounts to an error of law."


24. I accept what is said in the Respondent's written submissions dated 4
   August 2020 at [12] that the Judge at [48] of the Decision is not
   intending to refer to "evidential" as a term of art.  The Judge is simply
   saying that the Appellant has failed to discharge his burden as set out
   at [13] of the Decision.  It is in any event difficult to discern what is
   the Appellant's complaint about the terminology as [12] of the grounds
   appears to accept that he bears the burden.  If anything, a legal burden
   is a more formidable threshold to surmount.


25. I accept that there is what I have assumed to be an Appellant's bundle
   albeit, as I have already indicated, it is not indexed or paginated and
   there is no covering letter identifying it as such.  It is not clear on
   its face that it is a bundle filed by the Appellant in this appeal.
   Indeed, many if not most of the documents in what I understand to be the
   Appellant's bundle are simply copies of what was before the Respondent as
   is evident from the dates (the witness statements for example date from
   September 2019 which is when the application was made to the Respondent).
    In any event, nothing turns on the Judge's reference to the lack of an
   Appellant's bundle.  There is no suggestion in the grounds that the Judge
   failed to deal with any of this evidence.  The complaint is the way in
   which the Judge has dealt with the evidence.


26. What is said at [48] of the Decision also has to be looked at in its
   context.  This is the final paragraph of the Decision and comes after the
   Judge's consideration of the material evidence.  The focus of what is
   said at [48] of the Decision is the medical conditions of the Appellant,
   the Sponsor and the Sponsor's mother.  The Judge is not requiring
   documentary evidence in support of all the oral evidence.  She is simply
   making the point that it is for the Appellant to show that he, his wife
   and his mother-in-law suffer from the conditions asserted, are receiving
   the treatment they say they are receiving and could not receive that
   treatment in Pakistan (or in the case of the Appellant's mother-in-law
   could not remain in the UK without the care of the Appellant and the
   Sponsor).


27. The Judge was entitled to take into account the lack of documentary and
   up-to-date evidence in relation to medical conditions and treatment.  She
   did not wrongly place the burden on the Appellant to make out his case
   about the existence of those conditions and need for treatment or
   alternative care.  The requirement is rightly placed on him to evidence
   those facts. Ground five does not disclose any error of law.

Grounds Two to Four: Obstacles to Relocation to Pakistan

28. There is a degree of overlap in the Decision between obstacles to the
   Appellant's integration in Pakistan and continuation of family life in
   that country.  The main part of the Appellant's case is that he and the
   Sponsor could not continue their family life in Pakistan. However, some
   of the reasons given for that inability also potentially impact on the
   Appellant's ability to integrate. The criticisms in the grounds are
   therefore relevant to both the Judge's consideration of EX.1 and
   paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules.

29. Before I turn to the factors relied on and the criticisms made of the
   Judge's reasoning, it is necessary for me to say a little more about the
   Judge's approach to these issues in the context of the error which I have
   found to be established by ground one.


30. In particular, Mr Bukhari submitted that the error in relation to
   suitability will have infected the whole of the Decision because the
   Judge will have had this in mind when dealing with the other aspects.  I
   do not accept that submission for the following reasons.


31. First, the Judge, having reached the conclusion about suitability at
   [23] of the Decision went on to say the following:


         "24. I go on to consider the insurmountable obstacles test in EX.1.
         since I have concluded that the Respondent's decision to refuse the
         Appellant in respect of his character conduct and associations is
         the correct decision, the Appellant cannot succeed under the
         Immigration Rules, however for completeness I consider EX.1. and
         EX.2. of the Immigration Rules."


32. As the Judge rightly says, if the Appellant fails on suitability
   grounds, he is unable to meet the Rules.  The Judge therefore goes on to
   consider whether he meets the other aspects of the Rules "for
   completeness" but also leaving out of account her conclusions as to
   suitability.


33. Although I accept that the Judge, at [45] of the Decision when
   considering Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) does mention the likelihood of the
   Appellant failing on suitability grounds, she goes on to state that
   "[o]therwise, as indicated above" she does not find the Appellant case in
   that regard to be made out (my emphasis).  In other words, the Judge has
   considered that part of the case also in the alternative as if
   suitability were not at issue.



34. Second, and linked to this point, the issue whether the Appellant meets
   the Rules under EX.1. or Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) depends on the Appellant
   establishing on the evidence that he meets specified thresholds.  There
   is no balancing assessment to be carried out at that stage between
   interference and the public interest.


35. Third, if the Judge had found those thresholds to be met (or either of
   them), then the Appellant could contend that the error made in relation
   to suitability made a difference to the outcome (and I would undoubtedly
   have accepted that redetermination of the appeal was required).  However,
   the Judge concluded that the thresholds were not met.  For those reasons,
   if the Judge's findings on EX.1. and Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) are sound,
   then the appeal fails under the Rules irrespective of any finding in
   relation to suitability.


36. Fourth, although it might be said that the finding on suitability is
   capable of influencing the Judge's assessment outside the Rules, when the
   Judge goes on to carry out that assessment (at [46] to [47] of the
   Decision), the Judge makes no mention whatsoever of either suitability or
   even the criminal convictions.


37. Grounds two to four all concern the Judge's findings under the Rules,
   in particular in relation to EX.1, as to the obstacles to family life on
   return to Pakistan and I have therefore grouped them together under the
   one heading when considering the criticisms made.


38. I begin with the criticisms made of the Judge's consideration of the
   medical conditions of the Appellant, the Sponsor and the Sponsor's
   mother.


39. The Judge deals with the documentary and other evidence relating to the
   Appellant's and Sponsor's mental health at [25] to [36] of the Decision
   as follows:


         "25. The Appellant provides a psychological report of Dr Salma
         Latif.  The report is based on an interview that took place with
         the Appellant on 20th March 2019 and 'Medical records of Mrs Khan'.
         26.  Dr Latif describes having seen a 'Community Log Sewa' dated
         19th May 2014 confirming the Sponsor's long history of mental
         health difficulties from 2008 stating she has deliberately self-
         harmed in the past, cuts herself and has a history of agoraphobia,
         severe panic attacks and anxiety attacks.
         27.  Dr Latif also describes evidence from 2017 and 2018 which
         states that the Sponsor has had five miscarriages and is keen to be
         referred for private fertility treatment.
         28.  Dr Latif concludes that removing the Appellant to Pakistan
         could exacerbate the Appellant's and the Sponsor's mental health
         conditions.
         29.  I do find that Dr Latif is an appropriately qualified medical
         practitioner, however I find the evidence relied upon by Dr Latif
         to be scant and I find it hard to see how Dr Latif could conclude
         as she did with sight of such little evidence, with evidence of
         mental health problems dated some five years previously, and having
         seemingly not even have met [sic] the Sponsor.  I find that the
         conclusions reached could not possibly have been reached on the
         basis of the evidence that Dr Latif has seen.  If she has had
         greater evidence before her, it is not recorded in the report.
         30.  In respect of the Sponsor's health, there is a letter before
         me dated 27 December 2012 in respect of miscarriages the Sponsor
         had suffered from and a letter from 14th April 2014 which describes
         high levels of anxiety experienced by the Sponsor.
         31.  In respect of the medical difficulties of the Appellant, I
         have before me prescriptions from 27.11.2018 for Zopiclone (a
         sleeping tablet) and appointments for psychological appointments,
         albeit with no evidence of what occurred at those appointments or
         further recommendations for treatment.
         32.  In respect of the Sponsor's mother in law [sic] there is
         medical evidence (GP records) from March 2013 to February 2014 and
         a letter from 18 September 2016 which states that the Sponsor's
         mother suffers from Type 2 diabetes, previous stroke, depression
         and anxiety, recent diagnosis of pneumonia and asthma.
         33.  All of the evidence before me is worryingly out of date, with
         the exception of the psychological report where I have reservations
         about the out of date material reviewed by Dr Latif in terms of the
         weight I attach to this evidence.
         34.  I can attach little weight to any of the medical evidence
         before me for either the Sponsor, her mother in law [sic] or the
         Appellant.  The evidence is out of date and therefore cannot be
         relied upon for a review of the current position.
         35.  I note that the Sponsor at the hearing appeared anxious, but I
         have little evidence of value on which I can make a finding on as
         to the impact on the sponsor or the Appellant of the Appellant's
         removal to Pakistan.
         36.  I have considered the oral evidence of the Appellant and
         Sponsor.  The Sponsor stated that she was reliant on the Appellant
         and that she could sometimes not get out of bed.  In these
         circumstances she relied on the Appellant to her help her [sic].
         The Sponsor also referred to the Appellant assisting her mother in
         law [sic] by talking to her."


40. The Appellant's primary criticism concerns the report of Dr Latif ("the
   Expert Report").  It is suggested that there is a contradiction between
   the Judge's finding that Dr Latif is a suitably qualified practitioner
   and her conclusion that she cannot give weight to the report because Dr
   Latif has not shown how her opinion is reached.  It is said that Dr Latif
   has said that she formed her opinion based on an interview with the
   Appellant and the Sponsor.  The Appellant submits that the Judge must
   either have found that Dr Latif was incompetent or that she was biased.
   If not, then the Appellant says that "it is not the IJ's place to
   challenge a suitably prepared report of a suitably qualified medical
   practitioner that has never been challenged by the Respondent."


41. The Appellant's grounds take the Judge's comments out of context.  In
   order to understand the Judge's conclusions and why she gave little
   weight to the Expert Report, it is necessary to look at what is said
   about that report against the report itself.


42. The Expert Report appears at [RB/K].  It is dated 20 April 2019.  The
   nature of the Expert Report is said to be a "[r]eport detailing care
   provided to partner suffering form [sic] mental health difficulties and
   extenuating circumstances as to why Mr Muhammad Khan should remain in the
   UK".


43. As the Judge accepts, Dr Latif has appropriate qualifications as a
   psychologist although not as a psychiatrist.   That may explain why she
   does not deal in the Expert Report with a diagnostic assessment of the
   Appellant's physical symptoms.  She could not of course assess the
   Sponsor's symptoms in any event as she did not see the Sponsor.



44. The sources of information and documents relied upon are set out at
   [5.1] of the Expert Report as follows:


         "A psychological assessment of Mr Khan was undertaken on the 20th
         March 2019 at a meeting room in Cheadle House.  Mr Khan is able to
         speak English with fluency and the assessment was undertaken in
         English.  Mr Khan fully understood that the assessment was being
         carried out on the basis that a psychological report would be
         compiled and detail his present mental health functioning and also
         his wife's difficulties.  Mr Khan provided his verbal consent to
         being interviewed for the psychological assessment and for the
         writing of this subsequent report."


   It is not said for how long the meeting lasted.  The Expert Report goes
   on to record that Dr Latif saw the medical records for the Sponsor.
   There is no mention of having viewed the Appellant's medical records.


45. Having recorded the Appellant's account of his past personal and
   medical history, Dr Latif sets out the following concerning the mental
   health of the Sponsor:


         "..7.6   A letter from Community Logg Sewa (dated 19th May 2014)
         confirms that Mrs Khan has a history of mental health difficulties
         from 2008 and deliberately self-harmed in the past and cuts herself
         on a regular basis, has a history of Agoraphobia and severe panic
         and anxiety attacks and has been seen by a Consultant Psychiatrist
         in the past and has also been diagnosed with somatic symptoms."


   Other than what the Appellant told Dr Latif about his wife's depression
   (which is in the form of bare assertions), that is the sum total of the
   evidence about the Sponsor on which Dr Latif relied.


46. In relation to the Appellant's own mental health, Dr Latif sets out at
   [8.0] of the Expert Report the symptoms which the Appellant claims to
   suffer - that he is unable to sleep and has been prescribed medication to
   help him sleep, that he has a loss of appetite and has lost weight, that
   he is unable to concentrate and becomes frustrated and feels worried due
   to his immigration status.  It is also said that he has ongoing suicidal
   ideation, but he has never attempted suicide as the Sponsor is a
   protective factor.  As I have pointed out, Dr Latif did not apparently
   have the Appellant's medical notes to confirm his report and nor is she a
   psychiatrist who would have carried out an assessment of his symptoms
   based on diagnostic criteria.


47. Instead, based on the Appellant's self-reporting, Dr Latif concludes as
   follows:


         "9.0 CONCLUSION
           i) The likely psychological impact and the possible consequences
              that Mr Khan and his wife would face on Mr Khan's deportation
              to Pakistan;
              Mr Khan and his wife Mrs Khan have experienced considerable
              difficulty and traumatizing experiences within their past
              nine years of marriage.  [Dr Latif then summarises the
              history of problems with conception].  She also has a
              diagnosis of Diabetes and long history of self-harm and
              depression.  Mr Khan is at present taking anti-depressant
              medication.  He is receiving therapy at present.  Given Ms
              Khan's traumatic failed pregnancies and her failed physical
              and mental health, as well as her husband's ongoing
              immigration predicament, she is completely dependent upon her
              husband for emotional and practical support and if Mr Khan
              was to leave and be forcibly returned to Pakistan, if Mrs
              Khan was requested to severe [sic] ties with her family and
              be forced to leave with him to keep their marriage together,
              then this would cause her to put her own health at risk,
              given her physical and mental health difficulties.
          ii) The likely difficulties along with its psychological impact
              Mr Khan would face in his reintegration in Pakistan;
              In my professional opinion, if Mr Khan is returned to
              Pakistan forcibly, his wife is likely to experience a
              deterioration in her depressive state, because he emotionally
              and practically supports her.  She also has a history of self-
              harm and the impact of his departure may increase the risk of
              further self-harm.
              At present Mr Khan is taking anti-depressants and is
              undergoing therapy as a result of the time he spent in
              custody and because of his wife's miscarriages and his own
              immigration predicament.  He is likely due to his own failing
              mental health experience difficulty in reintegrating back
              into Pakistan after at least 12 years.  His poor mental
              health would also cause him difficulty in securing
              employment.
         iii) Any other related matters as you see fit.
              Mr Khan will be separated from his wife who is emotionally
              and practically dependent on him and without his support it
              is likely that Mrs Khan's mental health will deteriorate
              further given her long history of depression and self-harm.
              Mrs Khan has a poor state of mental health and at present
              requires a supportive environment.  Her main source of
              support is Mr Khan and if he is removed from the UK, on
              balance in my opinion, the mental health of Mrs Khan will
              further deteriorate."


48. Dealing first with the Sponsor's mental health, as I have already
   recorded, Dr Latif did not meet her.  She has relied wholly on the
   Sponsor's medical notes and the brief comments recorded about what the
   Appellant said were her problems.  The only reference to the Sponsor's
   medical notes is the passage I have set out at [45] above.  That is a
   reference to a letter dated some five years prior to the Expert Report.
   Although that letter appears to refer to ongoing problems since 2008, the
   letter is historic.  That is clearly something to which the Judge has had
   and was entitled to have regard. It was not possible for the Judge to
   assess whether those problems continued because, as she comments at [34]
   of the Decision, the evidence was "out of date".  There is another letter
   in the bundle dated 14 April 2014 but, as the Judge said, it could not be
   relied upon to show the present position.  It is notable that the
   Sponsor's witness statement makes no mention at all of mental health
   problems either in the past or currently.  That was something to which
   the Judge was entitled to have regard.  She has recorded some oral
   evidence from the Sponsor at [36] of the Decision, but that has to be
   contrasted with the omission in the written statement.


49. Turning then to the Appellant's mental health, probably as a result of
   Dr Latif's qualification as a psychologist and not a psychiatrist, there
   is no diagnosis of mental illness based on physical symptoms.  Dr Latif
   has relied wholly on what she was told by the Appellant.  There is no
   reference to her having had the Appellant's medical notes.


50. There is other medical evidence in the Respondent's bundle relating to
   the Appellant.  There is a prescription for Zopiclone dated 27 November
   2018.  Zopiclone is a sleeping pill (as confirmed by the Appellant
   recorded at [8.2] of the Expert Report).  There is no reference in the
   Expert Report that I can see to the Appellant being prescribed any other
   medication.  There is reference in a subsequent letter dated 21 April
   2019 from Dr Latif to the immigration authorities (seeking a change in
   his immigration reporting requirements) to the Appellant taking
   Citalopram which is an anti-depressant.  There is however no mention of
   this in the Expert Report and it is not therefore clear from where Dr
   Latif has taken the information in her conclusion that the Appellant is
   prescribed anti-depressants.

51. Similarly, Dr Latif says in her conclusions that the Appellant is
   receiving therapy for his mental health.    There is no reference to this
   in the Appellant's account to Dr Latif of his medical history or
   symptoms. There is some supportive evidence in the bundle to an "initial
   assessment appointment" with "Let's Talk-Wellbeing" (part of the
   Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust) which was arranged for 6
   December 2018.  It appears that the Appellant attended that appointment
   and was "to be offered step 2 Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for stress
   management".   A further appointment was arranged on 18 January 2019.  It
   is not clear whether the Appellant attended.  A letter from the
   organisation dated 29 March 2019 states that the Appellant did not attend
   his appointment on that day, and another was arranged on 12 April 2019.
   Thereafter the evidential trail goes cold.  The hearing before Judge
   Howorth was on 24 January 2020 (there is a typographical error in the
   Decision in this regard).  There was therefore a period of nine months at
   least where there was no evidence as to the position.

52. As with the Sponsor, there is no mention of the Appellant's mental
   health problems in his witness statement.  There is no mention in either
   the Appellant's or the Sponsor's witness statements of the mental health
   problems of the other partner.


53. Contrary to the submission in the Appellant's grounds, it is for a
   Judge to decide what weight can be accorded to evidence provided he/she
   does so on a rational basis and provides reasons.  That includes the
   evidence of experts.  In this regard, there is a distinction to be drawn
   between an expert having the necessary expertise and the relevance and
   strength of the content of his/her report.  Here, the Judge accepted that
   Dr Latif had relevant expertise.  However, she could give less weight to
   Dr Latif's report due to the doctor's failure to show how she had reached
   her conclusions.  That was particularly so in relation to the Sponsor
   where Dr Latif has relied on evidence pre-dating the Expert Report by
   some five years to reach a conclusion as to the Sponsor's current mental
   health without even meeting the Sponsor.  It is difficult to see on what
   she has based her assessment as to the Sponsor's current mental health
   problems let alone what might occur if the Sponsor were to leave the UK
   with the Appellant or remain in the UK without him.

54. There is perhaps a little more evidence on which Dr Latif could base
   her assessment of the Appellant.  She did not however have his medical
   notes and has relied, it appears, wholly on what she was told by the
   Appellant about his problems.  I have already pointed to certain
   discrepancies between, for example, the evidence which the Judge had
   about his medication and what Dr Latif said he was prescribed.

55. The Judge had to base her assessment of the Appellant's and Sponsor's
   mental health problems on all the evidence.  She was entitled to draw
   attention to the historic nature of the medical evidence and lack of up-
   to-date documentary evidence to show what are the problems.  I have
   already noted the lack of any mention of the mental health conditions in
   the Appellant's and Sponsor's witness statements.  The Judge has had
   regard to their oral evidence in this regard at [36] of the Decision.


56. The Judge has had regard to the other evidence, in particular as to
   prescription of medication for mental health problems at [31] of the
   Decision.  Her comments in that paragraph and at [41] of the Decision are
   criticised as "unfortunate" for having reduced the Appellant's and
   Sponsor's problems to mere provision of sleeping tablets which are
   available in Pakistan.  The Judge says as follows at [41]:


         "The Appellant according to the evidence has a degree in
         engineering from Pakistan.  He has lived most of his life in
         Pakistan, I find that he could return and set up again ion
         Pakistan.  The evidence before me in respect of medical problems
         indicates that the Appellant may have some psychological
         difficulties, as may the Sponsor, as I have indicated the evidence
         before [me] is poor and not up to date.  The Appellant could
         continue to receive sleeping tablets in Pakistan and this is the
         only evidence available to me at present of medication he is in
         receipt of.  There is no up to date evidence of the Sponsor's
         medication."


57. When [31] and [41] of the Decision are read together and with the rest
   of the Judge's findings about the Appellant's and Sponsor's mental
   health, having regard also to what I have said about the totality of the
   evidence, there is and can be no error of law.  The Judge has faithfully
   recorded the evidence she had.  She has taken into account the oral
   evidence (in spite of the failure to mention any of these problems in
   written statements).  She was entitled to reach the conclusion she did
   about this evidence.  There is no "downplaying" of what that evidence
   shows.


58. The second criticism made and which is the subject of ground three
   concerns the Judge's finding about alternative care available to the
   Appellant's mother-in-law in the UK.  The relevant paragraphs of the
   Decision (which cross over with what is said about the Appellant's and
   Sponsor's own mental health and therefore begin at [36] cited above) read
   as follows:


         "37. However, the presence of the sister in the family home with
         the Appellant, Sponsor and Sponsor's mother was omitted in written
         statements and it must be the case that the Sponsor's sister also
         assists in caring for the family.  There is no statement of the
         Sponsor's sister before me and she did not attend court.  This
         makes it difficult to find that the Sponsor's mother could not be
         cared for, if indeed she requires care as there is no current
         evidence of this before me, by the Sponsor's sister.
         38.  I also find that the omission of reference to the Sponsor's
         sister living with the Sponsor's family rather tarnishes the
         evidence of the Appellant and Sponsor.  It appears that her
         presence was deliberately omitted from the written evidence and
         only became apparent in cross examination.  It was also stated in
         oral evidence that the Sponsor's sister was caring for her mother
         on the day of the hearing which also diminishes claims that she
         couldn't care for her if the Sponsor left the UK."


59. The first point to make about this passage is that, as with the
   evidence about the Appellant's and Sponsor's mental health, the evidence
   about the sister emerged only in oral evidence and is not covered in the
   written statements. There is mention of a brother in the Sponsor's
   witness statement but no mention of a sister.  It is not suggested in the
   grounds of appeal that the Judge has misunderstood the evidence.
   Although paragraph 9 of the grounds refers to "a hidden sponsor's sister
   at home", that paragraph goes on to refer to the lack of evidence from
   "the sister in question".  It appears therefore to be accepted that there
   is indeed a sister who lives in the UK.  Indeed, that appears confirmed
   by the penultimate sentence of the paragraph which states that "[t]he
   only evidence if it can be called that, was that the sister was with the
   mother at home for the few hours that the appellant and the Sponsor were
   in court".  Mr Bukhari accepted that the Sponsor does have a sister in
   the UK.  The grounds do not however provide any further detail about the
   whereabouts of that sister.  When I asked Mr Bukhari about this and
   whether she lived with the Sponsor and her mother, he said that "she
   comes and goes but does not live in the same house".  As I have already
   noted, coming back to the written evidence, there is mention in the
   Sponsor's witness statement to a brother who used to assist his mother
   but it is said that "for the past three years he was no longer available
   to assist her".  It is not said why he is no longer able to help.  There
   is no evidence from this brother.


60. The issues in this regard were, first, the need for the Sponsor's
   mother to have care and, second, whether that care would be available
   from elsewhere.  Dealing with the second issue first, the fact of other
   family members being available and able to assist was clearly relevant.
   The Judge was entitled to have regard to the lack of evidence from those
   other family members and to draw inferences from that omission.  I do not
   have any record of proceedings to check the extent of what was said in
   evidence about the sister but, at the very least, based on the evidence
   which is accepted as having been given in the grounds, the Judge was
   entitled to find that there was a sister who could help out.

61. That brings me on to the first issue, namely whether the Sponsor's
   mother needs care and the extent of her caring needs.  That is part of
   the Judge's consideration at [37] of the Decision.


62. The written statements of the Appellant and Sponsor point to a stroke
   which the Sponsor's mother suffered in 2015.  It is said that she is "old
   and frail" and that "she has been incapable to conducting [sic] day to
   day normal activities on her own.  She needs regular physical support in
   terms of eating, bathing and other essential health needs." It is said
   that the Sponsor "always hold her to walk around or to go for medical
   checkups and so on".  The statements were made in September 2019.


63. There is a letter from the Sponsor's mother dated 13 September 2019 at
   [RB/F] which similarly refers to having suffered a serious stroke and
   being unable since "to function without physical support".  She says that
   she does "not think that [she] could be alive for even a week as [she]
   could not wash, cook, eat or even walk without physical support and [the
   Sponsor] has been the only one caring for [her]."  She too mentions the
   Sponsor's brother but says that "since his father passed away he no
   longer comes near [her]".  There is no reason provided why that should be
   so.


64. I turn to the independent, documentary medical evidence about the
   Sponsor's mother's health and caring needs.  This consists of the
   following (at RB/C and in the loose bundle):


   a) Letters dated 5 January 2018 and 12 September 2019 from Leicester
      General Hospital referring to admissions for an endoscopy.  There is
      no evidence about the reason for that procedure nor any information
      about the outcome.
   b) Letter dated 30 November 2017 from a Consultant General and Colorectal
      Surgeon, Mr Sangal.  He confirms seeing the Sponsor's mother (then
      aged 65 years) on 22 November 2017.  The letter confirms that the
      mother's daughter (presumably the Sponsor) attended with her mother.
      There is a suggestion of the need for a colonoscopy but the Sponsor's
      mother was said not to want one.  There is a possible diagnosis of
      coeliac disease but no further information about that.  It appears
      that the Sponsor's mother was already having endoscopies at that time.
      She was on a gluten free diet.
   c) Notification of an appointment on 7 April 2017 with the respiratory
      medicine department.  It is not said what this is for nor is there any
      information as to outcome.
   d) Letter dated 18 September 2016 from the Sponsor's mother's GP.  She is
      said at that time to suffer from type 2 diabetes, "previous stroke",
      depression and anxiety and "recent diagnosis of pneumonia and asthma".
       It appears from what is there said that the appointment in April 2017
      related to that latter condition.
   e) Patient records from March 2013 to March 2014.  These confirm a stroke
      in 2013 (and not 2015 as stated in the Appellant's and Sponsor's
      statements although I accept that she may have had more than one
      stroke).   In April 2013, her older daughter (I assume the Sponsor) is
      said to suffer from depression and anxiety, her son is said to suffer
      from social anxiety and agoraphobia (as a result of which he does not
      leave the house) and her youngest daughter is said to be recently
      divorced and therefore "feeling down".  There is reference to general
      check-ups, a chest infection in May 2013 and back pain in June 2013
      and subsequently.  The records refer to onset of diabetes in January
      2014.
   f) There is an extract from what appears to be a disability allowance
      care form dating 5 December 2013 which refers to physiotherapy for
      back problems and various medications for other problems.  There is no
      evidence about outcome.
   g) Letter (undated) from Stroke Association setting out the service
      provided.  There is no evidence about take up of the offer of support
      nor when this service was offered.


65. There is also evidence in the bundle about personal independence
   payments. However, first, this is historic (dating back to 2016) and,
   second, it appears to relate to payments made to the Sponsor and not her
   mother.  It is not clear therefore whether the documents relating to
   carers allowance given, it appears, to the Appellant, relates to care of
   his mother-in-law or the Sponsor.  However, a letter dated 23 February
   2015 appears to suggest the latter as it refers to the Sponsor not
   getting disability benefit from February to March 2015 and to the
   Appellant not therefore being entitled to carers allowance for that
   period.


66. As the Judge rightly points out, none of this evidence shows the
   Sponsor's mother's need for care.  The medical records do not go up to
   the date when the Appellant and Sponsor say that she suffered the serious
   stroke.  There is no independent medical evidence confirming that she
   suffered that stroke nor the level of incapacity as a result.  The
   evidence there is about the Sponsor's mother's health is largely historic
   (as the Judge observed) but, as the Judge also observed, does not provide
   evidence of the need for any personal care let alone to the level
   asserted in the statements.


67. Whether or not the Judge has speculated about the availability of care
   from the Sponsor's sister is therefore irrelevant.  As I have already
   observed, however, the Judge was entitled to draw inferences from the
   lack of evidence about the position both of this sister and of the
   Sponsor's brother. The Judge was therefore entitled to conclude as she
   did at [42] of the Decision that "the Sponsor's mother could be cared for
   by the Appellant's sister who resides with the Sponsor's mother, if
   indeed she requires care" (my emphasis).


68. Moving then finally to ground four, this concerns the Sponsor's ability
   to speak the languages spoken in Pakistan.  This is dealt with by the
   Judge at [43] of the Decision as follows:


         "I also find that the Sponsor speaks languages of Pakistan, as her
         parents relocated to the UK from Pakistan and it is likely that she
         communicated with them [in] Pakistani languages.  I do however find
         that it is also likely that the Sponsor has been truthful that she
         cannot write in any Pakistani language".


69. As with the other written evidence to which I have referred, the
   statements of the Sponsor and Appellant contain no more than bare
   assertions that the Sponsor does not speak or write any of the languages
   in Pakistan.  There is however other evidence that the Sponsor's mother
   speaks Urdu as her main language (see for example entry dated 28 August
   2013 in the medical records).  Although the Sponsor came to the UK at a
   young age, the Judge was entitled to draw inferences from the fact that
   her parents will have spoken the languages used in Pakistan which is
   confirmed by the evidence.  This is not impermissible speculation.


70. As Mr Melvin pointed out, to establish that the Decision is Wednesbury
   unreasonable or perverse the Appellant would have to show that the
   Decision is one which a Judge properly directed could not have reached on
   the evidence.  It is a high threshold.  Leaving out of account the
   suitability findings, the Judge has taken into account all relevant
   evidence and has made findings open to her on that evidence for the
   reasons she has given which are adequate.  She was entitled to reach the
   conclusions she did regarding EX.1. and Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) and on
   the proportionality of removal.  As I have concluded for the reasons
   given at [30] to [36] above, the Judge has reached those conclusions
   without regard to her findings about suitability and on the assumption
   that the Appellant would not fail for suitability reasons.


71. I therefore conclude that there is no error in relation to the Judge's
   findings about the obstacles to family life being continued in Pakistan.
   The Judge was entitled to conclude on the evidence that the obstacles
   asserted did not, for the reasons given, amount to insurmountable
   obstacles.  The Judge was entitled to find that there would be no very
   significant obstacles to integration in Pakistan and therefore that
   Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) was not met.  For that reason, the Judge was
   entitled to conclude that the Appellant could not satisfy the Rules even
   if the suitability requirement was met.  She was entitled to conclude
   that the Appellant's human rights would not be breached by removal.


72. For those reasons, the Judge's error in relation to the finding
   concerning the suitability requirement makes no difference to the
   outcome.  Based on the Judge's assessment of the Appellant's inability to
   meet the other requirement of the Rules based on his family and private
   life, she was entitled to conclude that he would not be able to satisfy
   the Rules in any event.  She was entitled to take that into account when
   considered whether Article 8 would be breached by removal.  She has not
   taken into account her findings relating to suitability (or even the
   criminal convictions) when carrying out her proportionality assessment.
   She was therefore entitled to dismiss the appeal on the basis that
   Article 8 ECHR would not be breached.  For that reason, although there is
   an error of law in the Decision, I decline to set aside the Decision.  I
   therefore maintain the Decision.

CONCLUSION

73. For the foregoing reasons, although I accept that there is an error of
   law disclosed by the first ground, I am satisfied that it is not one
   which affects the outcome.  Accordingly, I decline to set aside the
   Decision.   I therefore uphold the Decision with the result that the
   Appellant's appeal remains dismissed.


DECISION
The Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Howorth promulgated on 7 February
2020 involves the making of an error on a point of law but that error is
not one which affects the outcome.  I therefore uphold the Decision.
