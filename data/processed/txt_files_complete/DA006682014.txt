For the Respondent:    Mr D Byrne, Advocate, instructed by Drummond Miller,

      Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as described above, but are referred to in the rest  of
    this determination as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The SSHD appeals against a determination by Judge J  C  Grant-Hutchison
    and Dr C J  Winstanley,  promulgated  on  3  July  2014,  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  dismissing  it  on
    humanitarian protection grounds, and allowing  it  [alternatively?]  on
    human rights grounds under Article 8.



 3. The grounds of appeal run as follows:

    1.           Making a  material  misdirection  of  law  -  'Immigration
Rules'

           a)    The FTJ  concludes  that  there  are  compelling  reasons,
                 outside of the Immigration Rules, to warrant  allowing  the
                 appellant's appeals [�29].  These matters appear to be  the
                 appellant's children and the present country  situation  in
                 Iraq [�43].

           b)    ... The FTJ has failed to lawfully engage with the correct
                 assessment of the exceptional factors in the instant [case]
                 and has made an error in law as a result.

           c)    The FTJ concludes that returning the  appellant,  and  his
                 family, to Iraq would amount to 'serious  interference'  in
                 the way they enjoy their family  life  together.   The  FTJ
                 fails to make findings of fact as to  whether  there  is  a
                 real risk to the appellant and his family  and  why,  above
                 others, there is a specific risk to this family.   The  FTJ
                 describes the situation as fluid and concludes that  it  is
                 'difficult to speculate as to what may, or may not, happen'
                 [�42].  As such, it is unclear why the FTJ then  speculates
                 that  the  worst  will  occur  and  that   this   precludes
                 deportation of the appellant and his family.

           d)     ...  the  findings  under  the  Immigration   Rules   are
      fundamentally flawed.

      2.         Making a material misdirection of law - 'Article 8'

           a)    In the alternative, the FTJ finds that the appeal fell  to
                 be allowed on Article  8  grounds  owing  to  the  arguable
                 special case relied upon under the Rules [�44].   As  such,
                 it  is  submitted  that  the  findings  on  Article  8  are
                 fundamentally infected by the  flawed  findings  under  the
                 Rules.

           b)    However, in the alternative  the  SSHD  submits  that  the
                 appellant's Article 8 claim is not sufficient  to  outweigh
                 deportation.   The  FTJ  relies  on  the  facts  that   the
                 appellant has 'not committed any further crimes'  and  that
                 he is now older, a  family  man  and  very  sorry  for  his
                 earlier conduct.  The FTJ accept this evidence and conclude
                 that there is 'no evidence produced by  the  respondent  to
                 show that the general public are at risk in the future from
                 this appellant'.

           c)    The SSHD contends that the FTJ's assessment of the  public
                 interest is unlawful as it places determinative  weight  on
                 the appellant's risk of offending.  In Gurung v SSHD [2012]
                 EWCA Civ 62 the Court of Appeal held that the absence of  a
                 risk of  reoffending,  though  plainly  important,  is  the
                 "ultimate aim" of the deportation regime;

                       "Given what is now the Borders Act presumption, we do
                       not  consider  that  the  absence   of   a   judicial
                       recommendation for deportation can carry  the  weight
                       accorded to it by the Tribunal n  paragraph  38  (see
                       above).  Nor do we accept (cf paragraph  40(i)  cited
                       above) that the absence of  a  risk  of  reoffending,
                       though plainly important, is the  "ultimate  aim"  of
                       the deportation regime." [�23]

                       We are troubled, too, by the proposition in  #40(iii)
                       cited above) that the nature and seriousness  of  the
                       offence do not  by  themselves  justify  interference
                       with family  and  private  life  without  prospective
                       regard to the public interest.   Although  Mr  Bourne
                       does not seek to characterise this  as  an  error  of
                       law, he is right, in our view,  to  suggest  that  it
                       misplaces the emphasis.   The  Borders  Act  by  s.32
                       decides  that  the  nature  and  seriousness  of  the
                       offence,  as  measured  by  the   sentence,   do   by
                       themselves justify deportation  unless  an  exception
                       recognised by the Act itself applies." [�24]

              d) As such, the SSHD submits that the  FTJ  should  have  been
                 cognisant  to  the  fact  that  deportation  is  not  'one-
                 dimensional' and  that  there  are  other  public  interest
                 factors to consider, including; deterrence (of the offender
                 and others), the expression of societal abhorrence for such
                 conduct and instilling public confidence  in  a  system  of
                 control.

              e) The appellant and his family members are all  nationals  of
                 Iraq ... it is not unreasonable to  expect  them  to  enjoy
                 their family  life  together/establish  comparable  private
                 lives outside the UK.  Article 8 does not confer  a  choice
                 upon the appellant and his family as to  where  they  might
                 wish to enjoy their  family  life,  nor  is  it  a  general
                 dispensing power.

 4. (At 2 (c) I think the SSHD meant to say that the absence of a  risk  of
    reoffending is not the "ultimate aim" of the deportation regime.)

 5. On 23 July 2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Brunnen  granted
    permission to appeal, observing: ...

    2.     The grounds ... submit that the panel ...  failed  correctly  to
           apply the applicable test in relation to  the  appellant's  case
           both  within  and  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.    This  is
           arguable.

    3.     Although the grounds do not take the point, it is arguable  that
           the panel misapprehend the nature of the respondent's  decision;
           contrary to what is said in paragraph 13 of the determination it
           was not an "automatic deportation" decision under the  2007  Act
           but a "conducive" decision under the 1971 Act.  It  is  arguably
           not apparent from the panel's findings in paragraphs 43  and  44
           that the appellant's case was considered with reference  to  the
           requirement in paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules for  there
           to be exceptional circumstances outweighing the public  interest
           in his deportation.

 6. The appellant filed a response in terms of Rule 24:

    1.     The FtT did not materially err in law.  The UT's jurisdiction is
           limited to points of law, not weight or ... re-argument ...

    2.     The grounds of appeal at (d) that the FtT erred in  law  in  its
           assessment of the rules ... [are] immaterial as the  appeal  was
           allowed under Article 8 ECHR.  Ground  2  at  (a)  represents  a
           misreading of paragraph 44 which  does  not  disclose  that  the
           Tribunal relied upon the case under the  Rules  to  justify  the
           case outside them.  In any event, the grounds  do  not  disclose
           why that would be wrong in law where the factual matrix  is  the
           same but the legal tests are different ...  the  FtT  identified
           the correct test and applied [it].  It was for the  Tribunal  to
           apply the correct test to those facts having heard the evidence:
           KBO 2009 CSIH 30 ...

    3.     Ground 2(b) is clearly a disagreement with the findings  of  the
           FtT; "the SSHD submits that the appellant's Article 8  claim  is
           not sufficient to outweigh deportation."   That  ...  is  not  a
           legal complaint or identifies any  legal  ground  disclosing  an
           error of law.   The  grounds  are  inconsistent  with  the  UT's
           jurisdiction  which  is  limited  to  points  of   law   ...   A
           disagreement with weight  is  not  an  error  of  law:  Scottish
           Ministers v Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland  (JMM)  2012  SC
           471, at 21-2 ...

    4.     Ground 2(c) places undue weight on the FtT's  reference  to  the
           appellant's lack of re-offending and changes  in  circumstances;
           these are plainly relevant factors in the Article  8  assessment
           ... the proposition in Gurung is  not  relevant  ...  there  the
           Court stressed that the ultimate  aim  of  deportation  was  not
           solely to prevent re-offending but a risk  of  re-offending  was
           "plainly important".

    5.     Ground 2(d) seeks to reintroduce arguments that  were  not  made
           before the FtT, however the FtT set out the principles in Maslov
           at 27 of the determination ... the respondent fails to  show  in
           what way either the ECtHR got it wrong in Maslov or how the  FtT
           failed to identify and apply the correct test.  Maslov has  been
           relied upon, and not recorded  to  have  been  disputed  by  the
           Secretary of State,  in  JO  (Uganda  and  JT  (Ivory  Coast)  v
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] 1 WLR 1607 (to
           take one example).  Having set out those factors and  identified
           the correct authority it cannot properly be argued that the  FtT
           thought  deportation  was   "one-dimensional".    A   specialist
           tribunal ... is to be assumed  to  understand  the  complex  and
           difficult area of law which it is  charged:  MA  Somalia  [2010]
           UKSC 49 paragraph 43 and AH (Sudan) [2007] UKHL 49; [2008] 1  AC
           678 at paragraph 30.

    6.     Ground 2(e) does not ... articulate a  known  ground  of  appeal
           showing an error of law: Hamden v Secretary  of  State  for  the
           Home Department 2006 CSIH 57, per Lord  Carloway  ...   [passage
           cited on nature of error of law issues].

    7.     Ground 2(e)... is not a ground of appeal but an argument  for  a
           first instance [tribunal].  It falls outwith  this  [tribunal's]
           jurisdiction...

    8.     The grounds insofar as they represent a disagreement, or seek to
           re-argue the case simply go to criticisms  of  weight  which  is
           outside the jurisdiction of this [tribunal] ...

    Decision Granting Leave to Appeal

    9.     The decision of Judge  Brunnen  raises  a  point  that  the  FtT
           arguably misapprehended the nature of the respondent's decision,
           it being a conducive decision and not an automatic  deportation.
           As a result paragraph 398 applies and  deportation  outside  the
           Rules can only take place in terms of 399 and 399A.  Under  that
           route the question is one  of  exceptionality.   This  does  not
           disclose a material error of law.  The "exceptionality" test was
           held to be the route by which a decision maker  should  consider
           Article 8.  It does not denote a test: MF (Nigeria) 2014  1  WLR
           545  and  MM  (Lebanon)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ   985   at   130-134.
           Consequently the material question  is  whether  the  Article  8
           analysis is vitiated by error of law.

    10.    The grounds having no merit, the appeal should be refused.

Submissions for SSHD.

 7. Mrs O'Brien said that her argument would expand upon  the  grounds  but
    that they were wide enough to encompass the points she wished to  make.
    The panel misdirected itself about the statutory basis of the case,  at
    paragraphs 13 to 17 wrongly setting out the law relevant to "conducive"
    rather than "automatic" deportation.   The  panel  misled  itself  into
    thinking that the decision making process did not involve the  exercise
    of discretion by the respondent.

 8. The SSHD had certified the decision under section  72(2)  of  the  2002
    Act.  The appellant did not challenge the certification in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, because he was not pressing his case under  the  Refugee
    Convention.  However, the certificate raised a  rebuttable  presumption
    that the appellant constitutes a risk to the community, which  remained
    relevant.  The appellant might say the point was immaterial because the
    real question was  a  balance  between  the  public  interest  and  any
    exceptional circumstances in favour of the  appellant,  but  the  panel
    made serious errors at the  beginning  which  vitiated  its  subsequent
    decision  making  process.   The  main  error  was  apparent  again  at
    paragraph 44, where the panel said  that  the  respondent  produced  no
    evidence to show risk to the general public, overlooking that the  onus
    is the other way.

 9.  There  was  an  absence  of  reasoning  to  explain  why   exceptional
    circumstances were found to  take  the  case  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The only factors mentioned were the general  circumstances  and
    level  of  terrorism  in  Iraq,  set  out  at  paragraphs  30-40.   The
    appellant's wife is also Iraqi and the children are young.  Given their
    origins, bad immigration  history,  and  family  situation,  there  was
    nothing to differentiate them from any other family returning to  Iraq.
    It was incongruous to find that general  instability  there  determined
    the appeal in their favour.  There were no findings which could justify
    the outcome.  The case  did  not  call  for  rehearing.   On  a  proper
    acknowledgement of the public interest, there was no strong  Article  8
    claim, no significant "best interests of the children" argument, and  a
    decision should be substituted to dismiss the appeal.

Submissions for appellant.

10. Mr Byrne submitted that  the  argument  for  a  wider  significance  of
    section 72(2) went beyond the words of the statute and of  the  refusal
    letter at paragraph 6.   The  presumption  was  relevant  only  to  the
    Refugee Convention claim.  Once that was conceded and attention  turned
    to the family and private life consideration, there was no  presumption
    to rebut.  It does not carry over into the Immigration Rules and  wider
    Article 8 consideration.  It is not reflected in paragraph 398  of  the
    Rules and should not be artificially extended there.  The point was not
    argued in the First-tier Tribunal, is not in the grounds of  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal, and should not be entertained now.

11. Mr Byrne acknowledged that the panel wrongly identified  the  statutory
    underpinning of the decision.   He said that the point was  immaterial,
    because whether the procedure took place under the 1971 Act or the 2007
    Act the relevant consideration still  fell  to  be  carried  out  under
    paragraph 398 of the Rules and, if appropriate, under Article 8 outwith
    the Rules.  The outcome would be the same  whichever  statutory  regime
    had been thought to apply.

12. As to whether the panel correctly identified exceptional circumstances,
    Mr Byrne relied on the Rule 24 notice, set out above.  It was  relevant
    to consider circumstances in the country of return, on which the  panel
    correctly  cited  Maslov  factor  (viii)  at  paragraph   27   of   the
    determination.  The determination made it clear the difficulties  which
    were likely  to  arise  in  return  to  Iraq  particularly  with  young
    children, and it was open to the panel to place  such  weight  on  that
    situation as it did.

13. In the alternative, if error were  to  be  found,  Mr  Byrne  sought  a
    rehearing of the  evidence,  preferably  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    because (1) there would likely be a  lay  member  on  the  panel,  well
    placed to assess issues of the public interest, an advantage  of  which
    the appellant should not be deprived (2) the weighing of  the  evidence
    should proceed upon personal assessment of the  oral  evidence  of  the
    appellant and his wife and (3) any reassessment should be on the  basis
    of a full hearing and not "paper based."

Reply for SSHD.

14. Mrs O'Brien said she was not arguing that the statutory presumption  in
    section 72(2) had to be "read across" into every Article 8  assessment,
    but that because the appellant did not abandon his  Refugee  Convention
    the panel had to consider the effect of the presumption.

Discussion and conclusions.

15. Section 72(1) of the 2002 Act says:

           This section applies for the purpose  of  the  construction  and
           application  of  Article  33(2)  of   the   Refugee   Convention
           (exclusion from protection).

16. There has been no reference to any provision applying  section  72  for
    any other purpose.  The scheme of the refusal letter is to treat it  as
    significant only in relation to the Refugee Convention  aspect  of  the
    case.  The panel was correct to regard the certificate  as  otiose  for
    its purposes.  The point argued is not in the grounds, and is unsound.

17. The appellant concedes that the panel was wrong to say that  this  case
    arises in terms of the 2007  Act.   This  point  is  also  not  in  the
    grounds, but  it  would  be  wrong  to  overlook  an  error  about  the
    applicable statute, if that was  fundamental.   Mrs  O'Brien  submitted
    that the panel misled itself  into  thinking  that  the  case  did  not
    involve the respondent exercising any discretion about  which  decision
    to make.  That might have been  a  significant  misconception  in  some
    instances, but here I prefer the submission that it has no  significant
    bearing on the "exceptional  circumstances"  or  proportionality  issue
    which the panel ultimately had to decide.

18. At paragraph 21 the panel correctly poses the question of  "exceptional
    circumstances" in terms of paragraph 398(c), 399 and 399A of the Rules.
     From paragraphs 23 onwards  the  determination  treats  the  issue  as
    whether to go outside the Rules and if so on what basis.  It looks  for
    and purports to find "very exceptional  and  compelling  circumstances"
    (paragraph 29) and a "special arguable  case  ...  outside  the  Rules"
    (paragraphs 43 and 44)  without  ever  considering  whether  there  are
    "exceptional circumstances" within the Rules.  In spite  of  that,  the
    panel says at paragraph 46 that "the appeal under the Immigration Rules
    is allowed".  At paragraph 48 the appeal  is  also  "allowed  on  human
    rights grounds under Article 8".  There is no explanation  of  why  the
    appeal should be allowed on that basis, if the appellant  had  met  the
    terms of the Rules.

19. The panel was referred to  several  cases  but  apparently  not  to  MF
    (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, [2014] Imm AR 211.  I do not set
    out in full here the discussion in that case at paragraphs 35 - 46, but
    it might have saved the panel from its confusion.  I draw from MF  that
    the distinction between approaching Article 8 in or out of the Rules is
    more apparent than real (p.37); the exceptional circumstances in  terms
    of the Rules incorporate a proportionality test including all  relevant
    Article 8 criteria (p.44); and the result would be the same in  or  out
    of the Rules.  This is the  point  made  in  the  appellant's  rule  24
    response.

20. Does it matter that the panel became confused about  whether  the  case
    needed to be decided in or out of the Rules, or  both,  and  about  the
    phrasing of the relevant tests?  It needed only to decide whether there
    were  exceptional  circumstances  such  that  the  public  interest  in
    deportation was outweighed by other factors.  That is not an  issue  of
    primary fact, but it is a highly fact-sensitive assessment.   The  case
    raises an anxious and emotive question about the return of a family  to
    Iraq, but the facts on which the  assessment  is  to  be  reached  were
    uncontentious and straightforward.  I find that the  panel's  confusion
    is ultimately irrelevant to the outcome.

21. The real complaints to be extracted from the SSHD's  grounds  are  that
    the panel did not adequately explain what the exceptional circumstances
    were, and  that  general  country  difficulties  which  fall  short  of
    invoking international protection cannot suffice.  The  reply  for  the
    appellant is that those complaints are only disagreement and  a  re-run
    of the case.

22. I find this issue finely balanced.  The First-tier Tribunal  assessment
    did (as I observed in course of submissions) come perilously close to a
    general finding that an ordinary Iraqi family  cannot  be  expected  to
    return, due to the difficulties in the  country.   The  panel  did  not
    conduct an overall country analysis to justify that, and  it  would  be
    out of  line  with  Upper  Tribunal  and  other  case  law  on  general
    protection needs of Iraqi citizens.   Although   Mr  Byrne  pointed  to
    "Maslov factor (viii)"  of  the  seriousness  of  difficulties  in  the
    country of removal, that goes to problems of non-nationals in a foreign
    country, not returning nationals.  However, relative disadvantages  may
    have some relevance.  The panel noted recent dramatic deterioration  in
    the country situation.  That in itself is not an error.   Although  the
    panel explained earlier  why  issues  of  the  best  interests  of  the
    children  did  not  advance  the  appellant's  case  significantly,  at
    paragraph 43 account was also taken of their best interests in relation
    to "having to live in such an environment".  Again, some  weight  could
    be given.  At paragraph 44 the panel took account  of  the  appellant's
    non-offending over the last 6 years, and gave reasons for finding  that
    he did not present a risk.  There is a slip about  the  respondent  not
    producing evidence, but the finding of no risk was open to  the  panel,
    and is justified by  the  considerations  set  out.   Contrary  to  the
    grounds, the panel did not regard this  as  determinative.   It  was  a
    factor correctly found to weigh on the appellant's side.

23. Much of the grounds do amount to a re-run of the case.  The  panel  had
    more to say about the relevant factors than the grounds recognise.  Not
    all panels of the First-tier Tribunal might have arrived  at  the  same
    assessment, but it is adequately supported.

24. If the determination had been set aside,  I  would  not  have  directed
    fresh hearing of evidence either in the First-tier Tribunal or  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  The appellant has had the chance to  put  forward  his
    case in full.  There has been no application to lead further  evidence,
    and no suggestion that the important facts have changed.  In  terms  of
    Practice Statement 7.2 the case would have been apt for remaking of the
    decision   in the Upper Tribunal, based upon submissions.

25. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

26. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
