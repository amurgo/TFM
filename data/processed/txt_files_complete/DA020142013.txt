Representation:
For the appellant:     In person
For the respondent:    Miss E Savage, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal to deport him to his  country  of  origin  as  a  foreign
    criminal pursuant to sections 32 and 33 of the UK Borders Act 2007, and
    to refuse him leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  under  paragraphs
    399 and 399A on Article 8 ECHR private and family life grounds  of  the
    Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended) or pursuant to section 55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Sierra Leone, born there in November 1984
    and now  31  years  old.    The  appellant's  evidence  in  his  asylum
    interview was that his father was of Lebanese  origin  and  his  mother
    half-Lebanese, and that he went to a Lebanese school in Freetown, where
    he learned Arabic as well as English. He could no longer  remember  his
    written or spoken Arabic:  it  had  been  too  long.   His  father  and
    grandfather were Sierra Leonean born and  all  the  family  had  Sierra
    Leonean citizenship.

 3. The appellant's family left Sierra  Leone  because  of  the  civil  war
    there, travelling to America for a better life in  1993  or  1995.   He
    would have been between 9  and  11  years  old  then.   In  his  asylum
    interview, the appellant  said  that  all  the  rest  of  their  family
    scattered too, some in Belgium, and others elsewhere in  Europe.  There
    was nobody left in Sierra Leone.

 4. In 1997, age 13, the appellant arrived in the United Kingdom  from  New
    York to join his father here.   His  mother  was  to  have  joined  the
    family, but did not do so: she stayed  in  America.   In  1998  he  was
    granted refugee status as his father's dependant and  given  indefinite
    leave to remain. He lost his refugee status by  cessation  on  26  July
    2013 pursuant to Article 1C(5) of the Refugee Convention and his asylum
    status was revoked under paragraph 339A(v) of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The appellant has been in the United Kingdom lawfully throughout.

 5. The appellant had a 10-year history of escalating  criminality  between
    April 2002 and April 2012, when he was imprisoned for 2 years.  He  was
    released in May 2013 on licence. I have not seen any record of  further
    criminal activity or sentence after his release and Ms Savage  was  not
    aware of any further offences.

 6. He has a British citizen partner, who has 2 sons, one of whom  is  his.
    Both boys are also British citizens.

Criminal history

 7. The appellant's Police National Computer (PNC) record summarises him as
    having been convicted under his own name and 6  aliases,  beginning  in
    2002, when he was almost 18 years old, with  an  three  convictions  in
    April 2002 at Enfield Juvenile Court of taking a motor vehicle  without
    consent, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence, and using
    a vehicle whilst uninsured, for which he received a 4 months'  referral
    order and 6 penalty points endorsed on his  driving  licence,  together
    with �50 costs.

 8. The next offence was in November 2007, when the appellant was 23  years
    old:  he  was  convicted  at  Norwich  Magistrates'  Court  of  driving
    otherwise than in accordance with a  licence,  using  a  vehicle  while
    uninsured, making off  without  paying  and  failing  to  surrender  to
    custody.  He still only had a provisional licence and had filled up his
    car with petrol without paying for it and driven off. He was  sentenced
    to 1 day's detention in the courthouse, and a further 6 penalty  points
    on his driving licence, and fined �70 plus �20.01 compensation.

 9. On 16 March 2009, age 24, the appellant  was  convicted  at  South-East
    Essex Magistrates' Court of the more serious offence  of  battery.   He
    had pleaded not guilty.  Police records show  that  he  was  travelling
    with a dog on a train with two other men; they got into an  altercation
    with a passenger who criticised their handling of the dog and all 3 men
    attacked him, kicking and punching him about the head and body, causing
    injuries. He was sentenced to a 12  months'  community  order,  with  a
    requirement  for  6  months'   drug   rehabilitation   treatment,   and
    supervision.  He was ordered to pay costs of �150.

10. On 24 July  2009,  the  appellant  was  convicted  at  Mid-South  Essex
    Magistrates' Court of using threatening, abusive,  insulting  words  or
    behaviour with the intention to cause fear or provocation of  violence,
    while on bail. He had pleaded not guilty. He was one of 18 men who were
    detained following a serious outbreak  of  public  disorder  in  Greys,
    Essex. His supervision requirement was suspended, and the appellant was
    sentenced to 10 weeks' imprisonment, wholly suspended  for  12  months,
    and costs of �300.

11. On 6 July 2011, age 26, the appellant was convicted at South-East Essex
    Magistrates' Court of driving a  motor  vehicle  with  excess  alcohol,
    driving while uninsured, and driving otherwise than in accordance  with
    a licence. He was found in possession of 3 bank  cards  which  did  not
    belong to him, but was not charged with any offence in relation to  the
    cards. He pleaded guilty to  the  charges  and  was  disqualified  from
    driving for 12 months, fined a  total  of  �750,  his  driving  licence
    endorsed, and ordered  to  pay  costs  and  victim  surcharge.   If  he
    completed an appropriate course of training, his disqualification would
    be reduced.

12. On 14 March 2012, now age 27, the  appellant  was  convicted  at  South
    Essex Magistrates' Court of making false representations for gain or to
    cause loss.  He had intercepted and used a credit card sent out in  the
    postal system, using it to buy goods on the internet  valued  at  $455.
    He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a community order of  80  hours'
    unpaid work within the next 12  months,  under  the  supervision  of  a
    probation order, together with costs of �85.

13. It was not long before the appellant was again  in  difficulty.   On  5
    April 2012, he was convicted at the Central Criminal Court of the index
    offence, the most serious of his convictions, conspiracy to make  false
    representations for gain for himself  or  another,  or  cause  loss  to
    others or expose them to the risk of loss.  It was committed while  the
    appellant was on bail from the  previous  offence.  The  appellant  and
    another man had corrupted a postal worker and committed identity theft:
    they had intercepted delivery of two orders for  gold  Krugerrands,  to
    the value of over �50,000. The  sentencing  judge  indicated  that  the
    normal sentence for  each  of  them  would  have  been  3  years.   The
    appellant and his  co-conspirator  had  pleaded  guilty  at  the  first
    reasonable  opportunity.   They  were  each  sentenced  to   2   years'
    imprisonment with electronic tagging.

14. The First-tier Tribunal also had before it  a  witness  statement  from
    Geoffrey Gordon Worsdell, a Detective Constable with  the  Metropolitan
    Police, setting out information  from  the  Metropolitan  Police  Crime
    Reporting Information System (CRIS) and criminal  intelligence  reports
    (CRIMINT). Those two systems contained further incidents which did  not
    proceed to prosecution:

      i) June 2006 - theft of a motor vehicle (arrested but not charged);

     ii) November 2006 - attempted robbery (arrested, later eliminated  from
         the enquiry);

    iii) February 2007 -  robbery  and  taking  a  vehicle  without  consent
         (arrested, victim withdrew allegations);

     iv) May 2007 - assaulting his partner (he had kicked her  in  the  face
         and around her body, case not proceeded with and closed);

      v) June 2007 - two offences: aggravated burglary (demanding money with
         menaces, stealing a Nintendo DS valued at �300,  arrested  but  not
         charged); and affray (arrested, insufficient evidence, not  charged
         and released);

     vi) July 2007 - possession of an offensive weapon in a public place  (a
         friction lock  baton,  in  a  car  with  three  men  including  the
         appellant, not possible to establish who had been in possession, so
         no charges and all 3 released); public order  (swearing  at  police
         officers who were arresting someone else,  issued  with  a  penalty
         notice);

    vii) December 2007 - stop and search in December 2007 (not arrested  and
         released);

   viii) August 2008 - drunk and disorderly (fixed penalty notice);

     ix) March  2009  -  another  offence  of  making  off  without  payment
         (arrested, not prosecuted);

      x) April 2009 - criminal damage (forcing open a manual ticket barrier,
         case withdrawn the next day);

     xi) 2010 - Essex Police records stated that 'intelligence suggests [the
         appellant] to be a member of a criminal gang  involved  in  serious
         crime';

    xii) May 2011 - two assaults on his partner, in one of which he hit  her
         in the face  with  a  shoe  causing  possible  nasal  fracture  and
         bruising (investigation later closed);

   xiii) July 2011 - stopped and searched on suspicion of  being  under  the
         influence of drugs, and smelling strongly of cannabis (no arrest or
         charges).

First-tier Tribunal decision

15. First-tier Tribunal Judges Petherbridge and Lobo heard  the  appeal  in
    October 2014.  The Tribunal recorded that the appellant had been  in  a
    relationship  with  his  partner  for  approximately   6   years:   the
    appellant's evidence was that they were not engaged,  but  the  partner
    said they were.  The  appellant's  sister  also  lives  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

16. The appellant was released from prison in May 2013  and  went  to  live
    with his sister, because his partner had no room in her home.   He  had
    also been living with his sister before going to  prison,  because  his
    partner found his impending imprisonment stressful.

17. The appellant's evidence was that he resumed living with his partner in
    the  autumn  of  2013,  in  September  or  October.    There   was   no
    documentation to confirm that the appellant had lived with his  partner
    at  the  addresses  where  she  lived  during  that  time:  no  tenancy
    agreements, or utility bills, bearing his name or  their  joint  names.
    All those documents were in his partner's sole name.

18. The Tribunal considered evidence of the appellant's financial position:
    he claimed to have commenced working with  a  solar  panel  company  in
    January 2014 and was able to produce the copy employment contract which
    he had signed, but not the copy signed by his employer.

19. The appellant's partner gave oral evidence and said that she would  not
    go to Sierra Leone and that if he were removed there, it would ruin her
    life and that of her children. Her evidence, in contrast  to  his,  was
    that they were in fact engaged. She denied that  he  had  attacked  her
    twice in May 2007, but accepted that in January 2012 there had  been  a
    domestic incident and she had to call the police.

20. The appellant's sister confirmed his account that  he  lived  with  her
    before and after going to prison, later amending that to 'stayed'  with
    her.

21. The First-tier Tribunal  doubted  that  the  relationship  between  the
    appellant  and  his  partner  was  genuine  and  subsisting.   In   the
    alternative, if it was, they accepted that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to the partner and children following the appellant to Sierra
    Leone but considered that contact could be  maintained  by  visits  and
    modern methods of communication.

22. They accepted the appellant's claimed date of  arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom but  discounted  the  time  spent  in  prison.   He  could  not
    therefore show 15 years' continuous  lawful  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom ('most of his life').

23. The Tribunal considered private life under paragraph 399A of the Rules.
      They  accepted  that  the  appellant  was  socially  and   culturally
    integrated into the United Kingdom but not that he  had  been  lawfully
    resident here for 'most of his life'.

24. In analysing private and family life under  this  head,  they  accepted
    that there was a genuine and subsisting relationship between  him,  his
    partner, and the children.  They  considered  whether  the  appellant's
    deportation from the United  Kingdom  would  be  unduly  harsh,  having
    regard to its having been formed while he was  in  the  United  Kingdom
    lawfully. They concluded that it would not be and  that  the  appellant
    could lawfully be removed to Sierra Leone.

25. The Tribunal gave weight to the public interest and considered that the
    interference with such private and family  life  as  existed  would  be
    proportionate. The appeal was dismissed on all grounds.

Appeal to Upper Tribunal

26. The appellant challenged that decision,  arguing  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had misapplied section 117C of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended); that he had been lawfully resident in
    the United Kingdom for most of his life; that  the  Tribunal  erred  in
    deducting his period of imprisonment, since he was 'still in the United
    Kingdom under Her  Majesty's  order'  during  that  time;  that  he  is
    socially and culturally integrated into the United  Kingdom;  and  that
    there are significant obstacles to his reintegration in  Sierra  Leone,
    given the length of time he has spent in  the  United  States  and  the
    United Kingdom since leaving his country of origin.

27. He contended that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to  give  detailed
    analysis to the best interests of  his  children;  that  his  financial
    independence was irrelevant to the proportionality of removal; and that
    he had a genuine and subsisting relationship with  his  partner  and  a
    qualifying child, on whom his deportation would be unduly harsh.

28. The appellant contended that the decision to deprive him of his British
    citizenship is unduly harsh and not in accordance with  the  law.  This
    argument was not renewed before me and I do not understand it since  he
    is not and never has been a British citizen.  I place no weight on that
    argument at all.

29. The appellant relied upon YM (Uganda) v SSHD [2014] EWCA  Civ  1292  at
    [54] and argued that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  not  conducted  a
    rounded assessment of all relevant  circumstances  when  assessing  the
    proportionality of removal.

Permission to appeal

30. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused by Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Davey. The appellant  sought  judicial  review  of  that
    refusal, successfully. On 2 September 2015, Master Gidden  quashed  the
    Upper Tribunal's refusal to grant permission to appeal. It is not clear
    from the papers before me what was the error  of  law  contemplated  by
    Master Gidden.

31. On 30 September 2015, Vice-President  Ockelton  granted  permission  to
    appeal, noting simply that 'the Upper Tribunal's task is that  set  out
    in s.12 of the 2007 Act', which so far as relevant is as follows:

         "12  Proceedings on appeal to Upper Tribunal

         (1)  Subsection (2) applies if the Upper Tribunal, in  deciding  an
         appeal under section 11, finds that  the  making  of  the  decision
         concerned involved the making of an error on a point of law.

         (2)  The Upper Tribunal-

             (a)  may (but need not) set aside the decision of  the  First-
             tier Tribunal, and

             (b)  if it does, must either-

                  (i)  remit  the  case  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  with
                  directions for its reconsideration, or

                  (ii) re-make the decision."

Rule 24 Reply

32. On 15 October 2015, the respondent served a Rule 24 Reply, opposing the
    appeal.  The material part of her response is as follows:

         "3.  Taking the Crown Court's comments at their highest,  that  say
         no more than that during his period of licence there is  no  reason
         to believe he will re-offend. In  any  event,  the  panel  properly
         considered this comment in reaching their conclusion.  At paragraph
         104, the panel properly applied the more recent test  with  respect
         to ties, of 'very significant obstacles'. "

33. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

34. The appellant appeared in person at the  Upper  Tribunal  hearing.   He
    stated that his representatives had told him,  on  Friday  12  February
    2016, just a few days before the hearing on February 15, that they were
    unable to represent him  at  the  hearing  for  what  he  described  as
    financial reasons.  The appellant had decided to represent himself.  He
    said he had 'come to the hearing to get on with [the appeal]'.  He  did
    not wish to seek an adjournment.

35. I took the  appellant  through  his  history,  and  in  particular  his
    offending history, as I have summarised  it  above.  He  confirmed  its
    accuracy. I then told the appellant that I would  ask  Ms  Savage,  who
    appeared for the respondent, to make her case, and then invite  him  to
    respond, so that he  would  be  able  to  deal  with  the  respondent's
    arguments more fully. He agreed to that approach.

36. Ms Savage in her submissions referred the Tribunal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision at [106].  She argued  that  there  was  no  material
    error of law in the panel's consideration of the evidence and the  law;
    that all evidence had been  considered  and  the  weight  to  be  given
    thereto was a matter for the fact-finding Tribunal.

37. She accepted that the appellant had spent 'most of  his  life'  in  the
    United Kingdom, but argued that the First-tier Tribunal had applied the
    correct test at [90] and that adequate reasons for its conclusions were
    given at [91]-[95].  Section 117C had not been omitted and all relevant
    circumstances had been taken into account.  The panel had been entitled
    to find, for the reasons  it  gave,  that  neither  section  117C,  nor
    paragraph 399A of the Rules, availed the appellant on  the  facts.  The
    length of time spent in prison was immaterial to the  outcome,  on  the
    basis of the clear findings of fact.

38. The appellant in his oral submissions reminded me that he had  been  in
    the United Kingdom since 1997, that he had school friends, family,  and
    a beautiful son  and  stepson  here.   He  deeply  regretted  his  past
    criminality and now wanted just to move forward and lead a normal life.
     The threat of deportation hung over his future: all  his  family  were
    here, his sister, his nephews and nieces, and his  child  and  partner.
    His mother was in America but he had not spoken to her for 10 years.

39. The appellant said he was now working full time as an estate  agent  in
    Shoreditch  and  providing  for  his  family  without   any   financial
    assistance from the State. He spoke only English and had not  lived  in
    Sierra Leone since he was 7 years old; he could not see himself  living
    anywhere else, as his culture was British.  He had a  great  bond  with
    his son and his partner and it would be against  his  human  rights  to
    split them up.

40. As regards the  domestic  violence  perpetrated  on  his  partner,  the
    appellant said that the 2007 incident was domestic violence by  someone
    other than him.  He agreed that he had attacked his partner in 2011 and
    2012, and said that he had been unhappy and confused.  His father, whom
    he had come to the United Kingdom to join in 1997,  died  in  2011  and
    there had been a lot of issues for him.   The  violence  occurred  just
    before he went to prison.  The appellant had been released in 2012  and
    there had been no further problems, as confirmed both by the  CRIS  and
    CRIMINT record and by Ms Savage at the hearing.

41. The appellant asked me to set aside the First-tier Tribunal  and  allow
    his appeal.

42. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

Discussion

43. There is  not  much  dispute  about  the  facts  of  this  appeal:  the
    appellant's family left Sierra Leone when he was very young, less  than
    10 years old, then spent some time in America.  His father came  on  to
    the United Kingdom and the appellant joined him here.  His  criminality
    was longstanding and of increasing seriousness, culminating in a 2-year
    sentence.  He has always said that he had  no  family  left  in  Sierra
    Leone and the respondent has not challenged that assertion.

44. The appellant's relationship with the mother of his child has  left  no
    documentary trace at the addresses where she has lived, and the  First-
    tier Tribunal had some  doubt  whether  it  subsisted.   There  was  no
    evidence, beyond an assertion in oral evidence, of undue  harshness  in
    the separation of the appellant from his partner and child.  It is  not
    in dispute that the  partner's  children,  both  of  whom  are  British
    citizens, have the right to grow up here and that it is unreasonable to
    expect them to live with him in Sierra Leone.

45. The Immigration Rules represent a complete code, so far  as  Article  8
    ECHR is concerned: MF (Nigeria)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192.  The
    appellant must be able to bring himself within the Rules if  he  is  to
    succeed. In this case, the relevant rules are set out in paragraphs 398-
    399A:

         "398.    Where a person claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
         contrary to the UK's obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human
         Rights Convention, and ...

                (b)     the  deportation  of  the  person  from  the  UK  is
                conducive to the public good  and  in  the  public  interest
                because they have been convicted of  an  offence  for  which
                they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less
                than 4 years but at least 12 months; ...  the  Secretary  of
                State  in  assessing  that  claim  will   consider   whether
                paragraph 399 or 399A applies  and,  if  it  does  not,  the
                public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by
                other factors where there are very compelling  circumstances
                over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
         if -

                (a)    the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                relationship with a child under the age of 18 years  who  is
                in the UK, and

                    (i)    the child is a British Citizen; ...and...

                        (a)    it would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to
                        live in the country to which the person  is  to  be
                        deported; and

                        (b)    it would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to
                        remain in the UK without the person who  is  to  be
                        deported; or

                (b) the person has a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
                with a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen  or
                settled in the UK, and

                    (i)    the relationship was formed at a  time  when  the
                    person (deportee) was  in  the  UK  lawfully  and  their
                    immigration status was not precarious; and

                    (ii)   it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live
                    in the country to which the person is  to  be  deported,
                    because of compelling circumstances over and above those
                    described in paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

                    (iii)  it would be unduly  harsh  for  that  partner  to
                    remain in the  UK  without  the  person  who  is  to  be
                    deported.

         399A.    This paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
         applies if -

                (a)    the person has been lawfully resident in the  UK  for
                most of his life; and

                (b)    he is socially and culturally integrated in  the  UK;
                and

                (c)    there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
                integration into the country to which it is proposed  he  is
                deported."

46. There are thus three ways within the Rules in which a  deportation  may
    be resisted: by reference to a parental  relationship,  a  relationship
    with a partner, or on the basis of social and cultural integration into
    the United Kingdom coupled with significant  obstacles  to  integration
    into the country to which the person is to be removed.

Parental relationship

47. It is not in dispute that the appellant has a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with his son, nor that the boy cannot be  removed
    from the United Kingdom. The evidence was less strong  in  relation  to
    his  stepson,  but  the  First-tier  Tribunal  dealt  with  both   when
    considering whether the test in sub-paragraph  399(a)  was  met.    The
    question is whether it is unduly harsh for the appellant's  son  and/or
    his stepson to remain in the United Kingdom without  him.   The  First-
    tier Tribunal considered that question at [82], having  summarised  the
    relevant evidence at [77]-[81].  The factual assessment there  made  is
    adequately reasoned  and  sustainable,  having  regard  to  the  sparse
    evidence in relation to the children which had  been  produced  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Partner relationship

48. Regarding the relationship with his  partner,  the  Tribunal  expressed
    some doubts at [66]-[68] and [84] in relation to the  strength  of  the
    relationship between the appellant  and  his  partner.   It  found,  in
    particular, that on a number of occasions she  had  called  the  police
    because he had assaulted her. The evidence as to when  they  had  lived
    together was unclear: the appellant had  lived  with  his  sister  both
    before and after going to prison, and the  evidence  of  resumption  of
    cohabitation was not very satisfactory. There was divergent evidence as
    to whether they were engaged or intended to marry each other.

49. Even taking the account at its  highest,  and  accepting  that  as  the
    mother of two British citizens, insurmountable obstacles existed to her
    returning to Sierra Leone, the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  consider
    that the family life between the appellant and his partner was such  as
    to outweigh the public interest in deportation. Again,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal gave adequate, intelligible and sustainable reasons for  those
    findings.

Integration in the United Kingdom and Sierra Leone

50. The Tribunal noted at [91] that English, which the appellant speaks, is
    the official language of Sierra Leone, and that  he  still  had  family
    members there.  They found that he would have retained knowledge of the
    culture of Sierra Leone and had not satisfied them that he could not re-
    adapt to Sierra Leone with the support of members  of  his  family  and
    friends there.  It is not clear to me from the evidence why the  First-
    tier Tribunal considered that the appellant had family in Sierra Leone:
    his undisputed evidence is to the contrary effect. That error of  fact,
    if so it be, is not challenged in the grounds of appeal.  The appellant
    maintained today at the hearing that his family all live outside Sierra
    Leone and he has no  family  members  there.   His  evidence  has  been
    consistent on that point since  the  original  asylum  interview.   The
    appellant is an adult, and a resourceful one: if the Tribunal has  made
    an error of fact in this respect, I do not consider it to  be  material
    to the outcome of the appeal.

51. No exceptional circumstances were advanced, save that the appellant had
    a bad back: there was no evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  that
    bad backs could not be treated in Sierra Leone.

52. The First-tier Tribunal did not consider that the evidence before  them
    established the enhanced ties between sibling and sibling  which  might
    constitute family life between him and his sister (see [99]).

Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended)

53. In considering section 117B of the 2002 Act  at  [109]  the  First-tier
    Tribunal fell into error in that it  considered  that  the  appellant's
    fluency in English and financial circumstances might be relevant to the
    decision whether he could be removed. The Tribunal  did  not  have  the
    benefit of the guidance given in AM (S.117B) [2015] UKUT 260  (IAC)  at
    (2) in the judicial headnote:

         "(2) An appellant can obtain no positive right to a grant of  leave
         to remain from either s117B (2) or (3), whatever the degree of  his
         fluency in English, or the strength of his financial resources."

    I therefore take no account of the appellant's employment and financial
    circumstances or the fact that he speaks English.

54.  The  'little  weight'  provisions  of  section  117B(4)  and  (5)  are
    inapplicable as the appellant has been lawfully in the  United  Kingdom
    throughout.   Section  117B(6)  concerns  only  those  not  subject  to
    deportation.

55. The Tribunal then considered section 117C, the test in which, as  noted
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Storey in KMO  (section  117  -  unduly  harsh)
    Nigeria [2015] UKUT 543 (IAC), overlaps with the test in paragraphs 399
    and 399A.  In Forman (ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT  412  (IAC)
    at [20], Mr  Justice  McCloskey,  giving  the  judgment  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal, said this:

         "20. The rigid, prescriptive nature of sections 117A - 117C of  the
         2002 Act invites reflection on the topic  of  judgment  design  and
         structure. Where the decisions of tribunals  list,  explicitly  and
         sequentially, each  of  the  obligatory  statutory  considerations,
         accompanied by the Tribunal's evaluation and  application  thereof,
         there should be no scope for debate. Adherence to  this  discipline
         will have the supreme merit of reducing the possibility of error of
         law. This is illustrated in MK  (section  55  -  Tribunal  options)
         [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC), at [41] - [43]. Furthermore,  tribunals  are
         well used to having to craft their decisions in accordance with the
         dictates of discipline and structure, in  the  light  of  decisions
         such as Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27, at [17]. The same exhortation
         is made in relation to the Tribunal's exercise  of  evaluating  and
         applying the related provisions of the Immigration Rules:  see  MK,
         at [45] - [49]. Fundamentally, the decision must be crafted in such
         a way as to demonstrate that the statutory requirements  have  been
         given full effect."

56. This is such a case.  The First-tier Tribunal  considered  all  of  the
    statutory considerations  sequentially  and  analysed  them  carefully.
    Despite the errors as to the relevance of his  financial  circumstances
    and perhaps also the existence of family in Sierra Leone, all  relevant
    facts and matters have been properly considered and I am satisfied that
    there is 'no room for debate' in the outcome of that consideration.

57. I find, therefore, that there is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal and I uphold it.

DECISION

58. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law.

    I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
