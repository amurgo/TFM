Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr W Rees, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge L K Gibbs dismissing his appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent to refuse his asylum claim.

2.   The appellant entered the UK on 22 September 2012 with leave to  remain
    as a Tier 4 Student valid from 4 September 2012 to 30  July  2013.   He
    claimed asylum on 12 August 2015 on the basis of  his  sexuality.   His
    claim was refused in a decision  dated  19  May  2016.   The  appellant
    appealed against that decision and attended  an  appeal  hearing  on  7
    November 2016.  His appeal was dismissed in a decision  promulgated  on
    22 November 2016.  In a decision promulgated on 27 February  2017,  the
    First-tier Judge's decision was set  aside  in  order  to  be  reheard.
    Judge Gibbs reheard the appeal and dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal.
    It is against  this  decision  that  the  appellant  has  been  granted
    permission.

3.   The appellant  claimed  that  as  a  school  boy  he  realised  he  was
    interested in  boys  and  had  no  attraction  to  girls.   Within  his
    friendship group were two other boys who felt the same way  as  he  did
    and the three of them started a sexual relationship  which  lasted  for
    three to four years.  They rented hotel rooms to engage in their sexual
    activities once or twice a month.

4.   The appellant said he was around 15 or 16 years of age when  a  friend,
    who did not approve of his activities, told his father that he was gay.
     His family tried to get him to change and when this  was  unsuccessful
    tried to arrange a marriage for him in  2001  but  he  refused.   As  a
    result he was beaten by his family.   The  appellant  agreed  with  his
    family that if they let him travel to the UK to finish his  degree,  he
    would agree to get married on his return to Pakistan.

5.   The appellant claimed that since  arriving  in  the  UK  he  has  lived
    openly as a gay man, enjoying relationships with men.  He is  a  member
    of various gay clubs.  He did not claim asylum earlier because  he  was
    unaware that he could.  He said his father died in September  2013  and
    he has not had any contact with his family since then.  He is afraid of
    his family and society in general if he had to return to Pakistan.

6.   The appellant  has  criminal  convictions.   On  4  July  2016  he  was
    convicted at Cambridgeshire  Magistrates'  Court  for  making  a  false
    representation to make gain for  self  or  another  or  cause  loss  to
    other/expose  other  to  risk  and  was  sentenced   to   four   weeks'
    imprisonment and a victim surcharge of ï¿½115.  On 20  May  2017  he  was
    convicted at Northumbria Magistrates' Court on similar charges.  He was
    committed to Newcastle Crown Court and  sentenced  to  sixteen  months'
    imprisonment concurrent to a sentence imposed at Portsmouth Crown Court
    on the same day.  On  29  June  2017  at  Portsmouth  Crown  Court  the
    appellant was convicted of seventeen counts of dishonestly making false
    representations, similar charges as those before and was sentenced to a
    total of eighteen months' imprisonment  and  twelve  months  concurrent
    imprisonment.  As a consequence of this the respondent made a  decision
    on 19 October 2017 to deport the appellant.

7.   The respondent rejected the appellant's claim  in  its  entirety.   The
    respondent did not accept that the appellant is a gay man and  was  not
    persuaded that he would be at risk on return to Pakistan.

8.   The judge heard oral evidence from the appellant in English.

9.   The judge's findings and conclusions are set out at  paragraphs  19  to
    30.

10.  At paragraph 19 the judge said  the  medical  evidence  relied  on  the
    appellant only said that the appellant underwent a  scrotal  ultrasound
    because of a suspected "epididymal cyst" on 24 January 2016.  She  said
    the appellant's representative who happened to be a Professor Rees  was
    unable to explain why this was evidence of  the  appellant's  sexuality
    although the appellant maintained in oral evidence that it was evidence
    of a sexually transmitted disease following  intercourse  with  a  man.
    The judge was not satisfied that this was true.  The judge  found  that
    the evidence before her was simply that the appellant had  a  suspected
    cyst on his right testicle which he was satisfied was  not  a  sexually
    transmitted disease and was not evidence of the appellant's  sexuality.
    I note that this finding was not challenged by the appellant.

11.  At paragraph 20 the judge said she placed weight  on  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer's  submission  that  the  fact  of  the  appellant's
    criminal convictions was evidence  of  the  appellant's  proclivity  to
    dishonesty.  The judge said that although  it  would  appear  that  the
    appellant told the probation service that he had been forced  to  carry
    out these activities, she placed weight on the fact  that  he  did  not
    address this issue in his witness statement or oral evidence.  She said
    that at no stage  in  the  report  (despite  there  being  sections  on
    "lifestyle and associates" and "emotional wellbeing") did the appellant
    mention his sexuality.

12.  Professor Rees submitted  that  the  appellant  accepted  the  criminal
    activities, simply pleaded guilty and took the  punishment.   This  was
    because according to the probation service  report,  he  committed  the
    offences due to threats to himself and also to his brother in Pakistan;
    and pleaded guilty because he did not have the evidence of the threats.
     Professor Rees submitted that the Home Office did not push this  point
    but the appellant was criticised for not  dealing  with  this  in  oral
    evidence.

13.  I find that the judge's decision at paragraph  20  cuts  both  ways  in
    that both parties failed to address this issue at the hearing.

14.  In any event, I find that the judge made a fair finding that  the  fact
    of the appellant's criminal convictions was evidence of his  proclivity
    to dishonesty.  He had pleaded guilty to the offences and therefore the
    judge could not go behind the decisions made by the criminal courts.  I
    find, as submitted by Mr Clarke, that in the probation  service  report
    there was no mention by the appellant of attending gay clubs  or  being
    part of the gay community when asked about his lifestyle and associates
    and emotional wellbeing.  Consequently, I find that paragraph  20  does
    not disclose an error of law in the judge's decision.

15.  At paragraph 21 in assessing  the  appellant's  credibility  the  judge
    placed weight on the fact that despite entering the UK  as  a  student,
    the appellant has failed to achieve any qualifications.  Although in  a
    letter written by the appellant's representatives to the UK  Visas  and
    Immigration on 12 October 2015 asserting that he  had  been  unable  to
    study because of illness, the judge found that there  was  no  evidence
    produced by the appellant to corroborate this assertion which she found
    in any event was contrary to the  appellant's  oral  evidence  that  he
    stopped studying when his father stopped paying his course  fees.   She
    also found that with regards to his  father,  the  appellant  initially
    said in cross-examination that his mother and father were  in  Pakistan
    but then claimed that his father had died in 2013.  She considered that
    this was a simple issue about which it was  reasonable  to  expect  the
    appellant to provide consistent evidence, and the  appellant's  failure
    to do so cast further doubt on his credibility.

16.  I find that the judge's finding at paragraph 21 does  not  disclose  an
    error of law.  Whilst the appellant's failure to get a degree does  not
    go to his credibility, what the judge was saying was that the appellant
    had given inconsistent evidence as to why he had been unable to  study.
    There was further inconsistency as to whether his father  had  died  in
    2013.  I find that  these  inconsistencies  undermine  the  appellant's
    credibility.

17.  At paragraph 22 with regards to her assessment of  the  subsistence  of
    the appellant's claim, the judge reminded herself  that  each  person's
    realisation regarding their sexuality will  be  an  individual  journey
    which some are better able to articulate than others.  With his in mind
    she considered the appellant's evidence, particularly in light  of  the
    criticisms  raised  in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal   Letter   and   the
    respondent's assertion that the appellant's evidence had been vague and
    often his responses were found to be  unclear.   At  paragraph  23  the
    judge did not place significant weight on when the appellant  said  his
    father found out about his sexuality.

18.  At paragraph 24 the judge calculated  that  the  appellant  would  have
    been around 12 or 13 when  his  relationship  with  two  of  his  class
    members started.  While this in itself did not lack  credibility,  what
    she found implausible was that at this young age the appellant and  his
    friends were able to rent hotel rooms without arousing  suspicion  once
    or twice a month.  Further she found that this chronology  was  out  of
    kilter with the appellant's answers  at  AIR  Q79  that  they  were  at
    college when they went to a hotel for sex, although  his  father  found
    out about this when he was 15 or 16.  I find no error of  law  in  this
    decision.

19.   At  paragraph  25  the  judge  found  that  the  appellant's  evidence
    regarding the consequences of this revelation was inconsistent.  On the
    one hand he said that he was beaten and spent most of his time  indoors
    (AIR Q38 and 41) but he also then claimed to have  continued  to  spend
    time with his gay friends (AIR Q41).  The judge found  that  it  lacked
    credibility that if the appellant  had  contact  with  gay  friends  in
    Pakistan that he would have continued to live with his  parents  for  a
    further three to four years prior to coming to the UK, or that,  having
    refused to enter into an arranged marriage in Pakistan, the appellant's
    father would have agreed to finance the appellant's student visa  to  a
    country where homosexuality is accepted on the basis that his son would
    agree to marry at the end of his studies.

20.  I found no error of law in the judge's findings at paragraph  25.   The
    judge made findings that were reasonably open to her.

21.  At paragraph 26 the judge  agreed  with  the  respondent's  conclusions
    that the appellant's answers regarding his attraction  to  his  friends
    Zuheb  and  Jamal  were  vague  and  lacking  credibility  despite  the
    questions themselves being simple.  There appeared to be  no  challenge
    to this finding either in the grounds or by Professor Rees.

22.  At paragraph 27  the  judge  found  that  the  appellant's  description
    regarding how he discovered that his two friends were also  gay  lacked
    credible detail, given the  country  background  information  regarding
    societal  perception  of  gay  people   in   Pakistan,   and   possible
    repercussions if a person is discovered.  She  found  that  when  asked
    about this the appellant was only able  to  say  at  question  61  that
    whenever they went out as friends, he noticed they would  not  talk  to
    girls, but they would take an interest in boys.  On the other hand, the
    other friends of his would be interested in contacting girls.

23.  Professor Rees submitted that in this decision the judge  was  focusing
    on how the appellant discovered that his two friends  were  gay  rather
    than the actual gay relationship that developed between them.

24.  I find no error of law in the judge's decision at paragraph 27  because
    in the previous paragraphs the judge had  disbelieved  the  appellant's
    evidence that he was gay and had a gay relationship  with  two  of  his
    school friends.  I find that the judge did not err in exploring how the
    appellant would have found out that his  two  friends  were  gay.   She
    found that the evidence was vague and not particularised. I  find  that
    this finding was open to her.

25.  At paragraph 28 the judge found that in the light of her concerns,  and
    the timing of the appellant's asylum claim, some two  years  after  his
    leave to remain had expired, cast further  doubt  on  his  credibility.
    She did not accept his evidence that he did  not  know  about  claiming
    asylum, particularly as his evidence is that his father stopped  paying
    his fees some six months after his arrival which meant that he  was  at
    risk of removal  quite  early  on.   The  judge  found  that  this  was
    inconsistent with a person who has a genuine fear of  return  to  their
    home country.

26.  The judge said at paragraph 29 that along these findings, she  did  not
    find that the documentary evidence regarding the appellant's membership
    of gay organisations, clubs and bars was  persuasive,  particularly  in
    the absence of witnesses to corroborate that these  are  used  and  are
    genuine.

27.  The challenge to this finding in the grounds was that  the  judge  fell
    into material error in not placing any real weight on  the  documentary
    evidence submitted by the appellant concerning his  membership  of  gay
    clubs as establishing his sexuality.  This would include the letters as
    long ago as August  2013  from  the  Gloucestershire  Gay  and  Lesbian
    Society and his membership of this grouping.  The grounds  went  on  to
    say that it is very hard to  believe  that  the  appellant  would  have
    joined gay clubs if he was not gay and this point has not been taken by
    the judge seemingly because of her focus on her  credibility  findings,
    which run counter to Awala [2015] CSOH 73 where at paragraph 22 it  was
    pointed out that it was "not proper to reject  an  applicant's  account
    merely on the basis that it is not credible or plausible".

28.  Professor Rees submitted that the appellant's  membership  of  the  gay
    clubs was genuine and that the judge did not consider the  evidence  in
    the round.  She rejected the objective evidence without considering the
    evidence in the round.

29.  I find no error of law in the judge's finding at paragraph 29.  I  find
    that the judge's decision was open to her.  If the appellant had joined
    a gay club in 2013, I agree with the  judge  that  in  the  absence  of
    witnesses to corroborate that he was actually using the clubs and  that
    his membership was indeed genuine.  When one  looks  at  the  provision
    service report, in the sections  on  "lifestyle  and  associates",  the
    appellant said he spent most of his time with friends, going to  movies
    and visiting the town centre.  And an emotional wellbeing it said  that
    he suffers from asthma otherwise he is fit  and  well.   No  self-harm,
    suicidal thoughts.  There was no mention that he was gay  and  that  if
    the Secretary of State's decision went against  him,  he  would  suffer
    emotional harm.  I find on the evidence that the judge's  decision  was
    fair.

30.  Professor Rees's main argument was that the  judge  did  not  have  any
    regard to HJ (Iran).  He had submitted to the judge at the hearing that
    the appellant was actually gay and even if he  is  treated  as  gay  on
    return, the perception would be sufficient to qualify him  for  asylum.
    He argued that the judge's failure to consider this  submission  was  a
    material error of law.

31.  I noted that this submission did not appear  in  the  decision  or  the
    judge's record of proceedings.  I accepted Professor Rees's  submission
    that the judge may not have recorded everything that was said to her at
    the hearing. Nevertheless, I find that the judge's failure to  consider
    the submission did not materially undermine her decision. The judge did
    not believe that the appellant is gay.  Therefore, if  he  is  not  gay
    there is no real likelihood of the appellant being treated as a gay man
    on his return to Pakistan.

32.  I find that the judge's  decision  discloses  no  error  of  law.   The
    judge's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
