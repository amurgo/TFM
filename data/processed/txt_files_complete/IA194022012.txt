                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Thorne
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 14th January 2013.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.  He arrived in the UK with a six
    month visit visa valid from February to August 2009.   He  returned  to
    his home country and entered the UK, again as a visitor, in April 2010.
     On 27th March 2012 he sought a residence card.

 3. On 17th August 2012 a decision was made to refuse to issue him  with  a
    residence card as confirmation  of  a  right  of  residence  under  the
    European Community Law as the extended family member of an EEA national
    exercising treaty rights in the UK.

 4. It is the Appellant's case that he is the extended family member of his
    uncle, Victor Idahosa, a German national, who became  his  guardian  on
    the death of his father.

 5. The judge did not accept  that  the  Appellant  was  dependent  on  the
    Sponsor prior to his entering the UK.  Neither did he  accept  that  he
    had been dependent on him since his arrival in the UK nor that he was a
    member of the Sponsor's household.

The Grounds of Application

 6. The Appellant sought permission to  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    documentary evidence clearly demonstrated that the Appellant  had  been
    dependent on the Sponsor ever since  his  father  died  in  1988.   The
    Sponsor was his formal guardian as confirmed in the document  from  his
    primary school.  Furthermore, there were two key  documents  which  the
    judge had failed to take into account when  reaching  his  conclusions,
    namely two sworn affidavits  from  the  Appellant's  mother  dated  4th
    January 2010 and 18th July  2011,  one  just  prior  to  the  Appellant
    entering the UK and the second after he had been living here.

 7. Furthermore the judge had had regard to  irrelevant  considerations  in
    stating that he doubted whether the Sponsor was able  to  maintain  the
    Appellant, which is not part of the relevant law  since  the  issue  is
    whether the Appellant is in fact financially dependent on  the  Sponsor
    for his essential needs.  There is no suggestion that the Appellant has
    any other form of support; it is irrational for the judge  to  conclude
    that the Appellant is not dependent on the Sponsor.

 8. It was acknowledged in the grounds that there was some confusion in the
    evidence as to where the Appellant lived for  the  first  three  months
    when he arrived in the UK but this was  a  minor  issue.   The  judge's
    comment that there were no bills to demonstrate that the Appellant  was
    part of the Sponsor's household was unreasonable since it was  not  his
    house.  The Appellant is not entitled to work  or  claim  benefits  and
    there is no possibility of him receiving any official  letters  at  the
    Sponsor's address.

 9. Finally there was a factual  error  when  the  judge  stated  that  the
    Sponsor had  been  financially  supporting  the  Appellant  since  1998
    whereas in fact it was 1988.  The Sponsor became a  German  citizen  in
    1998.  The documentary evidence confirmed that he has been  in  the  UK
    since 2004 and the  only  possible  conclusion  is  therefore  that  he
    acquired German  citizenship  by  that  date,  many  years  before  the
    Appellant came to the UK.

10. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Designated Judge Peart on
    13th February 2013 but subsequently granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Goldstein on 18th March 2013.

11. On  26th  March  2013  the  Respondent  served  a  reply  opposing  the
    application.

Submissions

12. Mr Cole relied on his grounds.  He submitted that the judge  had  erred
    in failing to take into account the relevant evidence, namely the sworn
    affidavits of the Appellant's mother which was material and supportive.
     He had applied an irrelevant test in relation to the Sponsor's ability
    to  maintain.   He  relied  on  the  case  of  Reyes  (EEA  Regulations
    dependency)  [2013]  UKUT  00314  which  held  that  whether  a  person
    qualifies as a dependant under the Regulations is to be  determined  at
    the date of decision on the basis  of  the  evidence  produced  to  the
    Respondent or on appeal at the date of hearing on the basis of evidence
    produced to the Tribunal.  He submitted that the Appellant had produced
    that evidence and that the appeal ought to be allowed.

13. Mrs Pettersen opposed the appeal.  She  submitted  that  the  documents
    from the Appellant's mother did not assist and had the  judge  referred
    to them he would have noted that there were inconsistencies between the
    written and oral evidence.  She said it was open to the judge to  state
    that the fact that the Sponsor had not produced  any  evidence  of  his
    circumstances hampered  the  Appellant  in  his  ability  to  establish
    dependency.  Finally, there was a serious discrepancy in  the  evidence
    as to where the Appellant had lived when he first came to the UK and it
    was wholly reasonable for the judge to take into  account  when  making
    his decision.

14. By way of reply Mr Cole  submitted  that  the  evidence  was  that  the
    Sponsor had been appointed the Appellant's guardian on the death of his
    father and there was no requirement that they live in the same country.
     There was evidence of remittances having been sent over the years.  He
    said that the Sponsor had submitted some evidence of his  circumstances
    and it was difficult for a person in the Appellant's position, who  had
    overstayed, to provide  documentary  evidence  of  his  residence.   In
    summary, the judge's reasoning was insufficient and it was not possible
    to read into it enough to make it legally adequate.

Findings and Conclusions

15. In order to succeed in this appeal the Appellant had to  show  that  he
    was dependent on the Sponsor or  was  a  member  of  his  household  in
    Nigeria and that he remains as a dependant or a member of his household
    in the UK.

16. It is not argued that the judge failed to  conduct  the  correct  legal
    analysis.  Nor is it argued that the Appellant  was  a  member  of  the
    Sponsor's household in Nigeria.

17. The Appellant says that the judge was wrong to find  that  he  had  not
    been dependent on the Sponsor since 1988.  The documents showed that Mr
    Idahosa had been appointed his  formal  guardian  and  that,  over  the
    years, he had sent money to him for his  essential  needs.   The  judge
    recorded that there was independent reliable  documentary  evidence  of
    some financial support from 2004 to 2009 namely eight receipts  showing
    payment of ï¿½250 between 2006  and  2009  plus  a  letter  from  Allwell
    Investments stating that money had been sent  by  the  Sponsor  to  the
    Appellant's mother monthly in 2004 and  2005  and  three  receipts  for
    school fees paid by him in 1994, 2000 and 2004.

18. The judge did not accept  that  the  Appellant  was  dependent  on  the
    Sponsor prior to his arrival in the UK in April 2010.  He said that the
    documentary evidence of financial support finished some fourteen months
    before the Appellant left Nigeria and in any event  indicated  at  best
    sporadic payment of  monies  over  the  years.   Furthermore  the  oral
    evidence was contradictory.  The Appellant said that the last  time  he
    received money from the Sponsor was in January 2009  and  when  it  was
    pointed out to him that there had been a fourteen month gap he  changed
    his account and said he must have received the money  after  that  date
    but could not remember.  The Sponsor said  that  he  paid  money  every
    month to the Appellant in Nigeria until 2010  but  could  not  remember
    exactly when.

19. The independent documentary evidence before the judge is not supportive
    of the  statement  in  the  affidavit  that  Victor  Idahosa  has  been
    responsible for  the  Appellant's  upbringing  to  date  and  the  oral
    evidence was wholly discrepant. The judge was  entitled  to  reach  the
    conclusion which he did.

20. The Appellant now argues that the judge failed to take into account the
    affidavits from the Appellant's mother.  The first affidavit  is  dated
    4th January 2010 and states that the Appellant is presently  under  the
    custody of his uncle, Victor Idahosa in the  UK.   Mrs  Pettersen  said
    that this was clearly wrong because at that point the Appellant was  in
    Nigeria.  Mr Cole said that this was  a  misreading  of  the  affidavit
    which simply meant that Victor Idahosa is in the UK.

21. The second affidavit, dated July 2011 states that after  the  death  of
    the Appellant's  father  Victor  Idahosa  has  been  his  guardian  and
    responsible for his upbringing to date.

22. The judge was not obliged to make specific reference to each and  every
    piece of evidence.  He said at paragraph 11 of the  determination  that
    he had taken into account  all  of  the  documents  submitted  by  both
    parties.  Given the discrepancies in the evidence between  the  Sponsor
    and the Appellant and the ambivalent nature of the affidavits from  the
    Appellant's mother the lack of specific reference to them is not  fatal
    to this determination.

23. With respect to the Appellant's situation since he has been in  the  UK
    the judge did not apply the wrong legal test.  Whether the Sponsor  was
    able to maintain the Appellant, given that  he  has  a  wife  and  four
    children to support is a relevant consideration as to whether he was in
    fact doing so. On the basis of  the  evidence  which  the  Sponsor  had
    produced, his income was limited.  The Tribunal in Reyes held that  the
    mere fact that a person is in the UK without lawful permission to  work
    does not mean that he is to  be  considered  as  meeting  the  test  of
    dependency under the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006.   There  is
    nothing irrational in the judge failing to find  as  a  fact  that  the
    Appellant is dependent on the Sponsor.

24. The judge was clearly entitled to place significant weight on the  fact
    that when the Appellant came to the UK he did not go and stay with  his
    uncle but instead went to live with one of his father's  relatives  who
    had sponsored him on his visit visa.  The Sponsor denied that this  was
    the case and said that he could remember the Appellant phoning him when
    he arrived from Nigeria at  Manchester  Airport  and  getting  a  train
    direct from there to the Sponsor's house.  He had no knowledge  of  the
    Appellant supposedly living with another  person  from  April  to  June
    2010.

25. Not only does the discrepancy cast light upon the  reliability  of  the
    witness evidence as a whole, it also tends to show, assuming  that  the
    Appellant is correct as to where he stayed when he first came to the UK
    that his relationship with the Sponsor is not that which he now  claims
    it to be.

26. Neither was it irrational for the judge to comment that  there  was  no
    reliable independent documentary evidence to show  that  the  Appellant
    was or is a part of the Sponsor's household.   Had  the  oral  evidence
    been consistent and credible such documentary evidence would  not  have
    been necessary. However in these circumstances, where it was  not,  the
    judge was fully entitled to comment on the fact that  it  was  lacking.
    It is not true to state that the Appellant could not have provided  any
    such documentation.  He could have registered with a GP,  or  opened  a
    bank account or even have produced correspondence addressed to  him  at
    his uncle's address.

27. The final challenge has more merit.  It may  be  that  the  judge  went
    beyond what the evidence could  bear  in  stating  that  there  was  no
    adequate evidence of when the Sponsor acquired  EEA  nationality  since
    there was evidence to show that, at the least he had an ID card  issued
    in January 2010  which  was  before  the  Appellant  came  to  the  UK.
    However, given  his  other  findings,  any  error  in  respect  of  the
    Sponsor's acquisition of German citizenship is immaterial.

28. Taken as  a  whole  this  is  a  sustainable  determination.   Had  the
    reasoning been fuller it may have been less open to challenge  but  the
    grounds disclose no error of law.

Decision

29. The judge's decision shall stand.  The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.
