                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of a  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ('the Judge') sent to the parties on 4 December 2019 by  which
    the appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent to refuse
    to grant her leave to remain on human rights grounds was refused.

 2. By a decision dated 27 July 2020 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Finch  granted
    permission to appeal on all grounds.

Hearing

 3. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
    held during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing  room  at
    Field House. The hearing room and the building were open to the public.
    The hearing and its start time were listed in the  cause  list.  I  was
    addressed by the representatives in the same way as if we were together
    in the hearing room. I am satisfied: that this constituted a hearing in
    open court; that the open justice principle has been secured;  that  no
    party has been prejudiced; and that, insofar  as  there  has  been  any
    restriction on a right or interest, it is justified  as  necessary  and
    proportionate.

 4. The appellant and her father attended the hearing remotely.

Anonymity

 5. The Judge issued an anonymity direction. Neither party sought  for  the
    direction to be set aside, and so I confirm it  at  the  conclusion  of
    this decision. I do so in order to avoid a likelihood of  serious  harm
    arising to the appellant from the contents of her  human  rights  claim
    becoming publicly known, particularly as her stated history  of  sexual
    intimidation and/or abuse remains to be considered.

Background

 6. The appellant is a national of Mauritius. She is presently aged 21.

 7. She entered the United Kingdom with entry clearance as a visitor on  19
    November 2016, when aged 17. She was granted leave  to  enter  for  six
    months.

 8. On 21 March 2017 she applied for indefinite leave to remain outside the
    Immigration Rules ('the Rules'),  relying  upon  article  8  ECHR.  The
    appellant did not  request  that  the  respondent  undertake  expedited
    consideration of  her  application.  An  accompanying  covering  letter
    authored by her present legal representatives simply detailed as to the
    substance of the application:

         'Our client is currently living under [sic] the same household  as:
         a) father, b) step-mother (British national), c) siblings  (British
         national). Our client's father submits he has  sole  responsibility
         of her. Further, he is actively involved in our  client's  life  by
         taking key decisions in her education and  health.  You  will  note
         that our client is a minor'

 9. The appellant relied upon her family  life  with  her  father  in  this
    country, detailing in bald terms that he had  sole  responsibility  for
    her consequent to his divorce from her mother. No representations  were
    made on her behalf as to fears of returning to  Mauritius  or  personal
    health concerns.

10. The application  was  made  a  little  under  three  weeks  before  the
    appellant's 18th birthday. As the application was made outside  of  the
    Rules, she did not enjoy the benefit of any subsequent  decision  being
    linked to her age at the date of application.

11. By a letter dated 11 September 2017, the respondent requested that  the
    appellant provide further documentation. The  appellant  wrote  to  the
    respondent on 22 September 2017 requesting an  additional  14  days  in
    which to secure and provide  the  requested  documents.  The  appellant
    provided further documentary evidence, including her birth certificate,
    under cover of a letter authored by her present legal  representatives,
    and dated 10 October 2017, which simply detailed:

         'We  have  been  informed  that  [the   sponsor]   has   the   sole
         responsibility for  our  client  since  our  client's  parents  are
         divorced.  Further,  her  father  and  step-mother  are  the   ones
         supporting her.'

12. The appellant was aged 18 at the date of this letter.

13. The respondent refused the application by a decision dated  7  November
    2018, observing that the appellant was now an adult who had spent  most
    of her life living in Mauritius. It  was  noted  for  the  purposes  of
    article 8 that relationships  between  an  adult  applicant  and  their
    father did not constitute  family  life  without  evidence  of  further
    elements of dependency that are beyond normal emotional ties, amounting
    to real, committed and effective support. Such ties were  said  not  to
    arise in this matter. The  respondent  concluded  that  no  exceptional
    circumstances arose.

Hearing Before the FTT

14. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at Taylor House on 5  November
    2019. The appellant and her father gave evidence.

15. The appellant filed a witness statement,  dated  13  June  2019,  which
    primarily adopted the contents of her father's first witness statement,
    save for detailing:

         'Further, I wish to explain why I did not reveal  my  circumstances
         to my father. I  felt  incredibly  ashamed  and  scared  about  the
         situation. Further, I did not know how my  father  would  react.  I
         confirm that my mother and I are no longer on speaking terms.'

16. By means of his first  witness  statement,  dated  13  June  2019,  the
    appellant's father  detailed  that  in  December  2016,  following  her
    arrival in this  country,  the  appellant  had  explained  to  him  the
    problems she was experiencing with her  mother's  partner  at  home  in
    Mauritius. He explained that consequent to this discussion  he  decided
    that she should make an application  to  remain  in  this  country.  He
    further detailed that he was concerned  as  to  his  daughter's  mental
    health because she had suffered several panic attacks and had  suicidal
    thoughts.

17. The appellant's father further detailed that the appellant  would  have
    no network of support in Mauritius on  return  and  though  she  is  an
    adult, she 'does not have any employment experience in Mauritius  since
    she came here as a minor'.

18. By means of a  supplementary  statement  dated  4  November  2019,  the
    appellant's father explained that the appellant could not register with
    a GP in this country consequent to her immigration status. He addressed
    his daughter's health concerns:

         'I went to Boots Pharmacy seeking help and explained to  them  that
         my daughter was struggling to sleep. Therefore,  I  purchased  some
         off-counter sleeping pills called Kalm which  she  has  been  using
         since then. Further, we prayed every day for her in  the  hope  she
         gets better. In brief,  I  did  not  know  how  to  deal  with  the
         situation other than speaking to her daily and praying.


         However, when she was really unwell, we went to a private GP  since
         each  consultation  costs  around  �50.00.  Due  to  our  financial
         constraints, we could not increase the number of visits for her  to
         see the doctor. On the 30 October 2019, she was very unwell  and  I
         took her to the doctor. At that stage, she broke down  and  the  GP
         became very concerned and advised us to seek  urgent  psychological
         help. Although I was advised by  my  legal  representative  that  a
         psychiatric report was required in the beginning I could not afford
         to get one done until recently.


         I also wish to clarify that I did not mention my daughter's medical
         circumstances before to the Home Office. The reason  is  because  I
         was not comfortable due to the stigma that will be attached to  her
         being a young Muslim girl. However, my partner  persuaded  me  that
         this is important for her case. Finally, I also  want  to  add  the
         bond my daughter shares with her two little brothers is very strong
         and that has helped her to cope with panic attacks at times.'

19. The Judge records the oral evidence of the appellant's  father  at  the
    hearing, at [15] of the decision, detailing:

         '15. In examination-in-chief, the Sponsor added  that  he  supports
            the  Appellant  by   providing   everything   for   her:   food,
            accommodation and anything else that she may need. The Appellant
            and her mother are no longer speaking to each other and there is
            no one available in Mauritius  to  look  after  her  there.  The
            Sponsor does have a brother in Mauritius, but he  is  busy  with
            his family and they are also not speaking to each other due to a
            dispute over their inheritance. The Sponsor  believes  that  the
            Appellant would not be able to work in Mauritius and she has not
            completed their education there either.'

20. The appellant relied upon a letter from Dr Gintaute Cukanoviene,  dated
    30 October 2019, detailing two visits by the appellant to  her  medical
    practice. The first visit was in July  2019  and  concerned  epigastric
    pain, periodic dizziness and 'sleepless' [sic].  The  second,  undated,
    visit is referenced as follows:

         'The second time  [the  sponsor]  worries  about  her  mood,  sleep
         disorder and her idea of suicide. During the our [sic] conversation
         I have been told that [the appellant] was waiting  visa  [sic]  and
         other additional documents for legal living [sic] in  UK.  It  took
         longer than a year. Leeding [sic] to, [sic] her  attending  to  the
         [sic] was  suspend  [sic]  a  year  ago,  the  patient  cannot  get
         registration with NHS service. [The appellant] distressed and  need
         [sic] psichlogical [sic] help.'

21. Reliance was also placed upon  a  psychiatric  report  authored  by  Dr
    Krishnapillai  Balasubramaniam,  consultant   psychiatrist,   dated   1
    November 2019. The length of the  consultation  is  not  detailed.  The
    report confirms Dr Balasubramaniam being informed by the appellant that
    she was present in Mauritius when she informed her  father  as  to  her
    problems and it was upon receiving this  information  that  her  father
    'made arrangements for her to visit him on a Visit Visa on 19  November
    2016'. The appellant informed Dr Balasubramaniam that since her arrival
    in this country she had been feeling depressed, with sleep  disturbance
    and suicidal thoughts. She was being treated with Alprazolam,  which  I
    observe is  commonly  prescribed  for  the  treatment  of  anxiety  and
    insomnia. Dr Balasubramaniam identifies it as an Anxiolytic, or a  drug
    used to relieve anxiety.

22.  Dr  Balasubramaniam  diagnosed  the  appellant  as  suffering  from  a
    Depressive Episode, of a severe degree as evidenced by  persistent  low
    mood, poor concentration, disturbed sleep,  feelings  of  hopelessness,
    helplessness and transient suicidal thoughts.

23. The Judge identified the appellant as advanced a  medical  health  case
    under article 3 and concluded at [22] - [26]:

         '22. I have no evidence from the Appellant or the  Sponsor  of  any
            self-harm to the Appellant or  any  risk  of  self-harm  in  the
            future.  I  have  regard  to  Dr  Balasubramanian's  psychiatric
            report, however I do not find the report to  be  persuasive.  On
            the strength of a consultation with the Appellant of unspecified
            duration, Dr  Balasubramanian  diagnosed  the  Appellant  to  be
            suffering from a depressive episode of  'a  severe  degree'  and
            that the Appellant has talked about jumping out of the  building
            and 'this risk is likely to increase if  attempts  are  made  to
            remove her from the UK'.


         23. On a holistic view of the evidence, I do not find the Appellant
            to meet  the  high  threshold  for  breach  of  Article  3.  The
            Appellant's current medical condition, in  my  view,  cannot  be
            argued to be sufficiently severe to engage  Article  3  and  the
            pertinent consideration is the risk on any removal.


         24. The Appellant is a  young  woman  who  clearly  has  the  love,
            affection and support of the Sponsor and I have no  evidence  to
            suggest that this will not or cannot continue  from  the  UK.  I
            find the Sponsor's and  the  Sponsor's  family's  support  could
            assist the Appellant minimising any risk that she  may  face  in
            Mauritius.


         25. Furthermore, I have no evidence to find  that  Mauritius  lacks
            the necessary medical services to assist the Appellant on return
            or that such services will not be available  to  the  Appellant,
            should be necessary.


         26.  On the totality of the evidence before me, I do not  find  the
            risk of self-harm to be sufficiently high to cross the Article 3
            threshold and, on the  lower  standard  of  proof,  I  find  the
            Appellant has not discharged the  burden  of  showing  that  the
            decision would lead to a breach of Article 3.'

24. I observe at this juncture that the appellant did not rely upon article
    3 in her notice of appeal, filed with the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  20
    November 2018. The Notice expressly stated  that  only  article  8  was
    relied upon in respect of the human rights appeal. Further, there is no
    reference to article 3 in the grounds of appeal filed with the  notice,
    nor is there  any  reference  in  the  record  of  proceedings  to  Mr.
    Rungasamy making  oral  submissions  as  to  article  3.  There  is  no
    reference to the appellant seeking to rely upon  article  3  as  a  new
    matter. I am unclear as to how the Judge  understood  there  to  be  an
    article 3 appeal before him.

25. The Judge determined that the appellant could not succeed on article  8
    grounds both under and outside of the Rules. He  took  the  appellant's
    case at its highest observing, inter alia, at [29]-[31]:

         '29. Taking the appellant's evidence at its highest, I accept  that
            the Appellant had  endured  difficulties  with  the  Appellant's
            parents separately and then the Appellant falling victim to  her
            mother's  new  partner's  inappropriate  behaviour  towards  the
            Appellant.


         30. However, the Appellant is now a young woman of 20 years of age,
            with some education at least, and the Appellant does not need to
            return to her mother. Indeed, it is the evidence before me  that
            the Appellant and her mother are no longer on talking terms. Any
            difficulties the Appellant may face on return, I  find,  can  be
            overcome with the support of the Appellant's father.


         31. Further, the  Appellant  clearly  has  experience  of  life  in
            Mauritius and can speak the national language and  I  find  that
            the Appellant would be able to build up a private life  back  in
            Mauritius and, on balance, the  Appellant  will  not  face  very
            significant obstacles to integrating into Mauritius.'

Grounds of Appeal

26. Two grounds of appeal are advanced:

         i. The Judge erred in not considering the impact of  delay  in  the
            assessment of  proportionality  in  respect  of  the  article  8
            appeal.


        ii. When considering  the  appellant's  medical  circumstances,  the
            Judge erred 'in not considering the level of  support  from  the
            father regarding the mental health of the appellant'.

Decision on Error of Law

Respondent's concession

27. At the outset of the hearing Mr. Clarke  confirmed  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent that  it  was  accepted  that  the  decision  of  the  Judge
    contained several material errors of law and so it  was  conceded  that
    the decision had to be set aside.

28. I observe that the material errors of law identified by Mr. Clarke were
    not those raised by the grounds of appeal.

29. Upon considering Mr. Clarke's  submissions  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    respondent was correct to concede  that  the  decision  should  be  set
    aside. I am further  satisfied  that  the  respondent  was  correct  to
    conclude that the grounds advanced by the appellant enjoyed no merits.

Date of consideration

30. Mr. Clarke identified two fundamental  failures  within  the  decision.
    Firstly, at [17] of the  decision  the  Judge  expressly  self-directed
    himself as to considering 'all of the evidence up to the  date  of  the
    decision'. Section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 confirms that on an appeal under section  82(1)  of  the  Act  the
    Tribunal may consider any  matter  which  it  thinks  relevant  to  the
    substance of the decision, including a matter arising after the date of
    decision. It is trite that in considering a human rights appeal,  where
    the evidence is not concerned with a new matter, a judge is to consider
    such evidence as is presented at the hearing and  to  consider  whether
    there  is  an  interference  with  protected  human  rights   and   the
    proportionality of the proposed interference at such time.  Mr.  Clarke
    was correct to observe that it is entirely unclear as to what 'date  of
    decision' the Judge is referring to, the respondent's or his own. I  am
    satisfied that such lack of clarity means that I cannot  be  sure  that
    the Judge correctly self-directed himself. Such failure is therefore  a
    material error of law.

Inadequate findings as to medical condition

31. Secondly, Mr. Clarke observed that the fact-finding exercise undertaken
    by the Judge was fatally flawed in respect of the  appellant's  health,
    and consequently there was inadequate  consideration  as  to  the  case
    being advanced by the appellant under article 8.

32. As observed above the Judge concluded at [22] that he did not find  the
    psychiatric report of Dr Balasubramanian to be persuasive. However,  it
    is entirely unclear as to whether reliance is or  is  not  then  placed
    upon the report when the Judge proceeds to  vaguely  observe  that  the
    appellant's 'current medical condition' is not sufficiently  severe  to
    engage article 3. It is entirely unclear as to which, if  any,  of  the
    several medical conditions referred to by the appellant are accepted as
    existing. The requirement to  be  clear  as  to  findings  of  fact  is
    exemplified in circumstances where one of the  complaints  advanced  is
    suicide ideation. Though  having  observed  above  that  there  was  no
    article 3 appeal before the Judge, I agree with Mr.  Clarke  that  such
    failure in the Judge's consideration of this  'ground'  then  adversely
    flowed into the subsequent  assessment  of  dependency,  including  the
    father's emotional support of the appellant, when  considering  article
    8: Kugathas v. Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2003]  EWCA
    Civ 31, [2003] I.N.L.R.  170.  The  article  8  decision  is  adversely
    infected consequent to such material error of law.

Appellant's grounds

Delay and article 8

33. I turn to the grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant. Ground  1
    is concerned with delay and proportionality.

34. I note that the appellant relied in both her grounds of appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal  and  in  her  submissions  to  the  Judge  upon  a
    purported delay by the respondent resulting in a  failure  to  consider
    her application whilst she was  a  minor.  The  record  of  proceedings
    detail Mr.  Rungasamy's  submission  that  a  different  outcome  would
    'probably' have been reached by the respondent if the  application  had
    been considered whilst the appellant was still a minor.

35. The appellant is understandably aggrieved that the submission was  only
    tangentially addressed at [37]:

         '37. I also take into consideration the Appellant's good character,
            the length of time spent in the UK to date, including the  delay
            by the Respondent in deciding the  Appellant's  application  and
            the difficulties the Appellant may face on return to Mauritius.'

36. However, upon detailed examination no material error of law arises.  At
    the date of application, the appellant was aged 17 years, 347 days. Her
    18th  birthday  fell  2  �  weeks  after  the  application.  Her  legal
    representatives made no request for expedition and, in any event, I can
    identify no true basis on the facts advanced in the application for the
    respondent being on notice  that  she  was  required  to  expedite  her
    consideration within such short period of time. I conclude  that  there
    is no reasonable or practical basis for  the  appellant  to  rationally
    believe that in the circumstances  the  respondent  unlawfully  delayed
    considering her application until after she reached her majority.

37. Further, once she turned 18 the fact that her father may, or  may  not,
    have enjoyed sole  responsibility  was  not  determinative.  Dependency
    would be considered in accordance with  the  principles  identified  in
    Kugathas.

38. At the hearing Mr. Rungasamy accepted that upon reflection there was no
    merit in this ground.

Medical health and article 8

39. In respect of ground 2 reliance is placed upon the head note in  Akhalu
    (health claim: ECHR article 8) [2013] UKUT 400 (IAC). The core  of  the
    challenge is detailed at �5:

         '5. It is submitted that the FTTJ erred in law in  not  considering
            the level of support from the father regarding the mental health
            of the appellant. Further  the  psychiatric  report  established
            that the support from her family network in the  United  Kingdom
            is an important factor in managing her mental health.'

40. There is no merit in the complaint that the Judge  failed  to  consider
    the level of support provided to the appellant by her father as to  her
    mental health. The submission advanced before the Judge  on  behalf  of
    the appellant focused upon the emotional support offered by the father,
    and the failing identified as to the  judicial  consideration  of  that
    submission is dealt with above.

41. As to the second limb of the ground,  there  is  no  challenge  by  the
    appellant  to  the  finding  that  Dr  Balasubramaniam's   report   was
    unpersuasive.  In  such  circumstances,  there  is  no  merit  to   the
    contention that the Judge was required to place weight  upon  the  very
    limited observation in the report as to the appellant being  'supported
    by her father and his Girl Friend [sic]'.  Consequently,  there  is  no
    merit to ground 2.

Preservation of individual findings of fact?

42. In setting aside the  Judge's  decision,  I  am  required  to  consider
    whether  it  is  appropriate  to  preserve  findings  of   fact.   Upon
    considering the material errors detailed above, I  conclude  that  they
    have adversely flowed into the decision-making process and consequently
    no findings of fact can be preserved.

43. However, there are a number of significant concerns in relation to  the
    approach adopted by  the  Judge  and  upon  careful  reflection  it  is
    appropriate that they are addressed by this Tribunal.

Inadequate fact finding

44. I am concerned that the Judge has  not  undertaken  an  adequate  fact-
    finding assessment in this matter and this in turn has led to  material
    errors of law as identified above.

45. The approach adopted by the Judge to fact-finding  varies  from  making
    no, or no clear, findings of fact at all when  erroneously  considering
    the matter under article 3 to simply considering the  appellant's  case
    'at its highest' when considering article 8.

46. The adoption of  the  former  course  led  to  the  erroneous  approach
    identified above, namely  the  identification  of  concern  as  to  the
    reliability of medical evidence, but then proceeding to accept that the
    appellant had a  'current  medical  condition'  without  providing  any
    reasoning for such acceptance or identifying the scope  and  nature  of
    such condition. Without making  a  clear  factual  finding  as  to  the
    appellant's  health,  the  Judge  could   not   properly   proceed   to
    appropriately apply the relevant  threshold,  whether  it  be  under  a
    mistaken understanding that article 3 was in play  or  in  relation  to
    article 8. Whilst ultimately  it  was  a  futile  consideration,  I  am
    satisfied that the approach adopted by the Judge at [23]  is  a  simple
    mechanical device solely utilised to refuse the article 3 claim without
    any true engagement with the evidence presented by the appellant.  Such
    approach should not properly be adopted.

47. The alternative approach adopted by the Judge was  to  simply  consider
    the appellant's case at its highest. Without more, this approach simply
    led to the Judge making generalised observations as to the  appellant's
    circumstances, as evidenced by the Judge  expressly  finding  that  the
    appellant has 'endured difficulties' with her parents  and  had  fallen
    victim to 'inappropriate behaviour' from her mother's present  partner.
    The scope and nature of  such  'difficulties'  and  the  'inappropriate
    behaviour' are not identified. The  parties,  and  anyone  reading  the
    decision,  are  required  to  proceed  on  the  assumption   that   the
    'inappropriate behaviour' found as a fact at [29] is that  detailed  in
    the June 2019 witness statement of the appellant's father, namely  that
    'a number of sexual advances' were made  towards  the  appellant.  Such
    evidence is vague in terms. There is no  finding  as  to  whether  such
    advances were verbal or physical, or whether  the  term  'inappropriate
    behaviour' is used to detail sexual harassment, assault or rape. Whilst
    it is for the appellant to advance her case,  it  is  for  a  judge  to
    consider whether the evidence presented is  sufficiently  detailed  and
    capable of meeting the requisite standard of proof.

48. The difficulty of adopting the crude approach of taking a case  at  its
    highest and making a general, positive finding of fact, is  that  there
    is no engagement with  discrepancies  and  inconsistencies  within  the
    evidence. The adoption of such approach can  usually  be  considered  a
    dereliction of the First-tier Tribunal's  fact-finding  function.  Both
    parties are entitled to expect adequate judicial consideration of their
    respective  cases  as  advanced  and  to  secure  appropriate  judicial
    undertaking of  the  fact-finding  exercise.  To  do  otherwise  is  an
    abdication of judicial responsibility.

49. I am satisfied that it is clear  from  considering  the  papers  placed
    before the Judge that there was a delay in the  appellant  raising  the
    issue of sexual impropriety at the hands of her mother's  partner  with
    the respondent. Such delay is addressed by the  appellant's  father  in
    his second witness statement. From this, it can be identified that  the
    appellant and her father were aware that such delay would be  an  issue
    to be addressed by the Tribunal and they sought  to  provide  a  cogent
    explanation. The Tribunal should have been aware that  this  issue  was
    first raised after the respondent's decision to  refuse  the  appellant
    leave to remain. It is an issue that both parties would  expect  to  be
    addressed by a fact-finding Tribunal in its decision. This is an  issue
    upon which a reasonable judge could decide in favour of one or other of
    the parties. However, if  a  judge  were  to  find  in  favour  of  the
    appellant on  this  point  the  respondent  could  legitimately  expect
    adequate reasons to be given for such decision. Simply taking the  case
    at  its  highest  and  making  a  favourable  general  finding  as   to
    credibility in favour of the  appellant  without  cogent  reasoning  is
    wholly inadequate in the circumstances.

50. Further there is an inconsistency between father  and  daughter  as  to
    when they first discussed the improper acts of  the  mother's  partner.
    The father states that he was only made aware of the true circumstances
    in December 2016, following his daughter's arrival in this country, and
    as  explained  in  his  June  2019  witness  statement  it   was   this
    conversation that resulted in him deciding his daughter should make  an
    application to  stay  in  this  country.  However,  Dr  Balasubramanian
    records in his report that he was informed by the  appellant  that  her
    discussion with her father was  conducted  while  she  was  present  in
    Mauritius and that consequent to such discussion  her  father  arranged
    for her to apply for a visit visa to  join  him  in  this  country.  No
    reasons are given by the Judge  as  to  why  such  inconsistency  could
    properly be overlooked. With regard to  an  important  element  of  the
    appellant's case, when there is clear inconsistency in evidence, it was
    wholly inappropriate for the Judge to proceed by taking the appellant's
    case at its highest, and to accept her stated personal history, without
    more.

51. The Judge should clearly have had in mind the  fact-finding  nature  of
    the First-tier Tribunal, which requires adequate consideration  of  the
    evidence presented  and  the  making  of  clear,  reasoned  conclusions
    referencing the evidence.  A  decision  should  clearly  identify  what
    central facts are accepted or not accepted, with adequate reasoning  so
    that the parties can understand the decision reached. There was a clear
    failure to  adopt  basic  fact-finding  requirements  in  this  matter.
    Consequently, the findings of fact cannot be preserved.

Delay

52. The appellant's reliance upon delay on the part of  the  respondent  is
    advanced outside of the Immigration Rules, and  so  she  is  ultimately
    required to establish that exceptional  circumstances  arise  from  her
    circumstances which place her in the small  class  of  cases  in  which
    leave to remain outside the Rules should properly be granted  in  order
    to avoid a breach of her article 8 rights.

53. In R. (Agyarko) v. Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2017]
    UKSC 11, [2017] 1 W.L.R.  823  the  Supreme  Court  observed  that  the
    Strasbourg Court has made clear that  Member  States  are  entitled  to
    control the entry of non-nationals, who should not  be  able  to  evade
    immigration control by establishing  a  family  life  while  unlawfully
    present. Observing the respondent's relevant instructions stating  that
    leave  could  be  granted   outside   the   Rules   where   exceptional
    circumstances applied which outweighed the public interest in  removal,
    the  Court  confirmed  that  this  involved  applying   the   test   of
    proportionality to each case. Such process is compatible  with  article
    8. As to delay, the Court observed at [52]:

         '52. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the cogency  of  the
            public interest in the removal of a  person  living  in  the  UK
            unlawfully is liable to diminish - or,  looking  at  the  matter
            from the  opposite  perspective,  the  weight  to  be  given  to
            precarious family life is liable to increase -  if  there  is  a
            protracted delay in the enforcement of immigration control. This
            point was made by Lord Bingham and Lord  Brown  of  Eaton-under-
            Heywood in EB  (Kosovo)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
            Department [2008] UKHL 41; [2009] AC 1159, paras 15 and  37.  It
            is also illustrated by the judgment of  the  European  court  in
            Jeunesse.'

54. I note the reference to 'protracted delay', which in its  normal  usage
    means something taking longer than expected.

55. In TZ (Pakistan) v. Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 1109, [2018] Imm AR 1301 the  Senior  President  of  Tribunals
    detailed, at [28]:

         '28. The  consideration  of  article  8  outside  the  Rules  is  a
            proportionality evaluation i.e. a  balance  of  public  interest
            factors. Some factors are heavily  weighted.  The  most  obvious
            example is the public policy in immigration control. The  weight
            depends on the legislative and factual context. Whether  someone
            is in the UK unlawfully or temporarily and the reason  for  that
            circumstance will affect the weight to be given  to  the  public
            interest in his or her removal and the weight  to  be  given  to
            family and/or private life (see the examples given in Agyarko at
            [51] and [52] which include the distinction between being in the
            UK unlawfully and  temporarily).  Decisions  such  as  those  in
            Chikwamba and EB (Kosovo) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
            Department [2008] UKHL 41, [2009] AC 1159 describe  examples  of
            how the weight or cogency of the public interest is affected. It
            is accordingly appropriate for the court  to  give  weight  when
            considering the proportionality of interference with  article  8
            outside of the Rules to factors that have been identified by the
            Strasbourg court, for example, the effect of  protracted  delay,
            the rights of a British partner who has always  lived  here  and
            whether it can reasonably be expected that s/he will follow  the
            removed person to keep their relationship intact:  that  is,  by
            way of example, the circumstances identified in EB  (Kosovo)  or
            the circumstance described in Chikwamba where the removal of  an
            appellant who is the  spouse  of  a  British  citizen  could  be
            followed by a right of re-entry.'

56. The consideration of  article  8  outside  the  Rules  is  therefore  a
    proportionality evaluation  involving  a  balance  of  public  interest
    factors in which some factors are heavily weighted,  the  most  obvious
    being the public policy in immigration control. I observe that the list
    of the circumstances to which the  Tribunal  can  give  weight  is  not
    closed. I further observe that the confirmation by the Court of  Appeal
    in Strbac v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA  Civ
    848, [2005] Imm. A.R. 504 that delay is not determinative it is  merely
    a relevant factor remains applicable.

57. The Judge appears to simply  have  accepted,  without  more,  that  the
    respondent delayed in the consideration of the appellant's application.
    Again, no reasoning is provided for what could be an important  finding
    of fact. Such approach as adopted by the Judge in this matter  is  very
    unfortunate.

58. In EB (Kosovo) v. Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2008]
    UKHL 41, [2009]  1  A.C.  1159  the  House  of  Lords  confirmed,  when
    considering circumstances concerning an asylum application, that  delay
    in the decision-making process might be relevant when  considering  the
    overall proportionality of ordering removal from this  country  in  any
    one of three ways. Firstly,  during  such  delay  the  applicant  might
    develop closer personal and social ties and establish deeper  roots  in
    the community than they could have shown earlier. The longer the period
    of the delay, the likelier that was to be true. To the extent that such
    circumstances are true, a claim under article 8  would  necessarily  be
    strengthened. The second way concerns the  impact  on  a  person  in  a
    relationship with the applicant, who enters the relationship aware that
    it is imbued with impermanence because the applicant enjoys  either  no
    status or limited status, but as months become years it can be expected
    that such sense of impermanence will fade and the expectation will grow
    that if the authorities had intended  to  remove  the  applicant,  they
    would have taken steps to do so. The third way delay may be relevant in
    reducing the weight otherwise to be accorded  to  the  requirements  of
    firm and fair immigration control, when considering the proportionality
    of removal, is to  establish  that  such  delay  is  the  result  of  a
    dysfunctional system that that yielded unpredictable, inconsistent  and
    unfair outcomes.

59. The appellant has not identified with any clarity,  either  before  the
    Judge or in the grounds of appeal before this Tribunal, as to which  of
    the three circumstances apply in this matter. The failure by the  Judge
    to seek an explanation at the hearing is a concern. I conclude from the
    appellant's case as generally advanced  that  the  second  circumstance
    identified in EB (Kosovo) does not  arise,  and  it  is  not  expressly
    asserted on her behalf that the purported delay was  the  result  of  a
    dysfunctional system. Consequently, the consideration is as to  whether
    such delay occurred that the appellant developed closer  personal  ties
    with her father and her family in this country,  than  she  could  have
    shown when the application was made 19 months earlier.

60. Consideration of article 8 calls for a broad and informed judgment  and
    is fact specific. What may be  protracted  delay  in  one  matter  upon
    consideration of its particular facts,  will  not  be  so  in  another.
    However, it was open to the Judge to consider the approach  adopted  in
    R. (M) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2014]  EWHC  159
    (Admin) in which the  High  Court  held  that  a  three-year  delay  in
    considering a matter was not  unlawful  delay  in  circumstances  where
    there were no factors at  that  time  which  should  have  led  to  the
    respondent,  acting   reasonably   and   fairly,   to   recognise   the
    inappropriateness of the ongoing delay.

61. In this  matter,  the  Judge  gave  no  express  consideration  to  the
    circumstances arising. He appears at [37] to have simply  accepted  the
    appellant's contention that the respondent had delayed  in  considering
    the application. The  Judge  gave  no  reasons  for  finding  that  the
    respondent taking 19 months from the date of application  on  21  March
    2017 to the date of decision on 7 November 2018 was sufficient to be  a
    'delay' that could be placed  in  the  proportionality  assessment.  No
    consideration was given to the appellant not  seeking  expedition  when
    making the application,  nor  as  to  the  respondent  writing  to  the
    appellant on 11 September 2017  seeking  further  documentary  evidence
    which was subsequently sent in response on 10 October 2017. No  express
    consideration was given as to whether over the 19 months the  appellant
    developed closer personal ties with her  father  than  she  could  have
    shown when the application was made. The lack of adequate reasoning  on
    a potentially important issue is stark. It is a clear  example  of  the
    inadequacy of adopting a 'take the case at its highest' approach to the
    fact-finding task.

Emotional support

62. On behalf of the appellant, Mr.  Rungasamy  relied  in  his  submission
    before the Judge upon the emotional support provided to  the  appellant
    by her father and expressly relied upon the judgment of  the  Court  of
    Appeal  in  Kugathas.  No  express  consideration  was  given  to  this
    submission by the Judge in his decision.

63.  Accompanying  the  father's  first  witness  statement  are  documents
    confirming his employment in this country. The wage slips evidence  his
    employment as a chef and relate to a period  of  approximately  a  year
    from July 2018. Their contents suggest his working between 31  and  104
    hours a week. The wage slips detailing fewer working hours identify the
    provision of holiday pay in those weeks. Of the  22  wage  slips  filed
    with the Tribunal, 17 are suggestive of the appellant's father  working
    70 or more hours during  a  week.  He  appears  to  be  an  industrious
    employee. However, being made aware by Mr. Rungasamy that the appellant
    may wish to rely upon this  submission  at  the  next  hearing,  it  is
    appropriate that the parties be  on  notice  that  whoever  hears  this
    appeal will wish to examine the nature and substance of  such  personal
    support in circumstances where documentary evidence suggests  that  the
    father is absent from the family home in the region of 80 to 100  hours
    a week, including travel time. The appellant will  be  aware  that  the
    burden of proof rests upon her and more  detailed  evidence  should  be
    presented as to the scope and nature of any support provided by  family
    members in this country.

Remittal

64. Both representatives before me agreed that this matter should  properly
    be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

65. Upon considering paragraph 7.2 of the Joint Practice Statement  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and  Upper  Tribunal  concerning  the  disposal  of
    appeals in this Tribunal I am satisfied that the effect of the  several
    material errors of law has been to deprive  the  appellant  of  a  fair
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal and so remittal  is  appropriate
    in this matter.

66. For the reasons detailed above, it is not appropriate for any  findings
    of fact to be preserved.


Notice of Decision

67. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and I set aside the Judge's decision promulgated on 4
    December 2019 pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunal, Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

68. This matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.
    No findings of fact are preserved.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

69. The anonymity direction issued by the First-tier Tribunal is  confirmed
    in the following terms:

         'Unless the Upper Tribunal or a court directs otherwise no report
         of these proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall
         directly or indirectly identify the appellant or her family
         members. This direction applies to, amongst others, the appellant
         and the respondent. Any failure to comply with this direction could
         give rise to contempt of court proceedings.'
