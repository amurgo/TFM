                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and the Respondents are referred to as the Claimants.

2.   The Claimants respectively born on 3 November 1976  and  29  June  1980
    are similarly citizens of Germany and the Cameroon and are husband  and
    wife.

3.   The Claimants applied for permanent  residence  under  the  Immigration
    (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  as  amended   (the   EEA
    Regulations) which were refused on 3 June 2014.  Their appeals  against
    the Secretary of State's  decisions  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hawden-Beal on 3 November 2014 and, having considered the  matter
    on the papers, the judge allowed their appeals.  The judge  found  that
    the Claimants had met all the requirements of Regulation  15(1)(a)  and
    (b) of the 2006 Regulations.

4.    Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge
    Wellesley-Cole on 14 January 2015.

5.   Before me it became apparent through the schedule of material that  had
    been  provided  to  the  judge  that  the  first  Claimant's   earnings
    significantly outstripped in all but the year 2014  the  threshold  for
    income support, housing benefit and any other state  benefit  to  which
    the first Claimant would have been entitled.  It is clear that  in  the
    year 2013 to 2014 (April to April) that the first Claimant  was  closer
    to the threshold but nevertheless, for the purposes of state  benefits,
    was self-sufficient.

6.   Thus, his actual outgoings are  not  material  to  the  requirement  of
    adequate funding to exceed, as  I  established  with  Mr  Nath  at  the
    outset, the statutory thresholds for income support or other  statutory
    benefits.

7.   Be that as it may, the fact was that the second Claimant  had  provided
    a contract of employment which showed her level of  earnings  being  in
    excess of ï¿½18,000 per annum and although that was not the  earnings  of
    the first Claimant, plainly they formed part of their common  pool  and
    family  pot  of  money  to  meet  the   family   outgoings.    In   the
    circumstances, it is unfortunate that the judge  did  not  recite  that
    aspect of the evidence because, had he or she done so, the position  is
    it is unlikely permission would have been granted.   Having  heard  the
    arguments, particularly from Mr Nath, who reiterated the point that  in
    order to assess sufficiency there needed to be a setting out of  income
    and outgoings to establish the Claimant had the  sufficient  resources.
    It is correct that the first Claimant did not do so  but,  as  Mr  Nath
    accepted, had the person settling the grounds seen the relevant  papers
    that had been submitted it would have been apparent that there  was  no
    purpose in labouring through an appeal in order to establish the  self-
    evident fact that there were earnings to show self sufficiency to which
    the judge made some reference in the decision.

8.   I am satisfied therefore on the evidence before the judge, even  if  it
    was not as efficiently set out as it could have been by him,  that  the
    first Claimant produced evidence sufficient to show  that  he  and  his
    wife,  the  second  Claimant,  both  of  whom  were  seeking  permanent
    residence, had the necessary funds to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

9.   In the circumstances therefore, whilst it may have  been  an  error  of
    law for the judge to fail to set out that consideration,  the  fact  is
    the failure to do so made no difference to or would make no  difference
    to the outcome on a re-making of the appeals.  In the circumstances,  I
    do not find it is necessary to carry out that exercise  and  ultimately
    Mr Nath left it for me; emphasising the general point that  a  schedule
    of income and outgoings would be the usual way the Secretary  of  State
    would expect to see evidence produced in such cases.

10.  I note the commonsense of that requirement but I also note  that  there
    is no requirement within the Regulations to produce  evidence  in  that
    fashion nor is any case law cited to me to show  that  that  should  be
    construed into an understanding of Regulation 15(1)(a) or (b).

11.  The Original Tribunal made no error of law.

NOTICE OF DECISION

12.  The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.

13   No anonymity direction is made.
