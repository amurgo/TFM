                             NOTICE OF DECISION

1. Both subparagraphs  of  rule  40(3)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
   Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) apply to this decision.
2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Roots)  sent  out  on  9
   December 2020 is erroneous in law.  I set it aside.
3. The appeal is remitted to be determined by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  de
   novo at an oral hearing  before  a  judge  other  than  Judge  Roots.  No
   findings are preserved
