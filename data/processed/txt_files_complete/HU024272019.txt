                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Bell, promulgated on 20th June 2019, following a hearing at  Birmingham
    Priory Courts on 11th June  2019.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of India, and was born on 15th  July
    1990.  He appealed against the decision of the  Respondent  dated  22nd
    January 2019, refusing his application for leave to remain in the UK as
    the partner of a person who was  settled  here.   The  application  was
    refused by the Respondent on the basis that the Appellant had submitted
    a TOEIC certificate from ETS, but this certificate had  been  cancelled
    by the ETS, who had undertaken to check on his test, and had  confirmed
    to the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State  that  there  was  significant
    evidence to conclude that it had been fraudulently obtained by the  use
    of a proxy test taker.  It was true that the Appellant claimed  to  now
    have a partner by the name of R K, but they were not married  and  they
    could not show that they had at least two years previous a relationship
    as partners.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that  the  Appellant  had  taken  the  English
    language test himself.  He had not cheated.  His wife could not  go  to
    live with him in India because  she  had  heart  problems  and  was  on
    warfarin and had a prosthetic heart valve.  He said  he  had  chosen  a
    particular college to do his English language test because the  college
    was affordable for him.  He did not take a receipt.   He  could  record
    that there were 23 or 25 people sitting the test and  he  did  not  see
    anyone cheating.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge dismissed the appeal on the basis  that  the  Respondent  had
    submitted that a ETS TOEIC test centre lookup  tool  document,  on  6th
    March 2013, at Queensway College, had found  that  98  tests  had  been
    taken of which 33 were found to be questionable  and  65  were  invalid
    (see paragraph 31).  The  judge  referred  to  "Project  Faï¿½ade"  which
    showed that there was "a high level of cheating" which was taking place
    (paragraph  35).   The  Appellant  had  to  put  forward  an   innocent
    explanation once the prima facie burden which lay on the  Secretary  of
    State had been discharged, and what had happened  here  was  that  "the
    Appellant simply asserts that he had not obtained the test by proxy and
    had gone to the test  centre  where  he  gave  test  and  obtained  the
    certificate and the allegation against  him  was  baseless"  (paragraph
    37).

 5. The judge recognised the Appellant's additional argument that "he  said
    he already had an IELTS certificate which he had  taken  in  India  two
    years prior to that date and had sufficient skill in  English  language
    to pass the test but his problem was that his certificate had  expired"
    (paragraph 37).   The  judge  reasoned  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    ambivalent about why he had chosen a particular college.  The Appellant
    was in a bind, "because the  Appellant  needed  to  get  a  certificate
    quickly and there was a two month waiting time" (paragraph  38).   That
    being the case, he had simply enlisted the help of an  imposter  to  do
    the test for him quickly, although the Appellant's case was  that  "his
    English ability was good enough  for  him  to  obtain  the  certificate
    without cheating" (paragraph 39).

 6. The judge, however, reasoned that, "I am satisfied that he had a  clear
    alternative incentive for needing to obtain a certificate through means
    of deception, which was that he needed a certificate  as  a  matter  of
    urgency.  As is said he, 'did not have the luxury of time'"  (paragraph
    39).

 7. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in his assessment
    of the Appellant's evidence concerning his taking of  an  ETS  test  in
    English and failed to apply the strictures in AA (Nigeria) [2010]  EWCA
    Civ 773.

 9. On 17th September 2019, permission to appeal was granted on  the  basis
    that it was argued that the judge failed to make clear findings on  the
    deception that the Appellant was alleged to  have  undertaken  when  he
    took the English test, especially given that he was a  person  who  had
    already passed a similar test before.  Secondly, it was  also  arguable
    that the judge's assessment of the Appellant's  Article  8  appeal  was
    lacking in detailed findings.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 5th December 2019, Mr Samra,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, submitted that the judge erred particularly at
    paragraph 38 of the determination in  concluding  that,  "he  said  the
    advisor chose the  college  because  the  Appellant  needed  to  get  a
    certificate quickly and there was a two month waiting time"  (paragraph
    38), because the delay of two months here was for a IELTS test, and not
    for a TOEIC test, which the Appellant had in  fact  already  taken  two
    years previously in India, and this had never been contested as  having
    been fraudulently procured.

11. Secondly, he submitted that insofar as it was helpful,  there  was  now
    postdecision evidence, which he  wished  to  submit,  and  this  was  a
    certificate from the Trinity College  London,  which  showed  that  the
    Appellant had since the hearing taken a ISE test in Birmingham on  13th
    November 2019 and had passed all the four skills in  reading,  writing,
    speaking and listening.  These results, submitted Mr Samra, showed  the
    Appellant performing at an even higher level than in his previous TOEIC
    test.

12.  There was, it is submitted, a third reason why  the  decision  of  the
    judge was unsustainable.  This was the  fact  that  the  Appellant  had
    stated in his witness statement (at paragraphs 15 to 17) exactly how he
    had travelled to the test centre, what  bus  he  had  taken,  what  the
    duration of time travel  was,  and  none  of  this  had  actually  been
    evaluated by the judge, particularly when the judge had concluded  that
    the Appellant, who had already previously passed  an  English  language
    test now  had  a  "clear  alternative  incentive"  (paragraph  39)  for
    cheating.  Before such a conclusion could be arrived at, the judge  had
    to consider the Appellant's account as to how he went to take the test.



13. Indeed, the Appellant had even gone on  to  explain  that  his  ID  was
    checked before he could enter the building (see paragraph 17) and  that
    the test he took at the building was  on  a  computer  (paragraph  18).
    None of this has been assessed by the  judge.   Moreover,  the  judge's
    conclusion that, "I also find it wholly unsatisfactory that there is no
    paper trail relating to the  Appellant's  dealings  with  the  advisor"
    (paragraph 39) was not justifiable given that the paper trail that  the
    judge was asking for was now some six years old, and the Appellant  was
    not likely to have kept any of the documentation from  that  time.   It
    may  have  been  desirable  for  the  Appellant  to  have   kept   some
    documentation but to conclude that his failure to  do  so  was  "wholly
    unsatisfactory" was unwarranted when it  is  borne  in  mind  that  the
    burden of proof was fundamentally upon the Secretary of State and  that
    all the Appellant had to do was to furnish an innocent explanation.

14. For her part, Mrs Aboni submitted that the judge had  dealt  adequately
    with the issue of the Appellant taking  an  TOEIC  test  previously  in
    India (at paragraph 37) but this had now lapsed after two years,  which
    meant that he was absolutely now required to have a new test completed.
     Second, the judge does focus on the relevant test  (at  paragraph  31)
    when he notes that it was taken "at Queensway College" where  98  tests
    had been taken and 65 had been declared invalid.  Third, the fact  that
    there was no paper  trail,  and  that  the  Appellant  could  not  even
    remember the name of the advisor that he had  enlisted,  was  a  matter
    that the judge could properly draw attention  to  (and  Mr  Samra  here
    appeared to accept  that  there  were  problems  with  the  Appellant's
    account in this regard even though he submitted that this was not fatal
    to the merits of his claim).  Finally, submitted Mrs Aboni,  the  judge
    was right to have concluded that "the Appellant  has  not  provided  an
    innocent explanation in response to the evidence of deception relied on
    by the Respondent" (paragraph 40).

15. In reply, Mr Samra submitted that there were no clear findings  on  the
    Appellant having exercised deception.  There was no  reference  to  the
    explanation he had given of how he took the test at paragraphs 15 to 17
    of his witness statement because these matters  have  simply  not  been
    evaluated by the judge.  There were no clear findings  in  relation  to
    the Appellant previously having done an IELTS test in India.   Finally,
    Mr Samra submitted that the Secretary of State could  have  produced  a
    recording to demonstrate, in the light of the fact that  all  that  was
    presented was generic evidence, that it  was  being  alleged  that  the
    Appellant cheated by using an imposter.

Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the decision of the judge did involve the making of
    an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007) such that I
    should set aside the decision.  My reasons are as follows.  This was  a
    case where the Respondent Secretary of State was relying  upon  generic
    evidence in relation to an allegation that the Appellant had  exercised
    deception in an English language test certificate that he purported  to
    rely upon.  It was also a  case  where  the  Appellant  previously  did
    undertake a TOEIC test in India two years previously which had expired.
     In the circumstances, it was incumbent upon the decision maker to have
    regard to the Appellant's explanation, when considering whether he  had
    been able to furnish an innocent account, about how he  went  and  took
    the test in question.  The Appellant details this at paragraphs  15  to
    20 of his witness statement, but these matters are not addressed by the
    judge.  The Appellant gave evidence at the hearing in  English  without
    the assistance of an interpreter.  There is no  recording  produced  by
    the Secretary of State to demonstrate that the Appellant had engaged in
    cheating.  All that the Appellant has to do is to provide  a  "innocent
    explanation" and that explanation could only have been  rejected  after
    looking at the evidence that he  gave  in  his  witness  statement  and
    properly factoring in the existence of a previous English language test
    that the Appellant had already passed in India  when  he  undertook  an
    IELTS certificate two years previously.   This  is  a  case  where  the
    strictures of AA (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA Civ 773 have not  been  properly
    applied.

Notice of Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined  by  a  judge
    other than Judge Bell, pursuant to Practice  Statement  7.2(b)  because
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact-finding which is necessary in
    order for the decision in the appeal to be remade is such that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in Rule  2,  it  is  appropriate  to
    remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

18. Anonymity direction is made.

19. This appeal is allowed.
