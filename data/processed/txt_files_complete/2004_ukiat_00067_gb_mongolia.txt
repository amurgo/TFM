Representation
For the appellant/Secretary of State:   Mr S. Halliday,
                                  Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent/claimant:      Mr R. O'Ryan, counsel

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The Secretary  of  State  appeals  against  the  determination  of  an
      adjudicator, Mr DJ Hubball, allowing the claimant's  appeal  on  human
      rights grounds against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to
      refuse both the claimant's asylum and human rights claims.


   2. The claimant is a citizen of Mongolia and was born on 8 November 1973.
       She is 30  years  old.   She  entered  the  United  Kingdom  avoiding
      immigration controls and claimed  asylum  on  3  November  2001.   The
      Secretary of State refused her claim and made a decision on  24  April
      2003, giving rise to a right of appeal under section  82  (1)  of  the
      Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.   The  claimant  duly
      appealed.


   3. The claimant was born in Mongolia of a Chinese father and a  Mongolian
      mother.  She went to university in Mongolia but claimed, as  a  result
      of her mixed ethnicity, she was discriminated against.  She married  a
      Mongolian whose parents strongly disapproved of  her  because  of  her
      mixed  blood.   In  particular,  her  father-in-law  was  violent  and
      abusive.  On  15  April  2000  the  family  home  was  burnt  down  in
      suspicious circumstances and the family decided to leave Mongolia.


   4. The adjudicator found that the appellant's father-in-law was a man  of
      some local influence but was not responsible for  the  destruction  of
      the claimant's family home. He did not find  that  the  discrimination
      and ill-treatment complained of by the claimant crossed the  threshold
      of severity into persecution, even taken cumulatively;  see  paragraph
      31 of the determination.  There is no appeal against that finding.


   5. The adjudicator found, however that the claimant and her husband  left
      Mongolia illegally.  In a statement signed by the claimant on  3  July
      2003, found beginning at page 4 in the Tribunal's bundle, the claimant
      said in paragraph 21:


      "The Mongolia Criminal Law states that if a person  leaves  or  enters
      Mongolia illegally then that person can be sentenced  to  imprisonment
      for up to five years.  I am therefore afraid that both my husband  and
      myself will be arrested and put in prison as we  used  illegal  travel
      documents to leave the country."


   6. The claimant's husband also made a statement on the same day in  which
      he said in paragraph 18:


      "We also left Mongolia illegally.  If we are returned we will be asked
      for a passport or travel documents.  When we  are  unable  to  produce
      them we will be detained.  The Mongolian Criminal Code states that the
      offence of illegal entry is punishable by up to five years in prison."


   7. Neither the claimant nor her husband are experts in the  criminal  law
      of Mongolia and it was therefore sensible to seek expert opinion  from
      a United Kingdom Mongolist to establish  the  likely  consequences  on
      return.  In a report prepared for the benefit of the  adjudicator,  Mr
      Alan J. K. Sanders provided an opinion on 11 July 2003.  On page 7  of
      the report, under the heading of Illegal Crossing of Mongolian Border,
      he stated:


      "Both the appellant and her husband point out that Mongolian  criminal
      law contains a penalty of five years  imprisonment  for  crossing  the
      border  illegally  (paragraphs  18  and  21  respectively).   The  new
      Mongolian Criminal Code, chapter 5, paragraphs 89.2,  says  that  this
      penalty applies for repeated  or  premeditated  actions  (but  is  not
      applicable to foreigners seeking refuge)."


   8. The adjudicator dealt with  this  material  in  paragraph  33  of  his
      determination:


      "On the evidence before me I accept that the appellant and her husband
      left Mongolia illegally.  I further note that Mr A. J. K. Sanders, the
      expert witness called on behalf of  the  appellant,  states  that  the
      Mongolian criminal code contains a penalty of five years  imprisonment
      for crossing the border illegally.  I find that there are  substantial
      grounds for believing that if returned to Mongolia now there is a real
      risk that the appellant and her husband would be imprisoned for up  to
      five years for leaving Mongolia illegally.  I further  find  that  the
      prison conditions in which the appellant  and  her  husband  would  be
      imprisoned are life-threatening, because of  insufficient  food,  heat
      and health care.  Further tuberculosis is endemic in Mongolian prisons
      and detention centres.  In these circumstances to return the appellant
      and her husband to Mongolia now, where it is  reasonably  likely  they
      would be subject to a long term of imprisonment, would  be  to  breach
      the protected rights of the appellant and her husband under Article  3
      of the ECHR.  Such imprisonment would constitute inhuman or  degrading
      treatment or punishment of the appellant and also  her  husband.   The
      life-threatening nature of prison conditions in Mongolia is  confirmed
      by the US State Department Report dated 31 March 2003 on  page  45  of
      the appellant's bundle."


   9. Accordingly, although the adjudicator dismissed the appeal  on  asylum
      grounds, he allowed the appeal under the ECHR.


  10. The Secretary of State appealed.  In the grounds of appeal  there  are
      two challenges made to the adjudicator's decision.  First, it is  said
      that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  before  the  adjudicator  to
      establish  the  reasonable  likelihood  that  the  claimant  would  be
      convicted or, if convicted,  sentenced  to  the  maximum  sentence  of
      imprisonment.  In particular, it  is  said  that  Mr  Sanders'  report
      failed to  demonstrate  that  this  legislation  is  enforced  by  the
      authorities.  The report does not  provide  any  examples  of  persons
      subjected to penalties on return for illegal exit.  Furthermore, there
      are no references in the  country  background  material  that  suggest
      failed asylum seekers are imprisoned on return  as  a  result  of  the
      circumstances in  which  they  departed  the  country.  Secondly,  the
      challenge is made to the adjudicator's finding that prison  conditions
      in Mongolia are sufficiently  poor  to  overcome  the  high  threshold
      required to breach Article 3.


  11. To be fair to the adjudicator, the adjudicator did not  state  in  the
      passage that we have set out about that the claimant was likely to  be
      sentenced to the maximum term.  Rather he said that they  were  likely
      to be imprisoned for up to five years.  Later, however, he found  that
      it would be a long term of imprisonment, without stating how  long  or
      his reason for so finding.

  12. For the purposes of this appeal, Mr Sanders was  asked  to  reconsider
      his report and he has produced an addendum in the form of two  letters
      dated 12 November 2003 and 1 December 2003.  These are found beginning
      at page 71 of the Tribunal's bundle.  At page 73, as an  Appendix,  Mr
      Sanders sets out Article 89 in full:


      "Article 89 Crossing of the Mongolian border illegally


      89.1.  The punishment for having crossed the Mongolia border illegally
      is a fine of 90 to 250 times the minimum  wage  or  imprisonment  from
      three to six months.


      89.2   If the offence is repeated or premeditated  the  punishment  is
      imprisonment for up to five years.


      [A Note adds that this does not apply to foreigners seeking refuge.]"


      Helpfully, he also sets out Article 22, although this is not  strictly
      material since this Article was not mentioned before  the  adjudicator
      whose determination was confined to the risk arising from Article  89,
      the illegal crossing of the Mongolian border.


      We only need refer to the following sub-articles:


      Article 22.2.


      Persons whose acts violate the following regulations for crossing  the
      state border are called border violators:


              2. Persons who cross or  are  preparing  to  cross  the  state
                 border at a designated crossing point with documents  which
                 are not valid for crossing the border.


      (The Tribunal infers that border violators are subject  to  penalties,
      although we are not told what they are.)


  13. It is a matter of  construction  whether  the  statute  prohibits  the
      illegal crossing out of the country as well as  the  illegal  crossing
      into the country.  Since it is normally the concern of  the  state  to
      prohibit unlawful entrants it is clear that it is directed at  illegal
      entrants.  Indeed, the express reference to the statute  not  applying
      to  foreigners  seeking  refuge,  demonstrates  that   some   entrants
      (refugees) are expressly excluded from the prohibition.   It  is  less
      clear that the statute is directed against  those  leaving  unlawfully
      since (save in the case of  highly  repressive  states,  such  as  the
      former Soviet Union) the state does not normally have much interest in
      those who wish to depart.   The  words,  however,  are  sufficient  to
      prohibit exit but there might well have  to  be  found  an  obligation
      (implied or explicit) that Mongolian citizens  should  not  leave  the
      country without  permission  or  unless  suitably  documented.   These
      considerations are academic because the  Tribunal  cannot  provide  an
      authoritative interpretation of the Mongolian Criminal Code; only  the
      national courts of Mongolia can do that.  It is for this  reason  that
      we turn to the  evidence  as  to  how  the  legislation  is  put  into
      practice.  For these  purposes  we  assume  that  the  legislation  is
      capable of creating a criminal offence of leaving the country  without
      holding a valid Mongolian passport.


  14. Our first consideration is the risk of prosecution.  In assessing  the
      risk on return to Mongolia, we  accept  that  the  government  of  the
      United Kingdom does not return citizens of another  country  to  their
      country of origin, or elsewhere, unless  they  are  in  possession  of
      valid travel documents, either in  the  form  of  their  own  national
      passport or in the form of emergency travel  documents  acceptable  to
      the receiving state.   Indeed,  this  is  common  sense  since  to  do
      otherwise would result in the  returnees  being  turned  back  at  the
      border or airport.  Consequently, we are satisfied that  the  claimant
      is not a risk of prosecution by reason only of the claimant's  arrival
      in Mongolia without her own passport.

  15. This leaves open whether there is a  reasonable  likelihood  that  the
      claimant will be prosecuted for the manner in which she left Mongolia.
       As Mr O'Ryan, who appeared  on  behalf  of  the  claimant,  correctly
      submitted, the fact that the claimant will not return in possession of
      her  own  national  passport  will  raise  a  suspicion  as   to   the
      circumstances in which she left.  Most states do not keep a record  of
      departure for their citizens.  Consequently, the Mongolian authorities
      are unlikely to  know  when  or  where  the  claimant  left  Mongolia.
      Furthermore, the fact that one  of  its  citizens  returns  without  a
      national passport does not establish a breach of  emigration  control:
      the returnee may have lost her passport or it may  have  been  stolen.
      Indeed, it may have been destroyed by her.  Applying normal principles
      of criminal law, whilst the returnee without her own passport will  be
      under suspicion, there  is  unlikely  to  be  sufficient  evidence  to
      establish a breach of the criminal law.

  16. Even if there were sufficient evidence,  the  Tribunal  needs  to  the
      satisfied that there is sufficient  evidence  that  a  prosecution  is
      likely to occur in the circumstances we  envisage  on  the  claimant's
      return.  Mr Sanders, in his letter of 1 December 2003, sets out  that,
      while checking on political events in Mongolia  in  2000,  he  noticed
      that in 1999 and 2000 Mongolian newspapers paid quite  are  a  lot  of
      attention to border issues, especially alcohol  smuggling  across  the
      land border with China and livestock rustling across the  land  border
      with Russia.  In most cases, he said, the border troops were  reported
      to have detained border violators, usually Chinese smugglers and Tuvan
      rustlers for criminal investigation.  He noticed 42 front-page reports
      of this kind in 1999 and 71 reports in 2000.   He  gave  two  specific
      examples.  Twelve Mongols were returned from Korea on the same  flight
      as they entered, having been refused leave to enter because it was not
      clear what work they would be doing in the Republic of  Korea.   Three
      of the people who were returned  to  Mongolia  were  detained  by  the
      border troops for  investigation.   Secondly,  a  Mongol  citizen  was
      arrested on the border crossing with  China  for  having  removed  the
      photograph in the passport of  someone  else  and  inserting  his  own
      photograph which he then presented as genuine in an attempt  to  cross
      the border.


  17. These reports fall short of stating that  any  prosecutions  followed.
      There is, therefore, no  evidence  that  those  detained  subsequently
      appeared in court, were convicted and sentenced.   Furthermore,  cases
      of alcohol smuggling and cattle rustling are very different  in  their
      nature.  Similarly, producing or using  forged  documents  may  be  an
      offence under Article 22 but  is  not  necessarily  an  offence  under
      Article 89. In our judgment, there  is  no  evidence  as  to  how  the
      Mongolian authorities view those returning to their  country  carrying
      emergency travel documents. More specifically, there is no evidence of
      any prosecutions.

  18. The adjudicator only had before him an incomplete portion  of  Article
      89. In the report before the adjudicator, it was a misleading omission
      to make reference to Article 89.2 without also  referring  to  Article
      89.1.  Article 89.1 provides that the penalty for  illegally  crossing
      the border is  a  fine  of  90  to  250  times  the  minimum  wage  or
      imprisonment from three to six months.  This is a  first  offence  for
      the claimant.  The offence took place 2� years ago.  89.2 provides for
      imprisonment for up to five  years  if  the  offence  is  repeated  or
      premeditated.  This suggests cases of a particularly serious nature or
      where there is, perhaps, a conspiracy.  The Tribunal is  not  able  to
      understand what it meant by "premeditated" in the context  of  leaving
      the  country  illegally  since  it  is  difficult  to   envisage   any
      circumstances in which the offence is not premeditated, unless  it  is
      where the accused was unaware that he was  crossing  the  border.   It
      follows that there is no evidence  that  the  claimant  is  likely  to
      receive a prison sentence at all, even if  prosecuted  and  convicted.
      Whilst the adjudicator was misled as to the availability of the lesser
      powers of sentencing, there  was  no  evidence  before  him  that  the
      claimant was going to receive the maximum sentence or a long sentence.
       In our judgment, in the absence of  any  evidence  as  to  the  usual
      tariff for such offences, he was not entitled to assume  that  prison,
      even on remand, was inevitable with an offence of this character,  far
      less that it would be long.


  19. The combination of the Tribunal now having sight of the lesser offence
      set out in Article 89.1 and the contents of Mr  Sanders  letter  of  1
      December 2003, (to  the  effect  that,  after  examination  of  border
      violations, there  is  no  evidence  that  failed  asylum-seekers  are
      prosecuted on return for the manner of their departure), leads  us  to
      the inevitable conclusion that the adjudicator was  in  error  in  his
      finding that the claimant faced a risk of prosecution  and  conviction
      and imprisonment. Accordingly, the Secretary of  State's  appeal  must
      succeed.




  20. Having so decided, we agreed with Mr O'Ryan's suggestion that  it  was
      unnecessary to consider the second issue  raised  in  the  grounds  of
      appeal, namely, the prison condition in Mongolia.  We expressly  avoid
      any finding as to whether the prison conditions  in  Mongolia  are  so
      poor as to engage Article 3 of the ECHR.  This issue was contested  by
      the Secretary of State in the grounds of  appeal  and  we  express  no
      opinion upon it.   We note that the Tribunal considered this issue  in
      Odkuu Ahmed [2002] UKIAT 06150.





Decision:  The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.
