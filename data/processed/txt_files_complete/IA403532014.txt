For the Respondent:    Mr David Mills, (HOPO)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Pirotta, promulgated  on  12th  March  2015,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 12th February 2015.  In the  determination,
    the Judge allowed the  appeal  of  Mr  Waqas  Siddique,  whereupon  the
    Secretary  of  State  subsequently  applied  for,  and   was   granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who was  born  on  29th
    March 1987.   He  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 26th August  2014,  refusing  the  Appellant's
    application to remain in the UK as the spouse of a person  present  and
    settled in the UK, namely, of Ms Siyka Khan, under paragraph R-LTRP  of
    Appendix FM.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant is a 27 year old Pakistani national who entered the UK on
    4th September 2012 with a  Tier  4  (General)  visa  valid  until  10th
    January 2014.  He then applied to remain  as  a  spouse  of  a  British
    citizen, Ms Siyka Khan, on 11th December 2013.  He was unable  to  meet
    the income threshold requirement, and accordingly, his application  was
    put on hold until the Court of  Appeal  decision.   The  Appellant  had
    submitted documents from the Sponsor's employers for three  months  and
    then additional documents to the effect that his Sponsor  wife  had  an
    annual income of �18,600 and payslips from November  2013  to  February
    2014.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The Judge held that the imposition of the �18,600 financial requirement
    by the Secretary of State was upheld by the Court of Appeal in the case
    of MM.  The Secretary of State had argued that the Appellant could  not
    succeed because he had submitted  evidence  that  his  sponsoring  wife
    earned �4,633 prior to the date of the application,  and  she  had  not
    been in employment for six months or more or earned the equivalent rate
    required for twelve months  prior  to  the  date  of  the  application.
    However, the Appellant and the Sponsor now had a child  and  the  Judge
    held that it would be unreasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom to live with the Appellant and his wife in Pakistan,  in
    circumstances where both the child and the sponsoring wife were British
    citizens.  The Judge had regard to FM-R-LTRP.1.1(d).   The  Judge  held
    that it was not  reasonable  to  expect  the  Appellant  to  return  to
    Pakistan to make an entry clearance application.  It was  further  held
    that this would  breach  the  Article  8  rights  of  all  the  parties
    involved, namely, the Appellant, his sponsoring wife, and their  child,
    in circumstances where they had a genuine and subsisting family life.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that the Judge's decision  amounts  to
    an error of law for three reasons.  First, the  Judge  gave  inadequate
    reasons at paragraph 15 that the financial  requirements  were  met  in
    compliance with Appendix FM-SE.  Second, the Judge had acknowledged  at
    paragraph 17 that the Sponsor failed to provide any evidence  regarding
    the financial circumstances.  Third, the Judge  failed  to  acknowledge
    that the Court of Appeal had in MM (Lebanon) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985
    confirmed that the imposition of the  financial  threshold  requirement
    was not a disproportionate interference with the family life.

 6. On 10th June 2015, permission to appeal  was  granted  on  the  grounds
    that, although the Judge concluded that the Appellant's child and  wife
    were British citizens, she failed to consider or  assess  the  relevant
    evidence and to give adequate reasons for  finding  that  it  would  be
    reasonable for the child to live with the Appellant  in  Pakistan.   In
    fact,  the  Judge  appears  to  have  not  found  that  the   financial
    requirements were met upon production of the specified evidence by  the
    Appellant.

Submissions

 7. At the hearing  before  me,  Mr  Mills,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of  State,  relied  upon  the  grounds  of  application.   He
    submitted  that  there  were  three  reasons  why  the   decision   was
    unsustainable made by the Immigration Judge.  First,  the  requirements
    of Appendix FM-SE were not met.  Second, the Judge had recognised  that
    the Sponsor had failed to provide evidence of financial  circumstances.
    Third, because of MM (Lebanon) plainly held that an interference by way
    of the imposition of the financial requirement was not disproportionate
    to the rights of the parties concerned.  Mr Mills went  on  to  explain
    that the Judge appears to have been swayed by the fact that a child had
    been born but there was no presumption that  where  there  is  a  child
    there is a disproportionate interference with that child's family  life
    by requiring the Appellant to return back home to make  an  application
    for entry clearance.  Facts have been found to that effect.  There  was
    no such finding by the Judge.  Indeed, the child was very young,  being
    born only in May 2014, and was aged only about 7 or  8  months  at  the
    date of the hearing.  The case of ZH (Tanzania) makes  it  quite  clear
    that there is no trump card in relation to the child  being  a  British
    citizen or having rights of residence.

 8. For her part, Ms Siyka Khan submitted that she was  a  British  citizen
    and was asthmatic.  Her child was also  asthmatic.   She  had  gone  to
    Pakistan the first time and had to return because of the seriousness of
    her asthmatic attacks.  All her family were in  the  UK.   Her  parents
    were in this country, her friends, and all her siblings, and she  could
    not realistically go to Pakistan.

Error of Law

 9. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  Judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.  First, the decision makes no reference to the  Supreme  Court
    judgment in Zoumbas [2013] UKSC 74, which makes  it  quite  clear  that
    where the children are particularly young (and they were much older  in
    that case than they are in the instant case), they  can  reasonably  be
    expected to have their "best interests" served perfectly adequately, if
    they accompany one parent or the other to the  country  abroad  for  an
    application to be made from there.  The Supreme Court  makes  it  quite
    clear that there is no presumption that the existence of young children
    necessarily makes the removal of a parent disproportionate.

10. Second, this was a case where the Appellant could  not  show  that  his
    sponsoring wife was able to earn �18,600 in the preceding six months or
    twelve months prior to the application.  In fact, the contrary  appears
    to have been the case.

11. Third, the determination simply assumes that it would  be  unreasonable
    to expect the family to relocate  to  another  country  without  making
    findings of fact to that effect.  If it is the case that Ms Siyka Khan,
    is asthmatic, and so was their child, then clear findings  have  to  be
    made in relation to these matters.  This is not least because there are
    plenty of people with asthmatic conditions in the country like Pakistan
    and there is treatment available for this condition.  This was  a  case
    where the child was particularly young being some eight months  at  the
    date of the hearing, and is  still  young,  and  it  simply  cannot  be
    assumed,  that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  or  that  it  is
    unreasonable to expect the Appellant to return back to Pakistan.

12. Under Practice Statement 7.2 the Upper Tribunal may remit the  case  to
    the First-tier Tribunal where,

         "the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact-finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be  remade  is
         such that having regard to the overriding objective in Rule  2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier  Tribunal"  (see
         paragraph 7.2(b)).

    In my view, this is such a case.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law, such that it falls  to  be  set  aside.   I  set  aside  the
decision of the original  Immigration  Judge.   I  remake  the  decision  as
follows.  This appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed and  this  matter
is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal at  Sheldon  Court,  Birmingham,
to be heard by a Judge other than  Judge  Pirotta,  at  the  next  available
date.

No anonymity direction is made.
