For the Respondent:    Mr O Jibowu, Counsel, instructed by M J Solomon &
Partners


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Respondent, who was  born  on  17  July  1988,  is  a  national  of
    Nigeria.  He entered as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant on 18  March
    2013 with leave to remain until 25  July  2014.   On  29  May  2014  he
    married his wife who he had already known from Nigeria.  She  had  been
    born in Nigeria but was granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom on 8 November 2012.  On  11  July  2014  the  Respondent
    applied for leave to remain as the partner of a person who  is  settled
    here.  This application was refused on 27 August 2014 on the basis that
    he did not meet the financial requirements within Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

2.   He appealed on 10 September 2014 and his first  ground  of  appeal  was
    that the decision was wrong in law as he was able to  demonstrate  that
    his wife had earned �367.57 per  week  consistently  for  three  months
    immediately preceding his application. His second ground of appeal  was
    that the refusal was an unlawful interference with his and  his  wife's
    private and family life.

3.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Hendry heard the case on 9 March 2015 and  on
    15 April 2015 he allowed the appeal. He took into account the  totality
    of the evidence  available  at  the  hearing  and  concluded  that  the
    Respondent's partner's projected annual income amounted to �19,122  and
    that, therefore, the Respondent was able to meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph E-LTRP.3.1. of Appendix FM.

4.   On 23 April 2015  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    appealed and on 18 June 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge  Holmes  granted
    permission to appeal on the basis that  the  Respondent  did  not  (and
    could not) produce the evidence  required  by  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  He  also  went  on  to  note  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had not considered Article  8  in  the  alternative  but
    noted that, if he had, he would have been obliged  to  apply  paragraph
    276ADE, ss117A-D and the guidance to be  found  in  AM  (s117B)  Malawi
    [2015] UKUT 260.

5.   The Home Office Presenting Officer noted that the Respondent's  partner
    only started working for the A(24) Group on 17th February 2014 and  for
    Emprise on 29th March 2014. Therefore, she had not been  in  employment
    for six months when the Respondent applied for leave to remain  as  her
    partner.  She  also  submitted  that  he  was  not  able  to  meet  the
    evidential requirements of paragraph 13(b) of Appendix FM-SE.

6.   Counsel for the Respondent then  replied  and  asserted  that,  as  the
    Respondent was entitled to an in-country right of  appeal,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge was able to take into account evidence  that  post-
    dated the Respondent's application. He also noted that  at  the  First-
    tier Tribunal hearing  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  had  not
    objected to  this  evidence  being  taken  into  account.  However,  at
    paragraph 29 of the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  decision  and  reasons
    the Home Office Presenting Officer  had  submitted  that  the  evidence
    provided did not satisfy the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE.  Counsel
    also argued that the First-tier Tribunal Judge could take into  account
    evidence which was for less than 12 months if the Respondent  was  able
    to meet the substance of the requirement. He also argued  that  as  the
    Respondent would  have  succeeded  under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights any error was not a material one.

7.   I accept that the Respondent did have a right to an in-county right  of
    appeal and that  Section 85(4)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 states that the Tribunal may consider any matter  which
    it thinks relevant to the substance of the decision, including a matter
    arising after the date of the decision.

8.   However, the Respondent had applied for leave to remain as the  partner
    of a person who was settled in the United Kingdom and,  therefore,  had
    to meet the financial requirements contained in  paragraph  E-LTRP.3.1.
    of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules which states that an  applicant
    must provide specified evidence from the sources listed in paragraph E-
    LTRP.3.2., which include the income of a partner  from  employment.  It
    also states that the applicant has to show  a  specified  gross  annual
    income of at least �18,600.

9.   Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules  outlines  the  nature  of  the
    specified evidence referred to in Appendix FM. In particular, paragraph
    13(b) of Appendix FM-SE explains  that  where  a  person  has  been  in
    employment for less than six months at the date of the application,  he
    or she had  to  provide  evidence  of  the  gross  annual  salary  from
    employment at the date of the application plus the gross amount of  any
    specified non-employment income or pension.

10.  Instead, the Respondent sought to rely upon evidence  from  before  and
    after the date of the application and had not  provided  the  necessary
    specified  evidence.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  looked  at  the
    evidence and calculations provided to him but did not remind himself of
    the relevant requirements of Appendix FM  and  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

11.  Counsel for the Respondent had  not  been  able  to  refer  me  to  any
    relevant case law but  in  paragraph  51  of  SS  (Congo)  &  Others  v
    Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department   [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387
    indicated that an applicant  had  to  meet  the  requirements  of  both
    Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE.

12.  Therefore, the failure by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  to  remind
    himself of the requirements of both Appendix FM and Appendix  FM-SE  of
    the Immigration Rules was an error  law.  Counsel  for  the  Respondent
    argued that it was not a material error of law, as he would  have  been
    able to show that if Article 8 of the ECHR  had  been  considered,  his
    appeal would have been allowed.

13.  However, the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not consider  Article  8  in
    the alternative and paragraph 33 of his decision and reasons  does  not
    indicate that the Respondent's counsel had addressed  him  on  relevant
    case law or the appropriate parts of Sections 117A-D. Therefore, it  is
    not the case that an alternative breach of Article 8  could  have  been
    successfully established.

14.  Therefore, I conclude that there was a material error  of  law  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision and reasons and that I must  allow
    the Secretary of State for the Home Department's appeal.

Notice of Decision

1.   The Secretary of State for the Home Department's appeal is allowed.

2.   The Respondent's appeal is remitted  to  a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Hendry for a de novo hearing.

3.   No anonymity direction is made.
