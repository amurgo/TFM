                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity order
Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) The Tribunal has ORDERED that no one shall publish  or  reveal
the name or address of M G who  is  the  subject  of  these  proceedings  or
publish or reveal any information which would  be  likely  to  lead  to  the
identification of him or of any member of  his  family  in  connection  with
these proceedings.

Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to  contempt  of
court proceedings.

Decision and reasons

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  against  her
    decision on 18 April 2019,  pursuant  to  section  40  of  the  British
    Nationality Act 1981, to deprive him of his British citizenship status,
    following his naturalisation as  a  British  citizen  in  2004  in  the
    identity of a Kosovan citizen, to  which  he  was  not  entitled.   The
    claimant is a citizen of Albania  and  has  never  been  a  citizen  of
    Kosovo.

 2. The claimant has not been prosecuted for his fraudulent  claim  between
    1998 and 2010 that he was a Kosovan citizen.  His  wife  and  daughters
    are British citizens.  Their nationality acquired  while  the  claimant
    was a British citizen, before the deprivation order, is  unaffected  by
    the claimant's fraud.

 3. There is at present no deportation order or removal  direction  seeking
    to remove the claimant to Albania.  His wife and  two  young  daughters
    have the right of abode in the United Kingdom.

 4. The First-tier Judge allowed the claimant's appeal against deprivation,
    on human rights grounds.  On 21 October 2019, I found a material  error
    of law in the decision of  the  First-tier  Judge  and  set  aside  the
    decision for remaking in the Upper Tribunal.

 5. The substantive remaking of the decision in this appeal  was  adjourned
    by consent of all parties, to await the decision of the Upper  Tribunal
    in Hysaj (Deprivation of Citizenship: Delay) Albania  [2020]  UKUT  128
    (IAC) (Hysaj [2020]) which applied the judgment of the Supreme Court in
    Hysaj & Ors, R (on the application of) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2017]  UKSC  82  (Hysaj  [2017])  and  considered  the
    circumstances in which delay  can  be  relevant  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's discretion to deprive a person of fraudulently acquired British
    citizenship.

Remote hearing

 6. This was a remote hearing, conducted by Skype  for  Business  with  the
    agreement of all parties.  A face to face hearing was not held  because
    it was not practicable and all relevant questions  for  this  adjourned
    hearing could be decided  in  a  remote  hearing.    The  claimant  was
    present remotely, as were both Counsel.

 7. There was  one  technical  issue:  Mr  Martin,  who  appeared  for  the
    claimant, was unable to get his computer video camera working, although
    he confirmed that he could see and hear  me  and  also  Mr  Clarke  who
    represented the Secretary of State.  Mr Martin said  that  he  did  not
    consider that he had been materially disadvantaged by  the  failure  of
    his computer camera and was content to proceed on that basis.

 8. The Upper Tribunal recorded the proceedings.  I remind the parties that
    pursuant to sections 85B and 85C of the Courts Act 2003, as amended  by
    the Coronavirus Act  2020,  it  is  a  criminal  offence  to  make  any
    unauthorised recording of the  proceedings,  either  through  Skype  or
    using any other equipment.

 9. I am satisfied  that  this  hearing  was  completed  fairly,  with  the
    cooperation of the parties.

Background

10. The claimant was born in Albania in February  1979.   He  came  to  the
    United Kingdom, in 1998, aged 19, posing as  an  unaccompanied  asylum-
    seeking child from Kosovo.  The claimant  was  a  single  man  with  no
    dependants.  He was neither a child nor a Kosovan citizen.

11. On 8 May 1999, he was granted asylum and indefinite leave to remain  in
    his Kosovan identity, on political grounds.  It is  important  to  note
    that the claimant did  not  use  the  identity  of  a  genuine  Kosovan
    citizen: the Kosovan nationality which qualified him for refugee status
    was entirely fictitious.

12. On 29 June 2004, the claimant was  naturalised  in  his  false  Kosovan
    identity, which made him both a British citizen and  an  EEA  national.
    That ended the claimant's refugee status because he had acquired a  new
    nationality, and  thereafter  enjoyed  the  protection  of  the  United
    Kingdom (see Article 1C(3) of  the  Refugee  Convention  and  paragraph
    339A(ii) of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended)).  Any child born
    to him while he was a British citizen acquired British  citizenship  by
    birth.

13. In November 2006, the claimant met an Albanian woman in London  and  in
    January 2007, he began a relationship with her.  In 2008, she  returned
    to live with her parents in Albania but the relationship  continued  by
    visits.

14. In 2009, they became engaged to be  married,  and  in  June  2010,  the
    claimant's partner applied for entry clearance to  join  him  here  for
    settlement.  She was then pregnant with their older daughter,  who  was
    born in September 2010 and is now 10 years old.

15. As part of the entry  clearance  application,  the  claimant's  partner
    disclosed the claimant's genuine  Albanian  birth  certificate  and  he
    admitted that his Kosovan identity  was  fictitious  and  that  he  had
    acquired British citizenship by fraud.  Entry clearance was refused  on
    4 October 2012, but allowed  on  appeal  on  22  August  2013.   On  24
    September 2013, the couple's second daughter was born.  She  is  now  7
    years old.  A fiancï¿½e visa was granted, but the claimant's partner  was
    able to make only a brief two day visit to the United Kingdom as  their
    daughters were still in Albania with her parents and did not  yet  have
    British passports on which to travel.

16. On 7 January 2014, the claimant was informed that, in the light of  his
    fraud, his  naturalisation  was  a  nullity.   In  December  2017,  the
    Secretary  of  State  conceded  in  the  Supreme  Court  that   British
    citizenship granted  by  naturalisation  on  fraudulent  grounds  in  a
    fictitious identity (rather than in the identity of a real person  with
    the relevant citizenship qualifications) was not properly characterised
    as a nullity. In such circumstances, a decision under section 40 of the
    British Nationality Act 1981 was required to deprive  him  formally  of
    his citizenship.

17. The claimant in his witness statement for his  wife's  entry  clearance
    appeal  stated  that  he  was  granted  a  biometric  residence  permit
    indicating that he was settled in the United  Kingdom,  valid  from  13
    December 2017 to 5 December 2019, and was able to travel to Albania and
    visit his partner  and  daughters,  who  were  still  living  with  his
    partner's parents.  On 19 January 2018, he married his partner and  she
    is now his wife.

18. The Secretary of State's 2014  nullity  decision  was  withdrawn  on  3
    February 2018. On 10 February 2018, just a week later, the Secretary of
    State gave notice of her intention to make a  deprivation  order  under
    section 40(3) of the 1981 Act. In April 2018, the claimant applied  for
    his daughters to be registered as British citizens and on  14  November
    2018, they were issued with British passports which would allow them to
    join him in the United Kingdom.

19. On 19 January 2019, the claimant's wife had  applied  again  for  entry
    clearance to join him in the United Kingdom with their  daughters,  who
    do not  need  entry  clearance  as  they  are  British  citizens.   The
    Secretary of State refused entry  clearance  but  the  claimant's  wife
    succeeded on appeal, and during the summer of  2019,  first  the  elder
    daughter, and then the younger daughter and the claimant's wife, joined
    him here.  The claimant's wife is now a British citizen.

20. The claimant and his solicitors  were  given  an  opportunity  to  make
    representations about the proposed deprivation order, which  Connaughts
    solicitors did.  On 27 February 2018, Connaughts wrote to the Secretary
    of State, expressing the claimant's regret  for  the  deception.   They
    accepted that he was the  author  of  his  own  misfortunes  but  asked
    whether he had not been sufficiently punished. The claimant  was  still
    waiting to begin his family life in the United Kingdom, as his wife and
    two daughters had not been permitted to join him.  For most of the time
    he had been in the United Kingdom, it was as a single man.

21. Connaughts argued that the period of citizenship  limbo  from  2010  to
    2018 was excessive, particularly as between January 2014  and  December
    2017, the claimant had been unable to leave the United Kingdom  because
    his British citizenship had been declared a nullity.

22. On 18 April 2019, the Secretary  of  State  made  a  deprivation  order
    pursuant to section 40(3) of the British  Nationality  Act  1981.   The
    Secretary of State's deprivation order relates  only  to  the  claimant
    himself: there has been no proposal to deprive his wife  and  daughters
    of their British citizen status.

23. The arguments in mitigation  raised  in  Connaughts'  submissions  were
    considered in the  Secretary  of  State's  deprivation  decision.   The
    Secretary of State did not consider that the  claimant's  loss  of  his
    British citizenship  and  the  associated  rights,  including  loss  of
    European  Union  citizenship,  were  sufficient  reason   to   exercise
    discretion in his favour and not deprive him of his  citizenship.   The
    Secretary of State considered that the claimant could  return  to  live
    and  work  in  Albania,  as  he  was  an  Albanian  citizen,  and   any
    interference with European Union citizenship rights was  proportionate,
    given the gravity of the fraud.

24. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

25. The claimant argued that the Secretary of State had failed to  exercise
    her discretion not to deprive the claimant of his British  citizenship:
    see Deprivation and nullity of British citizenship: nationality  policy
    guidance, published on 27 July 2018, and in particular Chapter 55.7  of
    the  Guidance.   The  claimant  argued  that  the  Guidance  said  that
    deprivation would not normally be appropriate where a person  had  been
    in the United Kingdom for more than 14 years.

26. On 31 July  2019,  First-tier  Judge  Baldwin  allowed  the  claimant's
    appeal, principally because  of  the  Secretary  of  State's  delay  in
    dealing with his citizenship issue, and his Article 8 ECHR private life
    human rights (excluding family life).

27. The First-tier Judge  noted  that  the  claimant's  two  daughters,  as
    British citizens, had the right to grow up in the United  Kingdom,  and
    that at the date of hearing, the elder was already with her  father  in
    the United Kingdom.  It would be in their section 55 best interests  to
    have both parents around and to  live  together  in  their  country  of
    nationality.

28. The claimant would be able to provide well for his family in the United
    Kingdom, as he had a good job, earning about ï¿½40,000 a  year,  and  his
    own house, with a mortgage, since 2007.  His wife  was  an  experienced
    hairdresser and would have no difficulty finding  work  in  the  United
    Kingdom if she wanted or needed it.

29. The judge allowed the linked human rights appeal of the claimant's wife
    against her continued exclusion  from  the  United  Kingdom,  on  human
    rights grounds (see HU/08358/2019).  The family finally united  in  the
    United Kingdom in the summer of 2019 and family life  has  existed  for
    just over a year now.  The wife's appeal against the refusal  of  entry
    clearance is no longer before this Tribunal.

30. The First-tier Judge allowed the claimant's appeal against  deprivation
    of citizenship, considering that the Secretary  of  State's  discretion
    had not been correctly exercised, given  her  initial  (now  erroneous)
    decision that his citizenship was a nullity, and her  delay  in  making
    the deprivation decision.   He also allowed the  claimant's  appeal  on
    human rights grounds: that was erroneous, as there was no human  rights
    appeal by the claimant before the First-tier Tribunal.

31. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

32. The grounds of appeal challenged the First-tier Judge's  decision  that
    the deprivation of citizenship was unlawful.  The  Secretary  of  State
    argued that the First-tier Judge had erred in equating a deprivation of
    citizenship decision to a removal or deportation decision.

33. The Secretary of State contended that deprivation of citizenship  would
    not prevent the claimant from being with, and caring for his  children,
    if permitted to do so and that if the Upper Tribunal were to substitute
    a decision dismissing the citizenship appeal, the claimant could  apply
    for leave to remain on human rights grounds by reference to  Article  8
    ECHR.

34. On 5 September 2019,  First-tier  Judge  Povey  granted  permission  to
    appeal on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal's decision  failed  to
    reason adequately why the Secretary  of  State's  decision  to  deprive
    breached the claimant's Article 8 ECHR private life rights, given  that
    no removal directions had yet been set; that the First-tier  Judge  had
    failed to  give  appropriate  and  significant  weight  to  the  public
    interest (see BA (deprivation  of  citizenship;  appeals)  [2018]  UKUT
    00085); and in particular, that the First-tier Tribunal placed too much
    weight on the Secretary of State's delay and too little weight  on  her
    decision to exercise discretion under section 40(3) of the 1981 Act.

Upper Tribunal proceedings

35. At a hearing on 21 October 2019 I found an error of law and  set  aside
    the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  for  remaking  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal decision in Hysaj [2020] was awaited.

36. Following the Hysaj decision, the Secretary of State confirmed that she
    maintained her challenge to the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  in
    these proceedings.  A substantive hearing listed  for  April  2020  was
    vacated during the COVID-19 pandemic.  There followed triage directions
    on 24 May 2020 and the appeal was then listed for substantive remaking.



37. That is the basis on which the appeal comes before the  Upper  Tribunal
    today.

Claimant's submissions

38. For the  claimant,  Mr  Martin  acknowledged  that  when  the  claimant
    revealed his fraud in 2010, he had not accrued 14 years'  residence  in
    the United Kingdom, but relied on the length of  residence  in  January
    2014, when the Secretary of State's nullity decision was made.

39. Mr Martin also accepted that  no  family  life  issue  arose  when  the
    deprivation decision was taken in January 2019,  because  the  claimant
    was then in the United Kingdom without  his  wife  and  children.   The
    provisions of part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 (as amended)  did  not  apply  to  this  appeal  to  discount  the
    claimant's private life established during that period.

40. Mr Martin conceded that in 2014, the Secretary of State was entitled to
    rely on the legal advice she would then have been given, and  that  her
    decision that the claimant's acquired British citizenship was a nullity
    was lawful at the  time.  However,  Mr  Martin  argued  that,  had  the
    Secretary of State applied what she later acknowledged in  the  Supreme
    Court to be the proper approach, the claimant would have  been  granted
    indefinite leave in her letter of January 2014, on  the  basis  of  his
    long residence. The Secretary of State's decision  was  retrospectively
    erroneous, and she ought in January 2014 to have decided not to deprive
    the claimant of his British citizenship.

41. Mr Martin submitted that more than just nationality fraud was  required
    for the 2019 deprivation order to have been lawfully made: there was no
    other adverse conduct, the claimant having worked continuously while in
    the United Kingdom, paid his mortgage and his taxes, and stayed out  of
    trouble with the police.  The claimant had a legitimate expectation  to
    be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom, and his  right  to  private
    life in the United Kingdom under Article 8 ECHR was breached  for  that
    reason.

42. Mr Martin sought to argue that in the light of the interruption  of  Mr
    Hysaj's residence by a 5-year sentence  of  imprisonment,  for  serious
    offences, his case should be distinguished from that of this  claimant.
    The balancing act carried out in relation to Mr Hysaj was based on  the
    particular facts of his appeal.

43. Under Article 8 ECHR, the claimant would rely on the limbo in which  he
    had found himself between 2010 and 2019, and on EB  (Kosovo)  at  [14]-
    [15].  The effect on his family  members  of  the  claimant's  loss  of
    status as a British citizen should be taken into account.   He  was  of
    otherwise  good  character  and  his  wife  and  two  British   citizen
    daughters, now aged 10 and 7, were in  the  United  Kingdom  with  him,
    having arrived in the United Kingdom in the summer of 2019.

44. The claimant provided for all his  family  members.   If  he  left  the
    United Kingdom, there would be a lack of financial  stability  for  the
    rest of the family and his daughters might have to move schools or have
    difficulty in affording the social activities they enjoyed,  preventing
    them from taking a full part in school or community life.    Mr  Martin
    did not suggest that this on its own was a winning point, but  that  it
    should be weighed in the overall balance.

45. The claimant had now been in the United Kingdom for 22  years  and  had
    established his private life here, and weight should also be  given  to
    that.  Mr Martin accepted that the deprivation of citizenship would not
    require him to leave the United Kingdom, but  his  British  citizenship
    would be lost.

46. Mr Martin asked me to uphold the decision of the First-tier  Judge  and
    find that the Secretary of State's deprivation of citizenship  decision
    in January 2019 was unlawful.

Secretary of State's submissions

47. For the Secretary of State, Mr Clarke  argued  that  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision was lawful, given the claimant's admittedly fraudulent
    acquisition of British nationality.  She had made to this  claimant  no
    clear unambiguous promise  of  the  type  contemplated  in  Bancoult  v
    Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2008] UKHL 61.
     Applying EB (Kosovo) at  [13]-[16],  there  was  no  specified  period
    within which, or at which, an immigration  decision must be  made:  the
    duty of the decision maker is to have regard  to  the  facts,  and  any
    policy in force, when the decision is made.

48. The Secretary of State's decision not to prosecute the claimant for his
    deception should not  be  given  any  significant  weight;  the  public
    interest was in maintaining the integrity of  British  citizenship  and
    the rights which attached thereto (see  Hysaj  [2020]  at  [117]).   Mr
    Clarke submitted that the public interest clearly  outweighed  that  of
    the claimant and his family.

49. There was no  exceptionality  here  of  the  type  contemplated  in  BA
    (deprivation of citizenship: appeals) Ghana [2018] UKUT 85 (IAC).   The
    sole exceptionality relied upon was the alleged delay by the  Secretary
    of State in making her deprivation decision, but she  was  entitled  to
    rely on the legal advice given to her, such that time only began to run
    from December 2017, when the Secretary of  State  acknowledged  in  the
    Supreme Court that nullity was not the correct analysis of this type of
    fraudulent acquisition of British citizenship.

50. Beyond a bare assertion in his  witness  statement,  the  claimant  had
    produced no evidence which  could  support  a  finding  of  exceptional
    circumstances. Nor had the claimant demonstrated the existence  of  any
    illegality, inconsistency, or pre-existing historic  injustice  in  the
    Secretary of State's decision: see Mousasaoui v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 50 at [27].

51. As to the  interference  with  family  life,  Mr  Clarke  reminded  the
    Tribunal that no Article 8 ECHR decision on an application for leave to
    enter or remain by this claimant had  yet  been  made;  the  Article  8
    consideration in the present appeal was restricted to 'limbo', that  is
    to say, to the  effect  of  the  claimant  of  the  delay  between  the
    withdrawal  of  the  nullity  decision  in  February  2018  before  the
    deprivation of citizenship decision was made.  The claimant could  make
    an Article 8 ECHR claim for leave to remain even if the deprivation  of
    citizenship were maintained, and a negative decision would  generate  a
    new right of appeal on human rights grounds.

52. Mr Clarke asked me to allow the Secretary of State's appeal and  uphold
    her decision to deprive  the  claimant  of  his  fraudulently  acquired
    British citizenship.

53. I reserved my decision, and explained to  the  claimant  that  I  would
    deliver it in writing  as  soon  as  possible,  having  regard  to  the
    evidence and arguments advanced by both representatives.

Legal framework

54.  Deprivation  of  citizenship  was  added  to  the  1981  Act  by   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended), and  so  far
    as relevant provides as follows:

         "Deprivation of citizenship.

         (1)  In this section a reference to a person's "citizenship status"
         is a reference to his status as-

             (a)  a British citizen, ...

         (2)  The Secretary of State may by order deprive a person of a
         citizenship status which results from his registration or
         naturalisation if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the
         registration or naturalisation was obtained by means of-

             (a)  fraud,

             (b)  false representation, or

             (c)  concealment of a material fact. ...

         (5)  Before making an order under this section in respect of a
         person the Secretary of State must give the person written notice
         specifying-

             (a)  that the Secretary of State has decided to make an order,

             (b)  the reasons for the order, and

             (c)  the person's right of appeal under section 40A(1) ..."

55. In EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL
    41,  the House of Lords considered the effect of delay,  in  particular
    at [14]-[16] in the opinion of Lord Bingham, with whom Lord Hope,  Lord
    Scott and Baroness Hale agreed, with Lord  Brown  dissenting  in  part.
    They all agreed that the duty of a decision maker was to have regard to
    the facts, and any policy in force, when the decision was made.

56. Lord Bingham identified three ways in which any delay to an immigration
    decision might be relevant:

      i) Where the claimant had developed closer personal  and  social  ties
         and established deeper roots in the community over time.

     ii) The effect of strain on a personal relationship and the fading of a
         sense of impermanence over time; and

    iii) The effect of 'a dysfunctional system which  yields  unpredictable,
         inconsistent and unfair outcomes', reducing the weight otherwise to
         be accorded to  the  requirements  of  firm  and  fair  immigration
         control,

57. Lord Brown's partial dissent at [40]-[42] is illuminating  in  that  it
    presages the Hysaj analysis:

         "42. I accept, as stated, that  the  longer  the  passage  of  time
         before the decision is taken,  the  more  likely  it  is  that  the
         strength of the article 8 claim will be affected: family or private
         life ties may be created, lost, strengthened  or  weakened  and  it
         will become increasingly difficult for the Secretary  of  State  to
         rely upon the precariousness of the applicant's immigration  status
         when bonds are formed  and  relationships  entrenched  to  discount
         their strength. ... These matters should not  be  relevant  to  the
         striking of the proportionality balance. Article 8 claimants  ought
         not to be advantaged merely because of deficiencies in the  control
         system. If the public interest  otherwise  requires  that  a  claim
         fails, it should not succeed merely  because  it  might  have  been
         stronger had it been determined  earlier  or  because  the  control
         system should have been better administered."      [Emphasis added]

58. The Secretary of State's Deprivation and Nullity of British citizenship
    guidance for caseworkers, published on 27 July 2017, is relied upon  by
    the claimant, in particular sub-paragraphs 55.7.2-55.7.5:

         "55.7    Material to the Acquisition of Citizenship

         55.7.1   If the relevant facts, had they been known at the time the
         application for citizenship was considered, would have affected the
         decision to grant citizenship via naturalisation or registration
         the caseworker should consider deprivation.

         55.7.2   This will include but is not limited to: ...

                .  False details given in relation to an immigration or
                asylum application, which led to that status being given to
                a person who would not otherwise have qualified, and so
                would have affected a person's ability to meet the residence
                and/or good character requirements for naturalisation or
                registration

         55.7.3   If the fraud, false representation or concealment of
         material fact did not have a direct bearing on the grant of
         citizenship, it will not be appropriate to pursue deprivation
         action.

         55.7.4   ... a person may use a different name if they wish (see
         NAMES in the General Information section of Volume 2 of the Staff
         Instructions): unless it conceals ... immigration history in
         another identity it is not material to the acquisition of ILR or
         citizenship. However, before making a decision not to deprive, the
         caseworker should ensure that relevant character checks are
         undertaken in relation to the subject's true identity to ensure
         that the false information provided to the Home Office was not used
         to conceal criminality or other information relevant to an
         assessment of their character.

         55.7.5   In general the Secretary of State will not deprive of
         British citizenship in the following circumstances:

                .  Where fraud postdates the application for British
                citizenship it will not be appropriate to pursue deprivation
                action.

                .  If a person was a minor on the date at which they applied
                for citizenship we will not deprive of citizenship

                .  If a person was a minor on the date at which they
                acquired indefinite leave to remain and the false
                representation, concealment of material fact or fraud arose
                at that stage and the leave to remain led to the subsequent
                acquisition of citizenship we will not deprive of
                citizenship

         However, where it is in the public interest to deprive despite the
         presence of these factors they will not prevent deprivation.

         55.7.6   Length of residence in the UK alone will not normally be a
         reason not to deprive a person of their citizenship."

Hysaj [2017] - the Supreme Court decision

59. In R (Hysaj) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  UKSC
    82 ('Hysaj [2017]'), the Supreme Court held, following a concession  by
    the Secretary of State, that where there was nationality  fraud,  there
    were two possible analyses, in only one of which the grant  of  British
    citizenship could properly be considered a nullity:

      i) 'Double identity' nationality  fraud.   Where  a  claimant  used  a
         qualifying national identity which belonged to another person,  the
         subsequent grant of citizenship was a nullity because  it  was  not
         clear to whom it had been granted,  or  indeed,  whether  the  real
         person to whom the qualifying identity belonged had  any  knowledge
         of the application for naturalisation, or was even still alive; but

     ii) 'Single identity' nationality fraud.   Where  a  claimant  invented
         fraudulent qualifying nationality details,  not  belonging  to  any
         real person, then there was no  doubt  about  the  person  to  whom
         naturalisation  was  granted  (albeit  by  another  name  and  with
         different qualifying  nationality  details).   In  that  case,  the
         naturalisation remained valid until the Secretary of State  made  a
         deprivation decision under section 40 of the 1981 Act.

60. The Secretary of State  withdrew  her  nullity  decision  in  Hysaj  in
    February 2018 and made a section 40(3) decision in July 2018.  Mr Hysaj
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

Hysaj [2020] - the Upper Tribunal guidance

61. In due course, the second Hysaj appeal reached the Upper Tribunal.  The
    Presidential guidance, summarised in  the  judicial  headnote,  was  as
    follows:

         "1.  The starting point in  any  consideration  undertaken  by  the
         Secretary of State ("the respondent") as to whether  to  deprive  a
         person of British citizenship must be  made  by  reference  to  the
         rules and policy in force at the time the decision is made. Rule of
         law values indicate that the respondent is entitled to take  advice
         and act in light of the state of law and the circumstances known to
         her. The benefit of hindsight, post the Supreme Court judgment in R
         (Hysaj) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2017]  UKSC
         82,  does  not  lessen  the  significant  public  interest  in  the
         deprivation  of  British  citizenship  acquired  through  fraud  or
         deception.

         2.   No legitimate expectation  arises  that  consideration  as  to
         whether or not to deprive citizenship is to be  undertaken  by  the
         application of a historic policy that was in  place  prior  to  the
         judgment of the Supreme Court in Hysaj.

         3.   No historic injustice is capable of arising  in  circumstances
         where the respondent erroneously declared British citizenship to be
         a nullity, rather than seek to deprive under section 40(3)  of  the
         British Nationality Act 1981, as no prejudice arises because it  is
         not possible to establish that a decision to  deprive  should  have
         been taken under a specific policy  within  a  specific  period  of
         time.

         4.   The respondent's  14-year  policy  under  her  deprivation  of
         citizenship policy, which was withdrawn on 20 August 2014,  applied
         a  continuous  residence  requirement  that  was  broken   by   the
         imposition of a custodial sentence.

         5.   A refugee is to meet the requirement of article 1A(2)  of  the
         1951 UN  Refugee  Convention  and  a  person  cannot  have  enjoyed
         Convention status if recognition  was  consequent  to  an  entirely
         false presentation as to a well-founded fear of persecution.

         6.   Upon deprivation of British citizenship, there is no automatic
         revival of previously held indefinite leave to remain status.

         7.   There is a heavy weight to be placed upon the public  interest
         in maintaining  the  integrity  of  the  system  by  which  foreign
         nationals are naturalised and permitted to enjoy  the  benefits  of
         British citizenship. Any effect on day-to-day life that may  result
         from  a  person  being  deprived  of  British  citizenship   is   a
         consequence of the that person's fraud or  deception  and,  without
         more, cannot tip the proportionality balance, so as to  compel  the
         respondent to grant a period of leave, whether short or otherwise."

62. Both Bancoult and Mousasaoui are taken into  account  in  the  guidance
    given in Hysaj [2020].  The ratio decidendi  of  the  decision  of  the
    House of Lords in R (Bancoult)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2008] UKHL 61, [2009] 1 AC 453, at [67], is  summarised  at
    [67] in the Upper Tribunal decision:

         "67. ... The only legitimate expectation enjoyed by  the  appellant
         is that his case would be treated in accordance with  the  law  and
         policy in place  at  the  time  the  relevant  decision  was  made.
         Consequently,  the  appellant's  submission  that  he   enjoyed   a
         legitimate expectation to be treated in a particular way  under  an
         earlier policy must fail."

         [Emphasis added]

63. The Tribunal also had regard to the judgment of the Court of Appeal  in
    Mousasaoui v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ
    50 at [72]:

         "72. ... the establishment of  historic  injustice  requires  prior
         illegality  and  there  is  a   significant   distinction   between
         illegality and maladministration."

Analysis

64. The first point to note is that the right of appeal before the Tribunal
    today arises from to the Secretary of State's deprivation decision made
    in April 2019, rather than the nullity decision made in 2014 which  was
    withdrawn in February 2018 and which is now academic.

65. The following points were not disputed, or were conceded, by Mr  Martin
    on behalf of the claimant:

      a) That in 2010, when the claimant's fraud was revealed, he  had  less
         than 14 years' residence in the United Kingdom;

      b) That in  2014,  when  the  Secretary  of  State  made  her  nullity
         decision, she was entitled to rely on the legal  advice  she  would
         then have been given, and that her  decision  that  the  claimant's
         citizenship status was a nullity was then a lawful decision;

      c) That in April 2019, when the deprivation  decision  was  taken,  no
         Article 8 ECHR family life issue arose because the claimant's  wife
         and daughters were in Albania;

      d) That the citizenship status of the claimant's  wife  and  daughters
         are unaffected by the  deprivation  decision  in  relation  to  the
         claimant's citizenship status; and

      e) That the deprivation decision in April 2019  did  not  require  the
         claimant to leave the United Kingdom.

66. Mr Martin's principal arguments were as follows:

      a)  That  the  Secretary  of  State's  2014   nullity   decision   was
         retrospectively erroneous, even if lawful at the  time,  such  that
         she ought not to have decided in 2014 to deprive  the  claimant  of
         his citizenship status;

      b) That the claimant had a legitimate expectation  to  be  allowed  to
         remain in the United Kingdom;

      c) That Mr Hysaj was not an appropriate comparator, as  his  residence
         had been interrupted by imprisonment, which the claimant's had not;

      d) That the deprivation decision  breached  the  claimant's  right  to
         private life because of:

          i) The uncertainty created by the limbo in his citizenship status
             between 2010 and 2019;

         ii) The lack of financial stability for his wife and daughters, if
             the claimant had to leave  the  United  Kingdom,  which  might
             result in the daughters  having  to  change  school,  or  have
             difficulty in affording the social  activities  they  enjoyed,
             preventing them from taking a full part in school or community
             life; and that

        iii) despite his deception, the claimant had been an otherwise law-
             abiding resident of the  United  Kingdom,  as  a  single  man,
             working hard, paying taxes and a mortgage,  and  investing  in
             property here, such that the Secretary of  State's  discretion
             to deprive him of citizenship  status  should  not  have  been
             exercised.

67. The first argument cannot succeed.  The current appeal is  against  the
    2019 deprivation  decision,  the  2014  nullity  decision  having  been
    withdrawn in 2018.  Mr Martin conceded that  when  taken,  the  nullity
    decision  would   have   been   lawful.    It   cannot   therefore   be
    retrospectively unlawful, despite Mr Martin's eloquence.

68. The 2014 decision was made by reference to  the  Rules  and  policy  in
    force at the  time  the  decision  was  made  and  could  not  be  made
    retrospectively unlawful by the Secretary of State's  later  concession
    in Hysaj [2017].  The Secretary of State could not be expected to  have
    predicted the concession she made in  the  Supreme  Court  in  December
    2017, that nullity was not the correct response for  'single  identity'
    nationality fraud.

69. The second argument also falls,  when  the  Hysaj  [2020]  guidance  is
    considered.  The Upper Tribunal expressly found that a claimant who had
    committed 'single  identity'  nationality  fraud  could  not  have  any
    legitimate expectation that  the  Secretary  of  State  would  apply  a
    historic policy, or any historic injustice  in  the  withdrawn  nullity
    decision (see Hysaj [2020] guidance, at (1) and (3)).

70. The claimant asserted that the Secretary of State's guidance  indicated
    that normally, a deprivation decision should  not  be  made  where  the
    person had been resident in the  United  Kingdom  for  14  years.   The
    version of the Secretary of  State's  guidance  which  appears  in  the
    bundle is the July 2017 version, which would have been the guidance  in
    force when the April 2019 deprivation decision was made.  There  is  no
    reference to any such favourable presumption in the 2017 guidance.  The
    true facts, if known when he made the application, would have  affected
    the Secretary of State's decision to grant naturalisation (see  55.7.1)
    and the claimant does not fall within any of the cited exceptions:  the
    falsehood preceded the application  for  naturalisation,  nor  was  the
    claimant at any relevant time a minor (see 55.7.5).

71. It is right that the facts in Hysaj are different from  those  in  this
    appeal.  Mr Hysaj could not show an uninterrupted period  of  residence
    because of his criminality.  Each case is to  be  decided  on  its  own
    facts.  The delay in this case was mainly of the claimant's making:  he
    did not disclose his fraud for 12 years after his arrival in the United
    Kingdom, as an adult, in 1998, and then only because he had an Albanian
    fiancï¿½e and wanted her to join him in the United Kingdom.  The claimant
    has apologised for that, but as  noted  at  [7]  in  the  Hysaj  [2020]
    guidance:

         "7.  There is a heavy weight to be placed upon the public  interest
         in maintaining  the  integrity  of  the  system  by  which  foreign
         nationals are naturalised and permitted to enjoy  the  benefits  of
         British citizenship. Any effect on day-to-day life that may  result
         from  a  person  being  deprived  of  British  citizenship   is   a
         consequence of that person's fraud or deception and, without  more,
         cannot tip  the  proportionality  balance,  so  as  to  compel  the
         respondent to grant a period of leave, whether short or otherwise."

72. As regards the period of 'limbo' between 2010 and 2019,  there  was  no
    real disadvantage to this claimant.  He continued living in the  United
    Kingdom.  There was no strengthening of private and family life ties in
    the United Kingdom.  The claimant's wife and daughters lived  with  her
    parents in Albania at all material times.   Thereafter, the  claimant's
    British citizenship remained  valid  until  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision in April 2019.

73. Further, when considering the period of limbo, the delay  between  2010
    and 2019 is not, in my opinion, the relevant period:  from the date  of
    disclosure in 2010 until the Supreme Court hearing  in  December  2017,
    the Secretary of State was entitled to rely on the legal position  that
    both 'single identity' and 'double identity' nationality fraud  led  to
    the grant of citizenship being a nullity.

74. That changed with her concession on 'single identity' nationality fraud
    in December 2017  and  subsequent  prompt  withdrawal  of  the  nullity
    decision in February 2018.  Also in December  2017,  the  Secretary  of
    State issued the claimant with a biometric residence permit  indicating
    that he was settled in the United Kingdom, valid from 13 December  2017
    to 5 December 2019, which permitted him to travel to visit his wife and
    daughters in Albania (see  the  claimant's  witness  statement  in  his
    wife's entry clearance appeal, which was linked to this appeal).

75. The claimant was able to visit and receive visits from his  partner  in
    Albania, at least until the nullity decision in 2014, and again between
    2017 and 2019, when he had discretionary leave.  His partner  was  able
    to make a short visit to the United Kingdom to see him.   The  claimant
    was able to work as a dry liner, to continue paying his mortgage and to
    accumulate equity in his United Kingdom property.  The evidence of  any
    relevant private life in the United Kingdom at the date of decision  in
    April 2019 was scant, and limited  to  the  claimant's  work  and  some
    friendships.

76. The question whether if the claimant left the United Kingdom, his  wife
    and daughters would lack financial stability, and the possibility  that
    his daughters might have to change school after one year in  a  British
    school (much of it presumably studying at home because of the  COVID-19
    pandemic),  or  might  have  difficulty  affording   enjoyable   social
    activities and participating in school and community life as they would
    wish, are all matters which arise only if the Secretary of State  seeks
    to remove the claimant from the United Kingdom, which she has  not  yet
    sought to do.

77. On the contrary, the Secretary of State has not challenged the decision
    of the First-tier Judge in the wife's appeal which allowed her, and the
    younger daughter, to rejoin the claimant and the older daughter so that
    they could begin to live together as a family here.  The girls have now
    completed a whole year of school in the United Kingdom and family  life
    has been established.   It remains open to  the  claimant  to  make  an
    Article 8 ECHR application for leave to remain on human rights grounds.



78. There is therefore no proposed interference with the claimant's Article
    8 ECHR rights at present.  Even if they were relevant to  this  appeal,
    which they are not, the claimant's human rights  do  not  outweigh  the
    United Kingdom's right to maintain the integrity of the system by which
    foreign nationals such as this claimant are naturalised  and  permitted
    to enjoy the benefits of British citizenship.

79. I have set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  I
    substitute a decision dismissing  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
    decision to deprive him of his British citizen status.



DECISION

80. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by dismissing
    the claimant's appeal.
