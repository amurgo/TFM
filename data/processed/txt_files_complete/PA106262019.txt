                         UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE COKER

                                   Between

                                     SSH
                           (Anonymity order made)
                                  Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                          DETERMINATION BY CONSENT

   Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
   (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal  or  a
   Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or  any  form  of
   publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify  the  appellant
   in this determination identified  as  SSH.  This  direction  applies  to,
   amongst others, all parties. Any failure to comply  with  this  direction
   could give rise to contempt of court proceedings

    Both parties having complied with the Directions  sent  on  20th  April
    2020 and pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 and by the consent of the parties  the  following  order  is
    made:

         Upon the determination by First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Andrew  Davies
         promulgated on 2nd January 2020 disclosing a material error of  law
         and being set aside on 1st May 2020.

         And upon the parties agreeing that the  evidence  establishes  that
         SSH would be at serious risk of being persecuted for  a  Convention
         reason, the appeal by SSH against the  refusal  of  his  protection
         claim is allowed.

    The appeal in the Upper Tribunal is allowed.  The decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal is set aside for legal error.   The  appeal  against  the
    decision giving rise to  the  appeal  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    allowed.



Signed                                  Date 1st May 2020
Upper Tribunal Judge Coker
