               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Layne, counsel instructed by Law & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Singh, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Germany appealed against the  Respondent's
    decision  dated  8  May  2015,  to  refuse  to  issue  a   registration
    certificate with reference to the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 on the basis that he had failed to provide  sufficient
    evidence that he was a qualified  person  as  defined  under  the  2006
    Regulations.

2.   His appeal together with that of Miss  Chandni  Maqbool  before  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge C A S O'Garro (the  Judge)  who,  on  20  September
    2016, dismissed Mr Khan's and Miss Maqbool's appeals.   The  appeal  of
    Miss Maqbool has fallen away as a result of the fact that she claims to
    be an extended family member and by reason  of  the  decision  in  Sala
    [2016] UKUT 00411 there is no right of appeal.  So far as Mr  Khan  was
    concerned the position is that the Judge  made  a  number  of  positive
    findings of fact on  the  evidence  and  concluded  that  Mr  Khan  was
    exercising  treaty  rights  and  was  entitled  to  be  issued  with  a
    registration document.  It is clear that she then for reasons which can
    only be attributed to be a mistake  dismissed  Mr  Khan's  appeal  when
    clearly she was satisfied that he had met the requirements of the  2006
    Regulations.

3.   Accordingly the parties are agreed that there is a  material  error  of
    law in the Judge's  decision  on  the  matter  and  that  the  Original
    Tribunal decision cannot stand and must be remade.

4.   It is agreed that I can readily remake the decision  on  the  basis  of
    the positive findings of fact made by the Judge in Mr Khan's  case.  In
    the light of the same I  do  no  more  than  consider  and  accept  the
    conclusion reached, with which there is no disagreement, that he was  a
    qualified person and entitled to a residence certificate.   Accordingly
    the following decision is substituted.

          DECISION
          The appeal of Mr Khan is allowed.

          ANONYMITY ORDER
         No anonymity order was sought and none is necessary.

Signed                                  Date 30 May 2017

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In the case of Mr Khan a fee of ï¿½140 was paid.  The appeal succeeded on  the
basis  of  material  which  he  had  advanced  before  the  Judge.  In   the
circumstances notwithstanding the Judge's mistake it seems to me that  there
is no need nor is it appropriate for a fee award to be made.

Signed                                  Date 30 May 2017
