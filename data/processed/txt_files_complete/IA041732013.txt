                DETERMINATION AND NOTICE PURSUANT TO RULE 17A


1. On 14 May 2013 the appellant was granted  permission  to  appeal  against
   the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  dismissed  her  appeal
   against a refusal to vary leave to remain.

2. The respondent has notified the Upper  Tribunal  by  a  letter  dated  13
   September 2013 that the appellant has now been granted further  leave  to
   remain. A copy of the grant of leave, has also been provided.

3. The appeal before the Upper Tribunal is therefore abandoned  pursuant  to
   section 104 (4A) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


4. This disposes of the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal.




Signed:                                      Date:  16 September 2013
