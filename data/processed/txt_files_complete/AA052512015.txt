Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Shimmin  promulgated  7.8.15,  allowing  on
    asylum and human rights  grounds  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse his  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    29.7.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    1.9.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 15.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below, I found such error of law in the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Shimmin to be set aside and remade.

 5. Judge Shimmin rejected the claimant's claim to be a  Christian  convert
    as not credible. In  fact,  at  �62  the  judge  rejected  all  of  the
    claimant's factual case, with the exception of his Iranian  nationality
    and that he left Iran illegally.

 6. The point at issue in the appeal is a simple one. In assessing the risk
    on return, applying SB (risk on return - illegal exit) Iran  CG  [2009]
    UKAIT 00053, Judge Shimmin took account of the fact that  the  claimant
    has a crucifix tattooed on his chest and proceeded on  the  basis  that
    this was a permanent mark. The judge found that because of his  illegal
    exit on return the claimant would likely be  questioned,  detained  and
    searched, in which search the judge  considered  it  reasonably  likely
    that the tattoo would be seen. At �67 the judge stated,  "even  if  the
    appellant passes through the airport safely he will have  to  live  his
    life in Iran with a cross on his chest and it is reasonably likely that
    it will be discovered at some time. This will bring him to the  adverse
    attention of the authorities. Having such a symbol will identify him as
    someone who has involved himself in anti-Islamic  conduct,  namely  his
    conversion  to  Christianity,  and  I  find  that  this  constitutes  a
    significant risk factor. Effectively,  the  appellant  has,  by  having
    himself tattooed with a cross, undertaken a  sur  place  activity  that
    puts him at risk of ill-treatment."

 7. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal complain that the judge  has
    not adequately considered whether it would be reasonably  possible  for
    the claimant  to  discretely  cover  the  tattoo  by  temporary,  semi-
    permanent, or permanent means, and that the judge  has  not  considered
    whether it would be reasonably possible for the tattoo to be altered or
    removed, such that it would not expose the claimant to adverse interest
    on return. "Given the (claimant) has not been found to  genuinely  hold
    any Christian belief, it is submitted  that  it  will  not  breach  the
    (claimant's) rights to expect him to cover, conceal,  alter  or  remove
    the tattoo prior to return. The judge's failure to adequately  consider
    whether reasonable adjustments could be made by the (claimant) allowing
    him to return safely amounts to material misdirection as to risk."

 8. In granting permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Nicholson  considered  that
    "Since the judge effectively found that the tattoo was not  a  sign  of
    any genuinely held belief, it is arguable  that  the  (claimant)  could
    reasonably be expected to have it changed or at least  that  the  judge
    should have considered whether the (claimant) would in practice have it
    changed  before  return  or  whether  it  was  reasonably  likely   the
    (claimant) would refuse to do so and actually put himself at  risk  for
    something he did not believe in."

 9. I reject Ms Khan's argument that this is merely a disagreement with the
    findings of the judge,  or  that  the  Secretary  of  State  should  be
    prevented from making such an argument because it was not  specifically
    canvassed at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing. The points made by
    the Secretary of State are simple and obvious.

10. There has been no cross-appeal against the finding that the claimant is
    not a genuine Christian convert and that  part  of  the  decision  must
    stand. In that light, the cynical obtaining of a crucifix  tattoo  must
    be regarded as an entirely  self-serving  action  to  bolster  a  false
    asylum claim and cannot represent any genuinely-held belief.

11. I also reject Ms Khan's submission that it  would  be  unreasonable  to
    expect the claimant to change or remove the tattoo because  either  (a)
    it is an expression of personal opinion and he has made a person choice
    to have the tattoo displayed on his body; or (b) that removal would  be
    painful. In respect of the first I am satisfied  that  it  must  follow
    from the  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  to  his  claimed
    Christian conversion that it is not genuine self-expression, but rather
    a device to bolster a false claim. In respect of the  alleged  pain  in
    removal, I note it is common knowledge that tattoos can be altered  and
    inked over so as to obscure the original tattoo.  Further,  it  is  not
    necessary to have a permanent solution such as removal or amendment  of
    tattoo, as temporary or semi-permanent obscuring without pain  is  also
    possible. I am not satisfied that removing, altering or  obscuring,  or
    disguising this tattoo, obtained by the claimant in  the  circumstances
    of the finding of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  as  to  his  claimed
    Christian conversion can properly be described as  an  infringement  of
    his freedom of expression or physical integrity.

12. There is therefore  no  reason  why,  if  he  genuinely  fears  adverse
    treatment for this  reason  on  return,  the  claimant  should  not  be
    expected to have the tattoo removed, altered so as to disguise  it,  or
    discretely obscured in some other alternative way,  either  permanently
    or temporarily, so as to neutralise  any  risk  on  return  that  would
    otherwise arise in respect of a  person  bearing  such  a  mark.  I  am
    satisfied that the judge failed to address such considerations  and  in
    simply considering the tattoo permanent and discoverable  thereby  fell
    into error.

13. There was no other basis for allowing the claimant's appeal  and  given
    that there has been no cross-appeal against the finding rejecting every
    other part  of  his  claim  other  than  his  nationality  and  illegal
    departure, there is nothing else in the facts of this case  that  would
    render this claimant at risk on return,  applying  SB  (Iran),  and  BA
    (Demonstrators in Britain - risk on return)  Iran  CG  [2011]  UKUT  36
    (IAC). There is no real risk of persecution for those who  have  exited
    Iran illegally or are merely returning from Britain.

14. Ms Khan submitted that if the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  were
    to be set aside the claimant would wish to adduce further  evidence  as
    to the impact on him of removing the tattoo and further evidence of his
    Christian conversion, including that he has continued to attend  church
    and would be able to produce witnesses  to  that  effect.  However,  as
    pointed out, there was no cross appeal on that issue and that  part  of
    the decision must stand. If there is genuinely further  information  or
    evidence that the claimant would wish to rely on that may be  a  matter
    for him to consider by making a fresh claim. I do not see  that  it  is
    necessary or appropriate to reopen the issues already settled  in  this
    appeal.

15. Ms Khan also referred to a pending country guidance case on  the  issue
    of illegal departure from Iran, but the duty  of  the  Tribunal  is  to
    apply the case law as it stands including country guidance.

16. In the circumstances, I see no purpose in any further  hearing  and  on
    the basis the appeal must fail on all grounds.

Conclusions:

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an order.
Given the circumstances, I continue anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
