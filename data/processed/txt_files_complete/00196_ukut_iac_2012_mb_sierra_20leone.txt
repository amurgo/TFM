In a deportation appeal not falling within section 32 of the UK Borders Act
2007, the sequence of decision making set out in EO  (deportation  appeals:
scope and process) Turkey [2007] UKAIT 62 still applies but the first  step
is expanded as follows:

     i) Consider whether the person  is  liable  to  be  deported  on  the
        grounds set out by the Secretary  of  State.  This  will  normally
        involve the judge examining:-


           a. Whether the material facts alleged by the Secretary of  State
              are accepted and if not whether they  are  made  out  to  the
              civil standard flexibly applied;
           b. Whether on the  facts  established  viewed  as  a  whole  the
              conduct character or  associations  reach  such  a  level  of
              seriousness as to justify a decision to deport;
           c. In considering b) the judge will take account of  any  lawful
              policy of the Secretary of State relevant to the exercise  of
              the discretion to deport and whether the discretion has  been
              exercised in accordance with that policy;


    ii) If the person is liable to deportation, then the next question  to
        consider is whether a human rights or protection  claim  precludes
        deportation. In cases of private or family life, this will require
        an assessment of the proportionality of the measures  against  the
        family or private life in question, and a weighing of all relevant
        factors.


   iii) If the two previous steps are decided against the appellant,  then
        the question whether the discretion to deport has  been  exercised
        in accordance with the Immigration Rules applicable is  the  third
        step in the process. The present wording of the rules assumes that
        a person who is liable to deportation and whose deportation  would
        not be contrary to the law and in breach of  human  rights  should
        normally  be  deported  absent  exceptional  circumstances  to  be
        assessed  in the light of all relevant information  placed  before
        the Tribunal.



                               DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction

1.    This is a  determination  to  which  each  member  of  the  panel  has
      contributed. The appellant is a 25-year old national of  Sierra  Leone
      who has been living lawfully in the United Kingdom since  the  age  of
      seven.  He  appeals  with   permission   against   the   determination
      promulgated on 15 February 2011 of the First-tier Tribunal (Designated
      Immigration Judge Appleyard, Immigration Judge C. A. Parker and Mr.  M
      E Olszewski)) (hereafter referred to  as  the  panel)  dismissing  his
      appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State of 8  July  2008
      to make a deportation order against him by virtue of section  3(5)  of
      the Immigration Act 1971 ("the 1971 Act").  The  panel  dismissed  the
      appellant's appeal on human rights grounds  (Article  8  of  the  1950
      European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
      Freedoms ("ECHR")) and under paragraph 364 of the Statement of Changes
      in the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as  amended)  ("the  Immigration
      Rules").

2.    The appellant arrived in the United  Kingdom  on  24  September  1993,
      aged seven years. He was a dependant on his mother's  application  for
      asylum. On 18 October 1999, he and his family were granted  indefinite
      leave to remain in the United Kingdom. On 9 March  2005,  he  made  an
      application  for  naturalisation  as  a  British  citizen  which   the
      Secretary of State refused. In evidence before the panel,  he  claimed
      that he was in a relationship with a Ms. M and that the couple  had  a
      son (hereafter referred to as S) who was born in December 2007 and was
      accordingly seven months old at the time of the Secretary  of  State's
      decision and 4 �  years  at the time of this decision.

The Secretary of State's decision

3.    The reasons given by the Secretary of State for her decision  are  set
      out in the notice of the decision dated 8 July 2008, served on 10 July
      2008, and a letter dated 8 December 2008 addressed to the  appellant's
      former representatives. The reasons given referred to the  appellant's
      criminal  convictions,  which  we  set  out  at  Appendix  A  to  this
      determination. He was convicted on a total of  thirteen  occasions  of
      eighteen offences, offences which ranged  from  disorderly  behaviour,
      possession of cannabis, offering to  supply  cannabis,  assault  on  a
      constable, using threatening,  abusive  or  insulting  words,  driving
      without a licence  and  driving  whilst  disqualified.  The  sentences
      passed ranged between fines (of �30 and upwards) to a community  order
      for twelve months, a community rehabilitation order for 18 months  and
      one sentence of imprisonment for a period  of  five  weeks  which  was
      suspended for two months. It can fairly be said, both from the type of
      offence and the sentence passed,  that  each  individual  offence  was
      relatively minor in nature.

4.    The Secretary of State took the  view  that,  whilst  a  single  minor
      offence might not be regarded as giving rise  to  particular  concern,
      the appellant had established a record  of  persistent  offending  and
      that sanctions imposed by the Courts had had little or no effect  upon
      his conduct. The Secretary  of  State  also  relied  upon  information
      received  from  the  Metropolitan  Police,  according  to  which   the
      appellant had been identified as a member  of  a  South  London  gang,
      called the "Anti-Showermen". This gang was  said  to  have  access  to
      firearms and drugs and to be involved  in  serious  disorder.  On  the
      totality of the evidence, which was not  limited  to  the  appellant's
      convictions but also his  character,  conduct  and  associations,  the
      Secretary of State concluded that the appellant had  posed,  and  will
      continue to pose, a  serious  risk  to  the  community  and  that  his
      deportation was conducive to the public good.

5.    In support of the contention that the appellant was associated with  a
      violent criminal gang the Secretary of State relied, inter alia,  upon
      incidents involving the  appellant  which  had  not  resulted  in  any
      charges being brought or criminal convictions; statements of  evidence
      from  police  officers  describing   "Operation   Swale",   "Operation
      Alliance" and "Operation Bite;" and the results of  checks  made  with
      the criminal intelligence system (Crimint) under the appellant's  name
      and his street name of 'MO'. Twelve reports were identified and relied
      on, five of which linked the appellant directly to the  Anti-Showermen
      gang, although the reports themselves were not disclosed  in  evidence
      or (we were informed) to the Secretary of State in these  proceedings.



6.    The witnesses who  gave  evidence  before  the  panel  included  three
      police  officers  who  described  how  intelligence  is  gathered  and
      assessed and who confirmed that, based on such intelligence, including
      evidence  obtained  from  police  indices  (namely,  "CRIS"   reports,
      Crimint, and the Police National Computer (PNC)), the appellant was  a
      clear and present danger to the community. They described  allegations
      of crimes said to have been committed by the appellant (para 35 of the
      determination). On occasions, he was charged and convicted.  On  other
      occasions, charges were brought but not pursued. At  other  times,  he
      was not charged at  all.  The  police  witnesses  were  cross-examined
      extensively on the appellant's behalf but, when asked to reveal  their
      sources, refused to do so, on the ground  that  it  was  necessary  to
      protect those sources.

7.     The  appellant  also  gave  evidence  before  the  panel  about   the
      allegations of crime against him, saying that the police had  invented
      allegations against him, that he was a victim of police victimisation,
      and he had no knowledge of some of the individuals with  whom  he  was
      seen, that he had only met some  other  individuals  on  the  isolated
      occasions recorded by the police and/or that he did not  know  certain
      individuals were members of a gang.  In  submissions  before  us,  Mr.
      Jacobs argued that, as a person living in New Cross, the fact that the
      appellant may have been associated with  people  who  were  themselves
      involved with gangs was not relevant unless there  was  also  evidence
      that he was involved himself with the activities of the gang.

The panel's decision

8.    The panel found that the PNC  record,  printed  on  1  December  2008,
      provided an accurate record of the appellant's  criminal  convictions.
      It also found that the appellant had involved himself in all the  non-
      convicted  criminality  detailed  in  the  evidence  of   the   police
      witnesses. It rejected the explanations  given  by  the  appellant  or
      advanced on his behalf, that the police officers had embellished their
      accounts or  fabricated  the  intelligence.  The  panel  accepted  the
      evidence  of  the  police  witnesses  that  the  impact  of  potential
      disclosure of sources may result in serious threats to their life.

9.    The panel found that the appellant was a member of the  Anti-Showermen
      gang, that the gang had access to and  had  used  firearms,  committed
      serious acts  of  violence  including  murder,  attempted  murder  and
      robberies, and was engaged in the sale of crack  cocaine,  heroin  and
      cannabis. The panel was satisfied that the appellant had been involved
      in such activities and that  his  PNC  record  may  not  reflect  this
      criminality because the police were unable to  secure  evidence  which
      proved his guilt beyond reasonable doubt in the criminal jurisdiction.
      It found that the appellant was well aware of  the  character  of  his
      associates (para 349), rejecting his explanations that he did not know
      the individuals with whom he had been seen, or that he  did  not  know
      they were members of a gang, or that he had only  met  them  on  those
      isolated occasions recorded by the police. It said that it had reached
      these findings on the evidence as a whole, including the CRIS reports,
      Crimint and other police intelligence, the sources for which were  not
      disclosed. It said it bore in mind that the  weight  to  be  given  to
      material from anonymous sources may  be  necessarily  limited  but  it
      nevertheless decided  to  attach  weight  to  the  evidence  from  the
      sources. It found that the appellant was highly likely to re-offend.

10.   In relation  to  the  Article  8  claim,  the  panel  found  that  the
      appellant's relationship with Ms. M was  not  as  close  as  had  been
      claimed. It rejected the explanations advanced by  the  appellant  and
      Ms. M for their non-cohabitation when they had the chance to do so. It
      found that Ms. M. was the sister of a gang member  and  that  she  was
      fully aware of the appellant's activities. It found that the appellant
      was not S's primary carer. It accepted that the appellant had  private
      and family life in the United Kingdom. Whilst  it  accepted  that  the
      appellant had been in the United Kingdom for some eighteen  years,  it
      did not find that there were any other  positive  aspects  within  his
      claimed private life. He had failed to contribute to society in  terms
      of any employment whatsoever.  He did not respect the law. His private
      life centred on criminal conduct and gang membership. His  involvement
      in gun and violent crime was harmful  to  the  community  and  it  had
      impacted on his family. On at least two occasions, S had been  present
      at times of frightening incidents at the family home.  These  included
      shootings at the property and disturbances arising out of difficulties
      caused by the appellant and his family. This private life mingled with
      his family life. It found that there was no reason why both Ms. M  and
      S could not go with the appellant to Sierra Leone, as he was  a  child
      of an age at which it would be easy, with support from his parents, to
      adapt to a new situation. The panel said that it could not say that it
      was necessarily in the best interests and wellbeing of S to remain  in
      the United Kingdom with his parents as they may continue to expose him
      to criminality. For these and other  reasons,  the  panel  found  that
      there were very serious reasons to justify the appellant's  expulsion,
      that his deportation  would  be  conducive  to  the  public  good  and
      proportionate and that,  in  relation  to  para  364,  there  were  no
      exceptional  circumstances  which  were  sufficient  to  outweigh  the
      presumption in favour of deportation.

The appeal to the UT

11.   The principal issues which arise in this appeal case are

      1.    whether a decision to make an individual liable  to  deportation
           is subject to appellate scrutiny. In particular:-

            i)   whether the Secretary of State has  an  onus  to  establish
                 the facts on which the decision was based; and

            ii)  whether the exercise of the discretion  that  on  the  true
                 facts the individual is liable  to  deportation  should  be
                 exercised differently.

      2.    the approach to be adopted when the Secretary  of  State  wishes
           to rely upon evidence of an individual's activities  (actual  or
           potential) which fall short of criminal conduct  or  which  have
           not resulted in criminal convictions. We consider this under the
           following sub-headings:

             (i)   admissibility  of   hearsay   evidence,   evidence   from
                 undisclosed or anonymous sources; and

            (ii) the applicable standard of proof.


The legislative scheme

12.   In order  to  answer  these  questions  we  must  first  examine  the
      statutory basis for  decisions of this kind and the  appellate  power
      in respect of them. Section 3, sub-sections (5) and (6), of the  1971
      Act set out when a person is liable to deportation[1].  A  person  is
      liable to deportation in three circumstances:-


      a.    if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive
          to the public good, or
      b.    if another person to whose family he belongs  is  or  has  been
          ordered to be deported, or,
      c.    in the case of an individual who is over 17 years  of  age  and
          convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment, a court has
          recommended his deportation. Para 363 of the Immigration Rules is
          to the same effect.

13.   If a person is liable to deportation, section 5(1) of  the  1971  Act
      states that the Secretary of  State  may  make  a  deportation  order
      against him; that is, the Secretary of State has a discretion  as  to
      whether to make a deportation order[2].

14.   Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
      ("the 2002 Act") provides a right of appeal  against  an  immigration
      decision. By section 82(2) such decisions include (j) a  decision  to
      make a deportation order under section 5(1) of the 1971 Act.[3]


15.   By section 84(1) of the 2002 Act the grounds of appeal include:   "(e)
      that the decision is not in accordance with the law; and f)  that  the
      person  taking  the  decision  should  have  exercised  differently  a
      discretion conferred by immigration rules".

16.   From 20 July 2006, paragraph 364 as  amended  by  HC  1337,  reads  as
      follows (excluding transitional provisions that are inapplicable):

      "364. Subject to paragraph 380, while each case will be considered  on
             its merits,  where  a  person  is  liable  to  deportation  the
             presumption  shall  be  that  the  public   interest   requires
             deportation. The Secretary of State will consider all  relevant
             factors in considering whether the presumption is outweighed in
             any particular case, although it will only  be  in  exceptional
             circumstances that the public interest in deportation  will  be
             outweighed in a case where it would  not  be  contrary  to  the
             Human  Rights  Convention  and  the  Convention  and   Protocol
             relating to the Status of Refugees to deport.  The  aim  is  an
             exercise of the power of deportation which  is  consistent  and
             fair as between one person and another, although one case  will
             rarely be identical with another in all material respects.  ...
             ."

17.   In the present appeal, the substantive issue raised by  the  appellant
      is whether the Secretary of State can indeed demonstrate  that  he  is
      the member of the dangerous gang that he is alleged to be. If she  can
      there would be  a  powerful  case  to  justify  deportation:  both  in
      assessing  whether  deportation  is  a  justified  and   proportionate
      interference with the enjoyment of the family and private life of  the
      appellant and  (once the  human  rights  claim  has  been  considered)
      whether there  is  any  reason  to  depart  as  a  matter  of  general
      discretion from the presumption  under  the  current  version  of  the
      Immigration Rules.

18.   If, on the other hand, this allegation cannot be  substantiated,  then
      the case for deportation is  significantly  weakened  and  indeed  the
      factual basis  for  the  Secretary  of  State's  conclusion  that  the
      appellant was liable to deportation and therefore should  be  deported
      would be substantially undermined.

19.   The present appeal does not concern automatic deportation cases  under
      section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007 ("the 2007 Act"). If a person is
      a "foreign criminal" as  defined  in  section  32(1),  the  effect  of
      section 32 is that the deportation of the individual is  conducive  to
      the public good for the purposes of section 3(5)(a) of  the  1971  Act
      (see MK (deportation - foreign  criminal  -  public  interest)  Gambia
      [2010] UKUT 281 (IAC)). Accordingly, in automatic  deportation  cases,
      no question can arise as  to  whether  the  individual  is  liable  to
      deportation and/or the lawfulness of the Secretary of State's decision
      to make a deportation order against him.

20.   In EO (Deportation appeals: scope and  process)  Turkey  [2007]  UKAIT
      00062, the AIT said that, where a decision  to  make  a  discretionary
      deportation order was made on or after  20  July  2006,  the  Tribunal
      should first confirm that  the  appellant  is  liable  to  deportation
      (either  because  the  sentencing  judge  recommended  deportation  or
      because the Secretary of State has deemed deportation to be  conducive
      to the public good);  if  so,  it  should  secondly  consider  whether
      deportation would breach the  appellant's  rights  under  the  Refugee
      Convention or the  ECHR;  if  not,  thirdly  consider  para  364.  The
      guidance given by the AIT in EO (Turkey) was not commented upon by the
      Court of Appeal when the case went on appeal to it in  EO  (Turkey)  v
      SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 671.

21.   In relation to the first step (whether  an  individual  is  liable  to
      deportation), the AIT in EO (Turkey) said this, at  paragraphs  31  to
      34:

        "The process of decision-making and the process on an appeal


        31.      It is clear from both s3(5) and (6) of the 1971  Act,  and
            from paragraphs 363-364 of the Immigration Rules that the first
            question for a  decision-maker  is  whether  an  individual  is
            liable to deportation. So far as concerns a person who has been
            recommended for deportation by a criminal court, his  liability
            for deportation has been effected by the sentencing judge.  The
            liability for deportation as  a  member  of  the  family  of  a
            deportee is parasitic  upon  a  deportation  decision  made  in
            respect of another person.  But the liability to deportation on
            "public good" grounds needs a little elaboration.  Contrary  to
            what might  be  supposed,  it  is  clear  throughout  that  the
            liability to deportation does not arise  from  an  individual's
            misconduct.  It arises from the Secretary  of  State  taking  a
            view: a person is liable to deportation under s3(5)(a)  if  the
            Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the
            public good.  In cases of this sort, therefore, the first stage
            is the process by which the Secretary of State decides  that  a
            person's deportation is conducive to the public  good.   It  is
            that decision of the  Secretary  of  State  which  renders  the
            individual liable to deportation.


        32.      Now both that decision and the decision  of  a  sentencing
            judge  to  recommend  deportation  are  decisions  importing  a
            discretion.  But they are not appealable.  The decision that  a
            person is liable to deportation (as distinct from the  decision
            that he is to be deported) is not a decision listed in  s82(2).
            So whatever view is taken  of  the  meaning  of  s84(1)(f),  an
            appellant  has  no  scope  for  arguing  that  the   discretion
            exercised in rendering him liable to  deportation  should  have
            been exercised differently.


        33.      If the person is liable to  deportation  for  one  of  the
            reasons set out in s3(5) and (6) (and summarised  in  paragraph
            363), the next question  is  whether  he  should  be  deported.
            This, as we have said, is again a discretionary  decision.   It
            is to be made under s5(1) but on the basis of paragraph 364.


        34.      On an  appeal,  the  Tribunal  ought  to  consider  first,
            whether the appellant is liable to  deportation.   In  view  of
            what we have already said  about  that,  this  means  that  the
            Tribunal will need to check that the  Secretary  of  State  has
            deemed his deportation to be conducive to the public  good,  or
            he is the family member of a person who is to be  deported,  or
            he has been recommended for deportation by  a  criminal  court.
            The Tribunal ought then  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  the
            appellant's deportation would breach any right of his under the
            Refugee Convention or the European Convention on Human  Rights:
            if it would, there is no power to deport him, and, on its face,
            paragraph 364 does  not  apply  to  him.   It  is  only  if  an
            appellant is liable to deportation, and not prevented by one of
            the Conventions from being deported, that the exercise  of  the
            discretion under paragraph 364 comes into the matter at all."

22.   In EO (Turkey) itself, there was no issue about the factual  basis  by
      which the appellant was liable to deportation: he was a failed  asylum
      seeker who had no leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom;  he  had
      committed an offence of sexual assault and had  been  recommended  for
      deportation by the trial  judge.  EO  (Turkey)  accordingly  does  not
      address the resolution of the  present  problem  where  the  appellant
      seeks to challenge the factual basis on which the Secretary  of  State
      reached the conclusion both that he  was  liable  to  deportation  and
      should be made the subject of a deportation decision. In any event, in
      the light of the submissions we have heard and the authorities we have
      been referred to, we consider that the last sentence in  paragraph  32
      of EO (Turkey) is too broadly stated and should no longer be followed,
      for the reasons given below.

Issue 1 - i) Appellate scrutiny of the factual foundation  of  liability  to
deportation

23.   There seems little doubt that under  the  statutory  regime  in  force
      before the enactment of the 2002 Act, an appellant could challenge the
      basis on which the Secretary of State concluded that he was liable  to
      deportation and should be made the subject of a deportation  decision.
      Perhaps the most authoritative exposition of the law is to be found in
      the decision of the House of Lords in the case of SSHD v Rehman [2001]
      UKHL 47, [2003] 1 AC 153. This was a national security case which  was
      heard before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission ("SIAC") under
      the provisions of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997,
      where the right of appeal reflected those set out in the 1971 Act.

24.   Lord Slynn of Hadley said (at para 8):

                 "8.   The 1971 Act contemplates first a  decision  by  the
            Secretary of State to make a deportation  order  under  section
            3(5) of that Act, in the present case in respect  of  a  person
            who is not a British citizen "(b) if  the  Secretary  of  State
            deems his deportation to be  conducive  to  the  public  good".
            There is no definition or limitation of what can be  "conducive
            to the public good" and the matter  is  plainly  in  the  first
            instance and primarily one for the discretion of the  Secretary
            of State. The decision of the Secretary  of  State  to  make  a
            deportation order is subject to appeal by section  15(1)(a)  of
            the 1971 Act......"

25.   Lord Slynn then went on to describe the exclusion  of  the  right  of
      appeal in  cases  in  national  security  cases  and  the  subsequent
      judgment of the European Court of Human Rights  in  Chahal  v  United
      Kingdom (1996) 23 EHRR 413 that the advisory procedure which was  set
      up under the 1971 Act in lieu of a right of appeal did not provide an
      effective remedy within Article 13 of  the  ECHR  which  led  to  the
      removal of the exclusion of the right of appeal in national  security
      cases. His Lordship then said (at paras 10 and 11):


        "10.      Section  4(1)  of  the   [Special   Immigration   Appeals
            Commission  Act  1997  (the  1997  Act)]  provides   that   the
            Commission:


           "(a) shall allow the  appeal  if  it  considers-  (i)  that  the
            decision or action against which the appeal is brought was  not
            in accordance with  the  law  or  with  any  immigration  rules
            applicable to the case, or (ii) where the  decision  or  action
            involved the exercise of a discretion by the Secretary of State
            or an officer, that the discretion should have  been  exercised
            differently, and (b) in  any  other  case,  shall  dismiss  the
            appeal."


        11.      It seems to me that on this  language  and  in  accordance
            with the purpose of the legislation  to  ensure  an  "effective
            remedy", within the meaning  of  article  13  of  the  European
            Convention, that the Commission was  empowered  to  review  the
            Secretary of State's decision on the law and also to review his
            findings of fact. It was also given the  power  to  review  the
            question whether the  discretion  should  have  been  exercised
            differently. Whether or nor the  discretion  should  have  been
            exercised differently will normally depend on  whether  on  the
            facts found the steps taken by  the  Secretary  of  State  were
            disproportionate to the need to protect national security".


26.   In our judgment, in these passages, Lord Slynn made  it  clear  that,
      whilst it is for the Secretary of State  in  the  first  instance  to
      decide whether an individual's deportation is conducive to the public
      good and whether to exercise the discretion  to  make  a  deportation
      order, the appellate body has jurisdiction to consider  the  exercise
      of discretion to make  a  deportation  order  and  in  doing  so  can
      consider for itself whether an individual's deportation is  conducive
      to the public good.

27.   We do not consider that the changes in the statutory language in  the
      rights of appeal since 2001 should lead us to a different conclusion:

      i)    First, under both the 1971 Act and the  2002  Act  the  decision
           under appeal is the decision to make a deportation order  rather
           than any prior decision that a person is liable to deportation.

      ii)   Second, the approach  in  SIAC  applying  the  Rehman  case  has
           remained the same despite the amendments to the SIAC Act 1997 so
           that the right of appeal under section 2 of  that  Act  reflects
           section 82 of the 2002 Act.

      iii)   Third,  section  85(6)  gives  the  Tribunal  broad  powers  to
           "consider evidence about any matter which it thinks relevant  to
           the substance of  the  decision"  and  such  a  power  would  be
           emasculated if the Tribunal was unable to  consider  for  itself
           the factual basis on which  the  decision  to  deport  was  made
           (namely what it is  that  makes  the  appellant  liable  to  the
           exercise of the power).

      iv)   Fourth, by section 86(3) the Tribunal:-

                  "must allow the appeal in so far as it thinks that-
                 a)    a decision against which the  appeal  is  brought  is
                       not  in  accordance  with  the  law  (including   any
                       immigration rules) or
                 b)    a discretion exercised in making a  decision  against
                       which the appeal is brought or is  treated  as  being
                       brought should have been exercised differently".


      Even if both the factual evaluation and  the  exercise  of  judgement
      that leads the Secretary of State to conclude that a person is liable
      to deportation are conceptually different from the decision to deport
      a person, they cannot in our judgment be entirely separated  from  it
      and an assessment that a person is liable to deportation is  part  of
      the decision to deport  and  certainly  "a  discretion  exercised  in
      making a decision" to deport  as  indeed  the  Secretary  of  State's
      reasons for making the present decision demonstrate.

28.   Further, we note our view  coincides  with  that  of  an  established
      textbook in this field.  Para 12.26 of Immigration  Law  &  Practice,
      Fourth edition (2008), by David Jackson, George Warr,  Julia  Onslow-
      Cole and Joseph Middleton, states:

            "Deportation conducive to the public good

            12.26       There is no objectively  established  pre-requisite
          on which liability on this  ground  is   based.  It  is  for  the
          Secretary of State to show both the prerequisite  for  the  power
          exists and, if so, that the power to deport should be  exercised.
          In order to deport, the Secretary of State  must  establish  that
          the facts are such that the power to deport exists...."

29.   In his written submissions in response to two questions posed  by  the
      Tribunal. In issuing directions  for  this  case   Mr  Singh  for  the
      Secretary of State had submitted as follows:

        "Q What if anything does the respondent have to  establish  to  the
           satisfaction of the appellate body before it can  be  determined
           that the appellant's deportation  is  conducive  to  the  public
           good?


        A. The respondent submits that there is nothing as  such  that  she
           needs to establish. The correct approach is that set out  in  EO
           [Turkey]...


        Q  What is the standard of proof to be applied to anything that the
           respondent has to establish?"


        A  As there  is  nothing  for  the  respondent  to  establish,  the
           question of the relevant standard of proof does not arise."

30.   We explored the matter in oral  argument  and  in  the  light  of  the
      observations in the SIAC cases. Mr. Singh agreed that the approach  in
      EO (Turkey) should  be  amended.  We  are  grateful  for  his  revised
      submissions to the effect that:

              i) the Secretary of State's decision to deport  an  individual
                 is taken when the factual foundation for it  is  such  that
                 she considers that the threshold for deportation action  on
                 conducive to public good grounds is reached.


             ii) On appeal, the Tribunal decides for itself whether  on  the
                 facts found that deportation is conducive  to  public  good
                 and that, in reaching its decision,  the  Tribunal  is  not
                 bound by the Secretary of State's view of  the  seriousness
                 of the offences in question.

           iii)  Where  any assertion of fact by  the  Secretary  of  State
                 material  to  the  assessment  of  whether  deportation  is
                 conducive to the public good  is in  dispute,  it  must  be
                 established by her on the civil standard of the balance  of
                 probabilities.


31.   We agree with these three propositions. A decision to deport a  person
      who is not a British citizen is founded on  a  certain  assessment  of
      facts and  a  view  taken  that  conduct  character  and  associations
      revealed by that  factual  assessment  reach  a  standard  that  makes
      deportation appropriate subject to  a  human  rights  claim  or  other
      relevant considerations in opposition to the  decision.  It  is  clear
      that the Secretary of State may be called on to justify her assessment
      of the factual foundation for the decision, if disputed. It  therefore
      follows that the Tribunal can reach a different decision as to whether
      a person is liable to deportation.  We will give further consideration
      to the standard of proof below. We recognise that all this would  need
      to be done if the deportation decision was challenged on human  rights
      grounds but we conclude it can and may also be done irrespective of  a
      response to deportation based on the human rights of an appellant.  As
      a  matter  of  first  principles,  common  law   fairness,   statutory
      construction and the application of the SIAC case law,  the  Secretary
      of State is not entitled to merely declare that a person is liable  to
      deportation  and  require  that  assessment  to  be  accepted  by  the
      appellate body without scrutiny. We do not understand that the AIT  in
      EO (Turkey) was considering such matters, but  if  this  was  not  the
      case, this part of the decision needs reconsideration and revision  as
      set in paragraph 68 below.

Issue 1 - ii) Appellate scrutiny of the exercise of discretion

32.   So far we have been  concerned  with  the  factual  foundation  of  an
      assessment that deportation is appropriate, but it  follows  from  our
      conclusion that the decision that someone should be deported  involves
      the exercise of a discretion that he is liable to deportation means it
      is open to the Tribunal to conclude  that  the  discretion  should  be
      exercised differently. If the Secretary of State were to conclude that
      a long term lawfully resident and settled migrant should  be  deported
      because of a sequence of parking fines, the Tribunal would be entitled
      to conclude that even if the factual predicate  was  established,  the
      threshold of seriousness was not met to justify the exercise  of  this
      power.

33.   In the present case, one submission that was addressed  to  us  by  Mr
      Jacobs apart from the sufficiency of  the  evidential  basis  for  the
      decision was that it was inconsistent with the  Secretary  of  State's
      published policy. We accept that one reason why a Tribunal  judge  may
      decide that a different view should be taken  from  the  Secretary  of
      State as to whether a person is liable to deportation is where such  a
      decision is contrary to the terms of an applicable policy.

34.   The Secretary of State  has  a  policy  in  respect  of  discretionary
      deportation which  sets  out  the  circumstances  in  which  she  will
      consider  it  appropriate  to  treat  an  individual  as   liable   to
      deportation and to make a decision to  deport.  This  is  set  out  in
      Chapters 11 to 15 of the Enforcement Instructions and  Guidance,  last
      updated 25 January 2010. The relevant chapters are Chapter 12  and  an
      unnumbered chapter which appears between Chapters 14 and 15, which are
      both reproduced at Appendices B and C to this determination.

35.   It is clear from the policy that, in cases which  do  not  fall  under
      the automatic deportation  provisions,  the  Secretary  of  State  may
      decide that an individual's deportation is conducive  to  public  good
      if:

      (a)   (para 12.1 of Chapter 12) he has been convicted of one  serious
           offence; or

      (b)   (para 12.1 of Chapter 12) he has several convictions  for  less
           serious crimes which, taken together  and  weighed  against  any
           compassionate circumstance, merit deportation; or

      (c)   (first paragraph of the unnumbered chapter) from 1 August 2008,
           he has been convicted in  the  United  Kingdom  and  received  a
           custodial sentence of any length for any  one  of  the  offences
           relating to the supply of Class A, B or C drugs that are  listed
           in that chapter.

36.   It follows therefore  that  a  single  criminal  conviction  for  one
      "serious offence" , the sentence  for  which  does  not  attract  the
      automatic deportation provisions, may nevertheless  justifiably  lead
      to deportation action on "conducive  to  the  public  good"  grounds.
      Several  convictions  for  less  serious  crimes  may  also   justify
      deportation on "conducive to the public good" grounds.

37.   Mr. Jacobs submitted that both under the Secretary of State's  policy
      and under the general principles circumscribing the exercise  of  the
      power to deport as conducive  to  the  public  good  the  appellant's
      criminal convictions were not such  as  to  justify  the  deportation
      action. He submitted that deportation action could only be  taken  on
      the basis of proven  past  conduct  and  could  not  be  taken  as  a
      precautionary or preventative measure  except  in  national  security
      cases, where the SIAC procedure applies.

38.   We accept further that where there is an applicable policy a  failure
      to act in accordance with it or to explain a departure from  it,  may
      mean that the decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  law,  applying
      general  public  law  principles.  However,  we  conclude  that  this
      decision was neither contrary to policy nor some implicit  limitation
      of when a decision can be made that a person is liable to deportation
      on conducive grounds.

39.   First, the terms of the policy itself, make  clear  that  a  criminal
      conviction is not a prerequisite for a decision that  deportation  is
      conducive to the public good. This is because the policy specifically
      states (with our emphasis):


         "The Secretary of State may decide that a person's deportation is
         conducive to the public good if (amongst other things):


           ?     he has been convicted of a serious offence or has a series
             of comparatively minor convictions and where the court did not
             recommend deportation;


           ?     he has obtained indefinite leave to  remain  by  deception
             (but see also: Administrative Removal Procedures chapter 51)"

40.   Properly construed, the  further  elaboration  of  the  Secretary  of
      State's policy (Appendices B and C to this determination) merely sets
      out the approach the Secretary of State will take where an individual
      has been convicted of criminal offences. It  does  not  say  anything
      about the approach the Secretary of State will take in  other  cases,
      nor  does  it  state  that  deportation  action  is  not   considered
      appropriate unless an individual has been convicted at least once. In
      any event, in this case, even  apart  from  the  allegation  of  gang
      membership,  this  appellant  has  a  sequence  of  convictions  that
      cumulatively could have brought him within the ambit  of  the  policy
      even if it were to read as circumscribing the exercise of the power.

41.   Second, the body of case law on public good deportation has  included
      authoritative statements that conduct such as entering a marriage  of
      convenience or using other forms of deception can constitute  conduct
      that can result in  a  lawful  decision  to  deport  irrespective  of
      whether there has been a criminal conviction  (see  R  v  Immigration
      Appeal Tribunal ex parte Cheema and others [1982] Imm AR 124 at  131;
      R v Abdul Karim [1986] Imm AR  428  at  430-434;  Immigration  Appeal
      Tribunal v Patel [1988] Imm AR 434).

42.   Third, we conclude that the distinction between national security and
      other cases where continued presence may  be  said  to  endanger  the
      public is not as clear cut as Mr Jacobs submits. Until the passage of
      the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act  1997,  the  power  to
      deport in security cases was the same as in other classes  of  public
      good deportation;  it  was  simply  the  right  of  appeal  that  was
      excluded. The power was exercised  without  judicial  disapproval  in
      cases where a person had been acquitted of serious  criminality  (see
      Re Amanullah Khan [1986] Imm AR 485 at 488).  In the case  of  Chahal
      that led to the passage of the Special immigration Appeals Commission
      Act 1997, there had no been criminal charges brought (see [1993]  Imm
      AR 362).  This was also the  situation  pertaining  in  the  case  of
      Rehman (above), the first decision that went on appeal under the SIAC
      Act 1997.

43.   In national security cases,  the  individual's  deportation  must  be
      conducive to the public good on national security grounds.  In  other
      cases, it is not necessary to show that deportation is  conducive  to
      the public good on national security grounds, as long as it is  shown
      that deportation is conducive to the public good.

44.   In Rehman at 17 Lord Slynn said that:

           "This is an area where it seems to  me  particularly  that  the
        Secretary of State can claim that a preventative or  precautionary
        action is justified. If an act is capable of creating indirectly a
        real possibility of harm to national security it is  in  principle
        wrong to say that the state must wait until action is taken  which
        has a direct effect against the United Kingdom".

45.   In our view, it does not follow, from the mere fact that Rehman was a
      national security case, that deportation action on a preventative  or
      precautionary basis is precluded in other cases.   As we  have  said,
      there is nothing in section 3(5) and (6) and 5(1)  of  the  1971  Act
      that requires there to have been any convictions at all. It would  be
      absurd to imagine that a person susceptible to the  power  to  deport
      who announced an intention to cause harm to  members  of  the  public
      could not be made the subject of a decision to deport until he or she
      had either been prosecuted for the threat  or  carried  out  the  act
      threatened. Deportation of aliens  is  a  measure  that  pursues  the
      legitimate aim of prevention of crime and disorder  under  Article  8
      (2) of the European Convention on Human Right, and that is an  aspect
      of preventative rather than penal justice.

Issue 2 - proof of allegations of conduct

46.   In the instant case, the Secretary  of  State  wishes  to  rely  upon
      information about the individual's actual or potential activities and
      connections which fall short of criminal conduct or  which  have  not
      resulted in any criminal convictions but which the Secretary of State
      considers makes an individual liable to deportation and justifies the
      exercise of the discretion to make  a  deportation  order.  In  other
      words, the Secretary of State considers that, in  the  light  of  the
      individual's character, conduct and/or associations, his  deportation
      is conducive to the public good. It is possible that this  may  arise
      even  where  the  intended  deportee  does  not  have  any   criminal
      convictions at all.

47.   The question then arises whether, in an appeal before  the  Tribunal,
      the Secretary of State is  permitted  to  rely  upon  allegations  of
      criminal conduct which have not resulted in criminal proceedings even
      if this involves the admission of hearsay evidence and evidence  from
      unnamed or undisclosed sources or anonymous sources. Here, the  panel
      permitted the Secretary of State to rely upon the evidence of  police
      officers who, in turn, relied upon the evidence of sources which  the
      officers refused to  disclose  in  evidence,  thus  diminishing   the
      appellant's ability  to  test  the  evidence.  If  such  evidence  is
      admissible, what  is  the  approach  the  Tribunal  should  adopt  in
      assessing the evidence and the standard of proof  to  be  applied  in
      determining whether any allegations of criminal conduct  are  proven?
      We turn to consider these questions in turn.

(i)   Admissibility of  hearsay  evidence,  evidence  from  undisclosed  or
      anonymous sources

48.   The starting point is rule 51 of the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal
      (Procedure) Rules 2005 (the FTT Procedure Rules),  which  insofar  as
      relevant provides:

            "51   Evidence
            (1)   The Tribunal may allow oral, documentary or other evidence
             to be given of any fact which appears to  be  relevant  to  an
             appeal or an application for bail, even if that evidence would
             be inadmissible in a court of law.
            (7)   Subject to section 108 of the 2002 Act, the Tribunal  must
             not take account of  any  evidence  that  has  not  been  made
             available to all the parties."

49.   The strict rules of evidence which apply in civil or criminal  courts
      do not apply in proceedings before the  First-tier  Tribunal.  It  is
      evident from rule 51(1) that the only criteria for the  admissibility
      of evidence is  whether  it  is  relevant.   It  is  a  further  well
      recognised principle of law that the  police  and  other  authorities
      charged  with  investigating  crime  and  protecting  the  public  or
      sections of it, are not required  to  disclose  the  identity  of  an
      informant.  Lord Diplock in D v NSPCC [1978] AC 171  at  218  put  it
      thus:

            "By the uniform practice of the judges which  by  the  time  of
        Marks v. Beyfus, (1890) 25 QBD 494, had already  hardened  into  a
        rule of law, the balance has fallen on the side of  non-disclosure
        except where upon trial of a  defendant  for  a  criminal  offence
        disclosure of the identity of the informer could help to show that
        the defendant was innocent of the offence. In that  case,  and  in
        that case only, the balance falls on the side of disclosure."

      (See also the discussion in Cross and Tapper on Evidence 12th edition
      (2010) p488 et seq).

50.   In V v Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  [2009]  EWHC  1902  (Admin),
      delivered on 24 July 2009, Hickinbottom J. considered rule 51(7).  In
      that case, the Secretary of State wished to rely upon  evidence  that
      the claimant was a member of a  criminal  gang  and,  in  particular,
      evidence of his involvement in the murder of a 15-year old person  in
      2006, the brandishing of a sawn-off shotgun earlier in the evening of
      that murder, three spent convictions and criminal intelligence  which
      purportedly showed the claimant as  being  associated  with  criminal
      gangs. Hickinbottom J. concluded that it was open to the Secretary of
      State to rely upon evidence showing that the claimant, even if he did
      not commit the murder, was associated with those who did and that  it
      was not an abuse for the Secretary of State  to  rely  upon  evidence
      from anonymous witnesses and from official intelligence,  saying,  at
      para 46  of  the  judgment,  that  evidence  from  anonymous  sources
      inevitably lost considerable weight by being anonymous and, in  part,
      hearsay,  thus  preventing  any  direct  challenge  to  the  relevant
      witnesses. However, his Lordship said that he could not say that  the
      evidence must inevitably be given no weight by the Tribunal  or  that
      to admit the evidence at all would inevitably  deny  the  claimant  a
      fair hearing.

51.   At para 29 of his skeleton argument, Mr. Jacobs contends that V was a
      permission decision and hence not binding. The argument  that  V  was
      merely a permission decision is misconceived, as it is clear that the
      case  was  a  rolled  up  hearing,  at  which  his  Lordship  granted
      permission  to  judicially  review  but  dismissed  the   substantive
      application. Whether a decision of an Administrative Court judge in a
      rolled up hearing is strictly binding on the Upper Tribunal,  is  not
      something we need resolve in this hearing, but at the  very  least  a
      reasoned decision on the point is highly  persuasive  and  should  be
      followed by this Tribunal unless it can be said to be  plainly  wrong
      (R. v Manchester Coroner, ex parte Tal (1985) QB 67).  This  decision
      is clearly not plainly wrong and we agree with it and follow it.

52.   The sub-ordinate argument in  the  same  paragraph  of  the  skeleton
      argument, that  V  can  be  distinguished  on  the  ground  that  the
      Secretary  of  State's  case  in  V  was  not  primarily  based  upon
      undisclosed intelligence, is also misconceived, as this goes  to  the
      weight to be given to the evidence relied upon by  the  Secretary  of
      State; it does not justify excluding relevant evidence.

53.   We are not aware of any authority for the proposition  that  evidence
      which is relevant must nevertheless be  excluded  if  it  is  hearsay
      evidence or it is based, directly or  indirectly,  on  evidence  from
      unnamed or anonymous sources or if it leads to difficulties  for  the
      appellant in dealing with it. Mr. Jacobs cannot rely on jurisprudence
      relating to the right of fair trial in Article 6 of the ECHR (see Al-
      Khawaja and Taheery v United Kingdom (Application Nos.  26766/05  and
      22228/06) (2012) 54 EHRR 23, [2012] Crim L. R.  375)  because  it  is
      well established that deportation proceedings  are  neither  criminal
      proceedings nor  involve  the  determination  of  a  civil  right  or
      obligation (Maaouia v France (Application  No.  39652/98)  (2001)  33
      EHRR 42).

54.   Clearly, these matters affect the weight to be given to such evidence
      - the greater the difficulty in assessing its  reliability  the  less
      the weight that can properly be given to it. Moreover, whether or not
      the proceedings come within Article 6, in our judgment, they need  to
      meet minimum standards of fairness in order to be in accordance  with
      the law.

55.    However,  both  these   considerations   are   separate   from   the
      admissibility of the evidence. Indeed, rule 51 suggests that the only
      criteria for admissibility or otherwise is whether  the  evidence  is
      relevant and has been made available to both parties. The question is
      whether an individual's deportation is conducive to the public  good.
      The Tribunal is entitled to have regard to such evidence before it as
      is relevant to that question, giving  such  weight  as  it  considers
      appropriate bearing in mind the  quality  of  the  evidence  and  the
      difficulty in challenging it when it  is  hearsay  evidence  or  from
      anonymous sources. We do  not  accept  that  the  admission  of  such
      evidence would deny an appellant a fair hearing.

56.   Although rule 51(1) of the  FTT  Procedures  Rules  states  that  the
      Tribunal  "may  allow  .......   evidence   which   appears   to   be
      relevant....", this does not  in  our  judgment  confer  a  power  or
      discretion to exclude relevant evidence that was provided in time  on
      the  basis  that  it  presents  difficulties  for  the  appellant  in
      challenging it. Indeed in civil proceedings the general rule is  that
      relevant evidence is admissible and there is no power to exclude such
      evidence (see Cross and Tapper on Evidence 12th  edition  (2010)  p64
      -74).

57.   Mr. Jacobs sought to draw an analogy between the procedure  which  is
      available in the criminal jurisdiction for the  Crown  to  apply  for
      material to be withheld from the defendant in certain cases where the
      public interest requires it, for example, in order to protect sources
      of information. There is an established procedure for this process in
      the criminal jurisdiction, which provides  safeguards  to  avoid  the
      risk of an unfair trial or miscarriage of justice. He also sought  to
      draw an analogy with deportation decisions made on national  security
      grounds, appeals against which are heard before  SIAC.  SIAC  appeals
      often lead to "open" and "closed judgments". The  "closed"  judgments
      concern evidence which has not been disclosed to  the  appellant  but
      which he  is  able  to  test  through  his  special  advocate.  These
      analogies  are  misconceived.  Proceedings  before   the   First-tier
      Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal are not criminal proceedings or  SIAC
      appeals. Not only is it the case  that  there  is  no  provision  for
      evidence to be admitted by a judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  which
      is not disclosed to all parties (except in relation to section 108 of
      the 2002 Act which is not relevant for present purposes), rule  51(7)
      expressly prohibits a judge from taking into account  evidence  which
      has not been made available to all parties.

58.   Our conclusion  in relation to the admissibility of such evidence  is
      in line with the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  MB  (admissible
      evidence; interview records) Iran [2012] UKUT 00019 (IAC), heard on 6
      February  2012  but  reported  since  the  hearing  before  us.   For
      completeness we note rule 15(2)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008 (the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules) states:

            "(2)  The Upper Tribunal may -


                  (a)  admit evidence whether or not -
                       (i)   the evidence would be  admissible  in  a  civil
                     trial in the United Kingdom; or
                       (ii)   the  evidence  was  available  to  a  previous
                     decision maker; or


                  (b)  exclude evidence that would otherwise  be  admissible
                 where -
                       (i)   the evidence was not provided within  the  time
                     allowed by a direction or a practice direction;
                       (ii)  the evidence was otherwise provided in a manner
                     that did not comply with  a  direction  or  a  practice
                     direction; or
                       (iii) it would  otherwise  be  unfair  to  admit  the
                     evidence."

59.   In our judgment rule 15(2)(b)(iii) does not confer  a  discretion  on
      the Upper Tribunal to exclude relevant evidence which  could  not  be
      excluded by the First-tier Tribunal. The sub rule is to  be  read  in
      context as dealing with the manner in which the new material comes to
      be relied upon. Overall rule 15(2) is dealing with  cases  where  the
      material was served too late, in breach of directions or as a  result
      of some other procedural failing that would make its receipt unfair.


(ii)  The standard of proof

60.   As we have said above, the fact that  evidence  is  hearsay  evidence
      and/or that it emanates from unnamed or anonymous sources so that the
      extent of the  appellant's  ability  to  challenge  allegations  made
      against him is diminished, are all factors which affect the weight to
      be given to the evidence. The Tribunal, when assessing this evidence,
      should bear these difficulties in mind.

61.   Mr Jacobs submitted that a criminal standard or a high civil standard
      of proof was engaged as the liberty of a lawfully resident alien  was
      imperilled by the decision under challenge. Again we are assisted  by
      the judgment in Rehman in which the following passages are relevant:

      Lord Slynn:

      "22.  Here the liberty of the person and the practice  of  his  family
             to remain in this country is at stake and when  specific  acts
             which have already occurred are relied on,  fairness  requires
             that they should be proved to the civil standard of proof. But
             that is not the whole exercise. The  Secretary  of  State,  in
             deciding whether it is conducive to the  public  good  that  a
             person should be deported, is entitled to have regard  to  all
             the  information  in  his  possession  about  the  actual  and
             potential  activities  and  the  connections  of  the   person
             concerned. He is entitled to have regard to the  precautionary
             and preventative principles rather than to wait until directly
             harmful activities have taken place,  the  individual  in  the
             meantime remaining in this country. In  doing  so  he  is  not
             merely finding facts but forming  an  executive  judgement  or
             assessment. There must be material  on  which  proportionately
             and  reasonably  he  can  conclude  that  there  is   a   real
             possibility of activities harmful to national security but  he
             does not have to be satisfied, nor on appeal to show, that all
             the material before him  is  proved,  and  his  conclusion  is
             justified,  to  a  "high   civil   degree   of   probability".
             Establishing a degree of probability does not seem relevant to
             the reaching of a conclusion on  whether  there  should  be  a
             deportation for the public good.

      23.   Contrary to Mr Kadri's argument this approach is  not  confusing
             proof of facts with the exercise of  discretion-specific  acts
             must be proved, and an assessment made of  the  whole  picture
             and then the discretion exercised as to whether  there  should
             be a decision to deport and a deportation order made.

      Lord Steyn:

      "29.  That brings me to the next  issue.  Counsel  for  the  appellant
             submitted that the civil standard of proof  is  applicable  to
             the Secretary of State and to the  Commission.  This  argument
             necessarily  involves  the  proposition  that  even   if   the
             Secretary of State is fully entitled to be  satisfied  on  the
             materials before him that the person concerned may be  a  real
             threat to national security, the Secretary of  State  may  not
             deport him. That cannot be right. The task of the Secretary of
             State is to evaluate risks in  respect  of  the  interests  of
             national  security.  Lord  Woolf  expressed  the  point   with
             precision as follows, at p 1254, para 44:

                 "in any national security case the Secretary  of  State  is
                 entitled to make a decision to deport not only on the basis
                 that  the  individual  has  in  fact  endangered   national
                 security but that he is a danger to national security. When
                 the case is being put in this way, it is necessary  not  to
                 look only at the individual  allegations  and  ask  whether
                 they have been proved. It is also necessary to examine  the
                 case as a whole against an individual and then ask  whether
                 on a  global  approach  that  individual  is  a  danger  to
                 national security,  taking  into  account  the  executive's
                 policy with regard to national security. When this is done,
                 the cumulative effect may establish that the individual  is
                 to be treated as a danger, although it cannot be proved  to
                 a high degree of probability  that  he  has  performed  any
                 individual act which would justify this conclusion. Here it
                 is important to  remember  that  the  individual  is  still
                 subject to immigration control.  He  is  not  in  the  same
                 position as a British citizen. He has not been charged with
                 a specific criminal offence. It  is  the  danger  which  he
                 constitutes to national security which is  to  be  balanced
                 against his own personal interests."

            The dynamics of the role of  the  Secretary  of  State,  charged
             with the power and duty to consider deportation on grounds  of
             national security, irresistibly supports this analysis.  While
             I came to this conclusion by the end of  the  hearing  of  the
             appeal, the tragic events of 11 September  2001  in  New  York
             reinforce compellingly that no other approach is possible."

62.   The question of the standard  of  proof,  discussed  in  Rehman,  was
      recently considered by SIAC  (chaired  by  Mitting  J)  in  Ekaterina
      Zatuliveter v SSHD [2011] UKSIAC 103/2010, at paras  5  to  8,  which
      read:

        "5.      Rehman  does  not  provide  a  definitive  answer  to  the
             question  posed  by  this  case.  For  present  purposes,   it
             definitively established three propositions: it was  an  error
             of law to hold that the decision of the Secretary of State had
             to be justified by individual facts proved to a high degree of
             probability; in assessing future risk, the Secretary of  State
             was entitled, and the Commission was  obliged,  to  take  into
             account all relevant material, including that  not  proved  to
             any particular standard; and great weight must always be given
             to the views of  the  Secretary  of  State  and  her  security
             advisors on matters of national security. (Per Lord  Slynn  at
             paragraphs 22 and 26, per Lord Steyn at paragraph 29, per Lord
             Hoffmann at paragraphs 48,  49  and  57,  per  Lord  Clyde  at
             paragraph 63 and per Lord Hutton at paragraph 65).  The  House
             was, however, divided on the question of the standard of proof
             by reference to which past events should be established. Lords
             Slynn and Steyn stated that "when  specific  acts  which  have
             already occurred are relied on, fairness  requires  that  they
             should be proved to the civil standard of  proof":  paragraphs
             22 and 27. Lords Hoffmann and Clyde considered that  the  task
             of the Commission was ordinarily to determine whether  or  not
             there was  a  factual  basis  for  the  Secretary  of  State's
             decision  and  whether  her  opinion  was  one   which   could
             reasonably be entertained: paragraphs  54,  57  and  63.  Lord
             Hutton  can  be  taken  either  to  have  agreed   with   both
             propositions or, expressly, with  neither.  Accordingly,  save
             for the correction of the error of requiring past fact  to  be
             determined to a high degree of probability,  Rehman  does  not
             determine the approach which should be adopted to past  facts;
             nor does it determine the approach of the  Commission  to  the
             assessment of future risk where that risk is solely  dependent
             upon what has occurred in the past - as in this case.


        6. We must therefore return to first principles  to  determine  the
             approach  which  we   should   take.   We   start   with   two
             considerations, of which the first derives from  the  speeches
             in Rehman and the second is based on  the  experience  of  the
             Commission since Rehman: the ultimate task of  the  Commission
             is evaluative; and the circumstances  which  give  rise  to  a
             decision to deport or exclude on conducive grounds for reasons
             of national security are many and varied - as is the evidence,
             information  and  intelligence  upon   which   we   make   our
             evaluation. This suggests that  a  degree  of  flexibility  of
             approach  may  be  required.  Experience  has  shown  us  that
             attempting to  make  findings  of  past  fact  on  balance  of
             probabilities is invariably a good starting  point.  In  every
             case since Rehman (apart from certification  cases,  in  which
             there was a statutory threshold of  reasonable  suspicion)  we
             have been able to make findings of past  fact  on  balance  of
             probabilities;  but  it  is   not   impossible   to   envisage
             circumstances in which a decision to deport or  exclude  would
             be upheld even where no such finding adverse to  an  appellant
             could be made. For example, a decision to exclude  a  possible
             assassin, based only on information provided in good faith  by
             a friendly state, could be upheld even if  the  factual  basis
             for the reporting could not be established on the  balance  of
             probabilities. In such  a  case,  a  decision  adverse  to  an
             appellant would be more likely  to  be  made  if  he  did  not
             participate  constructively  in  the  appeal  -  as  sometimes
             happens. A significant feature of Rehman's case  was  that  he
             does not appear to have done so. In such cases, Mr.  Glasson's
             suggested tests, which are derived  from  two  sources  -  the
             wording of Article  1F  of  the  Refugee  Convention  and  the
             approach of tribunals to claims of past persecution  by  those
             seeking asylum - might be appropriate: they are  tests  to  be
             applied in circumstances in  which  the  facts  cannot  always
             readily be determined. It does not follow that the same  tests
             should apply in a case in which the evidence, information  and
             intelligence deployed by the Security Service is matched by  a
             constructive response, supported by detailed evidence,  by  an
             appellant. In such a case, we may well be able to reach secure
             findings of fact upon which our evaluation  can  be  made.  In
             some cases, the exercise can closely resemble the  traditional
             approach of a court determining a  civil  case  (albeit  under
             unusual procedural rules).


        7. This case falls into the latter category. We have been  able  to
             make findings of fact  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  on
             critical questions and, having done so, to reach  a  confident
             conclusion about the basic question of fact: is the  appellant
             a Russian agent?


        8. In answering that question and in evaluating the risk,  if  any,
             posed by the appellant  to  national  security,  we  have  not
             adopted the self-denying ordinance proposed by  Lord  Hoffmann
             in Rehman in paragraph 57 of  his  speech.  We  do  not,  with
             respect, accept his founding premise  that  the  Secretary  of
             State "has the advantage of a wide range of advice from people
             with day to day involvement  in  security  matters  which  the
             Commission, despite its specialist membership, cannot  match".
             For the reasons explained in paragraphs 3  -  11  of  Al-Jedda
             SC/66/2008, 7th April 2009, we believe that we  are  able  to,
             and do, give more careful and detailed scrutiny  to  the  risk
             posed by an individual appellant to national security than the
             Secretary of State can reasonably be expected to do.  We  have
             routinely applied the approach  favoured  by  Lord  Woolf,  at
             paragraph 44 of his judgment in Rehman  and  Lords  Slynn  and
             Steyn in paragraphs 22 and 23 and 30  of  their  speeches.  We
             will adopt the same approach in this case."

63.   Although  Mitting  J  considered  that  Rehman  does  not  provide  a
      definitive answer as to the applicable standard of proof in  relation
      to past acts, it is nevertheless  clear  that  it  does  not  provide
      support for the proposition that a standard of proof higher than  the
      civil standard of the balance of probability applies,  even  if  such
      past acts are alleged to  be  of  criminal  conduct.  We  reject  Mr.
      Jacobs' argument to this effect. However, relying upon the  judgments
      of Lords Slynn and Steyn, we consider that  any  specific  acts  that
      have already occurred in the past must be proven by the Secretary  of
      State, and proven to the civil standard of a balance of  probability.
      The civil standard  is  flexible  according  to  the  nature  of  the
      allegations made, see House of Lords in Re B [2008] UKHL  35,  and  a
      Tribunal judge should be astute to ensure that proof of a proposition
      is not degraded into speculation of the possibility of its accuracy.

64.   As to the assessment  of  future  risk  based  on  past  conduct,  we
      conclude the panel was right to apply a standard of reasonable degree
      of likelihood.  The  judgment  in  Rehman  suggests  that,  where  an
      assessment of the future risk is being made, something less than  the
      civil standard  of  the  balance  of  probability  applies  (see,  in
      particular,  para  22).  We  say  this  because  it   suggests   that
      deportation will be conducive to the public good  if  the  cumulative
      effect of the material  before  the  Tribunal  is  such  that,  after
      considering the individual's own personal circumstances, the Tribunal
      proportionately  and  reasonably  concludes,  on  the  whole  of  the
      material  before  it  as  to  the  past  and  the  future,  that  the
      individual's deportation is conducive to the public good.

65.   We summarise our conclusions as follows. We are satisfied that  where
      the Secretary of  State  seeks  to  exercise  the  power  to  make  a
      deportation decision against a person who is not a British citizen or
      otherwise exempt under the Immigration Acts, she must first  identify
      the factual basis for the exercise  of  the  power  in  the  decision
      letter or amplified reasons  for  the  decision;  second,  where  the
      factual basis is contested she  must  satisfy  the  Tribunal  of  the
      factual basis on the balance of probabilities.  Third,  any  material
      relevant to meet that  standard  may  be  received  by  the  Tribunal
      whether it is hearsay or a summary of information held by others,  if
      it is supplied  in  time  and  in  accordance  with  case  management
      directions but the weight to be attached to such material will depend
      on its nature,  the  circumstances  in  which  it  was  collected  or
      recorded, the susceptibility of the informant or  original  informant
      to error, and the extent to which the appellant is able to comment or
      rebut it.

66.   At this point there is a significant distinction between  proceedings
      in the Tribunal and before SIAC. The rules make no general provisions
      for secret hearings in the Upper Tribunal, and any material that  the
      Secretary of State seeks to rely on before the Tribunal in support of
      the decision to deport ought to be disclosed to the appellant and his
      representatives. Although we have not  heard  full  argument  of  the
      issue we do not consider that rule 14 (2) of the  Tribunal  Procedure
      (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  applies  to  this  class  of  case  and
      enables the Secretary of State to produce to the Tribunal and rely on
      material that is not to be provided to the  appellant  or  his  legal
      representatives. We recognise that in a variety of Tribunal  appeals,
      the Tribunal may need to direct that information that is confidential
      or would cause harm if a party knew about it, the Tribunal may direct
      its non disclosure if "having regards to the  interests  of  justice,
      that it is proportionate  to  give  such  a  direction"  (see  Jacobs
      'Tribunal Practice and Procedure' 2009 at 493-496).  However, in  our
      judgment it is contrary to the interests of justice for the Secretary
      of State to discharge the evidential burden to establish the  factual
      basis for the exercise of the power to deport in the public interest,
      by submitting material to the tribunal that is not disclosed  to  the
      appellant or his advocate. There is no such power in  the  First-tier
      Tribunal where non-disclosure is restricted  by  rule  54(2)  to  the
      circumstances set out in section 108 of  the  2002  Act  (methods  of
      detection of forged documents). In other cases the Secretary of State
      will have to use the SIAC procedure or any other deviation  from  the
      basic rules of fairness permitted by primary legislation.

67.   In any event we clarified in advance of the hearing that neither  the
      First-tier Tribunal nor ourselves have been  party  to  any  material
      that has not been  provided  to  the  appellant.  The  issue  in  the
      remaining part of this determination will  be  whether  the  material
      that was before the panel was such that they were entitled  to  reach
      the findings they did upon  it.  Before  turning  to  that  analysis,
      however, we propose to set out the steps  to  determine  a  conducive
      deport appeal and in doing so  we  broaden  the  guidance  previously
      given in EO (Turkey).

Conclusions on the appellate jurisdiction in conducive appeals

68.   The sequence of decision making set out in EO (Turkey) still  applies
      but the first step is expanded as follows:

           i) Consider whether the person is liable to be deported  on  the
              grounds set out by the Secretary of State. This will normally
              involve the judge examining:-


                         a. Whether  the  material  facts  alleged  by  the
                            Secretary of State  are  accepted  and  if  not
                            whether  they   are  made  out  to  the   civil
                            standard flexibly applied;
                         b. Whether on the facts established  viewed  as  a
                            whole the  conduct  character  or  associations
                            reach such a level of seriousness as to justify
                            a decision to deport;
                         c. In considering b) the judge will  take  account
                            of any lawful policy of the Secretary of  State
                            relevant to the exercise of the  discretion  to
                            deport and  whether  the  discretion  has  been
                            exercised in accordance with that policy;


          ii) If the  person  is  liable  to  deportation,  then  the  next
              question to consider is whether a human rights or  protection
              claim precludes deportation. In cases of  private  or  family
              life, this will require an assessment of the  proportionality
              of the  measures  against  the  family  or  private  life  in
              question, and a weighing of all relevant factors.


         iii) If the two previous steps are decided against the  appellant,
              then the question whether the discretion to deport  has  been
              exercised in accordance with the Immigration Rules applicable
              is the third step in the process. The present drafting of the
              rules assumes that a person who is liable to deportation  and
              whose deportation would not be contrary to  the  law  and  in
              breach of human rights should  normally  be  deported  absent
              exceptional circumstances to be assessed by the  Tribunal  in
              the light of all relevant information placed before them.

Applying this approach to the instant case:

69.   For the reasons we have given above, we are satisfied that the  panel
      did not err in law in permitting the Secretary of State to rely  upon
      the evidence of the police witnesses and reports, which was based  on
      hearsay evidence, including the  evidence  of  unnamed  or  anonymous
      sources. The panel did not err in law in permitting the Secretary  of
      State to rely upon allegations of conduct which either fell short  of
      or had not resulted in criminal convictions. It is plain that, in its
      assessment of the evidence, the panel acknowledged that the fact that
      the evidence relied upon was hearsay evidence from anonymous  sources
      reduced the weight that should be given to it. It is plain  that,  in
      reaching its findings of fact, it took a global approach  to  all  of
      the evidence before it, assessing the credibility of the  appellant's
      explanations. It gave very full reasons for not finding  him  at  all
      credible and rejecting his explanations.

70.   The panel made its findings as to the appellant's involvement in past
      acts on a standard of proof higher than the  civil  standard  of  the
      balance of probability. The fact that it applied a higher standard of
      proof than was necessary does not give rise to any material error  of
      law in its determination of this appeal.

71.    It  is  also  plain  that,  in  assessing  whether  the  appellant's
      deportation was conducive to the public good, the panel's  assessment
      was forward looking. For example, at para 419, the  panel  said  that
      the appellant's involvement in gun, knife and other violent crime  is
      potentially extremely harmful to the communities the police  seek  to
      protect; and,  at  para  417,  it  said  that  the  appellant  was  a
      significant ongoing risk to the public. The panel considered the case
      against the appellant as a whole and, taking a  global  approach,  it
      found that it could proportionately and reasonably conclude that  the
      appellant's deportation was conducive to the public good.  The  panel
      was correct to apply the approach commended by the House of Lords  in
      Rehman even  though  this  was  not  a  case  where  the  conduct  or
      associations were said to imperil national security.

72.   Once the panel accepted  the  Secretary  of  State's  case  that  the
      appellant was closely associated with a violent gang it was  entitled
      to  conclude  that  his  character  conduct  and   associations   was
      sufficiently serious to make him eligible to deportation  subject  to
      the assessment of his human rights claim.

Subordinate arguments

73.   In our judgment, many of the  remaining  arguments  advanced  on  the
      appellant's behalf were misconceived.  We  have  already  dealt  with
      those of a general nature above (for example, in relation to ground 1
      and much of ground 2).  We  will  now  deal  with  the  case-specific
      arguments, to the extent we consider it necessary to do so. We do not
      intend to deal with the minute  detail  of  each  argument  or  every
      nuance of each ground.

74.   A fundamental misconception in much of the skeleton argument  is  the
      notion that the panel erred in relying upon  evidence  that  had  not
      been disclosed to the appellant. As we have made clear, the  Tribunal
      received no  evidence  that  had  not  also  been  disclosed  to  the
      appellant. No attempt was made to deal with the fact that rule 51  of
      the FTT Procedure Rules specifically  provides  for  evidence  to  be
      admitted if relevant and even if it would be inadmissible in a  court
      of law. As we have said above, there is no power to exclude  relevant
      evidence provided the other party has had an adequate opportunity  to
      consider it. As the Tribunal was not party to material the  appellant
      was unaware of, there was no need to consider special  procedures  to
      allow his interests to be represented.

75.   Furthermore, the grounds ignore the fact that the Secretary of  State
      disclosed to the panel and the appellant all of the evidence that was
      in her possession and upon which she based her decision to  deem  the
      appellant's deportation to be conducive to the  public  good  and  to
      exercise her decision to  issue  a  deportation  order  against  him.
      Clearly, there was undisclosed intelligence because the names of  the
      sources of information and the content of the reports  had  not  been
      disclosed. However, this  was  intelligence  which  the  Metropolitan
      Police had not disclosed to the Secretary  of  State.  There  was  no
      question of the Secretary of State relying upon evidence  before  the
      panel that had not been fully disclosed to the appellant.

76.   Para 12 of the skeleton argument refers to the  "necessarily  limited
      weight a reasonable Tribunal could give to undisclosed evidence .....
      and the appellant's submissions as to the quality of  the  evidence".
      It asserts that it is unclear how the Tribunal could reasonably  come
      to such a conclusion. These assertions simply ignore  the  fact  that
      the Tribunal specifically acknowledged, at para 372, that the  weight
      to be given to evidence from anonymous witnesses may  be  necessarily
      limited. The panel said that it  had  considered  the  evidence  with
      anxious scrutiny and it said that it had applied a global approach to
      the evidence. Contrary to that which is asserted at para  14  of  the
      skeleton argument, the panel did determine the extent of  the  future
      risk. At para 371, it found that, on the  balance  of  probabilities,
      the appellant was likely to re-offend. At para 417, it found that  he
      posed "a significant ongoing risk to the public and indeed  to  those
      with whom he is closely associated, having regard to the shooting  at
      his property, the shooting of the cousin [X] and the use of CS gas to
      subdue the appellant whilst his son was present".  At  para  419,  it
      found that he was "involved in criminality which extends  beyond  his
      own criminal convictions. His involvement in  gun,  knife  and  other
      violent crime is extremely harmful to the communities the police seek
      to protect".

77.   Para 15 of the skeleton argument asserts  that  it  is  unclear  what
      standard of proof the panel applied to the  findings  at  paras  344,
      349, 353, 370 and 373. We make two points. In the first place, it  is
      inappropriate to focus on isolated passages. The determination should
      be read as a whole. When read as a whole,  it  is  evident  that  the
      panel found that  it  was  satisfied,  even  to  a  "high  degree  of
      probability" that the appellant's criminal  activities  were  as  had
      been outlined to it in the Secretary of State's evidence and that  he
      is a gang member whose activities were as had  been  urged  upon  the
      panel by the Secretary of State (see, for example, para 368).  It  is
      plain therefore that the panel applied at least the civil standard of
      the balance of probabilities. At para 358, it said that it found  the
      appellant to be a gang member who had involved himself in all the non-
      convicted criminality detailed in the evidence of  the  three  police
      witnesses.

78.   Contrary to what is asserted in para 25 of the skeleton  argument  in
      relation to ground 3, the  appellant  could  and  did  challenge  the
      evidence relied upon by the Secretary  of  State.  The  determination
      describes the lengthy cross-examination of the police  witnesses  and
      the explanations the appellant advanced to rebut the evidence of  the
      Secretary of State. The panel plainly considered all of the  evidence
      in the round and with anxious scrutiny, acknowledging that the weight
      to be given to the material from anonymous witnesses may  necessarily
      be limited. It noted (para 354) that there were multiple intelligence
      reports before it which indicated that the appellant was a member  of
      the Anti-Showermen gang with access to  firearms  and  who  deals  in
      drugs. It noted that the  intelligence  reports  indicated  that  the
      appellant has targeted rival  gang  members  and  has  been  targeted
      himself. It found that these reports were highly unlikely to all have
      been made up. That was a finding that was fully open  to  it  on  the
      evidence, for the reasons it gave. The assertion at para  43  of  the
      skeleton argument, that the Secretary of State contended  before  the
      panel and the panel accepted that the  reports  relied  upon  by  the
      Secretary of State stand unchallenged and unchallengeable, is  simply
      wrong, for the reasons we have already given.

79.   Reliance upon rule 13(1)(c) of the FTT Procedure Rules (paras 42  and
      49 of the skeleton argument) is misconceived. The material  that  was
      in the possession of the Secretary of State and relied  upon  by  her
      was all disclosed. Mr. Singh confirmed this to be the  case  and  Mr.
      Jacobs accepted he had no reason to believe otherwise.

80.   There is no substance in ground 4, which asserts,  in  essence,  that
      the  panel  materially  erred  in  the  weight  it  attached  to  the
      undisclosed intelligence. Questions of weight are for the tribunal of
      fact to assess. It was for the panel to decide what weight to give to
      the evidence that was before it.

81.   There is no substance in ground 6, which  asserts  that  the  panel's
      approach to the evidence was so uniformly dismissive of every  aspect
      of the appellant's case that it called its objectivity into question.
      This is another way of saying that the panel was biased. However, the
      specific arguments marshalled in support of this  serious  allegation
      of bias amount to little more than expressions of  disagreement  with
      the panel's reasoning and an attempt to re-argue the case. The  panel
      drew inferences from the evidence it was entitled to draw; it did not
      speculate; it did not misapprehend  the  evidence.  When  read  as  a
      whole, it manifestly gave adequate reasons for its findings;  it  did
      not need to identify and comment upon every piece of evidence, giving
      reasons for accepting or rejecting it.

The human rights claim

82.   We turn to ground 5, which concerns the Article 8 assessment. To  the
      extent that the challenge to the panel's assessment of the Article  8
      claim is based on arguments we have dealt with above,  we  rely  upon
      what we have said above.

83.   The panel cited a great deal of the jurisprudence on the  application
      of  the  Article  8  balance  in  deportation  appeals.  They   heard
      submissions in January shortly before the  decision  of  the  Supreme
      Court in ZH (Tanzania) [2011]  UKSC  4  had  been  pronounced.  By  a
      supplementary note following the hearing the decision  was  drawn  to
      their attention but they did not receive detailed submissions on  how
      it applied. It did not have the assistance of the decision  of  Court
      of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in Case C-34/09 Ruiz Zambrano
      [2011] ECR 1-0000 8 March 2011 or the recent decision  of  the  Upper
      Tribunal in Sanade and others (British children - Zambrano -  Dereci)
      [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC).

84.   As for the appellant personally the panel concluded that respect  for
      his private life established over 18 years lawful residence and as  a
      very young  person  was  outweighed  by  his  persistent  history  of
      offending that continued  when he became an  adult  and  the  serious
      adverse nature  of  his  character  conduct  and  associations.  They
      concluded (para 414):

        "there  are  very  serious  reasons  to  justify  the  Appellant's
        expulsion. These range from his  educational  failure,  long  term
        unemployment, association with  criminals,  criminal  convictions,
        proximity to shootings, the exposure of his family to gang culture
        and its implications, contempt for  United  Kingdom  criminal  and
        immigration law and a clear statement of  refusal  to  accept  any
        form of assistance that might in any way improve his  private  and
        family life".

85.   As for his relations with his partner, as has already been noted  the
      panel did not find her credible and rejected the reasons put  forward
      as to why they did not live together when they had the opportunity to
      do so. They concluded that the couple  were  not  as  close  as  they
      claimed. In any event the partner was the sister of  a  gang  member.
      They were satisfied that she  was  fully  aware  of  the  appellant's
      activities. In the circumstances the panel  was  entitled  to  attach
      little weight to this relationship.

86.   Before us it was the impact of the appellant's removal on S that  has
      been stressed. But again the subsequent case law has  not  undermined
      the panel's conclusions. They noted that the appellant  was  not  the
      child's primary carer, the appellant did not live in a  family  unity
      with the child, and the appellant's conduct had exposed the child  to
      danger at times.  The child  was  very  young  at  the  date  of  the
      decision to deport and even now. In any event the serious  nature  of
      the appellant's conduct meant that the child's right to have  regular
      contact with his father in the United Kingdom was outweighed  by  the
      strength of the public interest in deporting him.

87.   Whilst with  the  benefit  of  the  subsequent  jurisprudence  it  is
      unlikely that the panel would have concluded as they did that it  was
      reasonable for the mother and child to follow the appellant to Sierra
      Leone, given their status  as  British  citizens  who  could  not  be
      expected to be required to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  or  European
      Union, this has no impact on the  overall  outcome  for  the  reasons
      given above. If deportation was  likely  to  lead  to  separation  of
      father and son, that separation was justified  and  proportionate  in
      the particular circumstances of this case, particularly in the  light
      of the factors discussed by the  panel  summarised  at  our  para  10
      above.

88.   Reliance in the skeleton argument upon the evidence of Ms. M  ignores
      the fact that the panel did not find Ms M credible  (para  408),  and
      said that her evidence was riddled with inconsistencies  (para  303).
      It gave adequate  reasons  for  reaching  these  findings,  when  the
      determination is read as a whole.

89.   We agree with Mr. Singh that reliance on Gul v Switzerland (1996)  22
      EHRR 93 does not help the appellant, given that  Gul  indicates  that
      there is a presumption of family life between a father and his  child
      and the panel  accepted  that  there  was  family  life  between  the
      appellant and S to that extent (para 322).

90.   In response to para 84 of the skeleton argument, the panel  correctly
      pointed out that it did not need to isolate every piece  of  evidence
      and explain what it made of every such piece. When read as  a  whole,
      the panel made adequate findings of fact and gave adequate reasons.

91.   Reliance in the skeleton argument upon Maslov v Austria  [2009]  INLR
      47 ECHR does not assist the appellant, given that it  is  plain  that
      the panel did consider and apply the guidance in  Maslov  (see  paras
      414 to 419).

92.   The remainder of ground 5 amounts to a disagreement with the  panel's
      findings, dressing up as assertions of errors of  law  by  the  panel
      arguments which are in reality mere disagreements.

93.   For all of the above reasons, we  have  concluded  that  the  panel's
      decision on the appeal did not involve the  making  of  any  material
      error on a point of law such that it falls to be set aside.

94.   Mr. Jacobs informed us that the appellant, Ms. M and S  are  now  all
      living together. This is post-hearing evidence, which we cannot  take
      into account absent any material error of law. In any event, the mere
      fact that the parties decided to  live  together  after  the  panel's
      determination was promulgated does not, of itself, mean that there is
      genuine family life between  the  appellant  and  Ms.  M,  given  the
      serious adverse assessment of credibility against both the  appellant
      and Ms. M and the threat of the deportation appeal hanging  over  the
      appellant's head.

      Conclusions:

      The making of decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

      The First-tier Tribunal  did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
      45(4)(i) of the Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
      2005.

      We do not make such an anonymity order.

                                 Appendix B

Chapter 12 - Enforcement Instructions and Guidance, last updated 25 January
     2010.


     "12. Section 3(5) (a) - Deportation on conducive grounds


     The Secretary of State  may  decide  that  a  person's  deportation  is
     conducive to the public good if (amongst other things):


     ?      he has been convicted of a serious offence or has a series of
          comparatively minor convictions and where the court did not
          recommend deportation;


     ?      he has obtained indefinite leave to remain by deception (but see
          also: Administrative Removal Procedures chapter 51)


     12.1. Deportation following a conviction
     There are many  reasons  why  a  Court  may  decide  not  to  recommend
     deportation under section 3(6), most commonly because its attention was
     not drawn to its powers in this respect or the judge decided  to  leave
     the matter to the Secretary of State. Consideration will  be  given  to
     deportation on conducive grounds if the person has one conviction for a
     serious crime or several convictions for  less  serious  crimes  which,
     taken together and weighed  against  any  compassionate  circumstances,
     merit deportation. The fact that a court has  decided  not  to  make  a
     recommendation does not debar the Secretary of State from  taking  such
     action himself but would be taken into account in consideration of  the
     case.


     12.2. Obtaining indefinite leave to remain by deception
     Where there is clear evidence  that  a  person  obtained,  prior  to  1
     October 1996, settlement by deception, refer to the  relevant  casework
     section. The standard of  proof  must  demonstrate  a  high  degree  of
     probability. See also:  Administrative  Removal  Procedures  for  cases
     where the deception was practised after 1 October 1996.


     12.3.1 Criminal Casework - Consideration for Non EEA Nationals
     Relevant considerations
     Where the criminal case deportation criteria is met the presumption  is
     that the person's continued presence in the UK is not conducive to  the
     public good. However it is still necessary  to  consider  the  offences
     committed (and previous convictions), the circumstances  of  them,  the
     judge's sentencing remarks and any other reports, and  decide,  in  the
     light of these, whether this presumption still stands.
     Relevant factors that must be taken into account include:-
     ?      Age: Where the person is aged under 18, is unaccompanied (or has
          family here with indefinite leave), and no adequate reception and
          accommodation  arrangements  exist  in  the  country  of   origin
          (through  the  presence  of  family  or   otherwise).   In   such
          circumstances deportation should normally be deferred  until  the
          person turns 18.


     ?      Length of residence  in  the  UK:  Where  the  person  has  been
          resident in the United Kingdom for 25 years or more (not counting
          periods in custody), unless he has been convicted  of  a  serious
          offence.
     ?      Strength of connections to the UK: Where the  person  has  spent
          the majority of their formative years (from 0-10  years  old)  in
          the UK and has been resident here since.


     ?      Links with country of origin: Where the person has no family  in
          their country of origin, doesn't speak the language, and has  not
          lived in that country for a significant period.


     ?      Domestic circumstances: Where the person  is  married  or  in  a
          civil partnership or has children (including children living with
          or  in  regular  contact  with  the   person)   and   there   are
          insurmountable obstacles to the family accompanying  them.  Refer
          to paragraph 6.2 of the API  on  Article  8  for  information  on
          insurmountable obstacles.


     The factors that must be considered here are not limited to what  would
     be relevant under the Human Rights Act. However  it  will  only  be  in
     exceptional circumstances that the public interest might be  outweighed
     by compassionate circumstances where the deportation  would  be  lawful
     under the Human Rights Act."

Unnumbered chapter between Chapter 14 and Chapter 15 of the Enforcement
Instructions and Guidance, last updated 25 January 2010.


     "Important changes to our deportation policy
     As of 1 August 2008,  we  will  now  consider  for  deportation  a  new
     category  of  foreign  national  offender.  From  this  date,   non-EEA
     nationals who are convicted in the UK and receive a custodial  sentence
     of any length for an offence relating to the supply of class A, B or  C
     drugs* will be considered for deportation. This is in addition to those
     already considered for deportation.
     Where the sentence imposed is 12 months or more,  the  duty  to  deport
     will remain under  the  automatic  deportation  provisions  of  the  UK
     Borders Act 2007. Where the provisions of the UK Borders  Act  2007  do
     not take effect, cases will be assessed under  the  provisions  of  the
     Immigration Act 1971.

-----------------------
      [1] Section 3(5) and (6):


            "(5)  A person who  is  not  a  British  citizen  is  liable  to
             deportation from the United Kingdom if -

                       conducive to the public good; or
                  (b)  another person to whose family he belongs is  or  has
                       been ordered to be deported.
               (6)     Without prejudice to the operation of subsection  (5)

             for which  he  is  punishable  with  imprisonment  and  on  his
             conviction is recommended for deportation by a court  empowered

[2]  Section 5(1):


            "(1)  Where a person is  under  3(5)  or  (6)  above  liable  to
             deportation, then subject to the following provisions  of  this
             Act the Secretary of State may make a deportation order against
             him, that is to  say  an  order  requiring  him  to  leave  and
             prohibiting  him  from  entering  the  United  Kingdom;  and  a
             deportation order against a person shall invalidate  any  leave
             to enter or remain in the United Kingdom given him  before  the
             order is made or while it is in force."


[3] It may be noted that under section 15(1) of the  1971  Act,  the  appeal
was against "a decision of the Secretary of  State  to  make  a  deportation
order against him by virtue of section 3(5) above".
