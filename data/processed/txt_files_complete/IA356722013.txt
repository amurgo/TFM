Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Hussain, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who appealed unsuccessfully to the
    First-tier Tribunal against a decision of the  respondent  refusing  her
    leave to remain as the wife of a  person  present  and  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the  appellant
    did meet the requirements of the Rules relating  to  competence  in  the
    English language but dismissed the appeal  because  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant could be maintained in accordance with  the
    Rules.

 2. It is important to appreciate that the Immigration  Rules  as  presently
    drafted are little to do with a person's actual ability  to  maintain  a
    person or to be maintained by them but  to  do  with  their  ability  to
    produce prescribed evidence in a particular way at a particular time.  I
    can only make sense of the rules by assuming that that  this  rough  and
    ready approach is sufficiently accurate to produce a  fair  result.   It
    clearly has the advantage of making applications easy to decide and,  in
    any event, the  rules  have  to  be  applied  regardless  of  whether  I
    understand them.

 3. It was an obligation on the appellant when she made her  application  to
    support it with various documents and she did not do that.  In fact  she
    could not do that because her husband had  not  been  working  for  long
    enough to have the necessary money.  He produced evidence  that  he  had
    worked in the two months preceding the application and in the second  of
    those months, according to the  evidence,  he  earned  quite  sufficient
    money to support the appellant in accordance with the Rules if that  sum
    had been earned in every month over the previous year but it had not.

 4. The issue identified in the permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    was whether the appellant had to produce a full  six  months'  worth  of
    documentation when it was everyone's  case  that  the  husband  had  not
    worked for six months and so could not possibly  produce  the  necessary
    documents.  In fact the Rules are a little more sophisticated  than  the
    grants of permission suggested and I have been shown  by  Mr  Hussain  a
    copy of Appendix FM-SE, in particular paragraph 13  headed  "Calculating
    gross annual income under Appendix FM".  This provides for proof of  the
    necessary funds in certain ways.  The easiest way is if the  person  can
    show sufficient money earned over the last six months immediately  prior
    to the application in the sense that the six months salary grossed up to
    an annual level would meet the requirements of the  Rules.   It  is  not
    challenged that this is not such a case.

 5. There is an alternative under 13(b) where a person has been employed for
    less than six months and in those circumstances  other  matters  can  be
    taken into account. In  particular  account  can  be  taken  of  private
    pensions, other forms of  private  income  (for  example  rental  income
    although this may not be covered by the Rules) and income from  previous
    employment.  A person will only be able to satisfy the  requirements  of
    the Rules based on less than six months' income when  they  have  earned
    sufficient money in a shorter period to  exceed  the  target  figure,  I
    think, of ï¿½18,600 in this case.

 6. It is common ground that this appellant cannot do that.

 7. It was Mr Atuegbe's case that this reading of the Rules  was  wrong  and
    that the shorter period of employment could be multiplied by 6 or 12  as
    the case may be to  indicate  the  gross  annual  income  based  on  the
    previous month's figure and that would have shown  sufficient  money  to
    meet  the  requirements  of  the   Rules.    This   is   an   attractive
    interpretation, wholly unsupported by anything in the Rules that I or Mr
    Hussain have been able to find.  Clearly something has planted the  idea
    there but we cannot ascertain anything that  supports  this  contention.
    It would be rather surprising if this  approach  was  right  because  it
    would mean that a person who contrived a job  just  for  the  one  month
    before the application would be in as good a position as  a  person  who
    had got a full six months' working history  behind  him,  and  it  seems
    unlikely that this is what the Rules intend to do.  Indeed, if that  was
    the policy of the Rules, one would see no point whatsoever in looking at
    six months at all, but any income grossed up would be sufficient.

 8. I therefore found Mr Atuegbe's arguments interesting  but  fundamentally
    misconceived and I have to I dismiss the appeal on that point.

 9. Human rights always have to be considered and  particularly  in  a  case
    where the parties are partners to a marriage but Mr Atuegbe did not feel
    able to advance the case on human rights grounds and I commend  him  for
    not wasting the Tribunal's time with points that would  most  charitably
    be described as extremely optimistic.  This is not a  case  where  there
    are, for example, minor children involved or where the decision could be
    expected to lead to the long term separation of a family.

10. It may well be that the appellant could now  make  an  application  that
    did meet the requirements of the Rules and that  is  something  she  may
    want to consider but it is not for me to advise her.

11. I am quite satisfied that the approach of the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    correct and that no material error of law has been identified before  me
    and I dismiss the appellant's appeal.
