Representation:

For the appellant:       Mr  D  Seddon  Counsel  instructed  by  Bindman  &
                   Partners.
For the respondent:     Mr D W Saville, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, Charley Ngom, is a citizen of Cameroon.  She was  born
      on 11 April 1987 and is therefore still a minor.

2.    With permission, she appeals the determination of an Adjudicator,  Mr
      A C  B  Markham  David,  promulgated  on  17 September  2003.    The
      appellant was granted leave to remain until 10 April  2005  which  is
      the day before her eighteenth birthday.   The  Adjudicator  was  only
      therefore concerned to decide whether the appellant was  entitled  to
      refugee status.  Although Mr Seddon  argued  before  the  Adjudicator
      that he should also deal with  the  question  of  human  rights,  the
      Adjudicator declined to do so and gave his reasons.    The  appellant
      has been refused permission to appeal on that issue.   The  grant  of
      permission was limited to questions arising  from  the  Adjudicator's
      apparent lack of reasons for finding that  it  would  not  be  unduly
      harsh to expect the appellant to return and relocate in  Yaound�  and
      the grounds assert that in making that assessment he failed  to  take
      her psychiatric condition into account.

3.    The Adjudicator's task, and ours, is to an extent an artificial  one.
      It is the question of determining refugee  status  when  it  is  well
      known that the appellant will not be returned for the time being.  It
      is slightly more difficult in this appeal than some. Not only is  the
      question of refugee status (the real risk on  return  of  persecution
      for a Convention reason) being decided on  the  theoretical  risk  of
      return now but also, if the respondent were to return  the  appellant
      now he would be in breach of  his  own  policies  on  the  return  of
      minors.   That policy is alluded to in the  reasons  for  refusal  of
      asylum which are set  out  in  a  letter  dated  7  April  2003.   In
      paragraph 7 of the  letter  the  respondent  indicates  that  he  has
      decided to exercise his discretion and grant limited leave to remain,



           "in accordance with the  published  Home  Office  asylum  policy
           instruction  on  discretionary  leave   because   you   are   an
           unaccompanied child for whom we are not satisfied that  adequate
           reception arrangements in your own country are available".

4.    It is not entirely clear how we should treat the respondent's  policy
      which means that, in the particular circumstances of this  appellant,
      she  would  not  be  returned  because  of  a   lack   of   reception
      arrangements, regardless of any actual risk.   For  the  purposes  of
      this determination we have decided that the policy should be  ignored
      because the grant of discretionary leave  is  not  relevant  and  the
      policy was at least part of the reason for that grant.

5.    The Adjudicator found that the appellant came  from  a  village  near
      Bamenda, three hours by bus from the capital, Yaound�.  She had  been
      living there with her  father,  an  older  brother  and  two  younger
      sisters.  Her mother had died in childbirth in 1990.   She  had  left
      school in September 2001 because her  father  was  an  alcoholic  and
      unable to pay the fees.   The main problem which  the  appellant  had
      was caused by her father and his  alcoholism.    In  January  2003  a
      police inspector had been killed in the area and it was said that the
      appellant's father was the killer.   Apparently  he  and  the  police
      inspector shared a  girlfriend.   The  appellant  is  unable  to  say
      whether there is any truth in the allegation or not.

6.    In early January 2003 the whole family was arrested and taken to  the
      police station.  The appellant's father was interrogated in front  of
      them and beaten.  This happened on more than one  occasion.   Neither
      the appellant nor her siblings were asked any questions  at  all  but
      whilst at the police station some of the male officers undressed  her
      and indicated they wanted to have  sex  with  her.  When  her  father
      objected he was beaten again.   However, she  was  not  subjected  to
      rape and there was no further sexual assault.  She was not beaten  or
      otherwise molested at all.   A  woman  called  Rachel,  who  was  her
      father's girlfriend, collected the appellant and  her  siblings  from
      the police station and initially took them back to  their  own  home.
      Some two days later the appellant's brother became ill after  playing
      football and died  the  following  morning.   Rachel  then  took  the
      appellant and her two sisters to her own house in a  nearby  village.
      The appellant said that she has no relatives on her mother's side  in
      Cameroon as her mother was Congolese.   Her father has some relatives
      in Yaound� but that is a long way from the village.    The  appellant
      told the Adjudicator that before her brother died, he  told  her  the
      police inspector's family intended to take revenge on  their  family.
      He warned the appellant and her sisters not to go out.

7.    After a short time Rachel said that  the  problem  was  getting  very
      serious and she was going to send the appellant to her sister's.  She
      brought the appellant to England and then abandoned her  in  a  shop.
      The appellant eventually ended up being taken to a police station  at
      Croydon.   Apparently Rachel  had  said  that  she  would  bring  the
      appellant to England first and her sisters later.

8.     The  Adjudicator  found  that  there  was  no  suggestion  that  the
      appellant's family was expected to return to the  police  station  at
      any time; that her father was in custody and although  there  was  no
      question of releasing him there was  no  evidence  any  intention  to
      punish the appellant or her siblings.  He was  satisfied  that  there
      was no reasonable likelihood of the appellant suffering  any  further
      persecution at the hands of the authorities in Cameroon.

9.    In dealing with her fear of the inspector's family,  the  Adjudicator
      accepted that  the  fear  was  genuine.   He  said  it  was  somewhat
      complicated because the appellant's fear, at least  to  some  extent,
      was a fear of being harmed by witchcraft.  The  Adjudicator  had  the
      benefit of an expert witness who said that it was likely that, in her
      home area, the family of the deceased police  officer  would  try  to
      take some form of action against her by way of revenge or to  assuage
      the wrath of their ancestors:  The Adjudicator found that in her home
      area,  if  this  were  to  occur,  there  would  be  no  satisfactory
      protection available from  the  authorities.   He  then  went  on  to
      consider the question of relocation.  He found that  the  appellant's
      sisters are both living in Yaound� with an aunt on her father's side.
       He said there was no evidence to suggest they  were  in  any  danger
      from the inspector's family in Bamenda, whilst they were  in  Yaound�
      nor that the appellant would be in any such danger.  He recorded that
      Mr Seddon had submitted to him that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
      expect the appellant to relocate there.  He relied on the letter sent
      to the appellant by her sisters in which they  complained  they  were
      not given enough to eat, they could get no medical treatment and they
      do all the work in the house and get scolded and told off a lot.   He
      also noted that the appellant had spoken to her aunt  in  June  2003.
      He also found that in addition to the aunt  in  Yaound�,  it  appears
      there are some of her father's cousins there. He went on to say,  "In
      these circumstances, I do not think it will be unreasonable,  in  the
      sense of unduly harsh, to expect the  appellant  to  relocate  there.
      Thus she is not entitled to refugee status."

10.   The factors which Mr Seddon argued make it unduly harsh to return the
      appellant are first,  the  psychological  problems  which  he  argued
      relate back to her persecution and are therefore not  independent  of
      it.   Second, he argued that there was  no  evidence  to  demonstrate
      that  the  internal  relocation  alternative  is  accessible  to  the
      appellant because she does not know where her aunt  and  her  sisters
      are, if they are still there.  He also  argued  that  the  respondent
      accepts there are no reception facilities and that she was and  is  a
      minor.

11.   As to the  relatives  in  Yaound�  the  only  evidence  is  that  the
      appellant has received a letter from her sisters and  that  they  are
      living with an aunt.   The appellant is said to  have  more  recently
      tried to telephone her aunt by ringing a telephone in the market  but
      her aunt has not been around.   There is no evidence to suggest  that
      the appellant's relatives are not in Yaound� or that her sisters  are
      not being cared for there.  The letter, which has no address  on  it,
      is short and says:-

           "Charley, it is with the greatest difficulty and suffering  that
           we make known to you our pain.  We are  suffering  much  because
           the woman has left.  It is even difficult finding enough to eat,
           and sometimes we go for two days before being  given  just  some
           cassava we have to do all the work in the house.   When  we  are
           ill, there is no medical treatment and that illnesses just  have
           to go away on their own.  We get scolded and  told  off  a  lot.
           How are you?  If you can,  please  come  and  get  us.   We  are
           suffering so much.  We have got much thinner.  If you see us you
           will cry.  We think a lot about you.  Yours sisters,  Belle  and
           Lyse: here are the photos of your aunt. Thank you."

12.   Although there is, in the bundle, a photocopy of  the  front  of  the
      envelope, addressed to the appellant's solicitor in the bundle  there
      is no copy of the back and so it is not known whether it has a return
      address on it.

13.   As to the  psychiatric  report,  Mr  Seddon  accepted  that  fear  of
      witchcraft is  not  an  objectively  well-founded  fear  although  he
      argued, and we are  prepared  to  accept,  that  it  may  well  be  a
      complicating factor in the  general  assessment  of  the  appellant's
      subjective fears and the psychiatric  problems  that  she  has  as  a
      result.  There has  been  a  recent  assessment  of  the  appellant's
      psychiatric condition by Dr L D Bell. His report  is  dated  15  June
      2004.   The report records that there has been  some  improvement  in
      the appellant's functioning since Dr Bell previously saw her in  July
      2003 although he said it was  clear  she  was  still  psychiatrically
      unwell.   He says that she told him that  she  deteriorated  recently
      and he believed that the prospect of a further interview with him may
      well have been a factor in that  deterioration.   His  conclusion  is
      that the appellant's improvement largely arises  from  a  feeling  of
      safety resulting from her living in  the  United  Kingdom  where  she
      feels less vulnerable but, the continued threat of return is  one  of
      the causes of her condition and any return "would result in  a  rapid
      deterioration of her mental state".   He went on to say that  he  did
      not believe the appellant would be able to avail herself of such help
      as she received in the United Kingdom, in Cameroon.  It is said  that
      the psychological support she derives from  attending  college  helps
      with her condition and that medication has a  very  limited  role  to
      play in the treatment of her condition as it  would  not  be  helpful
      until the main factors, the threat of return  and  her  psychological
      insecurity, are no longer active.

14.   The report is, as is the case of many psychiatric  reports  unhelpful
      in that it does not quantify the deterioration which may occur in the
      appellant if she were to return, nor  does  it  give  any  source  of
      knowledge as to the assertion that help and assistance would  not  be
      available in the Cameroon.

15.   It was not  seriously  argued  that  even  if  the  contents  of  the
      psychiatric report, and the question  of  becoming  a  street  child,
      which is discussed in the expert report at page 102  in  the  bundle,
      are relevant factors to take into account in  the  assessment  of  an
      asylum claim, that the appellant would be entitled to refugee  status
      on the basis of them alone.

16.   The question we had to grapple with, given that the appellant had not
      challenged the finding that she would be able to avoid the  objective
      risk from the inspector's family by relocating to Yaound�, is whether
      the combination of her  age,  the  possible  inability  to  find  her
      siblings and relations, the  question  of  street  children  and  the
      psychiatric evidence, together make it such  that  it  will  make  it
      unduly harsh for her to relocate to Yaound�.  Mr Saville argued that
      these factors may well be persuasive in the course of an  application
      for further leave to remain on human rights grounds,  but  they  were
      not such as to mean that she must be granted refugee status.

17.   The current leading authority, which we were told is the  subject  of
      an appeal to the House of Lords is that of AE and FE  [2003]  Imm  AR
      609 or [2003] EWCA Civ 1032.   Mr Seddon argued that we should prefer
      the decision in Robinson [1997] Imm AR 568.  We do  not  agree.    AE
      and FE was decided by a Court including the Master of the  Rolls.  It
      explained at some length the nature of the correct  factors  to  take
      into account when considering the question of undue harshness and why
      the Court's views had changed.  At paragraph 66  Lord  Phillips  said
      that there  had  been  material  developments  since  Robinson  (also
      decided by a Court including  the  then  Master  of  the  Rolls),  he
      referred to the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  having  come  into  effect
      requiring decision makers to take  into  consideration  human  rights
      issues when  considering  the  question  of  the  removal  of  asylum
      seekers.  In addition, the numbers claiming asylum had risen.

18.   In AE and FE the court considered whether, where  a  husband  had  an
      internal  relocation  alternative  to  Colombo,  from  Jaffna,   that
      alternative was made unduly harsh  by  his  wife's  mental  condition
      which could not be treated in Colombo.   Here it is the  same  person
      who has the fear of persecution elsewhere and  a  medical  condition.
      We do not regard that distinction as being of  relevance  because  of
      the courts overall approach to this question.  We say that because in
      paragraph 70 of AE and FE the court said:-

           "On  the  facts,  the  wife's  psychiatric  condition   is   not
           attributable   to   persecution,   or   well-founded   fear   of
           persecution, on her part nor  related  to  her  husband's  well-
           founded fear of persecution in  Jaffna.   When  considering  the
           question of whether it will be reasonable to expect the  husband
           to live in Colombo rather than Jaffna, his wife's condition is a
           neutral  factor.   It  does  not  make   Colombo   unviable   or
           unreasonable as a safe haven.  There may be good  grounds  under
           the Human Rights Act, or as a matter of common humanity for  not
           sending this family back to Colombo.  The reason why  AE  wishes
           to remain in this country is not that there is nowhere where  he
           can reasonably be expected to live in Sri Lanka  that  will  not
           expose him to a well-founded fear of persecution.  In essence it
           is if he and his wife are permitted to remain  in  this  country
           this is likely to be beneficial to  her  post  traumatic  stress
           disorder,  where  a  return  to  Sri  Lanka  is  likely  to   be
           detrimental to this.  This is not a reason to find that  he  has
           refugee  status  under  the  Convention  his  appeal   must   be
           dismissed."


19.   It is true to say that  in  this  case  the  appellant's  psychiatric
      condition is attributable to her experiences in Cameroon, but not  in
      Yaound�.

20.   However, earlier in the judgment the Master of  the  Rolls  said,  at
      paragraph 64:-

           "... So far as refugee status is concerned, a comparison must be
           made between the asylum seeker's conditions and circumstances in
           the place where he has reason to fear persecution and those that
           he would be faced  with  in  the  suggested  place  of  internal
           relocation.   If  that  comparison  suggests  that  it  will  be
           unreasonable or unduly harsh to expect him to relocate in  order
           to  escape  the  risk  of  persecution  his  refugee  status  is
           established.  The 'unduly  harsh'  test  has  been  extended  in
           practice to have regard to factors which  are  not  relevant  to
           refugee  status,  but  which  are  very  relevant   to   whether
           exceptional leave should  be  granted  having  regard  to  human
           rights .... humanitarian considerations."


      The court then went on to say that:-


      "65.  The problem  with  this  is  that  humanitarian  considerations
           cannot readily be applied as a test of  law  as  to  whether  an
           individual  is  entitled  to  refugee  status.   What   is   the
           touchstone which marks the difference between what is harsh  and
           what is unduly harsh?"


21.   The court went on to quote from the Tribunal  determination  in  that
      appeal.     Having considered the Tribunal's  earlier  determination,
      and set out the changes that had occurred since Robinson,  the  court
      went on to say:-

      "67.  It seems to us  important  that  consideration  of  immigration
           applications and appeals should distinguish clearly between,  i)
           the right to refugee status and the Refugee Convention; ii)  the
           right to remain by reason  by  rights  under  the  Human  Rights
           Convention; and iii) considerations which might be relevant to a
           grant of leave to remain for humanitarian reasons.   So  far  as
           the first is concerned the consideration  of  reasonableness  of
           internal relocation should focus  on  the  consequences  to  the
           asylum seeker of settling in the place of relocation instead  of
           his previous home.  The comparison between  the  asylum  seekers
           situation in this country and what it will be in  the  place  of
           relocation is not relevant for this purpose.   It  may  be  very
           relevant when consideration of the Human Rights  Convention,  or
           the requirements of humanity.


22.   That seems to us to cover the position here.   We  cannot  find  when
      comparing conditions in Yaound� with those which the appellant  might
      find if he were to return to her home area it would be  unduly  harsh
      to return her to Yaound�.  She has no objective reason  to  fear  the
      inspector's family there. Her subjective fear of witchcraft would  be
      no worse in Yaound� than it is in her home area.  She has  family  in
      Yaound� which she does not have in her home area.  We agree  with  Mr
      Saville that, however powerful the arguments about not returning  the
      appellant may be in relation to her age, difficulty  in  finding  her
      relatives and mental health are, they are not appropriate factors  to
      take into account when considering refugee status.

23.   We should mention the case Ikhoq [1997] Imm AR 404, relied on  by  Mr
      Seddon.  We did not find that a  helpful  authority.    We  say  that
      because although the Court of  Appeal  were  prepared  to  take  into
      account the medical condition when looking at the question  of  undue
      harshness (in 1997), the question of whether or not they should do so
      was not an issue in the appeal. It was accepted by all concerned that
      it was appropriate to do so.

24.   In dismissing this appeal we make it clear that we were only  dealing
      with the question of refugee status and that the  appellant  has  the
      protection she needs by  the  grant  of  leave.  She  will  have  the
      opportunity of making an application for variation to extend that  in
      due course.   We are not therefore saying that she can or  cannot  be
      safely returned. We are only saying  that  she  is  not  entitled  to
      refugee  status.   There  was  no  material  error  of  law  in   the
      Adjudicator's determination.

25.   The respondent granted leave because of his policy on the  return  of
      minors without  knowing  whether  there  are  satisfactory  reception
      arrangements.  There is nothing to indicate the he has made  specific
      enquiries  about  the  appellant,  as  opposed  to   having   general
      arrangements in place. The  evidence  is  that  there  is  family  in
      Yaound� and the appellant is not reasonably likely to be left to fend
      for herself.  Even if we were wrong about this, it does  not  matter.
      The problems that the policy is intended to cover  are  human  rights
      issues and, following AE and FE, not appropriate to take into account
      when assessing undue harshness in an asylum context.


26.   The appeal is dismissed.
