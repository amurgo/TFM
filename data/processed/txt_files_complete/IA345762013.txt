                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondent

 1. The Respondent to whom I shall refer as the Applicant is a  citizen  of
    Nigeria, born on 28 December 1965.  On 6 July  2005  she  arrived  with
    leave as a short-term student.   Her  student  leave  was  extended  on
    several occasions and finally expired on  17 September  2012.   On  10
    September 2012, in time, the Applicant applied  for  further  leave  to
    remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  Points-Based
    System.

 2. On 12 August 2013 the Appellant (the SSHD) refused the  application  on
    the basis that the Applicant did not meet the requirements of paragraph
    245DD(b) and  Appendix  A  (Attributes).   She  had  not  provided  the
    evidence  specified  under  paragraph  41-SD  of  Appendix  A  of   the
    Immigration Rules to show she had access to the requisite  funds.   The
    SSHD also found she had not shown she had sufficient  disposable  funds
    under Appendix A.  The Respondent proposed  to  make  directions  under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 for  her
    removal to Nigeria.

The First-tier Tribunal's Determination

 3. By a determination promulgated on 26 September 2014 Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Griffith  dismissed  the  Applicant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and allowed it on human  rights  grounds  by  way  of
    reference to Article 8 of the European Convention.

 4. The Judge found the Applicant had not been properly advised  about  the
    requirements  of  paragraph  41-SD  of  the  Rules  and  although   the
    documentation she had submitted did not comply with the Rules there was
    nevertheless clear evidence subsequent  to  the  application  that  the
    Applicant had access to some �200,000.   In  addition  the  Applicant's
    signature was missing from the declaration contained in a letter of  15
    August 2012 and there was no letter from her solicitors confirming  the
    validity of the signatures.  The firm was no longer in  a  position  to
    rectify the omission since it had become the subject of an intervention
    by the Law Society.

 5. The Judge noted the Applicant who  was  unrepresented  at  the  hearing
    before her did not pursue a claim  under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention although I see reference was made to it in  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal lodged under Section 82 of the 2002 Act.  However the Judge went
    on to consider the claim on the basis that she had  to  decide  whether
    the decision under appeal amounted to a breach of the Applicant's right
    to a private life protected by Article 8 of the European Convention.

 6. The Judge noted the Applicant could not  satisfy  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules and she still had ties to her
    home country.  Her father still lived there and sent her  an  allowance
    and her proposed business was for the distribution or sale of  Nigerian
    foods.  There was no evidence before the Judge of any  family  life  in
    the United Kingdom.

 7. At paragraph 30 the Judge noted the  Applicant  had  previously  always
    complied with the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules;  that  she
    evidently had capital at her disposal and that she  had  already  spent
    money to take a lease of premises from which she  intended  to  conduct
    her business.  Accordingly, the Judge found there were no  reasons  why
    the public interest would be disproportionately  disadvantaged  if  the
    Applicant were permitted to remain in the United Kingdom to pursue  her
    commercial activities.

 8. Mr Avery relied on the Grounds for Appeal.  He referred  to  Patel  and
    Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72in which it was held that Article 8 of  the
    European Convention was  not  to  be  used  as  a  general  ground  for
    dispensing with compliance with the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Judge's
    treatment of Article 8 in her determination, even though the  Applicant
    did not pursue it, was in error and  that  part  of  the  determination
    should be set aside.  He invited me to  proceed  with  the  substantive
    appeal and dismiss it for the same reasons.

Error of Law Consideration

 9. The Judge properly referred to the judgment in R (oao  Razgar)  v  SSHD
    [2004] UKHL 27 and set out the questions which she needed  to  address.
    In assessing  the proportionality of the SSHD's decision the Judge  did
    not identify the legitimate public objective  referred  to  in  Article
    8(2) by which she went on to  assess  whether  the  SSHD  decision  was
    disproportionate to the public interest.  She gave weight at  paragraph
    30 of her determination to the facts the Applicant  had  complied  with
    the Immigration Rules since her arrival  in  2005  and  that  fees  for
    education had been paid.  This does not take into account what was said
    in Nasim and Others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 that a person's human
    rights are not enhanced by not  committing  criminal  offences  or  not
    relying on public funds.

10. The Judge at paragraph 27 considered that the  Applicant  had  probably
    been not been well served by her solicitors and that  such  advice  had
    led to her failing to meet all  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules in relation to the evidence and documents required to support her
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant application.  The Judge went  on  to  say
    the case did not amount to a "near-miss".  The fact the  Applicant  did
    not lodge the requisite documentation with her application but  if  she
    had she would have met the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  does
    amount to a "near-miss".  Whether the failure was  due  to  poor  legal
    advice or for some other reason does not change the position  that  the
    failure was not other than a near-miss although it may explain how  the
    near-miss came about.

11. The Judge addressed the nature of the public interest as  explained  in
    Section 117B of the 2002 Act  perfunctorily  at  paragraph  31  of  her
    determination.  The Judge had found the Applicant was dependent on  her
    brother and her father.  There was no reference to any business plan or
    a finding that the Applicant  would  be  financially  independent:  see
    Section 117B(3).  Other than the fact the Applicant had  been  studying
    for a very considerable period of time,  and  intended  to  set  up  in
    business, there was no evidence or reference to the Applicant's private
    and family life in the United Kingdom. The Judge erred  in  not  taking
    these matters into account. For these reasons the determination of  the
    First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law such that  it  should  be
    set aside.

12. Notice of the hearing to the Applicant also gave notice that if she  or
    her representative did not attend her appeal might be determined in her
    absence.  I was satisfied that the Applicant had  been  given  adequate
    opportunity to appear before the Upper Tribunal to present her case.

13. The documentary evidence before the First-tier Tribunal and  the  Upper
    Tribunal was limited.  There were various bank statements  relating  to
    the funds of �200,000 and their whereabouts, evidence of  incorporation
    of a company and bank statements for the company, as well  as  evidence
    of the company's acquisition  of  leasehold  premises.   There  was  no
    evidence to show the Applicant's role or  investment  in  the  company.
    There was no evidence other  than  that  already  referred  to  of  her
    private and family life in the United Kingdom.

The Standard and Burden of Proof

14. The standard of proof is the civil standard, that is on the balance  of
    probabilities.  The burden is on the Applicant.  The part of the appeal
    being considered relates only  to  a  claim  under  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention outside the Immigration Rules  so  account  may  be
    taken of evidence of matters subsequent to  the  date  of  decision  or
    which is produced subsequent to the date  of  the  initial  application
    leading to the decision under appeal.  Evidence of  matters  subsequent
    to the date of decision  may  be  taken  into  account.   There  is  no
    material evidence submitted at any time other than that to which I have
    already referred.

Disposal

15. Keeping in mind the judgment in R (oao Oludoyi) v SSHD IJR [2014]  UKUT
    00539 (IAC) I adopt the approach to appeals on grounds of Article 8  in
    accordance with the jurisprudence which comes from Strasbourg and  from
    Huang and subsequent judgments which were summarised at paragraphs 7-12
    of EB (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41.  I accept that by reason  of  the
    Applicant's presence in the United Kingdom since  2005  she  will  have
    established a private life.  There was no evidence of any family  life,
    despite references to a brother.  The removal of  the  Applicant  would
    amount to an interference with her private life but given that she  has
    failed to meet the requisite requirements of the Points-Based System in
    the Immigration Rules and there was limited, if any,  evidence  of  any
    other private life in the United  Kingdom,  I  do  not  find  that  the
    interference would be of such gravity as to engage the United Kingdom's
    obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention.   Consequently,
    the claim under Article 8 must fail.

Anonymity

16. There was no request for an anonymity order  or  direction  and  having
    considered the documents in the Tribunal file and decided the appeal  I
    find that none is warranted.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law
    in its treatment of the  Applicant's  claim  under  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention outside the Immigration Rules such that  that  part
    of it is set aside.  The following decision is substituted:

    The appeal of the  Applicant  is  dismissed  on  human  rights  grounds
    (Article 8).

    The appeal to the Upper Tribunal of the SSHD is allowed.
