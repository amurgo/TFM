                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Chowdhury instructed by Masud & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the respondent but
    nonetheless I shall refer to the parties as they were described  before
    the First-tier Tribunal that is Mr Abdur Rahman as  the  appellant  and
    the Secretary of State as the Respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 7th October  1976  and
    he made an application on 26th  May  2013  for  entry  clearance  as  a
    visitor under paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.  This  application
    was refused by the respondent on 23rd June 2013.  The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that the appellant was a genuine visitor  who
    intended to leave the UK at the end of the visit, was able to  maintain
    and accommodate himself adequately or could meet the onward cost of his
    return journey contrary to  paragraphs  41(i),  (ii),  (vi)  and  (vii)
    (accommodation).   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  noted  that  he  had
    produced a letter from a clinical nurse  specialist  at  Guy's  and  St
    Thomas' Hospital (NHS) which related to his wish  to  become  a  kidney
    donor for Delwar Hussain (the  donee).   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    noted that the right of appeal was limited to the grounds  referred  to
    in Section 84(1)(c) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act.

 3. Given the seriousness of the reason for  the  trip  the  appellant  was
    requested to submit evidence to corroborate  his  friendship  with  the
    sponsor and a reply was  received  from  the  sponsor's  cousin  Nazmul
    Hussain Uddin in which he stated no evidence was available owing to him
    being a religious person.  He had failed to satisfy the Entry Clearance
    Officer that a relationship was sufficiently close for him to travel to
    the UK for the purpose to be credible.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer also assessed the appellant's own  personal
    financial circumstances in Bangladesh.  The appellant was  employed  as
    an assistant teacher earning a salary of BDT 15,000, that is  �121  per
    month.  His bank statement for his personal  account  with  the  Islami
    Bank showed a history from 3rd October 2011 to 12th May  2013  and  the
    balance had been boosted by a contribution  of  BDT  130,000  from  his
    financial sponsor in the UK, approximately �1,050.  However the account
    statement without this large deposit did not show a balance higher than
    �69 (BDT 8532) throughout the account history.  In view of  the  modest
    salary and low personal savings,  the Entry Clearance Officer  was  not
    satisfied that he had reason or intended to leave the UK at the end  of
    his trip.  Also the Entry Clearance Officer had not  seen  evidence  of
    any tests being carried out and this  lack  of  preparation  given  the
    amount of money to be spent on the trip and the risk that he may not be
    suitable for donation adds to the doubt.

 5. The sponsor stated he had sent �1,100 to pay for the travel  and  other
    expenses and he was a friend of the donee.  There was no evidence  that
    this expenditure was  commensurate  with  his  own  personal  financial
    circumstances.

 6. On 14th April 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Colvin allowed the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules stating that she had  had  the  benefit  of
    oral evidence from the financial sponsor Mr  Uddin  and  there  was  no
    reason to doubt the credibility of his evidence.  He  stated  that  the
    relationship between himself and the donee was as first cousin and  the
    appellant was that of a close family friend as well as being  distantly
    related.   The  donee  and  the  appellant  appeared  to  have  met  in
    Bangladesh through Mr Uddin in 2006 and remained in contact.  The judge
    was satisfied from the evidence that she received that the "motive is a
    genuine wish to help a friend and a relative" [12].  He had  undertaken
    the preliminary tests and been informed by Mr Hussain's NHS  consultant
    that he was a suitable match subject to further tests.  [12].

 7. The judge found "it is clear that Mr Hussain who is already on dialysis
    will be given the best opportunity as a young man  if  he  has  a  live
    donor transplant as soon as possible" [12].

 8. The judge went on to find at [13]

         "In all these circumstances and on the  evidence  before  me  I  am
         fully satisfied that the appellant is a genuine visitor who intends
         to leave the UK after the visit to be  a  transplant  donor  to  Mr
         Hussain.  Accordingly I allow the appeal and I am satisfied that he
         fulfils the requirements of paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules."

 9. The judge added,

         "In addition I consider that there is a  substantive  human  rights
         issue in this case that relates to Mr Hussain."

Application for Permission to Appeal

10. The respondent stated that the decision to refuse entry  clearance  did
    not attract a full right of appeal  and  was  limited  to  the  grounds
    referred to in Section 84(1)(b) and (c) of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act and in particular, "that the decision is unlawful  under
    Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (42) (public  authority  not  to
    act contrary to Human Rights Convention) as being incompatible with the
    appellant's Convention rights."

11. In considering the appeal and allowing the appeal under the Immigration
    Rules the  judge  failed  to  engage  with  the  provisions  under  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act.

12. She did not make findings in relation to human rights or race relations
    and the determination did not record that either of these grounds  were
    advanced.  As such there was no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

13. Permission to appeal was granted as  the  appellant  was  intending  to
    visit a friend his rights were limited.

The Hearing

14. Mr Bramble relied on the  grounds  contained  in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal and Mr Chowdhury conceded that the matter had been
    decided on the Immigration Rules alone and not in relation to the human
    rights grounds raised in the notice of appeal by the appellant.

15.  Mr  Chowdhury  produced  further  papers  in  relation  to  the  tests
    undertaken by the appellant, Mr Abdur Rahman, some of which were  dated
    5th January 2013.

16. I pointed out that the tests undertaken on 5th January 2013 were  taken
    by someone with a different date of birth.

17. Mr Uddin the financial sponsor attended and  gave  oral  testimony  and
    confirmed that he was a reprographic operator on �20,000 a year, he had
    a five bedroomed house for which he paid the mortgage of �398 per month
    and he had a take-home pay of �1,400 to �1,500 per month but he had  no
    evidence to confirm this.

18. He also confirmed that his father contributed to the  household  income
    as a cab driver.  He last met the appellant in 2006 which is  when  the
    sponsor and potential donee also met the appellant.

19. Mr Bramble submitted that one of the concerns of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager  was  the  evidence  provided  by  the  hospital  but   further
    information had now been  provided  albeit  that  one  of  the  letters
    recorded a different date of birth for the appellant.

20. Mr Chowdhury submitted that there  was  a  serious  issue  of  a  life-
    threatening disease for the sponsor  and  that  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed.  All the tests had been undertaken.

Conclusions

21. It is clear that Judge Colvin erred legally  in  her  approach  to  the
    appeal by allowing the appeal under paragraph  41  of  the  Immigration
    Rules albeit that the right of appeal is restricted such that the  only
    appealable grounds were those referred to in Section 84(1)(b)  and  (c)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 following a  change
    in the Immigration Rules on 9th July 2012.  I accept that the appellant
    did appeal further to Article 8.

22. I was invited to preserve the findings at paragraphs 12 and 13  in  the
    determination of Judge Colvin.

23. I declined to preserve those findings on the following basis.   Further
    evidence  was  provided  in  relation  to  the  appellant  from  Labaid
    Diagnostics Centre dated 5th January 2013.   Those  tests  identify  an
    incorrect date of birth of the appellant that being 5th  January  1977.
    He gave his date of birth as the 7th October  1976.  The  evidence  put
    forward was that the sponsor who is hopeful of a kidney transplant  was
    to receive a kidney from the appellant.

24. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the application  on  the  basis  he
    found it reasonable to expect that the appellant would  have  undergone
    initial medical tests to assess the suitability  to  act  as  an  organ
    donor.  From the supporting documents the Entry Clearance  Officer  was
    not satisfied that any tests have been carried out.  The tests supplied
    to me referred to an incorrect date of birth for the appellant and I am
    not persuaded therefore that the tests are accurate or that it was even
    the appellant who presented himself for testing.  This  undermines  the
    genuine nature of the application.  In addition although the  financial
    sponsor Mr Nazmul Hussain Uddin attended  the  hearing  as  the  cousin
    brother of the sponsor in the UK he had not seen  the  appellant  since
    2006 and indeed confirmed that the sponsor and donee had not  seen  the
    appellant since 2006.  This does not satisfy me that the appellant  and
    donee are close and sufficiently close in order  that  it  is  credible
    that they have a genuine relationship such  that  the  appellant  would
    wish to donate a kidney.

25. It is quite clear that the appellant is on very limited means and has a
    family in Bangladesh which constitutes his  wife  and  child  which  he
    would have to leave for a  period  of  up  to  six  months.  The  visit
    according to the sponsorship declaration of Mr Nazmul Uddin would be on
    a "short-term basis."  And I am not persuaded on the limited income  of
    the appellant and the lack of any documentary evidence to  confirm  his
    financial position that he would have the savings  to  accommodate  and
    maintain the appellant whilst he was in  the  UK,  particularly  as  it
    would appear that it would be any time up to six months.

26. I asked the financial sponsor who claimed to  be  close  to  the  donee
    whether any other efforts had been made to find  an  alternative  donor
    and he stated that he did not know.  If the financial sponsor had  been
    close to the donee as he claims I see no reason why he should not  know
    this  information  and  thus  that  the  information  he  supplied  was
    reliable.

27. I can envisage no protected right under the European Convention for the
    appellant to be able to donate  a  kidney  to  someone  he  has  little
    contact with.  They are not related.  I can accept  that  the  physical
    integrity of the donee is an issue but he gave very little  information
    about himself and although the donee  may  have  a  requirement  for  a
    kidney, I am not persuaded as to the genuineness  of  the  relationship
    between the appellant's sponsor and donee or accept and because of  the
    difficulties with the medical evidence (ie  that  they  are  accurate),
    that the appellant is in fact a  potential  donor.  The  Guy's  and  St
    Thomas' documentation, in particular the letter of 25th February  2013,
    confirming the suitability of the appellant as a donor, is based on the
    Lab Aid Ltd medical tests.  The tests were conducted on between 3rd and
    5th January 2013 and as I state gave the wrong date of birth.  This  in
    turn  undermines  the  credibility  of  the  tests  and  in  turn   the
    credibility of the human rights claim. The donee is currently receiving
    medical treatment at Guy's and St  Thomas'  Hospital  on  the  national
    health service.

28. I therefore remake the decision and refuse the appeal.

Order

29. The appeal of Mr Abdur Rahman against the ECO refusal is dismissed.
