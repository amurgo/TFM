                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals from the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Samina Iqbal sitting at  Hatton  Cross  on  28  September  2016)
    dismissing his appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State
    made on 16 October 2015 to refuse to  grant  him  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on the grounds of long residence.  The First-tier  Tribunal  did
    not make an anonymity  direction,  and  I  do  not  consider  that  the
    appellant  requires  anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 3 April 2017 First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett gave his reasons for
    granting the  appellant  permission  to  appeal.   He  noted  that  the
    appellant had also appealed against the decision to  remove  him  under
    the EEA Regulations (this was  in  appeal  number  IA/33868/2015).   It
    appeared that a confusion in the listing of the appeals might have  led
    to the appellant being unaware of the hearing on 28  September  2016  -
    leading to the application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  It was arguable  that  there  was  an  error  in  the  Judge
    proceeding in the appellant's absence at  the  hearing,  "resulting  in
    unfairness".

Relevant Background Facts

 3. The appellant is a national of Uzbekistan, whose date of  birth  is  25
    July 1975.  He entered the United Kingdom on 13 May 2004,  and  he  has
    lived here ever since.  Until  29  February  2012,  the  appellant  had
    continuous leave under the Rules, apart from a period of  approximately
    129 days when he was without valid leave from 30 September  2007  until
    his next grant of leave to remain  on  7  February  2008.   Before  the
    expiry of his last grant of leave to remain, he applied on  23  January
    2012 for a residence card under the EEA  Regulations.   He  was  issued
    with an EEA residence card, valid from 22 June 2012 to 22 June 2017.

The Application for ILR in December 2014

 4. On 1 December 2014, Khans Solicitors applied on the appellant's  behalf
    for him to be granted ILR on the grounds of 10 years' continuous lawful
    residence in the United Kingdom.  They acknowledged that there had been
    a break in the appellant's lawful residence in the period 2007 to 2008,
    but they submitted that  this  was  due  to  circumstances  beyond  the
    appellant's control, as his sponsor had withdrawn her  sponsorship  due
    to the fact that she was moving to Scotland.   So  the  respondent  was
    invited to exercise discretion in accordance with her published  policy
    set out in "Guidance Long Residence - version 2.0"  dated 28 May 2012.

 5. With regard to the appellant's period of residence  since  29  February
    2012, they acknowledged that, under the Home Office's policy  guidance,
    the time spent as a family member of an  EEA  national  did  not  count
    towards 10 years' lawful residence.  However, the same  policy  enabled
    case workers to consider exercising discretion to count such time spent
    in the UK as lawful residence, if the applicant  meets  all  the  other
    requirements for long residence.

The enforcement visit on 7 June 2015

 6. While the application was pending, there was an enforcement visit on  7
    June 2015 at the address where the appellant had said he  resided  with
    his EEA national spouse.  According to a witness statement made by  the
    appellant on 3 May 2017, the outcome of  this  enforcement  visit  was,
    firstly, that his residence card was revoked on the  same  day  (as  to
    which there is no documentary evidence) and, secondly, he was served on
    the same day with an IS15A notice informing him  of  his  liability  to
    removal under the EEA Regulations  2006.   The  notice  said  that  his
    removal was justified on the grounds of abuse of rights  in  accordance
    with Regulation 21B(2) of the Regulations. The notice also stated  that
    the decision was not appealable.

The purported EEA appeal against revocation and removal

 7. By an appeal notice dated 11 June 2015, the appellant appealed  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State to cancel his EEA residence card
    and to remove him from the United Kingdom.

 8. The appellant says that this appeal  was  assigned  the  appeal  number
    IA/22186/2015, and this is borne out by the notice of hearing dated  11
    March 2016 for the hearing of appeal  number  IA/22185/2015  at  Hatton
    Cross on 28 September  2016.   This  notice  of  hearing  contains  the
    reference number CEU/4869355 which corresponds to the reference  number
    on the appeal notice of 11 June 2015.

The refusal of ILR in October 2015

 9. On 16 October 2015 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing
    the appellant's application for ILR which had  been  made  in  December
    2014. With regard to the period following the expiry of his last  grant
    of leave to remain, it was accepted that his EEA  national  spouse  was
    exercising her Treaty rights in the United Kingdom  during  June  2012,
    when he was issued with a residence permit.  But he had been unable  to
    provide evidence to demonstrate that she had continued to reside in the
    United Kingdom in accordance with the Regulations thereafter.   So  the
    period for which he had been the spouse of  an  EEA  national  was  not
    accepted to contribute to the 10-year legal leave period  as  a  whole.
    The Secretary of State was not prepared to exercise discretion  in  his
    circumstances.  Furthermore, it was noted that during  the  enforcement
    visit on 7 June 2015, he had stated that he had been separated from his
    EEA national spouse for a year.  All the  officers  were  in  agreement
    that he was not in a genuine and subsisting relationship, and  that  he
    had used marriage to gain leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom.   He
    could not answer details regarding his wife's  circumstances,  nor  her
    current whereabouts.

The appeal against the refusal of ILR

10. Law Lane Solicitors settled the appellant's appeal against this refusal
    decision.  They said that his residence card  had  been  revoked  on  3
    September 2015. (There is no documentary evidence of this. It  will  be
    noted that the appellant had earlier said that his card was revoked  on
    the day of the enforcement visit. Mr  Ojukutola  complained  before  me
    that the respondent had not produced in evidence a notice  of  decision
    to revoke his  residence  card.  But  it  is  the  appellant,  not  the
    respondent, who asserts that his card has been revoked.)

11. With regard to the reasons given for refusing ILR, they submitted  that
    the appellant was genuinely married to his EEA  national  sponsor,  and
    she had been exercising her Treaty rights as a worker  during  all  the
    time that he had been  with  her.   There  was  a  gap  in  his  lawful
    residence, but the respondent should have exercised her  discretion  to
    disregard it, as the appellant had not intended to remain in the United
    Kingdom in breach of the Immigration Rules - rather, he had made  every
    effort to regularise his stay.

Subsequent developments

12. As is common ground, the appellant's appeal against the refusal of  ILR
    was assigned the appeal number IA/33868/2015.

13. Regrettably, the appeals were not consolidated.  As  previously  noted,
    the appellant and his solicitors were notified in March 2016  that  his
    EEA appeal would be heard at Hatton Cross on 28 September 2016.   On  3
    August 2016 the appellant and his solicitors  were  notified  that  the
    hearing of appeal number IA/33868/2015 would take place at Hatton Cross
    on 5 January 2017.

14. As set out in a letter to the Tribunal at Hatton Cross dated 5  January
    2017, the appellant's solicitors say that they  erroneously  overlooked
    the different appeal numbers on the  respective  hearing  notices,  and
    they wrongly assumed that the hearing due to take place on 28 September
    2016 had been vacated so as to be heard on 5 January 2017.  Also,  they
    were aware that they had lodged two appeals for  the  same  client,  so
    they assumed that both appeals had been consolidated by the Tribunal.

The Decision of the  First-tier Tribunal

15. Judge Iqbal proceeded with the hearing of appeal  number  IA/22185/2015
    at Hatton Cross on 28 September 2016 in the absence  of  representation
    from either the appellant or the respondent.  Her  reasoning  was  that
    both parties had been given ample notice of the date  of  the  hearing,
    pursuant to Rule 28 of the Procedure Rules 2014.  She took into account
    all the documentation placed before her.  This included the  notice  of
    refusal, the appellant's notices of appeal, and all  the  documentation
    submitted  by  the  appellant  in  connection  with  the  appeal.   The
    respondent had submitted a bundle received on 12 May 2016.

16. In paragraph [23] of her subsequent decision, she said that  there  was
    an Immigration Report from the visit carried  out  at  the  appellant's
    residence, where the Immigration Officers concluded that  the  marriage
    was one of convenience. The  Judge  observed  that  there  was  nothing
    before her to demonstrate  that  this  was  a  simple  breakdown  of  a
    marriage rather than a marriage of convenience.  In any case, she  said
    that it was irrelevant to the issues which she had to  decide,  as  the
    appellant's EEA residence permit had been revoked on 3 September  2015,
    after the appellant had completed 10 years' residence.

17. At paragraphs [24]-[28], the Judge gave her reasons  for  holding  that
    the appellant did not qualify under the Rules for ILR on the grounds of
    long residence.  She also stated, at paragraph [28], that the appellant
    had failed to put forward any matters to establish a private life claim
    under Rule 276ADE and he had not highlighted any  circumstances  as  to
    why the matter should be considered outside the Rules.

Discussion

18. There was no communication from the Tribunal  which  indicated  to  the
    appellant's solicitors that the two appeals had been  consolidated,  or
    that the hearing scheduled for 28 September 2016 had been adjourned  to
    5 January 2017.  So, I find that the failure by the appellant  and  his
    legal representatives to attend the hearing before  Judge  Iqbal  flows
    entirely from an error on the part of the appellant's solicitors.

19. However, the position for the appellant is salvaged by  the  fact  that
    the Judge fortuitously disposed of the wrong appeal.  The appeal  which
    was supposed to have been heard on 28 September  2016  was  the  appeal
    against the EEA decision to remove the appellant for abuse  of  rights.
    While the Judge made a  finding  relevant  to  this  appeal,  she  also
    addressed the subject matter of the other appeal, which  the  appellant
    had been informed would be heard on 5 January 2017.

20. It is entirely understandable that Judge Iqbal should believe that  she
    was supposed to deal with the appeal against the  refusal  of  ILR,  as
    this can reasonably be characterised as the appellant's main appeal and
    the evidence lodged by  the  appellant's  solicitors  related  to  both
    appeals. It was not brought to the Judge's attention  that  there  were
    two distinct appeals.

21. The upshot is that the appellant has been deprived of an  oral  hearing
    of his main appeal, which he was informed would not take place until  5
    January 2017.  So the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  vitiated
    by a procedural irregularity such that the decision must be set aside.

Future Disposal

22. I note that a Judge at Hatton Cross has queried whether  the  appellant
    has a right of appeal in respect of the EEA decision. I infer that  the
    query arises from the fact that the decision is expressly stated to  be
    not appealable. The issue can be addressed as a preliminary issue at  a
    consolidated hearing of both appeals. There is  a  common  question  of
    fact arising  in  both  appeals  -  whether  the  marriage  is  one  of
    convenience and/or whether the estranged spouse was  exercising  treaty
    rights throughout the remainder of the relevant ten year period, so  as
    to trigger the potential exercise of discretion to count  residence  as
    the spouse of an EEA national towards the accrual of ten years'  lawful
    residence - so the evidence bearing upon these matters will need to  be
    deployed in any event whether there is a valid EEA appeal or not.





Conclusion

23. There was a defect of a procedural nature in the proceedings before the
    First-tier Tribunal which amounts to a material error of law  requiring
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to be set aside, as the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge inadvertently decided the wrong appeal.

Directions

24. Appeal number IA/33868/2015 shall be consolidated  with  appeal  number
    IA/22185/2015.

25. Both appeals are remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  at  Hatton  Cross
    for a de novo consolidated hearing of both  appeals  (Judge  Iqbal  not
    compatible), with none of the findings of  fact  made  by  Judge  Iqbal
    being preserved.

I make no anonymity direction.
