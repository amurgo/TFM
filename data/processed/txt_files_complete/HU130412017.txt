Representation:
For the Appellant:          Mr Islam, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Presenting Officer


                                                  DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who  had  appealed  against  the
   decision of the respondent dated 20 September 2017  to  refuse  to  grant
   them leave to enter the United Kingdom pursuant to his family  life  with
   his spouse in the United Kingdom. First-tier Tribunal Judge Jessica Pacey
   dismissed the appellant's appeal in a decision dated, 6  August  2018  on
   "human rights grounds."


2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-Tribunal  Judge  Beach  stating
   that it is arguable that the Judge miscalculated his  sponsor's  earnings
   by calculating seven months earnings as opposed to 6 months  which  would
   have proved that the sponsor was earning the required  income  under  the
   immigration rules.

3. At the hearing Mr Islam explained how the error in the  calculation  came
   about. He said that the appellant provided  six  months'  payslips  which
   demonstrated that she would earn ï¿½18,800 a year. Mr Lindsay on behalf  of
   the respondent said that the key issue was that  the  appellant  had  not
   provided her employer's letter which is a mandatory requirement under FM-
   SE 3.2.2 (b). She said although an accountant's letter had been  provided
   but that does not mean the accountant  is  has  been  authorised  by  the
   sponsor's employer. She further said that there is no document  from  the
   employer to demonstrate that the accountant is acting for  the  sponsor's
   employer. She further stated  that  the  sponsor  left  her  husband  and
   children in Bangladesh and chose to come to the  United  Kingdom  leaving
   her children behind.

4. The appellant's  three  children  live  in  Bangladesh.  The  sponsor  is
   applying for entry clearance on his own with the intention of leaving the
   children in Bangladesh to be looked after by their aunt. At the  hearing,
   the Judge records that the sponsor stated that after her husband comes to
   the United Kingdom, they would apply for the children to join  them.  She
   said that they did not apply together because she did not have sufficient
   income to meet the requirements of the immigration rules.

5. At the hearing there was no evidence from  the  sponsor's  employer  that
   the accountants report has been produced and authorised by  the  sponsors
   employer. I accept the Home Office presenting Officer's submissions  that
   a  letter  from  the  employer  is  a  mandatory  requirement  under  the
   immigration rules.  The  appellant  has  not  provided  this  letter  and
   therefore cannot succeed under the immigration rules.

6. I find that the Judge did not  make  a  material  error  of  law  in  her
   assessment of Article 8 and nor was it  specifically  raised.  I  however
   find her assessment is  through  and  it  takes  into  account  the  best
   interests of the appellant's three children. The appellant did  not  meet
   the requirements of the immigration rules and the Judge was  entitled  to
   find that the interference  of  the  appellant's  family  life  with  his
   sponsor is proportionate. It is a decision made by the appellant and  the
   sponsor for the sponsor to leave her family in Bangladesh and go  to  the
   United Kingdom. It is not a decision imposed upon them.


7. In considering the totality of the  decision  I  am  not  satisfied  that
   there is a material error of law or fact in the  decision.  There  is  no
   perversity in the reasoning and the Judge's conclusion on the evidence. I
   find that no differently constituted Tribunal  would  come  to  different
   conclusion on the facts of this case.
