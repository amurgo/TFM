For the Appellant:     Mr M Hassan of Counsel, Hossain Law Associates
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh.  He appealed  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal against a decision of the respondent of 11 September 2015
    refusing his application for a residence card  as  an  extended  family
    member of an EEA national.  The judge, in light of the decision of  the
    Upper Tribunal in Sala [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC) decided that  there  was
    no right of appeal and no jurisdiction in the Tribunal to consider  the
    matter before it.

2.   Permission to appeal against that decision was granted by  a  Judge  of
    the Upper Tribunal in light of the decision in  Khan  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
    1755 which found that Sala had been wrongly decided.

3.   In a Rule 24 response, upon which Ms Fijiwala, who appeared  on  behalf
    of the respondent relied, an adjournment was sought  until  the  matter
    was resolved by the forthcoming decision of the  Supreme  Court  in  SM
    (Algeria).

4.   I conclude however that the preferred option in light of the fact  that
    Khan remains good law, is for the matter to be remitted for  a  hearing
    in the First-tier Tribunal.  It is of course open to the respondent  if
    she so wishes to seek  an  adjournment  from  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    pending the decision in SM (Algeria).

No anonymity direction is made.
