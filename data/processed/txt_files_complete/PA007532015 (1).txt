Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr M Moriarty, in-house Counsel, instructed by
                    Luqmani Thompson Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is a remade appeal against the respondent's decision served on
        15 July 2015 to refuse the appellant's  human  rights  (article  8)
        claim. On the same date the respondent  also  made  a  decision  to
        deport the appellant under the automatic deportation provisions  of
        the UK Borders Act 2007. In a decision promulgated on 24 March 2017
        I identified material errors of law  in  the  earlier  decision  of
        Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Ford  (FtJ)  who  dismissed  the
        appellant's appeal. In brief summary, I found that the  FtJ  failed
        to ascertain whether deportation would actually  result  in  unduly
        harsh consequences for the  appellant's  partner  and  children,  a
        necessary step in order to then determine whether there were  'very
        compelling circumstances' over and  above  consequences  that  were
        unduly harsh pursuant to paragraph 398  of  the  immigration  rules
        (see Greenwood (No. 2) (para  398  considered)  [2015]  UKUT  00629
        (IAC)), it being accepted that, as a result of his  6  year  prison
        sentence, the applicant could not meet the exceptions in paragraphs
        399 and 399A. I additionally found the FtJ's decision unsafe on the
        basis that she may have applied an  unlawfully  high  threshold  by
        misquoting the requirements of paragraph  398  of  the  immigration
        rules and section  117C(6)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 2002. Finally, the FtJ's conclusion that the appellant's
        partner  (NT)  was  not  a  full-time  student   was   reached   in
        circumstances where the FtJ failed to indicate this concern to  the
        parties, which amounted to a procedural irregularity. Although  the
        FtJ also dismissed an appeal by the appellant against  the  refusal
        of his asylum claim he has not sought to challenge this  particular
        decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


     2. In light of further evidence that has been served by the  appellant
        in accordance  with  rule  15  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
        Tribunal) Rules 2008 I adjourned the appeal for a  further  hearing
        before myself.

   The appellant's immigration history


     3. The appellant is a national of Jamaica, born on  27  May  1983.  He
        entered the United Kingdom on 7 April 2001 as  a  visitor  aged  17
        with entry clearance valid until 28 April 2001. On  27  April  2001
        his representatives made an application on his behalf  for  further
        leave to remain as a visitor  until  October  of  that  year.  This
        application was refused on 29 May 2001 and an appeal  against  this
        decision was dismissed on 15 March 2002. Thereafter  the  appellant
        sought leave to remain as a student and on the basis of his  rights
        under  article  8  ECHR.  These  applications  were  refused.   The
        appellant has been an  overstayer  since  his  appeal  rights  were
        exhausted in 2002. A notice of liability to  automatic  deportation
        dated 12 July 2011 was served on the appellant. He  claimed  asylum
        on 27 August 2013. His claim related to a fear of being targeted in
        Jamaica by a gang as a result of actions of his cousin.  A  further
        notice of liability to automatic deportation,  dated  20  September
        2013, was then served on the appellant. The appellant  underwent  a
        substantive asylum interview in August 2014. He was served with the
        refusal of his asylum and human rights claims on 15 July  2015.  In
        refusing the appellant's asylum claim the respondent also certified
        it under section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
        2002.

      The appellant's criminal history


     4. Since arriving in the United Kingdom the appellant has  received  7
        convictions for 20 known offences. He  was  first  convicted  on  3
        March 2003 for being concerned in the supply of a controlled  Class
        A drug  and  handling  stolen  goods,  driving  otherwise  than  in
        accordance with a licence, and using a vehicle while uninsured.  He
        was sentenced to  12  months  imprisonment  at  a  Young  Offenders
        Institution. On the same occasion the appellant was also  convicted
        of supplying a controlled Class A drug and possessing a  controlled
        drug with intent to supply. For these offences he received  two  18
        month sentences of imprisonment, which  were  served  concurrently,
        but consecutively with the 12 month sentence. He was also convicted
        of possession of ammunition without a certificate and sentenced  to
        a period of 3 months served concurrently. He therefore  received  a
        total sentence of two years and 6 months imprisonment.


     5. On 10 October 2003 the appellant  was  convicted  of  possessing  a
        controlled Class B drug and was fined �100 and ordered to  pay  �50
        costs.  On  9  November  2004  the  appellant  was   convicted   of
        fraudulently using a vehicle without a licence, driving  a  vehicle
        otherwise than in accordance with a licence, and  using  a  vehicle
        while uninsured. He received fines in the sums  of  �20,  �30,  and
        �250 respectively. On 1 August 2009 the appellant was convicted  of
        using a vehicle while  uninsured  and  driving  otherwise  than  in
        accordance with a licence, for which he was fined �100. On 20 April
        2010 the appellant was convicted of having an article with a  blade
        in a public place and received a suspended  sentence  of  6  weeks,
        wholly suspended for 12 months. On 29 November 2010  the  appellant
        was convicted of having in his possession a controlled Class B drug
        and fined �100. On the same  date  he  was  convicted  of  using  a
        vehicle while uninsured and of having committed a  further  offence
        during the  operational  period  of  a  suspended  sentence  order,
        resulting from the original conviction on 20 April 2010, and  fined
        �400.


     6. On 31  May  2011  the  appellant  was  convicted  on  2  counts  of
        possession of a Class A controlled drug with  intent  to  supply  -
        heroin and  crack  cocaine,  and  a  failure  to  comply  with  the
        community requirements  of  a  suspended  sentence  order.  He  was
        sentenced to two concurrent terms of 6 years imprisonment  for  the
        two counts of possession of the Class A drugs. The circumstances of
        the offence related to an incident  on  11  August  2010  when  the
        appellant was stopped by police in the street and found  to  be  in
        possession of 2.48g of heroin and 1.66g  of  crack  cocaine.  These
        drugs were hidden down his trousers in a net  bag.  He  made  a  no
        comment interview and put forward a  prepared  statement  that  was
        bogus. The jury rejected his claim that  the  drugs  were  for  his
        personal consumption. This was his third  conviction  for  Class  A
        drugs,  although  the  other  offences  took   place   some   years
        previously. The sentencing judge noted that possession with  intent
        to supply Class A drugs was a very serious matter.

      The respondent's decision


     7.  The  appellant's  article  8  human  rights  claim  rests  on  his
        relationship with  his  British  citizen  partner,  NT,  their  two
        daughters, N (born in October 2011) and A (born in June 2015),  and
        his relationship with another daughter, K, born to another  British
        National (KJ) in November 2009. The respondent  accepted  that  the
        appellant had a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with N
        and K (A had  not  been  born  at  the  date  of  the  respondent's
        decision), that he had a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with
        NT, and that his partner and children were  British  citizens.  The
        respondent  was  nevertheless  satisfied   that   the   appellant's
        offending was so serious that his deportation would not  result  in
        an unduly harsh impact on his children  or  his  partner  and  that
        there were no very compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  the
        exceptions in paragraphs 399 and 399A of the immigration rules that
        would outweigh the public interest in his  deportation  and  render
        his deportation disproportionate.

The evidence

     8. The applicant provided a large bundle of documents  that  included,
        inter alia, a statement from  him,  two  statements  from  NT,  two
        statements from KJ, a statement from HE  (the  appellant's  father)
        dated 19 November 2015, two statements  from  MR  (the  appellant's
        mother in law), documentation relating to NT's  studies,  an  OASys
        report dated 03 November 2016, a  probation  report  dated  23  May
        2011, the pre-discharge report dated 26 January 2014, a  number  of
        documents relating  to  rehabilitative  courses  completed  by  the
        appellant in prison, passports and birth certificates  relating  to
        the appellant's children, a letter from the Nursery Manager of  the
        Yvonne Kerr Childcare Group, a letter dated 23 February  2016  from
        the Head Teacher of St James's Church of  England  Primary  School,
        medical evidence and evidence relating to the award  of  Disability
        Living Allowance in respect of MR, a number of  family  photographs
        (showing, inter alia, the appellant and his daughters with extended
        family members), several educational  and  vocational  certificates
        relating to the  appellant,  an  Independent  Social  Worker  (ISW)
        report prepared by Christine Brown dated 3 March 2016, and a number
        of background reports on Jamaica, with a focus on the dangers posed
        by criminal gangs.


     9. At the hearing the appellant adopted his statement which was signed
        and  dated  22  February  2016.  In  his  statement  the  appellant
        described the chaotic lifestyle that caused him to commit offences.
        He had not taken drugs since his release in 2014. He did  not  wish
        to do anything to jeopardise his relationship with his  family.  If
        allowed to remain in the UK he would work to support his family. He
        was a qualified painter and decorator as well as a  motor  mechanic
        and  music  engineer  and  producer.  He  and  NT  commence   their
        relationship around 2006 or 2007. The applicant  described  how  he
        was involved in his children's lives. The only family he  had  left
        in Jamaica where his grandparents who were in a care home.


    10. In examination in chief the appellant indicated that he  last  took
        illegal drugs in 2011. He  completed  a  number  of  rehabilitation
        programs in Rochester prison and Kent prison. Since being  released
        he stayed indoors  most  of  the  time  and  spent  time  with  his
        children. He was the primary carer for A and N. He  picked  up  his
        other daughter, K, from school 2 or 3 times a week as KJ had a part-
        time job. On an average day he would get up early because  NT  went
        to college and he had to get N ready for  school.  He  did  regular
        "daddy stuff" with A involving changing nappies, play and nap time.


    11. Prior to his release from detention A and N had no contact with  K.
        Now they would see each other at least twice a week. The  appellant
        did not believe there was anyone  else  who  could  facilitate  the
        interaction between his 3 daughters. No one else in his family  was
        acquainted with K because they were busy people and he  mainly  saw
        his other family members on a Sunday. NT and KJ did  not  associate
        with each other. The appellant did not think A or N would  be  able
        to visit him in Jamaica because NT would not be able to afford  it.
        K was even less likely to visit  because  KJ  was  not  financially
        stable and was in a relationship with another man. If his daughters
        were not able to visit him it would be emotionally devastating  for
        them.


    12. In cross-examination the appellant confirmed that  he  remained  in
        custody from 20 April 2011,  the  date  of  his  conviction,  until
        released from prison on 19 May 2014. He could not recall whether NT
        or KJ were working during this time but believed  that  NT  was  in
        receipt of benefits. Both NT and KJ were born in  the  UK  and  had
        family members in the UK. If allowed to stay  the  appellant  would
        seek employment. He rejected a suggestion that  this  would  expose
        him to temptations of criminality. If he had a job he would not  be
        misled. He began to take cannabis quite early in life  and  started
        on the "hard stuff" (Class A drugs) around 2005 or 2006. When asked
        again whether any of his other family  members  would  be  able  to
        facilitate  interaction  between  his  3  daughters  the  appellant
        explained  that  his  family  were  hard-working,  that  they   had
        mortgages to pay off, and that it was quite difficult for  them  to
        look after children. he had 3 aunts in the UK  with  children,  the
        youngest of which was 17 years old. None of  his  family  would  be
        able to even  occasionally  assist  in  bringing  his  3  daughters
        together. The appellant's father imported goods  into  the  UK  and
        never seemed to be willing to take his grandchildren and have them.
        The appellant had 2 aunts living in London and one aunt  living  in
        Birmingham with grown up children. The appellant  had  never  asked
        the Birmingham aunt whether she could arrange get-togethers between
        his 3 daughters but it was unlikely that she would be  prepared  to
        do so. The appellant confirmed that he had only met the independent
        social worker on one occasion.


    13. In response to questions from me the appellant said that both  NT's
        parents lived in Birmingham. She had a sister with whom she did not
        get along. NT also had a half-brother but  the  appellant  did  not
        know where he lived. NT did not socialise a lot with  her  cousins.
        KJ also had her parents in  Birmingham.  KJ  had  a  sister  and  2
        brothers who also lived in Birmingham.


    14. NT adopted her two  statements  in  which  she  described  how  her
        relationship with the appellant commenced and  his  involvement  in
        childcare and the household (cooking, cleaning, taking the children
        to school, getting them up, putting them to bed,  taking  them  out
        and playing with them). She found it difficult as a  single  mother
        when the appellant was in custody. She was unable to study or  work
        and found it exhausting. She was currently enrolled full-time on an
        Early Years Foundation  Course,  was  at  college  from  Monday  to
        Wednesday and on Thursday and Friday she was on a  placement  at  a
        nursery. After graduating in July 2017 she wanted to obtain a BA in
        integrated working with children and families. She  had  a  limited
        income, was reliant on a student loan, and would be unable  to  pay
        for childcare. Whilst she had family members  who  enjoyed  looking
        after the children occasionally she could not rely on them to  take
        care of them 4 days a week while she studied or was  on  placement,
        and she had to care for her mother  who  was  reliant  on  her  for
        emotional and practical support. She could not relocate to  Jamaica
        because she feared her former husband, had no family there, grew up
        and was educated in the  UK,  and  would  have  difficulty  finding
        employment. The appellant's deportation would  be  devastating  for
        her and her children and she could not afford to visit.


    15. In  examination-in-chief  she  confirmed  that  she  was  currently
        undertaking  a  full-time  Early   Years   Foundation   Course   at
        university. This would finish in July  2017.  If  she  successfully
        passed the course she would attain a Level 5 Early Years Foundation
        degree which would enable her to act as  a  teaching  assistant,  a
        nursery manager, or a family support worker. She would like to do a
        further year of study to enable her to qualify as a teacher.  While
        NT was at university the appellant was the primary carer of their 2
        daughters. NT relied on him to do everything  such  as  taking  and
        collecting their oldest child from school  and  looking  after  the
        baby. The  appellant  was  a  good  father  and  dedicated  to  his
        children. NT did not speak to KJ. N, A and K got to see each  other
        through their father. The 3 children would see each other 3 times a
        week, sometimes more. If the appellant were deported  NT  would  be
        traumatised. Things would be very different without his  help.  For
        example, he helped his mother-in-law after her knee operation. NT's
        mother could not stand for too long and needed  help  with  various
        things such as cooking, cleaning, and being taken to  appointments.
        NT  provided  care  to  her  mother  with  the  assistance  of  the
        appellant. NT's grandparents were too old to  help  their  daughter
        and she had no other children of her own.


    16. It would be expensive and difficult to take her  daughters  to  see
        the appellant if he were deported.  The  effect  on  her  daughters
        would be devastating as they both loved their father. NT  would  be
        unable to afford  the  expense  of  childcare.  Although  childcare
        vouchers were available this would not  be  enough.  Later  in  her
        evidence, in response to questions from  me,  NT  stated  that  the
        childcare vouchers would be available when  her  youngest  daughter
        turned 2 (in June 2017) and that these would cover 15 hours'  worth
        of childcare a week.


    17. In cross-examination NT said that she had 2 half siblings  -  Julia
        and Matthew. One lived in  Birmingham,  the  other  in  Essex.  The
        appellant had been influenced by a bad crowd when he arrived in the
        UK. Her mother lived a 15 to 20 minute car journey from their home.
        Between 2011 and 2014 (when the appellant was in  custody)  NT  was
        unemployed and received social benefits. She did not  receive  help
        from her family with childcare. Her mother was unable to look after
        the children and she did not have a good relationship with her half
        siblings. When asked whether the appellant's family could  not  act
        as 'go-betweens' in terms of facilitating interaction between the 3
        children, NT answered, "no, I don't know of any reasons why."


    18. NT began her full-time studies in 2015. She had  been  aware  since
        2011 that the appellant  had  been  the  subject  of  a  notice  of
        automatic  deportation.  She  was  additionally  aware   that   the
        appellant made an asylum claim in 2013, which was refused in  2015.
        When asked  whether  she  was  aware  that  the  Home  Office  were
        intending to deport  the  appellant  when  her  current  course  of
        studies commenced, NT said, "I'm not really sure what I  was  aware
        of." She didn't really have friends and her mother and her  partner
        and children were her world. In response to some questions from  me
        NT indicated that she had a few convictions a  long  time  ago  for
        shoplifting. When I informed that the  appellant  said  she  had  a
        sister NT said that they were waiting for DNA proof. The person who
        may or may not be a sister somebody her  father  found  out  about.
        NT's mother does have other  children  but  they  live  with  their
        father abroad NT did not know why the appellant didn't refer to the
        "sister" as a half-sister or in respect of whom a question remained
        of her relationship. When I asked whether  any  approach  had  been
        made to the local authority to obtain support  for  her  mother  NT
        said "they don't  do  that  anymore,  they  scrapped  it."  In  re-
        examination my attention was drawn to a letter from Disability  and
        Carer's Service, dated 31  December  2015  and  addressed  to  NT's
        mother, relating to her claim for DLA. NT once again stated,  "they
        don't do that anymore."


    19. KJ adopted her two statements. In addition to K she now had a  son.
        She lived very close to the appellant's home. She and the appellant
        were committed to bringing  up  their  daughter  together.  KJ  was
        working part-time and the appellant would often do the  school  run
        with their daughter. He picked her up from school 3 or  4  times  a
        week. On days they did not see each other they would  chat  on  the
        phone. K enjoyed the time she spent with the appellant  and  talked
        about him all of the time.  She  has  seen  a  big  change  in  the
        appellant since his release. His focus now is  on  his  family.  It
        would be devastating if he were deported and would have  a  massive
        negative impact on K's ability to focus  and  her  emotional  well-
        being. K was also attached to her  half-sisters  and  the  children
        loved spending time together. If the appellant was not present  the
        girls would hardly see each other. The father of her son was in the
        UK and KJ would not consider moving anywhere  else.  KJ  could  not
        afford to pay the plane tickets.


    20. In examination in  chief  KJ  said  that  the  appellant  sometimes
        collects K from school, takes her to gymnastics  on  Thursday,  and
        takes her to his house so that K  could  interact  with  her  half-
        sisters. On average K saw her halfsiblings 3 or sometimes 4 times a
        week, although sometimes it is only twice a week. The appellant was
        described as a very good father who was a big help to KJ.  She  did
        have family  but  couldn't  really  depend  on  them.  She  had  no
        relationship with NT. When the appellant was first  incarcerated  K
        was very young. Because she had not seen him for a while she became
        cold to the  "whole  father/daughter  situation".  Since  then  the
        relationship has been rebuilt. If the appellant  were  deported  it
        would break K's heart. It would also place  great  stress  upon  KJ
        because she would have to deal with her daughter's emotions.  There
        will be virtually no chance of K visiting the appellant in  Jamaica
        because KJ had a son as well and it  will  be  too  expensive.  The
        father of her son was currently on remand in respect of a  firearms
        offence and had no present role in her son's life.


    21. In cross-examination KJ said that both her parents lived in the  UK
        as did her 3 siblings. They all lived in Birmingham. Her  siblings,
        who were 13 years old, 20 and 21 years old, lived with KJ's mother.
        Between April 2011 and May 2014 KJ received benefits. Although  she
        received help from her family during that time she still struggled.
        If she worked past school hours there was no  one  else  who  could
        pick K up. Although anything was possible JK  did  not  believe  it
        will be possible for her and NT to take their daughters to  a  park
        so that they could play without any interaction between the adults.


    22.  Both  representatives  made  submissions  which  have  been  fully
        recorded by me and which  I  have  fully  taken  into  account.  Mr
        Moriarty relied on both the skeleton argument prepared for the  1st
        Tier Tribunal hearing and the skeleton argument  prepared  for  the
        error of law hearing.


      My assessment


    23. It is for the appellant to prove that  the  decision  under  appeal
        interferes with article 8, and  the  standard  is  the  balance  of
        probabilities. Once  there  is  an  established  interference  with
        article 8 it is for the respondent to justify that interference.


    24. It is not in dispute that the appellant is a foreign  criminal  who
        received a sentence of imprisonment of more than 4 years. Nor is it
        in dispute that, under the immigration rules (paragraphs  398,  399
        and  399A),  the  public  interest  in  his  deportation  is   only
        outweighed  by  other  factors  if  there  are   'very   compelling
        circumstances' over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and
        399A. The appellant therefore has to  demonstrate  that  there  are
        very compelling circumstances over and  above  a  finding  that  it
        would be unduly harsh to expect his partner  and  his  children  to
        remain in the UK without him, or for them to live in  Jamaica  with
        him.


    25. I must additionally take into account the public  interest  factors
        relevant to the article 8 proportionality assessment identified  in
        sections 117A to D of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
        2002 (the 2002 Act). s.117C(6) establishes that, in the case  of  a
        foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment
        of at least 4  years,  the  public  interest  requires  deportation
        unless there are very compelling circumstances over and above those
        described in exceptions 1 and 2. Exception 2,  which  is  the  only
        relevant exception, applies where a foreign criminal has a  genuine
        and subsisting relationship  with  the  qualifying  partner,  or  a
        genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a  qualifying
        child, and the effect of the foreign criminal's deportation on  the
        partner or child is unduly harsh. As  this  appeal  involves  minor
        children  I  must  apply  s.55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
        Immigration Act 2009 and treat the best interests of  the  children
        as  a  primary  consideration,  although  it  is  not  a  paramount
        consideration. I remind myself that in EJA v SSHD [2017]  EWCA  Civ
        10, Burnett LJ, having cited the judgment of Lord  Reed  in  Hesham
        Ali [2016] UKSC 60, observed, "It is abundantly clear  that  Hashem
        Ali (sic) has not lowered the  significant  hurdle  which  must  be
        overcome by a foreign criminal to succeed in demonstrating that  it
        would be disproportionate to deport him from the United Kingdom." I
        further remind myself that in NE-A (Nigeria) v Secretary  of  State
        for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 239  The  Court  of  Appeal
        confirmed that sections 117A-117D, taken together, are intended  to
        provide for a structured approach to the application of  article  8
        which produces in all cases a final result which is compatible with
        that article.


         In particular, if in working through the structured  approach  one
         gets to section 117C(6), the proper application of that  provision
         produces a final result compatible with Article 8 in all cases  to
         which it applies. The provision contains more than a statement  of
         policy to which regard must be had as  a  relevant  consideration.
         Parliament's  assessment  that  "the  public   interest   requires
         deportation unless there are very compelling  circumstances,  over
         and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2" is one  to  which
         the tribunal is bound by law to  give  effect.  (per  Sir  Stephen
         Richards, at [14])


    26. I am satisfied, and indeed it was not challenged by Mr Jarvis, that
        the appellant has a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  NT,
        and that he has a genuine parental relationship with K, N and A. NT
        and the appellant's daughters are British citizens,  and  all  were
        born in the UK. An undated letter from the Nursery Manager  of  the
        Yvonne Kerr Childcare Group confirmed that the appellant  was  very
        active in N's life and that she had a close bond with him. A letter
        dated 23 February 2016 from the Head Teacher of St  James's  Church
        of England Primary School confirmed that the appellant attended all
        parental workshops and parent carer partnership  meetings  and  was
        well known to all staff associated with K. The letter  additionally
        indicated that the appellant dropped and collected her from school.
        Even though the appellant does not live with K, and sees  her  less
        regularly then his other 2 daughters, it is clear from the totality
        of the evidence that the appellant has a strong bond with all 3  of
        his daughters. Whilst NT is studying during  the  week  he  is  the
        primary carer of N and A, although N now attends school.  I  accept
        that the appellant  has  been  active  in  the  lives  of  all  his
        daughters and that  he  is  a  good  and  committed  father.  I  am
        satisfied  that  it  is  in  the  best  interests  of  all  of  the
        appellant's daughters for him to remain in the  UK.  The  appellant
        does not have a relationship with  KJ,  although  they  communicate
        well with each other in respect of  facilitating  the  relationship
        between the appellant and K.


    27.  In  order  to  determine  whether  there   are   very   compelling
        circumstances 'over and above' an unduly harsh impact on  NT  as  a
        result of the  appellant's  deportation,  I  must  first  determine
        whether the effect on her would be unduly harsh. I  will  focus  my
        attention on whether it would be unduly harsh for NT to  remain  in
        the  UK  without  the  appellant.  In   determining   whether   the
        appellant's deportation would be unduly harsh I  am  bound  by  the
        Court of Appeal  decision  in  MM  (Uganda)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  450
        (holding that wider public interest considerations  must  be  taken
        into account when applying the "unduly harsh" criterion).


    28.  I  accept  that  the  appellant's   deportation   would   have   a
        significantly detrimental impact on his relationship with NT.  They
        have been in a relationship for approximately  10  years,  although
        for some of this time the appellant was in prison and, prior to his
        arrest for his index  offence,  was  living  in  London  while  she
        remained in Birmingham. NT would  lose  the  direct  emotional  and
        practical support provided by her partner and the intimacy that  is
        a vital component of any partner relationship. Although  NT  claims
        that she would be traumatised if the appellant were deported  there
        is no medical evidence supporting this assertion.


    29. I have taken account of the evidence relating  to  the  appellant's
        rehabilitation. The sentencing judge recognised that the  appellant
        had done "a great deal" to kick his habit. He had, at the  time  of
        his sentence, liaised with the CARAT Team and had a positive letter
        written on behalf by a councillor from the community drug  service.
        The documents before me indicated  that  the  appellant  completed,
        amongst others,  a  heroin  workshop,  a  'triggers  and  cravings'
        workshop, a number of drug awareness  sessions  and  the  'stepping
        stones drug program'. According to the ISW  report  the  appellant,
        whilst in  custody,  became  a  prison  mentor  and  qualified  for
        Category D's status early into his  sentence.  He  spent  6  months
        going through a controlled detox  program  with  continued  testing
        throughout this period. He informed Ms  Brown  that  the  impending
        birth of his  child  with  NT  was  the  impetus  for  him  seeking
        treatment.  I  note  in  addition  the  City  and  Guilds  and  OCR
        certificates awarded to the appellant.


  30. I have considered the  various  probation  and  prison  documents  and
      reports in the appellant's bundle. In a NOMS report  that  appears  to
      have been completed sometime in 2012 the  appellant  was  assessed  as
      being at low risk of serious harm to the public and  at  low  risk  of
      reoffending, and that his behaviour whilst in custody was described as
      being "exemplary". The November  2016  OASys  report  noted  that  the
      appellant admitted his responsibility for his  criminal  offences  and
      did not seek to diminish  his  actions,  that  he  came  across  as  a
      positive young man, and that he appeared to have gained some  valuable
      lessons from his prison sentence. This  OASys  report  reiterated  the
      appellant's low risk of recidivism but  identified  him  as  posing  a
      medium risk of harm to the public. This does not sit comfortably  with
      the earlier NOMS report. I take account of the fact that it is over  6
      years since the appellant's last conviction.


  31. I am satisfied, based on the above evidence, that  the  appellant  has
      genuinely addressed his drug misuse and  has  taken  active  steps  to
      rehabilitate himself and to remain drug-free. Despite the  conclusions
      of the  OASys report I am satisfied that the appellant is at low  risk
      of causing serious harm to the public and that he is at  low  risk  of
      reoffending. I take this into account in  the  appellant's  favour  in
      assessing the existence of very compelling  circumstances  under  both
      paragraph 398 of the immigration rules and  section  117C(vi)  of  the
      2002 Act, but also, following MM (Uganda)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  450,  in
      determining whether the impact on NT would be 'unduly harsh'.


  32. When assessing whether the impact on NT  would  be  'unduly  harsh'  I
      additionally take account  of  the  delay  in  making  an  immigration
      decision, which reduces the weight of the public interest  factors.  I
      note that the  appellant  was  first  informed  of  his  liability  to
      deportation in July 2011 and that a decision to deport  was  not  made
      until 10 July 2015. The appellant was however a serving prisoner until
      released on  licence  in  April  2014  (when  he  entered  immigration
      detention). In  response  to  further  notices  of  his  liability  to
      deportation sent to him in July and September 2013 he made a number of
      further representations, and made an asylum claim in August 2013 which
      necessitated the application  of  the  asylum  determination  process.
      Whilst I take account of the delay in reducing  the  public  interest,
      this must be balanced against the various public interest  factors  in
      his deportation.

    33. I note from the ISW report that NT was  previously  employed  as  a
        nursery nurse and a shop assistant. I appreciate her natural desire
        to improve her financial  circumstances  by  wishing  to  become  a
        teacher. With the exception of the care she claims to  provide  for
        her mother and childcare  issues,  there  does  not  appear  to  be
        anything preventing her from seeking employment as a nursery  nurse
        or shop assistant or, with the Level 5 certificate that  she  hopes
        to achieve after the  completion  of  her  current  studies,  as  a
        teaching assistant, nursery manager or family support worker.  Even
        if she is, for whatever reason,  unable  to  complete  her  current
        studies,  she  could  seek  alternative  employment,  part-time  if
        necessary, in order to manage her child care  commitments  (I  note
        that she would have access to 15 hours' worth of childcare  support
        once her youngest child reaches the age of 2). Despite NT  claiming
        at the  hearing  that  she  had  no  friends  her  account  of  her
        circumstances to Ms Brown was different (see 3.29 of the ISW report
        where NT informed Ms Brown that she had  many  family  members  and
        friends in the Birmingham area).


    34. Even if it  were  entirely  impossible  for  alternative  childcare
        arrangements to be made, and NT had to give up any hope of  further
        employment (which  I  do  not  accept),  the  fact  of  being  made
        unemployed is not sufficient, in the  particular  circumstances  of
        this appeal, to amount to undue  harshness.  There  is  no  medical
        evidence that NT has any mental or physical health issues. Whilst I
        fully appreciate the undesirability of being  unemployed,  and  the
        difficulties in being a  single  parent  looking  after  two  young
        children, it must be remembered that NT entered into a relationship
        with the appellant at a time when he was unlawfully present in  the
        United Kingdom. Indeed I find that  NT  must  have  undertaken  her
        studies  in  the  full  knowledge  of  the   appellant's   criminal
        convictions and the knowledge that his immigration status  was,  at
        the very least, precarious. NT (and KJ) managed to cope for  the  3
        year period during which the  appellant  was  incarcerated.  During
        this time she received benefits. There is no evidence,  medical  or
        otherwise, suggesting that the safety and  welfare  of  NT  or  her
        children would be compromised if she were rendered  unemployed,  or
        that the family would be rendered destitute.  I  must  additionally
        bear in mind the serious nature of the appellant's offence and  the
        various public interest factors unconnected  with  a  risk  of  re-
        offending (such  as  expression  the  public's  revulsion  of  drug
        offending, the deterrent effect and  the  broad  issues  of  social
        cohesion and public confidence in the administration of immigration
        control).

  35. I have carefully considered the statements from MR and the medical and
      other  documentary  evidence  relating  to  her.  MR  had  full   knee
      replacement  surgery  in  April  2012  which  gave  rise  to   further
      complications requiring subsequent medical procedures  and  a  lot  of
      physiotherapy. She moved in with NT on 24 December 2013,  although  by
      the time the ISW report was prepared in March 2016 she had moved  back
      to her own home. Ms Brown noted that  MR  wanted  to  retain  as  much
      independence and self-management and she could, and that  NT  had  not
      yet needed to undertake any personal care  for  her  mother.  MR  also
      suffers  from  serious  arthritis,  stress  urinary  incontinence  and
      depression.

  36. On 2 occasions during her evidence NT stated that the local  authority
      no longer provided carers or appropriate support for  her  mother.  My
      attention was drawn to a letter, dated 31  December  2015,  issued  by
      Disability and Carer Service and addressed to MR. This related  to  an
      award of DLA. MR was awarded the higher rate of �51.40 p a  week  from
      23 November 2015 for an indefinite period because she was  "unable  or
      virtually unable to walk". MR was not  however  awarded  a  DLA  carer
      component. This was based on information contained in  her  DLA  claim
      form and from her hospital, including details of  her  treatment,  her
      medication and test results and symptoms. The letter  indicated  that,
      although she had difficulty with standing, MR could sit from  time  to
      time when preparing food and didn't need help preparing a cooked  main
      meal for one person. MR could safely get in and out of bed, get up and
      down stairs and get in and out of a chair using suitable aids  at  her
      own speed. She didn't need help from someone for about an hour  a  day
      or several times right through  the  day.  She  was  not  at  risk  of
      falling. There is nothing in the evidence before  me  supporting  NT's
      claim that the local authority or social services no  longer  provides
      appropriate care for individuals in her mother's position. The  letter
      from Disability and Carers Service indicates that MR  was  simply  not
      entitled to the carer component of DLA because she did  not  have  the
      requisite care needs.


  37. Mr Moriarty drew my attention to a GP letter, dated 18 February  2016,
      written some 3 months after MR's DLA award. This  letter,  headed  "to
      whom  it  may  concern"  indicates  that  MR   suffers   from   severe
      osteoarthritis of both  knees  needing  replacements.  She  had  post-
      operative  pain  in  her  left   knee   needing   manipulation   under
      anaesthesia. She also suffers from lower back ache due  to  arthritis,
      depression and urge incontinence. These conditions affect her  ability
      to carry out activities of daily living. She does  suffer  from  falls
      and urinary incontinence and severe pain secondary to  arthritis,  and
      needs help with cooking, cleaning, shopping  and  to  attend  hospital
      appointments. Her depression also negatively impacts on her ability to
      go out. She was said to be very much dependent on her daughter and the
      appellant to carry out activities of daily living. I note in  the  ISW
      report, prepared in March 2016, that NT had not yet had  to  undertake
      some degree of personal care for her mother (for example toileting her
      or bathing her) and that MR was  now  mobilised  with  walking  sticks
      provided by the aids and adaptions team within  the  local  authority.
      Surprisingly there was no more recent medical evidence relating to MR,
      despite the GP letter being dated over a year before the hearing.


  38. The GPs letter  focuses  on  the  mobility  problems  afflicting  NT's
      mother. The earlier letter from Disability and Carer Service indicates
      that NT's mother was capable of cooking meals, that she was capable of
      getting in and out of bed and going up and down stairs, and was not at
      risk of falling. There was nothing in the GP letter to  indicate  that
      there had  been  a  significant  and  serious  deterioration  in  MR's
      condition in the intervening 3 month  period.  If  there  had  been  a
      significant deterioration in MR's condition I  would  have  reasonably
      expected  to  see  more  up-to-date  medical  evidence,  or   evidence
      indicating whether she had applied for or been awarded the  DLA  carer
      component. Even if no further application for  the  relevant  benefits
      was made there is nothing to indicate, if  indeed  there  has  been  a
      significant  deterioration,  that  the  local  authority  and   social
      services would not honour  their  legal  obligations  to  provide  the
      appropriate assistance and support to MR. MR does  not  live  with  NT
      suggesting that she does have a degree of  independence.  Even  if  MR
      does require a higher level of care then I have  found,  this  can  be
      provided by NT. There is nothing preventing MR from moving back to her
      daughter's home, as she did previously. Even if NT has to give up  her
      employment in order to provide her mother with additional  assistance,
      this would not render the impact on NT unduly harsh in  light  of  the
      appellant's very serious offending and  the  strength  of  the  public
      interest in his deportation.


  39. In light  of  the  above  assessment,  including  the  various  public
      interests identified, the seriousness of  the  appellant's  offending,
      the  appellant's  rehabilitation,  the  respondent's  delay,  and  the
      possibility of NT  being  unable  to  continue  her  studies  or  find
      employment, I am not satisfied that  the  effect  of  the  appellant's
      deportation on NT would be unduly harsh.


  40. I must now consider whether the effect of the appellant's  deportation
      on his 3 daughters would be unduly harsh. I will again concentrate  on
      the question whether it would be unduly  harsh  for  the  children  to
      remain in the UK without the appellant. In making my assessment I have
      again considered the various public interest factors described  above,
      the public interest factors in s.117B and 117C of the  2002  Act,  the
      evidence of the steps taken by the appellant to rehabilitate  himself,
      his low risk of re-offending and low risk of harm to the  public,  and
      the respondent's delay in making a deportation decision.


  41. I have accepted that the appellant has a strong parental  relationship
      with all 3 daughters, that he is the primary carer of N and A as their
      mother is studying full-time, and that it is in best interests of  all
      his children for him to remain in the  UK.  I  remind  myself  however
      that, although a primary consideration,  the  best  interests  of  the
      children is not a paramount consideration and  may  be  outweighed  by
      very   strong   countervailing   public   interest   factors   in    a
      proportionality assessment.


  42. I have carefully considered the ISW report. I accept that Ms Brown  is
      suitably qualified and experienced to provide an expert opinion on the
      effect on the children of the appellant's deportation. Her report  was
      based on documents provided to her including draft witness statements,
      the respondent's refusal  of  the  asylum  and  human  rights  claims,
      various medical letters relating to MR, school letters  and  a  single
      interview with the appellant, NT and their children. In section  3  of
      her report  Ms  Brown  extensively  sets  out  the  family  chronology
      including  the  appellant's  immigration  and  criminal  history,  the
      history of his relationship with NT, and  his  relationship  with  his
      daughters.  At  3.15  Ms  Brown  notes  that  the  appellant  had   no
      significant contact with K during her early life. At the time the  ISW
      report was prepared the appellant was having  weekly  contact  with  K
      although she often spent her weekends at  her  maternal  grandmother's
      home where she saw other family members. K spent little  time  at  the
      home the appellant shared with  NT,  N  and  A.  Ms  Brown  notes  the
      stresses that NT feared including the  prospect  of  becoming  a  lone
      parent and the need to care for her mother, and, at 3.29,  notes  NT's
      account of having many friends and family members  in  the  Birmingham
      area. Ms Brown records the concerns of NT and the appellant in respect
      of the impact his deportation would have on his daughters.


  43. In section 4, headed  'current  circumstances',  Ms  Brown  notes  the
      appellant's proactivity caring for his daughters since his release and
      his diligence in rebuilding and re-establishing his relationship  with
      K. Ms Brown stated that K, at 6 years of age, would be  too  young  to
      understand why her father  had  once  again  gone  from  her  life  if
      deported  and  that  a  2nd  loss  may   prove   irreparable.   Whilst
      acknowledging  Ms  Brown's  expertise  I  find  this   conclusion   is
      speculative. K is now 7 years old. There appears to be no  reason  why
      the appellant's deportation could not be explained to K in terms which
      she would understand and which would not necessarily generate a  sense
      of abandonment. Any possible severance of the  relationship  must,  in
      any event, be balanced against the various strong public interests  in
      the removal of individuals who have received long custodial  sentences
      for drugs offences.


  44.  At  4.3  Ms  Brown  states  that  remote  or  electronic   means   of
      communication are  not  sufficient  or  tangible  and  cannot  provide
      comfort to a child who needs the physical  and  palpable  presence  of
      their parent or carer. At 4.9 Ms Brown states, with reference  to  her
      professional  experience  of  children  visiting  parents   in   other
      countries, that this "... can be devastating for children", and refers
      to a recent case where the children were in despair  having  travelled
      to the country to see their father in the belief and  hope  that  they
      were to bring him home. I accept that a relationship conducted through
      remote methods of communication can never compare to a relationship of
      close physical proximity. This is clearly  to  the  detriment  of  the
      appellant's children, and a weighty factor in determining whether  the
      impact of the deportation  is  unduly  harsh.  There  was  however  no
      suggestion or  evidence  that  communication  would  be  severed.  The
      appellant would be able to maintain contact with his children  through
      telephone calls,  Internet  based  communication,  and  letters,  and,
      perhaps in the future  when  finances  permit,  visits.  I  accept  Ms
      Brown's professional view that family visits  to  a  parent  "can"  be
      devastating, but this will depend on the particular  circumstances  of
      the visit. The only example she cites is of children who visited their
      father in the belief that they would be  bringing  him  home.  If  the
      appellant's children were to visit him in the future their mothers can
      be reasonably expected to inform them that it is purely  for  a  visit
      and that their father will not be coming home with them.


  45. At 4.16 Ms Brown states that the appellant's  deportation  would  "...
      have a devastating impact upon [NT], the children concerned  and  also
      other parties, including [MR], who  may  have  to  become  reliant  on
      other, less reliable and inconsistent sources of support." At  5.6  Ms
      Brown states that the appellant's absence would have "... far-reaching
      effects on the children, depriving them  of  the  stability  of  [sic]
      parental relationship they enjoy with him as well as the stability  of
      the family unit as a whole." I have already dealt at some length  with
      the position of MR. Whilst I accept that the  appellant  does  provide
      some assistance to his mother-in-law, and that he has  a  relationship
      with her as the mother of his partner, their relationship is  not  one
      that contains any significant elements of reliance or  dependence  and
      is one that can be maintained through remote forms  of  communication.
      Whilst there will clearly be a detrimental effect on  the  appellant's
      relationship with NT and with his children Ms Brown does  not  provide
      any further detail or particularisation in respect of the "devastating
      impact", or the nature of the 'far-reaching effects on the  children'.
      Neither NT nor the appellant's children have any  mental  or  physical
      health issues making them particularly vulnerable to  separation  from
      the appellant. They will not be rendered destitute in the event of the
      appellant's deportation. The children will continue to live with their
      mothers who will continue to ensure their welfare and safety. From 4.7
      to 4.2, and then in section 5, Ms Brown notes that the  appellant  and
      his partner have done much to create  a  stable  environment  and  she
      refers to a  number  of  studies  relating  to  child  and  adolescent
      development. I have considered the extracts provided and  accept  that
      the loss of a physically  close  relationship  is  likely  to  have  a
      negative effect on the children's  development  emotionally,  socially
      and psychologically. This negative effect is however expressed in only
      general terms and there is no indication of the degree of  the  impact
      on these particular children.

  46. Ms Brown notes that the appellant was  "unsure"  whether  or  not  his
      daughters would continue to see  one  another  if  he  was  no  longer
      involved in their lives. In his oral evidence  the  appellant  claimed
      his father worked hard with an importation business and did  not  seem
      to be a person who would take  his  grandchildren.  I  note  that  the
      appellant's father, HE, gave evidence on his behalf at the  First-tier
      Tribunal hearing. In his statement dated 19 November 2015 HE indicates
      that he lives 4 miles or so from the appellant and that  he  sees  the
      appellant and his  family  very  frequently,  sometimes  everyday  but
      mostly every other day. He drops by the house and spends time with the
      appellant  and  his  daughters  and  partner.  He  sees  all  of   his
      grandchildren very often and treats them to ice cream and  takes  them
      to playgrounds and parks. He sees K with the appellant about  2  or  3
      times a week, either at her house or on the street when she comes back
      from school. He and the appellant often take K to a games arcade. When
      the appellant was in prison HE took K to see him.


  47. HE did not give evidence at the Upper Tribunal hearing. No explanation
      was offered for his failure to do so (and I do not  draw  any  adverse
      inference from the  absence  of  oral  evidence),  but  there  was  no
      suggestion that there had been a falling out within the  appellant  or
      the appellant's  family.  There  was  no  evidence  from  any  of  the
      witnesses to suggest that HE's  father  circumstances  had  materially
      changed. HE's statement was not formally withdrawn. When asked whether
      there was any reason why the appellant's family could  not  facilitate
      interaction between the 3 children NT answered, "No, I don't  know  of
      any reason why." If there  had  been  a  material  alteration  in  the
      relationship between the appellant's father and  his  grandchildren  I
      would have reasonably expected NT to have made mention of this in  her
      evidence. I consequently fins that HE remains, in accordance with  his
      statement, a frequent visitor  to  the  appellant's  family  home  and
      someone who has direct knowledge of and involvement  with  K.  In  the
      absence  of  anything  to  indicate  any  material   change   in   the
      circumstances of the appellant's  father  I  find  that  he  would  be
      capable of facilitating  communication  and  interaction  between  the
      appellant's 3 daughters.


  48. Even if I were to find that none of the appellant's family members are
      able or willing to facilitate interaction between his 3 daughters, and
      that neither NT nor KJ have any family members who are similarly  able
      to assist, it is a question of choice that prevents the children  from
      playing together. Whilst I can appreciate why NT would wish to have no
      involvement with KJ, it is her decision that prevents her 2  daughters
      from interacting with K. If she chooses to allow  the  3  children  to
      play together then the  relationship  between  the  half-siblings  can
      continue. The fact that NT chooses not to allow her daughters to  play
      with K in the appellant's absence, even with minimal interaction  with
      KJ, is a relevant factor in determining  whether  the  impact  on  the
      children would be 'unduly harsh', and in determining the existence  of
      very compelling circumstances. Whilst the children cannot in  any  way
      be blamed for their parents' intransigence  the  reality  is  that  it
      would be NT's choice that the half-siblings do not  interact.  I  find
      that it is not necessary for the appellant to be present in the United
      Kingdom in order for his 3 children to interact.

  49. Even if I am wrong in the above assessment, and  NT  avowedly  chooses
      not to facilitate interaction between her 2 daughters and K, I have to
      consider whether this would amount to an unduly harsh  impact  on  the
      children in light of the serious nature of the  appellant's  offending
      and the strong public interest in his  deportation.  Whilst  it  would
      clearly be in the children's best  interests  to  interact  with  each
      other, and the absence of any  such  interaction  may  jeopardise  the
      continued or future relationships between them, all  of  the  children
      are in good health, and there is little to indicate that  depriving  K
      of the opportunity to see her half-sisters would have  any  particular
      impact on her welfare, her well-being and health, or on that of N  and
      A.

  50. In NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2016]
      EWCA Civ 662, Lord Justice Jackson stated, at [33] and [34],


         Although there is no 'exceptionality' requirement,  it  inexorably
         follows  from  the  statutory  scheme  that  the  cases  in  which
         circumstances are sufficiently compelling  to  outweigh  the  high
         public interest in  deportation  will  be  rare.  The  commonplace
         incidents of family life, such as ageing parents in poor health or
         the natural  love  between  parents  and  children,  will  not  be
         sufficient.

         The best interests of children certainly carry  great  weight,  as
         identified by Lord Kerr in HH v Deputy Prosecutor of  the  Italian
         Republic [2012] UKSC 25; [2013] 1 AC 338 at  [145].  Nevertheless,
         it is a consequence of criminal  conduct  that  offenders  may  be
         separated from their children for many years, contrary to the best
         interests of those children. The desirability  of  children  being
         with both parents is a commonplace of family  life.  That  is  not
         usually a sufficiently compelling  circumstance  to  outweigh  the
         high public interest in deporting foreign criminals.  As  Rafferty
         LJ observed in Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v  CT
         (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 488 at [38]:

             "Neither the British nationality of the respondent's  children
             nor their likely separation from their father for a long  time
             are  exceptional  circumstances  which  outweigh  the   public
             interest in his deportation."



    51. In Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  v  AJ  (Zimbabwe)
        [2016] EWCA Civ 1012, having  reviewed  case  law  considering  the
        impact on children following deportation  decisions,  Lord  Justice
        Elias stated, at [17]



         These cases show that it will be rare for the  best  interests  of
         the children to outweigh the strong public interest  in  deporting
         foreign criminals. Something more than a lengthy separation from a
         parent is required, even though such separation is detrimental  to
         the child's best interests.


  52. The Court of Appeal explained that, whilst it will virtually always be
      in the best interests of the child for the  parental  relationship  to
      continue, there must be some additional feature or features  affecting
      the nature or quality of the relationship which take the case  out  of
      the  ordinary.  Having  regard  to   the   evidence   concerning   the
      relationship between the appellant and his children, and the  evidence
      relating to the relationships between the  half-siblings,  and  having
      carefully  considered  the  ISW  report  and  the  evidence   of   the
      appellant's rehabilitation, and noting the respondent's  delay,  I  am
      not satisfied there are any additional features affecting  the  nature
      or quality of the relationships  in  the  factual  matrix  before  me.
      Having considered all the  factors  that  weight  in  the  appellant's
      favour, and balancing those against the strong public interest factors
      that I have already identified, including the nature  and  seriousness
      of  the  appellant's  offending,  I  find  that  the  impact  on   the
      appellant's children would not be unduly harsh.


  53. Having found that the effect of the appellant's deportation would  not
      be unduly harsh on either his partner or his children, a  fortiori,  I
      find that there are no very compelling circumstances  over  and  above
      such an effect.


  54. Mr Moriarty submitted that there  were  significant  analogies  to  be
      drawn between the facts of KD (Jamaica) v Secretary of State  for  the
      Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ  418  and  the  present  appeal  (both
      appellants  received  sentences  of  over  4  years  for  drug-related
      offences, both had ceased taking drugs for over 5 years  and  achieved
      full rehabilitation, both played significant roles in their children's
      lives, both  had  experienced  delays  by  the  respondent  in  making
      deportation decisions, and that it was in the best  interests  of  the
      children, whose behaviour deteriorated in their father's  absence,  to
      have their father remain),and that  I  should  follow  this  decision.
      Whilst the Tribunal  in  KD  was  rationally  entitled  to  reach  its
      conclusion   that   the   deportation   of    that    appellant    was
      disproportionate, I am not bound by its conclusions, either by way  of
      analogy or otherwise. Two different  decision  makers  may  rationally
      reach two different decisions on the same or  similar  facts.  In  any
      event, I am not satisfied that the facts are  sufficiently  analogous.
      Mr Dennis, the appellant in KD, received a  slightly  lesser  sentence
      (one of 5 years) and his history of offending was not  as  serious  as
      that of the present appellant, and the  appeal  was  decided  under  a
      version of the immigration rules that did not require the existence of
      an 'unduly harsh' effect and was decided in the absence of the greater
      specificity attaching to public interest factors identified in  s.117B
      to 117C of the 2002 Act. In these circumstances  I  do  not  find  the
      decision in KD to be sufficiently relevant to my decision.
