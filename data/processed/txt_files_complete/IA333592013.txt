For the Appellant:           Mr Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:     -


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Turkey  date  of  birth  31st  December
    1945. On the 22nd January 2014 the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Powell)
    allowed his appeal against a decision to remove  him  from  the  United
    Kingdom pursuant to section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act  1999.
    The Secretary of State  now  has  permission  to  appeal  against  that
    decision.


 2. The Respondent had come to the UK as a visitor.  On  the  13th  October
    2011, long after his visit visa had expired, he made an application for
    leave to remain on human rights grounds. It was submitted that  he  met
    all of the substantive requirements of the then paragraph  317  of  the
    Immigration   Rules   and   that   it   would   be   unreasonable   and
    disproportionate to return him to Turkey in all of the circumstances.

 3. The Secretary  of  State  considered  the  medical  evidence  presented
    relating to the Respondent's ill health but  did  not  find  the  facts
    disclosed a risk of violation of Article 3 ECHR. Turning to  Article  8
    the Secretary of State referred to the new rules, to  MF  (Nigeria)[1],
    Izuazu[2] and Nagre[3] and rejected the claim under that head as well.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal notes, at paragraph  18  of  the  determination
    that it "was common ground" that this application  was  concerned  with
    Article 8 outside of the Rules. Between paragraphs 21 and 41 the First-
    tier Tribunal conducts a careful assessment of Article 8,  including  a
    well-reasoned  proportionality  balancing  exercise  which  takes  into
    account material factors weighing against the then Appellant.    Having
    done so Judge Powell allowed the appeal.

 5. The Secretary of State now seeks to appeal against that  decision  with
    reference to Gulshan[4]. It is submitted that the new rules  provide  a
    complete code for the assessment of Article 8 and since the application
    failed under these Rules the First-tier Tribunal could only  go  on  to
    look at Article 8 outwith the Rules if there were good grounds to  find
    that there were compelling circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised
    under the Rules.

 6. These grounds of appeal are misconceived.  This  application  was  made
    long before  the  new  rules  came  into  effect.  The  point  made  on
    application was that the Respondent met  all  of  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 317 of the then Immigration Rules bar the requirement that he
    had leave to enter in that capacity.  This was then a matter  analogous
    with that considered in Chikwamba and related cases[5].  The First-tier
    Tribunal was in these circumstances under no obligation to consider the
    matter under the two-stage process advocated in MF and other cases, nor
    to address itself to whether there were particular compelling  features
    that warranted conducting a  Razgar  assessment:   Edgehill  &  Anor  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 402. I  find
    that the First-tier Tribunal did exactly what was required  of  it  and
    the decision discloses no error of law.

      Decision

 7. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error
    of law and the decision is upheld.
