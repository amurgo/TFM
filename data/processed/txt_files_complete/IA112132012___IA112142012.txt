Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery (1 March 2013) and Ms A Fijiwala (28
April 2015)
For the Claimants:     Mr Colin Yeo, Counsel (1 March 2013)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals from  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  allowing  the  appeal  of  the  first  claimant  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision to refuse to vary his leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 Migrant.  The  second  claimant  is  her
    husband, and joined in the appeal as her dependant.  His appeal against
    the refusal of further leave to remain was allowed in line with that of
    the first claimant.  For ease of reference I shall hereafter  refer  to
    the first claimant as simply  the  claimant,  save  where  the  context
    otherwise requires.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make an  anonymity
    direction, and I do not consider that the claimants should be  accorded
    anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. On 28 April 2012 the Secretary of State gave her reasons  for  refusing
    the claimant's application for leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post-Study
    Work) Migrant under the points-based  system.   She  had  been  granted
    leave to enter the United Kingdom as a Tier 4  Migrant  on  20  October
    2009, and her leave in that capacity expired on 30 January  2012.   Her
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 1  Migrant  was  made  on  28
    January 2012.  With regard to Appendix C, she provided  joint  evidence
    of available funds intending to over the maintenance funds  requirement
    for herself and her dependent partner.  The documents she provided  did
    not demonstrate that she had been in possession  of  �1,333  (�800  for
    herself and �533 for her dependant), for the period  specified  in  the
    guidance.

 3. She had to show that she had been in possession of at least  �1,333  of
    available funds for a consecutive 90 day period ending no more than one
    calendar month before the date of  her  application.   As  evidence  of
    this, she provided a bank statement for a Barclays Bank savings account
    showing balances from 15 September 2011 until  24  January  2012,  bank
    statements for a Barclays Bank cash card account from 23 November  2011
    until 16 January 2012, and a bank statement for  her  husband's  Lloyds
    TSB account showing balances from 29 November  2011  until  19  January
    2012.

 4. UKBA had assessed  the  maintenance  requirement  from  the  period  27
    October 2011 to 24 January 2012.  However, from 27 October 2011  to  23
    November 2011, the level of available funds fell below �1,333.  So they
    were unable to award points for maintenance, in line with the published
    guidance and the Immigration Rules.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The claimants' appeals came before Judge  Davidson  sitting  at  Taylor
    House on 2 June 2012.   Both  parties  were  legally  represented.   At
    paragraph 5 of his subsequent determination,  Judge  Davidson  directed
    himself  that  the  appeal  was  governed  by  Section  85(4)  of   the
    Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   Accordingly,   the
    Tribunal could consider evidence about  any  matter  which  it  thought
    relevant to the substance of the  decision,  including  evidence  which
    concerned a matter arising after the date of the decision.   The  judge
    continued: "I may therefore consider evidence about any matter which  I
    consider relevant to the substance of the decision."

 6. Later, at paragraph 15, he said that as this was an in country  appeal,
    he had the authority to consider the situation appertaining at the date
    of the hearing, as opposed to that at the date of the decision.

 7. The claimant gave oral evidence that they provided their solicitor with
    all their bank statements  and  the  solicitor  had  assured  them  the
    amounts in their Barclays accounts would be sufficient,  together  with
    the sums in the husband's Lloyds Bank account: "They  claim  that  they
    gave the relevant evidence of funds to the solicitor but the  solicitor
    did not seem to submit it to the respondent."

 8. At paragraph 20  the  judge  pronounced  himself  satisfied  that  both
    claimants were honest witnesses.  At paragraph 23 he held as follows:

         "So far as funds are concerned the [claimants] claim that they  had
         the required funds and gave the evidence of those  funds  to  their
         representative who must have failed to pass it  on.   I  have  seen
         copies of the [claimants'] bank statements covering the relevant 90
         days from 27.10.2011 until 19.1.2012, and  it  is  clear  that  the
         [claimants]  had  considerably  more  than   the   minimum   �1,333
         throughout this period.  I therefore find that they  satisfied  the
         requirements for maintenance (funds) under  Appendix  C  and  allow
         this appeal accordingly."

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 9. On 13 August 2012 Jamela Hussain of the Specialist Appeals Team settled
    an application for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   She
    argued that the appeal  was  allowed  solely  on  the  basis  of  fresh
    evidence, namely the evidence that was handed in after the Secretary of
    State had made the decision  to  refuse  the  application.   The  judge
    should not have had regard to that evidence.  Section 85(4) of the 2002
    Act allowed a Tribunal to consider any evidence it considered  relevant
    to the substance of the decision subject to the constraints imposed  by
    Sections 85(5) and 85A.  Section 85A(4)(a) specified the  Tribunal  may
    only consider evidence relating to the acquisition  of  points  in  PBS
    cases which was submitted in support of, at the  time  of  making,  the
    application to which the immigration decision relates.  In  this  case,
    the judge had considered evidence (bank  statements)  that  was  served
    after the date of the refusal decision.  In fact  they  had  only  ever
    been produced at the hearing.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

10. On 3 September 2012 Judge Robertson granted permission  to  appeal  for
    the following reasons:

         "The only issue in this appeal is whether the judge considered post-
         decision  evidence  in  relation  to  the  maintenance  requirement
         contrary to Sections 85(5) and 85A of the Nationality,  Immigration
         and Asylum Act 2002.  The judge found that evidence  of  funds  had
         been provided [to] the appellants' solicitors but  the  latter  had
         not  forwarded  this  to  the  respondent  (paragraph   23).    The
         respondent submits that there was no evidence of  this  before  her
         until the date of hearing.  This is an arguable error of law."

The Error of Law Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

11. At the hearing before me, Mr Yeo, who did not  appear  below,  conceded
    that the claimants had not complied with the relevant Immigration Rules
    relating to the maintenance requirement.  They  had  not  provided  the
    bank statement evidence before the refusal decision which  showed  that
    they had available funds of at least �1,333 throughout  a  relevant  90
    day period.

12. However, he submitted that the judge had not materially  erred  in  law
    taking into account the evidence which  had  been  provided  after  the
    decision.   Alternatively,  the  decision  should  be  remade  in   the
    appellant's favour, in the  light  of  Rodriguez  (flexibility  policy)
    [2013] UKUT 0042, a decision of the Upper Tribunal  promulgated  on  31
    January 2013.  The head note of Rodriguez reads inter alia as follows:

         "Since August 2009 UKBA has  operated  a  policy  relating  to  the
         processing and determination of applications under the points-based
         system ('PBS').  This was revised with effect from  May  2011.   In
         its policy letter of 19  May  2011,  UKBA  states  that  during  an
         unspecified  trial  stage  applicants  will  be   contacted   where
         mandatory evidence is missing from their applications and given the
         opportunity to provide this.  UKBA is under a public  law  duty  to
         give effect to this policy in all cases to which it applies."

13. Mr Avery submitted that Rodriguez was distinguishable from the  present
    case on the  facts.   Unlike  in  Rodriguez,  the  claimants  here  had
    provided  the  mandatory  evidence.   They  provided  bank   statements
    covering  a  90  day  period.   So  the  caseworker  dealing  with  the
    application would not have had sufficient reason to believe  that  some
    bank statements were missing.

14. In reply, Mr Yeo pointed out that the two perceived deficiencies in the
    financial information supplied by Ms Rodriguez were:

          a) the bank statements spanned a period of  seventeen  day  only,
             rather than 28 days.

          b) Whereas the statements disclosed a  credit  balance  exceeding
             �1,200 for most of this period, the balance  fell  to  �903.74
             during four days, from 20 to 23 January 2012.

15. Mr Yeo also drew my  attention  to  the  conclusion  of  the  panel  in
    Rodriguez at paragraph 12:

         "It [the UKBA letter of 19 May 2011]  also  heralded  unequivocally
         the introduction of a new practice whereby all applicants would  be
         notified  of  the  absence  of  mandatory   evidence   from   their
         applications and would be given  the  opportunity  to  rectify  the
         relevant shortcoming prior  to  rejection  ...  we  consider  that,
         properly construed  and  evaluated  in  its  entirety,  the  policy
         enunciated in the letter required  the  Respondent  to  notify  the
         Appellant of the informational shortcomings in her application  and
         to afford her the opportunity of rectification and  addition  prior
         to an adverse determination.  It is conceded  that  the  Respondent
         failed to do so."

Reasons for finding an Error of Law

16. One issue which is not contentious is that the refusal letter contained
    a Section 47 removal notice, which  is  unlawful.   As  Judge  Davidson
    allowed the appeal against the refusal of leave to remain, it  was  not
    necessary for him to address the legality of  the  concomitant  removal
    decision under Section 47.  But since his decision on  the  refusal  of
    variation of leave is under challenge,  the  legality  of  the  removal
    direction comes into focus.  As is illuminated in Adamally, the Section
    47 removal notice was not in accordance with the law, and I so declare.
     It does not matter that this point was not  taken  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

17. Turning to the appeal against the refusal of leave to remain, I  am  in
    no doubt that Judge Davidson erred in law in taking into  account  bank
    statement evidence that had not been provided to the Secretary of State
    in advance of the refusal decision.  He was  bound  to  disregard  such
    evidence by statute.   This  is  affirmed  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Rodriguez, at paragraph 6:

         "While the judge does not indicate whether the new  evidence  would
         be admitted - and, thus, considered by  the  Tribunal  -  it  would
         appear that, by implication, it was excluded.  We consider that  it
         had to be disregarded, by virtue of Section 85A of the 2002 Act."

18. I turn to consider whether  the  claimants'  position  is  salvaged  by
    Rodriguez.  I accept that the  policy  discussed  by  the  Tribunal  in
    Rodriguez  is  sufficiently  wide  in  its  ambit  to   encompass   the
    informational deficiency in the claimants' application, albeit that the
    claimants had provided bank statements for an entire 90 day period, and
    so there were no bank statements missing  in  a  simplistic  sense.   I
    accept Mr Yeo's submission that it was possible for the  caseworker  to
    deduce from the bank statements which had been provided that the Lloyds
    TSB account and the cash card account had not  just  been  opened,  and
    therefore there was a very real possibility that either of  them  would
    show sufficient funds in the previous  month.   The  one  set  of  bank
    statements covering the entire 90 day period showed  a  credit  balance
    consistently in excess of �1,000, and therefore there did not  need  to
    be a significant credit balance in either of the other two accounts  in
    the preceding month for the threshold of �1,333 to be reached.

19. On the other hand, my attention has not been drawn to the existence  of
    a letter such as that received by the appellant in Rodriguez,  whereby,
    following  submission  of  her  completed  application,  the  appellant
    received a letter from the respondent indicating  that  the  caseworker
    would write to her as soon as possible if there was  any  problem  with
    the  validity  of  the  application,  such  as  missing  documentation.
    Furthermore, given the implicit finding of negligence on  the  part  of
    the claimant's  solicitor  (who  had  apparently  been  given  all  the
    necessary bank statements, but had inexplicably failed to pass some  of
    them on to UKBA) there is a real issue as to whether such  notification
    would have been acted upon.  Put another way, on a holistic  assessment
    it is reasonable to question whether the claimants can be  said  to  be
    the victims of unfair treatment at the hands of UKBA  rather  than  the
    victims of negligence by their solicitor.

20. A further distinction between this case and that of Rodriguez  is  that
    in Rodriguez it was argued before the First-tier Tribunal that UKBA had
    operated  in  breach  of  the  Policy  of  Evidential  Flexibility   in
    considering the PBS  application:  and  either  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or at the hearing in the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State
    made factual concessions about the appellant's individual circumstances
    which the Upper Tribunal relied on in coming to the conclusion that she
    was entitled to relief.

21. In contrast, the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  here  was  not  asked  to
    address the question of an alleged breach of the Policy  of  Evidential
    Flexibility, and it has been raised for the  first  time  at,  and  not
    before, the error of law hearing in the Upper Tribunal.

22. In all the circumstances, I consider that the appropriate course is not
    to make a ruling on the issue, but  to  adjourn  the  remaking  of  the
    decision to a resumed hearing at  which  both  parties  will  have  the
    opportunity to put in further evidence on the Rodriguez question.

Directions for Resumed Hearing

23. The burden of proof rests  with  the  claimant  to  show  that  she  is
    entitled to relief for breach of the Policy of Evidential  Flexibility.
    The evidence which will assist me  in  deciding  whether  the  decision
    should be remade in her favour on this ground is as follows:

          a) All correspondence passing between  the  claimant's  solicitor
             and UKBA concerning the application;

          b) Clarification on which bank statements were handed over to the
             solicitor, and which bank statements were not passed on by the
             solicitor to UKBA;

          c)  Evidence  about  the  applicability  of  the  Policy  to  the
             application (beyond that contained in Rodriguez itself)

          d) Why  (if  this  be  the  case)  the  caseworker  handling  the
             application did not ask the claimant/her solicitor  to  supply
             additional bank statements for the period in respect of  which
             only one bank statement had been provided?

24. I appreciate that only the Secretary of State can put  in  evidence  on
    the last point, but the claimant can put in evidence on points (a)  and
    (b); and she may be able to put in evidence on point (c).

25. I direct that the resumed hearing before  me  to  remake  the  decision
    shall not take place before 26 March 2013. Not less than 7 days  before
    the resumed hearing the parties shall serve upon the Upper Tribunal and
    upon each other a paginated and indexed bundle  of  all  the  documents
    upon which they propose to  rely  for  the  purposes  of  remaking  the
    decision. My time estimate is 1 hour.

The Resumed Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

26. There was a two year delay in this case  coming  back  to  me  for  the
    resumed hearing.  The  claimants  attended  in  person,  without  legal
    representation.

27. For the purposes of remaking the decision,  I  received  oral  evidence
    from the claimants,  who  tendered  a  joint  witness  statement  which
    addressed the first and second directions made by me  for  the  resumed
    hearing.

28. The solicitors who had hitherto had the conduct of their appeal in  the
    Upper Tribunal were Lawrence  Lupin  Solicitors,  and  they  showed  me
    correspondence between Lawrence Lupin  Solicitors  and  their  previous
    solicitors  in  which  Lawrence  Lupin  Solicitors  had  requested  the
    respondent's file, and in particular all correspondence passing between
    the firm and UKBA concerning the claimants' application.  As  of  March
    2013 the position taken by the previous firm  of  solicitors  was  that
    they did not have any documents, and all  the  documents  were  in  the
    possession of the second claimant.  Following the error of law  hearing
    and my directions, Lawrence Lupin Solicitors made  another  attempt  to
    obtain documents from the previous firm.  The initial response was that
    the caseworker concerned was away on holiday, but he/she would  get  in
    touch when he/she returned.  It does not appear that this happened,  as
    Lawrence  Lupin  Solicitors  sent   a   number   of   chasing   letters
    subsequently.  The second claimant informed me  that  he  had  recently
    gone round the premises from which the firm used to  operate,  and  the
    firm was not there.  So, as far as  he  was  concerned,  the  firm  had
    closed down.

29. However he was able to assist on the question of which bank  statements
    were handed over to the previous firm of solicitors.   In  addition  to
    those contained in section G of the Home Office bundle, he said that he
    had provided Lloyds TSB current account statements for  the  period  17
    September 2011 to 9 November 2011; Lloyds TSB bank statements  for  the
    period 9 November to  29  November;  and  a  Barclays  current  account
    statement for the period 22 October 2011 to 22 November 2011.

30. I noted that the bundle of documents relied on  by  him  and  his  wife
    before the First-tier Tribunal only included two of the three "missing"
    sets of bank statements.  What was missing from the appellants'  bundle
    was a set of Lloyds TSB statements covering the period 9 November to 29
    November 2011.

31. In the signed joint witness statement, the claimants  said  they  could
    not confirm which bank statements were  sent  to  UKBA  as  they  never
    received confirmation from their solicitor or a cover letter to confirm
    the same.

32. In her submissions on behalf of the Secretary  of  State,  Ms  Fijiwala
    referred me to the PBS process instructions on  evidential  flexibility
    as of 18 May 2012.  The covering letter to the guidance says that it is
    the latest version of the evidential flexibility policy that was  first
    introduced on 10 August 2009.  She also referred me to Rodriguez [2014]
    EWCA Civ 2.  She submitted  that  on  the  evidence  available  to  the
    caseworker  it  was  reasonable  for  the  caseworker  not  to  request
    additional  information  or  documents  from  the  claimants   on   the
    maintenance requirement.

33. In reply, the second claimant said that they had been badly let down by
    the previous firm of solicitors.  The consequences for  them  are  very
    harsh, as his wife was a genuine student.  Moreover, she  had  recently
    given birth to their child, and their home in Nepal had been  destroyed
    by the recent earthquake.

Discussion and Findings on the Evidential Flexibility Argument

34. It is  not  shown  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  any  bank
    statements were provided to the Home Office beyond those  contained  in
    section G of the Home Office bundle.  Thus, on the  evidence  available
    to the caseworker assessing the application, between 27 October and  23
    November  2011,  the  level  of  available  funds  fell  below  �1,333.
    Accordingly, the caseworker was prima facie right not to  award  points
    for maintenance.

35. The question which arises is whether the caseworker should  have  asked
    the claimants' solicitors to provide additional evidence before  making
    a decision on the application.

36. The introduction to the latest version of the policy guidance as of May
    2012 states as follows: "However, requests for information  should  not
    be speculative, we must have sufficient  reason  to  believe  that  any
    evidence requested exists."

37. Step three of the procedure on  evidential  flexibility  instructs  the
    caseworker that he should only go out  for  additional  information  in
    certain  circumstances  which  would  lead  to  the  approval  of   the
    application: "Before  you  go  out  to  the  applicant  you  must  have
    established that evidence exists, or have sufficient reason to  believe
    the information exists."

38. The non-exhaustive list of examples includes "bank  statements  missing
    from a series".

39. The bank statements in section G of the Home Office bundle purported to
    cover a 90-day period.  The first claimant's  monthly  savings  account
    with Barclays ran from 15  September  2011  to  9  January  2012.   The
    statement for the second claimant's current  account  with  Lloyds  TSB
    Bank ran from 29 November  2011  to  19  January  2012.   Finally,  two
    statements had been provided for the first claimant's cash card account
    with Barclays.  The first covered the period 23 November to 22 December
    2011, and the second covered the period 23 December 2011 to 16  January
    2012.

40. It would have been apparent to the caseworker that  the  claimants  had
    the assistance of a firm of solicitors in making their application, and
    it also would have been apparent to the caseworker  that  a  mosaic  of
    overlapping  bank  statements  had  been  provided  which  covered  the
    required 90-day period.  In the circumstances, I do not  consider  that
    the caseworker should have  suspected  that  there  were  missing  bank
    statements.  There  was  no  reason  to  suppose  that  the  mosaic  of
    overlapping bank statements was incomplete  and/or  that  one  or  more
    further statements in respect of one or more of the accounts  had  been
    accidentally omitted.  It would have been speculation on  the  part  of
    the caseworker to consider whether or not the claimants might have  had
    other funds elsewhere.   The  caseworker  was  not  to  know  that  the
    claimants had such funds, or that  a  mistake  had  been  made  in  the
    application by the failure to provide a more  comprehensive  mosaic  of
    overlapping bank statements in  respect  of  the  three  bank  accounts
    operated by the claimants.   Accordingly,  I  find  that  the  decision
    appealed against is in accordance with the law, and there was no breach
    of evidential  flexibility  in  the  caseworker  failing  to  give  the
    claimants the opportunity to remedy the defect in their application.

41. As I explained to the second claimant  at  the  hearing,  the  negative
    outcome of this appeal does not prevent his wife from making a  renewed
    application for leave to remain as a student, or from  them  making  an
    application  for  leave  to  remain  on  the   basis   of   exceptional
    circumstances having regard  to  the  impact  on  them  of  the  recent
    earthquake in Nepal.  I explained that provided any such application is
    made within  28  days  of  their  appeal  rights  being  deemed  to  be
    exhausted, they will not be treated as overstayers.

Conclusion

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted:

The claimants' appeal against the decision  to  refuse  the  first  claimant
leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
