For the Respondent:    Mr M. Saleen, Counsel instructed by Malik & Malk
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The respondent is a citizen of Algeria born on 25 March 1970.


   2. On 29 December 2014 the respondent applied for a residence card as
      confirmation of a right to reside in the UK as an extended family
      member on the basis of being in a durable relationship with an EEA
      national. On 28 August 2015, the application was refused as the
      Secretary of State (the appellant in this appeal) did not accept that
      he was in a durable relationship.


   3.  The respondent appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and his appeal was
      heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert OBE. The judge found that
      the respondent and his partner were in a durable relationship and on
      that basis allowed the appeal.


   4. The grounds of appeal argue that the judge was not entitled to allow
      the appeal and should have referred the matter back to the Secretary
      of State to exercise discretion under Regulation 17(4) of the
      Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.


   5. For the reasons given by the Upper Tribunal in Sala (EFMs: Right of
      Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC) there is no statutory right of appeal
      against a decision of the Secretary of State not to grant a Residence
      Card to a person claiming to be an Extended Family Member.
      Accordingly, the respondent did not have a right of appeal against the
      decision to refuse him a residence card and the First-tier Tribunal
      did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The decision of the
      First-tier Tribunal cannot therefore stand.


   6. This finding is sufficient to dispose of the matter. However, for
      completeness, and in any event, I find that a further error arises
      from the judge allowing the appeal outright when whether or not to
      issue a residence card to an extended family member was at the
      Secretary of State's discretion under Regulation 17(4) of the
      Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. Where, as was the case here, the
      discretion has not been exercised, the most the judge could have done
      (if there had been jurisdiction) would have been to allow the appeal
      as not being in accordance with the law, leaving the matter of how to
      exercise that discretion to the Secretary of State.


Decision

A. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside as the Tribunal did
not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

B.  I remake the decision by dismissing the respondent's appeal as there is
no statutory right of appeal against the decision to refuse him a residence
card as an extended family member of an EEA national.
