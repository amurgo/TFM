For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Z Khan of Universal Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   (SSHD) against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Prior  allowing
   Mr Kurimineni's appeal, on  limited  grounds,  against  the  respondent's
   decision to refuse leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and
   to remove him from the United Kingdom by way of directions under  section
   47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

2. For the purposes of  this  decision,  I  shall  hereafter  refer  to  the
   Secretary of State as the respondent and Mr Kurimineni as the  appellant,
   reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before  the  First-
   tier Tribunal.

3. The appellant is a citizen of India  born  on  12  June  1983.  He  first
   entered the United Kingdom on 17 September 2007 with leave to enter as  a
   student until 31  January  2009  and  was  subsequently  granted  further
   periods of leave as a student, a Tier 4 General  Student  Migrant  and  a
   Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 11 January  2013.  On  11  January
   2013 he applied for further leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
   Migrant.

4. The appellant's application was refused  under  paragraph  244DD  of  the
   immigration rules  on  the  grounds  that  he  had  failed  to  meet  the
   requirements of paragraphs 245DD(b) and  245DD(d).  With  regard  to  the
   former, he was awarded zero points under Appendix A  (Attributes)  as  he
   had failed to show that he had access  to  the  required  funds.  He  had
   failed to provide a suitable bank letter confirming that he had access to
   third party funds; he had failed to provide any advertising or  marketing
   material to confirm his  business  activity;  and  the  contract  he  had
   supplied as evidence of trading activity lacked specified information and
   details. With regard to the latter, he  was  awarded  zero  points  under
   Appendix C as the documents he had provided did not demonstrate  that  he
   had been in possession of ï¿½900 for the period specified.

5. The appellant appealed  against  that  decision,  submitting  grounds  of
   appeal that addressed each issue. With regard to access  to  third  party
   funds, the business contract and the evidence of maintenance, he asserted
   that the Secretary of State ought to have written to him  requesting  the
   submission of documentation in the required format. With  regard  to  the
   advertising material, he asserted that he  had  submitted  such  evidence
   with his application and that the Secretary of State had failed  to  send
   him  a  respondent's  appeal  bundle.  He  asserted  further   that   the
   respondent's decision was unlawful as he had provided  all  the  required
   documents in support of his application. He submitted that  the  decision
   to remove him was in breach of his human rights.

6.  The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Prior  on
   3 January 2014. The judge recorded that no respondent's appeal bundle had
   been produced. He noted that the appellant had provided,  in  his  appeal
   bundle, a modified contract of services providing the  required  details,
   but he had no evidence before him of the previous version of the contract
   and thus no evidence to reject the appellant's claim to have  provided  a
   contract containing the  required  details  with  his  application.  With
   regard to the issue of  access  to  funds,  he  noted  that  the  defects
   referred to in the refusal letter had been remedied by the evidence since
   supplied by the appellant and he considered in any event that  subsequent
   amendments to paragraph 245AA(d) allowed for applications to  be  granted
   despite such failures. The judge also noted  that  by  the  time  of  the
   respondent's decision the appellant had provided a  bank  statement  from
   the State Bank of India as evidence of additional funds, to  address  the
   issue of maintenance. He then decided to remit the case to the respondent
   for reconsideration and concluded further that the section 47 removal was
   not in accordance with the law.

7. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by  the  respondent
   on the grounds that the judge had erred by considering that a request for
   the appeal  to  be  decided  on  the  papers  involved  the  respondent's
   agreement; that  there  had  been  procedural  unfairness  in  the  judge
   accepting assertions  made  by  the  appellant  in  the  absence  of  the
   respondent's appeal bundle; and  that  the  judge  had  given  inadequate
   reasons as to how the appellant satisfied the immigration rules.

8. Permission to appeal was granted on 3 February 2014, with the  additional
   observation that the judge's decision in regard to section 47 of the 2006
   Act was arguably wrong.

9. The appeal came before me on 5 February 2014.  Ms  Isherwood  advised  me
   that the appellant's business partner's appeal had been dismissed on  the
   same evidence and that an error of law hearing was due to take  place  on
   31 March 2014. I decided, however, that that did not prevent the issue of
   error of law being decided myself on the appellant's individual case.

10.  Ms Isherwood submitted that the  judge's  determination  was  confusing
   and that he appeared to have simply accepted,  on  the  appellant's  bare
   assertion, that documents had been before the  Secretary  of  State  when
   they in fact had not been. It was not  for  the  Secretary  of  State  to
   approach the appellant  for  missing  documents.  The  evidence  was  not
   available to show that the requirements of the rules  were  met  and  the
   judge ought to have dismissed the appeal.

11. Mr Khan submitted that the judge had not erred in  law  but  had  simply
   recognised that he did not have proper evidence from either party and had
   not made any decision under the immigration rules.

12. I advised the parties that, in my view, the judge had made an  error  of
   law such that his decision ought to be set aside.

13. The judge's findings, if any, are unclear. On the one  hand  he  appears
   to  have  accepted  the  appellant's   bare   assertions   that   certain
   documentation  in  the  required  format  had  been  supplied  with   the
   application contrary to the terms of the refusal letter. Yet on the other
   hand he appears to have accepted the inadequacy of  other  documentation,
   but to have wrongly applied the terms of paragraph 245AA(d) of the  rules
   and the principles in Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013]  UKUT  42  in
   the appellant's favour.  His  comments  at  paragraph  12  demonstrate  a
   misunderstanding of the terms of the  evidential  flexibility  policy  as
   clarified by the Court of Appeal in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
   Department v Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2 and as enshrined in the rules in
   paragraph 245AA(d).

14.  Furthermore  the  judge's  findings  at  paragraph  13,  in  regard  to
   documents supplied subsequent to the appellant's application but prior to
   the respondent's decision, appear to have  been  made  been  without  any
   reference to the principles in Secretary of State for the Home Department
   v Raju & Ors [2013] EWCA  Civ  754.  Mr  Khan  sought  to  justify  those
   findings in the light of the Upper Tribunal's findings at  paragraph  (4)
   of the head-note to Nasim & Ors (Raju: reasons not to follow? : Pakistan)
   [2013] UKUT 610, as a departure from the principles in Raju. However such
   a submission was clearly misconceived, since that paragraph  specifically
   related  to  paragraph  34F  of  the  rules   concerning   variation   of
   applications, which was not relevant to the appellant's circumstances.

15. The judge, in remitting the case to the respondent, gave no reasons  for
   so doing and for concluding that the respondent's  decision  was  not  in
   accordance with the law. He ought, on the evidence before  him,  to  have
   been able to make a decision in regard to the appellant's ability to meet
   the immigration rules, yet he declined to do so. His reasons for so doing
   are unclear. Furthermore, his findings on section 47 of the 2006 Act were
   also clearly misconceived.  In  all  of  the  circumstances  the  judge's
   decision has to be set aside.

16. There was some discussion as to how the decision was to be  re-made.  Ms
   Isherwood  submitted  that  the  appellant's  appeal  should  simply   be
   dismissed on the basis that the requirements of the rules  had  not  been
   met in view of his own admissions on the documentation provided with  his
   application. Mr Khan, however, wished to make further  submissions  after
   being given an opportunity to see the respondent's appeal bundle  and  to
   take further instructions from the appellant. There was, I consider, some
   merit in Ms Isherwood's submission  and,  that  being  the  case,  little
   purpose would appear to be served by  remitting  the  case  for  a  fresh
   decision to be made. However, in view of the fact that in the absence  of
   the  respondent's  appeal  bundle,  there  was  uncertainty  as  to   the
   documentation provided with the appellant's application,  and  that  that
   appeal bundle was now available (and in  Ms  Isherwood's  possession)  it
   seemed to me that it was in the interests of justice for the matter to be
   reconsidered  by  the  Tribunal  with  the  benefit   of   the   relevant
   documentation. Indeed Ms Isherwood did not have  the  appellant's  appeal
   bundle and was therefore in some difficulty herself. In the circumstances
   I considered that the appropriate course would be for the  matter  to  be
   remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh.

DECISION

17. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
   making of an error on a point of law. The  decision  is  set  aside.  The
   appeal is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  pursuant  to  section
   12(2)(b)(i) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007  and
   Practice Statement 7.2(b), before any judge aside from Judge Prior.

     Directions

   No later than fourteen days from the date of this decision:
   1. The respondent is to file with the First-tier Tribunal and serve  upon
   the appellant the respondent's appeal bundle.
   2. The appellant is to file with the First-tier Tribunal and  serve  upon
   the respondent an  appeal  bundle  containing  all  documentary  evidence
   relied upon.
