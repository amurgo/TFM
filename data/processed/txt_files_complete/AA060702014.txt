                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

I was not addressed on the issue of anonymity by the parties and it  is  not
clear to me whether such a direction has  been  made  by  the  FtT.  In  any
event, it is appropriate in the circumstances that there is  such  an  order
and I make one.

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Iran and her date of birth is [  ]  1987.
    The appellant made a claim  for  asylum  based  on  her  conversion  to
    Christianity and this application was refused by the Secretary of State
    in a decision of 5 August 2014.  The appellant  appealed  against  that
    decision and her appeal  was  dismissed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Herwald  following  a  hearing  on  23  September  2014.   The
    decision was promulgated on 29 September 2014.

2.   The Upper Tribunal refused to admit the decision  on  1  January  2015.
    Following on from that, that decision was quashed by order of the  High
    Court on 9 June  2015  following  an  order  on  16  March  2015  where
    permission was granted because it was arguable that the decision of the
    Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  refuse  the  application  for
    permission  to  appeal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  not  admit   the
    application were decisions that were wrong in law.  Following  on  from
    that, permission was  granted  by  the  Vice  President  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal on 15 July 2015.  Thus the matter came before me.

The Decision of the FtT

3.   The issue of the concept of Taqiyya where Muslims are permitted to  lie
    was raised by the judge at the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.  The
    matter was put back  for  the  parties  to  consider  this  issue.  The
    Presenting Officer, when the hearing  was  reconvened  that  same  day,
    relied on printouts from a  website.   It  is  clear  having  read  the
    decision of the judge  that  he  attached  significant  weight  to  the
    concept of Taqiyya which he recorded was a matter of judicial knowledge
    (see paragraph 3) and to the  documents  submitted  by  the  Presenting
    Officer (see  paragraph 13(b), (c) and (d).)

4.   The judge heard evidence from the appellant and witnesses  relating  to
    the  appellant's  claim  to  have  converted  and  made  the  following
    findings;

         "(g) I must say that the  Appellant,  superficially,  made  a  good
             witness.  She cited  scripture.   She  said  that  she  was  a
             Christian 'according  to  Christian  sayings.   I  have  never
             lied'.  It was put to her that in 2011 she was found not to be
             a credible witness.  To put it bluntly, she was found to  have
             been lying.  Mr Dillon suggested to her that if she  was  able
             to produce an 'asylum story' by lying then, she might be doing
             so now as well.  This was her response: 'In my previous case I
             said the truth.  And from the time I became  a  Christian  and
             the Holy Spirit is within me, I  have  never  lied  and  never
             would'.

         (h)   Thus  it  became  apparent  to  me  that  the  Appellant  was
             maintaining that the history which she had recited beforehand,
             and which Judge Nicholson found to be a catalogue of untruths,
             was indeed the truth.

         (i)  Mr Gayle suggested to me  that  it  was  possible  that  Judge
             Nicholson got it wrong.  I am not bound  by  the  findings  of
             Judge Nicholson, but nothing I heard  today  persuades  me  to
             depart from his initial findings that so far as  I  can  tell,
             before him, this Appellant did not tell the truth.

         (j)  The case before me today, is whether or not she  is  indeed  a
             genuine convert.   The  fact  that  she  maintained  that  her
             earlier story was the truth, does not help.  It was put to her
             that she came to the United  Kingdom,  made  an  asylum  claim
             which was refused, appealed, and this was  refused,  and  then
             looked for other ways to say in the United  Kingdom.   I  note
             incidentally that she failed to claim asylum in  Germany,  and
             that this was found to have damaged her credibility  by  Judge
             Nicholson.

         (k)  The Appellant insisted that this was  not  the  case.   I  did
             however find her at some stages of her evidence to be somewhat
             evasive,  and,  I  might  say,  very  reliant  on   constantly
             repeating the mantra that Christianity does not permit  lying.
             She was asked what else she did at the church, and this is the
             sort of answer which I became used to: 'We have a duty to  see
             and know about each other.  I said if I could  help  anyone  I
             would be happy.   With  regard  to  someone  who  has  certain
             duties, that's all'.

         (l)  There was however  copious  evidence  from  others  that  this
             Appellant has not only attended church but  also  helped  with
             coffee mornings,  uses  her  IT  skills  to  assist  with  the
             newsletter, and has attended other church groups.

         (m)  The concept of takieh was  put  to  the  Appellant.   She  was
             reminded that given the concept of takieh,  if  and  when  she
             returned to Iran, she would be free to become  a  Shi'a  again
             and takieh would explain away her apparent  conversion.   This
             was her response:- 'I am a Christian, wherever  I  am  in  the
             world, takieh belongs to the Shi'a faith.  I am not a  Muslim,
             I am a Christian.  I have never had a reason to lie.  I  won't
             denounce my faith'.

         (n)  I found the Appellant to be somewhat evasive, somewhat reliant
             on Christian mantras (if I may call them that) and therefore I
             had to look to the  other  witnesses  to  gain  some  sort  of
             insight into their understanding of her claimed conversion.

         (o)  Reverend [T] is Rector of [L].   She  had  written  a  lengthy
             letter, and maintained,  very  clearly,  that  this  Appellant
             'radiated Christianity'.  This  was  very  powerful  evidence.
             However, on the other hand, it  soon  became  apparent  during
             cross-examination of Reverend  [T],  that  she  knew  next  to
             nothing about the background of the claimant, and knew nothing
             about the initial claim of the Appellant, which, I find, would
             have been helpful in the circumstances.  She insisted that she
             had spoken to the Appellant on many, many occasions,  and  has
             reason to know her, and yet she had no idea that the Appellant
             had, for  example,  failed  to  claim  asylum  in  Germany  or
             elsewhere.  The  Reverend  knew  nothing  of  the  concept  of
             takieh, and had  little  time  before  me  to  assimilate  any
             information about it, or to comment  upon  it.   She  conceded
             that she knew insufficient about Islam to be able to comment.

         (p)  She was asked by Mr Dillon how  many  other  Iranian  converts
             attended her church and she said that she had only been  there
             a year in all, and did not know about other Iranian converts.

         (q)  The thrust of questioning from Mr Dillon to  her  and  others,
             was that successful Iranian convert refugees might well  bring
             that idea to the attention of other unsuccessful refugees, and
             this might lead to a successful asylum claim.

         (r)  I note that the Appellant had been in the UK for nearly a year
             before she entered the church in June 2012, and  although  she
             claimed that at that stage she was at a low point in her life,
             no realistic reason was given for her suddenly turning to  the
             church on that occasion, or at that time.

         (s)  I am grateful to Reverend [T] for coming to court and  sharing
             her powerful views  on  this  young  woman.   But  I  am  also
             persuaded that the Appellant is an intelligent, well educated,
             well-read, and articulate young woman.  I  note  that  she  is
             capable of leaving Iran as she did, concocting a story to  put
             before the authorities in this country, spending nearly a year
             in Turkey beforehand and  then  failing  to  claim  asylum  in
             Germany.  I note that Reverend [T] knew nothing of the concept
             of takieh.

         (t)  Insofar as anyone can look into the heart and soul of another,
             in this case I am  not  persuaded  that  the  Appellant  is  a
             genuine convert to Christianity given  her  history,  and  her
             presentation before me.  I am however persuaded that  she  has
             managed, to put it given in the vernacular, to 'pull the wool'
             over the eyes of  the  trusting  and  perhaps,  with  respect,
             slightly na�ve Reverend Throup, who did not have experience of
             asylum seekers beforehand.

         (u)  Dr [G] was equally convinced that the  Appellant  was  a  true
             asylum  seeker,  in  that  she  had  genuinely  converted   to
             Christianity.  I remind myself that others said  the  same  in
             writing, but their evidence was not tested before me.  Dr  [G]
             gave evidence that he had come across previously, an insincere
             Pakistani claimed convert, who was nothing of  the  sort.   Dr
             [G] suggested that he was therefore 'on his  mettle'  he  said
             that he knew something of the concept of takieh but  this  was
             'an intelligent woman who has learned the Bible, and once  she
             had started one lie, she would have to continue  with  it  and
             people like that usually come unstuck'.  He reminded  me  that
             he had known her for more than two years.

         (v)  Again, on the face of it, this is powerful evidence, and I was
             grateful for his evidence and do not seek to suggest  that  he
             was attempting to mislead the court.   Rather,  I  am,  sadly,
             persuaded  that  the  Appellant  is  someone  who  has  sought
             successfully to mislead him.  Dr [G] was perhaps a little  too
             emphatic in his belief he could not possibly be wrong.   I  am
             not persuaded that  he  was  right  in  his  analysis  of  the
             Appellant's motives for conversion.

         (y)  I did not hear from Mr [A] as to whether or not he  agreed  it
             was March 2012 or March 2013, but frankly, in my view it makes
             little difference.  During that time, it is perfectly possible
             that  the  Appellant  would  have  met  other  Iranian  asylum
             seekers.  Whether or not she did, as I have said, this  is  an
             articulate clever young woman, with great IT skills, who would
             not have found it difficult to work out that by claiming to be
             a Christian in this country, one could avoid being  sent  home
             to Iran.

         (z)  My analysis is that here,  these  nice  people  who  have  all
             written generous testimonies for this  Appellant,  have  never
             considered that this might be a woman who has deliberately set
             out to deceive them over time, with a view  to  ensuring  that
             they came to give evidence that she  was  a  genuine  convert.
             During that period she has had time to 'learn the script'  and
             be able to present as a genuine Christian.  In short,  I  find
             that the Appellant has maintained a  sophisticated  ploy,  (as
             she did in a different way before Judge Nicholson)  and  I  am
             not persuaded that she is a genuine convert to Christianity."

The Grounds of Appeal and the Oral Submissions

5.   Mr Gayle submitted  that  he  made  oral  submissions  at  the  hearing
    relating to the source of the  background  materials  produced  by  the
    Presenting Officer. He conceded that there was no  application  for  an
    adjournment made.  Mr  Gayle  has  now  produced  evidence  that  would
    support the assertion that at least some of the material relied upon by
    the Presenting Officer was from a partial website.  The grounds do  not
    establish that the judge himself was  biased,  but  I  agree  with  the
    grounds that the assessment of credibility was flawed because there was
    unfairness caused to the appellant because of the judge's  reliance  on
    unsourced and potentially partial background evidence. I accept that Mr
    Gayle made submissions about the source of the material with which  the
    judge failed to engage. It is clear from the decision of the judge that
    he was heavily influenced by the material (and the  concept)  and  this
    had significant impact on the credibility assessment.  In hindsight  Mr
    Gayle should have asked for an adequate  adjournment  to  consider  the
    background evidence relied on by the respondent and which was  obtained
    at the eleventh hour.

6.   Whilst it is the case  that  there  is  a  previous  determination  and
    Devaseelan applies (Devaseelan  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2002] UKIAT 00702), which may not assist this appellant  in
    terms of credibility, in my view there was a material error of  law  in
    the decision of the judge for the  reasons  identified  above  and  the
    decision to dismiss the appeal is set aside. The matter was remitted to
    the FtT for a de novo hearing.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
