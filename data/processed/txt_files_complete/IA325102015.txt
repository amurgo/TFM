Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Gilbert of Counsel, instructed by Turpin &
                    Miller Solicitors (Oxford)
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica whose date of birth is  given  as
    20 March 1964.  The appellant entered the United Kingdom as  a  visitor
    with a visa valid for six months between 4 April  1998  and  4  October
    1998.  On 19 September 1998 he applied for leave to remain as a student
    and this was granted until 30 September 1999.   On  31  July  1999  the
    appellant married [DR], a British citizen.  He  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as a spouse on 10 March 2000 but his application was rejected.

 2. On 3 July 2002 the appellant was convicted at Oxford  Crown  Court  for
    conspiracy to supply class A controlled drugs.  He was sentenced  on  4
    July 2002 to ten years'  imprisonment.   He  was  not  recommended  for
    deportation.  On 22  March  2006  the  appellant  was  issued  with  an
    ICD.0242 warning letter informing him that  the  Home  Office  had  not
    decided to take any action against him on this occasion but may  do  so
    if there are any further convictions.

 3. The appellant's original spouse application from 2000 was  reconsidered
    on 25 February 2008 and he was granted  one  year  probationary  spouse
    leave between 25 February 2008 and 25  February  2009.   The  appellant
    made a further spouse application on 31 March 2009 which was refused on
    5 October 2009.  This was reconsidered on  5  March  2010  and  he  was
    granted further leave to remain between 13 June 2010 and 13 June 2012.

 4. The appellant made a further spouse application on 10 July 2012 and was
    granted further  leave  to  remain  under  the  two  year  transitional
    arrangements between 5 March 2013 and 5 March  2015.   On  10  February
    2015 the appellant was convicted at North London Magistrates' Court  of
    battery and was given a suspended imprisonment term  for  three  months
    which was wholly suspended for twelve months.  He was also asked to pay
    �300 costs and an �80 victim surcharge.

 5. The appellant made the present spouse application on 5 March 2015.  The
    appellant has two children born in the United Kingdom who  are  British
    citizens, [SR], who was born on [ ] 2000, and [JR], who was born on [ ]
    2007.

    The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision to  refuse  to
    grant leave to remain  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  a  decision
    promulgated on 8 June 2017 First-tier Tribunal Judge Beg dismissed  the
    appellant's  appeal.   The  Tribunal  found  that  it  would   not   be
    disproportionate to remove the appellant from the United Kingdom.   Any
    interference  in  the  appellant's  Article  8  rights  would  both  be
    legitimate and proportionate.  The appellant applied for permission  to
    appeal against the First-tier Tribunal's  decision.   On  3  July  2017
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew granted the  appellant  permission  to
    appeal.

    The hearing before the Upper Tribunal

 7. The grounds  of  appeal  assert  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Beg
    misdirected herself because she failed to give weight  to  Parliament's
    direction under Section 117B(6)  that  the  public  interest  does  not
    require the appellant's removal.  Reliance is placed  on  the  case  of
    Treebhawon and others (section 117B(6)) [2015] UKFUT 00674  (IAC).   It
    is asserted that it is clear that once the judge  had  found  that  the
    appellant had satisfied the criteria under Section 117B(6) his  removal
    was no longer in the public interest.

 8. In oral submissions Mr Gilbert referred to paragraphs 23, 26 and 36  of
    the First-tier Tribunal's decision.  It  is  implicit  in  the  judge's
    finding that the children were not expected to leave the United Kingdom
    that the judge considered it was not reasonable  for  the  children  to
    leave the United Kingdom.  He submitted that the Secretary of State  in
    the  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter  had  also  accepted  that  it   was
    unreasonable for the children to leave the United Kingdom as it says in
    that letter "this is because your children are not  required  to  leave
    the UK, they will continue to reside with their  mother,  in  the  same
    family unit as currently".

 9. He referred to the case of AM (Pakistan) & Ors v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 180 at paragraphs 16, 19 and 20 and
    submitted that it is clear that once a child has  satisfied  the  seven
    year Rule it would be unreasonable for the child to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.  It has been accepted that the appellant  has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship,  that  the  children  are  qualifying
    children, and the children are not expected to leave the United Kingdom
    as held in AM (Pakistan).  As the answer to those  three  questions  is
    yes the conclusion must be that Article 8 is  infringed.  He  submitted
    that the Court of Appeal in paragraph 19 in MA (Pakistan) supports that
    assertion.

10. He also submitted that the wider public interest issues can  only  come
    into play  via  the  concept  of  reasonableness.   In  this  case,  he
    submitted, that the judge has considered  the  wider  public  interests
    outside the concept of reasonableness  test.   He  submitted  that  the
    judge brought these considerations outside that discrete aspect of  the
    case.

11. When asked if Mr Gilbert still  relied  on  paragraphs  21  and  22  of
    Treebhawon Mr Gilbert indicated that he was no longer relying on  those
    paragraphs.

12. Mr Tufan submitted that  the  2015  decision  in  Treebhawon  has  been
    overruled in Treebhawon and Others (NIAA  2002  Part  5A  -  compelling
    circumstances  test)  [2017]  UKUT  13  (IAC).   The  Court  of  Appeal
    confirmed the ratio of MA (Pakistan) in the case of AM (Pakistan).   He
    submitted that the public  interest  and  conduct  of  the  parents  is
    relevant to the assessment of whether or not it is reasonable to expect
    children to leave the United Kingdom.

13. The appellant received a ten year sentence  of  imprisonment.   Despite
    the warning letter issued by the Home Office the appellant continued to
    commit criminal offences.  The appellant owes  over  �30,000  in  fines
    that have not been paid.

14. The Secretary of State cannot require or force the  children  to  leave
    the United Kingdom.  However, he submitted that this does not equate to
    an implicit acceptance on the part of the Secretary of State that it is
    not reasonable to expect the children  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    There is no implied finding by the judge that it  is  unreasonable  for
    the children to leave the United Kingdom.

15. In reply Mr Gilbert submitted that the only consideration of the  wider
    public  interest  that   is   permitted   is   when   considering   the
    reasonableness test.  If it is not reasonable for the children to leave
    the United Kingdom that  is  the  end  of  the  matter,  Article  8  is
    infringed.  The judge was not considering the  wider  public  interests
    under the consideration of reasonableness.

    Discussion

16. The appellant does not meet  the  suitability  requirements  under  the
    Immigration Rules. The case was advanced  and  was  considered  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal outside the Immigration Rules.  Having  found  that
    the  appellant  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
    qualifying child the essential issue in this case was whether or not it
    is reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK.

17. In MA (Pakistan) the court of appeal  considered  how  a  court  should
    approach the reasonableness test. The approach in Treebhawon (the  2015
    decision) (i.e. that s117B(6) precluded  consideration  of  the  public
    interest issues in 117B(1)-(3)) was not approved. The court held:
         "45. However, the approach I favour is inconsistent with  the  very
         recent decision of the Court of Appeal in MM  (Uganda) where  the
         court came down firmly in favour of the approach urged upon  us  by
         Ms Giovannetti, and I do not think that we ought to depart from it.
         In my judgment, if the court should have regard to the  conduct  of
         the applicant and any other matters relevant to the public interest
         when applying the "unduly harsh" concept under section 117C(5),  so
         should it when considering the  question  of  reasonableness  under
         section 117B(6). I recognise that the provisions  in  section  117C
         are directed towards the particular considerations which have to be
         borne in mind in the case of foreign criminals, and it is true that
         the court placed some weight on section 117C(2) which  states  that
         the more serious the  offence,  the  greater  is  the  interest  in
         deportation of the prisoner. But the critical point is that section
         117C(5) is in substance a free-standing provision in the  same  way
         as section 117B(6), and even so the court in MM (Uganda) held that
         wider public interest considerations must  be  taken  into  account
         when applying the "unduly harsh" criterion. It seems to me that  it
         must be equally so with respect to the reasonableness criterion  in
         section 117B(6). It would not be appropriate  to  distinguish  that
         decision simply because I have reservations whether it is  correct.
         Accordingly, in line with the approach in that case, I will analyse
         the appeals on the basis that the Secretary of  State's  submission
         on this point is correct and that the only significance of  section
         117B(6) is that where the seven year rule is  satisfied,  it  is  a
         factor of some weight leaning in favour of leave  to  remain  being
         granted."[emphasis added]

  21. It is clear that when  assessing  reasonableness  under  s117B(6)  the
      conduct of the appellant and matters relevant to the  public  interest
      should be taken into consideration. The appellant's ground in reliance
      on the 2015 decision in Treebhawon in this regard must therefore fail.

  22. Mr Gilbert relied on a passage from  AM  (Pakistan)  at  paragraph  20
      where it was held:

         "20...But the court also held that  section  117B(6)  was  a  self-
         contained  provision  in  the  sense  that  where  the   conditions
         specified in the subsection are satisfied, the public interest will
         not justify removal. The wider public interests considerations  can
         only come into play via the concept of  reasonableness  in  section
         117B(6) itself. In the light of this  decision,  the  Secretary  of
         State no longer pursues the second ground of appeal."

18. His submission was that the  judge  had  considered  the  wider  public
    interest  outside  the  reasonableness  test  and  that  this  was  not
    permissible as once the conditions in s117B(6 had been  satisfied  that
    was the end of the matter. Whilst this submission  is  correct  it  can
    only be relevant if the conditions in s117B(6) have been  found  to  be
    satisfied.

19. The judge's findings were:

         "36. I find that the appellant's relationship with  his  biological
             children is a genuine and  subsisting  relationship.   I  take
             into account the letter from St  Jude  and  St  Paul's  School
             dated 22 February 2017 from head teacher  John  Pearson-Hicks.
             He confirms that the  appellant  occasionally  collects  Jaden
             from school.  However I find that the appellant has never been
             the sole carer of the children.  The  person  who  has  looked
             after them since their birth  has  been  [DR].   Whilst  as  a
             general proposition it is in the best interests of children to
             live with both parents, in this instance the children  do  not
             live with their father.  The  children  are  not  expected  to
             leave the United Kingdom to live with the appellant.  [DR]  is
             not in a subsisting relationship with the appellant.   I  find
             that given the appellant's criminal offences  particularly  in
             relation to the supply of Class A drugs,  there  is  a  strong
             public interest in this case.  I  accept  that  the  appellant
             speaks English although he is not financially  independent  at
             the present time.  In Hesham Ali (Iraq) [2016] UKSC  60  which
             was deportation appeal, Lord Reed held that in approaching the
             question of whether removal is  a  proportionate  interference
             with Article 8 rights, only a claim which is  very  compelling
             will outweigh the public interest. [emphasis added]

         37.  I find that whilst the appellant has a  private  life  in  the
             United Kingdom, his private life was  established  at  a  time
             when his immigration status was precarious.  As  such,  little
             weight must be attached to it.  I find that he  built  up  his
             private life in the full knowledge that he  could  be  removed
             from the United Kingdom.   In  cross-examination  he  accepted
             that he received a letter from the Home Office  informing  him
             that if he  committed  further  criminal  offences,  the  Home
             Office would then seek to remove him from the United  Kingdom.
             He said he understood the contents of the letter.  The  letter
             which is dated  22  March  2006  states  'I  should  warn  you
             therefore that should you receive any further  convictions  at
             any point in the future, we are likely to  give  very  serious
             consideration   as   to   whether   to   pursue    deportation
             proceedings'.

         38.  I also take into account the letter from the Probation Service
             which appears at page 3 of the appellant's bundle, the licence
             and notice of supervision.  In assessing  the  evidence  as  a
             whole,  I  take  into  account  the  evidence  given  by  [DR]
             regarding the medical conditions of the  appellant's  children
             and his relationship with  them.   However  I  find  that  the
             appellant's criminal offences involving the  supply  of  drugs
             attracts public revulsion and tip  the  balance  against  him.
             Consequently, I find that any interference in the  appellant's
             Article 8 rights will be both legitimate and proportionate.  I
             find that immigration control is in the public interest."

20. The judge has simply referred to the fact that  the  children  are  not
    expected to leave the United Kingdom. The provision in 117B(6) has  two
    aspects.  The first is that the child is either a  British  citizen  or
    qualifying child and secondly that it must  be  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.  If the test  was  simply
    that a child could not be required to leave  the  United  Kingdom  then
    that additional reasonableness requirement would be  otiose  because  a
    British citizen child cannot be required to leave the  United  Kingdom.
    Mr Gilbert's submission was  that  it  is  implicit  from  the  judge's
    comment that the children are not expected to leave  the  UK  that  the
    judge has made a finding that it is not reasonable to  expect  them  to
    leave the UK. I do not accept this submission. The judge has failed  to
    make a finding on whether it or not it would be  reasonable  to  expect
    the children to leave the UK.

21. This is a material error of law as, although the  judge  does  consider
    carefully all the factors that she might have taken into  consideration
    when reaching a decision on reasonableness, those factors have not been
    applied to an assessment of the reasonableness of the children  leaving
    the UK and no conclusion was reached.

22. I find that there is a material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal
    decision. I set that decision aside pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the
    Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 ('TCEA').

23. I considered whether or not I could  re-make  the  decision  myself.  I
    considered the Practice Statement concerning transfer of proceedings. I
    am satisfied that the nature and extent of judicial fact  finding  that
    is necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be  re-made  is
    such, having regard to the overriding objective, that it is appropriate
    to remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal.

24. I remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal for the case to be heard at
    the First-tier Tribunal  at Taylor House before any judge   other  than
    Judge Beg  pursuant to section 12(2)(b) and 12(3)(a) of the TCEA. A new
    hearing will be fixed at the next available date.

25. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously. Having
    considered all the circumstances and evidence  I  do  not  consider  it
    necessary to make an anonymity direction.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed. The case is remitted to be heard de-novo  before  any
judge other than Judge Beg.
