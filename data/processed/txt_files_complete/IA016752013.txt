Representation
For the appellant: In person
For the respondent: Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant, a national of Pakistan, was granted leave to enter  the
      UK as a student until 25 July 2012. On 9 July 2012,  while  his  leave
      was still extant he applied for leave to remain in the UK  as  a  Tier
      4(General) Student Migrant under the Points Based  Scheme  and  for  a
      Biometric Residence Permit. On 7 January 2013 the  respondent  refused
      to vary his leave to enter and also decided to remove him  by  way  of
      directions under s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act
      2006. She pointed out that para 1A(h) of Appendix A of the Immigration
      Rules required him to show that he was in possession of  ï¿½1600  for  a
      consecutive 28 day period from the date of application which she  took
      as 4 October 2012, whereas the closing date  of  the  bank  statements
      submitted in support of his application was 9 July 2012.

   2. The appellant appealed. At the hearing on 11 April 2013 the  appellant
      explained that when he made  his  application  in  July  2012  he  had
      submitted documents showing evidence of the requisite funds within the
      two previous months, but his application had been returned because the
      respondent had been unable because of a mistake  in  his  credit  card
      details to collect the fee. When he resubmitted his bank statements in
      October 2012 he did not update his bank statements. Before  the  judge
      the appellant had  produced  evidence  in  the  form  bank  statements
      covering the two months prior to 9th July as well as  the  two  months
      prior to 4 October 2012.

   3. Applying Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) 2013 UKUT 0042 IAC) the  judge
      found that there had been  no  contact  by  the  respondent  with  the
      appellant in relation to  the  mandatory  evidence  required.  Finding
      further that the evidence  now  before  him  satisfied  him  that  the
      appellant had the requisite funds in the  relevant  two  month  period
      prior  to  4  October  2012,  the  judge  allowed  the   appeal,   his
      determination being sent to the parties on 24 April 2013.

   4. The grounds on  which  the  respondent  was  successful  in  obtaining
      permission to appeal were confined to a contention that  applying  the
      guidance set out in Rodriguez the judge was only entitled to find that
      the decision of the respondent was not in accordance with the law  and
      to remit it to the  respondent  for  her  to  make  a  fresh  decision
      applying her evidential flexibility policy.

   5. The appellant was not represented but made brief submissions  after  I
      had explained to him that I would do my best to ensure all  points  in
      his  favour  were  considered.  Mr  Jarvis  said   that   whilst   the
      respondent's challenge to the judge's conclusions was narrow in  scope
      it had to be right as a matter of law. He anticipated  that  when  the
      matter went back to the  respondent  the  appellant  would  receive  a
      further grant of leave to enter or remain as a student.

   6. Having considered the matter, I consider the judge did err in law  and
      that his decision is to be set aside. Essentially the judge sought  to
      allow the appeal outright on the basis of a failure by the  respondent
      to apply her evidential flexibility policy. However, as  a  matter  of
      law the appellant's  original  application  had  lapsed  and  his  new
      application  was  dated  4  October  2012.  When  he  resubmitted  his
      application on this date he did not enclose  updated  bank  statements
      but continued to rely on those from July. By s85A of the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 the judge was  prevented  from  taking
      into account the later evidence submitted at the hearing covering  the
      two months prior to 4 October, as that was post-application evidence

   7. Accordingly:

         The First tier Tribunal judge  materially  erred  in  law  and  his
         decision is set aside.


         The decision I re-make is to allow the appeal to the limited extent
         that the  decision  of  the  respondent  is  found  to  be  not  in
         accordance  with  the  law  for  failure  to  apply  an  evidential
         flexibility policy. The s.47 decision was unlawful.

   8. I would record that Mr Jarvis stated that he foresaw no difficulty  in
      the respondent accepting that applying this policy the appellant would
      stand to benefit and regard would  be  had  to  his  further  evidence
      relating to the two months proceeding 4 October.





                               Signed


                               Date:




                                Judge of the Upper Tribunal
