Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1.     The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
         granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ford  on  27  October  2014
         against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert  OBE
         who had allowed (to the limited extent of returning the decision to
         the  Secretary  of  State)  the  Respondent's  appeal  against  the
         Secretary  of  State's  decision  dated  24  September  2013  in  a
         determination promulgated on 15 September 2014.


    2.     The Respondent is a national  of  Nepal,  who  had  applied  for
         further leave to remain as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant,
         which was refused on the grounds that although  the  Appellant  had
         submitted a valid CAS, he had  not  shown  that  he  satisfied  the
         maintenance requirement.   The  Appellant  had  not  produced  bank
         statements showing that he was in possession of the required sum of
         ï¿½1600 for the required 28 day period.  The application was  refused
         under paragraph 245ZX(d) of the Immigration Rules. The reasons  for
         refusal letter  conveying  the  decision  to  refuse  to  vary  the
         Respondent's existing  leave  incorporated  a  second  decision  to
         remove the Respondent by way of directions under section 47 of  the
         Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


    3.     Judge Ford considered it arguable that Judge Herbert OBE  should
         not have returned the decision to the Secretary of State as he  had
         not made  a  finding  that  the  missing  evidence  fell  with  the
         evidential flexibility policy (paragraph 245AA of  the  Immigration
         Rules).  It was unclear why the decision had been remitted.


    4.     The Respondent's  solicitors  informed  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
         writing prior to the appeal hearing that he  was  content  for  his
         appeal to be determined in his absence on the papers.


    5.     Mr Bramble for the Appellant relied on the onwards  grounds  and
         the grant of permission to appeal.   He  produced  a  copy  of  the
         relevant Immigration Rules in force at the  date  of  decision,  so
         that the tribunal could see the terms of paragraph 245AA.  This was
         not a situation of a missing page from a sequence of documents,  as
         in paragraph 245AA(b)(i), but rather  an  additional  bank  account
         whose existence had not been notified to the  Secretary  of  State.
         Paragraph 245AA  thus  had  no  application.   The  judge  had  not
         identified the basis on which the Secretary of State's decision was
         not in accordance with the law.


    6.     No further submissions had been made on the Respondent's behalf.


    7.     At the conclusion of submissions the tribunal indicated that  it
         found that the judge had fallen into material error of law, for the
         reasons identified in the grant of permission  to  appeal,  and  as
         further developed in Mr Bramble's submissions.  These need  not  be
         repeated here.  The Secretary of State could not  consider  a  bank
         account, statement(s) from which had not  been  provided  with  the
         application.  The judge rightly reminded himself that he could  not
         take into account post  application  evidence  in  a  Points  Based
         System appeal.  No unfairness in the Secretary of State's  decision
         making process was identified.


    8.     The determination must be and is  accordingly  set  aside.   The
         determination must be remade.  The Respondent had not complied with
         paragraph 245ZX(d) of the Immigration Rules.  His  appeal  must  be
         dismissed.  It of course remains open to  him  to  submit  a  fresh
         application, as indicated in section E of the reasons  for  refusal
         letter, although he may not enjoy a right of appeal  in  the  event
         that his application is refused.


    DECISION


         The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error
         on a point of law. The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.




         The determination is set aside and remade as follows:


         The original Appellant's appeal is DISMISSED


         There can be no fee award as the appeal was dismissed






    Signed Dated 26 November 2014
