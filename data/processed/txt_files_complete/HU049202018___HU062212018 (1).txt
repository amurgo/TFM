For the Appellant:     Ms S Jones, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Z Malik of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant before the Upper Tribunal is the  Secretary  of  State  for
   the Home Department and the respondents are citizens  of  Bangladesh  and
   are husband and wife. As the appeal of the wife rests or falls with  that
   of her husband, I shall consider the appeal of the husband. However,  for
   the sake of convenience, I shall continue to refer to the latter  as  the
   "appellant" and to the Secretary of the State as the "respondent",  which
   are the designations they had in the proceedings  before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

2.     The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the
   decision of the respondent refusing his application for indefinite  leave
   to remain based on his 10 years continuous lawful residence in the United
   Kingdom  pursuant  to  paragraph  276B  of  the  immigration  rules.  The
   appellant's appeal was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian in a
   decision promulgated on 3 October 2018.

3. Permission to appeal was at first refused by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   Kelly in a decision dated 25 October 2018  and  subsequently  allowed  by
   Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic on 2 January 2019 stating that it is  arguable
   that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  erred  in  considering  whether  the
   appellant had misrepresented his earnings to UKVI or to HMRC and  whether
   that warranted refusal under paragraph 322 (5).

4. Thus, the appeal came before me.

5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed the appellant's  appeal  and  found
   that the appellant had not misrepresented his earnings to UKVI or to  the
   HMRC but had only been "careless" for signing his tax return but had  not
   deceitful or fraudulent. The Judge stated that he accepts  on  the  civil
   balance of probabilities having regard to the  appellant's  evidence  and
   the documentation provided with respect of his accountants and  that  the
   appellant should be given the benefit of doubt as to his  good  character
   and conduct. The Judge concluded that  the  appellant's  explanation  has
   discharged the burden of proof incumbent upon him on the  civil  standard
   of proof.

6. Paragraph 322 (5) provides that a person  does  not  need  to  have  been
   convicted of a  criminal  offence  for  this  provision  to  apply.  When
   deciding whether to refuse under this category, the key thing to consider
   is if there is  reliable  evidence  to  support  the  decision  that  the
   person's behaviour calls into question their character and or conduct and
   all their association to the extent that it is undesirable to allow  them
   to enter or remain in the United Kingdom.

7. The respondent's position is that  the  appellant  did  misrepresent  his
   earnings deliberately in order to gain an advantage.  The  respondent  in
   his grounds of appeal states that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred  in
   his assessment of the discrepancies in the tax returns by submitting  one
   set of returns for HMRC and another to  the  respondent.  The  respondent
   stated that the appellant's failure to recognise his underpayment of tax,
   his delay in rectifying the error with HMRC and the timing of the payment
   of arrears coincided with his claim for indefinite leave to remain.  This
   demonstrates deliberate intent on the part of the appellant as opposed to
   mere carelessness. The respondent argued that this was a misdirection  in
   law for the Judge's failure  to  provide  adequate  reasons  on  material
   matters. The grounds states that the appellant acted in a  way  that  was
   calculated  to  delay  paying  income  tax  until  it  became  absolutely
   necessary which was just before he had to make his application for  leave
   to remain under the 10-year route. The appellant failed to make  accurate
   declarations of his tax liability at the time this  liability  arose.  It
   was stated that had  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  properly  considered
   paragraph 322 (5) it may well have reached a  different  conclusion.  The
   Tribunal should have addressed this  issue  and  its  failure  to  do  so
   renders the decision incomplete.

8. When a respondent makes an allegation of fraud, it is trite law that  the
   burden of proof rests  on  the  respondent  to  establish  any  contested
   precedent fact on a balance of probabilities. There was no dispute  which
   the appellant and the First-tier Tribunal Judge acknowledged  that  there
   were discrepancies in the accounts that he submitted to HMRC and  to  the
   respondent.  Therefore,  the  Judge  accepted  that  the  respondent  had
   satisfied his burden of proof at a prima facie level.

9. The Judge then considered the appellant's explanation to  decide  whether
   it was a deliberate attempt by the appellant to  mislead  the  respondent
   and the HMRC or whether it was mere carelessness on the appellant's  part
   and that there was no dishonesty or deceit involved. The Judge considered
   the appellant's explanation that the appellant's two  sets  of  different
   accountants had made a mistake and the appellant signing them was  merely
   careless.

10. The issue for me to decide is whether the Judge made  a  material  error
   of law in his reasoning for accepting the appellant's explanation for the
   discrepancies in his submission of tax returns.

11. This reasoning is at  paragraph  62  of  the  decision.  The  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge in deciding that the appellant had not been  deceitful  or
   dishonest, took into account the evidence of a default judgement  against
   the accountants of 12 June 2018 for ï¿½9877.98. The Judge  also  considered
   the evidence provided by the appellant which essentially related  to  the
   appellant's complaints about  the  accountant.  He  also  considered  the
   evidence of the appellant's solicitor's complaints to the Association  of
   International Accountants on 1 August  2018  and  submitted  amended  tax
   returns which the  appellant  claims  that  the  accountants  delayed  in
   submitting. This flurry of activity was generated  after  the  respondent
   brought to the attention of  the  appellant  the  irregularities  in  his
   accounts.

12. At the hearing it was submitted by Miss Jones that it  is  not  credible
   that two different sets of accountants made mistakes and that  each  time
   the appellant  was  merely  careless  in  signing  them.  The  respondent
   referred to the case of R (on the application of  Khan)  v  Secretary  of
   State for the Home Department (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph  322(5))
   [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC) (1) Where there has been a significant difference
   between the income claimed in a previous application for leave to  remain
   and the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State  is  entitled  to
   draw an inference that the Applicant has been deceitful or dishonest  and
   therefore he should  be  refused  ILR  within  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
   Immigration Rules.  Such an inference could be expected where there is no
   plausible explanation for the discrepancy; (2)  Where  an  Applicant  has
   presented evidence to show that, despite the prima  facie  inference,  he
   was not in fact dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of  State
   must decide whether the explanation and evidence is  sufficient,  in  her
   view, to displace the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty; (3)  In
   approaching that fact-finding task, the Secretary of State should  remind
   herself  that,  although  the  standard  of  proof  is  the  "balance  of
   probability", a finding that a person has been deceitful and dishonest in
   relation to his tax affairs  with  the  consequence  that  he  is  denied
   settlement in this  country  is  a  very  serious  finding  with  serious
   consequences; (4) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her  accountant
   for an "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not  be  the
   end of the matter, given that the accountant will or  should  have  asked
   the tax payer to confirm that the return was accurate and to have  signed
   the tax return. Furthermore, the Applicant will have known of his or  her
   earnings and will have expected to pay tax  thereon.   If  the  Applicant
   does not take steps within a reasonable time to remedy the situation, the
   Secretary of  State  may  be  entitled  to  conclude  that  this  failure
   justifies a conclusion that there has been deceit or dishonesty; (5) When
   considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest or merely  careless
   the Secretary of State should consider the following matters, inter alia,
   as well as the  extent  to  which  they  are  evidenced  (as  opposed  to
   asserted):

         (i)      Whether the explanation for the error by the accountant is
         plausible;

         (ii)     Whether the documentation which can be  assumed  to  exist
         (for  example,  correspondence  between  the  Applicant   and   his
         accountant at the time of the tax return)  has  been  disclosed  or
         there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;

         (iii)    Why the Applicant did not realise that an error  had  been
         made because his liability to pay tax was less than he should  have
         expected;

         (iv)     Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has  taken  steps  to
         remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps  were  taken  and
         the explanation for any significant delay.

13. The Judge while he accepted the communication  to  the  solicitor  after
   the anomalies were brought to the  attention  of  the  appellant  in  the
   respondent's reasons for refusal letter,  he  did  not  question  whether
   there was any communication between the Applicant and his  accountant  at
   the time of the tax return. He also did not address the  question  as  to
   why the appellant did not realise that an error had been made because his
   liability to pay tax was less then he  should  have  expected  given  his
   earnings. These were important issues to be  addressed  which  the  Judge
   failed to do and thereby fell into material error.

14. Having considered the decision by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  I  find
   that the matters set out in the case of Khan were not considered  by  the
   First-tier Tribunal Judge when allowing the appellant's appeal.  I  agree
   with the respondent that  the  decision  is  incomplete  without  a  full
   analysis of paragraph 322 (5) and that had  this  been  done  arguably  a
   different decision might have been reached.

15. I therefore decide that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   should be set aside as it contains a material error of  law  as  he  gave
   inadequate reasons for believing  the  appellant  in  light  of  all  the
   evidence. I direct that the appeal be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal
   for findings of fact to be made in a de novo hearing. I direct  that  the
   appeal be placed before any First-tier Tribunal Judge  other  than  Judge
   Andonian at the first available date

DECISION

The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed, and the appeal  is  remitted  to
the First-tier Tribunal
