Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Khan (counsel)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 27 September 2017 to allow the  appeal  of
       Laila Hassan Ismail Maatouk, a citizen of Egypt born 14 August  1957,
       itself brought against the Home Office decision of 31 October 2016 to
       refuse her application on human rights grounds.

    2. The Respondent entered in the UK as a visitor on 12 July  2015  as  a
       visitor with leave until 18 November 2015; she  applied  before  that
       leave expired for further leave to remain, which was  granted,  as  a
       visitor for private medical treatment, valid until  10  August  2016.
       The application leading to  the  present  appeal  was  based  on  her
       suffering from a degenerative disease in her lumbar  spine,  pain  in
       her hips and  knees,  and  experienced  episodes  of  paralysis.  She
       considered herself unable to live in Egypt as she needed the care  of
       her son, Basem Moorad, in the UK.

    3.  The  application  was  supported  by  a  letter  from  a  Consultant
       Orthopaedic Surgeon, Mr  Tindall,  of  September  2015,  stating  she
       suffered 2-3 episodes of left leg paralysis daily which were becoming
       more frequent, leaving her in pain for several minutes and  immobile;
       recently her leg collapsed from under her whilst she was crossing the
       road and only her son's help got  her  to  safety.  She  felt  unsafe
       outside the home and her mobility was very restricted. In his opinion
       she would require a carer if she resided in the UK. Her  son's  fears
       that she would be unable to care for herself on  a  return  to  Egypt
       seemed highly likely to be realised on  the  basis  of  Mr  Tindall's
       assessment.

    4. The application was refused, on the basis that it was essentially  an
       adult dependent relative application made impermissibly  from  within
       the UK, and  as  the  Respondent  would  not  face  very  significant
       obstacles to integration back in Egypt, a country where she had lived
       for most of her life and where she had two sons to rely on. She owned
       property in Egypt, and savings, and received financial  support  from
       her son. Having regard  to  the  high  threshold  recognised  in  the
       authorities including N v United Kingdom 2008 47 EHRR  885,  she  had
       not demonstrated that she was in  the  final  stages  of  a  terminal
       illness or that her condition would rapidly deteriorate upon removal.
       Accordingly she would not face any  violation  of  the  Human  Rights
       Convention were she to return to her home country.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from the  Respondent  and  her
       son. She stated her health issues began in 2009/2010;  she  had  then
       lived in Egypt on her own, without a carer. In the UK,  her  son  was
       her sole source of care, helping her before  and  after  he  went  to
       work.

    6. Mr Moorad gave evidence, saying he had found out how bad his mother's
       health had become when she arrived in the UK in 2015, before which he
       had not seen her for six years. Her last visit had been in 2007.  Her
       condition had worsened here.  She  could  not  use  public  transport
       unless he was with her, and she had no income in Egypt.

    7. The Appellant had not been supported  by  her  former  husband  since
       their divorce, and relied on his income. She had two sons  in  Egypt,
       one who had psychiatric problems and had not had anything to do  with
       her since the divorce, and the other who worked in a city 280km  away
       as a Petroleum Chemical Engineer. She lived in Alexandra,  in  a  7th
       floor flat, and had fallen over there at the  end  of  2014.  He  had
       obtained help for her from a local person after that incident.  Their
       extended family in Egypt were all married and working.

    8. She needed nursing care and a carer in Egypt could not necessarily be
       trusted, and would cost �700 a month, which he could not afford  from
       his NHS salary of �25,000; his brother could not assist as he  earned
       only �380 monthly.

    9. The First-tier Tribunal accepted the facts as advanced by mother  and
       son, noting that the flat here had now  been  adapted  for  her  bed,
       toilet and shower needs.

   10. It directed itself that the Immigration Rules should be  taken  as  a
       starting  point,  and  noted  the  acceptance  of  counsel  for   the
       Respondent that she could not meet the Rules'  requirements  nor  the
       high threshold of N. The Judge concluded that there were  exceptional
       circumstances present here: she  had  "complex  and  declining  [sic]
       medical needs, mainly of a physical nature", that could only  be  met
       via her UK-based son. Such care as might be available  in  Egypt  was
       unaffordable. It was accordingly disproportionate to her private  and
       family life to expect her to return to Egypt.

   11. Grounds of appeal from the Secretary  of  State  contended  that  the
       First-tier Tribunal had erred in law in treating Article  8  ECHR  as
       more easily accessed than Article  3  ECHR  without  identifying  any
       compelling or separate element to her claim. The First-tier  Tribunal
       had failed to give adequate reasons for accepting the evidence  given
       to it as to care costs in Egypt or as to why she required her son  in
       the UK as a carer given he left her for the  length  of  the  working
       day,  and  had  effectively  treated  her  receipt  of  free  medical
       treatment in the UK as  counting  in  her  favour.  Additionally  the
       factors in section 117B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act
       2002 had not been considered.

   12. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  on  13  November  2017,  giving
       particular attention to the  failure  to  address  the  section  117B
       considerations.

   13. At the hearing before  me,  Mr  Tarlow  developed  those  grounds  of
       appeal,  emphasising  that  the  statutory  factors  were   mandatory
       relevant considerations, and maintaining that inadequate reasons  had
       been provided for the very concise the conclusions to which the First-
       tier Tribunal had come. Mr Khan replied that whilst this  might  well
       be an error of law, it was not a material one, because the  decision,
       though concise, addressed the  relevant  matters  that  section  117B
       required to be assessed.

Findings and reasons

   14. The Upper Tribunal stated in Forman [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC) that:
           "In cases where the provisions of sections 117B-117C of the 2002
           Act arise, the decision of the Tribunal  must  demonstrate  that
           they have been given full effect."

   15. In Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA  Civ  803  �45,  Sales  LJ  noted  that  "the
       starting point for consideration of the proper construction  of  Part
       5A of the 2002 Act is that sections 117A-117D,  taken  together,  are
       intended to provide for a structured approach to the  application  of
       Article 8 which produces  in  all  cases  a  final  result  which  is
       compatible with, and not in violation of, Article 8."

   16. The essential requirement that Tribunal decision making takes account
       of  the  public  interest  factors  identified  by  section  117B  is
       therefore beyond doubt. Unfortunately, it is clear that this did  not
       happen in this particular case; as agreed on all sides, there  is  no
       reference to those factors in the decision.

   17. So the question then arises as to whether this failing is material to
       the decision making. It is possible to imagine a scenario  where  the
       considerations identified in section 117B are addressed, expressly or
       by inevitable inference, without the statutory provision itself being
       set out. However, this is not such a case. There is no  consideration
       of the English language proficiency of Ms Maatouk, and no recognition
       of the relevance of the fact that at least some of her  medical  care
       in the United Kingdom has been at public expense: that of course is a
       factor which counts against the refusal of a human rights claim being
       disproportionate to the public interest sought to be protected by the
       immigration decision. In Akhalu [2013] UKUT  00400  (IAC)  the  Upper
       Tribunal  held  that  whilst  matters   of   health   were   relevant
       considerations in assessing a private and family life claim,  it  was
       also necessary "to recognise that the countervailing public  interest
       in removal will outweigh the  consequences  for  the  health  of  the
       claimant because of a disparity of health care facilities in all  but
       a very few rare cases."

   18. Furthermore, given Ms Maatouk had no expectation of remaining in  the
       UK for an extended period having entered the country  as  a  visitor,
       her residence must be treated as "precarious", all the more so  given
       she lacked the entry clearance which  the  adult  dependent  relative
       route normally requires. However, the First-tier Tribunal  failed  to
       evaluate the extent to which her health  had  unforeseeably  declined
       post-arrival such as to justify departure from  the  entry  clearance
       route.

   19. Finally,  it  is  noteworthy  that  whilst  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       correctly identified the potential relevance of the  adult  dependent
       relative route as a benchmark by which to measure  the  viability  of
       the Respondent's  human  rights  claim,  it  only  engaged  with  the
       criteria which require satisfaction under that  route  to  a  limited
       degree. For example, at Appendix FM paragraph E-ECDR.1.1 onwards,  it
       is clear that an applicant must "as  a  result  of  age,  illness  or
       disability  require  long-term  personal  care  to  perform  everyday
       tasks"; it must be shown that care is not available  "even  with  the
       practical and financial  help  of  the  sponsor  because  it  is  not
       available and there is no person in that country who  can  reasonably
       provide it; or it is not affordable." And  the  "specified  evidence"
       provisions supporting those requirements  require  a  report  on  the
       available healthcare abroad from a central or local health  authority
       or other health professional.

   20. Those  considerations  must  of  course  be  assessed  realistically,
       recognising that the Rule must be construed  sensibly  so  as  to  be
       capable of satisfaction, see Sir  Terence  Etherton  MR  in  Britcits
       [2017] EWCA Civ 368 �59: "Those considerations include issues  as  to
       the accessibility and geographical location of the provision of  care
       and the standard of care. They are capable of embracing emotional and
       psychological requirements verified by expert medical evidence.  What
       is reasonable  is,  of  course,  to  be  objectively  assessed."  The
       decision below failed to apply  sufficiently  detailed  consideration
       for its reasons to meet the required standard.

   21. Accordingly I find that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
       flawed by material errors of law.

   22. Nevertheless, when the appeal  is  lawfully  determined  outside  the
       Rules, the First-tier Tribunal will wish to bear in mind that  health
       problems may be are highly relevant to the  degree  of  dependency  a
       migrant has upon their family here. As noted by Underhill  LJ  in  GS
       India [2015] EWCA Civ 40 �111, "where article 8 is engaged  by  other
       factors, the fact that the claimant is receiving medical treatment in
       this country which may not be available in the country of return  may
       be a factor in the proportionality exercise; but that  factor  cannot
       be treated as by itself giving rise to  a  breach  since  that  would
       contravene the "no obligation to treat"  principle."  Alongside  him,
       Laws LJ wrote �86: "If the Article 3 claim fails ... Article 8 cannot
       prosper without some separate or  additional  factual  element  which
       brings the case within the Article 8 paradigm - the capacity to  form
       and enjoy relationships - or a state of affairs having some  affinity
       with the paradigm."

   23. A mixed family and private life claim, as where a mother  is  heavily
       dependent on a son for emotional as well as physical  support,  might
       satisfy that threshold: as was noted in MM (Zimbabwe) [2012] EWCA Civ
       279 at [23], where "the appellant ha[s] established firm family  ties
       in  this  country,  then  the  availability  of  continuing   medical
       treatment here, coupled with his dependence on the  family  here  for
       support, [may] together establish 'private life' under Article 8  ...
       Such a finding would not offend the principle  ...  that  the  United
       Kingdom  is  under  no  Convention  obligation  to  provide   medical
       treatment here when it is not available in the country to  which  the
       appellant is to be deported." This will be a matter  for  the  First-
       tier Tribunal re-determining the appeal.

    Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law.  As the  appeal  will  have  to  be  fully  re-determined,  it  is
    appropriate to remit the matter for re-hearing.
