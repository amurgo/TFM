Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Waqas Azhar (the Sponsor)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan, was born on 19 March 1984. She  has
   been given permission to appeal against the determination  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge  Paul  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the  respondent's
   decision to refuse entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as  a  family
   visitor.

2. The appellant applied for entry clearance to  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
   family visitor on 3 July 2012, stating in her application form  that  she
   intended to stay in the UK ten days, to visit her cousin Waqas Azhar. She
   stated that was a self-employed teacher and provided home tuition and had
   an annual income from employment of Rs 25000 in addition to  income  from
   her family.

3. The respondent, in refusing the appellant's application, did  not  accept
   that she was genuinely seeking entry as a visitor or that she intended to
   leave the United Kingdom at the end  of  her  visit,  since  she  had  no
   dependants, she had not substantiated her income and she had demonstrated
   few ties to  Pakistan.  Particular  concerns  arose  out  of  unexplained
   deposits paid into her account, amounting to Rs 200,000 (ï¿½1,360), in June
   2012, which  were  inconsistent  with  her  claimed  income  and  account
   history.

4. In her Notice of Appeal the appellant indicated that she did not  require
   an oral hearing of her appeal. She referred, in her grounds,  to  further
   evidence attached relating to her employment and  income  and  explaining
   the deposits into her account which came from  the  cashing-in  of  prize
   bonds.  She  also  referred  to  her  family  income  which   came   from
   agricultural and rented land and to other ties she had in Pakistan. In an
   Appeal Review, the Entry Clearance  Manager  considered  the  grounds  of
   appeal but maintained the decision on the basis that the  ECO's  concerns
   had not been addressed.

5. The appellant's appeal was determined on the  papers  by  the  First-tier
   Tribunal. Judge Paul, in  dismissing  the  appeal  on  23  January  2013,
   commented on the lack of oral  evidence  and  found  that  the  documents
   submitted had not addressed the concerns raised in the refusal  decision.
   He accordingly dismissed the appeal under the immigration rules.

6. In response  to  the  appellant's  application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
   permission to appeal was granted on 5 April 2013 on the grounds that  the
   judge had arguably  failed  to  examine  the  documents  and  had  simply
   endorsed the conclusions of the ECO and the ECM.

Appeal Hearing

7. The appeal came before us on 18 June 2013.

8. Mr Deller accepted that the judge's decision ought to  be  set  aside  on
   the grounds that he appeared to  have  simply  rubber-stamped  the  ECM's
   conclusions  without  having  given  any  consideration  himself  to  the
   documentary evidence submitted by the appellant.  We  noted  in  addition
   that the ECM appeared in fact to have overlooked the documents  submitted
   by the appellant at pages B18 to B20 and  B23  to  B32  and  the  judge's
   decision compounded that error. We accordingly  set  aside  Judge  Paul's
   decision.

9. In view of the fact that the appellant had previously requested that  the
   appeal be determined on the papers, and given that the sponsor was in any
   event present before us, we considered it appropriate to go on to re-make
   the decision ourselves rather than remit it to the  First-tier  Tribunal.
   Both Mr Deller and the sponsor were in agreement. The  sponsor  confirmed
   that there was no further documentary evidence to be submitted  and  that
   the decision  could  be  made  on  the  evidence  already  available.  He
   indicated that he was happy to answer any questions put to him.

10. In response to Mr Deller's cross-examination, Mr  Azhar  confirmed  that
   he had never sponsored a visit  previously  and  that  all  the  relevant
   documentary  evidence  had  been  submitted  to  response  to  the  ECO's
   concerns.

11. In response to our enquiry as to why  the  appellant  was  proposing  to
   stay in a hotel rather than with him, Mr Azhar said that that was because
   he shared a house with someone and so could not accommodate her. He  said
   that she was a teacher and taught in a private school whose name  he  did
   not know. She was his uncle's daughter and would be coming to the  United
   Kingdom for two to three weeks. She would return to Pakistan as  all  her
   family were there and she worked. He did not know if she  owned  her  own
   property but he knew that she lived with her parents.  He  did  not  know
   where the deposits in her account had come from and neither did  he  know
   why those funds had  largely  disappeared  from  her  account  after  her
   application had been refused. He last saw her three years ago.

12. Mr Deller submitted that the appellant had not met the burden  of  proof
   upon her and that the appeal had to be dismissed. Mr Azhar, in  response,
   submitted that the  documents  addressed  all  the  ECO's  concerns.  The
   appellant would definitely go back to Pakistan after her visit.

Consideration and findings

13.  The  respondent,  in  refusing   the   appellant's   application,   was
   particularly concerned with the lack of reliable evidence of  her  income
   and employment and the large, unexplained deposits in her  account  prior
   to her application being submitted. Mr Azhar, the sponsor, was unable  to
   assist in that regard and  appeared  to  have  little  knowledge  of  the
   appellant's circumstances, aside from confirming that she was a  teacher.
   He relied upon the documentary evidence from the appellant  as  providing
   an adequate response to the respondent's  concerns.  However  we  do  not
   consider that the evidence does  in  fact  satisfactorily  address  those
   concerns.

14. The appellant's bank statement shows two large  deposits  made  in  June
   2012, for Rs 175,000 on 12 June 2012 and Rs 25,000 on 19 June  2012.  The
   Rs 25,000 deposit is explained  by  the  appellant  as  her  income  from
   employment, as is indeed consistent with the information provided in  her
   visa application form. The Rs 175,000 is  explained  in  the  grounds  of
   appeal as coming from prize bonds purchased from her  savings  which  she
   had saved up for her trip and which she  had  cashed  in.  The  appellant
   produced, with the grounds of appeal, copies of ten prize bonds each  for
   Rs 40,000. However, what she did not include was any evidence that  those
   bonds were in fact the source of the deposits into her account, since she
   produced no evidence to show when, where and if  they  had  been  cashed.
   Indeed, there is no explanation as to why the bonds were retained by  her
   if she had cashed them in. The majority of the bonds all  contain  stamps
   dating from 1999  to  2005  suggesting  that  that  was  when  they  were
   purchased and thus somewhat undermining the claim that  they  represented
   savings for the current trip, several years later. Furthermore, the bonds
   do not give the name of the bond-holder and their value far  exceeds  the
   amount of money deposited into her account. All in all  the  bonds  carry
   very little weight as evidence of the source of  the  deposits  into  the
   appellant's account. Somewhat significantly, as we  pointed  out  at  the
   hearing, the majority of those funds appear to have been  withdrawn  from
   the account following the refusal  of  the  appellant's  application,  as
   shown in the bank statement submitted for the hearing, dated 1  September
   to 20 November 2012.

15. In addition to the  lack  of  explanation  about  the  deposits  in  the
   appellant's account, there is little or no evidence of  her  income  from
   employment. Whilst  her  bank  statement  shows  deposits  of  Rs  25,000
   consistent with a claimed monthly income of that amount, that is in  turn
   more consistent with salaried employment rather than self-employment. The
   appellant's evidence as to her employment is also somewhat limited in its
   reliability and weight, given  that  the  documents  produced  appear  to
   emanate from various sources rather than providing  confirmation  of  the
   academy, The Teacher Training Academy Lahore, named  in  the  grounds  of
   appeal.  At page B18 there is a document confirming  employment  for  the
   past four years at Al-Azeem school, whilst B19 is  a  document  from  ELC
   confirming employment for the past  four  years.  A  letter  subsequently
   produced by the appellant for the appeal, dated 11 September  2012,  also
   confirms employment  over  the  past  four  years.  That  letter,  whilst
   apparently emanating from a different school, namely New Era  College  of
   Sciences, appears to be worded almost identically to the letter of 11 May
   2012 from ELC. Rather than addressing the  respondent's  concerns,  those
   documents in fact give rise to further concerns about the reliability  of
   the appellant's claim as regards her employment.

16. Accordingly, we do not consider that the  appellant  has  satisfactorily
   addressed  the  respondent's  concerns.  In  the  light  of  the  various
   unexplained discrepancies in the evidence, as outlined above, we conclude
   that she has failed to provide any reliable evidence of her financial and
   other circumstances in Pakistan. That in turn leads to concerns about the
   reliability of her stated intentions in  applying  to  visit  the  United
   Kingdom and we do not consider that she has met the burden  of  proof  to
   demonstrate that she is a genuine family visitor. We do not find that she
   is able to meet the requirements of the relevant immigration rule, namely
   paragraph 41 of HC 395 and we dismiss her appeal in that respect. Article
   8 has not been raised, but in any event it is clearly not the  case  that
   the respondent's decision gives rise to any claim in that respect.

DECISION

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error
   on a point of law. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  therefore
   set aside. We re-make the  decision  by  dismissing  the  appeal  on  all
   grounds.
