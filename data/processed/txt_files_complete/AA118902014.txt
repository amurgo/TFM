                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Pooler, promulgated on 21st December 2016, following a hearing at
    Stoke-on-Trent on 14th December 2016.  In the determination, the judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen  of  Iraq,  who  was  born  on  29th
    October 1995.  He appealed  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 8th November 2009 refusing his  asylum  claim
    and granting him discretionary leave as an  unaccompanied  minor  until
    17th November 2012.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he has a well-founded fear of persecution
    in Iraq, that his parents were assassinated when he was approximately 5
    or 6 years old, that following this his cousin took him away from  Iraq
    to live in Spain and in Rome until he was about 11 years  of  age,  and
    then he travelled through Belgium to come to the  UK  where  he  sought
    asylum.  The relevant facts and documentary material are set out in the
    determination under appeal and I need not recite them here again.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge had regard to a previous decision  by  IJ  Coates  under  the
    principles set out in Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702 (see paragraph 18).
     On the occasion before Judge Pooler also, Mr Dracott was in attendance
    as Counsel on behalf of the Appellant, and he referred to the report of
    Dr George which considered the report of Ms Guest, so as to enable  him
    to submit that the findings of Judge Coates were not cogent and had now
    been overtaken by the evidence of Dr George (see  paragraph  18).   The
    judge also gave consideration to the inconsistency in  the  Appellant's
    evidence, about his father's death, about the manner in which  he  came
    to the UK, and about  the  Appellant's  nationality.   He  went  on  to
    conclude that the fact that the Respondent had stated that removal  was
    to be  to  Iraq  did  not  preclude  the  Respondent  from  challenging
    nationality.  Specifying Iraq as the removal destination did not amount
    to acceptance of the Appellant's claim (paragraph 23).   He  held  that
    for this reason the Appellant had failed to  discharge  the  burden  of
    proving that he met the definition of a refugee.  The same  applied  in
    relation to Article 3 (paragraph 28).

 5. With regard to Article 8, the judge went on to conclude that  Iraq  was
    specified as the country of removal for the purposes of the immigration
    decision.  However, the Appellant had failed to prove  that  he  was  a
    national of Iraq.  That being so, he could not discharge the burden  of
    proving the existence of significant obstacles to his integration  into
    the country to which he would have to go (paragraph 30).  The burden of
    proof rested in relation to statelessness on the Appellant.

 6. It was not sufficient for him to assert that because he had been  found
    not to be a national of Iraq then he  must  be  stateless.   (Paragraph
    37).  With regard to Section 117B of the 2002  Act,  it  was  concluded
    that the balance of considerations  fell  against  the  Appellant.   He
    spoke English but that was a neutral factor.  He was living  in  shared
    accommodation and earning about �300 to �400  per  week.   He  had  not
    claimed benefits.  He was financially independent.   However  this  too
    was a factor that was neutral  in  this  regard.   The  maintenance  of
    effective  immigration  control  under  Section  117B(1)  governed  the
    situation (paragraph 43).

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the  judge  erred  in  concluding
    that the Appellant had not discharged the burden  of  proof  given  his
    young age at the time that he left his country of  origin.   He  was  a
    westernised Iraqi.  He had no knowledge of his country of  origin.   He
    had no knowledge of the  Iraqi  language.   He  would  be  at  risk  of
    persecution from Jihadi Islamist groups in Iraq, as  well  as  criminal
    gangs there.  The grounds also assert that the judge erred  in  respect
    of determining the Appellant's nationality.

 8. On 8th February 2017, permission to appeal was granted.

 9. On 3rd February 2017 a Rule 24  response  was  entered,  and  this  was
    followed by another Rule 24 response on 16th February 2017, the  latter
    to the effect that the Tribunal had directed itself  appropriately  and
    properly dealt with the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE(vi).   The
    Article 8 assessment was open to the judge.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 4th April 2017, Mr  Dracott,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, made detailed  and  lengthy  submissions.   He
    stated that he relied upon the grounds of application.  He handed up  a
    copy of the recent decision in Kaur [2017] UKUT  00614.   He  submitted
    that one must not lose sight of the fact that the Appellant  left  Iraq
    when he was 5 or 6 years of age,  lost  any  knowledge  of  his  Arabic
    language, as well as of Iraqi culture, living overseas in  Spain  until
    the age of 10 or 11, before coming to the  UK,  and  Judge  Pooler  had
    failed to engage with this basic background fact.

11. Second, this was relevant because it went directly to the issue of  the
    burden of proof on the Appellant in relation to his nationality.  Given
    his age at the time, his state of mind, and the situation in  which  he
    found himself, he had surely succeeded in establishing his nationality.
     The expert report by Julia Guest  and  Dr  Ali  George  had  not  been
    properly heeded.  In a case where the Appellant was 5  or  6  years  of
    age, the expert  evidence  really  needed  to  be  grappled  with  (see
    paragraphs 20 to 21), and the judge had failed to do so.  Instead, what
    the judge said was that, "Dr George's reference to place names  outside
    Iraq, as befits an independent expert whose duty is  to  the  Tribunal,
    does nothing to assist the Appellant in terms of his home area  or  his
    nationality" (paragraph 20).  Moreover, Judge Pooler noted  that,  "his
    evidence in this respect has not been put to Ms Guest" (paragraph  20).
    An inappropriate standard of proof had been applied.

12. Third, it was not insignificant that the Secretary of State had granted
    discretionary leave to remain to the Appellant.  There was  a  lack  of
    sufficient good  reception  centres  in  Iraq,  and  that  is  why  the
    Appellant had been granted discretionary leave in the  manner  that  he
    had,  such  that  the  Secretary  of  State  plainly   recognised   his
    nationality in this respect.  It was incorrect to say that  "specifying
    Iraq as the removal destination does not amount to  acceptance  of  the
    Appellant's claim" (paragraph 23).

13. Fourth, the judge  had  nevertheless  concluded  that,  "the  Appellant
    failed to prove that  he  was  a  national  of  Iraq"  (paragraph  30).
    Nevertheless the removal directions were to Iraq.   The  fact  remained
    that the Appellant could not return to the place to which  the  removal
    directions had been set.

14. Finally, there was the issue of Article 8.  The Appellant had now lived
    for seven years and one month in the UK, but Judge Pooler's  assessment
    of this was that this matter was not relevant (see paragraphs 31 to 33)
    when it plainly was.  The  Appellant  had  been  granted  discretionary
    leave to remain.  During that time he had made an  in-time  application
    for further leave to remain.  On that basis, his present stay in the UK
    was not "precarious" as he was not in the country unlawfully.  In fact,
    he had engaged in schooling in this country, had been living here  from
    a young age, and these were matters that the judge  needed  to  grapple
    with before reaching a view as to the proportionality of  his  removal.
    He was fluent in English and he  was  financially  independent.   These
    were firm conclusions that the judge came to.  They may be  neutral  in
    themselves but they are not relevant to the balance of  proportionality
    considerations.

15. Instead, IJ Pooler went too far (at paragraph 42) in stating  that  the
    Appellant's private life has been  established  at  a  time  "when  his
    immigration status has been at best precarious"  (paragraph  42).   The
    case of Kaur [2017] UKUT 00614 now establishes that the fact  sensitive
    nature of a stay in this country does not always operate  in  the  same
    way in every case and a more heightened importance can be given to such
    a stay where a person has been in this country lawfully.  The Secretary
    of State has not asserted any other nationality  on  the  part  of  the
    Appellant.  This too was relevant to the way in which  the  balance  of
    considerations fell under Article 8.  It was not the  case  that  under
    Section  117B(1)  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control
    operated against the Appellant.

16. For his part, Mr Bates submitted that the Appellant's age had not  been
    challenged.   Nevertheless,  the  appeal  could  not  succeed  for  the
    following reasons.  First, even if the Appellant had left Iraq  at  the
    age of 5 or 6, the  issue  still  remained  whether  he  was  an  Iraqi
    national, and this had been rejected by the Tribunal  in  2009  and  in
    2014 because the Appellant could not speak any Arabic and his knowledge
    was very sparse of his country.  That was the starting point in respect
    of the decision of Judge Pooler presently.  Second, there  was  nothing
    in the expert's report that could be  determinative  of  the  issue  of
    nationality.  Third, if there were no  reception  facilities  in  Iraq,
    then, given that it was contested  that  the  Appellant  was  an  Iraqi
    national, this could not be of any assistance to the Appellant as such.
     Fourth, the Appellant had been rejected in his  asylum  claim  on  the
    basis of discrepancies in  his  answers  during  his  cross-examination
    before Judge Pooler in the instant case (see paragraphs 16 to  17),  so
    that it was not the case that Judge Pooler had simply confined  himself
    to the position as determined at the time of the decision previously by
    Judge Coates.  Fifth, the Appellant was now an adult and  still  failed
    to give credible answers.  Finally,  with  respect  to  Article  8  the
    Appellant only had six years of discretionary leave to remain.  He  had
    three years of exceptional leave to remain from the ages of  14  to  17
    years.  He then reapplied but the decision was not made  until  he  was
    18.  After three years of exceptional leave to remain, he  had  Section
    3C leave  under  the  Immigration  Act.   His  asylum  application  was
    dismissed and so was his Article 8 application.  Even if he had been in
    the UK for seven years he was not going to get any extended  period  of
    leave unless there were compelling circumstances, especially since  his
    stay in the UK had always been precarious.  Section 117B was  clear  in
    that "little weight should be attached" to an Article 8 life  that  had
    been built up at a time when one's stay  was  precarious.   The  recent
    decision in Kaur [2017] UKUT 00614 did  not  appreciably  change  Judge
    Pooler's evaluation of the facts before him.  He was still entitled  to
    conclude as he did.  Even starting from the  unchallenged  position  of
    the decision of Judge Coates, Judge Pooler was entitled to conclude  as
    he did.

17. In reply, Mr Dracott submitted that at  paragraph  57  of  the  refusal
    letter of  11th December  2014,  it  was  expressly  accepted  by  the
    Respondent that the Appellant had been moving around from a very  young
    age.  Second, what this meant was that Judge Pooler's assessment of the
    Appellant's claimed nationality had to start from the age  of  4  to  5
    when he left Iraq, rather than from the age of 11 or 12  when  he  left
    Spain to come to this country.  His failure to do so meant that he  had
    misdirected himself in this regard.  Had he not done so his  assessment
    of the Appellant's nationality would have been more  accurate.   Third,
    if  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not  clear  about  the  Appellant's
    nationality then she should have  said  so,  and  concluded  that  this
    country could not send the Appellant back to a country  which  was  not
    his country of origin, but instead  a  view  was  expressed  about  the
    adequacy of reception  centres  in  Iraq.   There  could  be  only  one
    conclusion drawn from that, namely,  that  it  was  accepted  that  the
    Appellant was a citizen of Iraq.

No Error of Law

18. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   In  coming  to
    this conclusion  I  have  had  regard  to  the  bundle  of  authorities
    (including paragraph 351 of HC 395); Section  10  of  the  Respondent's
    asylum process instructions on discretionary  leave;  the  Respondent's
    asylum policy  guidance  "nationality:  doubtful,  disputed  and  other
    cases" of 26th March 2013; exerts from the Respondent's  asylum  policy
    guidance "processing children's asylum claims" of 12th July  2016;  and
    the decision in Mlloja [2005] EWCA 2833, that Mr Dracott  drew  regular
    attention to.  My reasons for concluding that there is no error of  law
    are as follows.

19. First and most important, there is the guidance provided in the case of
    Mlloja [2005] EWHC 2833.  Mr Justice Gibbs  asks  the  potent  question
    here, "what significance, if any should the court attach to the failure
    to treat the claimant as a child"?  (At paragraph 33).  There  is  then
    consideration of  how  "the  claimant  cannot  establish  a  particular
    substantive issue which would have been  differently  decided  had  the
    proper procedure been adopted" (paragraph 34).  In  the  present  case,
    however, it is neither the case that the Appellant has not been treated
    as a child, and nor is it the case that proper procedure has  not  been
    adopted.  But in any event,  even  if  there  was  any  basis  to  this
    suggestion, I am not satisfied that the outcome  would  have  been  any
    different.  In fact, Justice Gibbs makes it clear that, "I certainly do
    not go so far as to say that procedural errors in the form of breach of
    guidance would be fatal in all cases" (paragraph 35).  This is  a  case
    where the decision with respect to the Appellant's nationality had been
    reached both in 2009 and in 2014.  Judge Coates had also  decided  that
    the Appellant could not show that he was a person of Iraqi nationality.
     Expert reports were submitted before Judge Pooler  on  this  occasion.
    It was stated that the findings of Judge Coates were not cogent and had
    been overtaken by the evidence of Dr George (see paragraph 18).

20. However, the judge did give consideration to  precisely  these  matters
    and concluded (at  paragraph  20)  that  matters  were  not  taken  any
    further.  But in any event, and no  less  significantly,  under  cross-
    examination before Judge Pooler  the  Appellant  failed  to  provide  a
    cogent explanation for his inconsistencies  and  the  judge  was  clear
    that,  "the  Appellant's  replies  to  have  been  vague  and  evasive"
    (paragraph 17).

21. Second, it is said that the Appellant has  been  granted  discretionary
    leave to remain and that this is indicative of the  acceptance  of  his
    claimed nationality.  However, in MS [2015] UKUT 00539, Mr Justice Dove
    confirmed that,

         "The current discretionary leave policy (applicable since 24th June
         2014) as well as his predecessor (the policy in place from at least
         November 2012)  states  that  the  RLR  policy  will  apply  unless
         exceptional circumstances justify divergence from the policy".

    That was the position here.  It still remained  for  the  Appellant  to
    establish his nationality notwithstanding the  grant  of  discretionary
    leave to remain.

22. Third, in the circumstances, and  in  relation  to  the  evaluation  of
    Article 8 considerations, the judge's conclusions  under  Section  117B
    remained open to him and there is no error of law (at paragraphs 41  to
    43).

Notice of Decision

23. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

24. No anonymity order is made.

25. This appeal is dismissed.
