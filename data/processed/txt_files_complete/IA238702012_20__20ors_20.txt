                                                                  Respondent


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL



1.     These were appeals by the appellants to the original  appeal  against
    the decision dated 4 January 2013 of First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett
    to refuse leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4  Student  Migrant  (or  as  a
    dependent of such) or on Article 8 grounds. Permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal was granted on 24 January 2013.

 2. In line with Rule 17 (1) (a) of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, the appellants have applied in writing  to  withdraw  their
    appeals. The Tribunal consents to the withdrawal.

 3. There is therefore no application for permission to appeal  before  the
    Upper Tribunal and the decision of First-tier Tribunal Grimmett stands.




Signed:                                 Dated: 11 June 2013
Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt
