Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr L Tarlow (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Claimants:     Mr S Sharma (Counsel instructed by H M Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an error of law hearing.  The appellant  is  the  Secretary  of
    State and I shall refer to the  respondents  in  this  matter  as  "the
    claimants".

2.   The claimants are husband and wife,  citizens  of  Pakistan  and  their
    respective dates of birth are 4 February 1988 and  8  April  1986.   On
    11th September 2012 the first claimant applied for leave outside of the
    rules with the second claimant as his dependent.

3.   In a decision and reasons  before  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Eames)
    (FtT) promulgated on 19 March 2015 the  second  claimant's  appeal  was
    allowed on immigration grounds under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  and  both
    appeals were allowed on Article 8 grounds outside the Rules.  No  issue
    has been taken on the decision that  Article 3 ECHR did not apply.

4.   In a lengthy, detailed and considered determination the FtT  considered
    family and private life under the Immigration Rules at Appendix FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE and outside  of  the  Rules  under  Article  8.   Both
    claimants entered the UK separately as students on different dates; the
    first claimant arrived in 2005 with valid leave  until  September  2009
    and thereafter his application for  further  leave  was  refused.   The
    second claimant arrived in 2011 also with a student  visa  valid  until
    August 2014 and her leave was curtailed on  11  May  2012.  The  couple
    intended to celebrate a traditional Islamic marriage shortly after  the
    second claimant's arrival. In the event  they  cohabited  for  a  short
    period. Then the second claimant was admitted to hospital on 9 May 2011
    with a headache and following a sudden deterioration in her health  she
    suffered irreversible brain  damage  from  tuberculosis  and  is  in  a
    comatose vegetative state.  She now resides in a nursing home where she
    has highly restricted power  of  movement,  is  bed  bound  and  cannot
    swallow and the prognosis is poor, there being no likely change in  her
    current condition.  It was accepted that the  parties  had  only  lived
    together in a relationship akin to marriage for one month prior to  the
    illness.

5.   At [31-32] the FtT set out facts relating to the  immigration  history,
    relationship, marriage and medical situation.   The  second  claimant's
    care needs were listed at [32e] and the FtT found that she required 24-
    hour care and supervision, was immobile and needed  the  assistance  of
    two people for all transfers, repositioning and all activities of daily
    living, was at risk of chest  infections  and  aspiration  and  had  no
    distinguishable communication, was unable  to  maintain  her  own  safe
    environment and was extremely vulnerable.  It  was  accepted  that  the
    brain damage was irreversible.

6.   At (32J) the FtT found that the  claimant's  health  care  arrangements
    were being funded by the NHS and the cost was some �913 per week.

7.   At (32K) the FtT accepted that the cost of an air  ambulance  from  the
    UK to Islamabad was in the region of �103,000 and found that  it  would
    be technically possible for the claimant to  travel  to  Pakistan  with
    medical assistance as indicated in a GP report by  Dr  Shah.   The  FtT
    further found having regard to the claimant's care needs and the  first
    claimant's evidence, that travel to Pakistan would entail  considerable
    pain, indignity, distress and difficulty.

8.   At (32I) the FtT  found  that  the  second  claimant  had  commenced  a
    medical negligence case against health  care  providers  and  that  the
    likely timeline for completion would be two to three years and that the
    second claimant's presence was likely to be required.

9.   At [32M] the FtT found that in the light of the  prognosis  there  were
    fairly fine differences in the quality of care as between  the  UK  and
    Pakistan and as such this would not make any  difference  to  her  life
    expectancy.

10.  At [32N] the  FtT  found  that  the  claimants  cohabited  following  a
    religious ceremony for a number of weeks after  the  second  claimant's
    arrival. The  first  claimant  had  since  regularly  and  consistently
    attended to and visited his wife, showing commitment to her.

11.  At [33] the FtT considered private  life  under  paragraph  276ADE(vi).
    Reference was made to Ogundimu (Article 8 - new Rules)  Nigeria  [2013]
    UKUT 60 IAC and emphasis was placed on the word "ties" as  involving  a
    connection to  life  in  the  home  country  and  involving  a  rounded
    assessment not limited to social, cultural and family ties.

12.  At [42] onwards the FtT found a strong emotional family link  with  the
    second claimant's parents living in Pakistan. At [47] the FtT found the
    second claimant had no ties in Pakistan in light  of  "the  exceptional
    fact of her calamitous medical history puts the analysis of ties  under
    a very different spotlight than normal.  It did  not  just  weaken  her
    ties to Pakistan; it effectively guillotined them."

13.  At [48] the FtT considered Article 8  private  life  and  found  family
    life with the first claimant. The FtT set out the factors  weighing  in
    favour of the second claimant and  the public interest factors [54-55].



14.  The FtT considered Akhalu (Health claim: ECHR Article  8)  [2013]  UKUT
    00400 IAC and  referred to aspects of the judgment in JA (Ivory  Coast)
    ES  (Tanzania)  v  SSHD  [2009]   EWCA   Civ   1353   considering   the
    proportionality balance to be carried  out  in  respect  of  Article  8
    claims in health cases where the public interest arguments include  the
    cost of providing health care  treatment  [54/55].   The  court  in  JA
    identified the existence of an obligation to weigh the  moral  duty  to
    help others in need and the fact that  the  UK  has  found  it  morally
    compelling and economically possible until recently to extend such help
    without detriment to the settled population.

15.  The FtT found the case was  exceptional  and  engaged  the  moral  duty
    identified  in  JA  [60].   It  found  there  would  be  a  significant
    interference with the second claimant's physical integrity in  the  act
    of moving her to Pakistan.  The high cost to the UK  was  mitigated  by
    the fact the NHS decided to provide her with treatment  and  there  was
    the  possibility  of  a  successful  medical  negligence  claim.    Her
    condition arose whilst in the UK lawfully and the fact of her remaining
    in the UK unlawfully was "unavoidable".  The FtT  considered  that  the
    effect of Section 117B(4) and  (5)  was  diminished.   The  FtT  found,
    despite her condition, a level of private life that was  "very  robust"
    in that there was a network of care provided by the NHS and of love and
    attention provided by her husband.

16.   The  FtT  found   family  life  for  the  first  claimant   that   was
    exceptionally strong.  The claimant spoke English, was  self-supporting
    and the marriage entered into when he was lawfully present in the UK.

Grounds of Application

Ground 1

17.  The Secretary of State contends that the FtT made perverse findings  to
    the degree that they were irrational.  The  decision  that  the  second
    claimant satisfied paragraph 276ADE was an error.  The FtT  misdirected
    itself in finding the appellant had no ties in Pakistan  by  virtue  of
    her vegetative state.  The FtT adopted the role of medical  expert.  It
    cannot be presumed that the claimant has no elements  of  awareness  at
    all such that her ties to Pakistan are severed.

18.  Alternatively,  the  findings  were  irrational  given  the  claimant's
    condition, her integration into UK society ceased at the point  of  her
    illness together with any enjoyment of private life.

19.  Further, perversity occurred to  the  extent  that  the  FtT  found  an
    exceptionally strong family life with the first claimant yet no ties in
    Pakistan due to her vegetative state.

Ground 2

20.  The FtT erred in its proportionality assessment under Article  8  ECHR.
    It made a factual error as to the length of residence  in  the  UK  and
    inappropriate weight was attached to that period of time.

Ground 3

21.  The FtT erred in allowing the second claimant's appeal on the basis  of
    her Article 8 private life by way of a material  misdirection  of  law.
    The FtT failed to have regard to the precarious nature  of  the  second
    claimant's status and  gave  insufficient  weight  to  the  effects  of
    Section 117B(4) and (5) 2002 Act as amended.  The  FtT  concluded  that
    the continued illegal stay  in  the  UK  of  the  second  claimant  was
    unavoidable.  Private  life  accrued  while  present  in  the  UK  with
    precarious immigration status should be awarded little  weight  in  the
    overall proportionality assessment.  The cost of NHS care was a weighty
    consideration in light of the finding that the quality of the  care  as
    between the UK and Pakistan  would  make  no  difference  to  her  life
    expectancy.  The FtT failed to follow  the  correct  approach  in  N  v
    Secretary of State and Akhalu.   The  public  interest  ought  to  have
    outweighed the appellant's rights to private life.

Ground 4

22.  The FtT failed to give adequate reasons for finding that the  appellant
    would suffer acute interference with her integrity due to  the  process
    of removal  to  Pakistan.   The  finding  contradicted  the  claimants'
    medical  evidence.   Removal  was  possible  with  appropriate  medical
    evidence which the Secretary of State agreed to provide and to fund.

23.  The errors made by the FtT in  respect  of  the  second  claimant  were
    relied on as errors the decision made for the first claimant's.

Permission to Appeal

24.  Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy  on
    22 May 2015, who stated that it was arguable that  the  FtT  failed  to
    attach sufficient weight to public interest  factors  in  allowing  the
    appeal.

Claimants' Skeleton Argument

25.  Mr Sharma produced a skeleton argument submitting  that  the  Secretary
    of State's complaints amount to a disagreement with the FtT's  findings
    and  were  limited  to  challenges  to  factual  findings  rather  than
    misdirection in law.  Reliance was placed on  SSHD  v  AH  (Sudan)  and
    Others [2007] UKHL 49, MA (Somalia) v SSHD [2010] UKSC 49 (paras  44  &
    45) and Shizad (Sufficiency of reasons: set aside)  Afghanistan  [2013]
    UKUT 85 IAC, Budhathoki (Reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 341 IAC.

Error of Law Hearing

Submissions

26.  Mr Tarlow relied on the detailed grounds of  appeal,  expanded  on  the
    same and relied Akhalu (cited above).  Mr  Sharma  made  a  preliminary
    submission that the grant of permission was  limited  to  ground  3  as
    regards public interest factors.

27.  Mr Sharma argued that there was no perversity in the two findings  made
    namely that the second claimant had no ties in the UK and  the  finding
    of a strong family life.  The FtT gave cogent reasons  as  to  why  her
    ties were meaningless.  The family relationship was found for the first
    appellant and was only relevant to the second claimant in that context.
     The second claimant did not need to establish strong family life given
    the conclusion reached by the Tribunal under paragraph 276ADE.

28.  As to ground 2 Mr Sharma accepted that the FtT referred to a period  of
    residence in the UK that was in accurate and incorrect. This was not  a
    material error as the FtT's decision was not based  on  the  length  of
    residence but on cumulative factors.

29.  Mr Sharma submitted that ground 3, focussing on Section 117B,  was  the
    only ground on which permission was given.  The  Tribunal  had  carried
    out a detailed consideration of public  interest  factors  and  made  a
    rational decision in concluding that the public interest was outweighed
    by exceptional and compassionate circumstances.

30.  As to ground 4 Mr Sharma submitted that this was a disagreement on  the
    evidence.  The FtT  considered  the  evidence  of  Dr  Shah,  Professor
    Ormorod  and  the  first  claimant's  in  making  findings  that   were
    sustainable to support the conclusion that the  second  claimant  would
    suffer acute interference by the process of removal.



Discussion and Decision

31.  I am satisfied that all four grounds of appeal are made out  such  that
    the approach adopted by the FtT was flawed and amounts  to  a  material
    error of law. I reject Mr Sharma's submission that the permitting Judge
    only granted leave in respect of the third ground, no  such  limitation
    was made.

32.   I  consider  first  the  decision  under  paragraph  276ADE.  The  FtT
    proceeded correctly on the basis that this was not a "medical case". It
    was common ground that in  Pakistan  the  second  claimant  would  have
    medical care together with the support of her family,  the  support  of
    the first claimant and that  there  would  be  no  foreseeably  adverse
    consequences to her health, life or prognosis as compared with the  UK.
    The FtT followed Ogundimu to the extent that it emphasised the need for
    real and meaningful ties  in  the  home  country.  The  FtT  found  "no
    meaningful ties" in Pakistan because the second Claimant was, by reason
    of her vegetative state, incapable of having real ties or  connections.
    I am satisfied that this approach amounts to a misdirection in law. The
    FtT failed to consider "ties" in the context of what ties there are and
    would  they  provide  support  for  the   claimant   (YM(Uganda)   SSHD
    C5/2013/1864).   In  other  words  whether  there  is   any   continued
    connection with life such that the second claimant would  be  supported
    on return, notwithstanding her vegetative state.   The  FtT  considered
    the ties  only  from  the  Claimant's  subjective  perspective.  It  is
    manifestly clear on the evidence that the Claimant has family ties  and
    connections in Pakistan where she lived for the majority  of  her  life
    and where she would be supported. The FtT  failed  to  make  a  rounded
    assessment of the familial, social and cultural ties and connections in
    light of her condition  and  more  importantly  the  level  of  support
    available to her. Furthermore it was perverse for the FtT  to  discount
    "ties" by reason her vegetative state but yet to find  that  there  was
    family life in the UK with the first claimant.

33.  Ground 2 is also made out.  It was common ground that the  FtT  made  a
    factual error as to the length of residence which was in fact  2  years
    rather than 9 years. The length of residence was  material  as  it  was
    taken into account in the assessment of proportionality.

34.  I consider the Article 8 private life outside  of  the  rules  and  the
    contention under ground 4 that inadequate reasons were given. As stated
    above the FtT clearly found that this was not a "medical" case. The FtT
    [32m] found that the quality, availability and level of care in the  UK
    and in Pakistan would make no difference to the  claimant's  prognosis,
    life or life expectancy following to Akhalu (45). The focal  issue  for
    the FtT was whether or not the actual removal of the second claimant to
    Pakistan amounted  to  a  disproportionate  in  interference  with  her
    private life in terms of personal integrity. The  question  is  whether
    removal has sufficiently adverse effect on the second  claimant  and  a
    direct bearing on the prognosis.  The FtT also considered that  the  UK
    was under a moral duty to help others in need.   It  cannot  be  argued
    that the FtT did not conduct a  balancing  exercise  of  the  competing
    factors. But where it erred  was  in  reaching  a  finding  and  giving
    reasons in support that there would be a significant interference  with
    private life, that was  not  sustainable  on  the  evidence.   The  FtT
    imposed its own view in the absence of any expert medical  evidence  to
    counter the GP's opinion that the second claimant could be removed with
    the assistance of a medical team. The evidence  as  to  her  continuing
    care needs on a daily basis can be presumed to  have  been  taken  into
    account by her GP. I consider that the FtT failed to  place  weight  on
    the clear and unambiguous report of Dr Shah and  wrongly relied on  the
    evidence from the first claimant that the journey  would  involve  pain
    and indignity (32K) (absent any medical evidence). The  fact  that  the
    NHS assumed responsibility for the care of the Claimant  is  a  neutral
    factor, but the indefinite  cost  of  care  is  a  relevant  factor  in
    considering the public interest. The FtT clearly accepted  the  medical
    evidence as to the claimant's vegetative state and there was simply  no
    evidence to show that an acute interference with her moral or  personal
    integrity would arise from a medically assisted  removal.   Accordingly
    the approach adopted by the FtT in purporting to follow JA  as  regards
    the moral duty upon the UK to provide care for others, is  in  my  view
    flawed.  The FtT made no clear or specific findings of fact as  to  the
    nature and effect of the removal  on  the  Claimant  in  terms  of  any
    decline or suffering.  For those reasons and the very considerable cost
    to the UK, I am satisfied that  the  FtT  erred  in  finding  that  the
    individuals interests outweighed the strong  public  interest  factors.
    Added to which there was no evidence that family or  private  life  for
    the first claimant could not be continued in Pakistan and  the  failure
    to properly consider section 117(4) and (5).  Whilst it was unavoidable
    that the claimant became ill, the FtT ought to have taken into  account
    the immigration history of both  parties  and  its  precarious  nature.
    There was no proper consideration  of  the  fact  that  both  claimants
    entered as students, for temporary purposes,  the  first  claimant  was
    unlawfully in the UK since May 2010.

35.  Although the FtT regarded medical negligence proceedings  as  a  lesser
    factor, the need for the second Claimant's continued presence in the UK
    was not established in evidence before the FtT. There was  no  evidence
    from her solicitors to that effect.  Furthermore  there  was  full  and
    detailed expert evidence of her care needs now and  in  future.   There
    was no evidential basis for the findings  that  the  second  claimant's
    presence was likely to be required for the  purposes  of  pursuing  her
    medical negligence claim.

36.  As regards the first claimant's family life, I find that the FtT  erred
    by failing to follow the Razgar stages. The FtT  gave  no  reasons  for
    finding that there would be either interference or  a  disproportionate
    interference  in  the  first  claimant's  family  life.  There  was  no
    consideration of the fact that both claimants entered as students,  for
    temporary purposes, the first claimant was unlawfully in the  UK  since
    May 2010  and the second claimant ceased to be able to study because of
    her illness from 2011 and her leave expired, but  she  had  no  further
    leave granted.   There was no evidence that the  first  claimant  would
    not be able to return to Pakistan where  he  could  continue  to  enjoy
    family life with his wife. There was no evidence to show any reason why
    the first claimant's family life or indeed private life had  to  be  in
    the UK rather than Pakistan.

37.  I find material errors of law in the decision and reasons  which  shall
    be set aside.

Remaking decision

38.  In remaking the decision I have regard to all the evidence  before  the
    FtT and in particular the agreed facts as presented in the decision and
    reasons.  I see no argument for any further  arguments  or  hearing  in
    this Tribunal as the matters have been fully argued.  I  conclude  that
    the appeals of both claimants stand to be dismissed on immigration  and
    human rights grounds.

Notice of Decision

39.  The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.

    The  appeals  of  the  first  and  second  claimant  are  dismissed  on
    immigration and human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
