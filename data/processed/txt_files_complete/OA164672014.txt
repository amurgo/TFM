Representation:
For the Claimant: Ms Cronin (Counsel)
For the Entry Clearance Officer: Mr Kotas  (Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal against the  decision  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge H. Clark promulgated  on  the  29th  October
      2015, in which she allowed the Claimant's  appeal  against  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer's decision to refuse her entry clearance to join her
      adopted mother in the United Kingdom.  The Claimant is  a  citizen  of
      Ghana of who was born on the [ ] 2010.

   2. Within her  decision  although  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  H.  Clark
      accepted that Ms [O], the Claimant's adoptive mother, had duly adopted
      the Claimant by means of an Adoption Order in the High Court in  Ghana
      on the 20th December 2013 and that Ms  [O]  was  the  Claimant's  sole
      parent and was present and settled in the United Kingdom and that  she
      had worked for Camden Council for more  than  14  years  and  owned  a
      property in the UK and earned a salary of ï¿½38,800. She  also  accepted
      that the Claimant did have sole responsibility for the Claimant's care
      notwithstanding that they lived  in  different  countries.  The  Judge
      found that the Claimant has not been granted entry clearance under the
      Immigration  Rules  because  she  did  not  have  a   Certificate   of
      Eligibility from the Department of Education in the United Kingdom for
      the purposes of paragraph 309B of the Immigration Rules.  Although  Ms
      Cronin has submitted before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  that  the
      provisions of the Adoption with a  Foreign  Element  Regulations  2005
      applied to "prospective adopters" rather than those who  were  already
      adoptive parents, and it was argued that Ms [O] was  not  planning  to
      bring the Claimant into the United Kingdom within  12  months  of  her
      adoption such that she would not  fall  foul  of  Section  83  of  the
      Adoption and Children Act 2002, the Judge decided that the date on the
      application was in fact the 25th July 2014, and therefore  was  within
      12 months of the adoption, even though she accepted Ms [O]'s  evidence
      that the date of the Claimant's entry into the United Kingdom  was  in
      fact going to be in 2015, but found that the Entry  Clearance  Officer
      did not have that information.

   3. Judge Clark considered the unreported Upper Tribunal case of Peiris  v
      The Secretary of State for the Home Department OA/02356/2014 in  which
      case Upper Tribunal  Judge  King  TD  had  held  that  paragraph  309B
      controlled paragraph 310 of the Immigration Rules and she  found  that
      the assumption was therefore that the Rules imposed additional minimum
      requirements on those seeking to bring children into the jurisdiction,
      even when an Adoption Order was made in a country whose adoptions  are
      recognised in the United Kingdom and that therefore the Certificate of
      Eligibility still needs to be obtained even when the child had already
      been adopted overseas.  Judge Clark considered herself  bound  by  the
      Upper Tribunal decision in that regard, but went on  to  consider  the
      Claimant's claim under Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules  and
      considered and found that it was in the Claimant's best  interests  to
      live with her adoptive mother, Ms [O],  and  found  that  if  it  were
      necessary for a further assessment to be  made  for  the  purposes  of
      obtaining a Certificate of Eligibility, that it would be  unlikely  to
      be completed and entry clearance granted before the  summer  of  2016,
      during which time it was said that Ms [O]  would  have  the  difficult
      judgement of whether or not to visit her daughter and risk her falling
      ill at the prospect of further separation and as to what  arrangements
      to make for the child's schooling.

   4. Judge Clark considered that refusing the Claimant permission  to  join
      her mother in the United Kingdom would be a  grave  interference  with
      her family life, which was in her opinion all the more important given
      her abandonment by her birth parents and in light  of  the  particular
      vulnerability of the Claimant demonstrated  by  her  illness  in  July
      2014, when she anticipated separation from  her  adoptive  mother  and
      that it was inimical to her welfare to further delay her admittance to
      the United Kingdom whilst a Certificate of  Eligibility  is  obtained.
      Judge Clark found that the Entry Clearance Officer's  decision  was  a
      disproportionate interference with the Claimant's family life with her
      mother and the appeal was therefore allowed on Human Rights grounds on
      the basis of her family life under Article 8.

   5. Within the Grounds of Appeal the Entry Clearance Officer has argued in
      ground 1 that the finding by the Judge that there would be a delay  in
      response to obtaining a Certificate of Eligibility was  based  upon  a
      guess by the First-tier Tribunal Judge and  that  although  the  Judge
      referred at paragraph [19] to the decision in  the  Peiris  case,  and
      stated that she had no direct evidence from Ms [O]'s  local  authority
      as to the time it would take for an assessment to be  made  and  there
      was no reason to suppose it would be substantially different from that
      taken by the London Borough Harrow in Peiris.  It was  further  argued
      that no application  had  been  made  by  either  party  to  cite  the
      unreported case and that the Entry Clearance  Officer  it  was  argued
      within the Grounds of Appeal was not put on notice, not furnished with
      a transcript and not given the  opportunity  to  make  submissions  in
      respect of that case and that this  was  contrary  to  the  First-tier
      Practice Direction 11.  It is argued that it is for  the  Claimant  to
      demonstrate an interference with family life and not for the Judge  to
      advance that argument on her behalf.  It is further  argued  that  the
      Judge failed to take into account the fact that the delay  was  wholly
      the fault of the Sponsor and that the Claimant  and  Sponsor  were  on
      notice of a requirement to obtain an eligibility report given the fact
      that the adoption took place in December 2013 and Rule 309B came  into
      effect on the 6th September 2012.  It is argued that  the  requirement
      for an Eligibility Certificate is covered by the Rules and  cannot  be
      considered a circumstance  warranting  consideration  outside  of  the
      Rules.

   6. Within ground 2 it is argued that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did
      not have jurisdiction to make suitability findings in respect  of  the
      care to be provided by Ms [O] and that that was a discretion vested in
      the competent authority by the executive.

   7. Permission to appeal has been granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Fisher on the 6th April 2016, in which he allowed permission to appeal
      on both grounds and held that it  was  arguable  that  the  Judge  had
      engaged in speculation and that it was arguable that she had erred  in
      placing reliance upon an unreported decision when  neither  party  had
      applied to cite that decision and that it was arguable that the  Judge
      had substituted her own findings on the Sponsor's suitability and that
      she had no jurisdiction to do so.

   8. In considering this appeal, I have fully  considered  the  submissions
      made by both parties, which are fully recorded within  the  record  of
      proceedings.

   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

   9. At the start of the appeal, Ms Cronin indicated that she wish to argue
      that  the  Judge's  decision  under  paragraph  309B  was   incorrect.
      However, no cross-appeal had been submitted on behalf of the  Claimant
      in this regard, and permission had not been granted by the  First-tier
      Tribunal for her to run that argument.  Ms  Cronin  did  not  seek  on
      behalf of the Claimant for the case to be adjourned so that permission
      could be sought from the First-tier Tribunal to cross-appeal  on  that
      point, and she argued that the Claimant had specifically asked for the
      case to be expedited, and that in such circumstances  she  was  simply
      seeking to rely upon the decision of the Judge under  Article  8,  and
      was not seeking that the case be adjourned in  order  that  permission
      could be obtained from the First-tier Tribunal Judge so that she could
      pursue the potential cross-appeal on the  grounds  that  the  decision
      under 309B was incorrect.  I therefore  not  taken  into  account  the
      arguments that she wished to raise in  this  regard,  in  reaching  my
      decision.

  10. Mr Kotas quite properly conceded on  behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer that he was in some difficulties  in  respect  of  the  appeal
      given the way that the Grounds of  Appeal  had  been  formulated.   He
      conceded that having spoken to Ms Cronin, who attended at  the  First-
      tier Tribunal hearing, that in fact the  decision  of  Peiris,  was  a
      decision that the Judge herself had obtained, and was not  in  fact  a
      decision that either party had  sought  to  cite,  and  that  although
      within the Grounds of Appeal it was argued that  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer was not put on notice and not furnished with a  transcript  or
      given the opportunity to make submissions in respect of that case,  in
      fact, as Ms Cronin argued within her Rule 24 Reply the  Judge  had  in
      fact alerted the parties to the fact that she had  read  the  decision
      before commencing the  hearing,  that  she  had  risen  to  allow  the
      determination to be copied and read  by  Counsel  and  the  Presenting
      Officer and that neither party had objected at the time  to  the  case
      being considered and that there was in  fact  extended  discussion  in
      respect of the case by both parties and the Judge.  Mr Kotas  conceded
      that this had in fact happened having spoken to Ms Cronin.

  11. Although the Entry Clearance Officer seeks  to  rely  upon  First-tier
      Tribunal Practice Direction 11, that simply refers to the fact that  a
      determination of the Tribunal which has not been reported may  not  be
      cited in proceedings before the Tribunal unless:

           '11.1(a) The person who is or was the Appellant before the First-
           tier Tribunal or a member of that person's family, was  a  party
           to proceedings in which the previous determination  was  issued;
           or

           (b) The Tribunal gives permission.'

  12. It is clear from  reading  the  entirety  of  the  Practice  Direction
      including paragraphs 11.1 through to 11.6 in respect of  the  citation
      of unreported determinations,  that  although  under  11.3  permission
      under paragraph 11.1 will be given only where the  Tribunal  considers
      that  it  would  be  materially  assisted  by  the   citation   of   a
      determination as distinct from the adoption argument in the  reasoning
      to be found in the determination, it is clear that in fact here  Judge
      Clark did consider that the Tribunal would be materially  assisted  by
      reference to the determination, and this is not a case  in  any  event
      where either party were seeking to cite the decision.   In  this  case
      where the Judge had referred to the decision  herself.   The  Practice
      Direction  does  not  prevent  the  Judge   referring   to   decisions
      themselves, but clearly if a Judge is to do so,  whether  or  not  the
      decision is reported or unreported, the Judge must give the parties  a
      fair opportunity to deal with that case and  to  make  submissions  in
      respect of it.  Clearly, as was in fact accepted by Mr Kotas on behalf
      of the Entry Clearance Officer having spoken  to  Ms  Cronin  in  this
      regard, that is exactly what in fact Judge  Clark  had  done  in  this
      case.   She  had  copied  the  decision  and  given  the  parties  the
      opportunity of making submissions upon it.  It is further clear having
      read paragraph 47 of the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Clark
      that the parties were allowed to make submissions in  respect  of  the
      case,  given  that  the  Judge  states  "However,  notwithstanding  Ms
      Cronin's persuasive submissions, the adoptive parents in  Peiris  were
      in materially the same position as Ms [O].".

  13. Although the decision in Peiris v The Secretary of State for the  Home
      Department was unreported, and therefore care does need to be taken in
      respect of such a decision, and at most  it  will  be  persuasive,  if
      there is in fact no other reported authority  on  the  point,  and  no
      other reported authority on this point was seemingly  brought  to  the
      attention of Judge Clark or to myself sitting the  Upper  Tribunal  on
      this point, there is nothing within the Procedure Rules or statutes to
      prevent the Judge herself producing the same and seeking the  parties'
      submissions in respect of the case,  and  relying  upon  the  same  as
      persuasive authority in her judgment.

  14. Although Mr Kotas sought to argue that in  fact  the  Judge  erred  in
      stating that she considered herself bound by  the  decision  of  Upper
      Tribunal Judge King  in  Peiris,  given  that  it  was  an  unreported
      decision, in fact permission to appeal was not granted on  that  basis
      and that argument was not raised within the  Grounds  of  Appeal.   Mr
      Kotas did not make a  formal  application  to  amend  the  Grounds  of
      Appeal, and therefore I do not consider that  in  circumstances  where
      permission has not been granted for that argument to be run,  that  Mr
      Kotas was in a position to argue that point.  However, even  if  I  am
      wrong in that regard, any error that the  Judge  might  have  made  in
      finding that the unreported decision was  binding  upon  her  was  not
      material in any  event,  given  that  the  Judge  did  not  allow  the
      Claimant's appeal under paragraph 309B of the Immigration Rules.   Any
      error in that regard was also in fact in favour of the Entry Clearance
      Officer, rather than against him.

  15. Although it is argued by the Entry Clearance Officer  that  the  Judge
      entered into speculation, although at [49]  Judge  Clark  stated  that
      "Whilst I do not have direct evidence from Ms [O]'s local authority as
      to the time it would take for an assessment to be made,  there  is  no
      reason to suppose it would be substantially different from that quoted
      by the London Borough of Harrow.  The Appellant was adopted at the end
      of 2013 and the application for settlement was made in June 2014.   If
      it were necessary for a  further  assessment  to  be  made,  it  seems
      unlikely that this would be  completed  and  entry  clearance  granted
      before the summer of 2016.".  I do not accept the  submission  by  the
      Entry  Clearance  Officer  that  the  Judge  was  simply  engaging  in
      speculation.  The Judge clearly took account  of  the  fact  that  the
      application for settlement had been made in June 2014,  and  the  fact
      that Ms [O] was not a prospective adopter but had already undergone  a
      rigorous assessment procedure in Ghana,  and  that  although  she  was
      required under the Rules to obtain a Certificate of  Eligibility,  the
      Judge was entitled to take account of the fact that whilst she did not
      have direct evidence from Ms  [O]'s  local  authority,  there  was  no
      reason to suppose it would be substantially different  from  the  time
      taken to complete such an assessment by the London Borough of  Harrow.
      Although the Judge did not have direct evidence as to  the  length  of
      time it would take for the assessment in this case given that adoption
      involved a foreign element, the Judge  inevitably  had  to  make  some
      assessment as to the likely timeframe if the  Sponsor  was  simply  to
      make an application for a Certificate of Eligibility, and  was  in  my
      judgement, in the absence of any other evidence, entitled to say  that
      in the absence of any evidence to  the  contrary  that  there  was  no
      reason to suppose it would be substantially different  from  the  time
      that it took for a similar assessment to be completed  by  the  London
      Borough of Harrow in the Peiris case.  The Judge in my  judgement  was
      entitled to consider that  such  an  assessment  was  likely  to  take
      several months and that entry clearance was  unlikely  to  be  granted
      before the summer of 2016.  In my judgement this is a finding open  to
      her and she has not simply relied on speculation,  but  has  done  her
      best to estimate the likely period for the grant of such a certificate
      having considered how long it took for a  similar  certificate  to  be
      granted in  another  matter,  in  circumstances  where  there  was  no
      contrary evidence that in this case the certificate  could  have  been
      obtained quicker produced on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer.

  16. Further, as was properly conceded by Mr Kotas on behalf of  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer, whereas in ground 2 it is argued  that  the  First-
      tier Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to make  suitability  findings
      and that decision  was  vested  in  the  competent  authority  by  the
      executive, Mr Kotas conceded that in fact the Judge, was  entitled  to
      make an Article 8 assessment outside of the Rules and as part of  that
      to assess the care that would be provided to the Claimant by  Ms  [O].
      He conceded that it was not a question of jurisdiction, but  the  fact
      that there had not been a Certificate of Eligibility was a significant
      matter that weighed in the balancing  exercise  when  considering  the
      question of proportionality under Article 8.

  17. Again, I agree with Ms Cronin in this regard that the Entry  Clearance
      Officer has not been given permission to argue that in fact the  Judge
      got the assessment of the balancing exercise wrong  under  Article  8,
      and permission was only granted on the basis of the  original  Grounds
      of Appeal that the Judge had made a material misdirection in law  when
      considering that the Judge was able to make suitability findings  when
      that  was  a  decision  vested  in  the  competent  authority  by  the
      executive.  Mr Kotas conceded that ground of appeal was incorrect.

  18. I bear in mind that Mr Kotas did  not  formally  apply  to  amend  the
      Grounds of Appeal in this regard and that the Entry Clearance  Officer
      has not been granted permission to appeal on the new  argument  sought
      to be raised, but in any event, in my judgement given that it has  now
      been accepted on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer that the  Judge
      did have jurisdiction to consider the Article 8 claim outside  of  the
      Rules and to make an assessment as to proportionality and to  consider
      the care that was going to be given by Ms [O], I do not consider  that
      the Judge has materially erred in her assessment and that  although  I
      might have reached a different decision, had I been hearing the  case,
      the decision reached by First-tier Tribunal Judge Clark was a decision
      that was open to her on the evidence.

  19. The Judge in this regard when conducting the proportionality  exercise
      had clearly taken account of the fact that there is not a  Certificate
      of Eligibility from the Department of Education and noted specifically
      at [51] that there is a legitimate public interest in  consistent  and
      fair immigration and the need for  appropriate  safeguards  to  be  in
      place, to ensure that  children  brought  into  the  country  will  be
      properly cared for.  She has therefore taken account both of the  fact
      that there was no certificate and  of  the  public  interest  in  this
      regard, but the Judge had fully considered the  Claimant's  case  that
      the Claimant had been  abandoned  by  her  birth  mother  on  the  8th
      November 2011 and that she had been cared for in a children's home and
      that Ms [O] had applied to be approved as an adopter in Ghana and  had
      been interviewed  by  the  social  welfare  department  which  Ms  [O]
      described  as  being   a   rigorous   assessment   process   involving
      consideration of her  health,  character,  employment,  accommodation,
      earnings and her family background as well as information  as  to  why
      she wanted to be an adopter and that the Claimant had been placed with
      Ms [O] with a view to adoption and a probation  officer  had  overseen
      the placement recommended.

  20.  The Judge found and  accepted  specifically  that  the  Claimant  had
      bonded very quickly with Ms [O] at [26] and found at [27] that "It  is
      clear from the post placement report on the Appellant that her  health
      is good and that  her  development  has  improved  greatly  since  her
      placement with Ms [O] and her  current  guardian".   The  Judge  found
      specifically at [35] that Ms [O] is the sole parent for  the  Claimant
      and that Ms [O] is present and settled within the United  Kingdom  and
      that she owned a property in the United Kingdom and worked for  Camden
      Council earning a salary of ï¿½38,800 per year.  The Judge further  took
      account of the fact that although Ms [O] had not been  able  to  spend
      long periods of  time  physically  caring  for  the  Claimant  in  her
      judgement it was "abundantly clear that she is  doing  everything  she
      possibly can to  parent  the  Appellant  whilst  they  are  living  in
      different countries.  The Appellant and her mother have daily contact.
       Ms [O] chooses and pays for the nursery school  which  the  Appellant
      attends and has weekly reports from the school as to how the Appellant
      is getting on, not just educationally, but emotionally  and  socially.
      She even knows what the Appellant has for  lunch  at  school.   It  is
      clear that Ms [O] takes all the major decisions about the  Appellant's
      life, even though she is being physically cared for by Mrs  [N-S]"  at
      [36].

  21.  The Judge went on to accept and find at [37], that Ms  [O]  has  sole
      responsibility for the  Claimant's  care,  notwithstanding  that  they
      lived in different countries.   She  went  on  to  find  that  Ms  [O]
      presented as a proud  and  caring  mother  who  was  desperate  to  be
      reunited with her daughter  and  had  experience  of  raising  adopted
      daughters  outside  of  their  country  of  birth  and  had  realistic
      expectations about the challenges she may face bringing up a child  in
      these circumstances at [38].

  22. The Judge went on to find that the Claimant is a vulnerable young girl
      and accepted that she had been abandoned by her birth mother in  Ghana
      and that her anxiety at the prospect of being parted from her  adopted
      mother in July 2014 manifested itself as illness and that the Claimant
      remained at preschool with her guardian, but she was  now  of  an  age
      where it was desirable for her to start primary  school  at  paragraph
      [39].  The Judge also considered the best interests  of  the  Claimant
      and found at [50] that it was in the Claimant's best interests to live
      with her adoptive mother who loves her and is in a position  to  offer
      her the care and security she needs.  She took  account  of  the  fact
      that Ms [O] had glowing references from a variety of sources and  that
      she volunteers with vulnerable adults  so  had  been  checked  by  the
      Disclosure and Barring Service and had already  been  approved  as  an
      adopter in Ghana and had also been  approved  as  an  adopter  in  the
      United Kingdom in relation to her older daughters.  The Judge went  on
      to fully take account  of  the  public  interest  and  the  fact  that
      appropriate safeguards do need to be in place to ensure that she  will
      be brought into the country and  be  properly  cared  for,  but  found
      specifically at [51] that "In light  of  the  particular  history  and
      vulnerability of this Appellant, demonstrated by her illness  in  July
      2014 when she anticipated separation from her adoptive mother  it  was
      (and is) inimical to her welfare to further delay her admission to the
      United Kingdom whilst a Certificate of Eligibility is obtained.".   In
      such circumstances it was open in my judgement for the Judge  to  find
      that  the  decision  was  a  disproportionate  interference   of   the
      Claimant's family life with her  adoptive  mother  and  to  allow  the
      appeal on Human Rights grounds.

  23. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge H. Clark therefore does  not
      disclose a material error of law and is maintained.
