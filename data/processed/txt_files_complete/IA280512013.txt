Representation
For the Appellant:     Dr A. I. Corban of Corban Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N. Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT") Judge Goodrich, promulgated on 14  May  2014,  to  dismiss  his
    appeal against the respondent's decision, made  on  28  June  2013,  to
    refuse him leave to remain either under Article 8 of the ECHR or on the
    basis of ancestry and remove him from the United Kingdom.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Tanzania born on 21 May  1975  who  first
    entered the UK on 2 May 1999, at the age of 24, with entry clearance as
    a  student.  His  leave  expired  in  April  2000.    The   appellant's
    immigration history was summarised by the FtT as follows:

         "His leave expired in April 2000. He has since  made  a  number  of
         applications all of which have been refused. ...  It  is,  however,
         common ground that the appellant was served with IS 151 A  in  July
         2005. His outstanding student appeals were refused in July 2007 and
         no further application was made until July 2010 when he submitted a
         claim on human rights grounds and by reference to ancestry. He  had
         encountered immigration officials in May 2010 since which  time  he
         has complied with reporting requirements."

 3. The appellant's case, in sum, was that he has spent over  13  years  in
    the UK, during which time he  has  studied,  worked  and  formed  vital
    relationships. He has a fianc� with whom he has been in a  relationship
    for many years (6 years at the date of the FtT hearing).  His  siblings
    reside in the UK and he has been an  important  part  of  his  nephew's
    life. His brother was  granted  leave  to  remain  after  a  successful
    application on the basis of UK ancestry and human rights. He  does  not
    have financial resources of his own to return to Tanzania.

 4. The respondent's position, as set out in the refusal letter of 28  June
    2013, is that:

      a. the appellant does not qualify to remain the UK  on  the  basis  of
         ancestry because he  does  not  satisfy  paragraph  86(vi)  of  the
         Immigration Rules which requires an applicant to hold a  "valid  UK
         entry clearance for entry in this category" and  it  would  not  be
         unreasonable to expect him to return  to  Tanzania  to  obtain  the
         correct entry clearance should he wish to pursue this application.

      b. The appellant's  claim  to  qualify  for  leave  on  the  basis  of
         continuous residence cannot succeed because in 2005 he  was  served
         with form IS 151A (notice to a person liable to removal)  at  which
         point the clock was effectively stopped.

      c. The appellant's Article 8 claim fails under both  Appendix  FM  and
         paragraph  276ADE  and  the  circumstances  are  not   sufficiently
         exceptional to justify grant of leave outside the Rules.

FtT decision and grounds of appeal

 5. The FtT heard oral evidence from the appellant and made  the  following
    findings of fact:

      A. The appellant and the woman he claims is his fianc� are  not  in  a
         committed relationship.

      B. He has a brother, sister, nephew and niece in the UK with  whom  he
         is close and sees regularly. However, he does not  live  with  them
         and they are not financially dependent on him, or vice versa.

      C. The appellant is not married and has no children.

      D. The appellant has a continued and meaningful connection to Tanzania
         and is in regular contact with his  parents  and  sister  who  live
         there.

      E. He has adapted to life in the UK and considers it his home.

 6. Having made the above described findings of  fact,  the  FtT  concluded
    that  the  appellant  could  not  satisfy  Appendix  FM  or   paragraph
    276ADE(vi) of the Immigration Rules. The FtT also considered Article  8
    outside the rules and concluded that removal from the UK would  not  be
    disproportionate.

 7. The grounds submit that the  FtT  erred  in  assessing  proportionality
    under Article 8 ECHR by not  taking  account  of  relevant  factors  in
    favour of the appellant, in particular his age,  duration  in  the  UK,
    entitlement to apply for entry clearance on ancestry  grounds  and  the
    success of his brother in a similar appeal. They also submit  that  the
    FtT failed to follow Ogundimu [2013] UKUT 00060 in respect of paragraph
    276ADE(vi) of the Immigration Rules by not taking a rounded approach to
    the issue of ties to the appellant's home country.

 Findings in relation to Paragraph 276ADE(vi)

 8. The wording of paragraph 276ADE(vi) relevant to this appeal, and  which
    was applied by the FtT, is that which was in force between 9 July  2012
    and 27 July 2014, which provides that the applicant:

         "... is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously  in  the  UK
         for less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but
         has no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the country
         to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK"

 9. At the error of law hearing, the focus  of  Dr  Corban's  argument,  on
    behalf of the appellant, was that the FtT  had  erred  in  relation  to
    paragraph 276ADE(vi) as it had not approached the concept of "no  ties"
    in accordance with Ogundimu, which  requires  a  rounded  approach.  In
    particular, he maintained that the FtT had failed  to  give  sufficient
    weight to factors  favouring  the  appellant  such  as  his  length  of
    residence in the UK and had placed too much weight on  the  appellant's
    connection to his parents in Tanzania. For the reasons set out below  I
    do not accept these arguments.

10. In Bossadi [2015] UKUT 00042, the Upper  Tribunal  recently  considered
    the term "ties". The headnote to that case states  that  assessment  of
    "ties"

         "... requires  a  rounded  assessment  as  to  whether  a  person's
         familial ties could result in support to him in the  event  of  his
         return, an assessment  taking  into  account  both  subjective  and
         objective considerations and also consideration of what lies within
         the choice of a claimant to achieve".

11. There is also helpful clarification of  the  term  "ties"  in  Ogundimu
    where at paragraph [125] the Upper Tribunal set  out  factors  to  take
    into consideration:

         "Whilst each case turns on its own facts, circumstances relevant to
         the assessment of whether a person has ties to the country to which
         they would have to go if they were required  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom must include, but are not limited to: the length of time  a
         person has spent in the country to which he would have to go if  he
         were required to leave the United Kingdom, the age that the  person
         left that country, the exposure that person has had to the cultural
         norms of that country, whether that person speaks the  language  of
         the country, the extent of the family and friends that  person  has
         in the country to which he is being deported  or  removed  and  the
         quality of the relationships that person has with those friends and
         family members."

12. Dr Corban submitted that the FtT did not follow the rounded approach to
    an assessment of ties advocated by Ogundimu, but that, in fact, is what
    the FtT has done. Having found that the appellant came to the UK as  an
    adult  (aged  24),  that  he  has  regular  contact  and  a  meaningful
    relationship with his parents and sister who live in Tanzania, and that
    he could return to the family home, it was undoubtedly open to the  FtT
    to find that the appellant has "ties" to Tanzania and that he  was,  in
    consequence, unable to satisfy paragraph 276ADE(vi).

Findings in relation to Article 8

13. With respect to Article 8 of ECHR, Dr Corban submitted that  the  FtT's
    balancing exercise showed no indication of proper weight being given to
    the appellant's ancestry claim, length of residence and family ties  to
    the UK and too much weight being given to his immigration  status.  For
    the reasons set out below I do not accept these arguments.

14. The FtT carried  out  an  assessment  following  the  well  established
    approach set out in Razgar and, having found  that  the  appellant  had
    built up a private life in the  UK  over  the  previous  15  years  the
    interference with which would engage Article 8, proceeded  to  consider
    the proportionality of his removal. In so  doing,  the  FtT  took  into
    account that the appellant has spent many years in the UK, has ties  in
    the UK, and that return to Tanzania would be difficult for him. It also
    took into account that he may well have a valid claim on the  basis  of
    ancestry that could be made from Tanzania, as well as the impact of his
    removal on his family in the UK, including his niece  and  nephew  (who
    are both young children).  The judge weighed against  this  the  public
    interest in immigration control and concluded that the combined  effect
    of the matters in the appellant's favour were not sufficient to tip the
    scales in his favour.

15. This is a case in which there are  a  number  of  factors  weighing  in
    favour of the appellant in an assessment under Article 8(2), not  least
    the time he has spent in  the  UK,  his  connections  in  the  UK,  and
    likelihood that he would be able to make a successful  application  for
    entry clearance on the basis of ancestry. But weighing against  him  is
    that the private life he has built up in the UK was established  whilst
    he was in the UK unlawfully and that there is a strong public  interest
    in effective immigration control. As noted  by  the  FtT  at  paragraph
    [49], despite the refusal of  his  student  applications  he  chose  to
    remain in the UK when he could have returned to Tanzania  and  made  an
    application for entry clearance. Also relevant to  the  proportionality
    assessment is the FtT's finding  that  he  has  family  connections  in
    Tanzania and that there is no evidence he would have difficulty finding
    job opportunities there.

16. The FtT has adopted the proper  approach  to  Article  8,  taking  into
    account, and weighing against each other,  the  relevant  circumstances
    and it has reached a decision open to it. In particular,  the  FtT  was
    entitled to attach significant weight to  the  appellant's  immigration
    history and the public interest in effective immigration control and no
    error of law arises from it doing so.

Decision

 a. The appeal is dismissed.

 b. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of a
    material error of law and shall stand.

 c. No anonymity order is made.
