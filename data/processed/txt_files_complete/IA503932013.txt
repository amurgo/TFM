                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Tarlow (Home Office Presenting
      Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Akahao (Legal representative)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Whereas the  respondent  is  the  appealing  party,  I  shall,  in  the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.


 2. The appellant, born December 21,  1957  is  a  citizen  of  Ghana.  The
    appellant claimed to have entered the United Kingdom  on  December  22,
    2004 and in December 2010 he met the sponsor, Gifty Apoku Asiamah. They
    went through a proxy marriage on May 5, 2011 and it was  registered  on
    August 23, 2012. His sponsor  is  an  EEA  national  exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom. He applied for a residence card based  on
    his marriage.

 3. The respondent refused his application on November 17, 2013.

 4. On December 3, 2013 the appellant appealed under Section 82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and Regulation 26  of  the
    Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (hereinafter
    called the 2006 Regulations) arguing the application should  have  been
    allowed.

 5. The matter was listed before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Bart-
    Stewart (hereinafter referred to as "the FtTJ") on June 16, 2014. In  a
    determination promulgated on July 14, 2014 she found the marriage was a
    valid marriage or in the alternative she found the parties  were  in  a
    durable relationship and consequently met the Rules.

 6. The respondent appealed that decision on July 21, 2014.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hollingsworth on
    September 11, 2014. He found the FtTJ may have erred by  not  following
    the guidance set out in Kareem (proxy marriages-EU law) [2014] UKUT  24
    and TA and others (Kareem explained) Ghana [2014] UKUT 316. .

 7. The appellant and sponsor were in attendance at the hearing.


    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

 8. Mr Akahao accepted the appellant could not show a  valid  marriage  but
    maintained there was no error in law  because  the  FtTJ  had,  in  the
    alternative, found the appellant was  in  a  durable  relationship  and
    therefore was entitled to his residence card under Regulation 17 of the
    2006 Regulations because he was a family member.

 9. Mr Tarlow sought permission to challenge the FtTJ's finding on  durable
    relationship but I refused him permission. The FtTJ had considered  the
    evidence  and  had  made  specific  findings  on  this.  The  time  for
    challenging those findings was when appeal  grounds  were  lodged.  The
    FtTJ was satisfied and gave reasons for accepting the relationship.

10. In the circumstances Mr Tarlow had no further submissions.

    ASSESSMENT OF ERROR IN LAW.

11. Both parties agreed the FtTJ could not allow this appeal on  the  basis
    of the marriage. If that was the only basis the appeal was allowed then
    I would simply remake the decision and dismiss the appeal. However, the
    FtTJ set out in paragraphs [9] and [10] the evidence and  in  paragraph
    [18] he concluded-

        "I am satisfied that even if the parties  had  not  discharged  the
        burden of proof with regard to showing  they  had  entered  into  a
        customary marriage, on the balance  of  probabilities  the  parties
        have lived together in a durable relationship since 2011 as  stated
        in their respective evidence. There is no suggestion in the refusal
        letter or the submissions at the hearing that the parties were  not
        living together for at least since  the  marriage  over  two  years
        ago."

12. I am satisfied the FtTJ allowed this appeal,  in  the  alternative,  on
    that basis and consequently there is no material error. The appeal  was
    allowed on the basis he satisfied Regulation  17  albeit  not  for  the
    reasons the application was originally made.

    DECISION


13. There is no material error of law and the decision stands.

14. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.

TO THE RESPONDENT

I reverse the fee award because this appeal was not allowed on the basis it
was claimed but was granted following oral evidence. In the circumstances a
fee award is not appropriate.
