Representation

For the Appellants:    Ms O Momoh, counsel (instructed by Universal
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenny, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are husband and wife; they are nationals of  Bangladesh.
    I shall refer to Mrs Akter as "the appellant." Their  applications  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  and  her  dependant
    were refused on 3 September 2012 pursuant to Paragraph 322(1A)  of  the
    Rules. The appellants have two children, born on 25 August 2010 and  25
    February 2014 in the UK who were not joined in the proceedings.

 2. In support of her application the appellant submitted a bank statement.
      The  respondent  then  sent  the  statement  for  verification.   The
    subsequent document verification report dated 8  August  2012  asserted
    that neither the bank account referred to, nor the bank branch  itself,
    existed. The conclusion set out in the report was that the statement of
    account submitted was not a  "genuine  document".   Their  applications
    were accordingly refused.

 3. Their  appeals  against  the  refusals  were  dismissed  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge McIntosh in a determination promulgated on  15  November
    2013.

 4.  On  23  January  2013,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Chalkley  granted  the
    appellants permission to  appeal,  on  the  basis  that  there  was  no
    indication from the First-tier Judge of the standard of proof which was
    applied.

 5. At the hearing on 2 April 2013,  the  Upper  Tribunal  found  that  the
    decision involved the making of an error on a point of law. Nowhere had
    the Judge referred to the burden of proof in the assessment. It was not
    apparent from the determination itself that the Judge had proceeded  on
    the correct basis. The issue as to burden of proof in such  a  case  is
    fundamental and should not be left to an analysis of the  determination
    as a whole to conclude whether or not the Judge did err as claimed.

 6. The appeal was then listed for a re-hearing. There  have  been  several
    hearings, including adjourned hearings. The appellants' solicitors have
    unfortunately not always complied with directions with  regard  to  the
    production of a consolidated  bundle  of  documents.  This  has  caused
    inconvenience to the parties. The hearings were also stood out  as  the
    appellant was heavily pregnant. She in fact gave birth recently to  her
    second child in the UK.

 7. In addition, there have been several changes of representation on  both
    sides. It is only recently that Ms Momoh  has  been  instructed.  I  am
    indebted to both Ms Kenny and Ms Momoh for their  preparation,  and  in
    particular the identification of the essential issues in this case.  Ms
    Kenny in particular has provided a very helpful and  detailed  timeline
    setting out the various documents and reports  that  were  subsequently
    filed and relied on by both parties.

 8. An example of a further delay  resulted  from  the  production  by  the
    appellant of a copy of a letter dated 17 June 2013 purporting  to  have
    been  sent  by  the  Social  Islami  Bank.  The  respondent  wished  to
    investigate its  provenance  and  by  agreement  the  appeal  was  then
    adjourned.

 9. On resumption of the appeal on 17  September  2013,  Mr  Saunders,  who
    represented the respondent on that occasion, produced a letter  from  a
    Mr Abdul Bashet, described as the vice-president and  manager  of  that
    bank, disputing  the  authenticity  of  the  17  June  letter.  It  was
    contended that although a letter had been sent by the bank, it had been
    "modified by the applicant."

10. This resulted in the further adjournment following  an  application  on
    behalf of the appellants by Mr Mohammad in order for  enquiries  to  be
    made. This resulted in various further disputes  and  counter  disputes
    culminating in a recent  attempt  by  the  appellants  to  produce  yet
    further evidence by way of an email to the appellants  from  Mr  Bashet
    confirming that the bank held the relevant account. There was  also  an
    attempt to produce further copies of letters said to have been sent  by
    Mr Bashet  to  the  appellants.  All  this  has  tended  to  cloud  the
    identification of the relevant issues in the appeal.

11. During the course of submissions by the  parties,  which  are  set  out
    below,  it  was  finally  accepted  that  this  appeal  concerned   the
    contention by the respondent that account number 1151079896538 at  City
    Bank Ltd, Bangladesh, was an account that did not exist. In support  of
    their applications the appellant claimed to have held �200,000 in  that
    account and had submitted a letter and statements from that bank.

12. At the hearing on 18 December 2014, I refused the  appellants'  further
    application to adduce further evidence, this  time  relating  to  email
    correspondence dated 20 July 2014 from the Social Islami Bank Ltd.  The
    application was said to be pursuant to paragraph 15(2)A) of  the  Upper
    Tribunal Rules. However, the evidence sought to  be  produced  was  not
    germane to the issues which have to be decided.

13. Submissions were then made by each party.

    Submissions

14. Ms Kenny stated at the outset that the issue is whether the  respondent
    has shown that the appellant had submitted false documents accompanying
    her application. She referred to paragraph 245DD  of  the  rules  which
    provide that an applicant must not fall  foul  for  refusal  under  the
    general grounds for refusal. There must be a minimum 75 points  awarded
    under paragraphs 35 to 53 of Appendix A and the applicant must  have  a
    minimum of 10 points under paragraphs 1 to 2 of Appendix C.

15. She noted  that  the  respondent  relied  on  paragraph  322(1A)  which
    provides for the mandatory  refusal  of  the  application  where  false
    representations had been made or false documents  or  information  have
    been submitted (whether or not material to the application and  whether
    or not to the applicant's knowledge) or material facts  have  not  been
    disclosed, in relation to  the  application,  or  in  order  to  obtain
    documents from the secretary of state or  a  third  party  required  in
    support of the application.

16. Ms Kenny has set out the "timeline" in this case. The original document
    verification report dated 8 August 2012 asserted that neither the  City
    Bank account referred to nor the bank branch itself existed.

17. A "new" DVR dated 5 May 2013 was produced  before  the  Upper  Tribunal
    following a query as to the apparent contradictory assertions  made  in
    the earlier DVR by the officer concerned. He initially stated that  the
    bank representative informed him that the bank  records  indicate  that
    this account and branch does not  exist.  He  then  goes  on  to  state
    however that "... the information held by the bank differs from what is
    detailed in  the  documents  that  were  provided  in  support  of  the
    application form." As  such,  the  officer  was  "satisfied"  that  the
    statement for the account submitted was not genuine.

18. However, the initial DVR report did not  disclose  the  nature  of  the
    "information" which was in fact held by the bank. Nor is the branch, if
    any, identified. Nor was there any indication as to how the information
    held had 'differed'.

19. Accordingly, the respondent contacted the  case  worker  in  Bangladesh
    setting out the queries  that  were  raised.  The  later  report  again
    certified that the account name and the account number did  not  exist.
    The officer  contacted  the  City  Bank,  Dhaka  Chambers  Branch.  The
    representative confirmed that the City Bank, Dhaka Chambers Branch, had
    been renamed to "the City Bank Motijheel Branch" in June 2011. The bank
    representative from the City Bank Motijheel  confirmed  that  the  bank
    records indicated that this  account  does  not  exist  and  should  be
    considered as fake. It is asserted that the  information  held  by  the
    bank differs from what is detailed in the documents that were  provided
    in support of the application form.

20. The respondent has also subsequently produced a letter  sent  to  Mr  R
    Sarker, Immigration Section, at the British High Commission  in  Dhaka.
    This is dated 15 September 2013. Mr Abdul Bashet confirmed in a  letter
    to the officer concerned that the  Social  Islami  Bank  Ltd  issued  a
    certificate on bank account number 0541340005734 "....favouring  Labany
    Akter entitled to whom it may concern" under reference  SIBL  dated  17
    June 2013. It is asserted  that  the  content  of  the  certificate  as
    attached to the officer's email "seemed difference" from the content of
    the actual certificate  issued.  It  is  therefore  presumed  that  the
    content has been modified.

21. The copy of the original certificate was also  enclosed.   It  was  not
    denied however that the Social Islami Bank Ltd account was opened.

22. Ms Kenny also referred to the City Bank account statements  (pages  32-
    35) in the appellants' bundle  which  refer  to  the  account  type  as
    "savings bank - staff." She submitted that there has been no suggestion
    that either the appellant or her father had ever worked for  the  bank.
    Further, the application form and  the  passport  copy  show  that  the
    appellant's  name  is  "Akter".  The  certificate  and  bank  statement
    submitted show the name as  "Akhter".  That  discrepancy  adds  to  the
    evidence that false documents have been provided.

23. Nor had the appellant provided closing statements  from  City  Bank  or
    statements from Social Islami Bank confirming the deposits said to have
    been made on 10 June 2012.

24. Ms Kenny submitted that the two reports relating to documentation  from
    both banks, as well as the letter dated 15 September 2013  from  Social
    Islami Bank Ltd are  sufficient  to  "discharge  the  burden  of  proof
    resting on the respondent to prove  the  allegation  made  against  the
    appellant." She submitted that the appellant has 'failed to  rebut  the
    allegation' and all the subsequent letters sent by  the  Social  Islami
    Bank produced by the appellant during the course of the hearing  should
    be afforded little weight.

25. She referred to pages 29 and 35 of the  appellant's  bundle  containing
    the letter from City Bank dated 30 October 2012, which states that  the
    account was closed on 10 June 2012 on the request of the appellant  and
    her father. The closing balance on  that  date  is  the  same  as  that
    contained in the bank statement produced at page 35, showing  the  same
    amount as at 26 April 2012.

26. The respondent had thus discharged the burden of proof on  the  balance
    of probabilities.

27. On behalf of the appellant, Ms Momoh submitted that the emails from the
    Social Islami Bank Ltd explains the letter to the respondent  dated  15
    September 2013, in line with the appellants' contention  that  this  is
    inaccurate.  That  email  verifies  that  the  bank  had  provided  two
    certificates of the same date (17 June 2013) and  in  effect  retracted
    the  statement  that  the  certificate  had  been  "modified   by   the
    appellant."

28. The appellant has always denied the use of dishonesty or  deception  in
    this case. In the light of the emails submitted by  the  appellants  in
    rebuttal of the respondent's reliance on the  letter  of  15  September
    2013, the respondent had not proved her case.

29. She referred to Adedoyin v SSHD [2010] EWCA  Civ  773  with  regard  to
    paragraph 322(1A) of the rules. Dishonesty or deception  is  needed  to
    render a false  representation  a  ground  for  mandatory  refusal.  An
    allegation of forgery needs to be proved by evidence and by the  person
    making it.  She also relied on the decision in Ahmed  (General  Grounds
    of Refusal - material non disclosure) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00351 (IAC).
    There must have been the deliberate practise of deception.

30. She submitted that the  appellant  had  endeavoured  through  telephone
    calls as well as email correspondence to engage with the Social  Islami
    Bank for clarification on what was  essentially  confusion  as  to  the
    provenance of the bank certificate. Consideration of the correspondence
    from the Social Islami Bank in its entirety confirms that the appellant
    has at all material times been financially sound and solvent  and  that
    there is strong degree of 'correlating documentation'.

31.  The  allegation  that  the  appellant  submitted  a  "modified"   bank
    certificate is a serious allegation and  compelling  evidence  must  be
    produced '...beyond a defective DVR and a  letter  dated  15  September
    2013 "presuming" that the content of the certificate was modified'.

32. Ms Momoh also made specific submissions with regard to the DVR dated  5
    May 2013. The new report did not shed any light on the issue:  "....The
    same things are repeated.  There is no  attempt  to  explain  what  was
    requested".

33. In this regard she referred to the request for clarification as set out
    in a letter from Ms E Martin,  who  represented  the  respondent  at  a
    hearing on 3 June 2013. In particular, information  was  sought  as  to
    what was meant by "account and branch does not exist" as  contained  in
    the initial DVR.

34. The respondent's official was asked to provide clarification as to  the
    following: If the said branch and account do not  exist,  how  can  the
    information held by the bank officer differ from the records they have?
    What documents are being referred to when  the  bank  states  that  the
    information held by the bank differs  from  what  is  detailed  in  the
    documents that were provided?

35. Ms Momoh submitted that the information subsequently given  was  wholly
    inadequate.

36. With regard to the assertion  that  the  City  Bank  Dhaka  Branch  was
    renamed in 2011, Ms Momoh referred to the appellants'  bundle  at  page
    29, containing a letter  from  a  Senior  Assistant  Manager  dated  30
    October 2012. The City Bank Ltd address at the  head  of  the  page  is
    given as "Dhaka Chamber Branch, 65-66 Motijheel C/A Dhaka, Bangladesh."
    There is accordingly no significant discrepancy. That letter  certified
    that the appellant and her father had the closing balance relied on  as
    at 10 June 2012.  Having been provided with this document, the  officer
    should have checked this information.

37. She submitted with regard to the  reference  in  the  appellant's  bank
    statement to "staff account," that this has never been  raised  before.
    It is a matter of speculation, which could have been  cleared  up,  but
    was not. Accordingly,  the  respondent  was  not  able  to  obtain  any
    assistance from that document.

38. She submitted that the bank statement set out at A35, corroborates  the
    appellant's position as to the balance of her  account  in  April.  The
    appellant had contended at paragraph 5 of the  witness  statement  that
    her father was not happy with the banking services  of  City  Bank  and
    therefore wanted to close that account. That was done on 10 June  2012,
    after which the amount was transferred to the Social Islami Bank Ltd.

39. Ms  Momoh  also  referred  to  the  original  letter  accompanying  her
    application submitted on her behalf by Universal Solicitors.  There  it
    was asserted that the appellant had funds of �205,000 to which she  has
    her own access as a joint account holder.  Her  father  has  given  his
    consent over the full funds which are held by City Bank.  Further,  she
    is using �5,658 for her maintenance and  has  provided  the  same  bank
    statement from City Bank covering at least 90 days  or  more  from  the
    period commencing on 17 April 2011 to 26 April 2012 in  her  claim  for
    ten points.

    Assessment

40. The respondent has contended  in  the  reasons  for  refusal  that  the
    appellant submitted a false bank  statement  from  City  Bank  Ltd,  in
    Bangladesh, namely, that the account did not exist.

41. I have had regard to the evidence of  the  appellant  as  well  as  the
    substantial documentation that has been produced by both parties  post-
    dating the date of the decision. Such further evidence produced related
    to the same bank manager at the Social Islami Bank Ltd. In this respect
    there have been allegations and  counter  allegations  that  have  been
    made.

42. However, I have to ascertain whether the respondent has  shown  on  the
    balance  of  probabilities  that   the   appellant   has   made   false
    representations or  has  submitted  false  documents  (whether  or  not
    material to her application and whether or not  to  her  knowledge)  in
    relation to  the  application.  I  have  regard  to  the  documentation
    submitted as at the date of the application.

43. The respondent has the burden of proving that false documents have been
    dishonestly and deceitfully produced as part  of  the  application.  In
    this  case  the  appellants  themselves  produced  and  produced   such
    documentation. Accordingly,  it  must  be  shown  that  there  was  the
    necessary accompanying intention to deceive. Dishonesty or deception is
    needed to render a false document a mandatory ground for refusal.

44. The appellant's evidence has remained consistent throughout.  The  bank
    statement which she relied on in her application was submitted  by  the
    respondent for verification. As  noted,  the  subsequent  documentation
    verification report dated 8 August 2012 asserted that neither the  bank
    account referred to nor the branch itself existed.

45. As already noted, the report went on to state that the information held
    by the bank differed from what is detailed in the documents  that  were
    provided in support of the application form.  However,  details  as  to
    what that information was  and  how  it  supposedly  differed  was  not
    revealed. A subsequent attempt was made by  the  respondent  to  obtain
    clarifying evidence and in particular as to the alleged differences.  I
    have set out at paragraphs 33 and 34 above the questions asked and  the
    answers received.

46. In response  to  the  questions,  the  respondent  produced  a  further
    document verification report dated 5 May 2013.   With  regard  to  City
    Bank it again simply asserted that the information  held  by  the  bank
    differed from what is detailed in the documents that were provided.  It
    was confirmed that the City Bank Dhaka Chambers  Branch  had  been  re-
    named the City Bank, Motijheel Branch in June 2011.

47. It is contended that the bank statements submitted by the appellant for
    the period October 2011 until 26 April 2012 (A33-35)  referred  to  the
    bank as "the City Bank Ltd, Dhaka Chamber Branch." That  relates  to  a
    joint account held by the appellant and her father. However, the letter
    dated 30 October 2012 (A29) from the  City  Bank  had  the  address  as
    "Dhaka Chamber Branch", 65-66 Motijheel C/A Dhaka,  Bangladesh.  It  is
    accordingly still referred to in 2012 as the Dhaka Chamber Branch  with
    the address 65-66 Motijheel. It is not referred to as  the  "City  Bank
    Motijheel Branch" as asserted in the DVR report dated 5 May 2013.

48. I have also had regard to Ms Kenny's submission that the bank statement
    itself is described as "type Savings Bank - Staff." It goes on to state
    that this is a "status active" account. There is no evidence as to what
    the description "savings  bank  staff"  refers  to  or  comprises.  The
    respondent has had the opportunity to obtain evidence as to whether  or
    not  there  is  any  particular  significance  in  the  description  as
    implicitly contended by Ms Kenny. At best it is speculative. However, I
    do not find in the circumstances that this assists  the  respondent  in
    discharging her burden of proof.

49. The document verification report relied  sought  to  examine  the  bank
    statements produced.  It was asserted  in  the  report  that  the  bank
    representative informed the official who made the request on behalf  of
    the respondent, that the bank records indicated this account and branch
    did not  exist.  As  already  noted,  it  goes  on  to  state  somewhat
    inconsistently that the information held by the bank differs from  what
    is detailed in the documents that  were  provided  in  support  of  the
    application form.

50. However, as repeatedly noted, there is no clear evidence as to how  the
    information held by the bank has differed. In the later DVR dated 5 May
    2013, it simply states that the information held by  the  bank  differs
    from what is detailed in the documents that were provided  in  support.
    That is merely to repeat what had been contained in the earlier report.
    It is stated that the City Bank Dhaka Chambers Branch has been  renamed
    the City Bank Mojitheel Branch,  in  June  2011.  However,  as  already
    noted, the bank statements produced are not consistent  with  the  bank
    letter that had been sent after  the  change  of  name  in  June  2011,
    contained at A29 and 30. The letter still refers to the "Dhaka Chambers
    Branch."

51. The appellant in evidence both before the First-tier Tribunal and Upper
    Tribunal has maintained her assertion that the account at City Bank had
    been closed at the end of June 2012. There was also a  letter  produced
    from the Social Islami Bank dated 23 October 2012 confirming  that  the
    appellant had opened an account there on 23 October 2012  and  that  on
    that date, BDT 270,000,000.00 had been deposited in her name.

52. On 15 September 2013, Mr Abu Noman Md Abdul Bashet, the Vice  President
    and Manager of Social Islami Bank, Islampur Branch, Dhaka, wrote to  Mr
    Sarker from the Immigration Section at the British High  Commission  in
    Bangladesh, stating that "we would like to inform you that we issued  a
    certificate on bank account  number  05413400   5734  favouring  Labany
    Akter, entitled to whom it may concern dated 17  June  2013."  However,
    the content of the certificate  as  attached  with  Mr  Sarker's  email
    seemed different from the content of the  actual  certificate  said  to
    have been issued by the Social Islami Bank  Ltd.   Accordingly,  it  is
    presumed that the certificate has been modified.

53. However, the Social Islami Bank Ltd did not dispute  that  the  account
    had been opened "...fvg Labany Akter". There is no contention that  the
    deposit into her name had not been effected. It is not explained by  Mr
    Bashet  how  the  content  "is  seemed  difference"  from  the   actual
    certificate issued by them.

54. There have been further letters exchanged between the appellant and  Mr
    Bashet regarding that account. It has not been contended in any  letter
    that the appellant does not have the relevant amount in that account.

55. The letter from the  Social  Islami  Bank  Ltd  that  was  produced  in
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was dated 23 October 2012. This
    is a detailed letter which  confirms  that  she  has  been  maintaining
    various term deposit receipt accounts which has an equivalent value  of
    �203,374.

56. As part of the evidence accompanying the application there is a  letter
    dated 29 April 2012 from an advocate of the High Court, Mr  Iqbal,  who
    confirmed that the declaration of Mr Mohammed Mohasin, the  appellant's
    father, that the funds held in City Bank were to  be  invested  by  his
    daughter, is valid and that his signature has been verified.

57. That document was placed before the First-tier Tribunal and it  is  not
    contended that it is not authentic or in any other way suspect.

58. The appellant has maintained throughout that the City Bank account  was
    closed on 10 June 2012 and that the amount was  transferred  to  Social
    Islami Bank Ltd. However, she did  not  give  the  date  on  which  the
    transfer took place to that bank.

59. At paragraph 6 of  her  witness  statement,  dated  20  May  2014,  the
    appellant stated that  to  avoid  unwanted  complications,  her  father
    decided to give all the money to her account.  She  accordingly  opened
    six Mudaraba term deposit receipts  (MDTR)  accounts  with  the  Social
    Islami Bank and the taka were accordingly transferred into it.

60. The Social Islami Bank Ltd has written a letter dated 23  October  2012
    confirming that this occurred as at 23 October 2012.

61. As already noted, the letter from  City  Bank  dated  30  October  2012
    suggested that the funds had been transferred to Social Islami Bank  on
    10 June 2012 (A29).

62. The appellant has stated throughout, albeit not very clearly, that  the
    money had left the City Bank and has been transferred to Social  Islami
    Bank after the Citi Bank account was closed and that it had been at the
    Social Islami Bank in their joint names prior to the  transfer  to  her
    sole  account.  Accordingly,  the  letter   dated   30   October   2012
    corroborated  the  appellant's  subsequent  explanations  as   to   the
    destination of the money.

63. I also have had regard to the fact that the initial DVR was  only  made
    in August 2012. By that date, the appellant had stated that the account
    had been closed at City Bank. Accordingly, the fact  that  the  account
    was closed on 10 June 2012 did not mean that it had not existed on that
    day. Nor did it follow that there had been a "non genuine"  account  as
    asserted.

64. Having regard to the evidence as a whole, I find  that  the  respondent
    has  not  established  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  false
    documents were produced or relied on in making the application.

65. I accordingly find that the appellant has shown that she has had access
    to the funds as required. She was accordingly entitled  to  the  points
    under Appendix A. Further, I also find that she has the minimum of  ten
    points required in accordance with Appendix C.
