            Appellants

 Representation:


 For the Appellant:    Mr Z Nasim, counsel, Milestone Chambers
 For the Respondent:   Mr J Parkinson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                         DECISION AND REASONS


  1. This is an appeal against a decision of FTTJ Wyman, promulgated on  30
     July 2015.




                          � CROWN COPYRIGHT 2016





     Background


  2. The first appellant was granted limited  leave  to  enter  the  United
     Kingdom as a Tier 4 migrant until 28 June 2012. Her leave was extended
     as a Tier 1  Post-study  Worker  until  25  August  2014.  The  second
     appellant was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as  a  Tier  1
     dependent partner until 25 August 2014. The third appellant  was  born
     in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2011.  The  appellants  also  have
     another child, [IS], born in the United Kingdom on 4 March 2014. On 21
     August 2014 the appellants sought further leave to remain under Tier 1
     (Entrepreneur) of the Rules. Their applications  were  refused  on  11
     December 2014 because the Secretary of State was  not  satisfied  that
     the  first  appellant  had  genuinely  established  a  business   with
     reference to paragraph 245DD(h); that she intended to invest the money
     referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A to the  Immigration  Rules;  that
     the said money was genuinely available to her  or  that  she  did  not
     intend to take employment in the United Kingdom other than  under  the
     terms of paragraph 245DE of the  Rules.  Paragraphs  245DD(h)(i),(iii)
     and (v) were in issue. Essentially,  the  Secretary  of  State  raised
     concerns with the evidence submitted with the application;  considered
     that the appellant had not adequately prepared for running a  business
     and questioned  the  viability  and  credibility  of  the  appellant's
     business plans and market research into her chosen business sector.

  3. The appellants appealed.

     The hearing before the FTTJ


  4. The first appellant, hereinafter referred to as  the  appellant,  gave
     evidence in English. Evidence was given in  relation  to  the  matters
     referred to in the refusal letter. The FTTJ  concluded  that  she  was
     satisfied as to the provenance of the funds and that the appellant had
     been working in ASDA since graduating from  the  University  of  Wales
     with an MBA in 2012. The FTTJ found that the appellant had a "complete
     lack of business experience following obtaining her qualification" and
     concluded that the appellant's business plan was  neither  viable  nor
     credible and dismissed the appeal under the Rules. Article 8 ECHR  was
     also briefly considered, with the FTTJ  finding  that  the  appellants
     could continue their private and family lives in Pakistan.



      Error of law


    5. The renewed grounds of appeal argue, firstly that the FTTJ failed  to
       give weight to the fact that the other requirements of the Rules were
       met; secondly the grounds disagreed with what were considered  to  be
       the FTTJ's adverse finding  regarding  the  delay  in  the  appellant
       commencing  her  business;  thirdly,  it  was  said  that  the   FTTJ
       speculated; fourthly, that she failed to consider the evidence before
       her and fifthly that  the  Article  8  assessment  was  fundamentally
       flawed.

    6. Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein granted  permission;  being  persuaded
       that the first four grounds were arguable.  It was also said that the
       FTTJ appeared to have made a mistake of fact.





    7. The Secretary of State served a Rule 24 response on 27 January  2016.
       Essentially, the appeal was opposed and it was said that the  grounds
       have no merit and merely disagree with the  adverse  outcome  of  the
       appeal without identifying any arguable, material, error of law.



 The hearing


  8. Mr Nasim's submissions did not  add  materially  to  the  grounds.  He
     emphasised that the FTTJ had failed to have regard to  the  fact  that
     the appellant was awarded all point under the Rules, which he said was
     unusual. He argued that the FTTJ failed to take into account that  the
     appellant stopped working  at  ASDA  in  August  2013,  when  she  was
     expecting her youngest child. Furthermore, he argued that there was no
     reference in the Rules to having to set up a business well in  advance
     of a Tier 1 application. On the last point, he conceded that the  FTTJ
     had made no finding that the appellant had unduly delayed  in  setting
     up the business concerned.  He argued that it was irrelevant that  the
     appellant's first year of trading netted a profit of �1,500.  He  said
     that it was normal for applicants to wait until leave  to  remain  was
     granted before investing in their business. He further argued that the
     FTTJ had failed to take into account a number of positive matters,  as
     set out in paragraph 18 of the grounds. I  noted  that  these  matters
     amounted to a repetition  of  the  argument  that  the  appellant  had
     satisfied many aspects of the Rules.

  9. Mr Parkinson said that the first ground related to the weight attached
     by the FTTJ to the evidence before her, which was solely a matter  for
     her. With regard to ground 2, the FTTJ had not taken the  delay  point
     against the appellant. In relation to the small  profit,  this  was  a
     relevant issue. He added that the business in question,  a  management
     consultancy, did not require huge capital investment. In addition, the
     FTTJ noted that there was no reference to costs in the  contract;  the
     FTTJ was not required to particularise all the evidence before her and
     she had concluded that the appellant sought to embellish the relevance
     of her employment with ASDA. In closing, he said that the FTTJ was not
     wrong in noting a complete lack of business experience  and  that  the
     appellant's only employment was on the checkout. The appellant had not
     discharged the burden of establishing a genuine business.

 10. Mr Nasim had little to say in response, merely referring to  paragraph
     16 of the grounds,  which  attempted  to  explain  why  there  was  no
     reference  to  the  cost  of  services  in  the  appellant's  business
     contracts.













Decision on Error of Law


 11. At the end of the hearing, I announced that I could detect no material
     error of law in the FTTJ's decision.  My reasons are as follows.

 12. The grounds of appeal amount to no more  than  disagreement  with  the
     FTTJ's findings.

 13.  The first ground argues that the FTTJ failed to give "due weight"  to
     the aspects of the Rules which she could meet. I consider this  ground
     to be lacking in merit. What weight the FTTJ gave to this issue was  a
     matter for her. More importantly, the focus of the appeal was  on  the
     requirements of the Rules relating to the genuineness and viability of
     the business concerned.

 14. Ground 2 is misconceived, as accepted by Mr Nasim. The  FTTJ  did  not
     agree with the Secretary of State's view as to the very late start  to
     this business. At [48] of the decision, the FTTJ recognizes  that  the
     "key reason" why the appellant started her business so late  was  that
     she had given birth to her second son only in March 2014.

 15. The FTTJ at [49] noted that the annual profit of  between  �1,100  and
     �1,500 made in the first year of operating  would  not  be  enough  to
     support a family nor justify investment. Ground 3 argues that  it  was
     unfair of the FTTJ to treat these  figures  as  determinative  of  the
     "genuineness" of the business. This argument misses the  point,  which
     is that paragraph 245DD(h)(iii) also refers to the  viability  of  the
     business. In view of the minimal profit made, I consider the FTTJ  did
     not fall into error in taking this matter into account in terms of the
     viability of the business. The same ground  criticises  the  FTTJ  for
     having concerns as to the absence of any reference  to  costs  in  the
     contracts submitted with the application. The explanation for this  is
     far from clear and does not appear to have been canvassed  before  the
     FTTJ. I conclude that the FTTJ was correct in noting  the  absence  of
     vital  information  from  the   contracts   and   taking   this   into
     consideration in finding that the  appellant  had  not  established  a
     genuine business.

 16. Ground 4 contains a repetition of the first ground, about which I will
     say no more. The last ground appears to argue that the FTTJ ought  not
     to have considered Article 8 ECHR, as  an  application  had  not  been
     made. At the same time it is said that the FTTJ  failed  to  give  due
     weight  to  the  fact  that  the  appellants   met   the   substantive
     requirements of the Rules. Mr Nasim did not seek  to  expand  on  this
     ground during the hearing and I note that permission was not expressly
     granted on this matter. I find there to be  no  error  in  the  FTTJ's
     indication that there would be no  interference  in  the  private  and
     family lives of the appellants caused by their return to Pakistan.

 17. The appeal is dismissed.








Conclusion


The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the
making of an error on a point of law.

I uphold the decision of the FTTJ.


No anonymity direction was made by the FTTJ and I am aware of no reasons
for making such a direction now.
