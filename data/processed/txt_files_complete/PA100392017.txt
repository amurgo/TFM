For the Appellant:     Mr R Singer, instructed by Majestic Solicitors Ltd
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a  citizen  of  Pakistan  born  in  1985.  He  appeals
    against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Oliver,  dated  11
    December 2017,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  his
    protection claim on asylum and human rights grounds.


2.   The Appellant appeals on the grounds that the judge  erred  in  law  in
    his assessment of whether the Appellant could internally relocate.  The
    judge failed to apply the appropriate  test  of  whether  it  would  be
    unduly harsh for him to do so set out in Januzi v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department & Others [2006] UKHL 5. The judge  applied  the
    wrong  test  to  his  assessment  of  internal  relocation   and   gave
    insufficient  reasons  for  why  he  found  that  the  Appellant  could
    internally relocate. The judge's conclusion that  the  Appellant  could
    relocate to Karachi was flawed given the  evidence  in  the  background
    material to which the judge failed to make any reference.

3.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul on  19
    February 2018 on the grounds  that  it  was  arguable  that  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Oliver erred in  his  approach  to  internal  relocation
    given the particular and unusual facts of this case.

4.   In the Rule 24 response, the Respondent did not oppose the  Appellant's
    application for permission to appeal on the basis that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had not adequately considered  the  internal  relocation
    issue and invited the Tribunal to determine the  appeal  with  a  fresh
    oral continuance hearing to consider whether  the  Appellant  would  be
    able to relocate.


The Judge's Findings

5.   The judge made the following findings:


         "23. The appellant has  produced  no  witness  statement  from  his
             father or from his colleague in Dubai and  he  delayed  making
             his asylum claim for over 5 years after coming to  the  United
             Kingdom, but he has produced evidence of the  complaints  made
             by his father and has given a cogent explanation  for  why  he
             did not claim asylum sooner. I find  that  the  appellant  has
             presented a  credible  and  well  documented  history  of  the
             threats  that  he  faced  as  a  policeman  in  Pakistan.  The
             terrorist in whose name he claims that threats were made is no
             longer a threat but he claims that  Al  Qaeda  and  associated
             groups will still target him on return.  It  was  held  in  AW
             (sufficiency of protection) Pakistan [2011]  UKUT  31  that  a
             sufficiency of protection was generally available in  Pakistan
             and the respondent's country information  (June  2017)  argues
             that this is still the case.  Each case, however,  has  to  be
             considered on its own merits and I find that  as  a  prominent
             policeman, even though time has now passed, there  may  remain
             an effective threat if he returns to the  areas  to  which  he
             used to be posted. These areas, however, are all in the Punjab
             in the middle of a very large country and I find that he  will
             be able safely to relocate outside this  area  place  such  as
             Karachi, where adequate protection will be available.


         24.  At its highest, the medical evidence produced by the appellant
             is by no means sufficient to mount any claim under  article  3
             or 8.  He has no family life in the United Kingdom  and  while
             he will have developed some private life during his six  years
             in the country, his status has always been  precarious  and  I
             find he has no private life claim to  remain  under  paragraph
             276ADE of the Immigration Rules."




Submissions

6.   The Respondent accepted that the judge had made an  error  of  law.  Mr
    Singer submitted, following paragraph 7 of the Practice Statement dated
    25 September 2012, although remaking is the  normal  approach  even  if
    further fact-finding is necessary, this case should be remitted to  the
    First-tier Tribunal because the Appellant had not  had  an  opportunity
    for his case to be properly considered by the First-tier  Tribunal.  In
    this case the Appellant's account had been accepted as credible by  the
    Respondent and the only issue on appeal was whether he could internally
    relocate. The judge failed to properly apply the  correct  test  or  to
    make any findings on whether it would be unduly harsh for the Appellant
    to relocate. He merely relied on the fact that it was a  large  country
    and gave no reasons for why the Appellant could relocate to Karachi.

7.   Mr Singer  submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  been  deprived  of  an
    opportunity of a  fair  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    therefore the matter should be remitted. Ms Pal agreed  that  this  was
    the appropriate course of action in  the  particular  circumstances  of
    this case.

8.   Paragraph 7 of the Practice Statement  of  25  September  2012  states:
    Disposal of appeals in Upper Tribunal
    7.1  Where under section 12(1) of the 2007 Act (proceedings  on  appeal
         to the Upper Tribunal) the Upper Tribunal finds that the making  of
         the decision concerned involved the making of an error on  a  point
         of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside the decision  and,  if  it
         does so, must either remit the  case  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         under section 12(2)(b)(i) or proceed (in accordance  with  relevant
         Practice  Directions)  to  re-make  the  decision   under   section
         12(2)(b)(ii).
    7.2  The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to  proceed  to
         re-make the decision, instead of remitting the case to  the  First-
         tier Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½
             (a)  the effect of the error  has  been  to  deprive  a  party
                  before the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or  other
                  opportunity for  that  party's  case  to  be  put  to  and
                  considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or
             (b)  the nature or extent of any judicial fact  finding  which
                  is necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be
                  re-made is such that,  having  regard  to  the  overriding
                  objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit  the  case
                  to the First-tier Tribunal.
    7.3  Remaking rather than remitting will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary.

9.   In MM (Sudan) [2014] UKUT 105  (IAC),  at  paragraph  26,  McCloskey  J
    held: "We consider that, as a fairly strong general rule, where a first
    instance decision is set  aside  on  the  basis  of  an  error  of  law
    involving the deprivation of the Appellant's right to a  fair  hearing,
    the appropriate course will be to remit to a newly  constituted  First-
    tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing. This is so because  the  common  law
    right to a fair hearing is generally considered to rank as a  right  of
    constitutional importance and it  is  preferable  that  the  litigant's
    statutory right of appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  should  be  triggered
    only where the former right had been fully enjoyed."

10.  The only issue before the First-tier Tribunal was internal  relocation.
    The judge's findings are set out above. They are inadequate and fail to
    address the appropriate test.  I  find  that  the  Appellant  has  been
    deprived of an opportunity to have his appeal  properly  considered  by
    the First-tier Tribunal and the appropriate course, given  the  unusual
    circumstances of this case, is to remit it to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for a rehearing.

11.  I set aside the decision dated 11 December 2017 and in accordance  with
    paragraph 7.2 (a) I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal for re-
    hearing. None of the judge's findings are preserved.

Notice of Decision

The Appellant's appeal is allowed.
