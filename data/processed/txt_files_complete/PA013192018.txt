                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



                            DECISION AND REASONS



The First-Tier Tribunal refused the appeal in a decision dated 20  September
2018. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by  the  First-
Tier Tribunal on 4 October 2018. In a Rule 24 notice dated 19 November  2018
the respondent concedes an error of law and invites the  Upper  Tribunal  to
remit the appeal to the First-Tier Tribunal  for  re-making.  The  appellant
requests that the Upper Tribunal makes an error of law decision  and  remits
the appeal for re-making without need for a further oral hearing.

The error of law here concerns procedural fairness and the  appellant  being
treated as a vulnerable witness. The ground  maintaining  that  the  hearing
and decision do not appear to have taken account of the material  concerning
the appellant's young age and mental health issues is made out.  Where  that
is so, a re-making de novo is required and it is  appropriate  for  this  to
take place in the First-Tier Tribunal.


DECISION

 3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error on a point of
    law and is set aside.

 4. The appeal is remitted to the First-Tier  Tribunal  to  be  re-made  de
    novo.
