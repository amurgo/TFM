                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

    1.     Withdrawal of pending appeals is  only  possible  in  the  Upper
         Tribunal with judicial approval.  Mr  Whitwell  for  the  Appellant
         (the Secretary of State) informed the Upper Tribunal today that the
         Appellant accepted that it faced difficulties in pursuing its  case
         on  the  grounds  of  onwards  appeal  as  they  stood   that   the
         determination in the present appeal was defective.  The application
         for permission to appeal was accordingly withdrawn.

    2.     The Upper Tribunal approves such withdrawal.   This  means  that
         the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Iqbal promulgated on
         or about 29 December 2014, which allowed  the  Respondent's  asylum
         appeal, stands.

    DECISION

    Appeal withdrawn by the Secretary of State

    The original determination stands unchanged






    Signed Dated 19 February 2015


    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Manuell
    Judge of the Upper Tribunal
