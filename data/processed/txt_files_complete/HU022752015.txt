                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction


   1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh born on 12 January 1980. He
      came to the United Kingdom in 2006 with leave until May 2007. He
      overstayed. He was encountered in June 2014. He then applied for leave
      to remain and this was refused.


   2. The application was based upon his relationship with a British
      national, Ms [JH], born on [ ] 1962 and her family. They first met in
      June 2011 and a relationship began in October 2012 with the couple
      cohabiting from the 7th March 2014. In April 2014 they took part in an
      Islamic ceremony and on 31 July 2014 were married in the registry
      office. His wife has two children from a previous relationship, a son,
      [SA] born on [ ] 1982 and a daughter, [AA], born on 19 July 1985. It
      was indicated that the latter has health problems and the appellant
      helps look after her children.

   3. Two refusal letters had been issued. The first was dated 31 October
      2014 and considered the appellant situation under appendix FM. It was
      accepted that he and [JH] were in a genuine and subsisting
      relationship but that the application did not meet the rules and could
      not succeed under EX 1(b). The second refusal letter is dated the 26
      June 2015 and was issued following further representations.

   4. In the second refusal the respondent was not satisfied that [JH] was
      his partner in that no marriage certificate had not been provided and
      there was no evidence to show they had been living together in a
      relationship akin to marriage for at least two years. Because of this
      the respondent did not go on to consider EX1.

   5. Regarding paragraph 276 ADE the appellant had not been here the
      necessary time and it was not accepted there were significant
      obstacles his reintegration into Bangladesh.

   6. The respondent did not see any exceptional circumstances justifying
      leave outside the rules. Regarding his partner's daughter the
      respondent said that she could obtain assistance from the local
      authority or her brother or other relatives. It was pointed out that
      the appellant had overstayed and it was considered his return would be
      proportionate. The country information indicated that the economy in
      Bangladesh had improved and the appellant had shown he was resourceful
      and should be able to obtain employment there.


The First tier Tribunal.

   7. His appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Gribble on 2
      December 2015. In a decision promulgated on the 21 December 2015 his
      appeal was dismissed.


   8. First-tier Tribunal Gribble heard from the appellant and [JH]. [JH]
      was in employment, earning a gross salary of �10-�12,000 per year. The
      judge found that they were in a genuine and subsisting relationship
      and had lived together since at least March 2014. Consequently, as the
      requirements of the rules were not met EX1 (b) was considered. The
      judge was referred to the Scottish Inner House decision of Mirza -v-
      SSHD [2015]CSIH 28 and raised the Court of Appeal decision of Agyarko
      -v-SSHD [2015] Civ 440.

   9. The judge considered the possibility of [JH] going to live in
      Bangladesh. Whilst there was reference to her having asthma there was
      no medical evidence to suggest this should be problematic for flying
      or living in Bangladesh. The judge also noted that she was currently
      employed full-time in a supermarket. Although there would be a
      language barrier and cultural differences the judge saw no reason why
      she could not find work there. She also had the support of the
      appellant's siblings in Bangladesh. The judge also commented on her
      relationship with her adult daughter. It was accepted that she did
      things for a daughter and grandchildren but there was no evidence that
      they were reliant upon her. The judge referred to Sales J at paragraph
      21 of Agyarko -v-SSHD [2015] Civ 440:

         The phrase "insurmountable obstacles" as used in this paragraph of
         the Rules clearly imposes a high hurdle to be overcome by an
         applicant for leave to remain under the Rules. The test is
         significantly more demanding than a mere test of whether it would
         be reasonable to expect a couple to continue their family life
         outside the United Kingdom.

The Upper Tribunal

  10.  Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczec on
      8 August 2016 on the basis it was arguable that First-tier Tribunal
      Gribble erred in the assessment of insurmountable obstacles.


  11. At hearing I heard that [JH]'s daughter has three children aged 12, 7
      and 4 and her son has four children. I was referred to the medical
      problems her daughter had which were said to be deteriorating. The
      situation was compounded by a history of alcohol abuse. It was
      submitted this would justify a remaking of the decision.

  12. In response, Mr McVeety submitted that no error had been identified.
      It was unreasonable to expect the judge to anticipate deterioration in
      [AA]'s condition. It was pointed out that her mother was able to work
      full-time and this suggested her daughter had a degree of
      independence. Her poor health was acknowledged at paragraph 37 of the
      decision with the judge finding no dependency sufficient to establish
      a family life between the appellant and [AA].

Consideration.

  13. I have considered the decision as a whole. The judge clearly sets out
      the factual background and makes appropriate findings. The judge
      reached conclusions on the appellant's relationship not only with [JH]
      but with the extended family.


  14. The judge considered the meaning of insurmountable obstacles. The
      judge was referred to Mirza -v- SSHD [2015]CSIH 28. This concerned a
      Pakistani national who had overstayed and married a British citizen.
      She had lived all her life in United Kingdom and worked in a care
      home. The requirements of appendix FM of the immigration rules for
      leave to remain could not be met. His hope lay in paragraph EX1(b) and
      the question of insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing
      outside the United Kingdom and on a free standing article 8
      assessment. Lord Eassie at paragraph 20 pointed out :


         When it comes to an assessment of proportionality, it is not
         appropriate to apply a test of whether there when it comes to an
         assessment of proportionality, it is not appropriate to apply a
         test of whether there might be an "insurmountable obstacle" to the
         petitioner's wife being able to join him in Pakistan.


  15. The challenge in the present appeal is primarily focused on how the
      question of insurmountable obstacles was dealt with and to a lesser
      extent the freestanding article 8 assessment. The existence of
      insurmountable obstacles was one relevant factor and the article 8
      assessment proportionality was not to be measured by this alone. A
      British citizen had the right to live in the United Kingdom and could
      not be required to leave the country and the possibility refusal of
      leave might lead to indefinite separation had to be considered.


  16. First-tier Tribunal Gribble referred to Agyarko & Ors, R (on the
      application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015]
      EWCA Civ 440 which made the same point as in Mirza  . The
      insurmountable obstacles test is to be approached in a sensible and
      practical, not literal way. It is a precondition of success under the
      Immigration Rules but a factor to be taken account when considering
      Article 8 outside the Rules. It is not the sole and definitive test
      outside the Rules, and a case might be found exceptional in relation
      to precarious family life even absent insurmountable obstacles.
      Paragraph 21 repeats the high threshold when applying insurmountable
      obstacles:

         The phrase "insurmountable obstacles" as used in this paragraph of
         the Rules clearly imposes a high hurdle to be overcome by an
         applicant for leave to remain under the Rules. The test is
         significantly more demanding than a mere test of whether it would
         be reasonable.

  17. It is clear that First-tier Tribunal Gribble was aware of the up-to-
      date jurisprudence and the applicable high threshold in relation to
      insurmountable obstacles. I can see no error of law in the treatment
      of EX1.


  18. The judge then went on to consider the appellant's freestanding
      article 8 rights .There was an evaluation of his family life which
      included not just his wife but the wider family circle. The judge then
      correctly referred to section 117 and set out the relevant factors. At
      paragraph 48 the judge sets out in detail the considerations and at
      part (c) sets out the help available from statutory agencies. Finally
      at (e) the options available to the appellant and his wife are raised.




  19.  I find the decision accurately sets out the facts; considers all the
      relevant issues; and correctly applies the law. I find the contentions
      raised on behalf of the appellant amount to a disagreement with the
      evaluations of the facts and the conclusions reached. This was a
      matter for the judge and no material error of law has been identified.



Decision

   I find no material error of law in the decision of First-tier Judge
   Gribble. That decision, dismissing the appeal shall stand.
