Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
An anonymity order was made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  As  this  is  an
appeal on protection grounds, it is  appropriate  to  continue  that  order.
Unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify  him  or  any  member  of  his  family.  This  direction
applies, amongst others, to  both  parties.  Failure  to  comply  with  this
direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    The Appellant appeals against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Shergill promulgated on  5  January  2017  ("the  Decision").  By  the
Decision  the  Judge  dismissed   the   Appellant's   appeal   against   the
Respondent's decision dated 16  August  2016  refusing  his  protection  and
human rights claim.  The  appeal  to  this  Tribunal  relates  only  to  the
protection claim.

2.    The Appellant is a national of Iran.  He claims  to  have  arrived  in
the UK on 26 February 2016.  He claimed asylum on that day.   The  basis  of
his asylum claim is his conversion to  Christianity  and  imputed  political
opinion due to a tattoo which  he  bears  on  his  back  stating  "Death  to
Khameni the Terrorist".  He claims that he had photographs of the tattoo  on
his computer which he says has been seized by the authorities during a  raid
on a house church meeting which he attended.  It is worth  noting  that  the
Appellant does not claim to  have  any  particular  anti-regime  sympathies.
His friend carried out the tattoo when they were drunk.

3.    The Appellant claims that he has been arrested twice.   On  the  first
occasion, in June 2014, he was arrested for walking in  the  street  with  a
female.  He says he was released after two days without charge.  The  second
occurred in April 2015, when the Appellant was working as a DJ  at  a  mixed
gender party attended by some 200 people.  Such  parties  are  illegal.   He
claims that following this arrest he was detained and raped.   He says  that
he was again released without charge.

4.    The Judge did not find the  Appellant's  claim  to  be  credible.   He
accepted that the first arrest may have occurred but did  not  believe  that
the Appellant was detained for a second time as  he  claimed.   He  did  not
therefore accept as credible that the Appellant would be of interest to  the
authorities as someone who would be thought to  have  anti-regime  opinions.
Neither did he accept as credible, the claimed conversion.

5.    The Appellant's grounds of appeal against the Decision  focus  on  the
(imputed) political opinion claim.  In short, the  Appellant  says  that  he
will be at risk on return to Iran  because  the  tattoo  will  come  to  the
attention of the authorities when he is  questioned  at  the  airport.   The
Appellant says that, irrespective of the  credibility  findings,  the  Judge
has not considered what will occur at the point of return.

6.    In fact, the majority of the Appellant's grounds focus on  a  critique
of the country guidance in SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed  asylum  seeker)
Iran CG [2016] UKUT 00308 (IAC).  That is not though on the basis that  this
case is to be distinguished or that further background  material  has  since
come to light which undermines the  decision  in  that  case.   Rather,  the
Appellant criticises some of the conclusions and reasoning of  the  Tribunal
in that country guidance case.  This is not though an  appeal  against  that
decision.  No application was made by the parties in  that  case  to  appeal
the decision.  This is not an opportunity to appeal  that  decision  by  the
back door. Country guidance is to be followed by First-tier Tribunal  Judges
absent distinguishing factors of the case  in  front  of  them  or  material
produced since that decision tending to undermine  its  conclusions.   There
is no such  distinction/additional  material  in  this  case.   Accordingly,
there could be no error of law committed by following that decision.

7.    I do not in any event need to deal with those criticisms  because  the
grant of permission limited the grounds of appeal  on  which  permission  is
granted.  Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson  on
18 April 2017 in the following terms so far as relevant:-

      "[3]  A reading of the Judge's decision as a  whole  renders  it  [is]
      arguable that the Judge did not assess credibility in the  round  (for
      examples �43,45,48,50-51 & 62 of the decision).  It  is  incorrect  to
      indicate that the Judge did not consider risk on return on account  of
      the presence of the appellant's tattoo, whatever the  motive  for  its
      creation might have been (� 63 of the decision).  However,  it  is  of
      concern that the Judge concluded that there is  a  "low  risk  of  the
      appellant  being  detained  for  further  inquiries  immediately  upon
      return". It is far from clear whether the Judge  was  indicating  that
      there was no real risk, or otherwise.  There is no  substance  in  the
      contention that the Judge erroneously sought to  follow  the  relevant
      Country Guidance.  Permission is granted on grounds (1)-(2)  and  (4),
      those grounds revealing arguable errors of law."

There has been no renewal  of  the  grounds  on  which  permission  was  not
granted.

8.    Since the grounds are not clearly headed,  it  is  worth  setting  out
those  grounds  on  which  I  understand  (and  Mr  Nicholson  agreed)  that
permission was granted:-

      "[4]  However, the FtTJ rejected the importance of the tattoo  because
      of a "concern...that A has put himself in a position of harm in  order
      to amplify the chances of him being successful in this claim"  (48)  -
      and, it is submitted, because the FtTJ had already  rejected  what  he
      himself had set up to be "pre-cursor events" (42)

      [5]   It is submitted that both of these  approaches  were  in  error.
      The evidence was required to be addressed in the  round,  rather  than
      using any doubts about A's detention and rape  against  the  evidently
      existing tattoo.  Conversely, it might have been found in A's  favour,
      that his first arrest made it more likely that his  second  also  took
      place.  The FtTJ doubted this because, much as  R  often  puts  it  in
      refusal letters, he believed  A  would  not  have  undertaken  "risky"
      behaviour once again, a year later (38).  It is submitted that  people
      do not always behave logically  (especially,  as  noted  by  the  FtTJ
      himself, when drunk), and people all over the world do undertake risky
      behaviour, whether for reasons which are religious, political or  just
      for sheer entertainment.

      [6]   [ground three: permission not  granted]  Moreover,  A  has  this
      tattoo.  It clearly poses a risk to  his  safety  on  return.   It  is
      submitted that the FtTJ was required to consider A's  account  at  the
      hearing, as if he were to be returned immediately thereafter - when he
      would of course still have this tattoo.

      [7]   In addition, it is  submitted  that  A  runs  the  risk  of  ill
      treatment when he is questioned and, almost inevitably, detained as  a
      result, on return to Tehran Airport."

9.    I turn then to consider whether the Decision does  disclose  an  error
of law and depending on my reasons for so doing to  either  give  directions
for a resumed hearing in this Tribunal or remit to the  First-tier  Tribunal
for re-hearing.

Decision and reasons

10.   Mr Nicholson's first submission is that the Decision does  not  follow
any coherent path and as a result the evidence has not  been  considered  in
the round.  He drew my attention to [50] of the  Decision  where  the  Judge
appears to reject the Appellant's motivation for having the  tattoo  because
he did not believe the Appellant's account  as  to  the  second  arrest  and
detention.  I  reject  that  submission.   As  Mr  Bates  pointed  out,  the
Decision  considers  the  claim  in  chronological  order  of  events.   The
reference  to  the  previous  finding  when  considering   the   Appellant's
motivation for the tattoo is followed in the same paragraph  by  an  express
self-direction that the conclusion is based on all the evidence.

11.   The second point made is that the Judge has misunderstood some of  the
evidence and the findings made were  not  therefore  open  to  him  on  that
evidence.  The points made in oral submissions are only tangentially  raised
by the grounds but I heard submissions  on  these  points  and  I  therefore
consider them.  Mr  Nicholson  said,  first,  that  because  the  Judge  had
believed the Appellant as to the first arrest, he should have been  inclined
to believe the second arrest.  He drew an analogy  with  the  approach  that
past persecution may be an indicator of a risk of future persecution.   That
is to my mind a false analogy.  That is considering the assessment  of  risk
and not the assessment of the facts of a claim.  It is often the  case  that
part of a claim is capable of belief on the evidence  but  other  parts  are
considered to be an embellishment because they  do  not  stack  up  on  that
evidence due to inconsistencies or implausibility.  That is  the  case  here
unless the Appellant is able to persuade me that  the  Judge  erred  in  the
consideration of the evidence.

12.   The first point which  Mr  Nicholson  makes  is  that  the  Judge  has
misunderstood the evidence about how the photograph of the tattoo found  its
way to the Appellant's computer based  on  what  is  said  at  [45]  of  the
Decision.  Mr Nicholson said that the finding  is  based  on  the  Appellant
having actively "uploaded" the picture being inconsistent with what he  said
later about being passive ie not directly involved  in  the  uploading.   In
effect, Mr Nicholson's submission is that this is so minor as not to  amount
to any inconsistency and is simply a point of  terminology.   However,  read
in context, there  is  no  error.   The  Judge  was  entitled  to  draw  the
distinction between the Appellant himself having put the photographs on  his
computer and others having done so.  As the Judge rightly  observes  at  the
end of that  paragraph,  the  point  of  greater  import  from  the  Judge's
perspective is that the Appellant did nothing about it.

13.   Of greater significance are the  Judge's  findings  about  the  second
arrest, detention and rape.   Mr Nicholson was  similarly  critical  of  the
Judge's reasoning for rejecting that part of  the  Appellant's  account.   I
have already indicated why I reject his submission that belief in the  first
arrest should go some way to belief in the second.  I  also  note  that  the
additional points made about the findings relating to the second arrest  and
detention  cannot  be  said  to  have  been  raised  in  the  grounds   even
tangentially.  There is no reference at all to the  Judge's  findings  about
the second arrest and detention, other than the point that  the  credibility
finding on the first arrest should have led to a positive finding about  the
second and a rather speculative assertion about the  Judge's  finding  based
on patterns of behaviour as appears at [38] of the  Decision.   I  can  deal
with that point shortly.  Whilst the drafter of the grounds might  be  right
that some individuals would not change behaviour to avoid risk for  personal
reasons, in this case that has to be read against the  Appellant's  evidence
that, so scared was he of further arrest after the  first  that  he  changed
his  appearance  and  behaviour.   No  issue  is  taken  with  the   Judge's
interpretation of that evidence as cited at [38].

14.   Mr Nicholson's submission however was rather founded on [30]  to  [32]
of the Decision and the differences in the various  accounts  given  by  the
Appellant.  Mr Nicholson submitted  that  those  were  not  differences  but
rather a greater degree of detail being  given  in  later  statements.   The
Judge has however, considered whether that is the reason for what  he  views
as differences at [31] of the Decision.  He goes on to  explain  however  at
[32] to [36] of the Decision  the  discrepancies  between  the  versions  of
events and why that gave the Judge cause not to believe  this  part  of  the
Appellant's account.

15.   For those reasons, I reject the submissions  made  about  the  Judge's
findings.  Those are not though the reason permission to  appeal  was  given
in this case.  That reason is rather linked to the assessment of risk.   The
submission about this can be summarised thus.  Even accepting  that  SSH  is
rightly decided (as Mr Nicholson accepted he must for current purposes),  Mr
Nicholson said that the  Judge  has  failed  properly  to  assess  the  risk
factors in this case.  Those are as follows:-
    . Illegal entry
    . Claim of asylum
    . Detention for anti-regime behaviour
    . Discovery of tattoo depending on what would occur as a result  of  the
      first three.

16.   Mr Bates submitted that the Judge's findings on  risk  are  adequately
contained in [63] of the Decision.  The  Judge  does  not  accept  that  the
Appellant will be questioned other than administratively.  The Appellant  is
found not to have a sufficiently significant profile for the authorities  to
take more interest.  Accordingly the tattoo will not come to  the  attention
of the authorities.

17.   The Judge has clearly taken into account at  [61]  the  issue  whether
illegal exit would cause the authorities to take particular interest in  the
Appellant.  He rejects that, based on the country guidance  because  "he  is
likely only to come to attention of the authorities if there is  some  other
profile".  As the Judge there rightly  observes  "The  other  profile  would
arise  if  I  accept  the  evidence  about  either  of  the   previous   two
detentions."  He goes on to recognise that  there  are  two  issues,  namely
whether the Appellant  has  been  detained  at  all  and  whether  any  past
detention would attract further enquiries.  The Judge observes  at  [62]  of
the Decision that he has some misgivings about whether the first arrest  and
detention did occur at all based on his findings about the second but,  even
accepting it did, he finds that "There is  seemingly  nothing  controversial
about the first arrest."  Whilst the  Appellant  would  no  doubt  criticise
that finding because, on Mr  Nicholson's  submission,  the  arrest  was  for
"anti-regime behaviour", the fact remains that the  Appellant  was  released
without charge and was,  as  the  Judge  described  it,  "dealt  with  in  a
relatively low-key manner."   Those were findings which  were  open  to  the
Judge on the evidence.

18.   Dealing then with the risk arising from the tattoo,  the  Judge  dealt
with it thus:-
           "[63] As a  standalone  issue,  I  am  satisfied  to  the  lower
           standard that if the first arrest did  happen  that  this  alone
           would not merit a level of inquiry upon his  return  that  would
           lead to any  persecution.   It  is  difficult  to  second  guess
           whether there would be a total disregard of any previous arrest.
            As such if there was any form of  enquiry,  I  have  considered
           whether  this  would  lead  to  the  tattoo  being   discovered.
           Presumably it depends on the nature of the questioning.   If  he
           was detained for more than a day or so  he  would  naturally  at
           some point end up with his  shirt  off  when  washing,  changing
           clothes  etc  such  that  someone  may  see  the  tattoo.    The
           likelihood is that he will only be questioned  administratively.
           On the evidence I have before me, considering all of the aspects
           of the case and looking at the state of the  case  law,  I  have
           concluded that there is  a  low  risk  of  the  appellant  being
           detained for further inquiries immediately upon return.   If  he
           was questioned by immigration officials there is no evidence  or
           obvious reasons that his body would be physically examined in an
           ordinary interview (having rejected the accounts of  the  laptop
           and second arrest etc).  The low  risk  only  arises  if  he  is
           detained beyond a day or so."

19.   As Judge Hodgkinson observed  when  granting  permission,  it  is  not
clear whether the continual reference to "low risk" is intended to mean  "no
real risk" or that there is some risk.  Mr Bates  understandably  encouraged
me to find that this is what the Judge meant.  There is  not  a  risk  of  a
sufficient probability to reach the threshold of being a "real  risk".   The
difficulty comes in reading that  paragraph  with  what  follows  under  the
heading of "Mitigation of Risk" namely that the "low risk" could be  reduced
to "no risk" by the removing of the  tattoo.   Whilst  the  Judge  might  be
entitled to note that the Appellant has no genuine  political  belief  which
would make it important to him to keep the tattoo, if the Judge intended  to
find that there is no real  risk  that  the  Appellant  would  come  to  the
authorities' attention such that  the  tattoo  would  be  discovered,  there
would be no need to deal with this  point  at  all.  Further,  although  the
Judge concludes at [71] of the Decision in appropriate language  that  there
is no real  risk  of  ill  treatment/persecution  on  return,  that  imports
necessarily what comes before it, namely the Judge's consideration that  the
risk could be mitigated by the Appellant having the tattoo removed.

20.   For those reasons, and not without some considerable reluctance  based
on what is otherwise a very well-reasoned  Decision,  I  conclude  that  the
Decision does contain an error of law when considering the  risk  on  return
but only on that issue.  Mr Nicholson encouraged me to remit the  appeal  if
I found an error of law since credibility is in issue and the setting  aside
of the Decision will necessarily involve consideration  of  the  Appellant's
profile in the context of what is found about his past.  Mr Bates  submitted
that there is no need to do so in this case  if  I  find  no  error  in  the
credibility  findings.   Having  considered  those   submissions,   I   have
concluded that it is appropriate to remit the appeal.   Whilst  I  have  not
found errors in the First-Tier Tribunal Judge's  assessment  of  credibility
of the Appellant, another Judge considering risk on return will  undoubtedly
need to determine that risk following  an  assessment  of  what  he  or  she
accepts as being  the  Appellant's  profile.   I  do  not  for  that  reason
preserve any findings of fact.

DECISION

I am satisfied that the Decision involves the making of a material error  on
a  point  of  law.  The  Decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Shergill
promulgated on 5 January 2017 is set aside.  The appeal is remitted  to  the
First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing before a different Judge.
