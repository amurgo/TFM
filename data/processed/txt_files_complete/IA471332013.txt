                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr R Singer, counsel, instructed by S Satha & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant appeals a decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which
      dismissed his appeal against a decision of the respondent to refuse to
      issue him with a residence card as an extended family member of an EEA
      national  in  accordance  with  Regulation  8(2)(a)  and  (c)  of  the
      Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (the  "EEA
      Regulations").


   2. Permission to appeal had  been  granted  on  the  basis  that  it  was
      arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had failed to have  regard
      to material evidence relating to the appellant's financial  dependency
      and  had  acted  unfairly  in  making  adverse   findings   concerning
      membership of the EU family member's household  without  enabling  the
      appellant to give oral evidence in connection therewith.

      Background

   3. The appellant claims that he was supported financially by his uncle, a
      German citizen, whilst in Sri Lanka although funds were sent  for  him
      to his father rather than direct to him. The appellant started work in
      Sri Lanka in 2007 after his father had  a  heart  attack.  His  father
      returned to work after 6 months but was not able to  work  full  time.
      The appellant is recorded as  having  conceded  that  had  his  father
      continued working his income would have been sufficient to support the
      whole family "up to a point" but that money was needed  for  education
      for his sister. The  appellant  is  recorded  as  accepting  that  the
      uncle/sponsor sent money for the whole family but it  was  partly  for
      him as part of the family.


   4. The appellant came to the UK on 22nd August 2010; his uncle  continued
      to send money to his father. The appellant lived with other  relatives
      when he first arrived in the UK and said he started  living  with  his
      uncle in September 2012. He  is  recorded  as  saying  that  prior  to
      September 2012 he was financially  assisted  by  other  relatives  but
      after September 2012 his uncle provided him  with  financial  help  in
      cash. The appellant earns �800 per month and  is  recorded  as  saying
      that he looks after his family in Sri Lanka and if  he  did  not  send
      money to Sri Lanka the money he is earning would be sufficient because
      he is living with his uncle.


      Error of law

   5. In paragraph 21 the First-tier Tribunal judge sets out the evidence he
      has  considered  with  regard  to  the  financial  dependency  of  the
      appellant upon his uncle. He refers to the "only documentary evidence"
      he has of money being sent is "by the admission of both the  appellant
      and his uncle purely for the purposes of his student visa  application
      and therefore does not comprise "essential needs" as  defined  in  the
      European Casework Instructions." The judge was "not satisfied  on  the
      balance  of  probabilities  that  [the  appellant]   has   ever   been
      financially dependant upon his uncle for his essential needs."


   6. In paragraph 22 the judge refers to discrepancies in  the  address  ie
      letters and documents being sent to the appellant at 204a Archway Road
      and to his uncle at 204 Archway  Road  and  states  that  he  has  "no
      documents addressed to [the uncle] at 204a Archway Road, but  only  to
      204 Archway Road". The judge does not accept that  the  addresses  are
      interchangeable stating "According to the  appellant,  his  uncle  has
      been living at 204a Archway Road since at least September 2012 and yet
      there is absolutely no documentary evidence to this effect. There  are
      numerous documents he could have produced such as  tenancy  agreement,
      various utility bills,  council  tax  statements  etc  but  absolutely
      nothing has been produced in this respect. His uncle may well  have  a
      shop at 204 Archway Road but I am  not  satisfied  anywhere  near  the
      balance of probabilities that he resides at 204a Archway Road....I  am
      most definitely not satisfied that they are  living  together  in  the
      same household."

   7. Ground 1 is essentially that the judge failed to have regard  to  four
      Western Union payments dated 12th February 2008 (�105); 18th July 2008
      (�110); 31st July 2009 (�100) and 21st September 2010 (�80) which were
      "significant evidence in that it corroborates the appellant's  account
      that his uncle was making frequent payments to his father in Sri Lanka
      to help them in meeting their "essential needs".  It  is  also  argued
      that the payment on 21st  September  2010  was  corroborative  of  the
      appellant's oral evidence that one of the payments was  made  for  the
      purpose of paying for his father's operation, which took place on 21st
      September 2010.

   8. Ground 2 is that it was only in submissions  that  the  appellant  was
      made aware that the judge considered that the  addresses  of  204  and
      204A were  not  interchangeable  and  that  they  were  not  given  an
      opportunity to address this. The ground asserts that the judge  placed
      little weight on the explanation given by counsel for the appellant.

      Ground 1

   9. The judge states in [21]
                  "There is evidence that [the  uncle]  sent  funds  to  the
                  appellant's father in the sum  of  �2000  in  March  2008,
                  �4,500 in August 2009, and �2500  in  June  2010.  However
                  apart from the three Western Union money transfer receipts
                  send (sic) over a period of just two  years  there  is  no
                  other independent  evidence  of  any  funds  sent  to  the
                  appellant or his  family  in  Sri  Lanka  other  than  his
                  mother's letter to which I do not attach great  weight  as
                  it is clearly in the family's interest that the  appellant
                  succeeds  in  his  appeal.....In  fact  the  appellant  at
                  paragraph 11 of his witness stamen states that  the  three
                  sums of �2500, �2,000 and �4,500  "all  went  towards  the
                  fees for my student visa and my course". Therefore none of
                  these funds were used for any medical bills and  there  is
                  no evidence whatsoever that the uncle has paid any medical
                  bills. There are no bank statements from  the  appellant's
                  father showing receipt of any other funds from abroad that
                  may have been from the appellant's  uncle.  The  appellant
                  claims that he was only earning Rs.4,000  per  month  from
                  his employment with the communications centre but there is
                  no evidence of this and  it  is  just  as  likely  he  was
                  earning considerably more and was financially independent.
                  Again there is no documentary evidence to  show  that  his
                  father ceased work for six months and  then  resumed  work
                  only for 2 or 3 days per month. The appellant's uncle also
                  confirms that  the  three  Western  Union  transfers  were
                  solely for the purpose of  the  appellant's  student  visa
                  application. He states that he sent other money  transfers
                  but did not keep the receipts as he thought he would never
                  need them. Quite simply I only have the oral  evidence  of
                  the appellant and his uncle and the written  statement  of
                  the appellant's mother  that  the  appellant's  uncle  has
                  supported their family for a number of years  dating  back
                  to 1989 when  he  first  went  to  Germany  but  there  is
                  absolutely    no    documentary    evidence    of     this
                  whatsoever......The only documentary evidence  I  have  of
                  money being sent to  the  appellant's  family  is  by  the
                  admission of both the appellant and his uncle  purely  for
                  the purposes of his student visa application and therefore
                  does  not  comprise  "essential  needs"  ......I  am   not
                  satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he has ever
                  been dependent upon his uncle for his essential needs. The
                  only evidence I have is that in effect his uncle sponsored
                  his student visa application, which I do not interpret  as
                  being within the definition of "essential  needs".  As  it
                  was conceded by Ms Walker at the beginning of the  hearing
                  that the appellant was not relying  upon  being  from  the
                  same household as his uncle in Sri Lanka. He clearly fails
                  to satisfy point iii of the headnote to Dauhoo."

  10. There is  no  challenge  to  the  finding  that  the  meeting  of  the
      appellant's student visa  fees  and  course  fees  is  not  "essential
      needs".  The judge in his findings has clearly  not  referred  to  the
      four Western Union payments referred to  in  paragraph  7  above.  His
      findings that "there is absolutely no documentary evidence"  that  the
      uncle has supported the family appears to be an error of fact.


  11. Mr Singer submits that the last payment, made on 21st September  2010,
      was to pay for the father's medical bill and this was  evidence  given
      by the appellant. There is no medical  bill  to  that  effect  in  the
      bundle before the judge but  there  is  a  "Diagnosis  Ticket"  for  a
      'lateral sphincterotomy' on 21  September  2010  for  A.  Rajarathnam,
      discharge on 22 September 2010 (page 19 appellant's bundle). There are
      medical bills  for  an  appendectomy  for  R.  Mouradaas  (also  spelt
      Mayurdaas) between  31  July  2009  and  3  August  2009  which  total
      somewhere in the region of Rs68,000 (pages 15-18 appellant's  bundle).
      There is a diagnosis of recurrent tonsillitis for Mast. R Myuradas  on
      23 August 1999 to  25  August  1999  but  no  medical  bill  (page  13
      appellant's bundle). There is a diagnosis ticket for A  Rajarathna  15
      December to 18 December 1998 for headache and neurological examination
      but no medical  bill.  There  is  a  description  of  a  complaint  of
      umbilical discharge for Mayuradas on 1 October  1993  but  no  medical
      bill (page 9 appellant's bundle).

  12.  The uncle, in his witness statement says that he

        "...always tried to help [the family] by sending  them  money  when
        they have asked, although I  have  not  always  had  money  and  so
        sometimes it was  not  possible.  I  was  able  to  send  money  to
        Mayurathas' father in 1989 when his bus was destroyed but I  cannot
        recall how much money it was that I sent back. I would try and send
        lump sums of money when I could, perhaps once every  three  to  six
        months  (although  there  was  no  fixed  pattern)   for   everyday
        essentials such as food. I know that it was difficult for my wife's
        family to support themselves financially.  Mayurathas'  father  did
        not earn that much money as a driver and he had three children  and
        a wife to support. I have also previously sent one off payments  to
        Mayurathas' family to pay  for  medical  bills...I  know  that  the
        appellant and his father were able to pay for part of  the  medical
        bills but they could not afford to pay for it all and I  was  happy
        to help.



  13. The appellant in his witness statement says  that  the  Western  Union
      payment made on 31 July 2009 was for his medical fees.  The  appellant
      refers to his father having a  heart  attack  in  2007  and  thus  not
      working full time; there  is  no  medical  evidence  of  this  and  no
      reference to this in the witness statement of the uncle. There  is  no
      reference in the uncle's witness statement to the claimed reduction of
      working by the father after the heart attack or whether  and  to  what
      extent the uncle  sent  additional  money  for  essentials  given  the
      reduction in income of the family. In oral  evidence  the  uncle  said
      that when he sent money to Sri Lanka that was for the whole family and
      not merely for the appellant himself. He said that he no  longer  sent
      money to Sri Lanka since the appellant was in the  UK.  The  appellant
      said that he now sends money to his family in Sri Lanka.


  14. Although in his record of the evidence before him and the submissions,
      the judge refers to the assertion that the uncle  sent  money  to  the
      family and that this therefore included the  appellant  and  thus  the
      appellant was dependent upon him and that this was  evidenced  by  the
      four Western Union receipts, the judge has not referred to this in his
      conclusions as to dependency in Sri Lanka.

  15. It is however inconceivable that the  judge  could  have  reached  any
      other conclusion than that which he reached namely that the  appellant
      had never been dependent upon  his  uncle  for  essential  needs.  The
      evidence before the judge amounted to confirmation  that  two  medical
      bills were met and two other sums of money were  sent.  There  was  no
      independent evidence of the appellant's earnings  in  Sri  Lanka,  the
      family's costs in Sri Lanka, the reduction  in  the  father's  income,
      that the father had even had  a  heart  attack  (despite  there  being
      other, older, medical  records  produced).  Western  Union  would,  if
      asked, have produced a schedule of payments made since February 2008 -
      of the receipts that were produced all  were  made  through  the  same
      agent. But no such schedule was before the judge.  Ms  Walker  in  her
      submission had stated that the average wage in Sri Lanka  was  between
      Rs6,500 and Rs7,000 per month and that the appellant's income  in  Sri
      Lanka was at best RS6000 but his  basic  was  Rs4000.  Even  if  those
      figures are accepted as correct (and the judge makes  the  point  that
      all  were  not  evidenced  by  way  of  documentation)  there  is   no
      documentary evidence or even oral evidence of any shortfall in  family
      income such that  essential  daily  needs  of  food,  fuel  and  other
      household necessities could not have  been  met  without  the  uncle's
      financial support. Two of the Western  Union  receipts  appear  to  be
      directly referable to medical  costs.  Dauhoo  [2012]  UKUT  79  (IAC)
      considering the issue of dependency makes clear  that  the  burden  is
      upon the appellant to show dependency. [16] of Dauhoo states


             "...It should  be  recalled  that  in  Ihemedu  (OFMs-meaning)
             Nigeria [2011] UKUT 340 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held that:
                  "If an applicant chooses not to apply from abroad  for  a
                  family permit under  reg  12  of  the  2006  Regulations,
                  thereby denying the  UK  authorities  an  opportunity  to
                  check documentation in the country concerned,  he  cannot
                  expect any relaxation in the burden of proof that applies
                  to him when seeking to establish an EEA right"
             17....By having afforded the  British  post  in  Mauritius  no
             opportunity to receive and  check  documentation  relating  to
             dependency, and having chosen to travel to the UK instead (and
             eventually to apply from here), the appellant could not expect
             the judge to  overlook  a  lack  of  satisfactory  documentary
             evidence  just  because  he  was  able  to   produce   witness
             statements and witnesses."


  16. Leaving aside the respondent's  assertion  that  monies  sent  to  the
      father do not amount to monies upon which the appellant  is  dependent
      for his essential needs, there is, quite simply  a  lack  of  evidence
      before the judge that could have resulted in  a  different  conclusion
      being drawn.


  17. Therefore, even though the judge has overlooked the four Western Union
      receipts in drawing his conclusions as to financial dependency in  Sri
      Lanka, I find that this does not amount to an error of law  such  that
      the decision be set  aside.  The  decision  is  neither  perverse  nor
      irrational.


      Ground 2

  18. The judge, for completeness, considered whether the applicant and  his
      uncle formed part of the same household here in the UK.  He  does  not
      accept  that  the  addresses  of  204  and  204A  Archway   Road   are
      interchangeable and draws attention to the lack of evidence  that  the
      uncle resides at 204A. Complaint is made that this  should  have  been
      raised by the judge at the hearing and to fail to enable the appellant
      and his uncle to give evidence on this issue amounts to  a  breach  of
      the common law duty of fairness. I do not agree. The judge  heard  and
      took account of Ms Walker's submission  as  regards  this  issue.  The
      appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was  specifically  upon  the  ground
      that the appellant was a member of the uncle's household whilst in the
      UK. The uncle's evidence was that he moved into the 3 bedroom flat  at
      204A Archway Road in 2012 when the other tenants  moved  out  and  the
      appellant joined him there. Although the appellant  produced  evidence
      of admission to the electoral register  and  bank  documents  to  204A
      there was not one single piece of independent evidence that the  uncle
      was living at that address despite  his  witness  statement  and  oral
      evidence being to the effect that he paid utility bills and  rent  and
      he does not ask the appellant for a contribution.  Such  documentation
      would plainly have been available  to  him.  It  was  clear  from  the
      reasons for refusal of the residence permit that  the  respondent  did
      not accept that the appellant was a member of the uncle's household in
      the UK.  This  was  not  an  issue  raised  only  during  submissions.
      Furthermore counsel for the appellant did not, when the judge referred
      to this during her submissions, request  an  adjournment  or  for  the
      appellant and/or his uncle to be recalled to  give  further  evidence.
      The judge was entitled to  reach  a  decision  on  the  basis  of  the
      evidence before him, which is what he did.


  19. Even if ground 1 were made out, the appellant and his  uncle  are  not
      members of the same household. There is no error of law in the judge's
      findings.

  20. I should mention that having looked at the documents that were  before
      the judge very carefully I have noted that one of  the  Western  Union
      documents dated 21st June 2010 for �2,500 gives the  sender's  address
      as 204A Archway Road. I do not consider this to  be  relevant  to  the
      issue before either the First-tier Tribunal judge or me  -  that  date
      pre-dates the date the appellant arrived in the UK and  pre-dates  the
      date on which the uncle claims to have started living at 204A  Archway
      Road (sometime in 2012). This document was not drawn to  my  attention
      or, it appears to the First-tier Tribunal judge  and  was  not  relied
      upon by the appellant. It does not in any event alter the findings  of
      the judge as to the total lack of documentary evidence of the  uncle's
      claimed residence at 204A Archway Road from sometime in 2012.

  21. During the course of the hearing before me I indicated to both parties
      that the word "continuous" in  the  regulation  may  impact  upon  the
      appellant's claim in any event. I note that Dauhoo considers  this  in
      [12]. I heard no argument from either party with regards to  this  and
      make no finding. A view as to this is not relevant  on  the  facts  of
      this appeal (and I have taken no view), but it may  be  that  at  some
      point in the future further consideration may be given to that concept
      given the underlying purpose of the Directive.



          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

     I do not set aside the decision

     The decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge stands.
