Representatives:

For the Appellant: Mr C Emezie (Solicitor, Dylan Conrad, Kreolle)
For the Respondent: Mr L Tarlow (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellants are a mother and son and nationals of Nigeria. They
   entered the UK on the 17th of October 2004 on visit visas, the Second
   Appellant did not leave but the First Appellant left and returned in 2005
   but does not appear to have left since then. There have been previous
   proceedings but the instant applications were made on the 26th of June
   2013 on form FLR(O). They were refused on the 20th of December 2013.

2. The Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. Their appeals were
   heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Oakley at Hatton Cross on the 28th of
   May 2014. In his determination of the 28th of May 2014 he dismissed the
   appeals under the Immigration Rules but allowed the appeals under article
   8 of the ECHR.

3. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal in an application of
   the 20th of June 2014. It was submitted that having dismissed the
   applications under the Immigration Rules the Judge then erred in the
   approach taken to article 8 and Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct
   approach) [2013] UKUT 60 and that the Judge had applied a near-miss test
   contrary to Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261. Permission was granted by First-
   tier Tribunal Judge Pirotta on the 3rd of July 2014.

4. The finding made in respect of the Immigration Rules is set out in
   paragraph 20 in which the Judge stated of the Second Appellant "With
   regard to 275ADE(v), whilst he is over the age of 18 and under the age of
   25, he had not, at the time of the application, which was made on the 9
   September 2013, spent half his life continually in the United Kingdom."
   Reasons were given in the following paragraphs.

5. The appeal was allowed under article 8. At paragraph 27 the Judge found
   that the Appellant and his mother did not have a family life that engaged
   , which was made on the 9 September 2013, spent half his life continually
   in the United Kingdom." Reasons were given in the following paragraphs.

6. The appeal was allowed under article 8. At paragraph 27 the Judge found
   that the Appellant and his mother did not have a family life that engaged
   Kugathas as "there is no family life between them, other than the normal
   emotional ties of a mother and son..." In paragraph 28 it was found that
   article 8 was engaged, presumably on the basis of private life.

7. In paragraph 30 the Judge stated "I will first of all deal with the
   Second Appellant who only just failed to establish that he could satisfy
   Rule 276ADE(v) and if indeed I had been entitled to consider the matter
   as at the date of the appeal he would have satisfied this part of the
   rule. That near miss is significant so far as the Second Appellant is
   concerned. I also accept that the Second Appellant has spent at least
   half his formative years in the United Kingdom and no longer has any
   siblings living in Nigeria and has never had any benefit of working in
   Nigeria and would have been quite young when he spent the first 10 years
   of his life living there with his mother." Paragraph 31 states "Taking
   all those factors into account, I conclude that it would be a
   disproportionate decision to remove the Second Appellant."

8. The First Appellant's position was considered in paragraphs 32 and 33.
   It was noted that she had only spent 10 years in the UK living in a
   Nigerian household and attending a church with a Nigerian pastor. There
   was no evidence of family connections in Nigeria. In paragraph 33 the
   Judge found that as the First Appellant had been living with the First
   Appellant in a family unit and his removal would be disproportionate the
   effect on the Second Appellant would make her removal disproportionate.

9. The position of the Secretary of State is set out in the application for
   permission to appeal submitting that the Judge had not properly assessed
   the compelling factors in the case. It had not been established that
   there were arguably good grounds to consider the Appellants circumstances
   outside the rules. In addition the Judge had applied a near-miss approach
   contrary to the decision in Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261.

10. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal the grounds were briefly
   amplified and the chronology of events clarified. I was told that the
   Second Appellant was born on the 8th of January 1994, that the Appellants
   had entered the UK on the 17th of October 2004 (on visit visas) and that
   the application under appeal was made on the 26th of June 2013.

11. It follows that the Second Appellant was aged just over 10� (10 years,
   9 months and 9 days to be exact) when he entered the UK on the 17th of
   October 2004. I was told that he has not left the UK since and proceed on
   that basis. The application was made on the 26th of June 2013 which is 8
   years, 8 months and 9 days later. At the date of the application the
   Appellant was aged just over 18�, at the date of the hearing he was aged
   just under 19�. By the date of the hearing on the 28th of May 2014 he had
   been in the UK for 9 years, 7 months and 12 days. On the 28th of May 2014
   he was aged 20 years, 4 months and 20 days. By my calculations he had not
   spent half his life in the UK by the time of the hearing.

12. For the Appellant it was submitted that the grounds were misconceived.
   Although the Appellant had not cross appealed or submitted a rule 24
   reply (funding issues being the explanation) it was submitted that the
   Judge was wrong to have found that the Second Appellant did not meet the
   Immigration Rules as section 85(4) of the 2002 Act and the cases of YZ
   and LX (effect of section 5(4) - 2002 Act China [2005] UKAIT 00157 and DR
   (Morocco) indicated and if the Appellant satisfied the rules at the date
   of the hearing the Judge would have to take that into account.

13. Mr Emezie also submitted that the Judge had not relied on a near-miss
   in finding for the Second Appellant. The Judge had followed Gulshan and
   it was suggested that the findings could only be attacked if they were
   irrational which was not raised in the Secretary of State's application.
   The findings in paragraph 32 followed the oral evidence and were
   sufficient to be insurmountable obstacles or unreasonable.

14. Paragraph 276ADE states "(1). The requirements to be met by an
   applicant for leave to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK
   are that at the date of application, the applicant:...
      (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent at
least half of his life
      living continuously in the UK (discounting any period of
imprisonment)."

15. Section 85(iv) of the 2002 Act provides: "On an appeal under section
   82(1), 83(2) or 83A(2) against a decision the Tribunal may consider
   evidence about any matter which it thinks relevant to the substance of
   the decision, including evidence which concerns a matter arising after
   the date of the decision."

16. The case of YZ and LX concerned an appeal relating to paragraph 317 of
   the Immigration Rules. That paragraph set out the requirements to be met
   for dependent relatives to be admitted to the UK but made no reference to
   the date on which matters were to be assessed. It was an in-country and
   so in the absence of any contrary provision was to be assessed at the
   date of the hearing, that was the result of the decision of the Tribunal.
   DR (Morrocco) relates to the effect of section 84(5) to out of country
   decisions where the date of the decision is the date at which matters
   have to be assessed.

17. The wording of paragraph 276ADE(iv) requires that an appellant's
   circumstances be assessed "at the date of application". That wording is
   clear and unambiguous. Section 85 has no bearing on the date at which the
   Appellant's circumstances are to be assessed, that is determined by the
   wording of the rule under consideration and whether the appeal is in or
   out-of-country. In this appeal to meet the requirements of paragraph
   276ADE the Second Appellant had to show that at the date of the
   application he was between 18 and 25 and had been in the UK for at least
   half his life, the Judge was right to find that he did not and to dismiss
   his appeal under the rules. There is no suggestion that the First
   Appellant met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

18. The approach taken by the Judge to article 8 is however open to
   criticism on a number of grounds. The first is that he could only
   consider article 8 if the Appellants' circumstances were sufficiently
   compelling and not sufficiently recognised by the rules. This is
   underlined by the case of Shahzad (Article 8: legitimate aim) Pakistan
   [2014] UKUT 85 (IAC) which supports the approach taken in Gulshan.

19. The fact is that the Appellants' circumstances were recognised under
   the Immigration Rules, the Appellants did not meet the requirements of
   the rules. Failure to meet the requirements of the rules is different
   from a lacuna in the rules, here the rules allow for lengthy presence in
   the UK from an early age and so I find that the Appellants' situation was
   met by the rules. There was nothing unusual about the circumstances of
   the Appellants that could be said to be compelling either, there are no
   health issues or other facts out of the ordinary that would require
   further consideration of the appeals.

20. There is also an issue with respect to the Judge's approach to family
   life. There is an irreconcilable contradiction between the finding in
   paragraph 27 that there is no family life between the Appellants beyond
   the normal emotional ties, following Kugathas, and the finding in
   paragraph 33 that the effect of the removal of the Second Appellant would
   make removal of the First Appellant disproportionate. In the light of the
   finding in paragraph 27 his position has no bearing on the First
   Appellant's position.

21. Finally in paragraph 30 of the determination there is an error in
   relation to the Second Appellant's position in respect of his failure to
   meet the requirements of the rules. The phrase "that near miss is
   significant" is clearly an error as that approach has been deprecated in
   Miah for clear reasons.

22. For reasons given above the Judge applying Gulshan could not properly
   have proceeded to consider article 8 but even if that was permissible the
   reasons given for allowing the appeal were not permitted by the case and
   on that basis the decision cannot stand.

23. Having considered the submissions that were made I am satisfied that
   the circumstances of the Appellants' appeals were such that they were
   properly refused under the Immigration Rules and that there was no basis
   for considering their position outside the rules. The evidence discloses
   no circumstances that are not considered within the rules and

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal dismissing the appeal of the
Appellants.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.



Fee Award

In dismissing the appeal I make no fee award.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
