By virtue of this appeal  relating  to  the  circumstances  of  three  minor
children, it  is  appropriate  that  the  previous  anonymity  direction  is
maintained. Unless and until a Tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
appellant is granted  anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify him or any member of his family. Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS



Background to remaking decision

 1. This is the remaking of the decision in the appellant's appeal against
    the respondent's refusal of his human rights claim, a deportation order
    having been against the appellant on 17th October 2018.  This was in
    the context of the appellant being a foreign criminal, (a citizen of
    Nigeria) with his most recent criminal offending resulting in a
    sentence of imprisonment of four years, so that section 117C(6) of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applies, namely the public
    interest requires the appellant's deportation, unless the appellant
    shows that there are very compelling circumstances, over and above
    those described in 'Exceptions 1' or '2', as contained within section
    117C(4) and (5) of the 2002 Act.

 2. As noted in the error of law decision annexed to this remaking
    decision, the   appellant's claims had involved the following issues:

      a) in relation to his family life, whether the applicant has a genuine
         and subsisting parental relationship with his British citizen
         children and step-son; and

      b) if he did, whether the effects on them would be unduly harsh, if
         they had to remain in the UK without the appellant;

      c) in relation to his private life, noting that the appellant has
         never had lawful leave to remain in the UK, beyond a claimed
         initial visit visa, long-since expired, whether there would be very
         significant obstacles to his integration into Nigeria, his country
         of origin;

      d) and noting both his family and private life, whether there were
         very compelling circumstances over and above those described in
         Exceptions 1 and 2. As a serious foreign criminal, the appellant
         may refer to the circumstances described in those two Exceptions,
         or features falling outside the circumstances described in those
         Exceptions, to the extent that they make his claim based on Article
         8 especially strong, so as to amount to very compelling
         circumstances.

 3. In refusing the appellant's human rights claim, the respondent
    considered the appellant's convictions (all involving offenses of
    dishonesty), the most recent of which had resulted in a conviction in
    2017 and a sentence to imprisonment for four years, for conspiracy to
    defraud and money-laundering. The sentencing Judge had described as the
    appellant  as being at the "centre of this conspiracy", playing a
    "leading role" in the fraud which was "highly sophisticated," over a
    "sustained period", with a "large number of victims;"  which the
    appellant had been able to perpetrate as he had inside knowledge of the
    corporate victim, Southern Rail, as one of its former employees, so
    there was an abuse of a position of trust.  The respondent did not
    accept, in her refusal decision, that the appellant had a genuine and
    subsisting relationship with his children; he was no longer in a
    relationship with his former partner, the children's mother; and there
    were no very significant obstacles to the appellant's integration in
    Nigeria, noting that he had never had leave to remain in the UK (having
    worked in the UK unlawfully and having obtained work through use of a
    false British birth certificate).

 4. In a decision promulgated on  4th  October  2019,  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Chana (the 'FtT'), dismissed the appellant's appeal  against  the
    respondent's refusal of his human rights claim.

 5. The appellant appealed and I allowed the appeal for the reasons set out
    in the annexed decision, which it is unnecessary to repeat, suffice  it
    to say that the FtT's decision was set aside, without  preservation  of
    any finding of fact.  I concluded that it  was  appropriate  to  retain
    remaking in the Upper Tribunal, given the narrowness of  the  scope  of
    the issues  as  they  had  developed  since  the  respondent's  initial
    refusal.

The issues in this appeal

 6. I identified and agreed with the representatives the  legal  issues  in
    dispute in this case, which, as noted above,  had  narrowed  since  the
    appeal before the FtT.

 7. The respondent now accepted  that  the  appellant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental  relationship  with  his  step-son,  'O;'  and  his
    biological children, a son, 'A' and a daughter, 'C,' albeit he was in a
    non-resident relationship  with  them.  All  children  were,  and  are,
    minors.  The respondent further accepted that it would be unduly  harsh
    for the children,  all  British  citizens,  to  live  in  Nigeria,  the
    appellant's  country  of  origin,  noting  their  specific  needs   and
    vulnerabilities, and the fact that their mother,  'MD'  had  indefinite
    leave to remain in the UK and was no longer in a relationship with  the
    appellant. The respondent therefore accepted  that  what  is  sometimes
    termed the 'go option' was not viable, but the option of  the  children
    staying in the UK with MD without the appellant (the 'stay option') was
    not, in the respondent's view, unduly harsh.

 8. The core questions, for the purposes of family life, were whether:

      a) the effects of the 'stay option' (for the children to remain in the
         UK without the appellant) was unduly harsh; and beyond that;

      b) whether there were very compelling circumstances, by virtue of  the
         individual complexity and seriousness of the childrens' needs;  and
         the fact that all three children had such needs.

      c) While the issue of whether the effect  of  the  'stay  option'  was
         unduly harsh should be without  reference  to  the  nature  of  the
         appellant's offending, when coming on to consider  very  compelling
         circumstances, the length of sentence beyond  four  years  and  the
         nature of the offences (which were not  violent  or  drugs-related)
         needed to be considered, as did the impact on MD to be able, alone,
         or  with  professional  help,  to  look  after  the  children;  the
         appellant's claimed rehabilitation and lack of  further  offending;
         and the lessened weight  of  the  public  interest  in  immigration
         control in light of  the  respondent's  failure  to  deal  with  an
         earlier application in 2007 for leave to remain, for over a decade.



 9. In relation to the appellant's private life,  the  respondent  accepted
    that notwithstanding his offending,  the  appellant  was  socially  and
    culturally integrated in the UK, but disputed that  he  met  the  other
    criteria of Exception 1 - he had been in the UK, even on his  own  case
    since 1992, for less than half of his life and had never had  leave  to
    remain in the UK. An issue remained of whether there were  nevertheless
    features of  his  private  life,  particularly  the  obstacles  to  his
    integration in Nigeria and his earlier application for leave to  remain
    in  the  UK,  made  in  2007,  which  amounted   to   very   compelling
    circumstances.

The hearing before me

10. The first day of the hearing took place on 31st July  2020,  via  Skype
    for Business, (I attended from Field House) but for the reasons set out
    in my order adjourning the hearing, I had to relist the remaking for  a
    resumed hearing.  As recorded in the order, it was necessary for me  to
    overcome a number of issues during the first day of the  hearing  which
    were unrelated to technology. The first was that the appellant had  not
    been provided with a copy of his witness  statement  resulting  in  the
    appellant's Counsel, Ms Griffiths, having to show him a copy over Skype
    for the appellant to read and adopt.  Second, MD,  the  other  witness,
    had also not been provided with a copy of her  witness  statement  and,
    without criticism of her,  her confidence in her ability to  read  even
    via Skype was limited such that it became necessary for me to read  out
    loud both statements  and  confirm  their  accuracy  with  her.  I  was
    satisfied that the appellant was able to give oral evidence,  on  which
    he was cross-examined via Skype, but when it came  to  MD  giving  oral
    evidence, whilst initially the communications were adequate, it  became
    increasingly difficult to hear what she was saying  and  such  were  my
    concerns I concluded that a fair hearing to consider the  remainder  of
    her evidence was no longer possible. As a consequence, I adjourned  the
    hearing for her to be able to attend to give evidence in person,  which
    she did on the second day of the hearing.

11. Whilst arrangements were made for MD to attend the second  day  of  the
    hearing alone, with the appellant looking after their children at  MD's
    home, on the second day of the  hearing,  both  MD  and  the  appellant
    attended in person and gave oral evidence. The appellant applied  under
    Rule 15(2A) of the  Upper  Tribunal  Rules  to  adduce  a  supplemental
    witness statement by way  of  update,  to  which  Mr  Howells  made  no
    objection.

Documents

12. The respondent provided a bundle ("RB") which included the  appellant's
    immigration history; the sentencing marks of HHJ Clarke QC and  various
    correspondence from the appellant's representatives in mitigation;  and
    the appellant provided two bundles which included the  appellant's  and
    MD's  initial  witness  statements  (there  were  further  supplemental
    statements); and, loose a report of an independent  social  worker,  Dr
    Rukshana Farooqi, whose expertise was unchallenged.

13. I also had the benefit of two focused  and  cogent  skeleton  arguments
    produced by Ms Griffiths and Mr Howells.



The appellant's submissions

14. I set out below excerpts from Ms Griffiths' skeleton argument:

         59. The starting point in relation to the Article 8 claim is  that
             he has had extensive private and family life in  the  UK.  The
             Appellant has been in the UK for around 27 years.  His  family
             unit includes two British children and a step-child  for  whom
             he has been the only father figure.

         60. Very compelling circumstances above the  exceptions  exist  in
             this case, on the basis of the following factors (individually
             and when viewed in combination):

               i) The Appellant's British children and step-son.

              ii) The nature of the Appellant's offending

             iii) The Appellant's rehabilitation

              iv) The Appellant's private life in the UK

               v) The SSHD's delay in determining his application for  leave
                  made in 2007

         The Appellant's family life with his children

         61. There are three children within the Appellant's  family  unit,
             now aged 17, 13, 11. Whilst two are biological, the other  the
             Appellant has been involved in raising since 2005, when he was
             2 years old and he is a father figure to him [MD2/2].  Section
             55 clearly  applies  to  any  child  affected  by  the  SSHD's
             decision and in Article 8 claims all family members' article 8
             rights.

         ...

         65. A primary consideration in this  regard  should  be  the  best
             interests of the children, and it has been held in the case of
             Sanade [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC) at �95 that it where a child is
             a British citizen and therefore  a  citizen  of  the  European
             Union, it is not possible to require them to relocate  outside
             of the European Union or to submit that it would be reasonable
             for them to do so. Remaining in the UK with  both  parents  is
             plainly in the interests of these children.

         66. As to the children remaining in the UK without the  Appellant,
             it is submitted that in the particular  circumstances  of  the
             Appellant's family would amount to undue harshness  more  than
             simply unreasonableness. In particular, the Tribunal is  asked
             to have regard to the following:

               a. The ages of his children (10 and 13) and his stepson  (17)
                  and the critical stage at  which  they  are  at  in  their
                  personal development. They are said to require "consistent
                  stable and secure parenting" [ISW � 52].

               b. Prior to his imprisonment, the Appellant had  been  living
                  with them within the  family  unit  together  He  has  now
                  resumed daily contact which albeit not  living  with  them
                  amounts to a considerable part of the time when  they  are
                  home. They have therefore now resettled into  family  life
                  together.

               c. The Appellant does not only have a subsisting relationship
                  with his children, but one  with  a  significant  role  in
                  making decisions about their lives and meeting  their  day
                  to day needs.

               d. The  Appellant's  deportation  will  effectively  end  the
                  prospect of meaningful family life continuing between  the
                  children and their father,  which  cannot  effectively  be
                  maintained  through  modern   means   of   technology   or
                  communication.

               e. The fact that  the  children's'  mother  was  been  forced
                  temporarily to care for them alone is not indicative of  a
                  long term ability to do so. The children have unique  care
                  needs not common with other families.

               f. Rather, the children plainly require co-parenting by  both
                  their mother and the Appellant:

                   i. Each of the  children  individually  require  a  high
                      level of care.

                  ii. C has at least since 2012 had a Statement of  Special
                      Educational  Needs  [ASB/2]  C  also   suffers   from
                      Epilepsy  and  has  history  of  recurring   seizures
                      [ASB/15] which have begun since  December  2018.  She
                      therefore has additional medical needs which  require
                      attending the GP. Her records show that  despite  her
                      age, she cannot  dress  herself  and  has  difficulty
                      waiting [ASB/81].  She  requires  adult  support  and
                      structure [ISW � 33].

                 iii. Correspondence from A and C  school  in  2014  states
                      both children were part  of  Learning  provision  for
                      children with autism or global delay [RB/D4]

                  iv. As above, O has significantly delayed development  in
                      English   speaking   and   understanding   and    had
                      significant difficulty with most of the tests carried
                      out  [ASB/22].  Despite  his  age  he   cannot   live
                      independently [ISW �29] and  is  supervised  even  at
                      home.

                   v. A's Positive and Proactive Support Plan shows concern
                      over A feeling comfortable with those he  works  with
                      and needing "clear  and  firm  boundaries"  [ASB/12].
                      Similar concerns are reflected in his Annual Progress
                      Report in June 2019 [ASB/28].  His  mother  expresses
                      she has difficulty managing him  and  relies  on  the
                      Appellant to do so [MD2].

                  vi.  They  are  each  in  different  schools   and   have
                      individual one to one needs. A in particular  attends
                      a special educational needs school  [name  redacted].
                      It is extremely difficult for their mother  alone  to
                      be at all three when needed, and support the family.

                 vii. Plainly these factors impact  on  a  single  parent's
                      ability to manage all three.

                viii. Also, the children also have large physical frames as
                      noted by  the  ISW  [�46-48].  C's  latest  Education
                      Health and Care plan specifically identifies high BMI
                      as an issue needing recognition by those who  support
                      her [ASB/97]. This is particularly relevant given the
                      children's growing ages and size  and,  from  a  risk
                      perspective, their mother's  difficulty  in  managing
                      aggressive behaviour [�46].

                  ix. Extended School Leader [name redacted]  explains  the
                      needs of family support for the children's mother  in
                      managing them.

                   x. The ISW  report,  whereby  the  author  observed  the
                      Appellant with his family remarks  how  the  children
                      were demanding but set boundaries by him  [�25];  the
                      author was left in no doubt as to the level  of  care
                      they need and  the  need  of  both  parents  to  work
                      together;  that  the  children  required  supervision
                      [�27]; that based on the observations,  it  would  be
                      very difficult for the children's mother to manage on
                      her own [�38]; it is very important for them to  have
                      routine, structure and stability [�42].

                  xi.   The   fact   that   all   three    children    have
                      developmental/learning disabilities  is  particularly
                      relevant and each requires their own one-to-one care.
                      This is very different from a family with no or  even
                      one child with special needs.

                 xii.  Furthermore,  the  ISW  opines  that  A's   physical
                      presence is needed to help with the needs, discipline
                      and supervision [�45].

               g. After being apart for a period, they  have  now  reunited.
                  Permanently separating  them  again  would  cause  further
                  instability to them which their conditions plainly  affect
                  their ability to cope with change. For example, C requires
                  a "familiar adult" and 'clear and consistent' routines  to
                  support her [ASB/97; ISW �44-45; ASB/88].

               h. There is limited  alternative  support  available  to  the
                  children's mother in his absence. She will be  rendered  a
                  single parent and the lack of  alternative  support  means
                  that [MD]  would  have  to  substitute  for  the  paternal
                  support provided by  him.  As  the  ISW  report  explains,
                  alternative support would need to be live-  in/residential
                  and it be difficult for the children to tolerate  it  even
                  if it were available [�49].

         Offending

         67.  Whilst  in  no  way  seeking  to  minimise  the   Appellant's
             offending, the seriousness and circumstances of his offence is
             a relevant consideration for the purposes of  considering  his
             article 8 case:

               a. The Appellant received a sentence of  4  years,  which  is
                  precisely on the threshold for the purposes of  s.117B(6).
                  Whilst it is accepted that this does not affect  the  test
                  to be applied, it does affect how factors are  weighed  up
                  in determining  whether  "very  compelling  circumstances"
                  above the exceptions are present. It should not be treated
                  akin to a sentence of 10 years for example.

               b. The Appellant's offence was non-violent. Whilst of  course
                  it was  a  serious  offence,  there  was  no  personal  or
                  psychological harm caused to members of the public. Within
                  financial crime offences, it was also not, for example, an
                  offence which financed further illegal  activity  such  as
                  drug trafficking.

               c. Without seeking to excuse his offending, the Appellant has
                  set out in detail  his  circumstances  at  the  time.  His
                  circumstances if  the  appeal  is  allowed  will  be  very
                  different not least because if granted leave A  will  have
                  permission to work legally and support himself, and

               d. The Sentencing Judge,  having  allocated  the  Appellant's
                  offence to a category, sentenced him at the starting point
                  of that category.

         Rehabilitation

         68. The Appellant is remorseful for the circumstances giving  rise
             to his deportation. The overall tenor of the evidence provided
             by the professional evidence is that of someone who has learnt
             lessons and committed not to fall into a similar situation  as
             that which resulted in his conviction:

               a. The Appellant pleaded guilty to his offences and  received
                  maximum credit.

               b. He has no further convictions nor is there any  indication
                  of non-compliant behaviour

               c.  In  addition  to  the  activities   he   has   undertaken
                  demonstrate a low risk of re- offending and commitment  to
                  preventing the same issues arising again.

               d. The OASys assessment of his  reoffending  is  clearly  low
                  [AB/40] and he is said to pose low risk to all categories.
                  He is also an enhanced prisoner [AB/44]

               e.  The  report  also  states  that  the  author  was   shown
                  certificates for numerous  courses  including  Crimnon  UK
                  Condition of the work process, spreadsheet database, asset
                  skills, self esteem, equality and diversity, property  and
                  planning, personal finance, parking leaning module and  e-
                  driver.

               f. He also participated in the Centre for Criminology Reading
                  group [AB/58]

               g. The executive director of Crimnon  UK  states  "[AEB]  has
                  completed our Accredited Restoring Self-Respect Course and
                  four other courses covering a wide range of  subjects.  He
                  has completed all courses to a very high standard  and  is
                  working through another of our courses...  He  has  always
                  worked  to  the  highest  standard  possible,  has   shown
                  intelligence and excellent literacy in his  work.  He  has
                  applied himself, showing a desire for personal improvement
                  [AB/59]

               h. His probation  worker  in  February  2020  notes  that  he
                  attends  appointment  and  has  engaged   in   supervision
                  sessions; has "presented well" and is trying  to  move  on
                  from his part [ASB/119]

               i.  The  Appellant  has  also  now  begun  volunteering   for
                  Detention Action [ASB/120].

         69. The Appellant's evidence for the purposes of this appeal isn't
             merely that he is remorseful and promises to  rehabilitate  in
             the future. Rather, he has  demonstrably  shown  that  he  has
             already rehabilitated through the work that he has undertaken,
             and the valued  member  that  he  has  become  of  the  prison
             community, using his time productively.

         70.  A  fundamental  principle  which  underpins  the  fact   that
             deportation is in the public interest, is the effect  that  it
             has on  deterrence.  Correspondence  from  Oxfordshire  County
             Council/HMP  Huntercombe  Library  manager   refers   to   the
             Appellant's contribution to the group including writing  about
             the difficulties  facing  prisoners,  and  being  involved  in
             debates appreciated for their "honesty and integrity" [AB/60].
             His positive impact,  his  commitment  to  education  and  his
             enhanced status can be applied in the  community  pursues  the
             same legitimate aim of deterring violence and crime and  being
             a positive contribution to society.

         71. This is  directly  relevant  to  the  balancing  exercise  the
             Tribunal must undertake  in  terms  of  proportionality  (with
             reference to UE(Nigeria) which states that the  weight  to  be
             attached to the public interest is not  some  fixed  immutable
             amount). RA v SSHD [2019] UKUT 123 did not  detract  from  the
             point raised  in  Forrester  v  SSHD  [2017]  EWCA  2653  that
             rehabilitation and good word record with  evidence  of  reform
             can be a factor on  which  it  is  open  to  the  Tribunal  to
             determine the appeal.

         Private life

         72. The Appellant has established a considerable private  life  in
             the UK. Time spent in prison does  not  necessarily  break  an
             offender's  social  and  cultural  and  the  evidence  of  his
             integration to the UK demonstrates that it is not tenuous:

               a. The Appellant has resided in the UK  since  1992  [RB/B98-
                  B11,] He has lived in the UK nearly  half  his  life  even
                  though not most of it (he has lived 28 years in the UK and
                  was around 29 when he arrived).

               b. He has deep social ties with his children as set out above
                  whom he has an ongoing relation with.

               c. He has maintained his  cultural  ties  whilst  he  was  in
                  prison,  engaging  in  projects  for  little/no  pay   and
                  contributing to the wider UK interest in that way; he had,
                  albeit  without   entitlement,   engaged   in   work   and
                  contributed in that way.

               d. His  involvement  and  his  activity  in  respect  of  his
                  children's  education  demonstrates  social  and  cultural
                  parity with the UK.

               e. He is also supported by a local church.

               f. His offending was for a comparatively  short  period  when
                  assessed against his total time in the UK.

               g. The Appellant would face  very  significant  obstacles  on
                  return to Nigeria; he has been away from the  country  for
                  around 28 years; has not worked or lived there during that
                  time and has no meaningful family support on which he  can
                  rely there.

         Delay

         73. Finally,  the  Tribunal  is  respectfully  reminded  that  the
             Appellant made an application or leave to remain in July 2007.
             This was not decided for some 11  years  later  until  October
             2018.

         74. The delay  in  the  determination  of  the  Appellant's  claim
             diminishes the public interest in his removal insofar as:

               a.  when  considering  whether  there  are  "very  compelling
                  circumstances" over  and  above  those  described  in  the
                  Exceptions the public interest in deportation  is  plainly
                  lower  where  there  has  been  delay   in   deciding   an
                  application: CI (Nigeria) [2019] EWCA Civ 2027 at 51-53.

               b. The delay in the SSHD's determination of  the  Appellant's
                  application amounted to more than a decade. No explanation
                  had been provided by the SSHD for that delay. Had the SSHD
                  decided his application sooner, the weight to be  afforded
                  to his private life thereafter would be increased  to  his
                  benefit. The Tribunal is accordingly invited to take  that
                  into account  when  considering  whether  there  are  very
                  compelling circumstances over and above those described in
                  the exceptions.

               c. Additionally and in the same way, the  delay  in  deciding
                  the  Appellant's  reduces  the  weight  otherwise  to   be
                  accorded to the requirements of immigration  control  when
                  weighed against his family and private life: EB (Kosovo) v
                  SSHD [2008] UKHL 41; [2009] 1  AC  1159,  R  (Agyarko  and
                  Ikug) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11) at 51.

Additional oral submissions

15. Ms Griffiths referred to the cases of HA (Iraq) v SSHD [2020] EWCA  Civ
    1176; AA (Nigeria) v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 1296; and KB (Jamaica) v SSHD
    [2020] EWCA Civ 1385.  In particular, the appellant should succeed,  in
    her words, because the circumstances demonstrated the strength  of  the
    claims not  only  on  a  "vertical"  basis,  namely  they  fell  within
    Exceptions 1 and 2  and  were  of  sufficient  force,  but  also  on  a
    "horizontal" basis, namely there  were  circumstances  which  were  not
    captured within Exceptions 1 and 2, but nevertheless made  the  refusal
    of the human rights application disproportionate,  sufficient  to  meet
    the "very compelling circumstances" test.

16. In particular, HA (Iraq) made a  difference  to  the  understanding  of
    "unduly harsh" effects, with no "ordinary" level of harshness that  any
    children could be expected to suffer. There was an elevated  threshold,
    but this did not mean that the test could never be met.  In particular,
    at paragraph [56] of HA Iraq, there was support  for  consideration  of
    the age of the children; where they lived; the availability of  support
    from the remaining parent, MD and family members and  the  practicality
    of maintaining relationships. All of those factors applied here and the
    views of O, A and C, which might otherwise not be heard, should not  be
    ignored. On a scale of circumstances there may be children for whom the
    effect of deportation would be limited or even a positive  consequence,
    whilst for others, it would be akin to a bereavement, as in this  case.
    I should consider not only the  physical  effects  but  also  emotional
    development of the children.

17. MD's evidence was credible. She did not have to have given evidence  to
    support the appellant for her own  sake  and  she  disapproved  of  his
    actions. The appellant had been a constant  factor  in  the  children's
    lives, whether his involvement had increased or  decreased  at  various
    times and the importance that the role he played was highlighted in the
    report of Dr Farooqi. It was important that I  consider  not  only  the
    cumulative needs of the children but also  their  individual  needs  as
    they required individual attention. Ms Griffiths reiterated each of the
    children's personal circumstances, including O's  transition  to  adult
    life; C's epilepsy and the childrens' physical size, which impacted  on
    MD's ability to cope. The fact that MD had been able to  cope,  without
    social services or other support, whilst the appellant was  in  prison,
    did not mean she could do so on a permanent basis and any phone contact
    that the appellant had been  able  to  have  while  in  prison  was  no
    substitute for help, such as with personal hygiene for children.

18. The family circumstances went beyond 'unduly harsh'  effects  to  'very
    compelling circumstances' by virtue of the effects be more  akin  to  a
    bereavement.   In relation to very compelling circumstances,  I  needed
    to consider that there should be countervailing  reasons  to  the  best
    interests of  the  children.  The  appellant  had  pleaded  guilty  and
    regretted his actions. He was  at  low  risk  of  reoffending  and  had
    rehabilitated himself. He was attempting to make contributions  to  the
    community through his volunteering and wished to be a role model to his
    children.  Noting  MS  (s.117C(6):  "very  compelling   circumstances")
    Philippines [2019] UKUT 00122 (IAC) this was not a violent offence  and
    took place over five years ago and  there  was  a  distinction  between
    violent and non-violent offences. The public  interest  in  deportation
    was not fixed and the appellant had just met the requirement of serious
    offender with a prison term of four years. The appellant had  not  been
    to Nigeria nearly 30 years and was not speaking regularly to his family
    and had limited work experience  there  with  no  friends.  The  public
    interest and immigration control been damaged by the delay in resolving
    his application in 2007 and the interest in maintenance of  immigration
    controls was minor when weighing the impact on his family.

The respondent's submissions

19. I set out below excerpts from Mr Howells' skeleton argument:

         "Exception 1

             ...

             6.   It is submitted that the Appellant does not meet  two  of
             the three requirements in Exception 1.

             7.   First, the Appellant has not been  lawfully  resident  in
             the UK for most of his life.  Indeed, he has never been  given
             leave to remain in the UK.

             8.   Second, there are not very significant obstacles  to  the
             Appellant's integration in Nigeria.

             ...

             11.  In the Respondent's submission, the Appellant would be an
             "insider" on return to Nigeria.  On his account, he  lived  in
             Nigeria from birth until he left in 1992 aged 28 or 29  years.
             The Appellant is likely to retain an understanding of how life
             in Nigeria is carried on and there  is  no  evidence  that  he
             lacks the capacity to participate in Nigerian society.  He  is
             57 years old and in apparent good physical and mental  health.
             There is no evidence that he is "estranged" from Nigeria."

         Exception 2

             12.  The Appellant's  relationship  with  [MD]  is  no  longer
             subsisting.  As she is not his partner, there is  no  need  to
             consider whether his deportation would be unduly harsh on her.

             13.  The issue is whether the Appellant's deportation would be
             unduly harsh on MD'  three  children,  two  of  whom  are  his
             biological  children  (A  and  C,  aged  13   and   11   years
             respectively), the other (O, aged 17 years)  for  whom  he  is
             said to have acted as a father figure since the child was  two
             years old.  The Respondent accepts  that  all  three  children
             have autism, while C also has epilepsy.

             14.  The courts have confirmed that the "unduly harsh" test is
             a stringent and demanding one.

             ...

             20.  The Respondent accepts that it would be unduly harsh  for
             A, C and O to live in Nigeria but submits that it would not be
             unduly harsh  for  them  to  remain  in  the  UK  without  the
             Appellant.  Although it may well be in the best  interests  of
             the children for  the  Appellant  to  remain  in  the  UK,  ZH
             (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 established that the  best  interests
             of children  -  while  a  primary  consideration  -  could  be
             outweighed by the strength of other considerations.

             21.   In  her  undated  report,  Dr   Rukhsana   Farooqi,   an
             independent social work consultant, considers that it would be
             very difficult for MD to manage  the  needs  of  the  children
             without  the  Appellant's  involvement  as  a   joint   carer.
             However, Dr Farooqi does not address how MD  managed  to  cope
             during  the  relatively  recent  32-month  period   when   the
             Appellant was in  detention,  between  6  April  2017  and  11
             December 2019 [19] [38].  While the Respondent accepts that it
             would be difficult for MD without the Appellant, there  is  no
             evidence that his 32-month absence had a detrimental effect on
             the children, other than the emotional impact one would expect
             when a child is separated from a parent.

             22.  According to Dr Farooqi, MD would not - in the absence of
             the Appellant - want a local authority  or  private  carer  to
             assist her, as the children would not respond well to an adult
             they did not know [21] [23] [48-49].  The  Respondent  accepts
             that, due to their autism, the children prefer people they are
             familiar with and do not like change.  However, this would not
             exclude the possibility of a carer being gradually  introduced
             into the  home  environment,  as  presumably  new  adults  are
             introduced into their respective school environments from time
             to time.

             23.   Dr  Farooqi's  assessment  is  based  on  a  "permanent"
             physical  separation  between  the  Appellant  and  the  three
             children [19] [43] [48].  This ignores  the  possibility  that
             they might be able to visit him in Nigeria with their  mother.
             Further, contact between the Appellant and the three  children
             could be maintained by modern means of communication.

             24.  The Appellant's Counsel's Skeleton Argument submits that,
             due to their age [11, 13 and 17], the three children are at  a
             critical stage of  their  personal  development  [66(a)].   In
             response, the Respondent relies on [15] of RA Iraq:

                  What might at first appear to be  hard-edged  findings  of
                  fact often turn out  to  be  evaluative  assessments.   On
                  analysing the above passages from MK (Sierra Leone),  that
                  is the position here.   The  Upper  Tribunal's  conclusion
                  that children aged 7 are at a  "critical  stage  of  their
                  development" was such an assessment, based  on  the  facts
                  before it. It was not the laying bare of an obvious  fact,
                  of which any other court or tribunal must  take  "judicial
                  notice".  One could envisage  an  equally  valid  argument
                  that a child of 2 or 3 is  at  a  critical  stage  of  its
                  development; or a child at or approaching puberty, and  so
                  on.  Childhood  is  a  developmental  progression  towards
                  becoming an adult.

             25.   In  the  Respondent's  submission,  the  effect  of  the
             Appellant's deportation on the three children would not  reach
             the high threshold of "undue harshness".

         Section 117C(6)

             27.  The Respondent submits that  there  is  a  strong  public
             interest in the deportation of the Appellant:

               1) Between 15 February 2005 and 6 April 2017,  the  Appellant
                  received four convictions, involving eleven offences.  See
                  Police National Computer printout at RB, Annex H.

               2) The latest conviction, involving  four  offences  and  for
                  which he was sentenced  to  imprisonment  of  four  years,
                  related to a conspiracy to defraud Southern Rail,  one  of
                  his former employers.   In  his  sentencing  remarks,  His
                  Honour Judge Clark QC described the Appellant as being  at
                  the centre  of  a  "very  serious  and  sophisticated  and
                  repeated  conspiracy  to  defraud":   the  Appellant   was
                  involved in 350 false travel delay claims over a sustained
                  period of time [between 1 January 2012 and 28 April 2015],
                  ensnared others, abused his position as a former employee,
                  and received a large proportion of  the  �55,000  proceeds
                  from this repeated fraud [RB, Annex  J].   The  sentencing
                  judge found that the Appellant met almost  every  category
                  of high culpability.  As the Upper Tribunal stated  in  RA
                  Iraq, "...  the public interest in the  deportation  of  a
                  foreign criminal is high; and even  higher  for  a  person
                  sentenced to imprisonment of at least four years" [22].

               3)  In  MS  (s.117C(6):  "very   compelling   circumstances")
                  Philippines [2019] UKUT 00122 (IAC),  the  Upper  Tribunal
                  (led by Mr Justice Lane, President) held  that  there  was
                  nothing in Hesham Ali (Iraq) [2016] UKSC 60 that  requires
                  a court or tribunal to eschew  the  principle  of  general
                  deterrence, as an  element  of  the  public  interest,  in
                  determining a deportation appeal by reference  to  Section
                  117C(6).  The Respondent submits that there is a deterrent
                  value to the deportation of the Appellant,  in  sending  a
                  clear message to other foreign nationals that  involvement
                  in serious crime normally  results  in  deportation.   The
                  public interest also includes the need to maintain  public
                  confidence in the system of immigration control.

               4) In 2008, the Appellant had  received  a  six-month  prison
                  sentence after pleading guilty to two counts  of  using  a
                  false  instrument  with  intent,  in  2001/02  and   2008.
                  Clearly, he did not learn the lesson from his first period
                  of imprisonment.  As the Offender Manager  states  in  the
                  OASys report, the Appellant appears to have a  pattern  of
                  committing crimes of an acquisitive nature  for  financial
                  gain [AB, page 51].

               5) Section 117D(1) provides that the deportation  of  foreign
                  criminals is in the public interest.

               6) Section 117D(2) provides that the more serious the offence
                  committed by a foreign criminal, the greater is the public
                  interest in the deportation of  the  criminal.   As  noted
                  above,  the  sentencing  judge  in  2017  found  that  the
                  Appellant was  at  the  centre  of  a  "very  serious  and
                  sophisticated and repeated conspiracy to defraud":

               7) Section 117B(1) provides that the maintenance of effective
                  immigration controls  is  in  the  public  interest.   The
                  Appellant claims to have entered the UK as  a  visitor  in
                  1992.  Since then, he has  never  been  granted  leave  to
                  remain.  The HMRC schedule indicates  that  the  Appellant
                  worked illegally between 1993 and 2007 [RB, page B9].  His
                  employment with Southern Rail was as  an  overstayer,  not
                  with the authority of the Respondent.   In  his  statement
                  dated 24 February 2020, the  Appellant  accepts  that  his
                  employment with Southern Rail between 2002  and  2006  was
                  secured with the use of a false identity.

             28.  In the Skeleton Argument, the Appellant's Counsel  relies
             on   five   factors   as   constituting    "very    compelling
             circumstances" when viewed individually or cumulatively  [60].
             In response, the Respondent submits:

               a) The Appellant's British children and step-son

                  See [13-25] above.

               b) The nature of the Appellant's offending

                  The sentencing judge in 2017 found that the Appellant  was
                  at the centre of a "very  serious  and  sophisticated  and
                  repeated conspiracy to defraud".  The judge referred to "a
                  large number of victims".

                  The sentencing judge found that the Appellant  met  almost
                  every category of high culpability.  He  did  not  mention
                  any mitigating factors.

                  By exploiting a scheme designed to refund train  commuters
                  for travel delays, the  Appellant  and  his  co-defendants
                  caused financial loss to the train operating companies,  a
                  loss which could have  been  passed  on  to  commuters  in
                  general, in the form of higher ticket prices.  There is  a
                  public interest in preventing the  defrauding  of  schemes
                  designed to compensate honest rail  commuters  who  suffer
                  delays.

                  Clearly, the Appellant did not learn the lesson  from  his
                  period of imprisonment in 2008.  As the  Offender  Manager
                  states in the OASys report, the Appellant appears to  have
                  a pattern of committing crimes of  an  acquisitive  nature
                  for financial gain [AB, page 51].

               c) Rehabilitation

                  Since the Appellant has been at liberty in  the  community
                  for less than eight months, it is  premature  to  describe
                  the Appellant as "already  rehabilitated",  as  stated  at
                  [69] of Counsel's Skeleton Argument.

                  In RA Iraq, (see  paragraphs  [32]  and  [33])  the  Upper
                  Tribunal found that  rehabilitation  will  not  ordinarily
                  bear material material  weight  in  favour  of  a  foreign
                  criminal....

                  As noted above, the  Upper  Tribunal  has  confirmed  that
                  another side of the public interest  in  deportation  (the
                  effect of deterrence) does carry material weight against a
                  foreign criminal.  There is also a need to maintain public
                  confidence in the system of immigration control.

               d) Private life

                  The Appellant claims to have entered the UK as  a  visitor
                  in 1992.  Since then, he has never been granted  leave  to
                  remain.  Section 117B(4)(a) provides  that  little  weight
                  should be given to a private  life  established  when  the
                  person is in the UK unlawfully.

               e) Delay

                  The Respondent accepts that the human  rights  application
                  made on the Appellant's behalf by A-Z Solicitors on 21 May
                  2007 was not resolved until its refusal in the deportation
                  decision letter of 17 October 2018, a delay of  more  than
                  ten years.  It is submitted that the weight to be given to
                  this factor in the Appellant's favour is  reduced  by  the
                  fact  that   neither   he   nor   his   subsequent   legal
                  representatives actively pursued the  resolution  of  this
                  application in correspondence to the Respondent.

                  The letter dated 5 August 2009 from SLA Solicitors, making
                  representations under the Case Resolution scheme, made  no
                  mention of the application of 21 May 2007 [RB,  Annex  B].
                  Neither did the human rights application dated  20  August
                  2014 from GK Legal [RB, page 21].  Of the two human rights
                  applications made on the Appellant's behalf in  2014,  the
                  first was rejected because the  appropriate  fee  had  not
                  been paid, and the second was refused without a  right  of
                  appeal because the application was  not  made  during  the
                  currency of valid leave.  The Respondent's response  to  a
                  Pre-Action Protocol (PAP) letter from GK Legal about these
                  two applications in 2014 did not mention  the  application
                  of 21 May 2007 [RB, Annex C] because  the  issue  was  not
                  raised by GK Legal in their PAP letter, not even in  their
                  summary of the Appellant's immigration history [RB,  pages
                  E1-11].  The Appellant's brief statement dated 10-3-15 did
                  not mention the application of 21 May 2007 [RB, pages  G3-
                  4].  Neither did GK Legal's letter  dated  6  March  2018,
                  making representations against the Appellant's deportation
                  [RB, Annex R].

Additional oral submissions

20. Mr Howells reiterated  that  whilst  the  appellant  remained  socially
    integrated in the UK, he did not claim had been in the UK for  most  of
    his life, even taking his case at its highest and had  never  leave  to
    remain in the UK. There was no  sense  in  which  he  would  return  to
    Nigeria as an "outsider" and no evidence that he lacked the capacity to
    participate in Nigerian society. The respondent accepted that the  'go'
    option was not  viable  and  that  the  appellant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with the children but I  was  reminded
    that the test was not  merely  "harsh",  but  "unduly  harsh"  effects.
    Whilst the appellant and MD claimed to have lived together between 2005
    and 2017 there were several documents which  undermined  that.  MD  was
    also inconsistent in her evidence as to whether O was given homework in
    the period when the appellant was in  prison  and  also  the  level  of
    contact during the period of the pandemic.

21. Dr Farooqi's report did not address how MD coped during the appellant's
    period in prison. What was striking was the lack of evidence about  any
    deterioration in the children's welfare,  behaviour  or  other  adverse
    impact when the appellant was in prison, because of his absence, and at
    the end  of  the  period  of  the  appellant's  imprisonment  in  2019,
    correspondence from one of  the  children's  schools  referred  to  the
    "amazing job" that MD had done. Whilst correspondence from the  NHS  of
    June 2019 (page [16] of the supplementary bundle) had referred  to  C's
    more aggressive behaviour since December 2018 this was  not  linked  in
    any way to the absence of the appellant. Child A's progress review of 7
    June 2019 at page [27] of the supplementary bundle  referred  to  A  as
    having "settled in well" and even if the intervention of a professional
    carer, on the appellant's deportation,  represented  a  change  in  the
    children's arrangements, presumably other changes would  have  occurred
    in existing school arrangements over time, while the appellant had been
    in prison.

22. While the appellant  referred  to  the  lack  of  face-to-face  contact
    between the children and him in the event of his  deportation,  he  had
    been able to maintain regular FaceTime contact  with  them  during  the
    Covid pandemic. The appellant's assertion that the children were  at  a
    'critical age' would apply to any age of childhood.

23. Significant weight should be attached  to  the  appellant's  offending,
    with the appellant's role as a ringleader in a  conspiracy.  The  false
    travel claims had been made over a period  of  over  three  years;  the
    appellant  had  abused  a  position  of  trust  and  received  a  large
    proportion of the profits. He met every category  of  high  culpability
    and this was not the appellant's first offence. His  earlier  offending
    could not be explained by his need to support MD and the children.

24. Of the factors said to support the appellant:

      a) While the appellant had referred to his rehabilitation, he had only
         been at liberty for 13 months, which was  too  short  a  period  to
         establish rehabilitation and much of that  period  was  within  the
         context of pandemic and lockdown, with  a  correspondingly  limited
         opportunity to offend. In any event, rehabilitation should not have
         a particularly great weight attached to it.

      b) The delay in consideration  of  the  appellant's  2007  application
         might have greater weight,  had  the  appellant  not  made  further
         applications and not referred to the outstanding application in any
         way in those applications, including a statement produced in  2015.
         The respondent was not "sitting" on the  application,  but  it  was
         simply  overlooked  and  other   applications   were   dealt   with
         expeditiously.

      c) In terms of the appellant's personal circumstances, he was 58;  had
         a  degree  in  business  management  from  Nigeria;   has   several
         qualifications and had worked  in  the  UK;  spoke  more  than  one
         language including Yoruba; was in contact  with  three  sisters  in
         Nigeria; and had referred  to  a  friend  who  had  photos  of  his
         mother's burial site in Nigeria, so  clearly  continued  to  retain
         links there.

Findings of fact

25. I considered all of the evidence presented to me, whether I refer to it
    specifically in these findings or not.

26. The appellant and MD both adopted their witness statements and also
    gave oral evidence on which they were cross-examined.  I do not recite
    their evidence in full, not least because some of it dealt with issues
    which had previously been contested but were no longer contested by the
    date of the hearing, specifically in relation to the ongoing parental
    relationship between the appellant and his children.

27. Much of the evidence is no longer contested although it is necessary
    for me to consider the credibility of the appellant and MD more
    generally in areas where it is contested.  I accept Ms Griffith's
    submission that merely because somebody has been dishonest in the past,
    it does not mean that on each and every occasion they are not telling
    the truth.  Nevertheless, I note that the appellant has four separate
    convictions for 11 offences, all involving dishonesty, as set out in
    the police record or 'PNC' record at page [H2], RB:

      a) a conviction on 15th February 2005, for an offence committed on
         13th December 2004, for when he used a false instrument to obtain a
         medical prescription, for which he was fined;

      b) convictions on 28th June 2007 for offences committed on 4th
         December 2006, for obtaining employment using a false British birth
         certificate for which he was convicted on 28th June 2007, for which
         he received community orders;

      c) convictions on 12th June 2008 for offences of a similar nature,
         committed between 1st December 2001 and 22nd January 2002; and on
         27th May 2008, for which he received a sentence of six months in
         prison; and finally,

      d) the convictions for which he received a sentence of four years'
         imprisonment on 6th April 2017; for his lead role in the
         conspiracy, committed between 1st January 2012 and 28th April 2015.

28. Such offending leads me to have significant caution in accepting the
    appellant's honesty where there is a dispute as to the facts based on
    his evidence alone.  This is reinforced by the appellant's evidence
    before me that he had also been deliberately untruthful in specifying
    an incorrect address in an application for leave to remain in 2014, for
    which he claimed in oral evidence that he was "misled by a friend", was
    in a "vulnerable state", was desperate to regularise his status and
    was "misadvised."

29. However, I also further accepted Ms Griffiths' submission that MD, the
    appellant's former partner, is no longer in a relationship with him and
    there are no similar questions regarding her honesty, and the fact that
    she was willing to attend the hearing before me, in-person during the
    Covid pandemic to give evidence on the appellant's behalf, was
    testament to the genuineness and strength of her belief of the quality
    of the relationship between the appellant and his children; and the
    support that he provides to them and to MD.

A brief chronology

30. On the appellant's witness evidence, he entered the UK on 31st October
    1992, although as recorded in the respondent's decision, there was no
    evidence of a legal entry on that date.  The appellant relies on a
    photocopied schedule of NIC Class-1 (Employed) contributions from 1993
    to 2007, at pages [B9] to [B10] RB, of minimal amounts (in the majority
    of years a few hundred pounds, and never more than �2,556.30 in 2006/7
    but I also note that he used a false birth certificate to obtain work
    between 2002 and 2006, on his own witness evidence, with Southern Rail.
     The fact that no proper PAYE records have been disclosed is the first
    concern, so it is not possible to compare post 2002 employment income
    (when the appellant claims to have been working illegally) with pre-
    2002 income.  Put other way, such records and other evidence as are
    often provided with long-residence appeals are largely missing, and the
    appellant claims to have been in receipt of employment income, so that
    PAYE documents would have originally been produced.  There is no other
    evidence or detail on the earlier, pre-2002 employment history.
    Second, is the concern that the appellant, on his own case, managed to
    obtain a national insurance number in 1993, without the right to work,
    which begs the question of what weight can be attached to such a
    record.  I tie these in with the appellant's willingness to rely upon
    false documentation of a formal nature (birth certificates), and MD's
    lack of knowledge of the appellant prior to 2005.  In the context of
    the large gaps in evidence, I do not find as reliable the appellant's
    claim that he has been in the UK continuously since 1992. I am prepared
    to accept that he entered the UK in 1992 and has been in the UK for
    periods since then ( I say more on that below), but there is not
    sufficient, reliable evidence of continuous presence prior to 2005,
    when he met MD.

31. I am also prepared to accept, based on the PNC record, the appellant's
    presence in the UK during certain periods by virtue of his offending.
    Based on the PNC record, as set out above, I find that the appellant
    was at least present between December 2001 and January 2002 in relation
    to the offence involving Southern Rail and in December 2004.  I also
    find, on the basis of MD's evidence to have been in a relationship with
    him which started at around the end of 2005, that he has been in the UK
    since the end of 2005.

32. The appellant sought to explain, in oral evidence, that his later
    offending was caused by the desperate financial position in which he
    and MD found themselves, living in cramped accommodation and with three
    children to provide for.  However, that does not explain the
    appellant's earlier offences in 2001/2 and 2004, both of which predated
    the appellant's relationship with MD.  In essence, the appellant was
    already repeatedly engaged in offences involving deception prior to the
    relationship with MD and there was no suggestion that at this stage he
    had sought to regularise his status in the UK, after his initial
    arrival.  Correspondence from his former solicitors, dated 5th August
    2009, refers to an apparent claim for asylum in February 1993, refused
    in July 1994 (page [B1] RB), but this was not drawn to my attention by
    either representative or the witnesses in the hearing and the first
    application to which they drew my attention was the application in 2007
    on human rights grounds.

33. At the start of their relationship, MD already had a son, 'O', born on
    1st February 2003, by a previous relationship.  I find, based on MD's
    uncontested witness evidence, that whilst O continues to have a
    relationship with his biological father, the appellant has, in essence,
    stepped into the shoes as a father to O.

34. 'A', the first of the couple's biological children, was born on 18th
    August 2006.  The couple's youngest child, a daughter, 'C', was born on
    8 September 2008. The evidence of MD and the appellant is that apart
    from periods in which the appellant was in prison, that the appellant
    was a resident father, living as part of a family unit with MD, apart
    from the period of imprisonment of six months, which must have
    separated the family, when the appellant was convicted on the third
    occasion in June 2008;  and until his most recent period of
    imprisonment which began on 6th April 2017. He was released on 11th
    December 2019, but is not longer resident, his relationship with MD as
    her partner having ended.

35. One particular factual dispute was the fact that, at page [D2] RB,
    there is a copy of a letter from a supporter of the appellant, written
    from an address other than that of MD, asserting that the appellant had
    been living with him from October 2012 until the date of the letter, at
    12th July 2014.  That was produced for the purposes of an application
    for leave to remain dated 20th August 2014 by the appellant, a copy of
    which was at page [D2] RB, on the basis of his relationship with the
    children alone, and not any relationship with MD.  In other words, the
    application was made on the basis that he was a non-resident father,
    rather than as MD's partner.

36. The appellant has given oral evidence before me that this part of the
    application was intentionally untruthful and that he did so to avoid
    any complications for MD or the children.  I accept, on balance, that
    notwithstanding his application, the appellant continued to live with
    MD and the children during this period. I take into account the
    evidence referred to by Ms Griffiths of the bank statements in the
    appellant's name (beginning at page [G31] of the appellant's main
    bundle), which show regular withdrawals in the period from July 2013 in
    MD's local area, rather than in the supporter's local area, as well as
    MD's witness evidence.

37. I find that following his release on 11th December 2019, the appellant
    has ongoing regular contact, albeit as a non-resident father, with his
    children and although the relationship between he and MD has ended,
    they maintain a supportive relationship and he helps her to care for
    the children.

38. As one final part of the chronology, before coming on to the
    appellant's most recent conviction, I step back and note the issue of
    an earlier human rights application by the appellant in 2007. The
    respondent accepts that on 21st May 2007, the appellant made an
    application for leave to remain outside the Rules, which was not
    resolved until its refusal in the deportation decision letter of 17th
    October 2018.

39. As Mr Howells correctly submitted, having made the application in 2007,
    there was no subsequent reference to this in correspondence from the
    appellant's then solicitors, SLA Solicitors of 5th August 2009, a copy
    of which was at page [B1] RB,  in which the appellant applied for leave
    to remain on the basis of his family life, nor the subsequent
    application of 20th August 2014 at [D2] RB; or the pre-action protocol
    correspondence dated 27th November 2014 at page [E1] RB.  Whatever the
    reason for the lack of pursuit of the application might be, I accept
    that the appellant's application was not resolved for over a decade and
    that it is mostly likely that it was overlooked, by both the respondent
    and the appellant's representatives, until 2018.

The appellant's most recent conviction and imprisonment

40. As accepted by the appellant, his most recent offending, for which he
    was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, was over an extended period
    from 1st January 2012 to 28th April 2015 and the national media reports
    at page [K1] RB described the appellant as a 'ring-leader' and referred
    to the use of dozens of different names and addresses over an even
    longer, five year period, together with appellant and an accomplice
    giving one another nicknames as they "joked about their crimes" (page
    [K6] RB).   In terms of the sentencing remarks made by His Honour Judge
    Clarke QC, they read as follows:

"During that trial, it emerged as an absolute certainty that you were at
the centre of this conspiracy and were involved in every single false claim
that was made in some way or other.

I am entirely satisfied that you ensnared others, some of them became
willing accomplices, others were less involved and tried to distance
themselves from what you had planned.  When I have to look at the
sentencing guidelines, going through each category of high culpability you
fill virtually every category: a leading role where offending is part of
the group activity; involvement with others through pressure or influence;
abuse of position of power or trust or responsibility as an ex-Southern
Rail employee; the sophisticated nature of the offence or planning, and
given that there were 350 claims that you went to the trouble to make this
was highly sophisticated and the fraudulent activity was conducted over a
sustained period of time and a large number of victims. ... I regret to say
that you fill virtually every category of that when I have to decide on the
level of criminality as far as you are concerned."

41. The Judge recognised the appellant's early guilty plea. He also
    referred to the value of the attempted fraud, totalling �100,000 in 350
    claims, of which 171 claims were successful and the train operating
    companies had paid out just short of �55,000, of which the appellant
    had received a "large proportion". The offences for which the appellant
    was convicted went beyond conspiracy to defraud and also included
    sections 328 and 329 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA), or what
    is more commonly referred to as money-laundering.

42. I find that during the period of the appellant's imprisonment, whilst
    his children were not informed of his imprisonment and in fact MD
    informed them that he had gone away on holiday, only later informing O
    alone of the true circumstances, the appellant remained in regular,
    albeit brief, telephone contact with his children and recorded reading
    stories for them through a scheme arranged by the Prison Service.
    Therefore, whilst there were no visits during his imprisonment, there
    was a regularity of contact established which developed further upon
    the appellant's subsequent release.

43. In terms of the criminal offending, I also considered the question of
    the risk of the appellant reoffending and the extent to which he has
    sought to rehabilitate himself, or as Ms Griffiths asserts, whether his
    rehabilitation is complete.  I have the benefit of an OASys Report
    dated 12th February 2018, a copy of which was in the appellant's first
    bundle, starting at page [33].  The report assessed the appellant's
    general risk of reoffending within one year as 11% and within the
    second year of 20%.  At page [42], it referred to the appellant having
    attained a degree in Nigeria before he came to the UK, where he had
    attained qualifications in project management, entry level journalism,
    project and money management.  He had completed further courses while
    in prison, including peer-mentoring and industrial cleaning, as well as
    further qualifications and is studying web-design and French.  The
    report described the appellant as saying that he had seven siblings
    with whom he got on well, one of whom had passed away.

44. Contrary to Ms Griffiths assertion that there is "no further
    convictions not any indication of non-compliant behaviour" (paragraph
    [68(b)] of the skeleton argument) the OASys report refers to the
    appellant as having an adjudication for possession of an unauthorised
    mobile phone (at page [44]). The same page reported the appellant as
    saying that he did not suffer from anxiety or depression, victimisation
    or isolation while in prison.  He had had no thoughts of self-harm.
    The OASys assessor concluded that the appellant represented a "low
    risk" in the community (page [54]).

45. I also considered up-to-date evidence on the appellant's volunteering,
    including helping fellow detainees while in immigration detention; and
    also with the Detention Action representative organisation, as a
    volunteer interpreter in Yoruba, as well as being selected for
    participation as a member of its Equality, Diversity and Inclusion
    Group at the end of this month.

46. On the one hand, I have noted the appellant's repeated involvement in
    dishonesty offences and that his release from detention is only
    relatively recent (11th December 2019). He has accepted to the OASys
    author that he is not easily led and that his offences were pre-
    planned, for financial reasons, albeit he knows the difference between
    right and wrong, which, noting the pre-planning, in some respects may
    be worrying in itself.  On the other hand, the expertise of OASys's
    author has not been challenged and I accept her assessment that the
    chance of the appellant's subsequent reoffending is low and the
    opportunity for him to reoffend may reduced further by the wide
    publicity of his criminal offending, including in national newspapers
    on social media.  I also accept that at least the most recent offending
    may have been motivated, in part, by a desire to support MD and her
    children, even if the earlier offending was simply for financial gain.
    The appellant is no longer resident with MD and she has confirmed that
    she is in receipt of a number of benefits for the three children,
    including carer's allowance and disability living allowance for them,
    and so is unlikely to be in need of financial support from the
    appellant. In summary, the likelihood of the appellant's reoffending is
    low.  I accept that the appellant has taken steps to rehabilitate
    himself in his work with the Detention Action organisation and in his
    training courses, but I do not accept the reliability of Ms Griffiths'
    assertion that he is fully rehabilitated because he has not offended
    since 2015; the period since 2015 includes a period under arrest, bail,
    prosecution and imprisonment, which has included an (albeit minor)
    adjudication, so that the period since release in December 2019 and
    consequential opportunity to reoffend is very recent.  It is premature,
    in my view, to find that the appellant is fully rehabilitated after a
    period of repeat offending from 2001 to 2014, with increasing levels of
    seriousness.

The appellant's three children

47. Turning to the appellant's three children, I set out below my findings
    in relation to each of them.

Child O

48. The various school records confirm that O has significantly delayed
    development in English speaking and understanding, and significant
    difficulty with most of the educational benchmark tests carried out.
    The independent social worker report written by Dr Farooqi, provided
    loose, refers at paragraphs [28] to [30] to O being 18 on 1st February
    2021 (so very shortly) but presenting as much younger than his age,
    with a diagnosis of "Autism Spectrum Disorder".  Dr Farooqi met with O,
    his siblings and the appellant and MD at MD's home, and none of the
    children were able to hold a conversation with her.  She observed
    instead their behaviour with their parents and assessed what MD and the
    appellant informed her, in conjunction with the background
    documentation.

49. Dr Farooqi noted that in the speech and language transition report, O
    found interacting with his peers challenging and requires help with
    household tasks and in particular he still needs supervision and
    guidance and cannot not go out on his own.  O was clingy around the
    appellant and did not want the appellant to leave the room.  Dr Farooqi
    assessed this as indicating how important the appellant was to O.

50. MD confirmed in oral evidence that she and the appellant were
    considering the options for O on leaving school at the end of this next
    academic year, with options possibly including university attendance or
    vocational training.  On the one hand, it therefore appears that O's
    development is sufficient that at least university or a vocational
    trade is being considered, but on the other hand, MD added that she
    regarded any further education or training setting as needing to be
    local, i.e. within travelling distance of the family home, because of
    O's inability to organise himself and his difficulty in coping with
    household tasks.

51. I am satisfied on the evidence, not least Dr Faooqi's report, that O
    remains a highly vulnerable individual by virtue of his Autism
    condition, needing supervision in daily tasks, with communication
    difficulties and not being able leave the family home alone.  Any
    transition to university of vocational training is likely to be in a
    local setting, with substantial support continuing both in the home
    setting and in any educational or training setting.  MD described how,
    during the appellant's imprisonment, O stayed after school to complete
    homework as she was unable to assist him. I note, without criticism of
    MD in any way, that MD herself is unconfident in her literacy and
    computer skills, and would need the support either from the appellant,
    who has provided support in the past, or from the educational or
    training provider themselves, as when the appellant was in prison.

Child A

52. A was born on 18th August 2006 and so is now 14 years old.  He was also
    assessed by Dr Farooqi, who noted A's limited ability to express his
    wishes and feelings verbally, with difficulties in communication,
    social interaction and play.  He has also been diagnosed with Autism,
    as confirmed in his special need report at page [45] of the appellant's
    supplementary bundle and the severity of his condition is reflected in
    the fact that he attends a special day school as opposed to a
    mainstream setting.  Dr Farooqi described his use and understanding of
    language as severely delayed, with a desire for familiarity with family
    and other familiar surroundings.  There are issues with A's ability to
    understood social norms, for example in relation to when he should or
    should not hug people and how he should address people.  He requires
    ongoing speech and language support and as with O, needs stability,
    security and a clear structure in the family home.  Dr Farooqi
    similarly observed, through A's behaviour, that A was clingy around the
    appellant, which was also consistent with the importance of the role
    the appellant played in A's life.

Child C

53. C, the couple's daughter, was born on 8th September 2008, so is now 12
    years old.  C also has a diagnosis of Autism as confirmed in a final
    statement of educational needs dated 2020; she has significantly
    delayed understanding and use of language and requires adults to
    support her with timetables, routine and structure, as commented on by
    Dr Farooqi in her report at paragraph [33], with special educational
    needs support at school. She was also diagnosed with epilepsy in June
    2019. When suffering seizures, she becomes unresponsive, with
    repetitive mouth movements and her head turning from one side to
    another. Such episodes can last about three minutes, following which C
    sleeps for around three hours; and the frequency of episodes could be
    in a cluster of two to three in a day, occurring once every other week
    (page [116] of the supplementary bundle).  Between 11st April and 24th
    May 2019, there were no further occurrences, but in May 2019, there was
    worsening period.

54. Dr Farooqi observed a 'clinginess' between C and the appellant, as with
    the other children.

Relationship between the appellant and the children

55. I find that while the appellant's extent of the involvement over the
    years with O and his siblings has varied, from very limited while in
    prison for 32 months between 2017 and 2019; (with no evidence on the
    earlier imprisonment after the appellant's conviction in June 2008) to
    currently, seeing the children at least weekly, if not more frequently
    (the variation since the appellant's release has depended on the extent
    of lock-down during the Covid pandemic). The appellant plays an
    important part in supervising and looking after the children; and he
    has a strong emotional rapport with them, providing part of the
    structure, security and stability identified by Dr Farooqi at paragraph
    [31] of her report.

56. The relationship is therefore far removed from some parental
    relationships which are the subject of removal appeals, which while
    genuine and subsisting, are nevertheless limited to infrequent contact
    or non-direct means of communication.  It is a genuine relationship, as
    opposed to being manufactured or rehearsed and Dr Farooqi's observation
    of the children's behaviour in their family home is powerful evidence
    of that. Correspondence dated 2015 from the childrens' schools, as Dr
    Farooqi notes at paragraph [36], confirms the appellant's regular
    attendance at parents' evenings, meetings with other professionals and
    his "always" dropping the children off at school.  It was also telling
    that MD was unable to explain in oral evidence the precise nature of
    the support provided by the schools to the children, stating that she
    relied on the appellant to engage with the schools, even sending him
    school correspondence when he was in prison. This was consistent with
    MD's lack of confidence in reading and using IT.  She has been unable,
    for example, to help the children access remote teaching via computer-
    access during the Covid pandemic and relies on the appellant to help
    them.

57. One part of the picture which the respondent seeks to criticise is the
    gap in Dr Farooqi's report on how MD coped looking after the children
    during the period when the appellant was in prison on the second
    occasion for the 32 months from 6th April 2017 until 11th December
    2009, during which the children never visited or saw the appellant.
    Correspondence from one of the childrens' teachers dated 17th September
    2019, when the appellant had been imprisoned for nearly all of those 32
    months, referred to at paragraph [37] of Dr Farooqi's report, described
    MD as having "done an amazing job with the children but she would
    continue to need family support as the children grow".  Dr Farooqi
    noted, at paragraph [38], MD's statement that she had struggled to care
    for the children whilst the appellant was in prison, which she
    reiterated in oral evidence, having been late on occasion in getting
    the children to different schools.  MD reiterated, as recorded by Dr
    Farooqi at paragraph [39], that she would not now be able to cope
    without the appellant, because despite their ages, the children could
    not be left unsupervised and they needed help and supervision with
    daily tasks.

58. At paragraph [43] of her report, Dr Farooqi assessed the children as
    being "very dependent" on the appellant,  as well as MD, to care for
    them and to provide for their emotional needs and it would be a
    significant loss to them if the appellant were forced to move to
    Nigeria as they would be permanently separated from him.  If they were
    to lose their father because of a move to Nigeria, due to their
    dependency on him and the role he played, it was her assessment that
    this was not in their welfare or best interests (paragraph [45]).  Due
    to the culmination of their complex needs, it would be very difficult
    for MD to manage without the appellant, in particular because of the
    benefits of his physical presence in helping with the practical tasks
    of feeding, clothing, washing and escorting them to school and to
    activities, as well as with discipline and supervision, which MD could
    not manage on her own.  Dr Farooqi emphasised again how difficult it
    would be for one person to manage on their own.  She considered, in
    terms of alternative care provision, at paragraph [49], that if the
    appellant were not available, MD may need to consider respite care or a
    live-in (domiciliary) carer to assist her.  Dr Farooqi assessed the
    children as preferring people they were familiar with; they did not
    like change and they might find such an arrangement difficult to
    tolerate and that it was "not worth taking the risk if they have their
    father to assist their mother to care for them".

59. Dr Farooqi's report addressed the central issue in this appeal, namely
    the consequences of the "stay" option, i.e. in the event of the
    appellant's removal, the effect on the children staying in the UK.  I
    accept Ms Griffith's submission that whilst I would not consider
    directly MD's needs, to the extent that MD's inability to cope would be
    a result of the appellant's deportation, it is appropriate for me to
    consider that issue.  Put in simple terms, if she would lose his
    support, that would then in turn impact and have effects on each of the
    three children and Dr Farooqi was clear that one person would struggle
    to cope, without help.

60. It is in the above context that I find that whilst MD was able to cope
    (just) with the appellant's absence whilst he was imprisoned, a
    permanent separation would mean that one person, namely MD, would not
    be able to cope on their own.  I also find that in reality, the
    consequence of the appellant's deportation would result in a permanent
    physical separation.  I accept that MD had been willing to consider,
    when she was still in a relationship with the appellant, a visit to
    Nigeria alone as part of a church visit in 2014 (with financial support
    from her church), with a Nigerian visa and entry clearance stamps at
    [G9] and [G10] being evidence of a brief visit in June to July 2014,
    but without any evidence of travel by the children.  I accept MD's
    evidence that she would be unable to take any of the children with her
    in future to see their father in Nigeria and she is no longer in a
    relationship with him. Travel between the UK and Nigeria for three
    children who have behavioural and other complex needs would ordinarily
    be an arduous and difficult task, but where, as here MD, does not work
    and is reliant on benefits, I do not find it realistic that there is
    any possibility of visits between the appellant and his children, in
    the event of his removal, anytime soon.  In reality the ongoing
    communications would be by way of internet and social communications
    and indeed the appellant accepts that he has been in FaceTime
    communications, when he has not visited them every day, during the
    COVID pandemic.

61. However, I find that the availability of FaceTime and other internet
    communication would not suffice for the kind of support and care that
    is required for each of the three children separately and also in
    combination.  By way of just one practical example, the children
    require supervision with day-to-day tasks, for example cleaning their
    teeth, and this is simply not something that can be done remotely.  I
    find that the only realistic alternative scenario, in the event of the
    appellant's deportation, would be for MD to arrange some sort of
    respite or domiciliary care, with the assistance of the local authority
    and social services in the UK.  MD explained that she had never had any
    social services or local authority involvement in the home setting as
    she had coped during the appellant's imprisonment just by herself and
    had a reluctance to do so, given the children's lack of confidence with
    strangers and her unwillingness to have strangers in the home setting.

62. That being said and notwithstanding the appellant's important role, in
    the event of the appellant's deportation, Dr Farooqi does not go so far
    as to say that a replacement domiciliary care provision could not
    provide adequate care, supplementing the support of MD who would not be
    able to cope on her own (paragraph [48] refers to it being very
    difficult for one person to manage on their own). Rather, O and his
    siblings might find domiciliary arrangements, in combination with
    respite care, difficult to tolerate, because they prefer people they
    are familiar with and do not like change;  and "it is not worth taking
    the risk as they have their father to assist their mother to care for
    them."  While I in no way criticise the quality of Dr Farooq's
    assessment, read literally, whether it is "not worth taking the risk"
    to arrange domiciliary care is not for Dr Farooq for to comment on;
    rather, I infer from that any domiciliary care arrangements, to help MD
    cope, may prove challenging for the children and is not without risk,
    it terms of whether the arrangements would prove successful or not.

63. The appellant's removal, given the childrens' emotional dependency him
    and the stability of the setting in which he plays a central role,
    would mean a real loss to the children in terms of their emotional
    development, although I do not go so far as to find that it would
    result in a drop in their educational attainment or welfare, absent any
    domiciliary care arrangements failing. A number of the educational
    reports are years out of date (going back as far as 2012), but of the
    most recent ones, relevant to the period when the appellant was in
    prison from April 2017 to December 2019,  do not support the
    proposition that their behaviour or welfare would deteriorate because
    of the appellant's absence in the future, even if permanent.  Based on
    the past experience when the appellant was in prison (and acknowledging
    that MD only barely coped for that temporary period),  A's school
    report at page [33] describes his "excellent progress" in the Autumn
    term of 2018, and in his general progress, he is described as having
    "settled well into his new class" in a report dated 7th June 2019 at
    page [28], with school attendance at 99%, all when the appellant
    remained in prison and the children had had no face-to-face contact
    with the appellant.

64. O's transition report dated 25th March 2019, while detailing his
    complex needs, does not suggest a deterioration in behaviour,
    attainment or engagement and indeed describes him as someone who "is a
    pleasant young man who engaged well with the SLT [presumably the senior
    leadership team]) in a one-to-one environment" (page [23]).

65. Potentially the most mixed evidence is in respect of C, whose behaviour
    is described by the paediatric doctor as becoming more aggressive since
    December 2018, which ties in with C's first epileptic episode (page
    [16] of the supplementary bundle) and her amended final Educational,
    Health and Care Plan, finalised in February 2020, but with input
    November 2018 and July 2019 from those doctors treating C for epilepsy,
    which refers at page [103] to C hurting children and staff when upset
    and this is "increasing at the moment", with a younger child pushed
    over, and that she "can be aggressive" and tries to "hit other people
    sometimes".  Nevertheless. the evidence is consistent with changed
    behaviours linked to C's epileptic condition and there is no reference
    to changed behaviours because of the appellant's prolonged absence.

The obstacles to the appellant's integration in Nigeria

66. Finally, in relation to the appellant's connections with Nigeria and
    any obstacles to his integration in that country, on the first point,
    even on his own case, he entered the UK in 1992, having been born in
    1963, so having spent the formative years of his life and into
    adulthood, aged 29, including being educated to degree level in that
    country.  Whilst the appellant has confirmed that he continues with a
    good relationship with at least three siblings, sisters who are married
    in that country, and has, on his evidence, a close relationship with
    them, on the basis of his current age of 58, his time spent in the UK;
    his loss of friendships and networks, and the inability of his sisters
    to help hm because they are married, he asserts that he would not be
    able to integrate into Nigeria.

67. Contrary to the appellant's evidence, I find that the appellant would
    not be returning to Nigeria as an "outsider", in the sense of SSHD v
    Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813.  While he has been absent from Nigeria
    since at least 2005, his facility to reintegrate is reflected in a
    number of areas. He volunteered as a Yoruba interpreter for Detention
    Action in 2020 and is at least bilingual. He is educated to degree
    level and has, albeit unlawfully, carried out a number of jobs whilst
    in the UK as well as receiving numerous additional training and
    qualifications whilst in prison, which are too long to list, but
    include everything from learning French; project management; entry-
    level journalism; using spreadsheets; property and planning; to web-
    design.   He wishes to study psychology to degree-level (the OASys
    report refers to this at page [44]).  In essence, he is already at
    graduate level with substantial work experience and qualifications and
    is plainly an intelligent man, with an endlessly inquisitive nature. He
    is not easily lead, but is driven and is capable of planning and
    execution of complex projects, even if he has, misguidedly, applied
    those skills to large-scale fraud and money laundering.  He has not
    indicated any health or other conditions that would be obstacles to his
    integration in Nigeria, stating to the OASys author that he has no
    depression, anxiety, or substance dependency issues. While he referred,
    as a single health matter, to high-blood pressure, which has
    normalised, albeit for which he is taking unspecified medication (page
    [44]), there is no evidence of his blood pressure being an obstacle to
    integration.   I am unable to make any more detailed findings because
    of the absence of detailed evidence in relation to the appellant's
    siblings in Nigeria, but it is reasonable to conclude, given their
    closeness, that their marriages alone would not be a barrier to their
    supporting him initially, and even if they were not able to do so, just
    as he received financial support from friends while in prison (page
    [42] of the OASys report refers) and he is without any debts, such
    support could continue, at least in the short term, in Nigeria.  In
    that context, I find that the appellant would be able to re-enter
    Nigerian culture, albeit after a significant period of time absent, as
    a healthy, highly educated and motived person, with substantial work
    experience in the UK, and with some support from siblings in Nigeria
    and friends from the UK.

The Law

68. It is not appropriate to recite lengthy passages from the law.  Rather,
    I set out the relevant statutory provisions, without gloss, and the
    core principles.

69. Sections 117A to D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    provide:

             "PART 5A

             Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations

             117A Application of this Part

             (1)  This Part applies where a court or tribunal is required
             to determine whether a decision made under the Immigration
             Acts-

                  (a)  breaches a person's right to respect for private and
                  family life under Article 8, and

                  (b)  as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the
                  Human Rights Act 1998.

             (2)  In considering the public interest question, the court or
             tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

                  (a)  in all cases, to the considerations listed in section
                  117B, and

                  (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign
                  criminals, to the considerations listed in section 117C.

             (3)  In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means
             the question of whether an interference with a person's right
             to respect for private and family life is justified under
             Article 8(2).




             117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in
             all cases

             (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
             the public interest.

             (2)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
             interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak English, because persons who can speak
             English-

                  (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

             (3)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
             interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-

                  (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

             (4)  Little weight should be given to-

                  (a)  a private life, or

                  (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the person is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

             (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life
             established by a person at a time when the person's
             immigration status is precarious.

             (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
             the public interest does not require the person's removal
             where-

                  (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

                  (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                  leave the United Kingdom.




             117C Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving
             foreign criminals

             (1)  The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
             interest.

             (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign
             criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of
             the criminal.

             (3)  In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more,
             the public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception
             1 or Exception 2 applies.

             (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

                  (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom
                  for most of C's life,

                  (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                  Kingdom, and

                  (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to be
                  deported.

             (5)  Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
             relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.

             (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced
             to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public
             interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1
             and 2.

             (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be
             taken into account where a court or tribunal is considering a
             decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that
             the reason for the decision was the offence or offences for
             which the criminal has been convicted."

70. There is an increasing scale of hurdles that a person has to meet, in
    order to succeed in a human rights appeal, ranging from a person who is
    not liable to deportation at all, who may succeed on the basis of
    Section 117B(6), to the most significant hurdle for foreign criminals
    who have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or
    more, as in the appellant's case, namely very compelling circumstances
    over and above 'Exception 1' and 'Exception 2'.  I can nevertheless
    consider such circumstances through the lens of both Exceptions, but,
    for example, it would be wrong to conflate 'Exception 2' ("unduly
    harsh") with "very compelling circumstances".

71. Noting the authorities to which I have been referred of HA (Iraq) v
    SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 1176; AA (Nigeria) v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 1296;
    and KB (Jamaica) v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 1385, when considering "unduly
    harsh", it is important to move away from notions of exceptionality or
    an objectively measurable baseline of the "ordinary" effects of
    deportation on "any" child. Every assessment of "unduly harsh" must
    have as its focus the effects on the specific relevant children, taking
    into account their best interests.  The wording "unduly harsh" reflects
    Section 117C(1), that the deportation of foreign criminals is in the
    public interest, so it does not start off as a neutral evaluation, but
    in the context of that public interest, the focus remains on the
    effects on the children.  Unduly harsh effects may be common place and
    are highly fact-specific, particularly as they centre on the effects on
    individual children, including (but only as examples and not as a 'tick-
    list') their ages; educational and emotional needs; and the role played
    by the potential deportee parent.

72. In the assessment of "very compelling circumstances", which reflects
    the strong public interest in deportation, such a public interest still
    has a moveable quality, i.e. the public interest may not have the same
    weight for all serious foreign criminals; "public revulsion" is too
    emotive a concept to be weighed in the assessment of such public
    interest, but the public interest in deterrence remains a relevant
    factor; and at its heart, it is helpful to assess very compelling
    circumstances through the "balance-sheet" approach, weighing on the one
    hand, the factors in the appellant's favour, holistically, against the
    strong (but not immovable) public interest in deportation.  Factors
    which can be relevant (although of varying weights and which again are
    examples, and not an exhaustive list) include: the nature of the
    offence (for example, whether it includes an element of violence), its
    seriousness and the appellant's role in the offence, as often reflected
    in the sentencing Judge's remarks; the extent of rehabilitation and
    likelihood of reoffending; the delay, as in this case, in resolution of
    an earlier application for leave to remain (relating to the public
    interest in the maintenance of effective immigration controls); the
    depth of the appellant's integration in the UK and quality of his
    relations with his children; whether his relationship could be
    sustained after his removal; the need to promote the childrens'
    welfare; and the obstacles to the appellant's integration in Nigeria
    (noting that this is a broad evaluative assessment, with the concept of
    being "insider" meaning the appellant having enough of an understanding
    of how Nigeria works to be able to participate in it, be accepted
    within it, operate day-to-day and build up a network of relationships
    there). I note the guidance in the Strasbourg line of authorities such
    as �ner v The Netherlands (2006) 45 EHRR 14 (in particular, paragraph
    [57]) and Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47, in terms of the factors that
    I might consider.

73. Even if there are very compelling circumstances, I then need to
    consider the wider Section 117B factors.

Discussion and conclusions

'Exception 1'

74. Considering the human rights appeal through the lens of 'Exception 1',
    the respondent has already accepted that the appellant remains
    integrated within UK society.  The appeal is principally focussed on
    the appellant's,family life although he will no doubt have friends and
    acquaintances in the UK.  There is correspondence from a church on 12th
    January 2009 (page [B9]) addressed "to whom it may concern", enclosed
    with his 2009 application, asserting the appellant's regular church
    attendance between 1995 to 2009, although there is no further reference
    to church attendance to which I have been directed and the appellant
    informed the OASys assessor 2018 that he is "not really a social
    person" (page [42]). I find that the appellant's circle of friends is
    correspondingly likely to be more limited than the church
    correspondence, which is over a decade old and not supported by any
    witness statement from a church supporter or attendance at the Hearing
    by anyone from the church, might otherwise suggest.

75. I find that the appellant's social network in the UK is likely to be
    limited and focussed on his children, albeit with enough of friendship
    group to have received financial support while in prison, from unnamed
    friends.  In the context of the appellant's private life, the appellant
    has not been in the UK lawfully beyond the expiry of his visit visa on
    1992 and so has not been in the UK lawfully for most of his life.  Even
    on his own case, he did not seek to regularise his status until 2007,
    aged 44 (he is now 59) and so cannot meet that element of Exception 1.
    The appellant also does not meet the third limb of Exception 1, namely
    there are not any real obstacles, let alone very significant obstacles
    to his integration in Nigeria, for reasons I have set out, even had he
    lived in the UK continuously since 1992, (which I do not find as a
    reliable fact) but, as I find more likely, he has been in the UK on and
    off since that date and continuously since 2005.   The appellant is
    intelligent, resourceful, educated in a very wide range of areas,
    including to graduate level, with extensive work experience; with
    friends who were willing to provide him financial support while in
    prison, and siblings whom I find would be willing to assist him, at
    least in the short-term, in Nigeria; and no health issues presenting
    any obstacles to his integration.   He does not begin to satisfy
    Exception 1, even noting that he remains integrated in the UK.

'Exception 2'

76. In relation to the appellant's family life, the respondent now accepts
    that the appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
    with O, A and C. The "go" option for the children is not viable and the
    question is whether the "stay" option will have unduly harsh effects on
    the children. This requires consideration not only of the circumstances
    in the event of the appellant's removal but consideration of the
    "status quo".

77. In the context of whether the test of "unduly harsh" is met, as already
    noted, while I take as my starting point that deportation of foreign
    criminals, of whom the appellant is one, is in the public interest, I
    do not then go on to consider the precise nature of the appellant's
    offending when considering the effect on the appellant's children.  I
    also accept, and the respondent has not substantively disputed, that
    the best interests of the children, for the purposes of Section 55 of
    the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, are for the "status
    quo" to be maintained.  (I should add that the respondent does not
    accept that the appellant is a role-model to his children, as a fully
    rehabilitated ex-offender). Such best interests reflect the critical
    role that the appellant, albeit as a non-resident father, plays, in his
    support for O, A and C, children with complex educational, emotional
    and development needs; and the fact that the effect of deportation
    would result in a permanent physical separation between the appellant
    and the children, which no social communication could hope to repair,
    given the appellant's role.   This is consistent with Dr Farooqi's
    conclusion.

78. However, I am also conscious, when assessing whether the effects of
    deportation are "unduly harsh", that the best interests of O, A and C,
    while weighty, do not answer that question.  I also agree with Ms
    Griffith's submission that it is not a complete answer to the question,
    to say that because MD coped during the appellant's period of
    imprisonment, without any support or intervention from social services
    or any obvious deterioration in the chidrens' safety and education,
    that the effects of deportation and permanent separation would not be
    unduly harsh. Whilst Ms Griffiths accepted that it remains appropriate
    that I consider mitigating strategies (such as support from social
    services in the future) and the extent to which MD was able to cope in
    the past, that was for a temporary (albeit extended) period and it
    ignores the childrens' emotional development.  I am also conscious that
    time has since moved on and Dr Farooqi makes clear, in assessing the
    situation since the appellant's release, that the children are at such
    an age and their needs are sufficiently complex, that MD could not cope
    on her own and that some form of permanent domiciliary or temporary
    respite care would need to be provided and its success would not be
    without risk. While that risk is not quantified and the consequences of
    domiciliary or respite care proving unsuccessful are not elaborated on,
    it is possible to infer that at least one possibility might mean
    greater intervention, such as non-domiciliary or respite care, i.e.
    permanent care away from the home setting, although in making that
    inference, I do so with caution, as there has been no prior social
    services involvement or professional care, even when the appellant was
    in prison for 32 months.   Even if that risk is minimal, I accept Ms
    Griffiths' powerful submission that to replace the appellant as a key
    person in the children's lives, will have a material impact beyond a
    question of safety, childcare and education, to the childrens'
    emotional development, at important stages of their lives.  Even if the
    risk of any replacement arrangement failing is low, I accept that,
    while finely balanced, that the effect of the replacement of the
    appellant in these circumstances with a professional carer or carers,
    and never seeing the appellant in person again, (albeit maintaining a
    relationship via the internet) would have an unduly harsh effect on O,
    A and C, given their particular attachment to him; their need for
    stability and security; their lack of confidence with strangers; and
    their complex needs. In summary, the appellant, just about, satisfies
    Exception 2.

Are there very compelling circumstances over and above those described in
Exceptions 1 and 2?

79. In terms of an analysis under "very compelling circumstances," I
    conducted a balance sheet approach.  I have considered both private and
    family life.

80. In relation to both private and family life, I considered the fact of
    the delay by the respondent in reaching a decision on the appellant's
    May 2007 application, until the refusal decision of October 2018.
    Noting the authority of CI (Nigeria) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 2027, I
    considered whether it was appropriate to attach little weight to the
    appellant's private life established when he was present in the UK
    unlawfully or without a right of permanent residence, in the context of
    the delay.  In the case of CI, the appellant was a minor and the delay
    related to the lack of resolution to the question of settled status.
    Even if one accepts that the appellant cannot be criticised for failing
    to pursue the application (and making no reference to it in subsequent
    applications), as I discussed with Ms Griffiths, the question was how
    the appellant's particular circumstances (i.e. his repeated criminal
    offending involving dishonesty) might impact on any application, had it
    been considered more timeously.

81. By May 2007, the date of his application, the appellant had already
    been offending over a period of at least four years (since 2001); on
    his own account, he had used deception between 2001/2 to work until
    2006 (albeit not necessarily continuously), prior to seeking to
    regularise his status for which he later received a sentence of six
    month's in prison in 2008; as well as receiving the fine in 2005 and
    conviction, only a month after his May 2007 application, for a further
    deception offence. The offending from 2001 to 2006 and conviction in
    2005 were prior to the appellant's relationship with MD and were not
    committed to support MD or O.  Whilst the appellant seeks to argue that
    his lack of lawful status reflects the delay in considering his
    application from 2007, on his own case he has never had settled leave
    to remain in the UK and in light of his criminal offending on an
    extended basis, over many years in the period up to the 2007
    application, this is a far different case from CI, relating to an
    application for indefinite leave to remain made on behalf of a minor
    appellant, who at the time was blameless. Here, the appellant had, on
    his own account, already been in the UK for many years before seeking
    to regularise his status after his initial entry; and he committed a
    number of criminal offences before (and he continued to after) the 2007
    application.  It is therefore highly doubtful that the appellant would
    ever have been granted settled status, either in 2007, or in later
    applications (one of which he now accepts included deliberately
    untruthful information), in the circumstances of his offending.  While
    the 2007 application may have been forgotten about by both parties for
    over a decade, and to that extent it may have a bearing on the
    maintenance of immigration control, I regard it as appropriate to
    reduce the weight of the public interest in immigration control (as
    distinct from the public interest in deporting foreign criminals) by
    only a very limited amount, as a result of the delay in resolution of
    the 2007 application.

82. In relation to the appellant's private life, in his favour, the
    appellant is on a journey of rehabilitating himself; and his chances of
    reoffending are low.  Even if he has not been in the UK continuously
    since 1992, it is quite possible that he has spent a large part of the
    period in the UK since then, and continuously since 2005, and he
    remains integrated in UK society, albeit he describes himself as "not
    really a sociable person".  He has undertaken various courses and
    volunteering roles, largely, it appears, within the prison and
    immigration detention environment.

83. Against this is the fact that there are no real obstacles to his
    integration in Nigeria, for the reasons already set out. There is no
    evidence that the appellant's rehabilitation would be affected by his
    deportation to Nigeria (on his own case, he claims to be fully
    rehabilitated). Despite the fact that there has been a delay in
    considering the 2007 application, I attach limited weight to the
    appellant's private life developed in the UK.  He speaks English (a
    neutral factor); and has a capacity to work, but against the strong
    weight of the public interest in deporting a serious foreign criminal,
    even one not involving an offence of violence or drugs, but one which
    nevertheless involved a breach of trust, the appellant being the ring-
    leader and attempting to encourage others in the crime, the factors in
    the appellant's favour do not begin to outweigh the strong public
    interest in deportation.  There is nothing by way of separate or
    additional circumstances which make the appellant's circumstances very
    compelling, over and above those set out in Exception 1, in relation to
    the appellant's private life.  The appellant's appeal in relation to
    right to respect for his private life therefore fails.

84. In relation to the appellant's family life, in the appellant's favour,
    once again, I take into account the positive factors the appellant is
    unlikely to reoffend, even if the lack of offending is for a limited
    period in the context of a far longer period of offending since 2001
    until his most recent offending ended in 2014 and he has made real
    steps to rehabilitate himself, although the weight I attach to that
    rehabilitation is limited (but it has some weight) in that his
    rehabilitation reflects no more than the behaviour that society
    expects.

85. Also, in the appellant's favour, the appellant's prison sentence was
    for four years, rather than a longer sentence and did not involve
    violence or other offences against the person or drugs.  In addition,
    to some extent, the respondent's delay in resolving the appellant's
    2007 application does, to a small degree, reduce the public interest in
    immigration control although I should add that that is separate from
    the issue of the public interest in deportation of foreign criminals.
    I attach very significant weight to the best interest of O, A and C in
    the status quo being maintained and the appellant being allowed to
    remain in the country to be involved in their lives, not only to
    provide a caring role but to nurture their personal and emotional
    development, and I also consider again that the appellant meets (just),
    'Exception 1', namely the effect of the appellant's deportation on O, A
    and C would be unduly harsh.   They are at important stages of
    development, including O, who is moving into adulthood.

86. Nevertheless, weighing against all of this is the strong public
    interest in deportation of the appellant as a serious foreign criminal.
     While his sentence only just crosses that 'serious' threshold, he was
    the ringleader; he encouraged others to commit the complex and
    sophisticated fraud, which was on a large scale, involving money-
    laundering, over a period of many years, making substantial personal
    gains of tens of thousands of pounds, in a widely-publicised offence;
    and whilst deportation is not in the context of the appellant being a
    persistent offender, and the focus is on the most serious offence, it
    would be artificial to ignore the context of his last sentence,
    relating to the fourth set of convictions for 11 offences over a
    number of years in the period between 2001 to 2014, all involving
    dishonesty, of increasing seriousness. I accept that against the
    appellant, focussing on the most recent offence, I should place more
    than minor weight on the public interest in deterrence (see: MS
    (s.117C(6): "very compelling circumstances") Philippines [2019] UKUT
    00122 (IAC)).

87. I also take into account that while there are risks (albeit
    unquantified by Dr Farooqi) of an alternative professional care
    arrangement for O, A and C not succeeding, as Ms Griffiths accepted,
    the extent to which alternative domiciliary care arrangements would
    mitigate the effects on the children of the appellant's deportation
    remains a relevant factor, even if the effect is "unduly harsh."  I do
    not accept Ms Griffiths' submission that the totality of the childrens'
    needs or their needs individually, coupled with the wider role that the
    appellant plays beyond merely that of a carer, in nurturing their
    emotional development, tips the effect of deportation (as she
    submitted) beyond "unduly harsh" to become very compelling.  Indeed, I
    regard the proper focus as being on the totality of the circumstances,
    and not an incremental approach. On the totality of the circumstances,
    there is a viable option, albeit not without risk, of appropriate
    domiciliary care arrangements being put into place to assist MD
    successfully to meet the childrens' welfare and educational needs both
    individually and collectively, which while undoubtedly not in the best
    interests of those children; and unduly harsh, (in the context of
    likely permanent separation from their father who plays a key role in
    their lives) nevertheless remains a viable option. I do not
    underestimate the loss to the children of the appellant in their
    emotional development, beyond basic caring and educational needs, which
    remote communications will never replace, but I also take into account
    the lack of evidence of a worsening of the childrens' welfare and
    educational development, when the appellant was previously absence
    between April 2017 and December 2019, without any social services
    support at all and the fact that some form of a relationship between
    the appellant and his children will continue. Taking into account all
    of the factors I have considered in this decision, these do no not, in
    my view, outweigh the strong public interest in this appellant's
    deportation as a serious foreign criminal.

88. In the circumstances, there are not "very compelling circumstances" in
    this case, and the respondent's refusal of the appellant's human rights
    claim does not breach the appellant's right to respect for his family
    life.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Chana (the 'FtT'), promulgated on 4 October 2019, by
    which she dismissed his appeal against the respondent's refusal of his
    human rights claim, in the context of a deportation order having been
    made against him on 17 October 2018.

 2. In essence, the appellant's claims involved the following issues: in
    relation to his family life, whether the applicant had a genuine and
    subsisting parental relationship with his British citizen children and
    step-son; and if he did,  whether it would be unduly harsh for them to
    remain in the UK without the appellant for the purposes of paragraph
    399(a); and in relation to his private life, noting that he had never
    had lawful leave to enter or remain in the UK, whether there would be
    very significant obstacles to his integration into Nigeria, his country
    of origin; and noting both his family and private life, whether there
    were very compelling circumstances over and above those described in
    paragraph 399 and 399A. There are associated provisions described as
    "exception 1" and "exception 2" in section 117C of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The core points taken by the respondent were that the appellant had a
    number of criminal convictions. Most recently, the appellant was
    convicted in 2014 and sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years, for fraud.
    The sentencing judge described as the appellant  as being at the
    "centre of this conspiracy", which was "a very serious and
    sophisticated and repeated conspiracy," which the appellant had been
    able to perpetrate as he had inside knowledge of the corporate victim,
    Southern Rail, as one of its former employees.

The FtT's decision

 4. The FtT dealt with a preliminary issue of the appellant's adjournment
    application, which she refused on the basis that while the appellant
    wished to instruct an independent social worker in relation to the
    impact on his children of his removal, the FtT believed she could make
    an assessment of the best interests of those children without the need
    for such evidence.

 5. The appellant accepted that he no longer was in a relationship with his
    former partner.  The FtT did not accept that the appellant had a
    subsisting relationship with his children, noting that he had not seen
    them since 6 April 2017 and had exaggerated the extent of his telephone
    contact with them, which was limited to less than 4 hours in a period
    of over two and a half years ([53] and [61] of the FtT's decision), and
    that it would be in the best interests of the appellant's children that
    they remain in the UK while he was returned to Nigeria ([63]).  In
    relation to the appellant's private life, while he had developed a
    private life in the UK in the 20 years that he had been present (albeit
    unlawfully) in the UK, the FtT noted his repeat offending; the
    aggregate period of imprisonment of 6 years; and his continuing ties to
    Nigeria.

 6. Having considered the evidence as a whole, the FtT refused the
    appellant's appeal.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on six grounds, in respect of
    permission for which only two were granted on the papers by a Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal, Judge Kelly; which are that the FtT arguably
    erred in declining to adjourn the hearing when an independent social
    worker had already accepted instructions; and in making an error of
    fact that the aggregate period of the appellant's prison sentences was
    six years, when it was only four and a half.

 8. The appellant made in time application to renew her grounds of appeal
    in relation to grounds 3 to 6, which are as follows:

      a) Ground (3) - by rejecting the appellant's claimed rehabilitation
         solely on the basis of his oral evidence, specifically his apparent
         attempt to minimise or deny his responsibility to the FtT, the FtT
         failed to consider, as per the authority of AM v SSHD [2012] EWCA
         Civ 1634, that rehabilitation may not accompanied by a full
         confession;

      b) Ground (4) - the FtT made conflicting findings about the existence
         of family life between the appellant and his children and had
         misdirected herself on the extent to which, even if there were
         limited access rights, the appellant may still have a genuine and
         subsisting parental relationship with his children, see: SR
         (subsisting parental relationship - s117B(6)) Pakistan [2018] UKUT
         00334);

      c) Ground (5) - the FtT failed to consider whether there were very
         compelling circumstances over and above those described in
         paragraphs 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules;

      d) Ground (6) - the FtT failed to consider relevant factors,
         specifically the appellant's children's behavioural and
         developmental needs; and separately, the respondent's 11-year delay
         in determining the appellant's application for leave to remain UK,
         made in July 2007.

The Law

 9. On the issue of the FtT's refusal to adjourn the hearing, the FtT
    needed to consider not only whether the appellant had demonstrated a
    good reason for postponing the hearing, but also whether the appellant
    was deprived of a fair hearing - see SH (Afghanistan) v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 1284 and Nwaigwe
    (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC).

10. On ground (2), the aggregate length of the appellant's prison sentences
    is relevant to a proportionality assessment- see: RA (s.117C: "unduly
    harsh"; offence: seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 00123 (IAC).

11. On ground (6), the delay in the respondent's consideration of the
    appellant's application for leave to remain on human rights grounds is
    relevant in considering whether there are very compelling
    circumstances, for the purposes of paragraph 399 and 399A - see CI
    (Nigeria) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 2027.

Discussion on error of law

12. I granted the renewed application for permission in respect of grounds
    (3) to (6), as not only did I regard them as disclosing arguable errors
    of law, but in fact for reasons I will come on to discuss, I regarded
    all of the grounds as being sustained and amounting to errors of law,
    such that the FtT's decision cannot stand.  I will therefore deal with
    each of the errors of law in turn in relation to grounds (1) to (6).

Ground (1)

13. This was the ground relating to the FtT's refusal to adjourn the
    hearing, noting the well-known authorities of SH (Afghanistan) v SSHD
    [2011] EWCA Civ 1284 and Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT
    00418 (IAC).

14. I am very conscious that for any judge, the question of whether to
    grant an adjournment application, particularly one made late, can be
    finely balanced and any conclusion that such a refusal amounts to an
    error of law requires clear reasons for doing so.  The test is a two
    stage one and in particular, not only must the judge ask themselves
    whether there is an adequate explanation for the need to adjourn the
    hearing but more importantly, whether a refusal to adjourn would result
    in the appellant otherwise being deprived of a fair hearing.

15. At [25] of her decision, the FtT noted that the basis of the
    application was because the appellant needed time to obtain expert
    evidence of an independent social worker about the impact on the
    appellant's children of his separation from them.  The social worker
    had agreed to accept instructions and funding was in place to provide
    the report.  The timeframe in which such a report would be produced was
    not lengthy (the end of October 2019, a few weeks after the hearing).
    The respondent objected, saying that the appellant did not have a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship with his children and
    therefore in the circumstances, a report was unnecessary ([26]).

16. The FtT's reasons at [27] record that the she refused to adjourn the
    hearing as she believed that she could make an assessment of the
    children's best interests without the need for a report.  She noted
    that the appellant's children were aged between 10 and 16 years' old
    and had been looked after by their mother, while the appellant was in
    prison, without his assistance.

17. There are two aspects to the way in which the FtT erred in her
    decision.  First, I accept Ms Solanki's submission that the children
    were old enough, certainly in relation to the oldest child, aged 16, to
    be able to provide their own views to a social worker as to the impact
    of their father's removal on them.  Bearing in mind that this is a case
    which focuses centrally on the consequences of the separation of the
    appellant from his children and whether those circumstances would
    amount to very compelling circumstances over and above those outlined
    in exceptions 1 and 2 of section 117C(6) of the 2002 Act; and the
    evidence was readily available in a short period after the date of
    hearing, I regarded the FtT's decision to proceed in the absence of
    that evidence as depriving the appellant of a fair hearing.

18. Second, it also presupposed the correctness of the respondent's
    assertion that because the appellant had not seen his children since
    2017, it followed that the appellant was not in a genuine and
    subsisting parental relationship with them.  This went to the heart of
    the appeal and went beyond whether there should be an adjournment.  The
    FtT referred to the children being looked after by their mother and
    whilst there was not an express conclusion about the absence of a
    paternal parental relationship, the FtT's conclusion that she could
    consider the best interests of the children without the report implied
    that nothing of relevance would be in a report because of the absence
    of such a subsisting relationship.  The expert's report was relevant
    not only to the children's views and their best interests, but also to
    the other issue that a social worker might be able to shed light on,
    ie. whether there was in fact such a parental relationship.

19. In the circumstances, whilst I regard a decision to adjourn as being a
    nuanced and often a very difficult decision for a judge, nevertheless,
    in these circumstances, I do regard the FtT's refusal to adjourn the
    hearing as depriving the appellant of a fair hearing and in the
    circumstances, it did amount to an error of law.

Ground (2)

20. I accept Ms Solanki's submission that the FtT had erred when referring
    to a total of six years' imprisonment for separate offences, and in
    fairness to Ms Bassi, she did not dispute this but instead asked me to
    consider that the FtT had also clearly referred to a period of
    imprisonment for the most recent offence of four years.  Nevertheless,
    the FtT clearly approached her assessment by way of an aggregate of
    sentences, as referred to at [19] and [49].  I noted that the weight to
    be attached to any criminal offending might be by reference to the
    prison sentences concerned, (see RA (s.117C: "unduly harsh"; offence:
    seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 00123 (IAC). This factual error (the
    appellant's aggregate sentences total four and a half years) meant that
    any proportionality exercise in the context of very compelling
    circumstances was necessarily flawed. Bearing in mind that a
    proportionality assessment may be very finely balanced, I concluded
    that this was one which amounted to a material error of law.

Ground (3)

21. I accept on the one hand, as outlined again by the authority of RA,
    that the question of rehabilitation may often be of limited value in
    the proportionality exercise.  On the other hand, I accept the force of
    Ms Solanki's submissions that there were still material errors of law
    on two grounds. The first was the FtT's focus on the appellant's lack
    of remorse before her and/or an attempt to disassociate himself from
    his responsibility for his offending, as meaning that there had been a
    lack of rehabilitation.  By reference to the AM authority, I do accept
    that rehabilitation may not be accompanied by a full admission and in
    particular, where the appellant was before the FtT in relation to a
    connected, albeit a different matter, namely his human rights appeal,
    he may have difficulty and even embarrassment about repeating an
    acceptance of criminal culpability once again.  The FtT did err in
    focussing on this, in contrast to the limited focus on the professional
    assessment in the OASys report, which was the second error.  While the
    question of rehabilitation may be of limited weight, it may have some
    weight, as confirmed in RA.  In a case such as this which focuses on a
    finely balanced proportionality exercise in the context of very
    compelling circumstances, I cannot rule out the materiality of
    rehabilitation.  A flawed assessment of rehabilitation does, therefore,
    amount to a material error of law.

Ground (4)

22. I accept the submission that the FtT's findings on the existence of
    family life between the appellant and his children contradicted the
    findings of no subsisting parental relationship between them.

23. The second error was the FtT's failure to consider the test in relation
    to paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules and section 117C of the 2002
    Act, namely whether there was a genuine and subsisting parental
    relationship. The FtT's focus had been on the limited telephone contact
    and the absence of face-to-face contact between the appellant and his
    children. However, as confirmed by the authority of SR (subsisting
    parental relationship - s117B(6)) Pakistan, to which I have already
    referred, there may be an absence of direct parental responsibility and
    in fact very limited parental contact but nevertheless still be a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship.  That was particularly
    material where, as here, the appellant was in prison and it is said
    that the children would not be able to have face-to-face contact and
    may have had limited telephone contact because of their behavioural
    conditions which would have rendered such contact, whilst the appellant
    remained in prison, as inappropriate, but which might resume on the
    appellant's release from prison.

24. In those circumstances, the analysis of the genuine and subsisting
    parental relationship was flawed and as it went to the heart of this
    case, resulted in a material error of law.

Ground (5)

25. Notwithstanding Ms Solanki not making submissions on this ground, I do
    regard the FtT's lack of analysis of paragraph 398 to 399A and section
    117C of the 2002 Act, and instead the FtT making a freestanding
    analysis of family life outside the Rules, as an error of law.  Where
    paragraphs 398 to 399A and section 117C apply, a separate article 8
    analysis was regarded as unnecessary in RA.  The FtT's free-standing
    article 8 assessment, instead of an assessment by reference to the
    applicable Rules and statutory provisions, did contribute to the errors
    made the FtT (for example, the contradictory findings in relation to
    family life and the existence of a subsisting parental relationship).



Ground (6)

26. There were two issues which the FtT was said not to have considered:
    first, the appellant's childrens' behavioural and developmental needs;
    and second, the respondent's eleven-year delay in reaching a decision
    on the appellant's application for leave to remain.  Dealing in reverse
    order, the 11-year delay was clearly referred to in the appellant's
    skeleton argument before the FtT, a copy of which Ms Solanki provided
    to me.  I noted the authority of CI (Nigeria), which made clear that
    the delay in determining a human rights appeal, in that case of less
    than ten years, was relevant to very compelling circumstances because
    it may well have been that a period of overstaying could have been
    resolved at an earlier stage and that in turn then has a potential
    impact on the weight attached to the appellant's family and private
    life in this case.  I say no more because in terms of a remaking
    decision, what weight is attached eventually is a matter in that re-
    making decision, but what was clear in the decision of CI (Nigeria) was
    that that is a matter of weight to be considered in the proportionality
    assessment. It was not considered by the FtT, and that amounts to an
    error of law.

27. Dealing finally with the appellant's childrens' behavioural and
    developmental needs, I accept Ms Solanki's submission that they were
    core to this appeal, in the context of very compelling circumstances.
    I also accept her submission that whilst there were brief references to
    them (at [32] and [60]), the gist of the FtT's conclusion was that
    because the appellant's former partner had been able to cope as their
    sole carer during the appellant's imprisonment, it followed that she
    would continue to be able to do so. Her analysis in relation to the
    best interests of the children was limited to that.  I accept the
    central submission that it is by no means the only question to be asked
    in considering whether it would be unduly harsh for the appellant's
    children to be separated from their father.  Where, as in this case, it
    was said that the appellant had been a resident father prior to his
    imprisonment, there has to be a wider consideration of the impact if he
    were permanently removed from this country. The FtT's failure to do so
    amounts to a further error of law.



Decision on error of law

28. I conclude that there are errors in the FtT's decision such that it
    must be set aside.  I set it aside, without preservation of any
    findings of fact.

Disposal

29. With reference to paragraph 7.2 of the Practice Direction, while there
    are no preserved findings, given the limited scope of the issues, it is
    appropriate that the Upper Tribunal remakes the FtT's decision, which
    has been set aside.





Directions

30. In terms of directions, the following directions will apply to the
    future conduct of this appeal:

      a) The Resumed Hearing will be listed before an Upper Tribunal Judge,
         (if available, Judge Keith) at Field House on the first available
         date after 1 March 2020, time estimate three hours, to enable the
         Upper Tribunal to substitute a decision to either allow or dismiss
         the appeal.

In terms of the remainder of the directions:

      b) The appellant shall on or before 4pm on 17 February 2020 produce
         the independent social worker expert report relied upon in respect
         of which permission to adduce new evidence under Rule 15(2A) is
         granted.

      c) I also grant permission under Rule 15(2A) for the following
         additional categories of evidence to be admitted, provide that they
         are produced by the appellant to the respondent not less than
         fourteen days before the Resumed Hearing, specifically: witness
         statements from the appellant and his former partner;
         correspondence from the children's schools; and correspondence in
         relation to the appellant's recent volunteering activities, noting
         that in relation to the children the anonymity direction will
         continue to apply.

      d) Skeleton arguments to be produced seven days before the hearing.

    The anonymity directions continue to apply.
