Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr P. Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Ms V. Lovejoy, Counsel, instructed by Fletcher
Dervish, Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination  of  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Aujla who  allowed  the  appeal  of  Mr  Kalonji
       against the decision of the appellant to make  a  deportation  order
       against him on 13 May 2013.  I  shall  revert  to  referring  to  Mr
       Kalonji as 'the appellant' as he was before the First-tier Tribunal.


    2.  The appellant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo  who
       was born on 9 April 1988. He arrived in the United Kingdom on 7  May
       1995 with his mother and siblings  at  the  age  of  seven.  He  has
       remained here ever since, that is, for a  period  in  excess  of  22
       years. On 9 November 2005, when he was aged 10, he benefitted from a
       grant of indefinite leave to remain but  this  was  revoked  by  the
       later initiation of proceedings to secure his removal.

    3. The appellant has a number of convictions. On 13 April 2007  at  the
       age of 19, he was given a 12 month community order for an offence of
       handling stolen goods. On 29 September  2010  for  possession  of  a
       Class B controlled drug and possession of a Class A controlled  drug
       with intent to supply, he was sentenced to 18 months and  30  months
       imprisonment to run concurrently, (2 ï¿½ years in all).

    4. It was this offence that prompted the Secretary of State to consider
       his deportation. He was released on 27 July 2011 but by 28  February
       2012 he had breached the conditions of his license. In  April  2012,
       by which time he had received notice to the effect that  deportation
       was, in the view of the Secretary of State, in the public  interest,
       he claimed asylum. Notwithstanding the precarious position in  which
       the appellant was faced, he committed two  further  offences  on  17
       August 2012 of false imprisonment  and  inflicting  grievous  bodily
       harm. He was not sentenced for these offences until 21 June 2015  at
       which time he was sentenced to 2  concurrent  terms  of  21  months.
       Since the  conviction  for  these  latter  offences  post-dated  the
       earlier decision by some months, a further decision was made by  the
       Secretary of State on 23 March 2016 referring to the later  sentence
       of imprisonment. In this second decision,  the  Secretary  of  State
       decided that the appellant did not fall within any of the exemptions
       to  deportation  contained  within   paragraphs   399A   and   399B.
       Accordingly, the Secretary  of  State  maintained  her  decision  to
       deport the appellant.


    5. The appellant's subsequent appeal included an asylum claim which was
       dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge along with the associated
       claim for humanitarian protection and that his removal would violate
       his Article 3 rights. Those elements are no  longer  pursued  before
       me. Consequently, the exclusive focus in the appeal  before  me  has
       been the Article 8 claim and the statutory overlay placed upon it by
       the Immigration Rules and Part 5A of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
       and Asylum Act, 2002 as inserted by section 19  of  the  Immigration
       Act 2014 and, in particular, section  117C  as  it  relates  to  the
       deportation of foreign criminals (of whom the appellant is one).

    6. In summary, these  provisions  state  that  deportation  of  foreign
       criminals is in public interest unless one of two exceptions applies
       to them. It thus becomes necessary to set out the provisions of  the
       Immigration Rules and Part 5A of the 2002 Act:


          "398. Where a  person  claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
          contrary to the UK's obligations under  Article  8  of  the  Human
          Rights Convention, and
          (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
          public good and in the public  interest  because  they  have  been
          convicted of an offence for which they have been  sentenced  to  a
          period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;
          (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
          public good and in the public  interest  because  they  have  been
          convicted of an offence for which they have been  sentenced  to  a
          period of imprisonment of less  than  4  years  but  at  least  12
          months; or
          (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
          public good and in the public interest because, in the view of the
          Secretary of State, their offending has  caused  serious  harm  or
          they are a persistent offender who shows  a  particular  disregard
          for the law, the Secretary of State in assessing that  claim  will
          consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies  and,  if  it  does
          not, the public interest in deportation will only be outweighed by
          other factors where there are very compelling  circumstances  over
          and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.
          ...
          399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies
          if -
          (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most  of
          his life; and
          (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and
          (c) there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
          into the country to which it is proposed he is deported."
     Part 5A of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act,  2002  now
provides:
          117A Application of this Part
          (1)  This Part applies where a court or tribunal  is  required  to
          determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
          (a)  breaches a person's right to respect for private  and  family
          life under Article 8, and
          (b)  as a result would be unlawful under section 6  of  the  Human
          Rights Act 1998.
          (2)  In considering the public interest  question,  the  court  or
          tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
          (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed  in  section  117B,
          and
          (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign  criminals,  to
          the considerations listed in section 117C.
          117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable  in  all
          cases
          (1)The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
          public interest.
          ...


          117C  Article  8  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
          foreign criminals.
          (1)  The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
          interest.
          (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
          the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
          (3) In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
          sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or  more,  the
          public interest requires C's deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
          Exception 2 applies.
          (4) Exception 1 applies where-
          (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of
          C's life,
          (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom,
          and
          (c) there would be very significant obstacles to  C's  integration
          into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.
          (5) Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
          relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a   genuine   and
          subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the
          effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be  unduly
          harsh.
          (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
          period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
          requires   deportation   unless   there   are   very    compelling
          circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1  and
          2.
          (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be  taken
          into account where a court or tribunal is considering  a  decision
          to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent  that  the  reason
          for the decision  was  the  offence  or  offences  for  which  the
          criminal has been convicted.


    7. There are three preliminary points that have to be made. First,  the
       appellant has been convicted of  four  offences  for  which  he  has
       received prison sentences in two  separate  appearances  before  the
       Crown Court. In the first he was sentenced to a concurrent period of
       2 ï¿½ years; in the second, a concurrent sentence of 21 months. He was
       therefore been sentenced to periods of  imprisonment  in  excess  of
       four years. The operation of the Rules  and  section  117C  draws  a
       distinction between those who have  been  sentenced  to  between  12
       months and four years and those who have been sentenced to  4  years
       or more.


    8. However, the words of paragraph 398(c) make it plain that the higher
       threshold requiring 'exceptional circumstances'  (or,  indeed,  very
       compelling circumstances)  to  be  established  before  'the  public
       interest in deportation will be outweighed by  other  factors'  does
       not arise if the appellant establishes he meets the  conditions  for
       the  exception  contained  in  paragraph  399A.     Similarly,   the
       swingeing effect of section 117C (6) that  an  appellant  must  show
       "very  compelling  reasons  over  and  above  those   described   in
       Exceptions 1 and 2" is reserved for those who have been sentenced on
       a single occasion to imprisonment of four years or more  ('a  period
       of imprisonment of at least 4 years'). Consequently, the appellant's
       appeal is to be determined by reference to the  provisions  relating
       to  a  foreign  criminal  who  has  been  sentenced  to  12   months
       imprisonment or more but less than four years.


    9. It follows from this that  the  relevant  provisions  are  contained
       within paragraph 399A namely


          (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and
          (c) there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
          into the country to which it is proposed he is deported."


   10. Second, it cannot be overstated  that  the  nature  of  the  present
       appeal before the Upper Tribunal is  not  a  rehearing.   The  Upper
       Tribunal will not remake the decision (or require that it be  remade
       by the First-tier Tribunal) unless an error on a point  of  law  has
       been found rendering it necessary to set aside the determination  of
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Aujla.  In the context of this appeal this
       might include a rationality challenge or it might include a  reasons
       challenge.

   11. Thirdly, the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  Bossade  (ss.117A-D-
       interrelationship with Rules) [2015] UKUT 00415  (IAC)  makes  clear
       that this appellant's Article 8 claim must first  be  considered  by
       reference to the Immigration Rules and then by reference to Part  5A
       if such a consideration arises. The crux of the  appeal  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal was the application  of  paragraph  399A.  As  a
       person who has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most
       of his life this first required the Tribunal to consider whether the
       appellant was socially and culturally  integrated  into  the  United
       Kingdom and then, as the next stage, to determine whether there were
       very significant obstacles in his integration into  the  country  to
       which it is proposed he is deported.

   12. This second stage test was considered by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
       Secretary of State for the Home Department v Kamara [2016] EWCA  Civ
       813 (Moore-Bick and Sales LJJ)  in  which  Sales  LJ  spoke  of  the
       concept of a foreign criminal's 'integration'. He said in  paragraph
       14:

          It is not confined to the mere ability to find a job or to sustain
          life while living in the other country. It is not  appropriate  to
          treat the statutory language as subject to some gloss and it  will
          usually be sufficient for a court or  tribunal  simply  to  direct
          itself in the terms that Parliament has chosen to use. The idea of
          "integration" calls for a broad evaluative judgment be made as  to
          whether the individual will be enough of an insider  in  terms  of
          understanding how life in the society in  that  other  country  is
          carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so as  to  have  a
          reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to operate
          on a day-to-day basis in that society and to  build  up  within  a
          reasonable time a variety of human relationships to give substance
          to the individual's private or family life.

   13. The effect of paragraph 399A is that where the  Tribunal  finds  the
       appellant is integrated into the United Kingdom and very significant
       obstacles exist to be appellant's  integration  in  the  country  of
       nationality, the finding amounts  to  an  exception  to  the  normal
       inference that deportation is conducive to the public  good  and  in
       the public interest. In such a case, the enquiry ends  there.  There
       is then no further requirement to consider  the  proportionality  of
       the appellant's removal because the public good has not  been  found
       sufficient to justify the interference.


   14.  It is against this background that I have to embark upon a critical
       examination of the First-tier Tribunal's determination. Much of  the
       determination was spent on a consideration of the appellant's asylum
       claim. In paragraph 48, the Judge concluded that the  appellant  had
       not established, on the lower standard of proof, that he had a  well
       founded fear of persecution. Accordingly, he dismissed the appeal on
       asylum  grounds  and,  inevitably,  concluded  there  would  be   no
       violation of the appellant's Article 3 rights. So far, the Judge  is
       determination of the appeal is uncontroversial.


   15. The Judge then moved on to consider whether  the  appellant  had  an
       established family private life in the United Kingdom and the effect
       this would have upon the appellant himself but,  more  particularly,
       upon his daughter. The Judge was satisfied that  the  appellant  had
       established both to have family life in the United Kingdom  as  well
       as a private  life  involving  relationships  with  his  mother  and
       siblings.


   16. The Judge then recited that, whilst it would be  desirable  for  the
       appellant's daughter to be brought up by both of  her  parents,  the
       appellant has himself put this in jeopardy by committing  a  serious
       criminal offence. The appellant's wife has no connection to the DRC.
       However, were he to be removed, she would be able to cope  with  the
       situation, as she did whilst he was imprisoned, with the help of her
       own family and  social  services.  The  effect  of  the  appellant's
       deportation would not, therefore, be unduly harsh. In reaching  this
       conclusion he plainly balanced the criminal  offending  against  the
       consequences of his removal thereby properly using 'unduly'  as  the
       critical consideration by which the assessment was to  be  made.  He
       accepted,  reasonably,  that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
       appellant's wife and child to go with him to the  DRC.  Once  again,
       the Judge's determination of the appeal, so far, is uncontroversial.
       He  then  went  on  to  deal  with  the  crucial  consideration   of
       integration both here and potentially in the DRC.

   17.  In paragraph 53 of the determination, he  swiftly  dealt  with  the
       appellant's integration in the United Kingdom.  He said:

          It is correct that the appellant has been lawfully present in  the
          UK most of his life.  I also accept he is socially and  culturally
          integrated in the UJK although he spent about 2 years in total  in
          custody.

   18. The challenge that is made by the Secretary of State in the  grounds
       of appeal to the Upper Tribunal is that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
       approach was manifestly in error. It is said that the Judge gave  no
       reasons  for  his  finding  that  the  appellant  was  socially  and
       culturally integrated in the United Kingdom. Whilst, of course,  the
       appellant has shown that he has misbehaved, that does  not  preclude
       his having become integrated into society within the United Kingdom.
       This criminal offending, including the time that  he  has  spent  in
       prison, speak against his having become integrated but, at the  same
       time, his presence in the United Kingdom since the age of seven, his
       education in the United Kingdom,  the  presence  of  family  members
       within the United Kingdom, his British wife and family  are  factors
       that weigh in favour of a finding that  he  has  become  integrated.
       Indeed, it would be surprising had he not  done  so.  All  of  these
       factors  are  mentioned  by  the  Judge  in  the   course   of   his
       determination.


   19. The appellant prays in aid the decision of  the  European  Court  of
       Human Rights in Maslov v Austria [2008] ECHR  546  which  identifies
       relevant factors in assessing proportionality  but  the  Court  also
       formulated  general  principles  of  protection  when  children  are
       involved who have moved to the host country in early  childhood  and
       have spent most, if not all, of their childhood in the host country,
       who were brought up in it and who received  their  education  there.
       The ECHR went on to say


          In short, the Court considers that for a settled migrant  who  has
          lawfully spent all or the major part of his or her  childhood  and
          youth in the host country very serious  reasons  are  required  to
          justify expulsion.  This is all  the  more  so  where  the  person
          concerned committed the offences underlying expulsion measures  as
          a juvenile.


   20.  Whilst  these  considerations  are  directly  concerned  with   the
       proportionality balance, they are also significant in the assessment
       of  integration  since  proportionality  in  such  circumstances  is
       largely a consideration of whether  an  individual  who  has  become
       integrated into the host country should be required to leave.


   21. For these reasons, I am not satisfied that it was either perverse or
       irrational  for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  conclude  that   the
       appellant was integrated in the United Kingdom, notwithstanding  his
       criminal offending. The facts speak sufficiently clearly  in  favour
       of integration without requiring more detailed reasoning.

   22. Furthermore, the Secretary of State's  argument  on  this  issue  is
       bedevilled by the fact that the decision letter used the wrong  form
       of the relevant version of paragraph 399A and this inevitably  moved
       the focus away  from  the  appellant's  integration  in  the  United
       Kingdom.  Indeed, in the decision letter the consideration  of  this
       aspect is confined to the words


          There is no evidence from your community to indicate that you have
          provided a positive contribution or evidence of employment.


   23. It is  not,  therefore,  surprising  that  upon  this  very  limited
       consideration of the appellant's integration in the  United  Kingdom
       that the First-tier Tribunal Judge did no more than make  a  passing
       reference to it.  It had not been raised in the refusal  letter  and
       there is little to suggest that it was raised as a contentious issue
       in the course  of  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In
       particular, I am not satisfied that it assumed the  prominence  that
       the grounds to the Upper Tribunal now suggest.

   24. The Judge certainly treated the final limb of paragraph 399A as  the
       most contentious, namely, whether there would be very significant is
       obstacles to the appellant's integration into the DRC. In  paragraph
       54 of his determination he recorded the fact that the appellant  has
       resided in the United Kingdom continuously since 1995, then a period
       of 21 years. He was seven years old on  arrival  and  had  obviously
       spent his formative years in the United Kingdom.  He  accepted  that
       the appellant, as a 28-year-old, was fit and well and there  was  no
       reason to assume that he would not be able to take on employment  on
       his return. Clearly referring to the Court of Appeal's  decision  in
       Kamara, the Judge accepted that  the  concept  of  integration  into
       society in a new country was much wider than simply  being  able  to
       take employment. He recited the fact that the appellant had no close
       family or relatives in the DRC. There was no evidence that he  spoke
       French or Lingala, the two main languages  spoken  in  the  DRC.  He
       recorded that the appellant had been  out  of  the  country  for  21
       years, having left the country as a child. Even if his  family  were
       willing and able to provide him some financial  assistance  to  help
       him settle down after his return, the Judge found that  there  would
       be very significant obstacles to the  appellant's  integration  into
       society in the DRC. It is clear from paragraph 55 that  the  Judge's
       consideration was not confined to his reasoning in paragraph 54  but
       was as a result of his consideration of the entirety of the evidence
       presented to him.


   25. Consideration thus moves  to  the  challenge  made  to  the  Judge's
       conclusion  that  there  were  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
       appellant's integration in the DRC. Ms Lovejoy makes the point  that
       the appellant had confirmed in his witness statement that he is  not
       accustomed to the  language  of  the  DRC.  The  respondent  herself
       accepted as plausible that the appellant  is  no  longer  fluent  in
       Lingala or French but suggested that he  could  re-acquaint  himself
       with it. It was, therefore open to the Judge to accept the  evidence
       of the appellant and his witnesses that he did not speak the  common
       languages within the DRC. Ms Lovejoy complains of  the  respondent's
       suggestion that the Judge was required to consider the usefulness of
       English as a lingua franca on return to the DRC. She properly points
       out that this point was not  advanced  in  the  decision  letter  or
       before the First-tier Tribunal Judge. Accordingly, there could be no
       presumption that speaking English  was  a  significant  or  material
       factor in considering integration into the DRC. She points out  that
       the Judge correctly acknowledged the appellant was fit and well  and
       able to work but that this was only one element in the consideration
       of the prospect of integration into the DRC. She submits  that  this
       is a holistic exercise where a general assessment has to be made  in
       relation to the specific circumstances of the appellant  which  must
       include all of the evidence.


   26. In my judgment, the reasons  are  adequate  to  convey  the  Judge's
       thinking.  The crux of  the  decision  was  a  comparison  with  the
       private and family life the appellant had established in the  United
       Kingdom and whether this amounted to his integration  here  and  the
       differences he would  encounter  to  his  integration  in  the  DRC,
       notwithstanding his physical fitness to  find  work.   On  a  proper
       reading of the determination, no reasonable reader could be left  in
       doubt as to why the  Judge  decided  in  favour  of  the  appellant.
       Adopting this as  the  starting-point,  it  is  not  for  the  Upper
       Tribunal  to  reach  its  own  conclusion  on  that   issue   absent
       conclusions that are perverse or irrational.

DECISION


     The Judge made no error on a point of law and the original
         determination of the
                   appeal shall stand.
