                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1.   This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal, with permission,  by  the
         Appellant, a Pakistani national who had  made  an  application  for
         further leave to remain as a  Tier  1  entrepreneur  migrant.  That
         application was refused on 16th May 2014. He appealed to the First-
         tier Tribunal and in a determination promulgated on 10th  September
         2014 Judge Brookfield dismissed the appeal.


    2.   Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by a  Judge
         of the First-tier Tribunal on 23rd October 2014.  Thus  the  matter
         comes before me. My first task is to decide whether the  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge made an error of law and if so whether and  to  what
         extent the decision should be set aside.
    3.   The grounds allege that the Judge made  an  error  in  basing  her
         decision on her erroneous belief that the Respondent had sent three
         e-mails to the Bank Alfalah in Pakistan in an attempt to  verify  a
         letter when in fact only one e-mail had been sent. She erred in her
         finding at paragraph 11 (iii) of  the  determination  that    on  a
         balance of probabilities the Respondent had sent three verification
         request e-mails to the bank and the bank did not respond to any  of
         them. Furthermore the Appellant had produced a letter from the bank
         indicating that no such e-mail had been received.


    4.   The grounds also assert that the judge erred in finding  that  the
         Respondent had had insufficient time to verify the  letter  adduced
         in the bundle.


    5.   On behalf of the Respondent, Mr Harrison asserted that  any  error
         was not material and the simple fact is that  the  letter  was  and
         remains unverified.


    6.   The facts of this case are that the Appellant entered the UK as  a
         student in September 2010. He was then given leave to remain  as  a
         post study worker and it was while he had that leave that  he  made
         the current application as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.  The
         sole reason for the refusal appears to have been the  Secretary  of
         State's inability to verify the document provided by the  Appellant
         from Alfalah Bank Limited which led her to conclude the letter  was
         not genuine.


    7.   The judge set out her findings and reasons in paragraph 11 of  the
         determination and the 7 sub-paragraphs thereof.


    8.   At 11 (i) the Judge noted that  the  Respondent,  in  the  refusal
         indicated the Appellant had provided a  letter  from  Alfalah  Bank
         limited as evidence that he has  access to ï¿½50,000 belonging to  Mr
         Touseef  Haider.  The  Judge  says  in  that  paragraph   that  the
         Respondent e-mailed the bank to verify the letter on 14th April, 29
         April and 12 May 2014 and that no response was received to  any  of
         those e-mails.


    9.   In his grounds of appeal the Appellant pointed out that  his  team
         member, a Mr Zeeshan Umer was reliant on the same funds in the same
         bank account and his appeal was allowed. He suggested  that  e-mail
         is not a reliable form of  communication  as  transmission  can  be
         interrupted or alternatively mail can go straight to  a  junk  box.
         The Appellant asserted that the Respondent  should  have  contacted
         him if she was having difficulties obtaining a  response  from  the
         bank.  The Judge rejected those submissions as she was entitled  to
         do.


    10.  The nub of the Appellant's argument before the Upper  Tribunal  is
         that the Judge was mistaken  about  the  number  of  e-mails  which
         meant that her finding at paragraph 11 (iii) that on the  basis  of
         three unanswered emails and a late produced copy letter that  could
         not be verified, the document remained unverified.
    11.  The Appellant relied on various cases  and  on  the  principle  of
         fairness to support his appeal and argued that paragraph  245AA  of
         the Immigration Rules, which states that  the  Respondent  is  only
         permitted to discount a specified  document  after  she  has  taken
         reasonable steps to verify it, was not met in this case because the
         Secretary of State had not taken sufficient steps.  It  was  argued
         that if the Secretary of State was having difficulty contacting the
         bank she should have contacted the Appellant.  The  Judge  rejected
         that argument noting that paragraph  245AA  does  not  require  the
         Respondent to contact an  Appellant  if  a  bank  fails  to  verify
         documents.


    12.  At paragraph  11(iv)  the  Judge  noted  that  the  Appellant  had
         provided a copy letter from the bank dated 27 August 2014 which was
         in his appeal bundle submitted to the Tribunal  on  1st  September.
         The Judge observed that she had not been provided with the original
         of the letter and also that the Respondent was entitled to be given
         the  opportunity  to  verify  that  document  and  there  had  been
         insufficient time in which to do so. The original was not  provided
         and the hearing was on 2nd September. The  Judge  was  entitled  to
         make that finding.


    13.  At paragraph 11 (v) the Judge noted that the financial sponsor and
         owner of the bank account in question provided an  e-mail  sent  to
         him from the bank indicating that the bank had never received any e-
         mail from the Respondent. The Judge however also observed  that  he
         had not produced any evidence that he had asked the bank to contact
         the Respondent directly; rather he had produced another  unverified
         letter.


    14.  I have looked at the documents provided in the Respondent's bundle
         in particular  the  e-mails.  The  first  document  is  the  letter
         submitted with the original application purporting to be from  Bank
         Alfalah Limited confirming the availability of funds. There is then
         an e-mail sent by Tier 1 Entrepreneur  Verifications  at  the  Home
         office to the High Commission in Islamabad chasing a reply to their
         original request for verification by the bank. In response to  that
         chasing e-mail the High Commission in Islamabad replied on 30th May
         indicating that there had  been  no  response  from  the  bank  and
         therefore the result was inconclusive.  Following  a  request  from
         Tier 1 Entrepreneur Verifications for copies of e-mails sent to the
         bank a response was received that they could only send the last one
         as the previous one had been sent by an officer who had since  left
         and they could not access that person's e-mail  account.  There  is
         therefore only a copy of one e-mail to the  bank  provided  in  the
         Respondent's bundle although there is a clear reference to others.


    15.  It seems clear that the Judge  was  mistaken  as  to  the  precise
         number of e-mails in  the  bundle.  What  seems  to  have  in  fact
         happened is that the Tier 1 Entrepreneur  Verifications  Department
         of the Home Office in the UK had sent more than one e-mail  to  the
         British High Commission in Islamabad asking them to  check.  It  is
         also clear that more than one e-mail was sent to the bank  although
         only one is copied in the bundle. However, while there is only  one
         e-mail in the bundle it is also the case that the same  e-mail  was
         sent to four different people at the bank. It was sent to  two  and
         copied to two others. That is the same as sending four emails. None
         of those four people responded. The mistake by the Judge  was  thus
         wholly irrelevant and immaterial.  She  believed  that  there  were
         three unanswered e-mails whereas in fact there were four.


    16.  It is also the case,  as  noted  by  the  Judge  that  it  is  not
         acceptable to produce a copy of a letter  purporting  to  verify  a
         document  only  very  shortly  before  the  hearing  so  that   the
         Respondent is unable to verify it. Accordingly,  I  find  that  the
         Judge made a mistake of fact and while that mistake impacted on her
         decision it is quite clear that on the basis of the evidence before
         her, no Judge would  have  reached  a  different  conclusion.   The
         simple fact is that the British  High  Commission  did  attempt  to
         contact four different people at the bank to verify a document  and
         none of them responded. The only evidence the Appellant could  come
         up with was a copy of a  document  produced  far  too  late  to  be
         verified. Knowing that that  was  the  criticism  levelled  at  the
         Appellant by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  it was of  course  open
         to the Appellant  and those advising him  after  the  determination
         was promulgated and after permission to appeal had been granted, to
         contact the bank and  ask  it  to  e-mail  the   Respondent  direct
         verifying the documents.  An application could have  been  made  to
         adduce additional evidence before the Upper Tribunal.  None of this
         was  done.  It  would  have  been  a  simple  matter   to   produce
         satisfactory  verification  evidence  if  indeed  the  document  is
         genuine. Failure to do so strongly indicates that it is not. As  Mr
         Harrison pointed out, however many e-mails were in fact  sent,  the
         simple fact of the  matter  is  that  the  document  has  not  been
         verified.


    17.  Accordingly, I find the mistake of  fact  in  this  case  did  not
         amount to a material error of law. Had  the  Judge  not  made  that
         mistake the result would have been the same.


    18.  The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
