For the Appellants:    Mr W. Rees, Counsel instructed by VMD Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A. Brocklesby-Weller,  Senior Home Office
                       Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are all nationals of Bangladesh. They are respectively a
    husband, wife and their son. They appeal with permission  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Oxlade)  to  dismiss  their  linked
    appeals against a decision to refuse to  vary  their  leave  as  Points
    Based System Migrants and to remove them from the United Kingdom.


 2. The principle applicant was in the United Kingdom with leave as a  Tier
    1 (Post Study Work) Migrant when he made an in-time application to vary
    that leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepeneur). His wife and child applied at the
    same time for leave as dependents.

 3. The applications were refused on the 23rd January 2015. The  Respondent
    did not accept that the applicants met the requirements of  the  Rules.
    In particular, they had not met the requirements of paragraph  245DD(h)
    for a failure to demonstrate that:

               . that the applicant had  genuinely  established/taken  over/
                 become Director of one or more businesses  in  the  UK  and
                 continues to operate that business
               . there had been a genuine investment or there was a  genuine
                 intention to invest
               .  the  money  relied  upon  was  genuinely   available   for
                 investment and would remain available until such time as it
                 had been used by the business
               . the applicant did not otherwise intend to take employment


    These were the matters in issue before the Tribunal.


 4. The First-tier Tribunal heard oral evidence from the  first  Appellant.
    It was referred to the written evidence including an interview that had
    been conducted with the the  Appellant  prior  to  the  refusal.    The
    Tribunal's attention was drawn to the list of documents that  had  been
    submitted with the application. The determination lists  the  8  issues
    raised by the refusal letter, and the Appellant's  responses  to  them.
    The Tribunal directed itself that the evidence had to be approached  in
    a "holistic" way.  The  Tribunal  was  not  satisfied  that  the  First
    Appellant had shown his business  or  investment  to  be  genuine.  The
    Appellant told the Judge that his preparatory work had started 2  years
    ago but there was no evidence of anything committed to  paper.  He  had
    not supported his application with any  evidence  of  market  research;
    although this was not obligatory it was pointed out on the form that it
    would be of assistance to the decision maker. Bearing in mind the claim
    that the Appellant and his  business  partner  were  purporting  to  be
    investing ï¿½50,000 this was surprising:


         "There is criticism made that the Appellants  tried  to  submit  it
         later at interview,  but  the  Respondent  refused  to  accept  it;
         however they were advised  by  Solicitors  at  the  time  of  their
         application, and it was well-known by then that there  were  strict
         rules about the date of submission with PBS applicants. I find that
         the absence of submission at that stage was because none  had  been
         conducted; it was telling that nowhere did the First Appellant  set
         out the facts and figures on which they based their assessment"



    As to the evidence that the Appellant and his partner intended to start
    in the Bangladeshi community and  then  grow  from  there  to  reach  a
    "global market" within  24  months,  the  Tribunal  noted  a  "mismatch
    between  published  aspiration  and  the  reality"  and  dismissed  the
    appeals.


    The Challenge


 5. The grounds (which are longer and more detailed than the  determination
    itself) are not easy to read and  do  not  clearly  identify  what  the
    alleged errors of law are. Insofar as I have  been  able  to  summarise
    them it is alleged that the First-tier Tribunal erred in the  following
    material respects:


    a) Failing to take material  evidence  into  account/  misunderstanding
       evidence that was given.


       The Appellant had said that his ability to work on the business  had
       been hampered by his lack of security about his immigration  status.
       The Judge had accepted this but had  then  questioned  why,  if  the
       Appellant was concerned about that insecurity, had  taken  a  three-
       year lease on a premises. The Judge failed to take into account  the
       fact that there was a break clause in the lease which meant that the
       premises could be given up on two months notice at any point.


       The Tribunal gave weight to the fact that there were differences  in
       the figures  and information given by the Appellant and his  partner
       when they were interviewed. The Tribunal  failed  to  give  adequate
       weight to the fact that they had been interviewed at different times
       so the information would obviously be different because the business
       was at a different stage.


       The Tribunal had placed weight on an  apparent  discrepancy  between
       the Appellant's evidence that he provided  additional  services  for
       some clients upon oral agreement, and  the  face  of  the  contracts
       which stated that any variation in agreement would need  to  be  set
       down in writing. The Tribunal failed to give adequate weight to  the
       Appellant's explanation that these were not variations  in  contract
       but separate services.


       The Appellant had given evidence that one of  the  services  he  was
       offering to clients in  the  restaurant  trade  was  for  an  online
       ordering service. This evidence was not taken into account at all.


       The Tribunal weighed against the Appellant has failure  to  directly
       answer a question put to him about whether his contract  with  Tesco
       contained an anti-competition clause. The Tribunal  failed  to  take
       into account the fact that the  Appellant  had  not  understood  the
       question and that when it had been clarified in  re-examination  had
       answered it.


       The Tribunal had weighed against the Appellant the fact that much of
       the information he purported to provide his clients with was readily
       available on the internet. The Judge failed to take into account the
       submission that some companies would not be able  to  conduct  their
       own research in this way. These were services  that  were  typically
       provided by a business consultancy.



    b) The Judge took a strict approach to the requirement  for  supporting
       documents.

       The Immigration Rules in force at the date of the decision  had  not
       contained any requirement  as  to  specified  evidence  relating  to
       market research.


       The Tribunal found that there was no evidence that the Appellant had
       conducted any preparation prior to establishing his  business.  This
       was not correct: at a bare minimum he had his business plan.


       The Tribunal further fails to  consider  that  much  of  the  market
       research had been conducted whilst the Appellant was undertaking his
       employment as a store manager for Tesco, and could not therefore  be
       documented.


    c) The refusal had been contrary to the principles of fairness.

       At paragraph 31 of the determination the Tribunal weighs against the
       Appellant  his  failure  to  provide  certain  documentary  evidence
       (relating to market research) prior to the refusal. His evidence had
       been that he had  offered  to  submit  such  evidence  when  he  was
       interviewed, and the interviewing officer had declined, assuring him
       that he would be contacted if it was necessary. It was therefore not
       fair for this matter to be weighed against  him.  The  determination
       has not addressed that explanation.


    d) The Tribunal erred in questioning the Appellant's business plan


       The Appellant had explained that he intended to start  his  business
       within the Bangladeshi community and grow it from there.  The  Judge
       had erred in not accepting this as viable.


 6. In his oral submissions Mr Rees concentrated on (c). He submitted  that
    the Tribunal appeared to have placed considerable weight on the absence
    of  marketing  materials  in  the  application  and  that   given   the
    Appellant's evidence about what had transpired at the  interview,  this
    was  contrary  to  common  law  principles  of  fairness.    He  had  a
    legitimate expectation that he would be contacted if  necessary.   When
    pressed to set out what the Appellant would  have  submitted,  had  the
    interviewing officer got back to him, Mr Rees said that he  would  have
    supplied  "hard  evidence  of  business  progression".  There  was   no
    evidential foundation for the finding  that  the  business  plan  -  to
    expand from the Bangladeshi community -  was  not  credible.  This  was
    their target group and it did need help using the internet.  The  Judge
    "cherry picked" the evidence in order to reach an adverse conclusion.


 7. For the Respondent Ms Brocklesby-Weller took issue with the Appellant's
    description of events at his interview. The interview record  does  not
    support his claim that he  tried  to  submit  documents  and  that  the
    officer declined to take  them,  or  that  he  was  told  he  would  be
    contacted if they needed any further information.   The Tribunal made a
    global appraisal of the evidence which is what  it  was  meant  to  do.
    Unlike in many PBS appeals it was  not  simply  a  'tick-box'  exercise
    because  the  overall  question   was   whether   the   Appellant   had
    demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that he was a genuine Tier
    1 Entrepeneur.


    My Findings

 8. It will be observed from the foregoing that the vast  majority  of  the
    closely argued grounds of appeal are no more  than  disagreements  with
    the decision of the Judge. The grounds frame  these  challenges  as  "a
    failure to take material evidence into  account"  but  in  fact  it  is
    apparent that the Appellant's explanations  were  considered,  and  not
    accepted.  The  Tribunal's  findings  were  all  within  the  range  of
    reasonable  responses.  The  Appellant  had  submitted  that   apparent
    discrepancies as to the nature of the contracts had arisen because  the
    Appellant had reached ad hoc oral agreements  with  his  clients;   the
    Tribunal was entitled to reject that evidence as it did  on  the  basis
    that the contracts themselves stipulated that any changes  were  to  be
    done in writing.  The point about the lease does not reveal any flaw in
    the reasoning. In order to explain why so little  had  apparently  been
    done  in  pursuit  of  this  business  the  Appellant  had  blamed  the
    uncertainty arising from his lack of immigration status - the  Tribunal
    was quite right to query why he had then signed  up  to  a  three  year
    lease agreement on a business property, regardless of the terms of  the
    break clause.   Overall I am satisfied that the Tribunal  paid  careful
    attention to the evidence placed before it.


 9. The central ground, as framed by Mr Rees, is the fairness point.  I  am
    satisfied that this ground is not made out.  First  of  all,  there  is
    absolutely no support on the face of the  record  for  the  Appellant's
    claim about what happened at interview. In order for there to have been
    a legitimate expectation there would need to  be  a  clear  unambiguous
    indication. There isn't.  Secondly, I am satisfied that the point  made
    at paragraph 31 of the determination is a good one.   If these business
    partners were genuinely  intending  to  start  a  business  and  invest
    ï¿½50,000 in it, one would  expect  there  to  be  extensive  documentary
    evidence of research and business development over a substantial period
    and for this to have been submitted with the application, regardless of
    whether the documents in question were 'specified' mandatory  evidence.
    It might also be said that it was not at all clear  what  evidence  the
    Appellant could have supplied that  would  have  allayed  the  decision
    maker's (or indeed Tribunal's) concerns about the  overall  credibility
    about this application.


10. The Respondent had given numerous reasons as to why the  Appellant  had
    not discharged the burden of proof. The determination sets these out in
    detail at paragraph 7 and the Appellant's responses at 10. It is  clear
    from the findings that the Tribunal is not satisfied that the  concerns
    have been adequately addressed.  The company had only been incorporated
    very shortly before the Appellant's last grant  of  leave  expired  and
    there was no evidence that they had been developing  the  idea  in  the
    months preceding that. The  only  evidence  of  business  activity  was
    limited and recent.   There had been fundamental contradictions in  the
    evidence  given  by  the  Appellant  and  his  business  partner   when
    interviewed which could not rationally be explained by  the  fact  that
    the interviews took place at different times. The  Appellant's  partner
    told the decision-maker that their contracts had been signed in  August
    and November 2014 when the Appellant had submitted evidence  that  they
    had been signed in July.  As there had only been two contracts  signed,
    it  was  reasonable  to  assume  that  both  directors  would  have  an
    understanding of them.  Checks had been run  on  one  of  these  client
    companies and the Respondent had doubts about whether it in  fact  even
    existed. The business plans were generic and the  Tribunal  was  in  my
    view perfectly entitled to draw adverse  conclusions  from  their  wild
    aspirations. The idea that a business could start by giving  HR  advice
    to two small companies in Whitechapel (the nature of which was unclear)
    and from there expand to a "global market" in 24 months could  properly
    be described as not credible.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal undertook a holistic appraisal of the evidence and made  clear
    findings of fact. I am satisfied that the Tribunal  took  into  account
    the evidence of the Appellant and the submissions made on his behalf.

11. The decision contains no error of law and is upheld.
