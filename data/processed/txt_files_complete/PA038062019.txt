For the Appellant:     Ms K Bassi, Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms E Griffiths, Counsel instructed by Turpin &
                    Miller LLP (Oxford)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

I make an order for anonymity pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 prohibiting disclosure of any  matter  that  may
lead to the identification of the respondent  and  other  parties  to  these
proceedings.  Any breach may lead to contempt proceedings.

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission the decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Juss, who for reasons given in his  decision  dated
    17 October 2019,  allowed  the  respondent's  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds  against  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  refusing   his
    protection and human rights claims.

 2. The respondent is a citizen of Egypt where he was  born  in  2001.   He
    claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom clandestinely  in  January
    2015.

 3. The judge explained the respondent's claim as follows, in  [4]  of  his
    decision:

         "4.  The essence of the appellants claim is that he lived with  his
             parents and siblings.  His father was a  farmer.   His  mother
             was a housewife.  His father became sick and passed away.  His
             mother then made him leave  Egypt  and  paid  for  someone  to
             arrange the journey.   Neither  he  nor  his  family  had  any
             specific problems in Egypt.  He left because  of  the  general
             situation whereby 'people were dying  and  you  wanted  to  be
             safe' (RL at �17)"

 4. The respondent gave evidence before the judge.  The Secretary of  State
    was not represented.  Evidence was also given by a social worker.

 5. The judge considered that there were two issues  to  be  decided.   The
    first related to the respondent's asylum claim but concluded  that  the
    evidence did not demonstrate that he would be at risk  of  persecution.
    The second related to the human rights aspect of the  claim  which  the
    judge explained at [20] as follows:

         "20. The second issue in  this  appeal,  however,  is  whether  the
             Appellant can succeed on human rights grounds.  His background
             is that, 'I left when I was  11'  (see  his  Rebuttal  Witness
             Statement at �1).  He has no extended family left  (�2).   His
             mental health, as confirmed by the Expert, has suffered hugely
             'from the loss of my family' (�5).   The  effect  of  removing
             him, he claims, would be damaging to his mental  health  (�7).
             Since he left Egypt aged 11 years he has not been back in  the
             7-years since (�8).  In his Witness Statement, dated 4th April
             2019 (at p.6) he states that his Uncle, Hamid was  in  contact
             with him when he first arrived here but he is now dead  (�20).
             He has a brother, Hani, in Germany with whom he is in  contact
             (�5).  However, whereas the Appellant's own narrative  is  the
             starting point it is not the end point.  I  have  to  consider
             what the Experts say as well.

 6. The judge referred to the case of M-W (A Child) Re [2010] EWCA Civ  12,
    at [21] as follows:

         "This is because in M-W (A Child), Re [2010] EWCA Civ  12  Wall  LJ
             explained (at para 39) that:

             "I regard the following as trite propositions of law:

             (1)  Experts do not decide cases.  Judges  do.   The  expert's
                  function is to advise the judge;

             (2)  The judge is fully entitled to accept  or  reject  expert
                  opinion;

             (3)  If the judge decides to reject an expert's advice, he  or
                  she (a) must have a sound basis upon which to  do  so  and
                  (b) must explain why the advice is being rejected.

             (4)  Similar considerations arise when  a  judge  prefers  one
                  expert's evidence to that of another.  Judges must explain
                  why they prefer the evidence of A to that of B."

 7. After referring to M-W (A Child) Re  [2010]  EWCA  Civ  12,  the  judge
    explained at [22]:

         "22. Accordingly, if I decide to reject an expert's  advice  I  (a)
             must have a sound basis upon which to do so; and  I  (b)  must
             explain why the advice is being rejected.  I  have  considered
             this Advice in the Expert's Reports and I cannot conclude that
             it can be rejected.  The Appellant has by all accounts  had  a
             very tumultuous upbringing during which he has seen  the  loss
             of his parents.  He has an uncle but his evidence is  that  he
             has in the past 7-years, since he arrived in  the  UK,  passed
             away.  The Appellant has not had any  stability  in  his  life
             apart from what he has attained now in the UK.   The  evidence
             before me shows that any risk of disruption to that  stability
             will have dire consequences for  the  Appellant's  well-being.
             This is for the following reasons."

 8. Thereafter the judge referred to reports by  Helena  Cullen  of  Asylum
    Welcome and Emma-Penny-Larter, the latter having given evidence  before
    him.  Additionally, he referred to a psychiatric report  by  Dr  Robert
    Cornish.  Helena Cullen had observed the respondent suffered  untreated
    complex post-traumatic stress disorder and multiple unresolved  griefs.
    Ms Penny-Larter had observed that Social Services  had  identified  the
    respondent as a young person in need of extra support and that  he  had
    made very close friendships, bonds and social networks  in  the  United
    Kingdom, so having to leave could make him feel  lonely  and  isolated.
    Dr Cornish referred to the respondent's asthma and use of cannabis  and
    concluded that he should  be  offered  on-going  treatment  as  to  the
    latter.  Dr Cornish also diagnosed the respondent as having significant
    mental health difficulties. Evidence before the judge also  included  a
    report by the respondent's treating psychologist Sushila Dhall, who  is
    a psycho-therapist.

 9. Although accepting it was arguable there was no reason why such support
    should not be available on return to Egypt the judge explained at [25]:

         "25. ... Whereas it is arguable that there is no  reason  why  such
             support should not be available to him upon return  to  Egypt,
             the fact is that  he  has  no  one  there  now  and  he  is  a
             vulnerable individual.  In fact, I find to be decisive in this
             regard the Psychiatric Report by Dr Robert Cornish (pp 10-26).
              This is quite clear that the Appellant  'suffers  from  post-
             traumatic stress disorder', and  'should  be  offered  ongoing
             treatment in support' and that 'his mental health is likely to
             be negatively impacted by a return to Egypt ...' (at  pp.  25-
             26).  On this view he cannot reasonably be returned to Egypt."

10. At [26] and [27] he went on to explain:

         "26. The Appellant accordingly succeeds on Article 8 grounds.   The
             protection of these rights is  principally  now  contained  in
             Para 276ADE of  HC  395  (as  amended).   The  relevant  rules
             require that a claimant has spent 20-years in  the  UK.   This
             not the case with this Appellant.  Accordingly, the Rules  are
             not met.  However,  there  is  an  alternative  basis  to  the
             application of Para 276ADE  which  is  that  there  are  "very
             significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into  the
             country to which he would have  to  go."   In  this  case  the
             Appellant speaks the  relevant  language  of  his  country  of
             origin and has  continuing  family  connections  and  contacts
             there.  There is nothing to suggest that he has lost all  ties
             there.  I do not accept that he has lost  all  contact  as  he
             claims, not least given that with  all  the  modern  means  of
             communications and the internet it is quite inconceivable that
             he would lose contact.

         27.  I direct myself however on the basis of  the  CA  decision  in
             Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813, where it was  explained  that  the
             concept of 'integration' is one which "is a broad one" because
             "it is not confined to mere ability to find a job  or  sustain
             life while living in the other country."   Instead,  the  term
             'integration' is one  which  "calls  for  a  broad  evaluative
             judgment to be made as  to  whether  the  individual  will  be
             enough of an insider in terms of understanding how life in the
             society in that other country is carried on and a capacity  to
             participate in it, so as to have reasonable opportunity to  be
             accepted there" (para  14).   I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
             Appellant given what the expert opinion about him states,  has
             'a capacity to participate  in  it'  when  one  considers  his
             return to Egypt and the traumatic childhood that he  has  had.
             The Expert evidence shows that life in  the  UK  is  the  only
             stability that the Appellant has known and that he 'is a young
             man at high risk of a  complete  and  catastrophic  breakdown'
             because 'he suffers untreated  complex  Post-traumatic  Stress
             Disorder and multiple unresolved griefs.'"

    Accordingly, the judge concluded the respondent succeeded on Article  8
    grounds.

11. In [28] he explained:

         "28. If one were to consider additionally, the position outside the
             immigration rules, it is  plain  that  on  the  basis  of  the
             decision in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 1 there will be 'unjustifiably
             harsh consequences' to the Appellant, for the reasons  I  have
             already identified above, if he were to [be] returned to Egypt
             now."

12. The ground of challenge contends that the judge had erred by  reference
    to procedural  irregularity  and  inadequate  reasoning.   It  is  also
    contended the judge had not made any assessment of the  material  issue
    as to the feasibility of return in respect to the Article 8 claim.   It
    is argued that the decision is insufficiently reasoned and without  the
    requisite anxious scrutiny.  It is also argued that it would have  been
    entirely prudent and reasonable to adjourn  the  hearing  so  that  the
    Secretary of State could challenge the reports  in  evidence,  and  the
    failure to adjourn had resulted in a decision which was  not  based  on
    the consideration of all the relevant evidence in  the  round  and  was
    procedurally unfair.  That failure was against the public  interest  to
    ensure fairness in proceedings.

13. The grounds continue with the  assertion  that  the  judge  had  simply
    accepted the respondent's claim that his parents  and  uncle  had  died
    without evidence or further scrutiny.   The  Article  8  reasoning  was
    flawed as being insufficiently reasoned and did not justify either  the
    exceptionality or proportionality  factors.   It  was  clear  that  the
    respondent had been sent to the United  Kingdom  for  economic  benefit
    rather than any genuine risk, harm of destitution in Egypt.

14. A detailed response  pursuant  to  rule  24  has  been  lodged  by  the
    respondent's representatives.  It is contended that the ground based on
    procedural unfairness, being the failure  to  adjourn,  had  no  merit.
    There was no suggestion that the Secretary of State was  not  aware  of
    the hearing or that he had made any application to adjourn it.  He  was
    not therefore deprived of an opportunity to cross-examine or  challenge
    the evidence.

15. As to the challenge based on the weight given to the  experts'  reports
    the response argues that the  judge  was  entitled  to  treat  them  as
    unchallenged and cannot be criticised for making his findings.  In  any
    event it is contended that the substance of the complaints are not made
    out.  The experts' qualifications to give their opinions were each  set
    out in each of their respective reports and letters and  they  complied
    with the Senior President's Practice Direction 10.  Dr Cornish had  not
    exceeded his remit.  The suggestion by the Secretary of State that  the
    Tribunal should have carried out a  general  search  via  the  internet
    before reaching  its  decision  would  itself  have  been  procedurally
    irregular.  There was no evidential foundation for  the  allegation  of
    bias by the experts or professionals.

16. As to the acceptance of the respondent's evidence, it  is  argued  that
    the appropriate forum for challenging that evidence was the  First-tier
    Tribunal which the Secretary of State had not attended.  It was open to
    the judge to accept the respondent's claim as regards his  parents  and
    uncle's death.  As to the  assertion  of  insufficient  reasons  it  is
    submitted that the findings are clear and  that  the  grounds  in  this
    respect amount to no more than a disagreement and were a clear  attempt
    to argue the case.   Having  allowed  the  appeal  in  accordance  with
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi), the Rules reflected  the  position  where  the
    Secretary of State considered the proportionality balance lay.

17. Finally, it is contended in the response, that the  judge  was  in  any
    event wrong to find that the respondent had family with whom he was  in
    contact in Egypt.  Permission to argue this  was  not  sought  and  was
    unnecessary in accordance with the overriding objective as it conferred
    no material benefit for the respondent in the light of the  outcome  in
    the appeal.

18. At the outset of the hearing before me today, Ms Bassi  clarified  that
    the Secretary of State did not rely on the ground of challenge based on
    a failure by the judge to adjourn the hearing.   She confirmed that the
    scope of the challenge, being that the evidence  did  not  support  the
    conclusions reached, Ms Bassi clarified that the challenge  was  not  a
    perversity one.  As a consequence, the enquiry  before  me  is  to  see
    whether there was evidential support for the findings reached.

19. I am grateful to Ms Bassi and Ms Griffiths for their assistance  in  my
    examination of the range  of  evidence  in  this  case,  including  the
    medical evidence and the sources of material on which in particular  Dr
    Cornish and Ms Dhall relied.

20. I have considered carefully the submissions from both parties as to the
    correctness of the judge's approach to family  ties  and  contact.   It
    appears to be accepted that the respondent has two surviving sisters in
    Egypt.  There was no evidence before the judge of the respondent  being
    in contact with those sisters.   The  judge  did  not  decide  that  by
    reference to any evidence of contact but reached his  conclusion  based
    on reference to in effect social media, and that it  was  inconceivable
    contact would be lost.

21. In my judgment the focus needs to be on [27] of the judge's decision as
    it is here that he reaches the conclusion which led to the  outcome  of
    this appeal.  In explaining that he was not satisfied by reference to a
    citation from Kamara the respondent had capacity to participate in life
    in Egypt if returned.  There  is  no  suggestion  that  the  judge  had
    misunderstood the evidence of Dr Cornish and Ms Dhall who explained  in
    considerable detail the  bleak  prospects  and  difficulties  that  the
    respondent would face on  return.   I  am  not  persuaded  that  either
    exceeded their remit as it was reasonable for them to infer from  their
    views  on  the  respondent's  mental  health  the   difficulties   they
    apprehended he would face and the obstacles that would be caused by his
    behavioural and mental  health  difficulties.   The  reasoning  by  the
    judge, it has to be said, is brief, and the detail in the reports of Dr
    Cornish  and  Ms  Dhall  might   have   been   given   more   coverage.
    Nevertheless, it is unarguable that having regard to the  diagnosis  by
    Dr Cornish that the respondent has real difficulties which  would  pose
    obstacles on his reintegration into Egypt which he left at a young age,
    at the outset of his teenage years.

22. Whilst it may be that had  the  Secretary  of  State  been  represented
    before the judge a different conclusion might have been urged or on the
    same  material  another  judge  might  reach  a  different  conclusion.
    Nevertheless, I am not satisfied there was not evidential  support  for
    the conclusion reached by the judge  as  to  the  potentiality  of  the
    respondent's reintegration into life in Egypt.   The  judge  understood
    the evidence and that included the presence in Egypt of family members.
     The brevity of the judge's reasoning in the circumstances of this case
    does not persuade me that that is an error.  I am  persuaded  that  the
    judge did not err in his decision in allowing this appeal by  reference
    to paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi), and for these reasons this  appeal  by  the
    Secretary of State is dismissed.



NOTICE OF DECISION

The appeal by the Secretary of State is dismissed.
