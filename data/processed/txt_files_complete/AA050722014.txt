                            DECISION AND REASONS

                NOTICE OF APPELLANT'S WITHDRAWAL OF HER CASE


 1. At the hearing before me Ms Pettersen sought to  withdraw  all  of  the
    grounds of challenge set out in the  grounds  of  the  application  for
    permission to appeal on the basis that the challenges set  out  therein
    were not sustainable.

 2. Ms Easty indicated that she did not object to the withdrawal.

 3. The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 as in  force  on  20
    October 2014 and following, set out at Rule 17 that a party may  orally
    withdraw at the hearing but that notice of  withdrawal  will  not  take
    effect unless the Upper Tribunal consents,  save  in  relation  to  the
    withdrawal of an application for permission to appeal.

 4. In light of the circumstances above I consented to the withdrawal.

 5. Following the withdrawal of the appellant's case the  determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appellant's appeal stands.
