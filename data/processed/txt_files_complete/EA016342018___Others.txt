Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting
For the Respondents:   Unrepresented


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. By her decision promulgated on 12 July  2019,  a  copy  of  which  is
       attached, Upper Tribunal Judge Coker set aside the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal. We now remake that decision.

    2. We will refer to the respondents as "the  claimants".  The  claimants
       were not legally represented but Mr Miguel [P] addressed the Tribunal
       on their behalf.

    3. Mr [P] is the biological father of the first  claimant  (born  on  29
       October 2002) and the second claimant (born on 6 October 2010). Until
       recently, he had believed he was the biological father of  the  third
       claimant. However, DNA evidence obtained during these proceedings (in
       May 2018) showed that he is not the biological father  of  the  third
       claimant.

    4. The claimants applied for an EEA family permit to join  their  father
       in the UK, who at the time  of  the  application  was  in  a  durable
       relationship  with,  but  not  married  to,  a   Portuguese   citizen
       exercising Treaty rights in the UK (Ms [S]).

    5. On 11 September 2019 Mr [P] and Ms [S] married. The original marriage
       certificate was provided to us at the hearing.

    6. Mr Melvin accepted that if we found that the  marriage  was  genuine,
       the appeal fell to be allowed in respect  of  the  first  and  second
       claimants as they would be family members of Ms [S] under  regulation
       7(1)(b)(i) and therefore entitled to a family permit under regulation
       12 of the 2016 Regulations. He accepted that the respondent  did  not
       consider the marriage to be a 'sham' marriage and he did  not  submit
       that the marriage was not genuine. We are satisfied that the evidence
       before us, in the form of an original marriage certificate  from  the
       registration district  of  Southwark  dated  11  September  2019,  is
       sufficient to establish that, on the balance of probabilities, Mr [P]
       and Ms [S] are married. We therefore allow the appeals of  the  first
       and second claimants.

    7. Mr Melvin submitted that the third claimant is not  a  family  member
       within  regulation  7  and  therefore  that  his  appeal  should   be
       dismissed, even if the marriage is genuine.

    8. We take the view that the issue of whether the third claimant  should
       be  treated  as  a  family  member  under   regulation   7   is   not
       straightforward and asked Mr Melvin to address  us  on  this,  having
       regard to SM (Algeria) v Entry Clearance  Officer,  UK  Visa  Section
       [2018] UKSC 9. Mr Melvin proposed,  and  we  agreed,  that  he  would
       provide written submissions within 7 days, the claimant's father then
       to have 7 days to respond if so advised. Thereafter we shall  take  a
       decision on the evidence before us.



Notice of Decision and Directions

    9. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  set  aside  by  Upper
       Tribunal Judge Coker on 12 July 2019.

   10. We remake the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  by  allowing  the
       appeals of the  first  and  second  claimants  -  EA/01634/20218  and
       EA/01635/2018.



    Directions regarding EA/01636/2018

        a. The Secretary of State shall serve on  Mr  [P],  the  claimant's
           father, and file with the  Upper  Tribunal  written  submissions
           within 7 days of this decision being sent.

        b. Mr [P], the claimant's father, shall serve on the  Secretary  of
           State and file with the Upper Tribunal his response (if any)  to
           the submissions of the Secretary of State.

        c.  Thereafter  the  Tribunal   will   remake   the   decision   in
           EA/01636/2018 on the evidence before it.
