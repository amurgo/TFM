                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The  Appellants  are  citizens  of  Pakistan.   The  first  and  second
    Appellants are the parents  of  the  third  Appellant.   They  appealed
    against a decision of  Judge  Ennals  (the  judge)  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 19th March 2018.


 2. The Appellants wished to enter  the  UK  and  applied  for  EEA  family
    permits contending that they were  entitled  to  such  permits  as  the
    dependent family members of an EEA national exercising treaty rights in
    the UK.  The EEA national is Dorota Mareviciute  who  is  a  Lithuanian
    citizen and who is married to Muhammad Ejaz Anwar who is the son of the
    first and second Appellants and brother of the third Appellant.


 3. The Appellants were born in January 1954, February  1959,  and  January
    2001 respectively.  Their applications for family permits were  refused
    on 5th October 2016 and the Appellants  appealed  to  the  FtT.   Their
    appeals were dismissed.  The judge accepted that the EEA  national,  to
    whom I shall refer as the Sponsor, was exercising treaty rights in  the
    UK and was a qualified person as defined by regulation  6  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.  The judge accepted that the Appellants and  Sponsor  were
    related as claimed.  The judge  also  accepted  that  the  Sponsor  had
    provided five receipts for money transfers to the  Appellants  starting
    in March 2016.  The judge accepted  that  funds  had  been  sent  on  a
    monthly basis from 19th March 2016 up to the date of hearing.


 4. The judge accepted that the Sponsor had been making regular payments to
    the Appellants since March 2016 but was not persuaded by  the  evidence
    that this was the Appellants' only source of  income  or  support,  and
    therefore was not satisfied that the Appellants are dependent upon  the
    Sponsor.


 5. The Appellants were granted permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
    by Judge Scott-Baker of the FtT.


Error of Law


 6. On 4th September 2018 I heard  submissions  from  both  parties  as  to
    whether or not the FtT had materially erred in law.  It  was  contended
    by the Respondent that there was no material error.   Full  details  of
    the application for permission to appeal, the grant of permission,  and
    the submissions made by both parties are contained in my error  of  law
    decision dated 6th September 2018 and  promulgated  on  14th  September
    2018.


 7. I set out below paragraphs 14-21  of  my  decision,  which  contain  my
    reasons for concluding that the FtT materially erred in law;


         "14.     I am persuaded that the judge materially erred in law  for
             the following reasons.


         15.  With reference to the submission that the  judge  imposed  too
             high a test when considering dependency, I find that it is not
             clear what test was considered by the judge  when  considering
             dependency.  Mr Ahmad referred to Jia [2007] 7 ECR 545 and  SM
             (India) [2009] EWCA Civ 1426.  I find there is a  more  recent
             authority, that being Lim [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 in which  Elias
             LJ stated at paragraph 32 when considering dependency;


                  'In my judgment, the  critical  question  is  whether  the
                  claimant is in fact in a position to  support  himself  or
                  not, and Reyes now makes that clear beyond  doubt,  in  my
                  view.  That is a simple matter of fact.  If he can support
                  himself, there is no  dependency,  even  if  he  is  given
                  financial material  support  by  the  EU  citizen.   Those
                  additional resources are not necessary to  enable  him  to
                  meet his basic needs.  If, on the other  hand,  he  cannot
                  support himself from his own resources, the court will not
                  ask why that is the case, save perhaps where there  is  an
                  abuse of rights'.


         16.  The evidence in this appeal was that the first  Appellant  had
             ceased employment in 2014 and thereafter had no income and  no
             pension.  His wife and child had no income.  They  lived  rent
             free with the first Appellant's brother.


         17.  The judge accepted that the Sponsor had been sending funds  to
             the Appellants since  March  2016.   The  judge  errs  by  not
             providing adequate reasons to explain why this does not amount
             to dependency.  This is linked to the point  that  it  is  not
             clear what test the judge applied when considering dependency.


         18.  It is not clear from reading  the  decision  what  facts  were
             found by the judge.  At paragraph 14 the judge  sets  out  the
             account given, but does not  make  it  clear  what  facts  are
             accepted.


         19.  For the above reasons the decision is unsafe and must  be  set
             aside.  I do not find it is necessary  to  remit  this  appeal
             back to the FtT, having considered paragraph 7 of  the  Senior
             President's Practice Statements.


         20.  It was submitted at the error of law hearing that there  would
             need to be further evidence in relation to  dependency  and  I
             accept that.  This can be considered by  the  Upper  Tribunal.
             There will therefore be a hearing before the Upper Tribunal to
             consider dependency.  The finding by the FtT that the  Sponsor
             has  been  sending  funds  since  March  2016  has  not   been
             challenged  and  is  therefore  preserved.   The  relationship
             between the Sponsor and Appellants has not been challenged and
             the conclusions on that issue are preserved.   Also  preserved
             is the finding that the Sponsor is a qualified person.


         21.  The judge makes reference to the EEA Regulations 2016, but  it
             would appear to be the case that the relevant regulations  are
             the 2006 Regulations".


Re-making the Decision - the Upper Tribunal Hearing 10th December 2018


 8.  At  the  commencement  of  the  hearing  Mr  Ahmed  submitted  further
    documentary  evidence  which  he  had  received  from  his  instructing
    solicitors.  This evidence was served in breach of directions that  any
    further documentary evidence should be served no  later  than  fourteen
    clear calendar days before the hearing, and  was  neither  indexed  nor
    paginated.  However,  Mr  Bates  did  not  object  to  the  documentary
    evidence being submitted in evidence, and did not need further time  to
    consider it.  I therefore decided that it was appropriate to admit  the
    documents into evidence.


 9. The documents submitted at the hearing contain an  affidavit  from  the
    second Appellant, an affidavit from the head of the  village  in  which
    the Appellants live in Pakistan, a schedule from Ria Financial Services
    Ltd detailing funds sent by the Sponsor  to  the  Appellants,  together
    with some further documents showing the transfer of funds.


10. The representatives confirmed that the issue to be decided was  whether
    the Appellants were dependent upon the Sponsor and both representatives
    were ready to proceed and there was no application for an  adjournment.




11. I established that I had received all documentation to be relied  upon.
    In addition to the documents  submitted  at  the  commencement  of  the
    hearing, I had the Respondent's bundle that had been  before  the  FtT,
    and the Appellants' bundle which had been before the FtT comprising  67
    pages.


12. Oral evidence was given by Muhammad Anwar who adopted as  his  evidence
    his witness statement dated 6th March  2018.   His  statement  confirms
    that he is a citizen of Pakistan and that he entered  into  an  Islamic
    marriage with the Sponsor in July 2014.  Their marriage was  registered
    at Manchester Registry Office on 11th March 2016.  Mr  Anwar  holds  an
    EEA residence card as the spouse of an EEA national  exercising  treaty
    rights in the UK.  He lived with the Appellants in  Pakistan  until  he
    came to the UK in 2011 as a student.


13. He confirmed  that  the  first  Appellant,  his  father,  had  been  in
    employment until January 2014 but has not worked thereafter,  and  does
    not have any income other than what is sent  from  the  UK.   Mr  Anwar
    confirmed that he and the Sponsor have been  sending  and  continue  to
    send funds to the Appellants, who have no other form of income.


14. Mr Anwar gave his evidence with the assistance  of  an  interpreter  in
    Urdu, and there were no difficulties in communication.


15. Oral evidence was also given by the Sponsor with the assistance  of  an
    interpreter   in   Lithuanian.    There   were   no   difficulties   in
    communication.  The Sponsor adopted her  witness  statement  dated  6th
    March 2018.  She confirmed her relationship with Mr Anwar and that they
    have a child together born on 7th August 2015.  She  further  confirmed
    exercising her treaty rights by way of employment and that she and  her
    husband have been sending money to Pakistan in  order  to  support  the
    Appellants who have no other income.


16. Both witnesses were  cross-examined.   I  recorded  all  questions  and
    answers in my  Record  of  Proceedings  and  it  is  not  necessary  to
    reiterate them here.  If relevant I will refer  to  the  oral  evidence
    when I set out my conclusions and reasons.


17. At the conclusion of oral evidence I heard oral submissions.  On behalf
    of the  Respondent  it  was  submitted  that  the  Appellants  had  not
    discharged the burden  of  proof  in  order  to  show  that  they  were
    financially dependent upon the Sponsor.  I was asked to note that there
    was no witness statement from the brother of the  first  Appellant  who
    provided free accommodation and  who  had  provided  financial  support
    until March 2016.  I was asked to find that as the Appellants  had  not
    proved dependency the appeals should be dismissed.


18. On behalf of the Appellants it was submitted that the burden  of  proof
    had been discharged.  I was asked to accept the evidence given  by  the
    witnesses at the hearing.  There  was  a  letter  at  page  49  of  the
    Appellants' bundle to confirm that the first Appellant  had  employment
    until January 2016 and thereafter was not  in  employment  and  had  no
    income.  This letter came from the first Appellant's previous employer.




19. I was also asked to note the affidavit from the head of the Appellants'
    village which confirmed that the first and  second  Appellants  had  no
    employment and were receiving funds from the UK.


20. I was asked to accept the oral evidence of Mr Anwar who when asked what
    his family spent the money on that they received from the UK, confirmed
    that it was  spent  on  food,  medicine,  school  fees  for  the  third
    Appellant, and doctor's fees, as well as paying the  first  Appellant's
    brother for the cost of utilities such as gas, electricity and water.


21. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.








My Conclusions and Reasons


22. The issue that I must decide relates to dependency.  The  test  that  I
    apply is that stated at paragraph 32 of Lim  referred  to  above.   The
    burden of proof is on the Appellants and the standard  of  proof  is  a
    balance of probability.


23. The preserved findings from the FtT hearing are that  the  Sponsor  has
    been sending funds to the Appellants since March 2016, the relationship
    between the Sponsor and Appellants is as claimed, and the Sponsor is  a
    qualified person as she is exercising treaty rights as a worker in  the
    UK.


24. I have considered all the evidence, both oral and documentary.  I  find
    the evidence given by the two witnesses to be credible.   The  evidence
    was not undermined by cross-examination.


25. I accept that documentary evidence submitted at the hearing proves that
    between 19th March 2016 and 7th December 2018 the Sponsor sent funds to
    the Appellants on 34 separate occasions.  The amount  of  money  varied
    between �143 and �300.


26. I accept that the first Appellant was in employment until January  2014
    and has  not  had  employment  since.   Neither  the  second  or  third
    Appellants have had any employment.   I  conclude  that  they  live  in
    accommodation provided by the first Appellant's brother for which  they
    do not pay rent, but for which they make a contribution to the  utility
    bills.  This contribution is paid for using the  funds  sent  from  the
    Sponsor in the UK.


27. I am  satisfied  that  the  first  Appellant's  brother  provided  some
    financial support up until 2016.  He no longer does so because  he  has
    his own family to support including two children, and money is provided
    by the Sponsor and her husband in the UK.


28. I find that a combination of the oral evidence and documentary evidence
    satisfies the burden of proof.  Without the  funds  from  the  UK,  the
    Appellants would be unable to support themselves.  The  funds  sent  by
    the Sponsor and her husband are necessary to enable the  Appellants  to
    meet their basic needs.


29. I therefore conclude that the Appellants  have  proved  that  they  are
    dependent upon the Sponsor in the UK, and as that was  the  only  issue
    remaining in dispute, I allow the appeals of the Appellants as they are
    entitled to EEA family permits.


Notice of Decision



The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and  was
set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeals are allowed.


Anonymity


The FtT made no anonymity direction.  There was no application made  to  the
Upper Tribunal for an anonymity direction and I see no need to make such  an
order.

FEE AWARD



As I have allowed the appeals I have considered whether to make fee  awards.
 I make no fee awards.  The appeals have been allowed  because  of  evidence
considered by the Tribunal that was not before the initial  decision  maker.
