Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Ghani, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, a citizen of Pakistan, appeals with  permission  to  the
    Upper Tribunal against the decision of  a  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Makka) dismissing  her  appeal  against  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    Islamabad's refusal to grant her entry  clearance  to  the  UK  as  the
    spouse of Yasir Hussain ("the Sponsor").



Background

 2. There is a background to this matter and it is necessary to recite this
    in some detail.

 3. The Appellant applied for entry clearance which  was  refused  on  18th
    August 2015.  In refusing the application the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    ("the ECO") set out that he was not satisfied that the Appellant  could
    meet the financial requirements  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Essentially, this was on account of the  evidence  relating  to
    the Sponsor's employment.

 4. Although the Appellant had submitted  employment  documents  apparently
    showing that the Sponsor was employed as a  caretaker  with  a  company
    called  Safehands  Solution  (Management)  Limited,  the  ECO  was  not
    satisfied about the veracity of the Sponsor's employment.

 5. The ECO noted that the Sponsor claimed a salary of  �19,320  per  annum
    but also noted in particular that the company appeared to  be  situated
    at a residential address and had not filed any accounts.  He  said  the
    following;  "  I  note  that  you  provide  no   official   independent
    documentation to verify your sponsor's employment. Therefore  from  the
    documents submitted (my emphasis) and the checks carried out I  am  not
    satisfied that your sponsor is employed as claimed"

 6. The ECO further noted that the Appellant had stated  that  if  she  was
    granted entry clearance she  would  reside  with  the  Sponsor  at  his
    parents' address.  The ECO could not be satisfied therefore in light of
    his doubts over the Sponsor's salary that there would be no reliance on
    third party funds.

 7. The Appellant appealed  the  Respondent's  refusal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The original grounds of appeal set out that the ECO  was  in
    error because he had apparently mistaken the nature  of  the  Sponsor's
    employment which was that he was employed as a caretaker  by  Safehands
    Solution, not at the company's address  but  at  properties  which  the
    company managed  elsewhere.  More  importantly  however  the  specified
    employment documents had been submitted with the application  and  this
    evidence had been overlooked.

FtT Hearing

 8. When the appeal came before the FtT, it was heard on the papers at  the
    Appellant's  request.   It  came  before  Judge   Makka   at   Richmond
    Magistrates' Court.

 9. It is fair to say that the judge identified that the real issue in  the
    appeal centred on the Sponsor's employment, but thereafter it is  clear
    that the judge misunderstood the evidence which  was  before  him.   He
    confused the name of the Sponsor, Yasir Hussain,  with  that  of  Nasir
    Hussain who is the managing director of Safehands Solution (Management)
    Limited Company (i.e. the Sponsor's  employer).   The  judge  therefore
    treated the Sponsor's evidence concerning his salary, as if he  were  a
    company director rather than an employee.  He went on  to  dismiss  the
    appeal.

Permission to appeal

10. Permission to appeal was granted on two bases:

    (1)  The judge had proceed on a mistake of fact which  amounted  to  an
    error; and

    (2)  There was a question raised  over  which  documents  the  ECO  had
    looked at when making his decision.

    The grant of permission set out that it would be "necessary to  examine
    the original application form to see what the appellant said about  her
    sponsor's financial circumstances."

Error of Law

11. The matter first came before me on 15th September  2016.   I  adjourned
    the proceedings because the ECO's bundle was still missing and  neither
    party was ready to proceed. I issued directions that relevant copies of
    the documents put before the ECO when the application was made were  to
    be obtained.

12. The hearing resumed on 8th November 2016. Mr Ghani handed in  a  bundle
    of documents which he said corresponded with the documents sent to  the
    ECO with the original application. Mr Harrison raised no objection.

13. First it is right that I deal with the issue of  whether  there  is  an
    error of law disclosed in the FtT's decision. I am satisfied  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal must  be  set  aside  for  material
    error.  It was argued by Mr Harrison that he accepted that the FtT  had
    erred in confusing the Sponsor with his employer, nevertheless he  said
    this was not material.  The judge had looked at the evidence  available
    and although he had mistakenly treated the Sponsor  as  if  he  were  a
    company director, nevertheless the fact remained that the  ECO  refused
    the application because the required documentation  necessary  to  meet
    Appendix FM-SE had not been served.  The appeal was bound  to  fail  in
    any event.

14. I find against Mr Harrison on  the  following  basis.  The  very  issue
    before me amounts to  whether  or  not  the  specified  documents  were
    attached to the Appellant's application. The original grounds of appeal
    clearly set out this issue. I find that  the  FtT  failed  to  properly
    assess the evidence probably because focus was lost when it  mistakenly
    confused the respective positions of the Sponsor and  his  employer.  I
    have no hesitation in setting aside the FtT's decision.

Remaking the Decision

15. I asked both representatives whether there was any further evidence  to
    bring to my attention should the decision need to be re-made.   Neither
    party had anything further to add to their  submissions  already  made.
    Both were of the view that I had all the required evidence before me to
    remake the decision, and that the decision could be remade in the Upper
    Tribunal.  I agree with that course.

16. Mr Ghani referred to his skeleton argument  which  sets  out  that  the
    Sponsor is employed as a  caretaker  for  a  company  called  Safehands
    Solution (Management) Limited and had been since 9th January 2014.   He
    submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  provided   the   Sponsor's   bank
    statements, corresponding wage slips and P60.  The  specified  evidence
    as set out in the Rules had therefore been submitted to the ECO showing
    that the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules were met.   He
    said that was all that was necessary for an Appellant  relying  on  her
    Sponsor's salary. From the ECO's reasons for refusal  it  would  appear
    that the ECO had not taken issue with those documents.

17. Further, he said, the ECO had wrongly taken issue about  the  viability
    of the Sponsor's employer. The ECO had taken exception to  the  company
    operating from a residential address.  There is no rule saying that the
    company's registered address  could  not  be  a  residential  one.   No
    trading as such  is  carried  out  at  this  address.   Copies  of  the
    company's  annual  returns  and  company's  registration  status   were
    attached.  At the date of application the company was not  required  to
    submit its accounts, because the date of decision was 18th August  2015
    and the  first  accounts  were  not  required  to  be  submitted  until
    September 2015.

18. The Entry Clearance Officer had claimed that the Appellant had provided
    no  official  independent  documentation  to   verify   her   Sponsor's
    employment.  Mr Ghani referred to the P60, the  company's  registration
    document and the Sponsor's bank statements which had all been supplied.
    He  said  that  those  documents  amounted   to   sufficient   official
    independent documentation to meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules and the appeal should therefore be allowed.

19. Mr Harrison in his submissions kept to the lines of the ECO's  refusal.
    He said that the fact remained that the documentation necessary to meet
    Appendix FM-SE was not supplied either  with  the  application  nor  as
    foreseeable post-decision documentation.  The ECO had  raised  concerns
    over the company from checks he had made.

20. At the end of submissions I reserved my decision which I now give  with
    reasons.

Findings and Reasons

21. I find I am satisfied on balance that the Appellant meets the financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules under Appendix  FM.  The  central
    issue revolves around the Sponsor's employment.   The  difficulty  that
    arises in this appeal concerns which evidential documents were attached
    to the Appellant's original application.

22. In order to meet the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules an
    applicant must provide the following  specified  evidence  showing  her
    Sponsor's employment, as set out in Appendix FM-SE of the Rules;

       . Payslips covering a period  of  6  months  prior  to  the  date  of
         application

       . a letter from the employer who  issued  the  payslips  showing  the
         gross annual salary

       . personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period  as  the
         payslips.

23. Evidence of the above documents is sufficient  to  meet  the  financial
    requirements rule. The Sponsor has always maintained that the specified
    documents set out in Appendix FM-SE  were  sent  and  attached  to  the
    Appellant's application. Unfortunately the ECO when  referring  to  the
    application in his refusal latter simply says that he has taken account
    of "your passport" and "the supporting documents you provided."   There
    is however no itemised list  of  the  supporting  documents  that  were
    provided.

24. I have regard to the documents that were  included  in  the  bundle  of
    evidence put before me, which included the following:

       . Six payslips  from  Safehands  Solution  (Management)  Ltd  showing
         monthly salary payments made to the Sponsor from November  2014  to
         April 2015 inclusive

       . Santander  bank  statements  showing  corresponding  payments  from
         Safehands Solution Ltd credited to the Sponsor's account at monthly
         intervals for the eight months from September 2014  to  April  2015
         inclusive

       . A P60 End of Year Certificate showing  that  the  Sponsor  received
         gross pay of �18,675.00 from Safehands  Solution  (Management)  Ltd
         for the tax year ending 05 April 2015

       . A letter dated 08 May 2015 from Nasir Hussain, Managing Director of
         Safehands Solution (Management) Ltd, stating that  the  Sponsor  is
         employed by his company since 09 January 2014 at an  annual  salary
         of �19,320.

    I note from the payslips that the  Sponsor's  basic  monthly  pay  from
    January 2015 onwards was �1610.00. This equates to an annual salary  of
    �19,320.00

25. I conclude therefore that the Appellant  has  satisfied  the  financial
    requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  by  providing  the  specified
    evidence showing her Sponsor's employment, as set out in Appendix FM-SE
    of the Rules.  No evidence has been placed before me that would lead me
    to conclude that these documents were not made  available  to  the  ECO
    when he made his decision.

26. Furthermore I note that the ECO took issue concerning the viability  of
    the  Sponsor's  employer.   However  these  concerns  have  only   been
    expressed in vague, general terms without any specific  evidence  being
    placed before me.  On the contrary, the documentary evidence before  me
    clearly shows that Safehands Solution (Management) Ltd is registered at
    Companies House, with their initial accounts  due  in  September  2015.
    Additionally, the  company  has  been  issued  with  an  Employer  PAYE
    reference by HMRC.  I see no reason why the company should not  operate
    from a residential address.   In  the  absence  therefore  of  explicit
    evidence  concerning  any  unfavourable  issues  pertaining   to   this
    particular employer, I am unable to place weight on the ECO's concerns.



27. In these circumstances I find I am satisfied  that  the  Appellant  has
    demonstrated that she meets the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.
    That should be sufficient to dispose of  this  matter.   However  I  am
    obliged to keep in mind that the only route of appeal for the Appellant
    in this matter is a claim that the Respondent's decision  unjustifiably
    interferes with her Article 8 ECHR family/private life. It was accepted
    by the ECO that his  decision  to  refuse  entry  would  amount  to  an
    interference with her Article 8 ECHR rights. As I  have  found  in  the
    Appellant's favour on the financial requirements of Appendix FM-SE,  it
    follows that I find that the ECO's decision  to  refuse  the  Appellant
    entry clearance on the basis that she does not satisfy the  Immigration
    Rules is a disproportionate one. In reaching  this  decision  I  stress
    that no other issues or evidence regarding the compliance or  otherwise
    with the Rules was raised before me.

28. Therefore for the foregoing reasons this appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for material error.   I
remake the decision, allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Entry
Clearance Officer's refusal to grant her entry to the UK.

No anonymity direction is made.
