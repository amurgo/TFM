                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge P-J
    S  White  ('the  Judge'),  issued  on  26  March  2019,  by  which  the
    appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent to refuse  to
    issue an EEA residence card was refused.

 2. The appellant appeals on all  grounds  with  permission  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Chohan by way of a decision dated 8 May 2019.


Anonymity

 3. No anonymity direction was issued by the Judge and no  application  for
    such direction was made before us.


Background

 4. The appellant is a Nigerian national  who  was  born  in  1970  and  is
    presently aged 49. She asserts that she entered this country  in  2004,
    utilising a visit visa arranged by an agent. The sponsor is  Mr.  Piotr
    [S], a Polish national, who was born in 1972. They married by way of  a
    customary marriage conducted by proxy in Nigeria on 18  February  2010.
    The appellant was issued with a residence card as the spouse of an  EEA
    national on 20 June 2011, valid until 20 June 2016.

 5. On 27 July 2013, the appellant was stopped on  re-entering  the  United
    Kingdom and interviewed by an immigration officer. Decisions were  made
    on 30 July 2013 to refuse her admission to this country and  to  revoke
    her residence card. She lodged an appeal on 5 August 2013 against these
    decisions but on 7 October 2013 she withdrew her appeal.

 6. On 11 October 2013 the appellant applied for a residence  card  as  the
    spouse of an EEA national and the respondent refused  this  application
    on 25 November 2013.

 7. The appellant made another  application  for  a  residence  card  on  2
    January 2014 and this was refused by way of a decision dated 27 January
    2014.

 8. A further application for a residence card was made on 5 December  2014
    and this was refused on 10 April 2015. The appellant filed an appeal on
    23 April 2015 but subsequently withdrew her appeal.

 9. The appellant applied for a residence card on 6 September 2016 and  the
    application was refused by the respondent on  7  July  2017.  She  made
    further applications for a residence card on 14 September 2017  and  28
    October 2017, both of which were refused.

10. An application for a residence card was made on 19  February  2018  and
    was refused by way of a  decision  on  29  June  2018.  The  respondent
    decided that the evidence submitted was insufficient to establish  that
    the appellant's customary marriage to Mr. [S]  was  valid.  The  second
    point taken was that in  an  interview  conducted  in  July  2013,  the
    appellant had admitted that the marriage was one  of  convenience.  The
    respondent concluded that in such circumstances the appellant  had  not
    acquired any rights by virtue of  her  marriage.  This  is  the  appeal
    against that decision.


The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

11. The appeal came before the Judge on 20 February  2019.  The  respondent
    was not represented and made no request for an  adjournment  was  made.
    The Judge was satisfied that there was  no  reason  to  do  other  than
    proceed  with  the  appeal  in  the  respondent's  absence.  The  Judge
    considered the validity of the marriage and  noted  that  the  decision
    letter spoke as to Ghanaian customary  marriage  law  in  circumstances
    where the appellant  is  a  Nigerian  national  and  the  marriage  was
    conducted by proxy in Nigeria. He decided that no evidential basis  had
    been provided by the respondent for the assertion that the marriage was
    formally invalid and so held that it was not.

12. As to the allegation that the marriage is one of convenience, the Judge
    observed that the issue as to whether the marriage was entered into for
    immigration advantage is to be determined at the date the  marriage  is
    contracted. When considering whether the respondent had met the initial
    evidential burden placed upon him as to raising the possibility of  the
    marriage being one of convenience, the Judge decided at [13] - [15]:

         'The respondent relies effectively on what the  appellant  and  Mr.
         [S] are alleged to have said in interviews in July 2013. I  do  not
         have contemporaneous notes of either interview.  I  have  only  the
         notice of decision from July 2013. This is over the typed signature
         for a named Immigration Officer.  It  records  that  the  appellant
         admitted in interview that her marriage  was  one  of  convenience,
         that she has spent only 3 months with him after  the  marriage  and
         that she was currently living with her sister. Mr. [S] was said  to
         have told the respondent, in an interview in Polish,  that  he  did
         not consider himself married to the appellant  but  considered  her
         his girlfriend.


         The notice is clearly less satisfactory as evidence than a detailed
         witness statement or the production of notes of the interviews.  It
         seems to me however that it does have some evidential  value  as  a
         signed account of what has been said by the appellant and Mr.  [S].
         That view is reinforced by two facts. One is that both she  and  he
         accept that some  sort  of  interview  took  place  at  that  time,
         although they  dispute  what  was  said.  The  other  is  that  the
         appellant, having lodged an appeal, then withdrew it, thus  leaving
         this decision and the assertions on which it relied unchallenged at
         the time, although that was when she and Mr. [S] might be  expected
         best to remember and describe what was really  said.  I  find  that
         decision very curious, and the appellant's explanation, for reasons
         discussed below, unsatisfactory.


         In the circumstances I am satisfied  that  the  initial  evidential
         burden, of raising a case to answer,  is  discharged.  It  is  then
         necessary to consider the appellant's account and reach a  decision
         on whether, in the light of all the evidence, the legal  burden  is
         discharged.'

13. The Judge proceeded to  assess  the  evidence  presented.  He  was  not
    satisfied that either the appellant or Mr. [S] were reliable witnesses.
    He noted at [20] that after nine years of marriage  the  couple  stated
    that they speak to each other in English, though Mr. [S] accepted  that
    he speaks and understands the language 'a little'. He further  observed
    that Mr. [S] only remembered during re-examination that he  had  taught
    the appellant some Polish. The Judge detailed the conflicting  evidence
    of  the  appellant  and  Mr.  [S]  as  to  their  living  arrangements,
    concluding at [21] that 'the disagreement about the terms on which they
    occupy [their home] is almost total.' He further  observed  as  to  Mr.
    [S]: 'Since his most recent tax statement shows a self-employed  profit
    of some �7,500 it is not clear how  he  affords  a  rent  of  �650  per
    month.' He was satisfied that the appellant had made admissions  as  to
    the marriage being  one  of  convenience  in  her  2013  interview  and
    determined that on the balance of probabilities the marriage was one of
    convenience and so no right of residence was conferred under Union law.




The grounds of appeal

14. There are three grounds of appeal before us. Ground 1 is that there was
    a failure to make proper findings. Ground 2 is entitled  'subjectivity'
    and details, inter alia, '... the Judge had subjectively believed  that
    the Immigration Officer at the interview on the day  did  not  lie  and
    that it was the appellant and her spouse who lied. It  therefore  seems
    that the Judge subjectively believed that so long as the documents were
    signed by an Immigration Officer, it stood to be correct and  credible;
    and as  such  has  therefore  proved  the  allegation  of  marriage  of
    convenience  against  the  appellant.  This  is  completely  subjective
    judgement [and] is therefore wrong.' Ground 3 details  that  the  Judge
    acted unfairly by relying upon his subjective belief.

15. In granting permission, Judge Chohan observed:

         'In short, the grounds argue that the judge failed to  make  proper
         findings in respect of  the  marriage  of  the  appellant  and  her
         spouse. It is further stated that the judge  placed  weight  on  an
         interview record in respect of which a copy had not been provided.


         The respondent relied  on  an  interview  record  conducted  by  an
         immigration officer in which it is alleged that the  appellant  had
         stated that her marriage was one of convenience. During the hearing
         before the judge, the appellant denied ever making that  statement.
         Nevertheless, the judge appears to have placed some weight on  that
         interview record and it is striking  to  note  that  there  was  no
         presenting officer at the hearing.


         It is open to argument that the judge may  have  erred  by  placing
         reliance on an interview record in respect of which the  respondent
         had not provided a copy. It must be remembered that the  respondent
         has an evidential burden of establishing a marriage of convenience.
         Had a presenting officer been present, matters may well  have  been
         clarified. Unfortunately, this was not the case.'


The hearing

16. Prior to the hearing, Mr. Jarvis made a formal  application  to  adduce
    new evidence and relied upon Rule  15(2A)  of  The  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008.  By  way  of  the  written  notice,  the
    respondent sought to adduce a GCID note dated 27 July 2013, summarising
    Mr. [S]'s telephone interview with an immigration officer  in  relation
    to his marriage to the  appellant  and  the  summary  of  a  subsequent
    interview conducted by the same immigration officer with the appellant.
    The notice detailed that it was  not  known  why  the  record  was  not
    included in the respondent's bundle  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    'but it is clear that due to operational difficulties there was  no  PO
    and therefore it could not have  been  provided  at  that  late  stage,
    equally the [appellant] had not pursued the appeal against the  refusal
    of admission decision.' The notice candidly observed,  'The  SSHD  asks
    the [Upper Tribunal] to note that the content of the record (it is  not
    a  transcript  in  respect  of  the  [appellant's]  oral  responses  to
    questions) could potentially  corroborate  some  of  the  [appellant's]
    evidence to the FtT in respect of the marriage of convenience issues as
    well as being relevant to her  claimed  husband's  evidence  about  the
    interview conducted with him at the same time. On that  basis,  and  in
    fairness to the [appellant] and her partner, the  SSHD  asks  that  the
    [Upper Tribunal] admit the evidence  for  the  purposes  of  the  error
    hearing when considering the [appellant's] appeal.' Mr. Jarvis  pursued
    the application at the hearing, and it was not opposed by Mr. Kaihiva.

17. We decided at the hearing to admit  the  evidence,  observing  that  it
    would aid in our  consideration  as  to  whether  the  Judge  erred  in
    proceeding in the absence  of  the  relevant  interview  records:  Rule
    24(1)(c) of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration
    and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2004  ('the  First-tier  Tribunal  Procedure
    Rules'). Upon admission  of  the  document,  Mr.  Jarvis  candidly  and
    appropriately observed that the respondent wished  to  act  fairly  and
    favoured a pragmatic resolution of the case. He  accepted  that  though
    the appellant had initiated an appeal in 2013 against  the  refusal  of
    leave to enter and the revocation of her residence card, such decisions
    being consequent to her interview on 27 July 2013, the appeal had  been
    withdrawn and so the First-tier Tribunal had not previously  considered
    the interview record. He  conceded  that  in  such  circumstances,  the
    respondent was required to provide the interview record and  failed  to
    satisfy the obligation placed upon him.


Decision on error of law

18. We allowed the appellant's appeal on the day of the hearing, confirming
    that our reasons would follow. We have much sympathy for the Judge  who
    sat in the absence of a presenting officer and was  not  asked  by  the
    appellant to adjourn the hearing so that the records of interview could
    be secured. He was required to consider  a  decision  letter,  much  of
    which erroneously considered the position of proxy marriages  conducted
    in Ghana, which is of no relevance to this  appeal.  He  took  care  to
    consider  the  evidence  before  him,  some  of   which   was   clearly
    inconsistent and unsatisfactory, and made careful findings of  fact  on
    the evidence  before  him.  We  observe  that  there  was  no  specific
    challenge by way of appeal as to the findings at [20] -  [23].  Rather,
    the focus of  the  challenge  concerns  the  Judge's  approach  to  the
    interviews conducted in July 2013. We find that as the interviews  were
    relied upon by the respondent in the decision letter of June  2018,  he
    was required to provide  copies  of  these  interview  records  to  the
    Tribunal and the appellant. Though the appellant  did  not  request  an
    adjournment and an accompanying direction that the respondent file  and
    serve the interviews, the Judge  was  required  to  observe  that  Rule
    24(1)(c) of the First-tier Procedure Rules is mandatory in  nature  and
    it was unfair to proceed in circumstances where the appellant  and  Mr.
    [S] sought to assert their recollection of events in the absence of the
    interview records.

19. We observe that the respondent's decision of June 2018 expressly relied
    upon the appellant's interview detailing, 'During  that  interview  you
    were asked whether your marriage was a genuine one  or  a  marriage  of
    convenience and you replied - "yes - a marriage of convenience,  it  is
    easy for me."'  The Judge adversely relied upon  this  element  of  the
    decision letter. We observe that consideration  of  this  question  and
    answer requires an assessment of the interview as a whole, the  context
    in which the question was advanced and consideration as to whether  the
    appellant understood the technical question she was being asked. In the
    absence of the interview record, we  find  that  the  Judge  could  not
    fairly answer such questions.

20. We therefore find that the failure to adjourn the  hearing  and  direct
    that the relevant records of  interview  be  filed  and  served  was  a
    material error of law and though various other findings were  carefully
    made, we are in agreement with both representatives  that  the  failure
    was so fundamental that none of the findings can stand.


Remittal to First-Tier Tribunal

21. Under Part 3 paragraph 7.2(b) of the Upper Tribunal Practice  Statement
    of the 25 September 2012 the case may be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

    (a)    the effect of the error has been to deprive a party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


    (b)    the nature or extent of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

22. In this case we have determined that the adverse  credibility  findings
    cannot stand. The appeal will be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal so
    that a new  fact-finding  exercise  can  be  undertaken.  None  of  the
    findings of fact are to stand and a complete re-hearing is necessary.


Notice of Decision

23. For all of these reasons, the decision discloses an error on a point of
    law such that it must be set aside. We set aside the  Judge's  decision
    promulgated on 26 March  2019  pursuant  to  section  12(2)(a)  of  the
    Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.


Direction

24. We remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor  House
    to be heard before any First-tier Judge other than Judge White.
