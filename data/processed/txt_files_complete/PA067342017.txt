               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs Aboni, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Jowett instructed by Irving & Co

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a  national  of  Somalia  born  on  [~]  1983.   In  a
    determination dated 22nd of November 2017,  Judge  of  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal Solly, refused the appellant's appeal against  deportation  on
    asylum, humanitarian protection and Article 3 grounds but  allowed  the
    claim on Article 8  grounds.  The  Secretary  of  State  appealed  that
    decision in relation to Article 8.

 2. The appellant was convicted in 2012 of 2  counts  of  possession  of  a
    Class A drug, Heroin, with intent to supply and sentenced  to  3  years
    and 2 years concurrently on each count.

 3. The appellant is married with 2 British citizen children and the First-
    tier Tribunal judge found the appellant fulfilled the  exception  under
    paragraphs 398(c) and 399(a)(i) (a).

         399.     This paragraph applies where  paragraph  398  (b)  or  (c)
         applies if -

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is  in
             the UK, and

                  (i)  the child is a British Citizen; or

                  (ii) the child has lived in the  UK  continuously  for  at
                  least the 7 years immediately preceding the  date  of  the
                  immigration decision; and in either case

                      (a)   it would be unduly harsh for the child to  live
                      in the country to which the person is to be deported;
                      and

                      (b)   it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the  child  to
                      remain in the UK without the  person  who  is  to  be
                      deported; or ...

 4. I set out the litigation history for clarity.  The Secretary  of  State
    made an application for permission asserting that the judge had allowed
    the appeal, on Article 8  grounds,  by  finding  that  the  appellant's
    deportation would lead to unduly harsh consequences for his children Ah
    aged two and Ay aged one. In coming to that conclusion, the  judge  had
    materially erred in law.  The  judge  had  failed  to  give  sufficient
    weight to the public interest and although the risk of reoffending  was
    low as referred to in paragraph 62 the judge  failed  to  consider  the
    deterrent effect as illustrated in AM v SSHD [2012] EWCA  Civ  1634  at
    paragraph 24.  The assessment of unduly harsh was incomplete  with  the
    judge not conducting a comprehensive balancing exercise.

 5. The factors identified by the judges  in  considering  'unduly  harsh',
    either singularly or cumulatively, failed to meet the high threshold of
    being 'unduly harsh'. It  was  acknowledged  at  paragraph  64  of  the
    determination that it was accepted that it was in the best interests of
    the children for the appellant to remain in the United Kingdom  but  in
    deportation appeals the test was significantly higher and reliance  was
    placed on AJ (Zimbabwe) EWCA Civ 1012 at paragraph 31 which states

         'it was not open to the FTT to find  that  the  separation  of  the
         children from the father/stepfather  was  a  compelling  reason  to
         allow the respondent to  remain.  Far  from  being  an  exceptional
         circumstance, this is an everyday situation as  the  authorities  I
         have set out demonstrate. They show that the separating parent  and
         child cannot, without more, be a good reason to outweigh  the  very
         powerful public interest deportation. No doubt the FTT was right to
         say  that  these  children  would  unfortunately  suffer  from  the
         separation but for the reasons I have  already  explained,  if  the
         concept of exceptional circumstances can apply  in  such  case,  it
         would undermine the application of the immigration rules'.

 6. That the family were likely to require state  benefits  was  a  neutral
    factor.  There was significant number of one parent families in the  UK
    and  that  did  not  signify  that  they  would  suffer  unduly   harsh
    conditions. It was also submitted that the social worker's  report  was
    emotive rather than objective. The  judge  referred  to  a  significant
    detrimental effect of the appellant being deported at paragraph  69  of
    the determination but that was  akin  to  the  normal  consequences  of
    deportation, and, failed to identify  what  was  unduly  harsh  if  the
    appellant was deported, and,  had  additionally  failed  to  deal  with
    paragraph 84 of the decision letter that is in effect the  respondent's
    skeleton argument.  This identified that the children would continue to
    benefit from  the  rights  and  privileges  that  are  entitled  to  by
    remaining in the UK. There was a wider family unit by way  of  paternal
    extended family members.   Those  members  could  continue  to  provide
    support for the mother and children in the UK.   There  were  financial
    support mechanisms in place for British citizens.

 7. The judge failed to give clear reasons why the appellant's  deportation
    would result in 'unduly harsh' consequences for the children

 8. There was no OASys report. The Secretary of State also  submitted  that
    the judge, in reaching his conclusions had treated the public  interest
    too  narrowly.  Court  of  Appeal  authorities  had   emphasised   that
    Parliament  approved  automatic  deportation   of   foreign   criminals
    convicted and sentenced to imprisonment  of  over  a  year  and  if  an
    appellant received a sentence of over one year very significant  weight
    was required to outweigh deportation.

 9. The judge failed to acknowledge the  deterrent  effect  in  deportation
    which contributed to the public confidence  in  the  system.  This  was
    despite the fact that the sentence was some time ago. Mr  Mills  relied
    on MM (Uganda)v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 617 and AJ (Zimbabwe) [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 1012.  The decision was unsafe. The test  in  relation  to  "unduly
    harsh" had a high bar and the judge  had  not  recognised  that.   That
    separation would significantly upset the children as  outlined  by  the
    social workers report was recognised but something more than  that  was
    required in order to outweigh the imperative of deportation.

10. In response, the appellant's representative pointed out that  this  was
    not a sentence over four years and the judge had considered the concept
    of "unduly harsh", specifically at paragraphs 65 and 66.  Reliance  had
    been placed on the witness statements together with the social worker's
    report and that was not challenged by the Home Office.  Nor  was  there
    challenge to the section 72 findings.  This  appellant  was  not  in  a
    higher category of offender and there was no error of law

11. The social worker report  of  Diana  Harris  dated  22  September  2017
    prepared a balance sheet of the benefits and burdens to the children of
    the father's return to Somalia.   She noted that the  appellant  was  a
    primary attachment figure for both children and  actively  involved  in
    basic day-to-day care. She outlined that the children would  be  likely
    to experience feelings and behaviours associated with  grief  and  loss
    akin to the death of a parent and their routine and stability would  be
    disrupted  and  would  be  likely  to  impact  on   developmental   and
    educational progress. Further, lack of  family  resources  would  place
    limitations on the ability of the children  to  participate  in  social
    activities.

Conclusions on the Error of Law

12. I have set out the terms of the application for  permission  to  appeal
    and the competing arguments before me in relation to the error  of  law
    stage in  order  to  set  the  context  for  the  resumed  hearing  and
    consequent decision.  I did not set aside the findings  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal but the conclusions as I found the reasoning  inadequate.
     Subsequent to my error of law decision the Supreme Court has Case  law
    has published KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53.  I record what I said in  my
    error of law decision below the following:

         'Caselaw has emphasised the test of "unduly harsh" is a  high  test
         and the separation  of  parent  and  child  in  deportation  is  an
         everyday situation and, without more, cannot be a  good  reason  to
         outweigh the very powerful public interest in deportation.

         There was no challenge to the social  worker's  report  or  to  the
         evidence of the appellant's wife,  that  evidence,  in  itself,  as
         reflected in the  decision  of  the  first-tier  Tribunal  did  not
         support undue harshness, when considering  the  conviction  of  the
         appellant for intent to supply class A drugs, or even approach  the
         required threshold of "unduly harsh"  with  regards  fulfilment  of
         paragraph 399(a) (see MM (Uganda).  DW (Jamaica)  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
         797 has confirmed that 'The new rules  [the  immigration  rules  as
         amended] were an index of the enhanced importance the Secretary  of
         State attaches to the public interest in the deportation of foreign
         criminals' and that the public interest is to be given due weight'.
          The children's interests are a  primary  factor  but  need  to  be
         stronger the more pressing the more serious the offence.  The  task
         is to balance the interests.  The phrase 'unduly harsh'  is  to  be
         determined by reference to context with due  weight  given  to  the
         public interest.

         In this instance, at best, from reading  the  decision,  the  judge
         identified only difficulties as to how the children and wife  would
         cope without the appellant, and that the interests  of  the  family
         would be better served when he was present, but there  was  nothing
         which demonstrated, even in the  social  worker  report,  that  the
         removal would be 'unduly harsh' in the context of  deportation.  As
         such the public interest was accorded insufficient weight and  that
         approach to the public interest was an error of law'.

The Resumed Hearing

13. At the resumed hearing I heard evidence from the  appellant,  his  wife
    and his witness Mr NA.  His children were present.  His wife  explained
    how much the appellant did for the children.

14. Before me Mrs Aboni, submitted that the particulars  of  the  appellant
    and his children were not such as to constitute an unduly harsh result.
      That the wife would be solely reliant and reliant on public  benefits
    was a neutral factor.

15. Mr Jowett referred me to his skeleton argument and paragraph 23  of  KO
    (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53 which alluded to a degree  of  harshness  over
    and above what would necessarily be involved for any child  faced  with
    deportation.

Conclusions

16. At the outset I note that although I found fault  with  the  First-tier
    Tribunal judge's assessment, the findings in relation to  the  evidence
    were not set aside.    As identified, the Secretary of  State  did  not
    challenge the expert report  save  to  state  in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal that it was 'emotive'.

17. Between the Error of Law stage and the resume hearing KO (Nigeria)  was
    promulgated by the Supreme Court which now explains that  the  approach
    to be taken with regard to Section 117C, (which is similar to  that  of
    paragraph 399, which in turn sets out the exceptions  to  the  rule  of
    deportation under paragraph 398).  The approach does

         'not require a balancing of relative  levels  of  severity  of  the
         parent's offence, other than is inherent in the  distinction  drawn
         by the section'.

    My Error of Law decision  referred  to  and  relied  on  precisely  the
    approach adopted in MM (Uganda) and that approach has subsequently been
    disapproved.

18. Paragraph 399 and Section 117C read as follows

         399.     This paragraph applies where  paragraph  398  (b)  or  (c)
         applies if -

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is  in
             the UK, and

                  (i)  the child is a British Citizen; or

                  (ii) the child has lived in the  UK  continuously  for  at
                  least the 7 years immediately preceding the  date  of  the
                  immigration decision; and in either case

                      (a)   it would be unduly harsh for the child to  live
                      in the country to which the person is to be deported;
                      and

                      (b)   it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the  child  to
                      remain in the UK without the  person  who  is  to  be
                      deported; or

             (b) the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with
             a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled
             in the UK, and

                  (i)  the relationship was formed at a time when the person
                  (deportee) was in the UK lawfully  and  their  immigration
                  status was not precarious; and

                  (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live  in
                  the country to which the person is to be deported, because
                  of compelling circumstances over and above those described
                  in paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

                  (iii)      it would be unduly harsh for  that  partner  to
                  remain in the UK without the person who is to be deported

         117C  Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

             (1) The deportation of foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
             interest.

             (2) The more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
             criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of
             the criminal.

             (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has  not  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,
             the public interest requires C's deportation unless  Exception
             1 or Exception 2 applies.

             (4) Exception 1 applies where-

                  (a)  C has been lawfully resident in  the  United  Kingdom
                  for most of C's life,

                  (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                  Kingdom, and

                  (c)  there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to  be
                  deported.

             (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.

19. At  Paragraph  21  of  KO  (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC  53,  Lord  Carnwath
    specifically observes with regard the exceptions  under  paragraph  399
    that

         'for a sentence of less than four years, they are enough,  if  they
         are  met,  to  remove  the  public  interest  in  deportation.  For
         sentences of four years or more, however, it is not enough to  fall
         within the exception, unless there are in addition "very compelling
         circumstances"

    And in relation to exception 2

         '22.     ... although the language is  perhaps  less  precise  that
         that of exception 1, there is nothing  to  suggest  that  the  word
         'unduly' is intended as a reference back to the issue  of  relative
         seriousness introduced by subsection (2).  ... 'exception 2 appears
         self-contained'.

         23.      On the other hand  the  expression  "unduly  harsh"  seems
         clearly  intended  to  introduce  a  higher  hurdle  than  that  of
         "reasonableness" under  section  117B(6),  taking  account  of  the
         public interest in the deportation of  foreign  criminals.  Further
         the word "unduly" implies an element of comparison. It assumes that
         there is a "due" level of "harshness", that is a level which may be
         acceptable or justifiable in the relevant context. "Unduly" implies
         something going beyond that level. The relevant context is that set
         by section 117C(1), that is the public interest in the  deportation
         of foreign criminals. One is looking  for  a  degree  of  harshness
         going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced
         with the deportation of a parent. What it does not  require  in  my
         view (and subject to the discussion of the cases  in  Page  11  the
         next section) is a balancing of relative levels of severity of  the
         parent's offence, other than is inherent in the  distinction  drawn
         by the section itself by  reference  to  length  of  sentence.  Nor
         (contrary to the view of the Court of  Appeal  in  IT  (Jamaica)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  932,
         [2017] 1  WLR  240,  paras  55,  64)  can  it  be  equated  with  a
         requirement to show "very compelling reasons".  That  would  be  in
         effect to replicate the additional test applied by section  117C(6)
         with respect to sentences of four years or more'.

20. This concludes that a higher hurdle, 'unduly harsh', is set in relation
    to foreign criminal as defined under Section 117D compared  with  those
    not classified as foreign criminals.   (Foreign criminals are described
    thus in Section 117D

         (2)      In this Part, "foreign criminal" means a person-

             (a) who is not a British citizen,

             (b) who has  been  convicted  in  the  United  Kingdom  of  an
             offence, and

             (c) who-

                  (i)  has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  at
                  least 12 months,

                  (ii) has been convicted of  an  offence  that  has  caused
                  serious harm, or

                  (iii)      is a persistent offender.

21. As Lord Carnwath explains, the test involves a relativity or comparison
    with the  harshness  that  would  be  for  any  child  faced  with  the
    deportation of their parent.  This begs the question as to what is this
    standard level of harshness? It is clearly more than reasonable and  is
    described in terms of 'due harshness'.  What is clear, however, is that
    the test does not required a balancing of the levels of severity of the
    parent's offences over and above the distinction drawn by  the  section
    itself.

22. MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2015]
    UKUT 223  (IAC),  gives  authoritative  guidance  in  relation  to  the
    standard  for  'unduly  harsh'  and  laid  down  that  an   "evaluative
    assessment" was required of the tribunal:

         "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh'  does
         not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or  merely
         difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated threshold.
         'Harsh' in this context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It  is
         the  antithesis  of  pleasant  or  comfortable.  Furthermore,   the
         addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an already elevated standard
         still higher."

23. The focus must be on the child and not  involve  a  balancing  exercise
    with regard the offending of the parent which has already been factored
    in through the delineation of the test by virtue of the sentence.   The
    approach taken in MM (Uganda) was that 'the  more  serious  he  offence
    committed by a foreign criminal the greater is the public interests  in
    deportation' and that unduly harsh should incorporate consideration  of
    all the circumstances including the offending of the  foreign  criminal
    not merely the impact on the child or partner.  This approach in MM was
    disapproved by the Supreme Court.

24. The appellant entered the United Kingdom with his father at the age  of
    12 with his father and brother and he was granted Indefinite  Leave  to
    Remain on the basis of family  reunion.   The  appellant  was  educated
    here.  Following his conviction for two drugs offence committed in 2011
    he was served with a notice of liability to  automatic  deportation  on
    10th December 2012.  His representatives raised protection and  Article
    8 grounds.  The appellant had married his partner  MDO  on  27th  April
    2014.  Following judicial review proceedings in 2014 the appellant  was
    permitted to work.  He has two British  citizen  children,  both  boys,
    born on 6th April 2015 and 18th April 2016.  They are  now  3�  and  2�
    years old.

25. I will rehearse the findings of the First-tier Tribunal and with which,
    on my own analysis, I concur.   I repeat that I did not set aside these
    findings. The judge accepted

         (i)      the appellant's income is the sole source of income and if
         she leaves her studies and  the  appellant  is  deported  she  will
         become dependent on benefits

         (ii)     on the basis of the probation report the appellant did not
         constitute any danger to the community.  There were no  aggravating
         factors identified by the sentencing  judge.  There  have  been  no
         offences since 2012 and the appellant has married, settled down and
         become a father.  [62]

         (iii)    the Home Office accepted that it is in the best  interests
         of the children for the current  domestic  arrangements  to  remain
         intact. [64]

         (iv)     the appellant and his wife were in  a  stable  and  secure
         marriage and rely on one another for emotional support

26. There was no OASys report to indicate  a  risk  of  re-offending.   The
    letter from the Wales Probation dated 5th March 2014 confirmed that the
    appellant  was  a  'motivated  individual  who   is   working   towards
    successfully completing his licence later this year'.  The letter dated
    24th October 2017 from the Wales Probation office  confirmed  that  the
    appellant's licence ended on 16th November 2014, and he was assessed as
    posing a low risk of both re-offending and harm.

27. The Guidance of the Secretary of State on Criminality: article  8  ECHR
    cases, states that Section 55 of the Borders and Citizenship  Act  2009
    is reflected in paragraph 399(a).  The  guidance  nonetheless  confirms
    that regard must be had to the best interests of the child as a primary
    consideration (but not the paramount  consideration).   It  is  in  the
    child's best interests to be cared for by both parents.  This  guidance
    states that consideration must be given to the history of offending and
    any expert evidence that the best interests are not served by the child
    being with the parent.

28. The children are both British citizens and young but on the evidence of
    their parents and their appearance at court, they are able to talk  and
    are extremely attached to their father.   They  have  lived  all  their
    lives in the UK.  It is clearly in the best interests of  the  children
    to remain in the care of both of their parents.

29. It was accepted by the Secretary of State at the hearing before me that
    there was no question that the children  would  be  expected  or  could
    relocate to Somalia.  Bearing in mind the problems in Somalia, this  is
    a sensible concession. The Secretary of  State's  own  policy  guidance
    cites the UN's description of the humanitarian situation as  precarious
    and that by any global measure it remains very grave.

30. I turn to whether it would be unduly harsh for the children  to  remain
    in the UK without their father who is classified as a foreign criminal.
      The reality is that it is unlikely that these children will see their
    father  again  for  many  years  should  he  be  removed  to   Somalia.
    Realistically, the cost and the danger of visiting him is likely to  be
    prohibitive. He would not be permitted to enter the United Kingdom.   I
    accept that the father and  mother  live  together.   It  would  appear
    however that because of the working pattern of the father  that  he  is
    the day to day carer  of  the  children.  It  was  evident  seeing  the
    interaction between the father with the children that he is  completely
    accustomed to caring for them and they are  being  cared  for  by  him.
    Separation from their father as their primary carer at this  age  would
    have very severe effect on them.

31. The mother is in the second year of an  Early  Years  Education  degree
    which she will complete in 2020 (evidenced in the  bundle).   She  told
    the court that she has  borrowed  money  to  finance  that  degree  and
    intends to train as a teacher for a year thereafter.  She  stated  that
    she could not afford to place the children in child care and thus would
    have to abandon her studies.  I consider this would have  an  extremely
    harsh effect on the mother and thus indirectly, too, on  the  children.
    As the mother explained there would be  significant  ramifications  for
    both her and the children if the family unit and  present  arrangements
    are  fractured.      I  accept  that  this  his  however   is   not   a
    determinative factor.

32. The assessment to be conducted is at the date of the hearing before me.
     The social worker (expert) report of Diana  Harris  was  conducted  in
    2017 when the children were much  younger.   As  Mr  Jowett  submitted,
    however, and  I  agree,  a  year  in  the  life  of  a  child  is  very
    significant.   I turn  to  the  expert  report.   Diana  Harris  is  an
    independent Social Worker.  She is  registered  to  practice  with  the
    Health Care Professions Council and a member of the British Association
    of Social Workers. She has a history of working in Children's Statutory
    Social Care Services from March 2001 until April 2016.  From that date,
    she has predominantly worked in a statutory Fostering  team  where  she
    has  supervised  foster  carers,  supervised  adoption  and   fostering
    assessments and delivered training. She  has  also  had  experience  of
    children's Duty Social Work,  completed  Children  in  Need  cases  and
    chaired  multi-agency  meetings.  She  has  addressed  the   compulsory
    training  in  social  work  which  includes  the  study   of   Lifespan
    Psychology, study of Social Work  with  Adults  and  Social  Work  with
    children.  Finally, she has experience of Early Intervention in a Youth
    Justice  Team   which   involved   in   work   including   preventative
    interventions and engaging with young people subject to  court  orders,
    with the aim of minimising the risk of offending behaviours.

33. I consider the expert to be well qualified and not overly 'emotive'  as
    suggested in the application for permission to appeal.  That was not an
    allegation that Mrs Aboni repeated, and I note that the  Social  Worker
    has engaged in Statutory Social Care Services. On a careful reading  of
    her report, she made a thorough and  comprehensive  assessment  of  the
    impact on the family of the deportation of the appellant.    There  was
    no challenge to the contents of the report by the Secretary of State.

34. Ms Harris opined that should the  father  be  removed  to  Somalia  the
    children would lose

         'a primary attachment figure... [which] would cause  them  feelings
         and behaviours associated with grief and loss...akin to  the  death
         of a parent.  At their young ages the effects of this are likely to
         be evidence in their emotions and behaviours'.

35. In her opinion, this would have an impact on 'their  developmental  and
    educational progress'.  She also concluded that a lack of finances  and
    resources would  place  limitations  of  their  ability  to  visit  and
    maintain contact over the short and longer term.

         'Their family composition would change to a single  parent  family,
         placing significant limitations on the family  resources  and  this
         would have an impact on their identity formation'.

36. I accept that placing this family on public benefits would be a neutral
    factor, but she was clearly of the opinion that removal at their  young
    age this would a particular effect.

37. Information on attachment theory was also  provided  which  highlighted
    the  importance  of  early  years  attachments  and   the   result   of
    interruption which was said to lead  in  later  life  to,  inter  alia,
    aggression and depression.

38. She recorded that the appellant's own difficult experiences had led him
    to volunteer for and support a number of community projects  for  young
    people and disadvantaged individuals such as a homeless  project  which
    he regularly supports, namely, Citizens Advice Youth Support Group  and
    Fresh Slate Youth Support Group.   This is not just a recent phenomenon
    and appears to have been ongoing.

39. The opinion  of  the  Social  Worker  was  in  turn  supported  by  two
    witnesses, one of whom attended the hearing before me and  attested  to
    knowing the appellant for some years and who had helped  the  appellant
    turn his life around. He described the appellant as the backbone of his
    family and the impact that his removal would have on the  children  and
    his wife.  Mr NA stated that the appellant  was  now  a  well-respected
    member of the community whose contribution  over  the  years  has  seen
    'countless of young people['s] lives transformed' and 'He fills a vital
    role as a  community  practitioner'  and  undertakes  volunteering  and
    community work.  Mr NA  is  the  chairman  of  such  a  community-based
    organisation and attested to the numerous good work with  young  people
    that the appellant had  fulfilled.  Indeed,  there  is  a  letter  from
    Stephen Doughty MP confirming that the appellant works as  a  volunteer
    for a charity for the homeless in Cardiff.

40. The appellant works for British Gas as a Customer Services Team  Leader
    and specifically  works  late  shifts  and  at  weekends  in  order  to
    undertake a caring role for his children. The  evidence  recorded  that
    the appellant's mother was killed in Somalia when he  was  eight  years
    old and his father 'not attached and unemotional  with  his  children'.
    The appellant's own desire was to be 'a good father, a role model  that
    [his children] can look up to and come to, I want my sons to look at us
    both and see we are being educated and want to do the same themselves'.
    [6.7] Harris report.

41. Mrs I, the appellant's wife,  attested  to  the  devastation  that  the
    removal of the appellant would have on her life because  the  appellant
    was a committed father and so involved with the day-to-day care of  the
    children.  She  reported  this  to  Mrs  Harris  and  because  of   her
    consistency I find her wholly credible and that she 'would not be  able
    to cope without [K]' in her life and  that  he  was  engaged  in  every
    aspect of their life'.  She added 'it would devastate our  children  if
    [K] was no longer in their lives'.  I can only conclude that the mother
    of her own children would be in the best position to know what would or
    would not devastate her children.

42. With regards Section 117  the  appellant  was  in  the  United  Kingdom
    lawfully and with Indefinite Leave  to  Remain  until  the  deportation
    order was made.  I should also note that he was first introduced to his
    wife in 2011 prior to the Deportation Order.   In  other  words,  their
    relationship commenced at a time when he was here with settled  status.
     There  is  no  doubt  the  appellant  speaks  fluent  English  and  is
    financially  independent  although  that  is  not  the  focus   of   my
    deliberations.

43. The deterrent effect of deportation and the public  confidence  in  the
    system, is not to be under estimated or  undermined  and  Section  117C
    underlines the powerful public interest considerations in play.   There
    can be no doubt that the appellant committed a serious offence  in  the
    supply of Class A drugs and is the subject of an automatic deportation.
    However, I have considered whether his  separation  from  the  children
    will in the circumstances be  'unduly  harsh'  and  also  if  they  are
    'inordinately' or 'excessively' harsh taking into account  all  of  the
    circumstances in relation to the children.

44. As set out above the appellant has placed himself both in the community
    and for his own children as a role model. Mr A, a  Community  Organiser
    with Citizens Cymru Wales endorsed his work with this commendation, not
    least that his involvement which steers

         'young people away from crime and anti-social behaviour'  and  that
         'his desire to help young people is remarkable and the changes  are
         visible with many finding work or going back into education'.

45. Indeed, there were numerous character references from community members
    attesting to the appellant's good nature and works.

46. I conclude  on  the  evidence  before  me  that  the  impact  on  these
    particular children of their father's removal, not least because of his
    instrumental primary caring role, would indeed be bleak.  The father is
    a primary carer for the children during the week and the separation for
    the children  would  be  intense.   The  children  are  evidently  very
    attached to their father.  The mother would not be caring for just  one
    child but two and this would have a further  effect  on  the  children.
    The appellant is a father figure and a role model for them  and  he  is
    only too aware of the problems of offending and  has  with  effort  and
    success which has been attested to, attempted to rectify  this  in  the
    community with young people. He clearly, and I accept  sincerely,  does
    not wish his own children to follow the same  path.   Cumulatively  the
    effects of removal on the children will, I accept, be not  only  severe
    and harsh but further unduly harsh.

47. I have not ignored the public interest in deportation and am  alive  to
    Section 117C which holds that

         (1)      The deportation of foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)      The more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
         criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of  the
         criminal.

48. As set out in AM, deportation

         'has the effect not only of removing the risk  of  re-offending  by
         the deportee himself, but also of deterring other foreign nationals
         in  a  similar  position.  Furthermore,  deportation   of   foreign
         criminals preserves public confidence in a system of control  whose
         loss would itself tend towards crime and disorder'.

    I am aware of  the  exacting  test  to  be  applied  and  have  weighed
    throughout the consequences of deportation against the full  import  of
    the legitimate aim being relied upon  which  is  the  need  to  prevent
    disorder and crime and the protection  of  health  and  morals;  to  be
    achieved. I do not consider one piece of the evidence with  regard  the
    children is determinative but cumulatively I do so find that the effect
    on the children  would  be  unduly  harsh.  In  my  view,  however,  an
    evaluation  of  all  the  particular  circumstances,  and  strands   of
    evidence, when focussing on and relating to the effect on the children,
    in accordance with the reasoning in  KO  (Nigeria),  would  involve  an
    unduly harsh effect should the children be expected to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom without the appellant.

49. I therefore allow the appeal.
