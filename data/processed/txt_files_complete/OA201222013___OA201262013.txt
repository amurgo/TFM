                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms L Dickinson of Fursdon Knapper Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer appeals against the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Britton) allowing the appeals of Shaleen  Jakobsen
    and her  son  Elek  Churella  against  refusals  to  grant  them  entry
    clearance under para EC-C of Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  (HC
    395 as amended).

 2. For convenience, I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellants are citizens of the United States of America.  The first
    appellant is the mother of the second  appellant  and  they  were  born
    respectively on 23 April 1978 and 6 January 2000.

 4. The first appellant sought entry clearance as the fianc�e of a  British
    citizen, Mr Paul Bittle who is a British citizen  born  on  10  January
    1969.  The second appellant  sought  entry  as  the  first  appellant's
    dependent child.

 5. The first appellant met the sponsor over the internet in November 2012.
     They established a relationship.  The first appellant travelled to the
    United Kingdom with her son on 7 March 2013 and stayed with the sponsor
    and his son, Cole who is aged 13 for ten days.  During  that  time  the
    appellants met the sponsor's family in the UK.

 6. The relationship of the appellant and sponsor developed such that  they
    decided to marry.  On 4 October 2013, the first appellant  applied  for
    entry clearance as a fianc�e together with the second appellant as  her
    dependent child.

 7. Following an interview, on 23 October 2013, the Entry Clearance Officer
    refused each appellant entry clearance.

 8. In respect of the first appellant, the ECO accepted that the  appellant
    met all of the requirements of E-ECP of  Appendix  FM  (as  a  partner)
    apart from two.  First, on the basis that the appellant and sponsor had
    not made any arrangements for their marriage when the  first  appellant
    came to the UK, the ECO was not satisfied that she was  "seeking  entry
    to the UK to enable their  marriage  ...  to  take  place"  (E-ECP2.8).
    Secondly, on the basis of  a  number  of  convictions  that  the  first
    appellant had in the USA the ECO  was  not  satisfied  that  the  first
    appellant met  the  suitability  requirement  in  S-EC2.5  because  her
    exclusion was "conducive to the public good".

 9. The second appellant's application fell to be refused in line with  the
    ECO's decision in respect of the first appellant.

The Appeals to the First-tier Tribunal

10. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

11. Before their appeals were heard, the Entry Clearance  Manager  reviewed
    the ECO's decisions and, on 2  January  2014,  whilst  maintaining  the
    refusals conceded the suitability requirement in S-EC2.5.

12. Thus, when the appeal came before Judge Britton the  only  issue  under
    Appendix FM was the requirement in E-ECP2.8 that:

         "If the applicant is a fianc�(e) ... they must be seeking entry  to
         the UK to enable their marriage ... to take place."

13. The judge had a  bundle  of  documents  which  were  submitted  by  the
    appellants including a witness statement from the first appellant dated
    16 June 2014 (at pages 1-6 of the bundle)  and  a  statement  from  the
    sponsor dated 16 June 2014 (at pages 7-10 of the bundle).   There  were
    also a number of supporting letters from the sponsor's parents,  family
    and friends (at pages 11-19 of the bundle).  In addition,  there  is  a
    letter from Danielle Peaks dated 20 May 2014 stating that she sold  the
    first appellant a Vera Wang wedding dress in August 2013.  In addition,
    the sponsor gave oral evidence before the judge.

14. In addition to the evidence concerning the appellants' visit to the  UK
    in March 2013, both the first appellant and sponsor gave evidence  that
    the sponsor and his son, Cole had travelled  to  America  in  order  to
    visit the appellants and had stayed from 27 December 2013 to 8  January
    2014 and again the sponsor had visited the appellant from 18 April 2014
    until 27 April 2014.

15. The evidence before the  judge  was  that  the  sponsor  and  appellant
    intended to marry on 25 October 2014 at Plymouth Registry Office with a
    reception at the Weston Mill Bank Social Club.  Both  of  those  venues
    had been booked.

16.  The  sponsor  gave  evidence  that  they  had  previously   not   made
    arrangements for their wedding as they did  not  want  to  put  down  a
    deposit and would make plans for their wedding when the first appellant
    came to the UK.  It was accepted that the appellant and sponsor had not
    booked any wedding arrangements prior to the ECO's decision.

17. At paras 15-17 Judge Britton considered the issue  of  whether  it  was
    established on a balance of probabilities that the first appellant  was
    seeking entry in order to marry the  sponsor  during  the  six  months'
    leave she would be granted as a fianc�e.  The judge said this:

         "15. ... At the time of the applications the  first  appellant  had
             not made arrangements to fix a date or place of the wedding as
             she wanted to make  the  arrangements  when  she  was  in  the
             country.  They did not waste money on paying a  deposit  until
             they had decided exactly the date of the wedding and  lace  of
             the reception.

         16.  They have had to scale down their wedding plans because of the
             costs involved.  They now have  a  date  of  the  wedding,  25
             October 2014 at 12.45pm, and they will be married at  Plymouth
             Registry Office.  They have also booked  the  reception.   The
             first appellant  has  also  produced  evidence  that  she  has
             purchased a wedding dress.

         17.  I am satisfied that the first appellant and sponsor intend  to
             marry and live permanently together in the UK.  However,  what
             was missing was evidence of when and where their  wedding  was
             to take place.  The  first  appellant  and  sponsor  have  now
             produced such evidence, and the  first  and  second  appellant
             meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules."

18. As a result, the  judge  allowed  the  appellants'  appeals  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

19. The ECO sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the  basis
    that the judge had erred in law in taking into account evidence of  the
    parties' marriage arrangements which postdated  both  the  applications
    and the ECO's decisions.

20. On 8 October 2014, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Brunnen) granted  the
    ECO permission to appeal on that ground.  Thus, the appeals came before
    me.

Discussion

21. Mr Richards, on behalf of the Secretary of State acknowledged that  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  had  granted  permission  to  appeal  with   some
    reluctance  and  had  expressly  invited  the  ECO  to  reconsider  the
    decisions.  Nevertheless,  Mr  Richards  maintains  that  there  was  a
    material error of law in the determination on the basis set out in  the
    grounds.  The judge had failed to focus on  the  date  of  decision  by
    taking into account post-decision events, namely that the  parties  had
    subsequent to the decisions made arrangements for their wedding in  the
    UK.

22. Having made that submission, Mr Richards invited me to find  there  was
    an error of law and briefly to take evidence from the sponsor in  order
    to remake the decision.  He did not seek to press the point that on the
    evidence before me the appellant had not established the requirement in
    E-ECP2.8.

23. On behalf of the appellants, Ms  Dickinson  submitted  that  there  was
    documentary evidence in the bundle which supported the judge's  finding
    that the first appellant was  seeking  entry  in  order  to  marry  the
    sponsor during  the  six  months'  leave  she  would  be  granted.   Ms
    Dickinson accepted that the judge was wrong to take into account  post-
    decision events in paragraph 17 of his determination but, in the  light
    of the other evidence, any error was immaterial.

24. Having heard the submissions,  I  invited  Ms  Dickinson  to  call  the
    sponsor to give oral evidence.  He did so briefly.  The sponsor adopted
    his statement of 6 June 2014.  In his  evidence-in-chief,  the  sponsor
    said that if the first appellant had been granted a visa they wanted to
    get married as quickly as possible.  They had  not  made  any  concrete
    plans as they did not know how long the visa was going to take.  It was
    their intention to live together and get married as  soon  as  possible
    when the first appellant came to the UK.

25. In cross-examination, Mr Richards asked one question:  he  invited  the
    sponsor to say whether there was  anything  wrong  with  the  following
    statement, namely that at the time the  appellants  applied  for  entry
    clearance it was the first appellant's intention to marry  the  sponsor
    in the UK; that was also her intention at the  date  of  decision  even
    though no arrangements had been made.  The sponsor confirmed that  that
    was correct.

26. As these  appeals  are  against  decisions  refusing  entry  clearance,
    s.85A(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  applies
    such that:

         "The Tribunal may consider only the circumstances  appertaining  at
         the time of decision."

27. By contrast, where that provision does not apply, by virtue of s.85(4),
    the Tribunal may:

         "consider evidence about any matter which it thinks relevant to the
         substance of the decision,  including  evidence  which  concerns  a
         matter arising after the date of the decision."

28. Nothing in s.85A(2) prohibits consideration of evidence  that  was  not
    before the ECO and was "evidence arising" after the  date  of  decision
    (see  DR*  [2005]  UKIAT  00038).   Subsequently   obtained   evidence,
    including evidence of post-decision  events,  is  admissible  providing
    that it relates to "circumstances  appertaining  at  the  time  of  the
    decision".  As the IAT pointed out in DR, it  is  on  that  basis  that
    evidence of "intervening devotion" between the  date  of  decision  and
    hearing is admissible as it reflects on the intention of the parties in
    a marriage case at the date of decision.

29. I did not understand Ms Dickenson to submit that the judge was entitled
    to take into account in this appeal the the post-decision  evidence  of
    post-decision events, namely the marriage  arrangement  in  reaching  a
    finding on whether the first appellant had established that at the date
    of decision it was her intention to marry the sponsor  during  her  six
    months' leave in the UK.  She submitted, however, any  such  error  was
    not material given the other evidence before the judge.

30. There was indeed evidence before the judge that the parties intended to
    marry  when  the  first  appellant  came  to  the  UK  even  though  no
    arrangements had been made.   There  was  the  evidence  of  the  first
    appellant and sponsor in their witness statements and the  evidence  of
    the sponsor given orally.  In addition, there was the evidence that the
    first appellant had  purchased  a  wedding  dress  in  August  2013  in
    America.

31. I have no doubt that it was open to the judge  on  the  basis  of  this
    evidence to find that the first appellant had established on a  balance
    of probabilities that she intended to  marry  the  sponsor  in  the  UK
    during her  visit.   The  judge  cast  no  doubt  on  the  veracity  or
    credibility of any of  the  evidence.   His  reasoning  does,  however,
    appear to reflect that the post-decision evidence that the parties  had
    made marriage  arrangements  tipped  the  balance  in  the  appellants'
    favour.

32. In the light of that, I accept that the judge materially erred  in  law
    in reaching his finding in respect of E-ECP2.8.  The  decision  is  set
    aside.

33. As a result, I must remake the decision.  The evidence in these appeals
    points only in one direction.  The  witness  statements  of  the  first
    appellant and sponsor make clear that the only reason they had not made
    arrangements for their  marriage  before  the  ECO's  decisions  was  a
    practical one.  The sponsor reiterated that point in his oral  evidence
    before me.  That evidence was not challenged and I accept it. The first
    appellant purchased a wedding dress in the USA before  she  planned  to
    travel.

34. In addition, in response to the single question put to the  sponsor  in
    cross-examination, he confirmed that it had been the first  appellant's
    intention to marry him when she came to the UK  both  at  the  time  of
    making the application for entry clearance and at the time of the ECO's
    decision.  Mr Richards did not seek to challenge that answer  given  in
    cross-examination.

35. I accept the evidence before  me.   It  establishes  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities that at the date of  applications  and  at  the  date  of
    decision the intention of the first appellant was to marry the  sponsor
    during the six month period that  she  would  be  granted  leave  as  a
    fianc�e under Appendix FM.

36. I am satisfied, therefore, that at  the  date  of  decision  the  first
    appellant met the requirement in E-ECP2.8.  It  is  accepted  that  the
    first appellant met all the remaining requirements of Appendix  FM  for
    entry clearance as a fianc�e.

37. Consequently, I am satisfied that the first appellant  is  entitled  to
    entry clearance under Appendix FM and, in line with  that,  the  second
    appellant as her dependent child is also entitled to entry clearance.


Decision

38. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow  the  appellants'
    appeals involved the making of a material error of law.   I  set  those
    decisions aside.

39. I remake the decisions allowing the appeals of  the  first  and  second
    appellants under the Immigration Rules, namely E-ECP of appendix FM and
    EC-C of Appendix FM respectively.

                                                                      Signed

                                                                     A Grubb

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Judge Britton declined to make  a  fee  award  as  the  appellants  had  not
produced satisfactory evidence to the Entry Clearance Officer  at  the  time
of their applications.

I agree and for those reasons I too do not make a fee award.
                                                                      Signed
