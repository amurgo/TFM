                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr M Chatwin (counsel instructed by  Lawrence Lupin) for Mr Haxhiu [H]
Mr P Farrell (solicitor, Glasgow) for Mr Qeleposhi [Q]
Miss D Prentice for the respondent

  These are appeals from decisions of adjudicators (Miss ME Lewis,  sitting
  at Croydon; and Mr F  Pieri,  sitting  at  Glasgow,  both  on  12  June),
  dismissing asylum and human rights appeals by Albanian  citizens  of  the
  Pre?evo valley in Serbia, from removal directions as illegal entrants, on
  8 September and 25 August 2001. Leave was given on the basis  that  there
  were conflicting decisions of the Tribunal which needed to  be  resolved.
  Whether that is in fact the case we shall have to consider: whatever view
  we take on that, our concern is with whether either appellant  would  now
  face any real risk on return in the present state of affairs  in  Pre?evo
  valley. As the assessment of that is the main issue  in,  and  common  to
  both cases, we heard them together.


2. H gave  his  former  address  as  (apparently)  a  village  near  Pre?evo
  (Presheve in Albanian); Q a street in the town itself. H left after being
  stabbed by Serb police in December 1999: it is  not  clear  what  brought
  things to a head then, but he says they had been accusing him of being an
  Albanian nationalist, over a period of time. Q  was  driven  out  by  the
  Serbs for refusing to collaborate with them  in  December  2000.  Neither
  adjudicator had any significant  reservations  about  either  appellant's
  credibility, and we are prepared to accept that what happened to each  of
  them amounted to Refugee Convention persecution when it  happened,  given
  the then rï¿½gime in Serbia.

3. Mr Chatwin's case for H was that, while there is now no general  lack  of
  protection for Albanians in Pre?evo, the seriousness of what happened  to
  him leaves concerns on that score capable of amounting to a real risk  on
  return. Mr Farrell for Q on the other hand did not make  that  concession
  about the general state of affairs, but asked us to consider whether  the
  risks seen by the Tribunal in the earlier cases before us still persist.

4. The first of  those  cases  was  Gjemali  [01/TH/02883],  a  decision  of
  Professor DC Jackson and a lay panel, by a majority, sitting on 9 October
  2001. The next was Caushi: not [01/TH/01411], a decision on Kosovo,  with
  which Mr Farrell had provided us, no doubt because he had failed to  give
  the citations in his own grounds of appeal; but [2002] UKIAT 00393, which
  we found for ourselves and distributed to everyone. This was  a  decision
  of Mackey VP and a lay panel, sitting on 25 January 2002. Meanwhile there
  had been Osmani [2002] UKIAT 00136, decided by Fox VP,  sitting  with  Mr
  MSW Hoyle on 2 January: we shall come back to that in due course.

5. The Tribunal in Gjemali had before them the CIPU report  of  March  2001,
  with a bulletin of 3 July that  year;  the  others  apparently  the  CIPU
  report of the following October. There is no mention of any specific Home
  Office bulletin in Caushi; however in Osmani they also had one whose date
  they do not mention, but apparently the  forerunner  of  the  one  of  16
  September 2002, before us with attached  letters  from  the  Foreign  and
  Commonwealth Office and UNHCR: we have the CIPU report of October 2002.

6. The ratio of the majority in Gjemali appears as follows:

  22. It is arguable that the risk of persecution in  this  case  is  by  a
  State agency, the police or local  authority.  It  is  far  more  likely,
  however, that the persecution would be through the actions and  attitudes
  of non-state agents. In that context the question arises  as  to  whether
  there would be a sufficiency of protection. It will be apparent from  the
  majority view of the facts that we do not believe, given the  history  of
  the area of the Presevo Valley, that that has been established.  We  have
  little doubt that in time it may be established. However, the elements of
  the National Plan make it clear that certain fundamental issues  such  as
  the participation of ethnic Albanians  in  government  and  business  are
  being addressed. Central to this case, however, as we have said,  is  the
  creation of a multi-ethnic police force and the lack  of  consistency  of
  the need for such a force and the view of  the  CIPU  Bulletin  that  any
  harassment suffered by ethnic Albanians could be countered by  protection
  from the police. In our view, therefore, approaching the present  in  the
  light of  the  past,  the  evidence  does  not  establish  the  necessary
  sufficiency of protection.


7. This was the ratio of the Tribunal in Caushi:

  20. In reaching our conclusions in relation to Issue  (a)  we  have  been
  guided by the decision of Court of  Appeal  in  Demikaya  and  have  thus
  carefully considered whether there has been,  in  the  Preshevo  area  in
  Serbia, "a  major  change  in  circumstances...  that  makes  prospective
  persecution unlikely." We have noted individualised past  persecution  in
  relation to this appellant and his family. The country information, as is
  set down in the CIPU assessment of October 2001  and  in  order  reports,
  definitely indicates an improving situation in Southern Serbia.  However,
  against this must be balanced comments also made in various reports which
  counsel has aptly termed a "blueprint for  change".  Country  information
  indicates continuing risks to  ethnic  Serbs  and  the  possibility  that
  serious crimes could reoccur. We find that the conclusions on this  issue
  reached by the Adjudicator that the likelihood of future  persecution  is
  reduced by the measures in place were insufficient and he did not  go  on
  to consider whether there was a real risk for this appellant on return.


  21. After carefully  balancing  the  country  information,  and  all  the
  evidence before us we consider, possibly extending  the  benefit  of  the
  doubt, that there has not yet been a major change in circumstances to the
  extent that any prospective fear of persecution by Serb groups,  such  as
  those that attacked this appellant and his family in  December  2000,  is
  below the level of a real  risk  nor  that  there  is  a  sufficiency  of
  protection yet available by the Serbian authorities.


  They go on to indicate that they reached  this  conclusion  "possibly  at
  this stage only by a small margin".


8. The Tribunal in Osmani on the  other  hand  reviewed  the  progress  made
  since the (Albanian separatist) UCPMB guerrillas accepted an  amnesty  in
  May 2001, the giving and progressive implementation  of  undertakings  by
  the Serb authorities since, including the establishment of a multi-ethnic
  police force. They based their decision on the Home Office report  before
  them, summarized as follows:

  25. The report notes that the positive developments in the  Presevo  area
  have been hailed by the international community as a  great  success  for
  the Serb administrator and the local ethnic Albanian leaders.

  26. It does state that there is a potential  for  conflict  to  flare  up
  again. However, that is balanced by the willingness  of  all  parties  to
  engage in negotiation and the Serb authorities' commitment to  addressing
  the needs of the local population mark a radical change of  approach  and
  give cause  for  optimism.  This  concludes  that  ethnic  Albanians  are
  unlikely to be at risk of persecution from the Serb  authorities  in  the
  current circumstances. It notes that it is possible  that  there  may  be
  some resentment towards ethnic Albanians among the local Serb  civilians.
  However, ethnic Albanians are in the great majority in the  Presevo  area
  and do not suffer any incidents of harassment or  intimidation  and  they
  would have adequate redress with the local police force.

9. The view of the Tribunal in Gjemali, sitting only a few months after  the
  amnesty and at a time when the necessary changes were only getting  under
  way, took a view on the effectiveness of protection in Pre?evo which  may
  be summarized as "not yet, but with little doubt in time".  The  Tribunal
  in Caushi said in effect "not yet, with the benefit  of  the  doubt,  and
  possibly by this stage only by a small margin". We are not concerned with
  whether they were right or wrong on the facts as they saw them when  they
  sat;  but  with  whether  they  indicate  any  reasonable  likelihood  of
  continuing failure of protection now. As Mr Chatwin conceded, Osmani  has
  represented the continuing positive view of the Tribunal to date.

10. Mr Farrell did not refer us to any  further  official  material,  beyond
  those cases and what the Home Office had put in (referred to at 5 above):
  he did put two Internet items before us, to which  we  shall  return.  Mr
  Chatwin put in the Amnesty International and State Department reports for
  2001, as well as a press release  of  11  July  2002,  announcing  a  new
  "briefing paper" from Human Rights Watch; but the passages  to  which  he
  referred us relate to Serbia generally, and what is said to be continuing
  impunity for past war crimes there. As he conceded, the police  force  in
  Pre?evo in particular has been  the  subject  of  specific  international
  attention. There is said (at ï¿½ 6.33 of the CIPU report) to be a new right-
  wing group in Serbia called OBRAZ, which is suspected of violence towards
  minorities; but there is nothing to suggest it is active in Pre?evo.  The
  passage on Pre?evo in the Human Rights Watch report for 2001 (at  p  4/13
  of the copy before us), which appears in H's bundle, refers  to  positive
  steps taken by the Belgrade authorities, and a general return  to  normal
  (including the homecoming of  4,000  out  of  15,000  Albanian  displaced
  persons) even as of May - July that year.

11. At ï¿½ 6.59 of the current (October 2002) CIPU report, immediately  before
  the passage quoted in Osmani at ï¿½ 25, we noted the following sentence:

   Although they have expressed unease about the continued presence  of  163
   policemen whom they claim served in the  Kosovo  war,  the  multi  ethnic
   police force  has  received  wide  approval  among  the  ethnic  Albanian
   population.

   We put that passage to Mr Chatwin, who could do no more than  repeat  his
   general submission, that there had as yet been no complete change. As  he
   pointed out, H's fear had been of two specific officers. Apart  from  the
   material about Serbia generally, to which we have  already  referred,  he
   could put  forward  no  reason  why  any  repetition  of  their  previous
   behaviour towards H should be tolerated by the Pre?evo authorities in the
   present climate.

12. Mr Farrell's Internet items do not show any date of origin, but only  11
  November 2002  as  the  date  of  downloading.  Both  come  from  a  site
  www.presheva.com, about which  we  can  tell  no  more  than  that  their
  Albanian language shows they originate from that community. One is headed
  "An Albanian is physically attacked and severely  insulted  at  a  police
  checkout in the village of Mucibaba": it  gives  Radio  Presheva  as  the
  source. There is no date for the incident. Mr Farrell referred us to  the
  last  paragraph,  about  returning  displaced  persons  being   regularly
  harassed by border police, as well as police patrols along the road.

13. The other item is headed "Nagipi Arifi requests  international  pressure
  for a reduction of police forces". The translated text contains  no  date
  at all; but, though none of us reads  Albanian,  we  could  not  fail  to
  notice that the original does include, twice, the date of "21 maj  2001".
  While that is no doubt the well-known date  of  the  UCPMB  amnesty,  its
  omission to say  the  least  does  nothing  for  our  confidence  in  the
  translators (Global Language Services Limited) who  should  not  be  used
  again by any practitioners in this field. Another, minor  point  is  that
  the name of the subject, as shown by the original, is Nagip Arifi: he  is
  described as  the  first  Albanian  prefect  of  Bujanovc  [Bujanovac  in
  Serbian], and is clearly a senior administrator in  the  area.  He  notes
  complaints that

   In the villages along the Kosovan border in the  Presheva  region,  there
   are still a high number  of  police  forces  and  special  units  of  the
   Yugoslav army, which are frightening the local residents

   He expresses the wish, to which he  says  the  government  [no  doubt  in
   Belgrade] has not responded, that these forces should be withdrawn.

14. Conclusions  Mr Farrell's client (Q) comes from Pre?evo itself, and  not
  the Kosovo border area at all; nor did Mr Chatwin  suggest  that  H  came
  from that area. UNHCR in their letter of 5  September  (attached  to  the
  Home Office bulletin referred to at 5 above) express the  view  of  their
  Belgrade  office  that,  given  proper  arrangements,  including   travel
  documents, "... individuals from Pre?evo being returned through  Belgrade
  should not face any undue  hardships",  though  such  returns  should  be
  implemented with caution: as the Home  Office  note  in  their  bulletin,
  there are political reasons for not returning  such  persons  by  way  of
  Kosovo, and it is clear that this route will not be used.

15. There is nothing to show that the police on the border  (so  far  as  it
  can be called one) between Serbia proper and Pre?evo present any kind  of
  a risk, nor that either of these appellants would  have  to  go  anywhere
  near the Kosovo border. We do not see any real risk on  return  from  the
  border police in either of these cases; nor is it clear  that  appellants
  who came from near the Kosovo border, but would not  be  returned  across
  it, would be at any real risk either. Future cases involving such persons
  would have to be decided on  their  own  facts  (including  any  internal
  flight alternative), and we hope  rather  more  reliably  translated  and
  sourced information than the Internet reports before us.

16. So far as the general level of protection in Pre?evo  is  concerned,  it
  is clear from the passage quoted at 11 above that the  majority  Albanian
  population [see CIPU report ï¿½  6.49]  have  given  the  new  multi-ethnic
  police force  their  vote  of  confidence,  though  they  have  the  same
  reservations as apparently do people elsewhere in Serbia about those  who
  served in the Kosovo war. They  also  gave  their  approval  to  the  new
  dispensation following the  May  2001  amnesty,  by  returning  in  large
  numbers within the next few months [see 10]. We have no doubt  whatsoever
  that Mr Chatwin was entirely right in making the concession he did. While
  he did the best he could  for  H  in  referring  us  to  all  conceivably
  relevant material, and in emphasizing the  serious  nature  of  what  had
  happened to him in December 1999, we have no doubt that H would now  face
  no real risk on return of any kind. The climate which allowed the  police
  to  stab  him  with  impunity  back  then  has  clearly  changed   beyond
  recognition.

17. As for Q, the incident of which he complains was less serious, and  also
  happened before the changes. We do not think Mr  Farrell  greatly  helped
  his case by referring us to decisions from a  time  when  the  effect  of
  those changes had not become so apparent as it now is; but at least  that
  has enabled us to lay those decisions firmly to rest. Gjemali and  Caushi
  should no longer be cited as  any  guide  to  the  current  situation  in
  Pre?evo; so long as things there go on their present course, the evidence
  we have reviewed for ourselves shows that the approach in Osmani  is  the
  one to be followed.

Appeals dismissed
