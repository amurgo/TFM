                            DECISION AND REASONS



1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal issued on 20 May 2016 allowing  an  appeal  by  the
    applicant  against  the  decision  of  19  August  2015  refusing   his
    application for asylum.  In this decision I will refer to  the  parties
    as they were before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  applicant  as  the
    appellant and the Secretary of State as the respondent.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan, born on 1 January 1998.   He
    arrived in the UK on 1 June 2010, claiming asylum the  same  day.   His
    application  was  refused  on  13  August  2010  but  he  was   granted
    discretionary leave to remain until  11  August  2013.   He  lodged  an
    appeal against the asylum decision but later withdrew his  appeal.   He
    submitted a further application for leave to remain on 2  August  2013.
    He claimed that he would still be at risk of harm if he had  to  return
    to Afghanistan but it  was  the  respondent's  view  that  he  had  not
    provided  any  evidence  to  substantiate  this  claim.  His  fears  of
    returning to Afghanistan had been  fully  considered  in  his  previous
    application where his claim was rejected.  The respondent  went  on  to
    consider the claim based on his family and private life in the  UK  but
    was not satisfied that he could meet the requirements of the  Rules  or
    that there were any exceptional circumstances  which  might  warrant  a
    grant of leave to remain outside the Rules.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

3.   At the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  appellant  gave  a
    number of reasons why he was afraid of returning to Afghanistan. He had
    enemies who would find and kill him; he would be at risk because of the
    war and conflict; there had been a  feud  between  his  uncle  and  the
    enemies who wanted to finish off all the  family  and  he  also  feared
    ISIS.  He said that his home was about three hours from  Kabul  but  he
    would be recognised there because he had returned from the UK  and  was
    on Facebook.  He was also waiting for a reply from the  Red  Cross  who
    had so far been unsuccessful in tracing his family in Afghanistan.

4.   It was submitted on his behalf that he  would  be  at  risk  on  return
    because of his fear of the Taliban and his perceived  support  for  the
    government and international forces based on his prolonged absence  and
    his links to the UK.  He was a member of a particular social  group  as
    the victim of a family feud and as a young lone male.  His  family  had
    been specifically targeted.  He had actively sought to locate them.  He
    could not return to Baghlan province because of the risk to  him  there
    and the lack of family support.  It  was  further  submitted  that  the
    respondent's failure to discharge her duty to endeavour  to  trace  and
    the delay in making the decision amounted to compelling or  exceptional
    circumstances warranting further consideration under article 8.

5.   On behalf of the respondent, it  was  argued  that  the  appellant  had
    provided no evidence to substantiate his claim that he would be at risk
    on return to Afghanistan.  He no longer required leave to remain in the
    UK as an unaccompanied asylum seeking child as he was  over  17ï¿½.   The
    delay in deciding the application could not be regarded as a compelling
    reason to justify a grant of leave outside  the  Rules.   Even  if  the
    appellant could not return to his home area, he could relocate to Kabul
    and start afresh.  He had been living independently in the UK  and  his
    social worker said that he could look after himself.

6.    The  judge  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant   had   provided
    sufficiently strong evidence to indicate that the situation had changed
    from when his original asylum application was refused.   There  was  no
    sufficient evidence that he would be at risk on return six years  later
    from those he had called his enemies.  She then considered whether  the
    appellant would be at risk on return as he was only just 18,  would  be
    returning on his own and would have no family to engage with whether in
    his home area or in Kabul [36].  The appellant had  said  that  he  had
    tried to trace his family members via  the  Red  Cross  and  the  judge
    accepted  that  this  was  the  case.   The  judge   referred   to   HK
    (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State [2012] EWCA Civ 315 where the  Court
    of Appeal had held that it was  not  necessarily  appropriate  to  draw
    adverse inferences that a child would be received safely merely from  a
    failure to try and contact his or her family.  This would depend  on  a
    range of factors including the age and circumstances of the child.

7.   The judge said that in her view the appellant had given a credible  and
    co-operative account of  having  lost  touch  with  family  members  in
    Afghanistan.  He had approached the Red Cross to seek to trace them and
    had asked his father's cousin to attempt  to  do  so  when  he  was  in
    Afghanistan but this was unsuccessful.   The  appellant  had  therefore
    done all that could reasonably be expected of him.

8.   The judge set out her conclusions on this issue as follows:

         "43. In EU and Others [2013] EWCA Civ  32  it  was  held  that  the
             respondent did not discharge  her  duty  to  trace  merely  by
             informing a child of the facilities of the Red Cross.  She had
             failed to discharge the  duty  in  relation  to  unaccompanied
             minors from Afghanistan because  she  adopted  the  policy  of
             granting them leave to remain until they reached  the  age  of
             seventeen and a half, whereafter any further application would
             be considered on its merits.  By that  time,  of  course,  the
             duty to endeavour  to  trace  would  be  close  to  expiration
             because of the imminence of majority.

         44.  In EU and Others [2013] EWCA Civ  32  it  was  held  that  the
             assessment of risk of return was not subject to a bright  line
             rule, under which risk may be  considered  to  be  necessarily
             reduced or to have ceased on a claimant's actual  or  assessed
             eighteenth birthday.

         45.  The Appellant would for the above reasons, as an 18  year  old
             who has lived in the UK all through  his  adolescence,  be  at
             risk on return to Afghanistan.

         46.  I allow the appeal on asylum grounds."

9.   The judge went on to consider article 8 finding  that  the  appellant's
    private life was amply demonstrated by the  cumulative  effect  of  his
    friendship with  his  former  foster  carers,  his  education  and  his
    sporting activities.  When assessing proportionality,  the  judge  took
    into account the loss of his involvement in these activities, the delay
    by the respondent in reaching a decision, commenting that  leaving  the
    appellant in limbo between the ages of 15  and  17  was  a  significant
    matter.  He had come to the UK at the age of 12 and  his  growing  into
    adulthood had been done in the UK, in the UK  context  and  in  the  UK
    culture.  She also noted the letters of support  from  the  appellant's
    foster worker, social workers and school and the fact that  his  former
    social worker had taken the trouble to attend  the  hearing  as  had  a
    former foster mother.  The appeal was therefore also allowed on article
    8 grounds.

The Grounds and Submissions

10   In the respondent's grounds it  is  argued  that  the  judge  erred  in
    finding that the appellant would be at risk on  return  due  to  having
    only just turned 18, returning on his own and having no family and that
    he would be at risk of persecution  for  a  Convention  reason.  It  is
    further argued  that  when  considering  article  8  the  judge  failed
    properly to consider the  provisions  of  s.117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Little weight should have been  given
    to private life established when an appellant's immigration status  was
    precarious or unlawful: AM (s.117B) Malawi  [2015]  UKUT  260  and  the
    judge's consideration of s.117B did not demonstrate that the  statutory
    requirements had been given full effect.

11.  In the Rule 24 response it is argued that the judge allowed the  appeal
    on the basis that the appellant was an unaccompanied returnee  who  had
    only just turned 18 years  of  age  following  a  prolonged  period  of
    absence from Afghanistan.  She  had  had  regard  to  KA  (Afghanistan)
    [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1014  and  EU  (Afghanistan)  and  to  the   country
    information in the objective bundle  and  the  report  of  the  country
    expert, Dr David Seddon.  The judge had  fully  taken  account  of  the
    provisions of s.117B and was alive to the fact that the appellant was a
    student and that it was evident that he spoke English.  The  judge  had
    been entitled to take into account all factors relevant to  the  public
    interest such as the delay in the decision-making process, the  failure
    to trace and the appellant's roots established in the UK over a  period
    of six years.

Assessment of whether the Judge erred in law

12.  I must consider is whether  the  judge  erred  in  law  such  that  the
    decision should be set aside.  When considering the asylum  appeal  the
    judge was not satisfied that the appellant had established even to  the
    lower standard of proof that he would be at  risk  from  those  he  had
    identified as his enemies such as the  Taliban  in  the  light  of  his
    perceived support for the government and international forces or  as  a
    victim of a family feud.  The basis on  which  the  judge  allowed  the
    appeal was that, although the appellant was technically  an  adult,  he
    was only just 18, would be returning on his own and with no  family  to
    engage with whether in his home area or Kabul.  The judge noted in [41]
    KA v Secretary of State which considered the consequences of failure by
    the respondent to discharge the duty to endeavour to trace the  members
    of a minor's family.

13.  The Court of Appeal recognised that a failure  to  discharge  the  duty
    may be relevant to the  consideration  of  an  asylum  or  humanitarian
    protection claim and indicated that an appellant who had  no  surviving
    family in Afghanistan, or  having  lost  touch  with  surviving  family
    members had failed, notwithstanding his best endeavours to re-establish
    contact, may, even if he had reached the age of 18,  and  depending  on
    the totality of established facts,  have  the  basis  of  a  successful
    appeal by availing himself of the Rashid  principle by reference to the
    failure of the Secretary of State to discharge the duty to endeavour to
    trace.

14.  However, the judge's attention does not appear to have  been  drawn  to
    the Supreme Court judgment in TM and MA (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2015] UKSC 40 where the Court held  that
    the Ravichandran principle applied when hearing asylum appeals  without
    exception and Rashid should no longer  be  followed.  The  question  of
    whether the appellant qualifies for asylum status is not a question  of
    discretion but one which must be decided on  the  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal and there is  no  legal  justification  for  approaching  that
    question with the presumption that the appellant  is  credible  arising
    from the respondent failing to discharge her obligation in relation  to
    family tracing: Lord Toulson at [72].

15.  In summarising  her  conclusions  at  [45]  the  judge  said  that  the
    appellant would "for the above reasons" as an 18 year old who has lived
    in the UK through  all  his  adolescence,  be  at  risk  on  return  to
    Afghanistan.  The only reason set out in the preceding  paragraphs  was
    the respondent's failure to discharge her  tracing  obligations.   That
    factor adds nothing to the fact that the appellant is 18, has lived  in
    the UK all through his adolescence, and  has  lost  touch  with  family
    members in Afghanistan.  The judge has given no  reason  why  the  fact
    that the appellant falls into that category would put him at real  risk
    of persecution in Afghanistan  and  she  has  failed  to  identify  any
    particular circumstances applying to the appellant which would put  him
    at such risk.  In summary, I am  satisfied  that  the  judge  erred  by
    taking the respondent's failure to trace into  account  as  a  relevant
    factor when assessing the asylum claim  and  has  failed  to  give  any
    adequate reasons explaining why the  appellant  would  be  at  risk  of
    serious harm in his circumstances.

16.  So far as article 8 is concerned I am satisfied that  the  judge  erred
    by failing to give any proper consideration to the public  interest  in
    maintaining immigration control.  Whilst noting that she had to conduct
    a balancing exercise between the appellant's interest  and  the  public
    interest, all the  factors  in  [55]-[61]  relate  to  the  appellant's
    circumstances.  Further, so far as these are concerned, I am  satisfied
    that the judge failed to take proper  account  of  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's private life has been established during a period when  his
    leave has been precarious, the statute  requiring  that  little  weight
    should be given to it in these circumstances.

17.  The judge noted the delay in making the  decision  on  the  appellant's
    application.  He had applied when he was 15 and it was decided when  he
    was 17.  The judge commented that  the  teenage  years  were  generally
    accepted to be  those  in  which  an  individual  matures  rapidly  and
    markedly and that a child of 15 may  be  regarded  as  noticeably  less
    developed socially, emotionally and indeed physically than  one  of  17
    and went on to comment that  leaving  the  appellant  in  limbo  for  a
    further two years at that significant  time  in  his  life  was  indeed
    significant.  However, it is not clear why this is so and what  bearing
    it has on the outcome of the appeal beyond the passage of time  or  how
    that relates to the private life provisions in para 276ADE of HC395.

18.  For these reasons I am satisfied that when considering  article  8  the
    judge left relevant matters out of account and failed  to  explain  why
    the delay in deciding the application was of such significance.

19.  In summary, I am  satisfied  that  then  judge  erred  in  law  in  her
    assessment  of  both  the  asylum  and  the  article  8  appeal.   Both
    representatives submitted that in these circumstances the proper course
    would be for the appeal to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a
    full re-hearing.  I am satisfied that this is the proper course to take
    in the circumstances of this appeal.



Decision

20.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law such  that  the  decision  is  set
    aside.   The  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal   for
    reconsideration by way of a full re-hearing by a different  judge.   No
    anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal.
