Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr B Hawkins, Counsel instructed by Arlington Crown
                  Solicitors
For the Claimant: Mr P Nath, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Andrews (promulgated on 20 August 2015)  dismissing
    the appeals against the Respondent's decision to remove the  Appellants
    on the basis that their removal will not  contravene  their  Convention
    rights and pursuant to removal directions issued under  section  10  of
    the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.




 2.  The  Appellants  appealed  against  that  decision  and  were  granted
    permission to appeal by Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Mahmood  on  all
    grounds.






 3. I was provided with a Rule 24 response from the Respondent.





    Concession


 4. In submissions before me, the Respondent accepted that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal made material errors of law in  relation  to  the  failure  to
    lawfully consider section 117B(6)of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 (as amended) particularly in light of paragraph 51(iii)
    of the decision which states that as the best interests  of  the  child
    are to return with his mother, then no  consideration  is  required  of
    section 117B(6). The Appellant was in agreement with this concession.


    Error of Law

 5. In light of the above agreement and concession  by  the  Respondent,  I
    find that the decision involved the making of an error of law as stated
    above. I find in particular that an error exists  as  identified  above
    given that the Tribunal is bound by statute to have "regard"  at  least
    to all of the sections of 117B and that there must be an assessment  of
    the public interest under section 117B(6) which confirms that if it  is
    not reasonable for a qualifying child to leave the UK, then  the  child
    and their parent is not required to go as that is not what  the  public
    interest requires (see Forman (ss 117A-C  considerations)  [2015]  UKUT
    412 (IAC) at [17(iii)] and  Treebhawon  and  others  (section  117B(6))
    [2015] UKUT 00674 (IAC) at [16(b) and 20-22]).





    Decision

 6. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.




 7. The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside  with  no
    findings preserved.



 8. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard de novo.







Signed                              Date 23/03/2016
