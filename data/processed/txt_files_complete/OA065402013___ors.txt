For the Appellants:    Mr Basharat Ali instructed by KC Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appeal of Mrs Elif Aybakar and others.   This  matter  came
    before me on 18 March 2014 where I provided  a  determination  set  out
    over six pages dealing with the error of law.  That determination  will
    form Appendix 1 to the determination that I am now making.

 2. There was one matter which arose in the course of the hearing  which  I
    identified in paragraph 11 of the determination.  This arose  from  the
    treatment of a sum of money which became available as a result  of  the
    cessation of the business being carried out  by  the  limited  company.
    The information showed that there were funds of �22,907, of  which  the
    sponsor's share was �21,761.65.  I was satisfied that  that  money  was
    created by the transactions which took place, but it was  important  in
    order to satisfy the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  that  the
    appellant demonstrate that it was properly  to  be  aggregated  to  the
    drawings from the business so that he could meet the  financial  limits
    of the Immigration Rules.  That was not a matter which in  my  judgment
    had been properly identified in the financial documentation which I had
    seen and since it was a matter raised  by  me  in  the  course  of  the
    hearing and for the first time, I did not consider it fair to  conclude
    the determination of the appeal without hearing additional material  on
    that issue.

 3. There is now to  hand  a  letter  from  Thornton  Hass  Ltd,  Chartered
    Accountants, dated 29 May 2014 which addresses  the  sum  of  money  to
    which I have referred. It says that dividends of �21,761  from  Capview
    Ltd, which ceased to trade on 30 September 2010, were declared in their
    financial accounts for the period 1 November 2011 to 30 September  2012
    and corporation tax was correctly paid on that profit, and as Mr  Akbar
    was a 95% shareholder it was therefore open to him to draw  down  those
    dividends in the form of a cash sum which was declared by  him  on  his
    tax returns for the year ending 5 April 2013.  It is apparent therefore
    that this sum of money, �21,761.65, should be treated as income in  the
    hands of the sponsor and could therefore be aggregated with  his  other
    income.  In those circumstances I am satisfied that the appellants  met
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules and consequently  the  appeal
    is allowed.

DECISION

    The Judge made an error on a point of law and I re-make the decision in
    the following terms:


          The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.


                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                 Appendix 1

Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr B. Ali, Solicitor, of Aman Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                      REASONS FOR FINDING ERROR OF LAW

 4. The appellants are Mrs Aybakar who was born on 15 November 1975 and who
    is a citizen of Turkey and her three children who are respectively aged
    9, 14 and 15.  The family sought entry clearance to join Mrs  Aybakar's
    husband and the father of the children who is the sponsor in the United
    Kingdom.  An application was made under the provisions  of  the  Ankara
    Agreement and the standstill provisions which are contained within  it.



 5. The issue before me  is  whether  the  business  which  undoubtedly  is
    operated in part at least by the sponsor is a business which  generates
    sufficient income profits or remuneration for those involved in  it  to
    satisfy the requirements for entry clearance of  this  family.   It  is
    common ground that the appellant has to show that her husband  is  able
    to generate income of �15,933 plus �10,200 by way of rent plus  council
    tax of �1,156.84 making a total of �27,289.84.  The only way  this  can
    be done or the only way this  was  attempted  to  be  achieved  was  by
    showing that the applicant had director's remuneration of  �11,487  and
    was in addition to that able to extract from  the  business  a  further
    amount of retained profit of something in the region of  �22,000.   The
    basis upon which he does that will be described by  me  now.   Page  99
    shows the relevant  accounts.   The  accounts  are  in  relation  to  a
    business called Catview Limited.  Catview Limited ceased to trade on 30
    September 2012.  The application was made on 11 January  2013  and  the
    decision made by the Secretary of State on 5  February  2013.   At  the
    time the decision was made, the limited company  had  ceased  to  trade
    because the business had effectively  been  carried  on  by  way  of  a
    partnership because that was the way Londis, the  well-known  chain  of
    grocery stores operated the  franchise.   They  were  not  prepared  to
    operate with  a  limited  company  and  insisted  on  the  partnership.
    However the partnership had only been operating for  a  matter  of  two
    months or so prior to the application being  made  and  there  were  no
    partnership profits or no partnership accounts ready to  indicate  what
    the partnership business was generating.  However, it was  exactly  the
    same business that was generating funds whether it is under  the  guise
    of a limited company or under a partnership.

 6. The accounts then which are found at page  99  onwards  deal  with  the
    period which  begins  on  1  November  2011  and  continues  until  its
    dissolution on 30 September 2012, a period of some eleven  months.   It
    is apparent from the partnership  accounts  that  the  sponsor  is  the
    director and his brother, Mr Hasan Aybakar is  the  secretary  and  the
    shareholding is distributed as to 95  to  the  sponsor  and  5  to  the
    company secretary, Mr Hasan Aybaker  -  see  page  101.   The  accounts
    themselves are prepared by Zek  and  Company  Accountants  of  Lordship
    Lane.  They are not apparently members of the ACCA or one of the  other
    branches of accountancy professionals but there is nothing  to  suggest
    that they are not accountants who have dealings with the revenue as  we
    will later see.

 7. What it shows is that the turnover of the business in 2012 was �192,000
    and that the operating profit generated by that over that eleven  month
    period was �22,907.  That was featured in another page of  the  bundle,
    page 109, where we see a computation of corporation tax straddling  two
    years and it is based on 20% of the sum of �22,907 which we  have  seen
    as the operating profit.  The paper trail continues because on page 128
    of the bundle there is a  company  short  tax  return  form  from  HMRC
    prepared by the sponsor covering the  period  1  November  2011  to  30
    September 2012 in which the figure of �22,907 was the  chargeable  gain
    as the profit before  other  deductions  and  reliefs  are  shown.   In
    addition, there is the figure  of  �4,581.40  which  was  the  taxation
    payable at the rate of 20% for the relevant period.  Accordingly, there
    is evidence at page 129  of  a  chargeable  gain  and  that  is  itself
    reflected in a further document at page 88 of the bundle  which  is  an
    acknowledgment of the company tax  return  from  HMRC  in  relation  to
    corporation tax as it covers Catview Limited  and  it  shows  the  same
    figure of �4,581.40 being the amount of money which  was  payable.   It
    follows that that there is evidence that the  company  Catview  Limited
    was able to generate a profit of something in  the  region  of  �22,907
    during that period and that, on dissolution, this was treated as having
    been distributed according to  the  shareholdings  as  to  95%  to  the
    sponsor which is the sum of �21,761.65.  That is described by the judge
    as director's remuneration but in fact it looks as if it is  a  capital
    sum which was distributed when the company ceased  to  operate.   Quite
    what happened to that money is not entirely clear  since  the  business
    continued to operate.  Had it been withdrawn from the business then the
    business, when continued as a partnership, would have been in debt to a
    further amount of �22,907.  I surmise that what in  fact  occurred  was
    that this sum, which was the retained profit, was  put  back  into  the
    business and therefore whilst it was a sum of money which was of  value
    to the appellant, may not have been income that he was able to  extract
    from the business.

 8. I need to say little more about the  accounts  save  that  there  is  a
    balance sheet  which  we  see  at  page  104.   The  balance  sheet  is
    instructive in that it is clear that the company has very little by way
    of assets.  It does not have any property and consequently  when  there
    was an assessment of its assets  the  assets  feature  as  equipment  -
    �1,999, a motor van - �8,296 and the rest is formed by way of stock and
    cash in hand.  Its total assets are about �70,000 of which cash in hand
    forms a sizeable part.  It follows that, whilst the whole  shareholding
    of the sponsor amounted to 95% share of the business, it is very much a
    share of the continuing business rather than a capital rich business.

 9. The question of what happened to the business  after  the  company  was
    dissolved is seen  in  pages  77  to  78  of  the  bundle  which  is  a
    partnership agreement.  The partnership agreement is  dated  1  October
    2012 and follows the day after the dissolution of the company and it is
    dealing with a partnership as between  the  sponsor  and  his  brother,
    Hasan and it  indicates  on  page  78  that  the  distribution  of  the
    partnership assets and drawings is, as between  the  sponsor,  95%  and
    Hasan, 5%.  In other words the distribution is the same as it was  when
    the limited company was operating.  It suggests to me that the  company
    should continue in exactly the same way in practical terms  as  it  did
    when it was a limited company.  The business  should  continue  in  the
    same form but the means by which it was to continue its business was as
    a partnership rather  than  as  a  limited  company.   The  partnership
    agreement was witnessed by the present representative of the sponsor in
    these  proceedings  which  is  Kuddus  Camaz  Solicitors  LLP  and  the
    agreement was in fact witnessed by one  of  the  partners.   I  am  not
    prepared to say that this was not a genuine partnership agreement which
    properly represented the contributions made as between the sponsor  and
    his brother and I have no reason at all to believe that this was a sham
    transaction or that the solicitors would have been involved in anything
    other than a genuine creation of a partnership.  It was on  this  basis
    that the application was made for entry  clearance  on  behalf  of  the
    appellants.

10. There was however a document prepared by a  second  company  which  was
    dated 15 January 2013 which indicated that  although  the  business  of
    Catview Limited which traded as Broadway Supersaver  was  held  by  the
    sponsor as to 95% in shares, the business used  to  be  carried  on  as
    Broadway Market Supersaver.  When the  sponsor  had  been  appointed  a
    partner on 1 April 2008 he only had a 51% interest in the  partnership,
    not 95%.  That obviously created a problem as  far  as  the  judge  was
    concerned although it has since been partly resolved by  evidence  from
    the sponsor in the form of a witness statement which is  found  between
    pages 7 and 16 of the bundle.  In the evidence  it  suggests  that  the
    sponsor injected some �40,000 worth of capital.  In  page  169  of  the
    bundle the sponsor's brother confirms that the  sponsor  injected  some
    �40,000 which he had initially provided to purchase the business and it
    was agreed because of this, that as the sponsor had provided the lion's
    share, this should be reflected in the fact that he was to hold 95%  of
    the shares.  His statement was not available to the  Immigration  Judge
    but it comes  as  evidence  which  is  provided  as  a  result  of  the
    determination.

11. In paragraph 23 of  the  determination  the  judge  comments  upon  the
    figures that I have mentioned and then says

         "The respondent has raised the  issue  that  the  only  independent
         evidence of the sponsor's income was a tax return showing  that  he
         earned �9,077 for the last financial year  but  that  there  is  no
         independent evidence of the  claimed  profit  of  the  business  of
         �33,907 last year.  I do not find the appellant has  satisfactorily
         addressed the concerns of the respondent. "

9.   In my judgment that was not a sustainable finding given the  fact  that
    the accounts which were prepared by an accountant reflected first  that
    there was a generation of income, secondly  that  this  resulted  in  a
    profit, thirdly that the profit gave rise to a liability for  taxation,
    fourthly that tax was paid or at least there was a  liability  for  tax
    which was acknowledged by the Inland Revenue and fifthly  it  indicated
    that the distribution available between shareholders was as to  95%  to
    the sponsor and 5% to his brother.  Consequently, unless these accounts
    are in sham, and an expensive sham which resulted in  a  liability  for
    corporation tax, then unless these documents are a sham,  they  show  a
    business that was operating.  Indeed it is difficult to  see  how  that
    business did not operate since it has got premises with a  business  on
    it.  It follows a train of business activity for example in   the  year
    ending April 2009 it generated a turnover of �200,000, in the tax  year
    ending April 2010 it generated a turnover of �209,000 and  in  the  tax
    year ending April 2011 it generated a turnover  of  �222,000.   All  of
    these figures suggest  that  it  was  a  perfectly  normally  operating
    business.

12. The judge then goes on to deal in paragraph  24  of  the  determination
    with the fact that the sponsor then owned 95%  of  the  shares  in  the
    business but that satisfactory evidence of this had not been  provided.
    As I have already pointed out there  were  accounts  which  showed  the
    ownership of shares as to 95% to the sponsor and  5%  to  his  brother.
    There was evidence  of  a  partnership  agreement  which  followed  the
    dissolution of the company on 30 September 2012  which  indicated  that
    the partnership which was to take over the business was to be held in a
    similar ratio and the partnership  agreement  was  either  prepared  by
    professionals or  it  was  actually  prepared  by  the  solicitors  who
    witnessed the partnership agreement.  Accordingly, to  say  that  there
    was no satisfactory evidence as to ownership  is  simply  not  correct.
    There is an issue as to how circumstances came about that the sponsor's
    51% interest was transformed into a 95% shareholding but that does  not
    indicate that the transactions with which I have  dealt  were  sham  or
    that there was not a bona fide  and  entirely  lawful  division  as  to
    ownership when Catview Limited stopped to trade.

13. It was said by the judge that the  letter  of  Zek  and  Company  which
    stated that the sponsor's share ownership was 95% and that his previous
    shareholding was 51% was unsupported by any evidence.  The  judge  said
    thee has been no indication on what basis  the  accountants  made  that
    statement.  In my judgment they made that statement  on  the  basis  of
    their knowledge as accountants.  As such there is no reason to  suggest
    that the documentary evidence in  relation  to  the  accounts  and  the
    ownership of the shares should be considered to be  suspect,  at  least
    without first putting the appellant on notice.  It is true  that  there
    was no statement from the brother and no explanation given as to why he
    should give up all but 5% of his interest in the business but that does
    not mean to say that the accounts did not  properly  reflect  what  the
    legal situation was.

14. In paragraph 25 of the determination the judge refers to the fact  that
    there were profits of �22,907 and  the  sponsor's  share  of  that  was
    �21,761.65. The judge said that there was  no  supporting  evidence  of
    receipt of that amount by the sponsor. There  is  minimal  evidence  of
    income derived from the profits received by the sponsor and the P60s do
    not support the assertion that this was income which he received in his
    hands. Whilst in my judgment the judge was  wrong  in  challenging  the
    accounts as being satisfactory evidence of the financial operations  of
    this business, there is a doubt in  my  mind  as  to  what  income  the
    dissolution of the company generated in terms of this sum of money.  If
    it was simply distributed to the shareholders then it occurs to me that
    it would have  resulted  in  the  current  business  carried  on  by  a
    partnership having a shortfall of �22,907. If that were the  case  then
    it would, on its face, have been a  business  which  was  not  able  to
    operate in the same way as it had operated previously. If, on the other
    hand, the �22,000 worth of 'retained' profits was simply paid back into
    the partnership, then there was not income sufficient to form the basis
    for the assertion made on behalf of the appellant that he had available
    to him not only his directors  remuneration  of  �11,000  odd  but,  in
    addition, 95% of the retained profits from the business in the  sum  of
    �21,761.

15. This is a point which was only raised  by  me  in  the  course  of  the
    hearing.  I  do  not  consider  that  it  is  fair  to   conclude   the
    determination of this appeal without ascertaining what occurred to  the
    retained profits and whether they should properly  be  aggregated  with
    the appellant's other income in order to establish that  he  meets  the
    requirements of the immigration rules. With  the  passage  of  time  it
    should  now  be  possible  to  follow  the  paper  trail.    In   these
    circumstances I am going to adjourn the hearing of this appeal so  that
    this issue can be resolved, having found that there  was  an  error  of
    law.

I DIRECT

 1. The re-making of the decision is adjourned to the First Available  Date
    after 16 May 2014.

 2. The principal appellant is to serve and file no later than 16 May  2014
    all such documentary evidence upon which she intends to rely (which may
    include a witness statement from the partnership accountant or  another
    accountant) dealing with

               a) whether the  sum  of  �21,761  being  95%  of  the  profit
                  generated by the company by the time  of  its  dissolution
                  should be treated as income in the hands  of  the  sponsor
                  such that his other income at the  date  of  the  decision
                  should be aggregated with that sum;

               b) whether the sum of �21,761 was taxable in the hands of the
                  sponsor and, if not, how  it  could  then  be  treated  as
                  income  which  should   be   aggregated   to   his   other
                  income/remuneration;

               c) if taxable, whether tax was paid:

               d) on what  basis  the  appellant  puts  her  case  that  the
                  sponsor's  financial  position  at   the   material   time
                  satisfied the requirements that the appellants  needed  to
                  meet  in  order  to  gain  entry   clearance   under   the
                  Immigration Rules.

 3. If the appellants fail to  comply  with  the  above  requirements,  the
    Tribunal will infer that the failure amounts to an acceptance that  the
    sum of �21,761 should not properly have been treated as forming part of
    the sponsor's income for the purposes of  calculating  the  amount  the
    sponsor was required to establish in order for the appellants to secure
    entry clearance under  the  Immigration  Rules.   In  that  event,  the
    appellants' appeal will be dismissed.

 4. The hearing will take place at Field House, time estimate  45  minutes,
    before me. The evidence will be  restricted  to  the  issue  identified
    above.  No interpreter.
