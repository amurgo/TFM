Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Mian, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who applied for leave to  remain
    in the United Kingdom based on the partner route, he being  married  to
    Mrs [NB], a British citizen.

 2. On 12th November 2015 the  Respondent  refused  the  application.   The
    Secretary of State contended that  there  had  been  deception  in  the
    manner in which the Appellant had obtained his TOEIC  certificate  from
    Educational Testing Service.  The Appellant appealed and his appeal was
    heard on 21st March 2018 by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Mill
    sitting at Harmondsworth.  Judge Mill found the Appellant  credible  in
    every material particular but still dismissed the appeal on  the  basis
    that the  Appellant  could  make  application  outside  of  the  United
    Kingdom.  I should say that the burden of proof was of  course  on  the
    Secretary of State in respect of the deception  and  the  Secretary  of
    State failed to discharge the burden as found by Judge Mill.

 3. Not content with the decision, by Notice of Appeal dated 9th April 2018
    the Appellant made application for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  That was refused, but a renewed application was  allowed  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Keki? on 1st November 2018  and  thus  the  matter
    comes before me.

 4. Quite properly, in my view, the Secretary of State took the  view  that
    the judge had erred in law and that it was not possible to resist that.
     Mr Walker again, very reasonably in my view, concedes the  appeal.   I
    have to say that given the guidance in the  case  of  Chikwamba  it  is
    unlikely that I would have come to any different view even if I had not
    heard any submissions.

 5. Be that as it may, by consent  the  Secretary  of  State  concedes  the
    appeal and, for the avoidance of doubt, accepts that the appeal  should
    recognise that this Appellant is entitled to  rely  on  the  "five-year
    route" with respect to his relationship with his spouse.

Notice of Decision

 6. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and remade in  the
    Upper Tribunal, such that the appeal  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    allowed.

 7. No anonymity direction is made.

Signed                              Date: 7 January 2019

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to  make  a  full  fee
award in the sum of ï¿½140.00.

Signed                              Date: 7 January 2019
