                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DECISION AND REASONS (P)

 1. The appellant is an Indian national who was born on 20  December  2000.
    He appeals against a decision which was  issued  by  Judge  A.J.  Blake
    ("the judge")  on  23  October  2019.   In  that  decision,  the  judge
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  respondent's  refusal  of
    his human rights claim.

Background

 2. The appellant's parents are Mr Narayana  Samy  Annes  and  Mrs  Kavitha
    Annes.  The family lived together in India until 2008,  when  Mr  Annes
    came to the UK as a  domestic  worker.   He  was  subsequently  granted
    Indefinite Leave to Remain and,  in  2015,  he  was  naturalised  as  a
    British citizen.  Also in 2015, Mr Annes sponsored his wife  and  child
    to enter the UK as his dependent relatives.   Their  applications  were
    successful and on 17 September  2015,  the  appellant  and  his  mother
    entered the UK with entry clearance in that capacity.

 3. Sadly, the relationship between the  appellant's  parents  deteriorated
    and, on 8 January 2019, his mother departed the UK voluntarily, leaving
    the appellant in the care of his father.  Shortly before she left,  she
    wrote a letter to the Home Office which was to be used  in  support  of
    the appellant's application for indefinite leave to remain.  It  stated
    materially as follows:

         "I am writing to confirm that I hereby give my full consent for  my
         son, Master Ramanathan Annes  to  apply  for  indefinite  leave  to
         remain in the UK as the dependant of his father, Mr  Narayana  Samy
         Annes.

         The relationship between Mr Narayana  Samy  Annes  and  myself  has
         broken down and I am retuning [sic] to my home country India.

         I have given full  responsibility  of  my  Master  Ramanathan  Anes
         upbringing and financial support to his  father  Mr  Narayana  Samy
         Annes and I confirm that I want my son  to  stay  in  UK  with  his
         father as I can't look after my son.

 4. The appellant's first application for leave to remain with  his  father
    was certified as clearly unfounded.   His  second  was  withdrawn.   He
    submitted his third application on the date of his mother's letter:  18
    December 2018.  That date is of some significance,  since  it  was  two
    days before the appellant attained his majority.  The  application  was
    supported by a raft of documentary evidence, including some  which  was
    directed to showing that the appellant's father was in  a  position  to
    maintain him adequately.

 5. On 2 July 2019, the respondent refused the appellant's application in a
    fifteen page decision.  There is a good  deal  of  repetition  in  that
    letter but the core reasoning is as follows.  Because  the  application
    had been submitted two days before the appellant turned  eighteen,  the
    respondent considered  the  application  under  paragraph  298  of  the
    Immigration Rules (a person seeking ILR as the child of a parents (etc)
    present and settled in the UK).  The respondent was satisfied that  the
    appellant's mother had returned to India and that his  father  had  had
    sole responsibility for him since then, such that  paragraph  298(i)(c)
    of the Immigration Rules was met.   She  was  not  satisfied,  however,
    that paragraph 298(iv) and (v) were met, however, because she  did  not
    consider that the sponsor could accommodate and maintain the  appellant
    adequately.   The  respondent  then  considered  whether   there   were
    circumstances outside the Immigration Rules which warranted a grant  of
    leave to remain as a result of Article  8  ECHR.   She  concluded  that
    there were not.  The appellant's mother made no reference in her letter
    to having disowned him.  He had lived with his mother in India for many
    years and would be able to return to live with her and other  relatives
    whilst he was supported financially by his father.  He wished to remain
    in the UK with his father and to study here but he could study in India
    and could remain in contact with his father via Skype and  visits.   He
    did not qualify for leave under the Immigration Rules and there were no
    exceptional circumstances which warranted  a  grant  of  leave  outside
    those Rules.

 6. The appeal came before the judge as a floating case at Taylor House  on
    27 September 2019.  The  appellant  was  represented  by  counsel,  the
    respondent by a Presenting Officer.  The judge heard evidence from  the
    appellant and his father and  submissions  from  the  advocates  before
    reserving his decision.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 7. In his reserved decision, the judge concluded materially as follows.

 8. The appellant had not addressed the ground  of  refusal  regarding  his
    father's income; there had been ample opportunity to adduce evidence of
    the claimed income of ï¿½30,00 per annum but this had not been  done  and
    the analysis in the refusal letter  stood:  [80]-[83].   The  appellant
    could not meet the requirements for ILR under paragraph  298  for  that
    reason.

 9. As for the Article 8 ECHR claim outside the Rules, the judge noted that
    the appellant's father had had sole responsibility for  him  since  his
    mother had left for India in January 2019: [85].   The  judge  did  not
    accept, however, that the appellant's  mother  had  disowned  him;  the
    letter from her did not support that assertion and there was  no  other
    evidence in support of it: [86].   The  appellant's  adult  sister  and
    grandmother  remained  in  India:  [87].   The  judge  noted  that  the
    appellant and his mother had  lived  together  in  India,  without  his
    father, for seven years.  He considered that the appellant could return
    to India and enjoy the support of his mother, grandmother  and  sister.
    He did not accept that the appellant knew little about his grandmother:
    [88].  The appellant had completed his education in the UK.  He  wished
    to progress to university here but  there  was  a  working  educational
    system in India.  It was open to the appellant to seek entry  clearance
    as a student.  He would be able to keep in touch with  his  father  via
    contact and visits and he could continue to receive  financial  support
    from him in India: [89]-[90].  In  the  circumstances,  there  were  no
    'exceptional circumstances such as to warrant the grant of  leave'  and
    the appeal was dismissed: [90].

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

10. In grounds of appeal which were settled by the appellant's  solicitors,
    two short points were advanced.  Firstly, that the  judge  had  made  a
    finding which was 'wholly against the evidence' when he concluded  that
    the appellant could live with  his  mother  in  India.   This  was  not
    possible  because  the  appellant  was  estranged  from   his   mother.
    Secondly, the finding was contrary to the respondent's acceptance  that
    the appellant's father had had sole responsibility for  his  upbringing
    since his mother had left the United Kingdom.  The decision was  wholly
    premised on the theory that the appellant could rejoin his  mother  but
    that premise was flawed.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal,
    who accepted (without adding more) that these points were arguable.

12. The papers were placed before Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara on  30  April
    2020.  She had considered, as a result of  the  pandemic,  whether  the
    appeal  might  be  decided  without  a  hearing.   She  had  concluded,
    provisionally, that the appeal was suitable for determination  in  that
    manner.  She issued directions designed to elicit any objection to that
    course of action and any further submissions which the  parties  wished
    to make on the merits of the appeal.

13. On 27 May 2020, the appellant's solicitors wrote to the Upper  Tribunal
    stating that they wished to rely on the grounds of appeal  and  had  no
    further submissions to make.  On 5 June 2020, the  respondent  filed  a
    short reply to the grounds of appeal, submitting that the  decision  of
    the judge contained no legal error and should be upheld.

14. Neither party objected to  the  course  of  action  proposed  by  Judge
    Kamara,  therefore.   Rule  34(1)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 confers a discretion upon the Tribunal to make any
    decision without a hearing.  By rule 34(2), it must have regard to  any
    views expressed by a party when deciding whether to hold a hearing.

15. The parties were asked for their  views  on  Judge  Kamara's  proposal.
    Neither objected to the appeal being determined on the papers.  That is
    relevant but it is not determinative.  It remains for  me  to  consider
    whether, in the exercise of my discretion, I  should  proceed  in  that
    way.  Having considered the over-riding objective, and having  reminded
    myself of what was said in Osborn v Parole Board [2014] 1  AC  1115,  I
    consider it fair and just to proceed on the papers.  The case  involves
    no disputed oral evidence or the credibility of a party or  a  witness;
    the only question, at this stage, is whether the FtT erred  in  law  in
    deciding the appeal as it did.  I consider that I am properly  able  to
    determine that question on the basis of the grounds of appeal  and  the
    submissions made by Mr Tan, the Senior Presenting Officer  who  settled
    the respondent's reply to directions.

Discussion

16. The grounds of appeal are misconceived.  The first  complaint  is  that
    the judge's finding that the appellant could live with  his  mother  in
    India was made in error, when it was recalled that  the  appellant  was
    estranged from his mother.  As noted by Mr Tan in the rule 24 response,
    however, this is to overlook the finding made by  the  judge  that  the
    appellant has not been disowned by his mother.  That finding  was  open
    to the judge on  the  evidence,  and  was  a  clear  rejection  of  the
    appellant's account that he had been disowned by his  mother  when  she
    left the UK.

17. It is then submitted by the appellant that it was not open to the judge
    to conclude that the appellant could return to  live  with  his  mother
    when it had been accepted by the respondent that  his  father  had  had
    sole responsibility  for  him  since  January  2019,  when  his  mother
    returned to India.  This submission adopts a rather selective  approach
    to the respondent's lengthy decision.  Although it is correct to  state
    that the respondent accepted in terms that the requirement in paragraph
    298(i)(c) of the Immigration Rules was  met,  that  was  not  her  only
    conclusion in relation to the appellant's mother.  Like the judge,  the
    respondent did not accept that the appellant had been disowned  by  his
    mother.  She evidently concluded, as did the judge, that the  appellant
    had an extant or renewable connection with  his  mother  and  that  she
    would 'provide a base' for the appellant to return to in India, as  she
    put it at the foot of p6 of the letter of refusal.

18. Insofar as it might be suggested that  the  respondent's  decision  (or
    that of the judge) was contradictory in this respect, that is  not  so.
    As has been explained in  a  number  of  authorities  over  the  years,
    including TD (Yemen) [2006] UKIAT 49 and Buydov [2012] EWCA  Civ  1739,
    the focus of a sole responsibility enquiry in a 'two parent case'  such
    as this is on the extent to which each parent takes responsibility  for
    the child's upbringing.  Even if  the  respondent  concluded  that  the
    appellant's  mother  had  not  disowned  him,  she  could  lawfully  be
    satisfied that it was his father who was responsible for his upbringing
    and had been taking all the decisions in his life since  the  start  of
    2019 (at which point he was over 18).

19. The judge's findings could not, to my mind, be any clearer.  He did not
    accept that the appellant's mother wanted nothing further  to  do  with
    him even though she was content for him to remain in the  UK  with  his
    father.  He concluded, in light of the evidence which he had  and  that
    which  he  did  not  have,  that  the  appellant's  mother  (and  other
    relatives) would be there to support him when, as  a  young  adult,  he
    returned to the country of his nationality after spending a  few  years
    in the UK.  These conclusions were open to the judge  on  the  evidence
    before him, as  was  his  ultimate  conclusion  that  the  respondent's
    decision was proportionate under Article 8 ECHR.
