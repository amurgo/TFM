                                   Between

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                    SALL
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Secretary of State:  Mr T. Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The Secretary of State is the appellant in the Upper Tribunal.
      2. Mr Sall and his solicitors, Waterstone Solicitors, were advised  of
         the hearing date and have acknowledged it in Waterstone's letter of
         12 March 2019.
      3. In the letter the appellant has sought to withdraw his appeal  but,
         in doing so, fails to acknowledge that it is the Secretary of State
         who remains the appellant, even in the re-making of  the  decision.
         As a respondent to the appeal in the Upper Tribunal, Mr Sall is not
         permitted to withdraw the appeal.
      4. There was no appearance of Mr Sall or  his  representative  at  the
         hearing before me.  This is unsurprising given his wish  no  longer
         to participate in the appeal.  In  particular,  he  has  failed  to
         adduce the evidence necessary to demonstrate that, as an  adult  in
         paid employment, he was unable to support himself on his income and
         therefore fell to be considered as a dependant of his father.


         DECISION


         Having found that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be
         set aside,
          i) I allow the appeal of the Secretary of State;
         ii) I re-make the decision by dismissing the  appeal  of  Mr  Sall
             against the decision of the Secretary of State made on 12  May
             2017 refusing his application for a permanent residence card.

                                                 DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE
                                                               14 March 2019
