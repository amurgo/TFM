                                    [H L]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr D Katani, of Katani & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals  against  the  decision  of  FtT  Judge  Debra  H
    Clapham, promulgated on 4 July 2019.

 2. The FtT's decision at [34] refers to section 117B of the 2002 Act,  and
    says that it "specifically states that consideration has to be given to
    whether it would be unduly harsh to  expect  the  qualifying  child  to
    leave the UK".

 3. The case involves two "qualifying" children, in terms of part 5A of the
    2002 Act.

 4. Section 117B(6) provides that in  a  case  such  as  this,  the  public
    interest does not require removal "where ... it would not be reasonable
    to  expect  the  child  to  leave  the  UK."   It  does   not   specify
    consideration of whether departure would be "unduly harsh".

 5. The respondent conceded that the decision of the FtT errs on a point of
    law, and that considering the circumstances of  the  two  children,  it
    fell to be reversed.

 6. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside, and the following
    decision is substituted: the appeal, as brought to the FtT, is allowed.

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
