Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellants' appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Caswell
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 14th October 2014.

 2. The sponsor came to the UK in 2006 as a  religious  worker  married  at
    that time to the first appellant Satinder Kaur.  He returned  to  India
    for visits but divorced her in 2008 and married an English woman.  That
    marriage broke down in early 2013 and the sponsor remarried  the  first
    appellant.

 3. She applied for entry clearance with their three  children,  the  three
    other appellants, but was refused on the grounds that the sponsor could
    not  meet  the  maintenance  requirements  of  the  Rules.   The  Entry
    Clearance Officer, as a result of checks conducted with  colleagues  in
    HMRC was not satisfied that the sponsor was employed as claimed,  since
    HMRC had no record of him paying tax during the relevant period.

 4. Shortly before the hearing  the  Presenting  Officer  raised  a  second
    issue, namely the subsistence of the marriage.

 5. The judge wrote as follows:

         "On the issue of the subsistence of  the  marriage  I  accept  that
         there is an odd background here.  The Sponsor certainly did divorce
         from the first-named Appellant, married an English woman, and  then
         was divorced from her  and  remarried  the  first-named  Appellant.
         There is a confusing history of  the  whereabouts  of  two  of  the
         children as well with the application  for  entry  clearance  being
         made at a time when their mother remained  in  India  in  the  same
         village as the children yet the Sponsor was saying at the time that
         he had sole responsibility for them.

         There is evidence of extensive contact between the Sponsor and  the
         Appellants in the Lycamobile records.  This  does  not  necessarily
         show an intention for husband and wife to live together permanently
         if they are allowed to join  the  Sponsor,  however.   There  is  a
         certain amount of other evidence in the  form  of  photographs  for
         instance but overall the  evidence  for  the  subsistence  of  this
         marriage  is  sparse.   Against  the  unusual  background   already
         outlined I am not satisfied that there  is  a  subsisting  marriage
         here, where each of the parties to it intends to  live  permanently
         with the other as husband and wife."

 6. The judge also recorded that it  may  well  be  that  the  sponsor  was
    unaware of Chapeltown Mini Market's failure to pass on  the  tax  which
    they were deducting from his payslips to the Inland Revenue,  but  even
    if this was the case it did not mean that  the  employment  was  legal.
    She dismissed the appeals under the Rules and with respect  to  Article
    8.

 7. The appellants sought permission to appeal which was granted  by  Judge
    Cruthers on 29th December 2014.

 8. On 12th January 2015  the  respondent  served  a  reply  defending  the
    determination.



Consideration of whether there is an error of law

 9. I am satisfied that the judge did err in law for the following reasons.

10. First, in her assessment of the evidence relating to this marriage.  Mr
    Diwnycz made no submission in relation to the judge's findings. I agree
    with Ms Faryll that she did not take into account all of  the  relevant
    evidence when assessing the present relationship, no  doubt  influenced
    by the complexities of their past.   There  were  pages  and  pages  of
    evidence of telephone calls, and evidence of remittances being sent  by
    the sponsor to the family and as  well  as  many  photographs  of  them
    together. Moreover  the  couple  have  three  children  and  there  was
    evidence from the sponsor, both in his witness statement and presumably
    in oral evidence, of a reconciliation.

11. Second, she seems to have accepted that the  sponsor  himself  was  not
    aware of his employer's failures with respect to  the  Inland  Revenue.
    The refusal refers to the suitability requirements.   The  question  of
    whether the sponsor was culpable or whether he was  an  innocent  party
    needs to be resolved in order to decide whether the refusal  should  be
    maintained on suitability grounds, which is of course discretionary and
    not mandatory.

12. Finally, the judge said that the employment had to be "legal" in  order
    to qualify under the Immigration Rules.  It is not entirely clear  what
    is meant by that or whether any final resolution has been  made  as  to
    whether the employers were acting illegally.  They are presently  under
    investigation but at the present time it  is  not  established  whether
    they have committed a criminal offence  or  whether  innocent  mistakes
    have been made.

13. The decision of Judge Caswell is set aside.

14. It must be re-made but it was not  possible  to  complete  the  hearing
    today because Mr Diwnycz was not able to get the information  which  he
    needed from the Inland Revenue.

The resumed hearing

15. At the resumed hearing Mr Diwnycz produced a witness statement form  an
    officer of HMRC dated 3rd June 2015 providing  details  of  information
    held on HMRC systems in relation to the sponsor.   It  states  that  he
    earned �5,760 in the tax year 2008/2009, no employment recorded in  the
    tax years 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013.

16. In 2013/2014 he is  recorded  as  having  earned  �8,157.66  at  Paul's
    Supersave Limited with tax deducted of �1,629.60.  At R  &  D  2  Pizza
    Limited he earned  �1,478.69  with  tax  deducted  of  �295.40  and  at
    Yorkshire Doughball Limited trading as Dominos Pizza �1,822.89 with  no
    tax deducted.

17. In the tax year following the date of decision he is recorded as having
    earned �845 at MW Marketing Solutions  Limited  with  tax  deducted  of
    �169, �5,765.72 at Pendas Way  Off  Licence  with  �1,152.80  deducted,
    �4,427.42 at Chapeltown Mini  Market  Limited  with  no  tax  deducted,
    �4,106.90 at R & D 2 Pizza Limited with �586.20 deducted and  �1,165.38
    at Pauls Supersave Limited with tax deducted of �233.

18. That information is, sadly, in direct contradiction to  another  letter
    provided by HMRC dated 2 June 2015 which records the sponsor as  having
    earned �19,818.24 at Chapeltown Mini Market from 2010/2011.  Under  the
    column unhelpfully headed 'tax' a figure of �2,667.60  is  given.   For
    2011/2012 with the same employer his pay is  recorded  as  having  been
    �9,729.98 with tax of �1,196.  For 2012/2013 again with Chapeltown Mini
    Market his pay is recorded as being �19,585.33 with tax of �2,263.80.

19. For the tax year covering the date of decision he is shown as receiving
    �1,478.69 from R & D Pizza Limited with tax of �295.40, �8,157.66  from
    Paul's  Supersave  Limited  with  tax  of  �1,629.60,  �1,822.89   from
    Yorkshire Doughball Limited with no tax  and  �18,341  from  Chapeltown
    Mini Market with tax of �1,813.20.

20. The total is erroneously marked as �28,800.24 for the pay (it should be
    �29,800.24) and �3,738.20 for the tax.

21. Mr Diwnycz said that he did  not  wish  to  cross-examine  the  sponsor
    either in relation to the subsistence of his marriage or in relation to
    his tax affairs.  He accepted that according to the sponsor's  payslips
    tax was being deducted by Chapeltown Mini Market.  So far as the  other
    employment was concerned he accepted that for the tax  years  2013/2014
    tax was recorded as having been deducted but he said that that did  not
    mean that it was being paid. He suggested  that  tax  deducted  on  the
    witness statement referred to tax  being  deducted  from  the  payslips
    rather than tax being received by the Inland Revenue.   He agreed  that
    it was not possible to reconcile the witness statement from HMRC, which
    said that no employment was recorded for the tax years 2009/2013,  with
    the Inland Revenue's letter of  2nd  June  2015  which  sets  out  full
    details of his employment in  2010/2011,  2011/2012  and  2012/2013  as
    being with Chapeltown Mini Market.

22. Ms Farryl asked me to rely on the letter of 2nd  June  2015  which  she
    said was supported by other evidence from the Inland Revenue.

23. First, there is a letter dated 23rd October 2014 to the  sponsor  which
    states that:

         "As requested in the letter I would advise  you  that  as  per  our
         records your 2013 to 2014 pay and tax information for R & D 2 Pizza
         Limited was pay of �1,478.69 with tax of  �295.40  and  for  Paul's
         Supersave Limited was pay �8,157.66 and tax of �1,629.60."

24. Those figures are identical to the figures produced in  her  letter  of
    2nd June 2015.

25. Second, she relied on the HM Revenue and Customs  tax  calculation  for
    the tax year 2013/2014 which records  the  sponsor's  total  income  as
    �29,800 and tax paid of �3,738.20 which are the same figures as in  the
    letter of 2nd June 2015, making allowance for the arithmetical error in
    that letter, which reads �28,800 and not �29,800.

26. Third, she relies on the letter from HM Revenue and Customs dated  30th
    September 2014 which confirms that the sponsor's income  tax  liability
    for all tax years up to and including the 2012/2013  tax  year  can  be
    treated as cleared and up to date.

27. That letter also states:

         "It appears that Chapeltown Mini Market may have failed to  operate
         PAYE correctly and as advised  in  my  colleague's  letter  of  4th
         August 2014 this  is  currently  under  review  with  our  employer
         complaints team.  Their review may take some time to complete.   It
         does however appear clear that you have tried  to  bring  your  tax
         affairs up to date and the problem of any under  deduction  of  tax
         for the 2013 to 2014 tax year may well  lie  with  Chapeltown  Mini
         Market.

         I would advise that where we establish that the employer has failed
         to act in accordance with the PAYE Regulations we may ask  them  to
         make good the shortfall of tax."

Findings and Conclusions

28. The letter of 2nd June 2015 from HMRC  is  corroborated  by  two  other
    documents from them, namely the letter  of  23rd  October  2014,  which
    gives the same figures  and  the  tax  calculation  for  the  tax  year
    2013/2014 dated 2nd November 2014 which gives the correct total  figure
    for the sponsor's employment, albeit  that  there  is  an  arithmetical
    error in the letter of 2nd June 2015.  Accordingly  I  rely  on  it  as
    being the proper reflection of the  sponsor's  earnings  for  that  tax
    year.

29. In order to meet the maintenance requirements of the Immigration  Rules
    the sponsor needs an annual income of  �27,200.   On  the  evidence,  I
    conclude that he earned �29,800.24 and  therefore  meets  the  relevant
    requirements.

30. An issue arose before the previous judge in relation to the legality of
    that employment.  It seems to have been  argued  before  her  that  the
    sponsor's employment was not legal because his employer was not passing
    on the tax which  was  deducted  from  the  sponsor's  wages  to  HMRC.
    Reliance was placed upon the evidential requirements under Appendix  FM
    which states that all income and savings must be lawfully derived.

31. Mr Diwnycz did not pursue that line of argument today.  It is not being
    argued here that the sponsor was party to any  fraud  and  indeed  HMRC
    itself in their letter of 30th September 2014 appears to have  come  to
    the conclusion that the fault lies with Chapeltown  Mini  Market.  HMRC
    has not concluded its investigations  and  at  this  stage  it  is  not
    possible to say whether there has been any criminality on the  part  of
    the  employer.  Certainly  however  the  remedy,  so  far  as  HMRC  is
    concerned, is to require the employer and not the sponsor to make  good
    the shortfall in tax.  Indeed it is clear that the  sponsor  has  taken
    all reasonable steps to try to ensure that his affairs are in order.

32. Mr Diwnycz accepted that the  phrase  "lawfully  derived"  refers,  for
    example, to involvement in a criminal enterprise,  or  not  having  the
    right to work in the UK, neither applicable here.

33. Mr Diwnycz did not seek to cross-examine the sponsor in relation to the
    subsistence of the marriage and said that he was content to  leave  the
    matter in my hands.  He did not  seek  to  challenge  in  any  way  the
    substantial  evidence  of  contact  between  the  couple,  namely   the
    telephone calls, the  remittances,  the  photographs  and  their  three
    children.

34. I find it more probable than  not  that  the  parties  intend  to  live
    together  as  husband  and  wife  and  that  this   is   a   subsisting
    relationship.

35. The Entry Clearance Officer, on the basis  of  the  information  before
    him, was not satisfied that the appellant's  various  employments  were
    genuine.  On the basis of the evidence  now  provided  by  HMRC,  I  am
    satisfied that the sponsor was working as claimed.  I am also satisfied
    that his employer's failure to pass on the tax which was being deducted
    from his payslips was without his  consent  and  knowledge.  He  should
    therefore not be refused on suitability grounds.

36. Accordingly the requirements of the Immigration Rules are met.

37. Notice of Decision

38. The original judge erred in law.  Her decision has been set aside.   It
    is re-made as follows.  The appellants' appeals are allowed.
