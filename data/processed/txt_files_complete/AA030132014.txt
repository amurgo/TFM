Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Radford, counsel instructed by Turpin & Miller
Solicitors


                              Decision to remit

 1. I have set aside the determination of Judge Wellesley-Cole  promulgated
    on the 16th July 2014.


 2. Ms Radford submitted that this was an appropriate case to  be  remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal having regard to the fact that the appellant
    there would have to be a complete rehearing with substantial  evidence.
    The Tribunal had not considered the applicable country  guidance  case.
    Accordingly, the respondent had not had the opportunity of  having  his
    case properly considered by the First-tier Tribunal.


 3. Mr Walker did not oppose that application.   I  accept  the  submission
    that there will have to be a complete re-hearing.


 4. I also consider that it is appropriate for the appeal to be remitted to
    the First-tier Tribunal. I have had regard to  the  Senior  President's
    Practice Statement in this regard. I am satisfied that  the  nature  or
    extent of any judicial fact finding which is necessary in order for the
    decision in the appeal to be remade is such that having regard  to  the
    overriding objective in Rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case.


 5. The agreed hearing date is the 14th April 2015  at  Taylor  House,  not
    before FTT Judge Wellesley-Cole.
