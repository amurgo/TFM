                                  JUDGMENT

   1. The applicants, who are brothers,  have  been  granted  permission  to
      bring a judicial review of the decision of the respondent to refuse to
      grant them leave to remain  as  Tier  1  Entrepreneurs.  Although  the
      original grounds set out various complaints about  that  decision,  in
      granting permission Judge  Peter  Lane  limited  the  scope  of  these
      proceedings to a  single  ground  of  challenge,  that  concerning  an
      asserted legitimate expectation the applicants  say  had  arisen  that
      their applications would succeed, despite not being able to  meet  the
      precise requirements of the applicable immigration  rule,  because  of
      reassurance  given  during  a  telephone  call  to  the   respondent's
      telephone help line.


   2. In order to qualify under the immigration rules for leave to remain as
      Entrepreneurs, the Immigration rules demand that the applicants  must,
      amongst other things, score 75 points under  Appendix  A  (Attributes)
      and provide the specified documents required  by  paragraph  41-SD  of
      Appendix A. The  applications  were  refused  because  the  respondent
      concluded that they had not provided a specified document, that  being
      a letter from the bank of the third party,  who  was  the  applicants'
      uncle, that met the requirements of 41-SD by including within  it  the
      names of the applicants.

   3. Before examining the matters in issue between the parties  in  detail,
      it is helpful to set out the provisions of the immigration  rules,  as
      they were at the date of the respondent's decision on 29 May 2013,  so
      far as they are relevant for present  purposes:  The  rule  concerning
      such applications for leave to remain in this capacity is 245DD:

           245DD. Requirements for leave to remain

           To qualify for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)
           Migrant under this rule, an applicant must meet the requirements
           listed below. If the applicant meets these requirements, leave
           to remain will be granted. If the applicant does not meet these
           requirements, the application will be refused.

           Requirements:

           (a) The applicant must not fall for refusal under the general
           grounds for refusal, except that paragraph 322(10) shall not
           apply, and must not be an illegal entrant.

           (b) The applicant must have a minimum of 75 points under
           paragraphs 35 to 53 of Appendix A.

           (c) The applicant must have a minimum of 10 points under
           paragraphs 1 to 15 of Appendix B.

           (d) The applicant must have a minimum of 10 points under
           paragraphs 1 to 2 of Appendix C.

           ...

            (i) the applicant genuinely:

           (1) intends and is able to establish, take over or become a
           director of one or more businesses in the UK within the next six
           months, or

           (2) has established, taken over or become a director of one or
           more businesses in the UK and continues to operate that business
           or businesses; and

           (ii) the applicant genuinely intends to invest the money
           referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A in the business or
           businesses referred to in (i);

           (iii) that the money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A is
           genuinely available to the applicant, and will remain available
           to him until such time as it is spent by his business or
           businesses. 'Available to him' means that the funds are:

           ...

           (3) available from the third party or parties named in the
           application under the terms of the declaration(s) referred to in
           paragraph 41-SD(b) of Appendix A;



      And those requirements  are  further  identified  in  Appendix  A,  at
      paragraph 41, which, again, I reproduce only so far as is relevant:


           41. An applicant will only be considered to have access to funds
           if:

           (a) The specified documents in paragraph 41-SD are provided to
           show cash money to the amount required (this must not be in the
           form of assets);

           (b) The specified documents in paragraph 41-SD are provided to
           show that the applicant has permission to use the money to
           invest in a business in the UK;

           ...





           41-SD:


           41-SD. The specified documents in Table 4 and paragraph 41 are
           as follows:

           (a) The specified documents to show evidence of the money
           available to invest are one or more of the following specified
           documents:

           (i) A letter from each financial institution holding the funds,
           to confirm the amount of money available to the applicant (or
           the entrepreneurial team if applying under the provisions in
           paragraph 52 of this Appendix). Each letter must:

           ...

           (6) state the applicant's name, and his team partner's name if
           the applicant is applying under the provisions in paragraph 52
           of this Appendix,

   4. Thus the applicants had to establish,  by  producing  the  appropriate
      specified documents, that they had  available  the  sum  mentioned  in
      Table 4, which in their case was �200,000, and that it  was  genuinely
      available to them for the purpose of the enterprise they sought  leave
      to undertake. As they did not have  those  funds  themselves,  in  the
      application form they said  that  a  third  party,  Mr  Mumtaz,  would
      provide that money from his bank  account.  To  establish  that  those
      funds, which did not belong to the  applicants  and  were  not  in  an
      account in their name, was genuinely  available  to  them,  the  rules
      require that a letter from the third party's bank  is  produced  which
      states the applicants' names.


   5. In the decision under challenge the respondent explained why no points
      had been awarded for Attributes:


           "You have stated that you have access to funds of �200,000 being
           made available to you by Mr Nawaz Mumtaz. As evidence  you  have
           provided:


           1. a bank letter from Natwest (inc. statement);
           2. a declaration from Mr Nawaz Mumtaz;
           3. a letter from Mr S. Sikandar Ali Shah.

           However, the bank letter is not acceptable because it  does  not
           state your name  and  the  name  of  your  entrepreneurial  team
           partner, and confirm the amount of money being available to  you
           and your team partner from the third party's funds.

           You have therefore  not  submitted  the  specified  evidence  as
           listed under paragraph 41-SD to establish that you  have  access
           to the funds that you are claiming."

   6. The applicants' case is that they went to the  bank  where  the  third
      party who was funding their proposed  enterprise  had  his  funds  and
      asked the bank to provide them with  a  letter  in  the  form  of  the
      template provided by the respondent that would have ensured  that  all
      the required information was provided. The bank declined to  do  this.
      The bank would (and did) provide a letter  confirming  their  customer
      had the requisite level of funds in his account but  would  not  state
      within that letter the applicants' names nor any confirmation of their
      customer's intention that the funds would be used for the  purpose  of
      the applicant's proposed business venture.

   7. This was a considerable setback for the applicants, because they  knew
      very well that the rules demanded no less than a letter containing all
      that was set out in the template so that their application was  not  a
      promising one, to say the least, if they submitted the letter only  in
      the form that the bank was prepared to issue.

   8. The applicants have produced a copy of the letter that  the  bank  was
      willing to produce, confirming only that the balance  of  the  account
      stood at �253,683.23 as at 6 December 2012, which plainly  established
      that the required sum of �200,000 was  available  to  Mr  Mumtaz,  and
      enclosed with it was a copy of the  bank  statement  relating  to  his
      account demonstrating that the sum of �250,000 had been paid in to his
      account a  few  days  earlier.  However,  what  that  letter  did  not
      establish was that the money was available to the applicants, who were
      not named or otherwise referred to.

   9. The applicants say that they had a legitimate expectation  that  their
      application would succeed,  notwithstanding  the  absence  of  a  bank
      letter containing their names and also confirmation on the part of the
      account holder that the funds were to be made available to them . That
      is because, when Mr Zia telephoned the respondent's help  line  before
      submitting the application, to seek advice on how  to  deal  with  the
      fact that the bank would not provide a letter in the form required, he
      was told by an employee of the respondent, identified as  Wayne,  that
      because the third party's name was on the application,  there  was  no
      need for it also to be on the letter from the bank.

  10. The respondent does not accept that any  legitimate  expectation  that
      the application, which plainly  did  not  comply  with  the  specified
      documentation requirement of the rules, would be  successful  because,
      amongst other  things,  Mr  Zia  had  made  an  earlier  call  to  the
      respondent's help line and had been told by another  employee  of  the
      respondent, identified as David, precisely the opposite, making  clear
      that an application that did not comply with  the  specified  document
      requirements would be considered by a caseworker  but  would  probably
      not succeed.

  11. It emerged during submissions that Mr Zia had not made  just  the  two
      calls to the respondent's helpline, in respect  of  which  transcripts
      are before the Tribunal, but five. Mr Skinner produced  a  handwritten
      note made by Mr Zia which provided details of those five calls:

        a. On 27 November 2012 he spoke to "Rowse  Phillip"  who  confirmed
           that the third party,  presumably  a  reference  to  the  person
           providing the funds, can be from the UK or from  overseas,  "and
           you should provide a letter from the bank";
        b. On 28 November 2012 he spoke to "Steve" about the requirement to
           provide an English language test certificate, who suggested that
           he  provide  a  covering  letter  explaining   that   the   test
           certificate would follow later;
        c. On 4 December 2012 Mr Zia recorded that he called and spoke to a
           Mrs Brown who "transferred my call to the supervisor David".  Mr
           Zia's note continued "David advised me to put a covering  letter
           with your application explaining the  ...  situation  that  bank
           doesn't provide any  letter  then  it  is  for  case  worker  to
           decide.";
        d.  On 6 December Mr Zia spoke  to  Wayne,  and  recorded  "...  he
           confirmed that the bank letter provided by NatWest in their  own
           format is sufficient. He also advised to clarify  the  situation
           to case worker in a covering letter.";
        e. Two calls were made on 12 December 2012 concerning the pragmatic
           arrangements for submitting the application.

  12. Helpfully, the position of the parties has  been  distilled  into  six
      issues, in respect of which both advance submissions, although, as  Mr
      Skinner pointed  out,  it  may  be  more  accurate  to  say  that  the
      respondent took six points against the applicants, which are  set  out
      in the summary grounds of defence, and in his skeleton argument he has
      responded to each of those.

  13. First, the respondent submits that the immigration rules are  made  by
      the Secretary of State and approved by Parliament under s3(2)  of  the
      Immigration Act 1971. In the words of Lord  Hope  in  Odelola  v  SSHD
      [2008] UKHL 25, these are statements of the  respondent's  policy  and
      practice. These are detailed statements by a minister of the Crown  as
      to how the Crown proposes to exercise its executive power.  Responding
      to a point taken by Mr Skinner in his oral submissions, that  it  must
      be remembered that the power to grant leave to remain is conferred not
      by the immigration rules but by statute, Mr Malik draws attention also
      to paragraph 35 of Odelola and to the observation of Lord  Brown  that
      the immigration rules are  statements  of  administrative  policy;  an
      indication of how at any particular time the respondent will  exercise
      her discretion with regard to the grant of leave to enter  or  remain.
      Mr Malik  submits  that  the  only  legitimate  expectation  that  the
      applicants could reasonably have had is that their  application  would
      be decided in line with the Immigration rules in force at the date  of
      the decision: Odelola v SSHD [2008] UKHL 25; Alvi v SSHD  [2012]  UKSC
      33.


  14.  Developing  that  submission,  Mr  Malik  points  to  s3(2)  of   the
      Immigration Act 1971 which requires the respondent to make immigration
      rules and to dicta of Lord Hope in Alvi, at para 33, where he rejected
      the  argument  that  it  was  open  to  the  respondent   to   control
      immigration in a way not covered by the rules in  exercise  of  powers
      under the prerogative. He then points to the mandatory  vocabulary  of
      paragraph 245DD of the rules, that make clear that an application that
      does not meet its requirements is to be refused.

  15. In support of that submission, Mr Malik relies upon R (Thebo)  v  SSHD
      [2013]  EWHC  146  (Admin)  that  being  a  case  concerned  with  the
      provisions  of  paragraph  320(7)  of  the  immigration  rules,  which
      provides that entry clearance or leave to enter is to be refused where
      certain  circumstances  exist,   including   the   making   of   false
      representations in the making of an application or a  previous  breach
      of conditions of leave. The point being made is  that  in  respect  of
      both para 320 and para 245DD the rule provides that  leave  is  to  be
      refused in the circumstances set out. That has to be  reconciled  with
      Mr Skinner's  submission  that  the  respondent  always  has  residual
      discretion to grant leave outside the rules and it would  be  unlawful
      for that discretion to be fettered by a rule or policy.

  16. Mr Skinner submits that Parliament has provided  the  respondent  with
      discretionary powers which should be used where an application  cannot
      meet the strict requirements of the rules, where that is necessary  to
      give effect to  a  legitimate  expectation.  He  draws  attention,  in
      particular, to  R (Munir) v SSHD [2012] UKSC 32, at paragraph  44  per
      Lord Dyson:

           "In my view, it is the 1971 Act itself which is  the  source  of
           the Secretary of State's power to grant leave to enter or remain
           outside the immigration rules. The Secretary of State is given a
           wide discretion under sections 3, 3A, 3B and 3C to  control  the
           grant and refusal of leave to enter or to remain: see paras 4 to
           6 above. The language of these  provisions,  especially  section
           3(1)(b) and (c), could not be wider. They  provide  clearly  and
           without qualification that, where a  person  is  not  a  British
           citizen, he may be given leave to enter or limited or indefinite
           leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.  They  authorise  the
           Secretary of State to grant leave to enter or remain even  where
           leave would not be given under the immigration rules."

      Thus, argues  Mr  Skinner,  the  apparently  mandatory  vocabulary  of
      paragraph 245DD cannot properly be seen as  any  fetter  or  restraint
      upon the grant of leave to a person who fails to meet the requirements
      of the rule.

  17. Second, according to  the  respondent,  the  transcripts  of  the  two
      telephone conversation with Mr Zia,  the  first  with  David  and  the
      second with Wayne, must be considered together. When they are  it  can
      be seen that there is absent the "unambiguous representation,  promise
      or assurance devoid of any relevant qualification" required  before  a
      legitimate expectation can  arise:  Mehmood  (legitimate  expectation)
      [2014] UKUT 00469 (IAC) per McCloskey P. Mr Malik submits that it  can
      be seen from the transcripts of those telephone conversations that  Mr
      Zia was aware of the mandatory requirement of the rules and  there  is
      nothing disclosed by the transcripts  that  could  be  regarded  as  a
      promise that leave would be granted. Mr Zia was told  repeatedly  that
      the decision making was for  the  case  workers,  and  not  for  those
      operating the respondent's telephone help line.  It  is  notable  also
      that, although Mr Zia seeks to rely upon what he was told by Wayne, he
      did not point out to Wayne that he had been told  something  different
      by David just two days earlier.

  18. Mr Skinner's submission on this point  emphasises  the  importance  of
      recognising that each of the telephone conversations were asking about
      different scenarios.  The conversation with David was  concerned  with
      the outcome where the applicants did not submit a bank letter at  all,
      in which case  there  could  be  no  guarantee  of  success  in  their
      application. The  conversation  with  Wayne  was  concerned  with  the
      outcome  if  a  "defective"  letter  was   submitted,   he   providing
      reassurance that what they had done would be sufficient, provided  the
      application was  accompanied  by  a  covering  letter  explaining  the
      position.  Thus the conversation with  Wayne  should  be  accepted  as
      being plainly unambiguous and devoid of qualification such as to  give
      rise to a legitimate expectation of success in the  application,  even
      though it had been disclosed that Mr Zia had been unable to  secure  a
      bank letter in the form required by the rules.

  19. The third issue is the respondent's submission that  it  is  only  the
      respondent and those she authorises to do so that can grant  leave  to
      remain. It cannot be said that the operators at the telephone helpline
      may, as a matter of law make promises that would bind  the  respondent
      in that respect, as David repeatedly made clear to Mr Zia  during  the
      course of the first of those telephone conversations.

  20. It is submitted on the applicant's behalf that  such  an  approach  is
      misconceived. There is no reason in law why an official such as  Wayne
      could not have the  power  to  make  such  representations.  Officials
      within central government departments, such as the  Home  Office,  may
      act  in  their  minister's  name  without  any  formal  delegation  of
      authority: Carltona Ltd v Commissioner for Works [1943] 2 All ER  560.
      Further, the respondent offers no evidence of a lack of authority  for
      Wayne to have made those representations. In any event,  even  if  the
      case be that Wayne had no such delegated authority,  as  a  matter  of
      law, officials without the power to make a representation  will  still
      give rise  to  actionable  legitimate  expectations  if  the  official
      appears to have the power to make it. It is asserted that, here, Wayne
      did appear to have the power to tell Mr Zia that he would  succeed  in
      his application if his name did not appear  on  the  letter  from  the
      bank.

  21.  Fourthly,  the  respondent  submits  that  even  if   the   telephone
      conversations did give rise to a legitimate expectation, which is  not
      admitted, the respondent was still entitled to decide the  application
      in line with the rules  and so to refuse the  applications  because  a
      public authority would not be acting unlawfully in circumstances where
      to adhere to the  relevant  promise  would  be  tantamount  to  acting
      inconsistently with its statutory and public law duty,  which  subject
      of course to her residual; discretion, is to act  in  accordance  with
      the immigration rules.

  22. In support, Mr Malik draws upon the recent decision of  the  Court  of
      Appeal in PF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2015] EWCA  Civ.  PF's  appeal  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal against the decision that he should be deported as
      a foreign criminal was allowed. Because of what  Sir  Stanley  Burnton
      referred to as abject incompetence within the  Home  Office  with  the
      right hand wholly ignorant of the actions of the left hand,  a  letter
      was sent to PF's solicitors stating that in the light  of  the  appeal
      being allowed, he would be  granted  leave  to  remain.  However,  the
      renewed application for permission to appeal was granted and the Upper
      Tribunal subsequently allowed the respondent's appeal and remitted the
      appeal to be  determined  afresh  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  PF's
      submission that he had a legitimate expectation of being granted leave
      to remain, as promised by the  letter  sent  to  his  solicitors,  was
      rejected both by the Upper Tribunal and by the Court of  Appeal,  even
      though PF had been given a clear and unequivocal  representation  that
      he would be  granted  leave  to  remain.  The  reasons  for  that  are
      summarised at paragraph 35 of the judgment:


        a) The Secretary of State's representations were made  entirely  in
           error. Where the court is satisfied that a mistake was made,  it
           should be slow to fix the public authority permanently with  the
           consequences of the error: R  v  Department  for  Education  and
           Employment ex parte Begbie [2000] 1 WLR 115 at 1127B-D.


        b) The information that the Secretary of State wished to pursue her
           appeal must have disappointed  the  Appellant  and  his  family.
           However,  the  expectation  engendered  by  the  representations
           cannot have lasted more than 9 days....


        c) There was no evidence of detrimental reliance on  the  Secretary
           of State's representations.


        d)  There  is  a  strong  public  interest  in  the  issue  of  the
           Appellant's deportation being decided on its merits.


  23. In response Mr Skinner points out that as the Court  of  Appeal  found
      that the Upper  Tribunal  should  not  have  addressed  the  issue  of
      legitimate expectation at all, all that the Court of Appeal went on to
      say about that is obiter and, in any event,  the  two  cases  are  not
      analogous as PF was concerned with deportation of a  foreign  criminal
      which generates more cogent issues of public interest  than  does  the
      grant of leave to two would be entrepreneurs.

  24. The applicant disagrees with the respondent's analysis  on  the  basis
      that the respondent has a power under the  Immigration  Act  19071  to
      grant leave but a duty to grant leave where the  requirements  of  the
      rules are met. There is no duty to refuse leave where they are not.

  25. Fifthly, the respondent  submits  that  there  was  no  unfairness  in
      refusing the application in circumstances where the bank had  declined
      to provide a letter in the form required. It is established by Durrani
      (Entrepreneurs: bank  letters;  evidential  flexibility)  [2014]  UKUT
      00295 that:

           "There is no difficulty  in  the  third  party  bank,  with  its
           customer's consent, expressing its understanding, based  on  the
           customer's instructions, that the use of specified funds in  the
           customer's bank account/s is contemplated  or  proposed  by  the
           customer for the purpose of financing the  applicant's  proposed
           business venture. Accordingly, there  is  no  substance  in  the
           argument that the relevant requirements contained  in  paragraph
           41-SD(a)(i) produce an absurd result  and  must,  therefore,  be
           interpreted in some other manner."

  26. On the other hand, the applicant's submission is that neither  Durrani
      nor the subsequent view recently expressed by the Court of  Appeal  in
      Iqbal v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 169 establishes any principle of law that
      it is not open to the applicants to  argue  that  is  was  simply  not
      possible for them to comply with the rules, that being a  question  of
      fact in each case. In this case  there  was  evidence  from  the  bank
      itself that they would not provide a letter in the format suggested by
      the respondent and would not include in their letter  the  information
      the respondent sought. Therefore  it  is  unfair  not  to  uphold  and
      enforce the representation made.


  27. Finally, the respondent points out that  failure  to  provide  a  bank
      letter containing all the required information was not the only reason
      for refusal. The second appellant, Mr Zubair, has  failed  to  provide
      the  English  language  certificate.  Although  he   stated   in   the
      application that he would submit the certificate,  he  has  still  not
      done so. Therefore, the application fell to be refused on  that  basis
      alone.

  28. In  response,  the  applicants  point  out  that  the  effect  of  the
      respondent's own guidance is that the respondent  should  have  waited
      for the result of the second  applicant's  test  before  refusing  the
      application. As required by that policy guidance, the second applicant
      had informed the respondent of the date of his test and the respondent
      should not have determined the application until then. In  any  event,
      even if that remained  a  difficulty,  it  would  man  only  that  the
      application of the second appellant would fall to be refused for  that
      reason.

Analysis

  29. Thus, what is in issue is whether the telephone  conversation  between
      Mr Zia and Wayne  on  the  respondent's  help  line  gave  rise  to  a
      substantive legitimate  expectation.  The  law  relating  to  this  is
      settled. There must be a representation or  promise  which  is  clear,
      unambiguous and devoid of relevant qualification (per Bingham LJ in  R
      v Inland Revenue Commissioners ex p MFK  Underwriting  Agents  Limited
      [1990] 1 WLR 1545 at 1569, approved by Lord Hoffmann in R (Bancoult) v
      Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) [2009]
      1 AC 453. Where appropriate, as it certainly  is  in  this  case,  the
      court must carry out what was described in R (Coughlan)  v  North  and
      Eat Devon Health Authority [2001] QB 213 as:


           "... a detailed examination of the precise terms of the  promise
           or representation made, the circumstances in which  the  promise
           was made and the nature of the statutory or other discretion."


  30. I shall address each of the six issues identified above. Before  doing
      so it is necessary to examine the transcripts of the two of  Mr  Zia's
      two telephone calls to the respondent's helpline that we do have,  the
      first with David and the second with Wayne.

  31. Mr Zia called the helpline on 4 December 2012 and spoke to David. This
      was a relatively lengthy conversation with 21  exchanges  between  the
      parties to this conversation.

  32. Two matters of significance might be noted at the outset.  First,  the
      conversation began with Mr Zia asking to  whom  he  was  speaking  and
      David providing his name and telling Mr Zia that he was a  Supervisor.
      Thus, it was made clear from the outset to Mr Zia that he was speaking
      with a person with experience and a level  of  authority  over  others
      providing the helpline service. Secondly, it appears  that  there  had
      been an earlier call because, after  Mr  Zia  explained  that  he  was
      seeking advice about the refusal of the bank to provide  a  letter  in
      the form required by the rules, David said:

           "My colleague, I believe, told you that without that there is no
           guarantee that the application will be completed because that is
           one of the requirements on the form."

      He then suggested  that  if  the  applicant  could  put  in  a  letter
      explaining why he could not provide a bank letter in the required form
      but added that:


           ... but it will be down to the  caseworker  whether  they  would
           accept that or not."

      As the telephone conversation continued, Mr  Zia  repeatedly  observed
      that he was not able to provide what was required and repeatedly asked
      what he should do, this generating a consistent line of response  from
      David, including the following:


           "We  don't  make  the  rules,  Sir,  we  are  only  a  telephone
           department. We only pass information on  as  it's  said  on  the
           website. On the website is the rules and  they  are  made  by  a
           higher authority than us. If you cannot comply  with  the  rules
           then there is no guarantee that the application will be taken or
           will be successful."


           "... All that we can do is advise you as  to  what  the  current
           details are on the website and that is all we can do..."


           " There is nothing we can do about that I do appreciate what you
           are saying but it is down to the bank if the bank won't  provide
           it the only thing you can do is to put  a  letter  in  when  you
           submit your application and it is down to the caseworker if they
           won't accept it because that is one of the standard requirements
           if the bank  won't  provide  it  then  I  cannot  see  what  the
           caseworker will do it is down to them at  the  end  of  the  day
           whether they will accept this or not."


           "... It would be down to the caseworker to  decide  if  that  is
           sufficient or not. We can't say what the caseworker will say  it
           will be down to them they  are  the  ones  who  make  the  final
           decision."


           " I cannot say so we cannot say what the caseworker will  decide
           we are not in  a  position  on  that  one  it  is  down  to  the
           caseworker if they decide that it falls to rejection  then  they
           will write out giving the reason why..."


      At one point in the conversation Mr Zia asked David if there had  been
      cases that had overcome such a problem. David replied:


           " Well I wouldn't know Sir because we are not caseworkers..."


      Although  by  this  point  in  the  conversation,   David   had   made
      unambiguously clear that no assurance at all could be  given  that  Mr
      Zia's explanation for not submitting  a  rules-compliant  bank  letter
      would be acceptable, Mr Zia persisted in asking if he  might  succeed,
      saying:


           "So what do  you  hope  they  would,  I  prepare  this  with  my
           solicitor so do you hope its successful?"


      To which David replied:


           "I don't know Sir I cannot say it is the  caseworker  who  makes
           the decision we do not make any decisions we cannot  advise  you
           as to what their decision may be it is for  the  caseworker  the
           caseworker is the person who will decide we would not  be  in  a
           position to give you any advice as to what they may or  may  not
           say."

  33. And so it continued. It can  be  seen  from  the  transcript  of  that
      telephone conversation that David said no less than 15 times  that  it
      was the caseworker who would  decide  the  application  and  he  said,
      repeatedly, that he could not predict the outcome because all he could
      do was to provide the information that was on the website.


  34. The next telephone call to the help line was with  Wayne,  this  being
      the one relied upon by the applicants, and was made two days later  on
      6 December 2012. This was a more brief conversation, as  is  indicated
      by the fact that the transcript runs to two pages, compared with the 5
      page long transcript of the call to David. Mr Zia explained  that  the
      bank had refused to issue a  letter  concerning  his  uncle's  account
      which contained the names of him and his entrepreneurial  team  member
      and he asked what he should do. Wayne said:

           "... If your sponsor's name is  on  your  application  as  third
           party then obviously you don't need."

  35. Turning to the first of  the  issues  identified  by  the  parties  as
      discussed above, the  respondent  submits  that  the  only  legitimate
      expectation that the applicants could have is that their  applications
      be decided in line with the immigration rules in force at the time  of
      the decision. On the other hand, the applicants  rely  upon  the  fact
      that while the respondent has a duty  to  grant  an  application  that
      meets the requirements of the rules she has a power, or discretion, to
      allow one that does not and so no duty to  refuse  it.  That,  however
      takes no account of the mandatory vocabulary of  the  applicable  rule
      which is 245DD which provides, with emphasis added:

           "To qualify for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)
           Migrant under this rule, an applicant must meet the requirements
           listed below. If the applicant meets these requirements, leave
           to remain will be granted. If the applicant does not meet these
           requirements, the application will be refused."


  36. Thus the starting point is that the  applicants  have  an  expectation
      from the rule under which they are applying for leave that if they  do
      not meet the requirements  of  the  rule  their  application  will  be
      refused. There can be no doubt at all that the appellants  were  aware
      of that because it was the recognition that  they  could  not  provide
      what was required by the rule that gave rise to the decision  that  Mr
      Zia should call the helpline to discuss what if anything could be done
      to overcome the difficulty they had encountered.

  37. Mr Zia's telephone conversation with David left no room for  doubt  or
      ambiguity about the position or about the scope of  the  authority  of
      those who could be spoken to on the helpline. It  is  of  significance
      that Mr Zia's call to the helpline was transferred  to  David  by  the
      member of staff he first spoke to because she thought he should  speak
      to a supervisor. The first thing David did was to identify himself  as
      a supervisor.

  38. Thus, when Mr Zia spoke to Wayne two days  later  he  was  aware  that
      those he spoke to on the helpline could not make decisions as that was
      a matter for the caseworker. He had also been  told  in  the  clearest
      possible terms by David that a person dealing with an enquiry  on  the
      helpline could do no more than pass on information that was  available
      on the website and could not predict the outcome of an application.

  39. He knew also that he had been told those things by a supervisor.

  40. When Mr Zia spoke to Wayne he had no reason at  all  to  believe  that
      Wayne had authority to depart from the role of the helpline  staff  as
      it had been so clearly described to him by  the  supervisor  two  days
      before. Nor did he have any reason to  believe  that  the  information
      provided by David no  longer  held  good.  Since  it  was  immediately
      apparent that the  information  he  was  given  by  Wayne  was  wholly
      different from and irreconcilable with  the  information  provided  by
      David, it would be reasonable to expect, if Mr Zia wished to rely upon
      what Wayne was now saying, that he would have disclosed the  gist,  at
      least, of what he had previously been told. That would  have  provided
      an opportunity to clarify the position.

  41. Put another way, an individual who seeks protection  of  a  legitimate
      expectation must himself deal fairly with  the  public  authority  and
      that means making proper disclosure of any relevant matter,  which  in
      this context clearly includes the apparently contradictory information
      he had received.

  42. Mr Skinner submits that the two conversations  were  wholly  different
      because when Mr Zia spoke to David it was concerning an enquiry of the
      consequences of submitting no bank letter at all with his  application
      but when he spoke with Wayne it was in relation to an enquiry about  a
      bank letter that fell short of meeting all  the  requirements  of  the
      rule.

  43. But that distinction,  even  if  accepted,  takes  the  applicants  no
      further forward at all. It cannot sensibly be suggested that all David
      had said about the final decision being for the case  worker  to  make
      and that a call to the helpline could not provide a prediction of  the
      outcome of an  application  applied  only  where  an  application  was
      submitted unaccompanied by a specified document.

  44. Thus, after the calls Mr Zia had conflicting information. He knew that
      the requirement to meet the conditions of the rules was mandatory  and
      that the rule made clear that the application would be refused  if  he
      did not do so. He knew that David had made clear that it was the  case
      worker who would decide the outcome and not the help  line  staff.  On
      the other hand, Wayne had said something different.  Mr  Zia  did  not
      disclose that to Wayne. I do not accept those circumstances gave  rise
      to any legitimate expectation that everything else must yield  to  the
      view  expressed  by  Wayne.  The  appellants   are   intelligent   and
      resourceful young men who proposed to invest a large sum of money in a
      new business enterprise. For them to  believe  that  they  could  rely
      solely upon what Wayne had said means that they must have felt able to
      disregard everything else that had occurred. I do not accept they  did
      so and nor it was not open to them to selectively seek to do so.

  45. In any event, there is another  route  to  the  same  conclusion.  The
      information provided by Wayne was plainly  incorrect.  The  applicants
      knew that was probably the case because of what  David  had  said  and
      that was confirmed when refusal of their application was notified  not
      much later. There is no indication  that  there  was  any  detrimental
      reliance upon the incorrect information provided by Wayne because  the
      applicants had already established, unambiguously, that they would not
      be able to provide a bank letter in a qualifying form. Finally,  there
      is a strong public interest in the outcome of such applications  being
      decided in a consistent and predictable way, in line  with  the  clear
      statement of policy as set out in  the  Immigration  Rule  applicable.
      That indicates that each of the matters identified in PF as  providing
      an answer to the question posed  where  a  legitimate  expectation  is
      asserted are present here also.

  46. For these reasons I have no doubt at all that the applicants  did  not
      have a legitimate expectation that their application would be granted,
      such that the respondent was bound to  do  so,  notwithstanding  their
      inability to meet the requirement of the rules. That may be sufficient
      to dispose of the application. But  I  will  also  address  the  other
      issues raised.

  47. Mr Skinner is correct  to  say  that  the  power  to  grant  leave  is
      conferred not by  the  rules  but  by  primary  legislation.  But  the
      obligation to make the rules arises also from primary legislation  and
      the fact that the respondent retains an area of  discretion  to  grant
      leave to those who do not meet the requirements of the rules is not in
      itself  reason  to  depart  from  the  mandatory  vocabulary  of  this
      particular rule which, unlike some others tells the applicant that the
      application will be refused if all the requirements are not met.  That
      does not mean that the determination  of  applications  in  accordance
      with those rules is a fetter upon the discretion of the respondent  to
      grant leave in any particular case. The problem for  these  applicants
      was that there was no reason at all for  the  respondent  to  exercise
      such discretion outside the rules.

  48. As I am satisfied that  the  applicants  did  not  have  a  legitimate
      expectation that the information provided  by  Wayne  would  not  only
      displace the information provided previously by a supervisor but would
      also, contrary to what Mr Zia had been told, bind  the  caseworker  to
      grant the application, it matters not whether Wayne should be regarded
      as having any form of ostensible authority to do so,  although  in  my
      judgement the only rational conclusion that could be reached,  in  the
      light of what David had said to Mr Zia, is that neither he nor  anyone
      else to whom the applicants may have spoken to on the  help  line  had
      any authority at all to give any assurance as to  the  outcome  of  an
      application.

  49. As for what might be described as the  Durani  point,  the  fact  that
      these applicants have produced a letter from  their  banks  confirming
      refusal to issue a letter in the form requested does  not  assist  the
      applicants in respect of the single ground upon which  permission  has
      been granted. In any event, it is not established that no applicant is
      able to provide such a letter, simply that these two  applicants  have
      been unable to do so. If it were the universal practice  of  banks  to
      decline such requests, whatever the circumstances of  the  account  in
      question and the movement of funds into  and  out  of  them,  then  no
      applicant relying upon funding provided by third parties holding their
      funds in a United Kingdom Bank would ever be able to comply  with  the
      requirements of the rules and there is no  evidence  offered  to  that
      effect.

  50. In the light of these conclusions,  it  is  not  necessary  to  decide
      whether the fact that Mr Zubair has  still  not  provided  an  English
      language test certificate is fatal to one or both of the  applications
      because both fall to be refused in any event because they did not meet
      the Specified  Document  requirements  and  there  was  no  legitimate
      expectation that excused them from the need to do so.

Conclusion

  51. The applications of both applicants for judicial review are refused.
