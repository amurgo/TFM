Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr D Olawanle, Del & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenny, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The first Appellant is a national of Ghana born on 19 June  1973.   The
    second Appellant is his wife born on 7 November 1977 and they have  two
    children, the third Appellant born on 21 October 2009  and  the  fourth
    Appellant born on 24 July 2013.

 2. They appeal against a decision by the Respondent dated 23 January  2017
    refusing their applications for leave to remain on the basis  of  their
    private and family life.  The Appellants appealed against that decision
    and their appeal came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Rayner
    for hearing on 13 April 2018.

 3. In a decision and reasons  promulgated  on  20  June  2018,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal, essentially on the basis that the best  interests
    of the third Appellant, who was a qualifying child, were outweighed  by
    the public  interest,  bearing  in  mind  that  the  first  and  second
    Appellants are overstayers.

 4. The Appellants sought permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,  in
    time, on the basis that the judge had erred in  law  in  concluding  it
    would be reasonable to remove a child who would be 9 years old  shortly
    and had always lived in the UK, even when it  was  not  in  the  public
    interest to remove her.  Reference was  made  to  the  fact  the  first
    Appellant runs a charity turning over about ï¿½900,000 a  year  attending
    to the underprivileged in society and that this charity would  collapse
    if he were to be removed.

 5. It was submitted that proper regard was not had to section  117B(6)  of
    the NIAA 2002 and the policy guidance of the Respondent, and  that  the
    judge misdirected herself in respect of the judgment  of  Lord  Justice
    Elias in MA Pakistan [2016] EWCA Civ 705 at [19], [20], [36],  [44]  to
    [46], [49], [52] to [53] and [100] to [104].

 6. Permission to appeal was granted upon renewal to the Upper Tribunal  in
    a decision dated 29 November 2018 by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Pitt  who
    held:

         "It is arguable  that  the  FtTJ  took  a  wrong  approach  in  the
         assessment of whether it was reasonable  for  the  older  child  to
         leave the UK, KO Nigeria [2018] UKSC 53 considered.

         All grounds are arguable".

     Hearing

 7. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, Mr Olawanle sought to rely on
    the grounds of appeal and essentially  reiterated  what  was  contained
    therein.  He submitted that the judge had not  struck  a  fair  balance
    when bearing in mind the Appellant had set  up  a  successful  charity,
    insufficient weight had been attached to the positive  contribution  of
    the Appellants who are contributing to the economic  wellbeing  of  the
    country.  He submitted it was not in the best interests of the children
    to go to Ghana given the absence of their parents for  many  years  and
    the balance had not been struck fairly or  properly  thus  it  will  be
    unreasonable or unduly harsh.

 8. In her submissions on behalf of the Secretary of State, Ms Kenny stated
    that she struggled to see where the judge had gone wrong.  The decision
    was thorough and well balanced and the submissions to the contrary were
    simply a disagreement with the judge's findings of fact.

 9. At [22] the judge noted in respect of the charity that no  testimonials
    had been provided as to the work done, the evidence was entirely  based
    on what the Appellants had said and there  was  no  evidence  that  the
    charity will be dismantled if they had to leave.

10. At [26] in respect of the eldest child, there were good school  reports
    and good progress had been made by her, but it was  not  suggested  she
    was at a particularly important stage of her education.  She can  speak
    English, she has no medical conditions and at [27] the  judge  examined
    her situation in further detail.  She had no significant needs and  her
    education and healthcare can be provided for and met in Ghana.

11. Ms Kenny submitted the judge considered  all  the  relevant  points  in
    order to arrive  at  her  conclusion,  in  particular  that  the  third
    Appellant's parents are familiar with the customs and culture of Ghana.
     They are financially  stable,  well  educated,  highly  adaptable  and
    resourceful and will be able to set up something akin as to  what  they
    have done here in the UK in Ghana.

12. At [45]  whilst  it  was  marginally  in  the  third  Appellant's  best
    interests to remain in the UK, this does not mean it is not  reasonable
    for her to leave and at [47] in respect of the fact that  the  children
    have no experience of Ghana, she submitted the  judge  found  that  the
    public interest trumps the Appellants' case.  She  submitted  that  the
    judge's decision was in accordance with the judgment  in  KO  (Nigeria)
    [2018] UKSC 53, as the judge had considered all the  factors  affecting
    the child's integration.

13. I put to both parties the judgment of Lord Justice Elias in MA Pakistan
    [2016] EWCA Civ 705, particularly at [49] where he held

         "The fact that the child has been in the UK for seven  years  would
         need to be given significant weight in a  proportionality  exercise
         for two  related  reasons:  first,  because  of  its  relevance  to
         determining the nature and strength of the child's  best  interests
         and second, because it establishes as a starting point  that  leave
         should  be  granted  unless  there  are  powerful  reasons  to  the
         contrary".

14. I pointed out the judge had not considered this aspect of the  judgment
    when assessing the reasonableness of expecting the third  Appellant  to
    return, having at  [45] only considered [47] and [48].  My question was
    whether this is still good law in light of the judgment of the  Supreme
    Court in KO (op cit). Ms Kenny  submitted  that  [47]  of  MA  Pakistan
    clearly ties in with KO (Nigeria). Mr Olawanle submitted there were  no
    powerful reasons which would prevent the Appellants from being  granted
    leave in the UK apart from the overstay.  He sought to  rely  on  pages
    224 to 275 and 276 to 287 regarding the charity.

     Findings and Reasons

15. I find a material error of law in the decision of Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Rayner and  that  is  the  failure  to  fully  apply  the
    judgment of Lord Justice Elias in MA Pakistan (op cit), despite  citing
    the relevant extract from his Lordship's judgment at [47] and  [48]  at
    [45] of her decision, viz: "The fact that a child  has  been  here  for
    seven years must be given significant  weight  when  carrying  out  the
    proportionality exercise.  Indeed  the  Secretary  of  State  published
    guidance in August 2015 in the  form  of  the  Immigration  Directorate
    Instructions entitled family life as a partner or  parent  and  private
    life ten year routes, in which it is expressly  stated  that  once  the
    seven years' residence  requirement  is  satisfied  there  need  to  be
    'strong reasons' for refusing leave (11.2.4).  After such a  period  of
    time the child will have put down roots and developed social,  cultural
    and educational links in the UK such that it is  likely  to  be  highly
    disruptive if the child is required to leave the UK.  That may be  less
    so when the children are very young because the focus  of  their  lives
    will be on their families but the disruption becomes  more  serious  as
    they get older.  Moreover in these cases there must be  a  very  strong
    expectation that the child's best interests will be to remain in the UK
    with his parents as part of a family unit  and  that  must  rank  as  a
    primary consideration in a proportionality assessment".

16. Whilst the Home Office guidance has subsequently been updated,  I  find
    that the principles set out in MA Pakistan have neither been overturned
    nor are inconsistent with the judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  KO
    Nigeria and Others [2018] UKSC 53, which was  in  any  event  primarily
    concerned with the issue of whether, when considering whether  it  will
    be unduly harsh for a child of a foreign  national  criminal  to  leave
    pursuant to section 117C(5), the Tribunal is concerned  only  with  the
    position of the child and not with the immigration history and  conduct
    of the parents or any  wider  public  interest  factors  in  favour  of
    removal [23].

17. Whilst the judgment of Lord Justice Elias in MA Pakistan (op  cit)  was
    before their Lordships in KO (Nigeria), the only  point  taken  was  in
    relation to [40] of the judgment  of  Lord  Justice  Elias,  where  his
    Lordship considered whether the wider approach to reasonableness should
    be adopted, which is not the point in issue before me.  It is  apparent
    from the evidence and from the judge's findings  that  the  only  issue
    relied upon in respect of the public interest was  the  fact  that  the
    Appellants have an unlawful or precarious immigration status.

18. The judge at [53]  accepted  with  reference  to  the  public  interest
    considerations which she set out at [52] that all the Appellants  speak
    English as their primary language,  they  are  financially  independent
    with reference to section 117B(3) but little weight could be  given  to
    their private life as it was established whilst they were  here  either
    unlawfully or precariously.

19. In respect of Section 117B(6) the judge found that the third  Appellant
    was a qualifying child but relied on her reasons previously provided at
    [49] in respect of 276ADE(iv) of the Immigration Rules that it would be
    reasonable for her to return.

20. I find when considering the issue of the reasonableness  of  the  third
    Appellant's return, the judge fell into error at [48],  in  that  while
    she  considered  the  judgment  in  Zoumbas  [2013]  UKSC  74  and   EV
    Philippines [2014]  EWCA  Civ  874,  the  judge  did  not  consider  MA
    (Pakistan) in respect of that assessment.

21. In light of the Home Office guidance which was adopted by Lord  Justice
    Elias at [49] of MA (Pakistan), I find thus that the  judge  materially
    erred in law.  In the  absence  of  powerful  reasons  or  very  strong
    reasons, which are defined in the Home Office guidance as a  very  poor
    immigration history or criminality, etc. and in light  of  the  judge's
    finding at [41] that the first Appellant's immigration history is poor,
    I find that the word very is not mere surplusage.

22.  The parties agreed that, were I to find a  material  error  of  law  I
    should re-make the decision based on a consideration of the papers.

23. The relevant Home Office guidance was updated on 23  January  2019,  to
    reflect the judgment in KO (Nigeria). Consideration  of  the  issue  of
    reasonableness is set out at [68]-[70], however, there is no  reference
    therein to the judgment in MA (Pakistan). As set out above,  I  do  not
    consider that the judgment in KO (Nigeria) has replaced the judgment of
    Lord Justice Elias in MA (Pakistan) not least because  the  appeal  was
    brought on a different factual basis and their Lordships simply did not
    address that issue. Thus I do not find  the  guidance  in  its  current
    manifestation to be of particular assistance.

24. Whilst it is  not  disputed  that  the  first  Appellant  has  been  an
    overstayer  since  30  November  2004  and  the  second  Appellant  has
    overstayed  since  7  August  2008,  no  other  adverse  factors   were
    identified by the Respondent in  the  refusal  decision  nor  were  any
    identified during the appeal hearing or in  the  Judge's  decision  and
    reasons. Consequently, I find that there is an absence of the types  of
    behaviour such as criminality, or a very poor immigration history, that
    would amount to very strong reasons rendering  removal  of  the  family
    proportionate cf. MT and ET (child's best interests; ex tempore pilot)
    Nigeria [2018] UKUT 00088 (IAC) at [33]-[34].

25. I adopt the reasoning of Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer in SR (subsisting
    parental relationship - s117B(6))  Pakistan  [2018]  UKUT  00334  (IAC)
    where she held:

         "55. The proper application of section 117B(6) when resolved in an
         individual's favour is determinative of the issue of
         proportionality. As Sales LJ made clear in Rhuppiah v SSHD [2016]
         EWCA Civ 803, [2016] 1 WLR 4204 at [45], sections 117A-117D of the
         2002 Act provide a structured approach to the application of
         Article 8 which produces in all cases a "final result" compatible
         with Article 8. Where Parliament has declared that the public
         interest does not require a person's removal in specified
         circumstances, and those circumstances are present, that is the end
         of the matter."


26. I substitute a decision allowing the appeal, on the basis that it would
    not be reasonable to expect the third Appellant, who  is  a  qualifying
    child, to leave the United Kingdom. Thus the  requirements  of  section
    117B(6) of the NIAA 2002 are met  and  the  public  interest  does  not
    require removal of this family unit.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
