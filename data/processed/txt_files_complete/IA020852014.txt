                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Before the Upper Tribunal  the  Secretary  of  State  now  becomes  the
    appellant.  However, for the avoidance of confusion, I  shall  continue
    to refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. At the commencement of the hearing before me there was no appearance by
    or on behalf of the appellant.  Notice of the hearing had been sent  to
    him at his last recorded address in Nottingham on 9th July 2014 and had
    not been returned in the post.  In  these  circumstances  I  considered
    that it was in the interests of justice to proceed with the hearing  in
    the absence of the appellant applying the provisions of paragraph 38 of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Background

 3. On 11th June  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Clayton  gave
    permission to the respondent to appeal  against  the  determination  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ferguson who, in a brief determination
    sent out on 1st May 2014, allowed the appeal on the papers against  the
    decision of the respondent to refuse further leave to remain as a  Tier
    4 (General) Student Migrant in accordance with the points-based system.



 4. Judge Clayton noted that  the  grounds  asserted  that  the  judge  had
    considered evidence which was not submitted in support of  and  at  the
    time of making the leave application contrary to  the  requirements  of
    Section 85A(4)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.



 5. The appellant's application to the respondent had  been  made  on  30th
    October 2013 yet  the  judge  had  referred,  in  paragraph  4  of  the
    determination, to an affidavit, a bank statement and  a  family  record
    book all of which had been submitted after  the  application  had  been
    made.  In reaching the conclusion  that  the  appellant  satisfied  the
    requirements of the Rules the judge had taken all of this evidence into
    consideration when it was not admissible.

 6. Mr McVeety confirmed  that  the  respondent  relied  upon  the  grounds
    reminding me that the decision of the Court of Appeal in Raju  and  Ors
    [2013] EWCA Civ 754 made it clear that  the  concept  of  a  continuing
    application under the Rules was wrong and that an application was  made
    when paragraph 34G of the Rules states it is made.

 7. After considering the matter for a few moments I announced that  I  was
    satisfied that the determination showed a material error on a point  of
    law such that  it  should  be  re-made.   That  is  because  the  brief
    determination shows that  the  judge  allowed  the  appeal  because  of
    information provided by the appellant well after  his  application  was
    made contrary to the provisions of section 85A of  the  2002  Act.   On
    that basis the application had been properly refused by the respondent.

Re-making the Determination

 8. Mr McVeety urged me to re-make the  appeal  by  dismissing  it  as  the
    decision of the respondent on 16th December 2013 was  right.   In  that
    decision the respondent had awarded no  points  to  the  appellant  for
    maintenance (funds) as he had failed to show that he was in  possession
    of the total of �11,200 required for a consecutive  28  day  period  to
    meet the requirement for living costs of �1,600 and outstanding  course
    fees of �9,600.  The bank evidence submitted only showed a  balance  of
    �390.45 during the relevant 28 day period from 3rd October 2013 to 30th
    October 2013.

 9. I informed Mr McVeety that  I  would  dismiss  the  appeal.   That  was
    because I was satisfied that the subsequent evidence submitted  by  the
    appellant did not fall within the  exceptional  provisions  of  Section
    85A(4) of the 2002 Act because the evidence  subsequently  produced  by
    the appellant was not adduced to prove that a document was  genuine  or
    valid or that it related to grounds other than those specified in  sub-
    Section (3)(c) of the Section.  The  appellant  had  produced  evidence
    relating to funds held overseas  by  the  appellant's  mother.   To  be
    admissible such evidence should have  been  produced  at  the  time  of
    application but was not.

10. The grounds of appeal before the First-tier Judge pointed out that  the
    appellant had been studying in the United Kingdom for five  years  and,
    if returned to Morocco, would waste the  money  he  had  paid  for  his
    education.  These comments do not, however, give rise  to  an  arguable
    Article 8 claim based on private life.  But even if  they  did  I  have
    regard to the provisions of paragraph 117B of the 2002 Act (inserted by
    Section 19 of the Immigration Act  2014)  which  requires  me  to  give
    little weight to private life established by a person at  a  time  when
    his immigration status was "precarious".  In this  case  the  appellant
    had leave as a student  for  the  limited  purpose  of  continuing  his
    education.

DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shows an error on  a  point  of
law such that  it  should  be  re-made.   I  re-make  the  determination  by
dismissing it on immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order nor  do  I  consider
one to be appropriate, now.
