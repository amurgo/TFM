Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Rahman, instructed by AR Immigration Services
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Officer Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 8th  August  1988  and
    she appeals against the decision of the respondent dated 25th  November
    2012 to refuse her entry clearance to the UK further to  paragraph  281
    of the Immigration Rules.

 2. The reasons for  refusal  set  out  that  there  had  been  a  previous
    application  made  by  the  appellant,  which  was  refused,  and  then
    determined on appeal by Immigration Judge Davis who  found  that  there
    was no credible evidence of the sponsor's circumstances and  employment
    and found that it was wholly unbelievable that the sponsor was employed
    as claimed and dismissed  the  appeal.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    stated that the appellant had still not  satisfactorily  addressed  the
    reasons for the previous refusal and there was still no  evidence  that
    the sponsor's previous employment arrangements were  as  claimed.   The
    Entry Clearance Officer expected the appellant to provide  evidence  to
    dispute the claims made by the judge and this indicated the  judge  was
    previously correct which  seriously  damaged  the  credibility  of  the
    sponsor and the  appellant.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  therefore
    assessed the statement and documents in the application  with  caution.
    In  the  event  the  application  was  refused  on  the  basis  of  the
    relationship,  in  relation  to  accommodation  and  on  the  basis  of
    maintenance.

 3. In the event the circumstances as to the relationship and accommodation
    were accepted by the Entry Clearance Manager and  the  remaining  issue
    was maintenance.

 4. The reasons for refusal stated that in the application the sponsor  was
    working as a waiter for Minar & Shefa Enterprise Ltd since 1st February
    2012 earning �800 a month.  The appellant had submitted  an  employment
    letter from India Night restaurant confirming the sponsor's  employment
    but this was undated and not on  headed  paper.   Also  submitted  were
    twelve payslips but all of the salary slips showed the exact amount  of
    net pay being �200 and this did not appear to be  credible  bearing  in
    mind the variability and the change of tax  payable  each  month.   The
    salary slips stated that he was paid by cash  making  it  difficult  to
    confirm such payments  and  there  was  no  reliable  evidence  of  any
    national insurance contributions or that  the  claimed  employment  was
    registered with a local  Inland  Revenue  office.   Further  there  was
    nothing to suggest the sponsor had ever  been  employed  in  the  field
    before or that  he  had  any  qualifications.   The  doubts  about  his
    previous claimed employment and the lack of  independent  corroboratory
    evidence of this employment led the Entry Clearance  Officer  to  doubt
    that he was genuinely employed.

 5. Further the bank statements submitted as evidence  showed  no  payments
    that corresponded with income and no evidence of the  origin  of  funds
    contained.  The Entry Clearance Officer could not be  satisfied  as  to
    the provenance of these  funds  or  that  the  money  was  an  accurate
    reflection of his current financial position or that the funds would be
    available to adequately allow him and the  appellant  to  maintain  and
    accommodate themselves.

 6. Following a hearing First-tier Tribunal Judge Obhi dismissed the appeal
    on 19th February 2014.

Application for Permission to Appeal

 7. It was asserted by the appellant that the judge first stated that there
    were material differences between the first visa  application  and  the
    second, but then went on to use the first as  her  starting  point  and
    referenced the  appellant's  lack  of  credibility.   She  referred  to
    Appendix FM and referred  to  the  evidence  required  thereunder.  She
    interpreted the P60 and P45 as generated by employer and not the  HMRC.
    These are submitted to the HMRC and no further verification  should  be
    required. KA Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065 identified the relevant income
    and expenses standard, and accommodation costs were the  only  relevant
    expense.  The issue of expenses was not raised at the hearing.

 8. First Tier Tribunal Judge Adio granted  permission  to  appeal  and  he
    stated that the judge was wrong to require proof of specified  evidence
    under Appendix FM as this application  pre  dated  the  application  of
    Appendix FM.  The judge accepted that the bank statements showed he was
    earning �200 per week.

The Hearing

 9. Mr Rahman made clear that he relied on his written submissions  and  he
    did not represent the appellant previously.  There had been a  material
    difference in the application since the previous  application.  It  was
    incorrect of the judge to use a law which was not  in  force  and  this
    placed too high a burden on the appellant.

10. Mr Tufan stated that the relevant findings were in paragraph 20 and the
    judge was entitled to come to the decision which she did.

Conclusions

11. It was accepted by the Entry Clearance Manager that evidence  regarding
    accommodation and the relationship satisfied the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

12. Judge Obhi concentrated on the maintenance requirement.  She considered
    the decision of Immigration Judge Davies and noted 'some'  similarities
    although she accepted at paragraph 17 that there were  changes  to  the
    information provided.  She stated at paragraph 17

    "The Immigration Judge  found  the  sponsor's  evidence  to  be  wholly
    unbelievable and therefore made a credibility finding against him.  The
    ECO states that the appellant has provided no  additional  evidence  to
    rebut those findings of unreliability and lack of credibility."

13. Judge Obhi acknowledged that the appellant had produced  evidence  from
    HMRC confirming that he had registered his business  and  offering  him
    tax assistance.  Nonetheless the judge stated that

    'the fact the sponsor was found to lack credibility in that appeal  was
    a factor which I take into  account  and  identified  that  there  were
    similarities in his position now to that which it was then'.

14. The judge  was  entitled  to  make  reference  to  a  previous  judge's
    determination following, Devaseelen [2003] Imm AR 1, in relation to the
    factor of credibility as found on the facts of that application and she
    clearly remarked that there  was  a  difference  in  the  circumstances
    before her. The fact that someone does not appeal does not  necessarily
    mean  that  they  accept  the  contents  of   the   determination   but
    nevertheless the determination of Judge Davies still stands.

15. Judge Obhi found against the appellant in relation to maintenance.  The
    judge was clear "The evidence in relation to the  sponsor's  employment
    remains ambiguous" [20].  She stated that "He has now provided payslips
    from the India Night employment, a P60 and a P45.  These documents  are
    generated by the employer and are not produced by the HMRC".   She  was
    correct in this. The judge  clearly  found  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer had commented on the  unsatisfactory  nature  of  the  evidence
    provided by the appellant and that he needed to obtain some independent
    verification from HMRC about the payment of tax and national insurance.
     The Entry Clearance Officer  and  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  both
    stated that the cash payments were difficult to evidence and there  was
    no evidence to show tax or national insurance payments were being  met.
    The judge referred to this and therefore criticised the evidence on the
    basis that independent verification from HMRC would have  resolved  the
    issue.   The  important  aspect  of  Devaseelen  is  to   decide   each
    application on its own merits and that matters arsing since  the  first
    determination are determined.  That is the  case  here.  There  was  no
    indication that the judge failed to  take  into  account  all  relevant
    material.

16. Immigration Judge Davis's findings, with regard  maintenance,  appeared
    to be in relation to self-employment and whether there was  a  business
    or not, but the appellant was now employed. The appellant  did  produce
    some evidence that  there  had  been  in  the  past  been  a  business.
    Nonetheless the Judge Obhi clearly stated that there was no independent
    evidence from the tax authorities and this was  a  similar  feature  in
    this case.

17. I find that the reference to Appendix FM is merely an example  of  what
    the  evidence  is  required  now  and  although  not  definitive  under
    paragraph 281 is a matter which is open to the judge to have taken into
    account.  She clearly states that she is aware  that  this  is  a  pre-
    change of Rules case.  Once again at  paragraph  20  the  judge  states
    "there is no independent verification of the sponsor's income  in  this
    case".  She states "He  received  his  income  in  cash,  there  is  no
    evidence except the tax documents prepared by the employer in the  form
    of a P60 that the sponsor had actually earned the sums that he claims".
     Indeed the judge states that  the  purpose  of  the  provisions,  i.e.
    paragraph 281 is to ensure that the appellant does not come to  the  UK
    and become dependent on public funds.  She does recorded "I  cannot  be
    sure from the evidence provided by the sponsor that it will not be  the
    case".

18. The judge makes it clear that she is aware that it is not Appendix  FM-
    SE which is being applied.

19. I can appreciate that there was no application of  KA  in  relation  to
    income and expenses but the fact is that the underlying figure  of  the
    appellant's income was not accepted by the judge and on this basis  and
    this basis alone the appeal was rejected.  I note she stated  that  the
    sponsor's bank statements 'more recently show that he is earning  �200'
    but this reference to earning via bank deposits does not undermine  the
    previous findings regarding an overall lack  of  independent  evidence.
    Bank statements are not tax documents confirming earnings and  although
    the judge may have inadvertently referred to the appellant earning this
    does not undermine her finds or confirm indeed that he was employed.

20. Mr  Rahman  quite  rightly  pointed  out  that  it  was  not  him  that
    represented  the  appellant  in  the  previous  matter  and  that   the
    credibility of the appellant should not be the determining factor in an
    appeal.  I do not find that the judge's determination reflected that it
    was.

21. I find that the judge was entitled to  make  reference  to  a  previous
    determination by Judge Davis and in this particular instance appears to
    have assessed the facts afresh  by  assessing  the  evidence  that  was
    produced in the form of payslips from the employment, a P60 and  a  P45
    but nonetheless commented on the lack of tax documentation.  It was not
    just on the lack of credibility from the  previous  assessment  or  the
    previous assessment  of  Judge  Davies  that  the  judge  rejected  the
    appellant's appeal.  She did accept that the documents were different.

22. It may have been an error to make a reference to Appendix FM but it  is
    quite clear at the beginning of the determination where the  judge  set
    out paragraph 281 that she understood the law to  be  applied.   As  Mr
    Rahman pointed out the documentary requirements under Appendix  FM  are
    stringent and it is clear that the judge does  not  make  reference  to
    each and every requirement set out under Appendix FM  which  she  would
    have to do if she had applied FM.   I do find it is open to her to make
    reference to the requirement for independent evidence in her judgment.

23. In essence the evidence put before the judge was not accepted as  being
    satisfactory and she based her determination on this.

24. I find there is no error of law and indeed no error  which  would  have
    made a material difference and therefore I find that the  determination
    should stand.
