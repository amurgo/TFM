                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Jegaraja instructed by Vasuki Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. It has previously been found appropriate, given  this  appeal  involves
    asylum issues, that the Appellant be granted anonymity unless and until
    the  Tribunal  directs  otherwise.   As  such,  no  report   of   these
    proceedings shall directly, or indirectly, identify  the  Appellant  or
    any members of his family.  Failure to comply with this direction could
    lead to a contempt of court.

 2. The Appellant, who was born in 23rd June 1978,  is  a  citizen  of  Sri
    Lanka.  He entered the United Kingdom on 16th January 2010  with  leave
    to enter as a Tier 4 (Student) Migrant valid until 10th June 2012.  Two
    subsequent applications to extend on the same basis were refused.   The
    Appellant did not leave and so became an overstayer.  On 10th June 2013
    the Appellant claimed asylum.  The Respondent refused  his  application
    on 19th July 2013.  The Respondent rejected his account  of  travelling
    to the UK to  escape  persecution  arising  from  his  having  provided
    assistance to the LTTE in the context of his employment. The Respondent
    relied, amongst other matters, on the  evidence  of  sustained  earlier
    attempts to travel here, including unsuccessful applications for  entry
    as a working holidaymaker and student applications made in 2004,  2005,
    May and June 2009, inconsistencies in employment in the  chronology  of
    his claim when compared to the earlier applications,  the  lateness  of
    the claim, and the irregularity of the Appellant's immigration  status.
    The Respondent additionally rejected the  account  of  the  authorities
    continuing to look for him in Sri Lanka post his arrival  here  on  the
    basis that their own intelligence would have revealed that he had  left
    the country through the airport on his own passport.

 3. The Appellant appealed the decision to the First-tier  Tribunal.  In  a
    determination promulgated on 20th September 2013 Judge  of  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Courtney  dismissed   the   Appellant's   international
    protection  Grounds  of  Appeal  and  those  relating  to  humanitarian
    protection and Article 8.

 4. The Appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal  on  the  basis  that  the
    judge had misunderstood the evidence:

      i) He receipts showing the onward transmission of  goods  through  the
         transport company for which he worked. The judge considered them in
         the context of whether they demonstrated transactions on behalf  of
         the LTTE, rather than the point to which they were submitted, which
         was that the Appellant was in fact  employed  as  asserted  at  ARM
         Transport (paragraph 36 of the determination refers). The judge was
         concerned that he did not have evidence that the signature  on  the
         receipts was that of the Appellant as claimed.

     ii) At paragraph 39  the  IJ  failed  to  adequately  engage  with  the
         documentary evidence of the Appellant's employment.  The  Appellant
         had provided  a  police  registration  certificate  confirming  his
         address and employment.  The FtTJ found  the  evidence  lacking  in
         weight in the absence of examples  of  genuine  certificates.   The
         grounds complain that that was an irrational decision.

    iii) In addition, in assessing the fact of employment the IJ  failed  to
         take account of the  fact  that  the  Appellant  had  provided  the
         correct address when asked to do so at AIR and had  submitted  five
         receipts dating from November 2007.

     iv) The finding at paragraph 46 that the Appellant's  account  revealed
         no apparent improbabilities in the context  of  detention  and  ill
         treatment and yet concluding that it had occurred in the  aftermath
         of a round-up was unsustainable because  it  was  contrary  to  the
         Appellant's own evidence that he had been the subject of a targeted
         arrest on 22nd October 2009 as a result of an informer  identifying
         him.  Further, the Appellant's account of the inhuman and degrading
         persecutory treatment that he had received showed a  profile  which
         went beyond simply  being  an  individual  who  had  the  sorts  of
         ordinary links to the LTTE  associated  with  someone  whose  links
         arise purely as a result of their residence in  an  LTTE-controlled
         area whom the jurisprudence  indicates  are  merely  "detained  and
         harassed".

 5. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun on  18th  December
    2013.

 6. So it was that the matter came before me to determine if the judge  had
    made an error and if so what to do about it. I heard  submissions  from
    the representatives.

 7. Ms Jegaraja although formally adopting the grounds as  drafted  did  to
    seek to address me on them, but instead explained that the force of the
    appeal  lay  in  her  submission  that  the  Ft  TJ  had  accepted  the
    Appellant's claim of detention and ill-treatment  as  being  consistent
    with the country guidance and credible, and in that context the  detail
    of the claim as accepted, belied the judge's  findings.  The  Appellant
    had given evidence of targeted detention during which  the  authorities
    had demonstrated significant interest in him. In combination  with  the
    witness statement evidence of continuing interest in  him  post-flight,
    in the context of GJ, he came within the category set out  at  356(7A),
    or alternatively, he came within the UNHCR guidelines of a category  of
    claimant who may well qualify  for  international  protection  and  who
    require extensive consideration of their individual circumstances.

 8. Mr Tarlow for the Respondent submitted that the expanded  grounds  were
    in effect a gloss, relying on a partial reading of  the  account.   The
    judge  had  made  sustainable  findings  in  respect  of  the  lack  of
    credibility of the Appellant's account and the  decision  was  robustly
    defended.

My Consideration and Findings

 9. I find that the grounds as drafted are not made out.

10. In respect to of the ground relying on the treatment  of  the  receipts
    Paragraph 36 of the determination states:

         "36. The Appellant claims that he sent food items to  the  LTTE  in
             Mannar twice a month [WS �10].  Once  he  sent  a  phone  (AIR
             Q41), once some iron bars (AIR Q51) and once  a  bicycle  (AIR
             Q157).  In oral evidence the Appellant said that the  receipts
             were in his handwriting, and that it was part of his job as  a
             billing clerk at  ARM  Transport  to  fill  in  receipts.   No
             example of [the Appellant's] handwriting has been supplied  as
             a comparator.  On the one hand the Appellant said that he  had
             kept the receipts for his records, but on the  other  he  said
             that he 'didn't keep this purposely but it was there inside my
             book' (AIR Q172).  As noted, the five  ARM  Transport  Service
             receipts are all dated 3 November 2007.  One of  the  receipts
             appears to relate to iron products and one to a  bicycle.   It
             is  hard  to  see  what  relation  they  might  have  to   the
             Appellant's claimed  LTTE  activities,  given  that  all  five
             consignments were sent on a single day.  In oral evidence  the
             Appellant said that his mother had scanned  the  receipts  and
             sent them to him via email in 2012, but that she had destroyed
             the originals out of fear when his father was  beaten  up  (in
             August 2013).   It  is  unclear  why  she  did  not  post  the
             originals to him at the same time that she sent the email.  It
             is also unclear why she would have sent him  the  receipts  in
             2012 in the first place, given that he claims  to  have  known
             nothing about making asylum claims until May  2013  and  would
             have had little use for them."

11. A full reading of the paragraph reveals the detailed consideration that
    the judge gave to the oral and documentary evidence.  The  ground  that
    having put the receipts in for one particular  evidential  purpose  the
    judge could not read across conclusion  based  upon  that  evidence  to
    other parts of his account is nonsensical.  It  is  trite  law  that  a
    claim is assessed in the round on the basis  of  all  of  the  evidence
    submitted.  As the judge notes, the Appellant  indicated  that  he  had
    sent goods through the transport business to the LTTE over a period and
    in particular that on one occasion he had  sent  an  iron  bar  and  on
    another occasion a bicycle.  The receipts provided  were  all  for  one
    date, a matter which  on  a  commonsense  basis  does  not  assist  the
    Appellant's account in terms of the time period but more importantly  ,
    being contrary to his account that a bicycle and an iron had been  sent
    on different days.  Further the judge  noted  the  number  of  receipts
    produced for a single day in the absence of a reasonable explanation as
    to their particular retention (AIR Q172) did not assist the  Appellant.
    The judge also made cogent observations as to the  difficulties  as  to
    the timing and  provenance  of  the  receipts,  as  well  as  to  their
    character and quality.

12. With regard to the claimed employment with  ARM  Transport   the  judge
    considered  the Police registration certificate, at  paragraph  37  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge stated:

         "37. A police registration certificate dated 9 November 2007  lists
             [the Appellant] as a staff member of  ARM  Transport  Service.
             The police registration certificate is a scanned document  and
             the original has not been supplied.  I  do  not  know  how  it
             compares to known examples of such  certificates.   I  am  not
             prepared to place weight on this document."

    It is trite law that the absence of  the  original  detracts  from  the
    weight of a document and further, in the absence of evidence as to  the
    context of such  a  registration  document,  their  expected  form  and
    content, there can be no surprise that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    placed no weight upon it.

13. The grounds also challenge paragraph 39 of the judge's decision:

         "39. The Appellant claims to have admitted to having sent items  to
             the LTTE in Mannar via buses; he says that he did not name ARM
             Transport Service because he did not want to get  anyone  into
             trouble.  In my judgment, if the Appellant  was  genuinely  an
             employee of that company - and was listed as such in a  police
             registration certificate - then it is not  credible  that  the
             authorities  would  not  have  thoroughly   investigated   his
             employment at ARM Transport  Service,  which  was  an  obvious
             supply channel."

14. At paragraph 53 the Judge concludes:

         "53. In light of my findings as to fact and credibility  I  do  not
             accept that  the  Appellant  was  employed  by  ARM  Transport
             Service in Colombo between 2007 and 2009, nor that he assisted
             the LTTE in the manner he claims.  I  am  prepared  to  accept
             that he was detained by  the  authorities  for  one  month  in
             October 2009, but consider that this was likely to  have  been
             in consequence of a routine round-up of Tamil men  in  Colombo
             and not the result  of  specific  information  provided  about
             him."

    Reading the decision as a whole, including, at paragraph 38, the  Judge
    finding it inconsistent that in his 2009 visa application the Appellant
    had not named ARM Transport as an employer, but had listed two  others,
    and also provided evidence from his employers of employment  with  them
    but had not done so in respect of  ARM  transport.  In  the  round  the
    finding that the Appellant had failed to meet the low standard of proof
    in establishing that he was employed as claimed and   provided  support
    to the LTTE in the context of that employments,   is  sustainable,  and
    properly and fully explained. The fact  that  the  Appellant  correctly
    provided the address of the company in his AIR interview cannot be said
    to be determinative of his employment so as to make the findings of the
    judge perverse.

15. At paragraph 54 the Ft TJ states:

         "54. [The Appellant] was released on  payment  of  a  bribe,  which
         accords with expert evidence indicating that bribery and corruption
         are endemic in Sri Lanka [see the country guidance case  of  GJ  at
         �424].  The release does not appear to  have  been  effected  in  a
         surreptitious manner, and formal reporting conditions were  put  in
         place.  Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act  there  is  provision
         for people to be arrested without charge or trial and detained  for
         up to 18 months while police investigate the possibility  of  their
         involvement in illegal activity [COIR  �10.05].   In  EG  v  United
         Kingdom (App no. 41178/08) the Court considered that the fact  that
         the applicant was  released  from  custody,  albeit  conditionally,
         indicated that the authorities did not  have  a  continuing  strong
         level of interest in him.  If he were considered  to  have  further
         information  to  divulge,  or  to  have  assisted  the  LTTE  in  a
         significant fashion, he would have  been  kept  in  custody.   [The
         Appellant] was not deemed to be of sufficient  adverse  concern  in
         November 2009 to require re-education through the  'rehabilitation'
         programme in an SLA-run camp before  being  reintroduced  into  Sri
         Lankan civil society.  In my judgment, the Sri  Lankan  authorities
         must have been confident  that  he  had  nothing  to  do  with  any
         significantly subversive activity and recognised that  he  was  not
         going to provide any useful information on the LTTE."

16. The judge's findings at paragraph  54  are  conclusions  which  he  was
    entitled to reach on the basis of the evidence and the findings of fact
    which he had made.

17. The Appellant also asserts an error  on  the  basis  of  a  failure  to
    determine a factual dispute. The Appellant had given witness  statement
    evidence that the authorities continue to remain interested in him post-
    flight, and the Respondent had set out in the refusal  letter  that  in
    the light of intelligence to the  point  that  he  was  in  the  United
    Kingdom, that position was implausible. I  am  satisfied  there  is  no
    error here because it is a dispute which, in the context of the  cogent
    adverse credibility findings of the targeted nature of  the  detention,
    plainly falls away as being determined against the  Appellant   and  is
    not a factual dispute which required specific reasoning by the judge.

18. Ms Jegararja's concentrated in her submission on the judge's finding at
    paragraph 48 that the  Appellant  had  established  that  he  had  been
    detained, and suffered torture and ill treatment. The judge noted:

      i) "There were no significant improbabilities in D's  account  of  his
         experience of torture  and  he  was  not  cross  examined  on  that
         account"

19. However those findings cannot be properly extrapolated,  as  submitted,
    to show that the appellant's account of the reasons for, and detail  of
    what he was asked during detention, and such like, was established.  To
    the contrary, and as I have referred to above, the  judge  has  plainly
    rejected his account  in  respect  of  those  matters  and   found  the
    Appellant's claim lacking in credibility.  The submission relies  on  a
    mischaracterisation of limited positive findings and is  predicated  on
    an acceptance of the Appellant's account by the judge which a  detailed
    reading of the decision reveals as unsustainable.  The  assertion  that
    there was no evidence that round ups were happening when the  Appellant
    claimed to have been detained takes the  case  no  further  because  it
    cannot be said that the judge made positive findings in respect of  the
    claimed date of detention.

20. This is a case where the judge  has  found  that  at  its  highest  the
    Appellant's case is consistent with exposure to the authorities and the
    receipt of ill-treatment in the context of the findings, inter alia, in
    TK (Tamils - LP updated) Sri  Lanka  CG  [2009]  UKAIT  heard  on  27th
    October 2009, and the conclusion that there is no real risk  that  that
    occurred in  the  circumstances  described  by  the  Appellant  is  not
    internally inconsistent nor perverse on the evidence.

21. In the context of risk outside of the categories set out in GJ this  is
    not a case where the assessment of risk is flawed as a result of a tick
    list consideration. Detailed consideration of the decision reveals that
    anxious scrutiny was given to the claim, with an  open  mind  to  risk,
    whether within the categories of GJ or otherwise.   There  has  been  a
    more than sufficient consideration of the claim.  The  judge  has  done
    sufficient to determine the claim, and has provided more than  adequate
    reasoning.

22. On the facts as found there is no sustainable challenge to the decision
    on the basis that this appellant falls  for  international  protection,
    whether within a category of GJ or outside of it  under  older  country
    guidance or the UNHCR guidelines.

Decision

23. The First-tier Tribunal Judge made no material error  of  law  and  the
    decision dismissing the Appellant's appeal on all grounds stands.
