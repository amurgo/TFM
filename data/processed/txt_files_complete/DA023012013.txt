                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. On 14th May 2014, following a hearing at Birmingham, it  was  found
        that a panel of the First-tier Tribunal had materially erred in law
        in allowing PE's appeal against the order for his deportation  from
        the United Kingdom for the reasons set out  in  the  error  of  law
        finding and directions document of  the  same  date.  There  are  a
        number of findings of the First-tier Tribunal which are  preserved.
        These include PE's Greek nationality, his date of  entry  into  the
        United Kingdom in the year 2000, the existence of two  children  of
        which he is the father, the existence of family life recognised  by
        Article 8 between PE  and  the  children  which  is  maintained  by
        ongoing contact, and the finding  that  there  is  no  family  life
        recognised by Article 8 between PE and  his  former  partner.  PE's
        offending history is also accepted and set out below.


     2. As stated, PE is a Greek  national.  Following  his  conviction  at
        Ipswich Crown Court he has been made the subject of  a  deportation
        order pursuant to section 32 (4) of the UK Borders Act 2007.  It is
        PE's case that he falls within one of the  exceptions  set  out  in
        section 33 of the 2007 Act, namely that his removal from the United
        Kingdom in pursuance of  the  deportation  order  will  breach  his
        rights under the European Community treaties .


     3. PE's offending history is as follows:

     4. The index offence arises from a serious assault. In his  sentencing
        remarks HHJ Coffey stated:


     Whatever the background that took place prior to the events  that  took
   place in the early hours of the 18th September of last year, the  picture
   that   emerges in this case is that the victim was the sole occupant of a
   room in    the lodging house in this town. In  the  early  hours  of  the
   morning he was      disturbed, assaulted  and  injured,  and  during  the
   course of the attack a  weapon described as a hockey stick was  used.  He
   sustained an unattractive    injury by the use of that weapon, and it  is
   fortunate that the injuries  which      he  did  sustain  were  not  more
   serious than they were.


     In the course of the time that you  three  had  entered  that  house  a
   quantity   of cash was stolen from him by you, the second defendant,  [Mr
   S].


     The culpability of the first and third defendants - that  is  [PE]  and
   you [SF] -     in my view was  significant  given  the  circumstances  in
   which this assault  occurred: in the middle of the night, and in the home
   of the victim.


     Both you [PE] and you [SF] have significant criminal records....


     Had you not pleaded guilty, [PE] in the way you have this morning,  the
   sentences imposed upon you and the others would have been  greater:  [PE]
   for you, the sentence would have been one of 27  months;  and  you  [SF],
   would have received a sentence of 21 months imprisonment.


     In the event, the sentences that I impose on Count 2, so far as you are
     concerned [PE] is one of two years' imprisonment.


     5. As with any case involving an EEA national who is the subject of  a
        deportation order it is necessary to consider the  status  of  that
        individual  within  the  United  Kingdom  under  Community  law  to
        ascertain the level of protection available to them.


     6. By virtue of Regulation 19(3) of the Immigration (European Economic
        Area) Regulations 2006 (as amended),  hereinafter  referred  to  as
        'the Regulations' a person who has been admitted to, or acquired  a
        right to reside in, the United Kingdom under these Regulations  may
        be removed from the United Kingdom if:
          (a)      he does not have or ceases to  have  a  right  to  reside
      under these               Regulations; or
          (b)     he would otherwise be entitled to  reside  in  the  United
   Kingdom under           these Regulations but the Secretary of State  has
   decided that his removal is           justified on the grounds of  public
   policy, public security or public  health            in  accordance  with
   regulation 21.


     7. For the Appellant to have acquired a permanent right  of  residence
        he must satisfy Regulation 15 which states:


          Regulation15.


          (1)      The following persons shall acquire the right  to  reside
      in the United             Kingdom permanently-
              (a)  an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom  in
                   accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period
      of five               years;
              (b)  a family member of an EEA national who is not himself  an
      EEA                   national but  who  has  resided  in  the  United
      Kingdom with  the  EEA           national  in  accordance  with  these
      Regulations for a continuous                period of five years;
              (c)  a worker or self-employed person who has ceased activity;
              (d)  the family member of a worker or self-employed person who
      has              ceased activity;
              (e)  a person who was the family member of a worker  or  self-
      employed              person where-
                   (i)      the worker or self-employed person has died;
                   (ii)     the family member resided with  him  immediately
      before his                death; and
                   (iii)    the worker or self-employed person  had  resided
      continuously                  in the United Kingdom for at  least  the
      two years immediately                  before his death or  the  death
      was  the  result  of  an  accident  at                  work   or   an
      occupational disease;
              (f)  a person who-
                   (i)      has resided in the United Kingdom in  accordance
      with these                Regulations for a continuous period of  five
      years; and
                   (ii)     was, at the end of that period, a family  member
      who has                       retained the right of residence.
          (2)      Once acquired, the right  of  permanent  residence  under
      this regulation       shall be lost  only  through  absence  from  the
      United Kingdom for a period        exceeding two consecutive years.
          (3)      But this regulation is subject to regulation 19(3)(b).


     8. In relation to  self  employment:  in  R  (on  the  application  of
        Tilianu) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2010] EWCA Civ
        1397 the Romanian Claimant was refused jobseekers  allowance.   The
        Court of Appeal held that "self employment" did not come within the
        meaning of "employment" in Article 7(3)(b) and (c) of the  Citizens
        Directive and accordingly the Claimant, as a  self-employed  worker
        who had ceased to be  in  work,  could  not  retain  his  right  of
        residence under the Citizens Directive  and  was  not  eligible  to
        claim JSA (paras 20 - 22).


     9. The Appellant entered the United Kingdom in 2000 for  the  purposes
        of seeking treatment for drug related problems. As such he did  not
        enter for the purposes of being a worker and has  not  demonstrated
        he was able to satisfy the criteria as a  self  sufficient  person.
        No claim is  made  on  this  basis  and  no  evidence  of  adequate
        resources or comprehensive medical insurance being held by him  has
        been provided.


    10. The Appellant, however, claims he is a worker and  has  acquired  a
        right to reside permanently in the United Kingdom  on  this  basis.
        Whether the Appellant has established  that  he  can  satisfy  this
        criterion has  to  be  assessed  against  established  criteria  as
        illustrated in Begum (EEA - worker  -  jobseeker)  Pakistan  [2011]
        UKUT 00275 (IAC) and Ali v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 484.


    11. In Begum the Tribunal  held  that  when  deciding  whether  an  EEA
        national is a worker for  the  purposes  of  the  EEA  Regulations,
        regard must be had to the fact that the term has a  meaning  in  EU
        law, that it must  be  interpreted  broadly  and  that  it  is  not
        conditioned by the type of  employment  or  the  amount  of  income
        derived.  But a person who does not pursue  effective  and  genuine
        activities, or pursues activities on such a small scale  as  to  be
        regarded as purely marginal and ancillary or which have no economic
        value to an employer, is not a worker.   In  this  context,  regard
        must be given to the nature of the employment relationship and  the
        rights and duties  of  the  person  concerned  to  decide  if  work
        activities are effective and genuine.


    12. In Ali the Court of Appeal said  that  a  person  need  not  be  in
        employment at the relevant time to qualify as  a  worker  under  EC
        law, but there had to be  evidence  that  he  or  she  was  seeking
        employment and had a genuine chance of being employed.


    13. There is evidence of  some  employment   being  undertaken  by  the
        Appellant and benefits being claimed as follows:

                                             employment     of     Appellant
                                as a driver.


    14. The evidence of periods of work appears to total  months  only  and
        there is evidence of benefits being claimed until mid 2012  in  the
        bundle too. The Appellant was imprisoned in 2013 and only commenced
        his current job on release in January 2014.   In  relation  to  the
        benefit payments these have been made by  the  Jobcentreplus.  Most
        are described  as  being  Employment  Support  Allowance  which  is
        ordinarily paid if a person is ill or  disabled  and  which  offers
        financial support if a claimant is unable to work and  personalised
        help so they can work if they are able to. The issue in  this  case
        is that insufficient evidence has  been  provided  to  explain  the
        nature of the illness and why this disqualified the Appellant  from
        having to seek employment or, if relevant, what efforts he  was  in
        fact making to secure employment, which is at a time he was  taking
        drugs and committing related offences.


    15. Regulation 6 defines a "Qualified person" as:

         (1)  In these Regulations, "qualified person" means a person who
is an EEA national              and in the United Kingdom as-

              (a)      a jobseeker;
              (b)      a worker;
              (c)      a self-employed person;
              (d)      a self-sufficient person; or
              (e)      a student.

         (2)  Subject to regulation 7A(4), a person who is no longer
working shall not cease to              be treated as a worker for the
purpose of paragraph (1)(b) if-

              (a)      he is temporarily unable to work as the result of an
illness or accident;
              (b)      he is in duly recorded involuntary unemployment
after having been                       employed in the United Kingdom,
provided that he has registered as a                  jobseeker with the
relevant employment office and-

                  (i)  he was employed for one year or more before becoming
unemployed;
                  (ii)     he has been unemployed for no more than six
months; or
                  (iii)    he can provide evidence that he is seeking
employment in the United                     Kingdom and has a genuine
chance of being engaged;
              (c)      he is involuntarily unemployed and has embarked on
vocational training;                or
              (d)      he has voluntarily ceased working and embarked on
vocational training                 that is related to his previous
employment.

         (3)  A person who is no longer in self-employment shall not cease
to be treated as a              self-employed person for the purpose of
paragraph (1)(c) if he is temporarily            unable to pursue his
activity as a self-employed person as the result of an illness
or accident.

         (4)  For the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), "jobseeker" means a
person who enters the           United Kingdom in order to seek employment
and can provide evidence that he             is seeking employment and has
a genuine chance of being engaged.


    16. The relevant qualifying period does not have to be  continuous  but
        the evidence of actual employment is  well  below  the  five  years
        requirement indicating the Appellant is  dependant  upon  it  being
        accepted he can qualify as a jobseeker for  the  remaining  period.
        An issue for the Appellant in this regard is the fact  he  did  not
        enter the United Kingdom to seek employment but for rehabilitation.
        In Begum (EEA - worker -  jobseeker)  Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  00275
        (IAC) the Tribunal  held  that  when  considering  whether  an  EEA
        national is a jobseeker for the purposes of EU law, regard must  be
        had to whether the  person  entered  the  United  Kingdom  to  seek
        employment and, if so, whether that  person  can  provide  evidence
        that they have a genuine chance of being engaged.  If a person does
        not or cannot provide relevant evidence, then an appeal is bound to
        fail on this ground.


    17. In AG and others (EEA - jobseeker - self-sufficient person - proof)
        Germany [2007] UKAIT 00075 the Tribunal held that '(i)  To  qualify
        as a "jobseeker" under reg 6(1)(a)  of  the  Immigration  (European
        Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003) an EEA national must
        meet all three requirements set out at reg 6(4), including that  he
        be a person who  entered  the  United  Kingdom  in  order  to  seek
        employment. (ii) A person who is a jobseeker can also qualify as  a
        "worker" under reg 6(1)(b) but the requirements applied by ECJ case
        law in respect of workers-as-jobseekers are essentially the same as
        those set out in reg 6(1)(a). (iii) In considering what  period  of
        time a jobseeker has to find work, 6 months may be a  general  rule
        of thumb, but there is no fixed time limit. The ECJ  in  Antonissen
        [1991] ECR I-745, Case C-344/95 decided that the period must  be  a
        "reasonable period" and the assessment of what is "reasonable" must
        be made in the  context  of  each  individual  case.  Thus  it  may
        sometimes be less, sometimes more, than 6  months.  In  all  cases,
        however, the period in question must start from  the  date  of  the
        person's arrival in the United Kingdom. (iv) To satisfy  the  self-
        sufficiency requirement of the EEA Regulations, under reg 4(4)  the
        resources of a family member cannot be aggregated with those of the
        EEA national where those resources are derived from past employment
        of that family member: W(China) and X(China) [2006] EWCA Civ  1494,
        GM and AM [2006] UKAIT 00059 and MA and others [2006]  UKAIT  00090
        applied. (v) The burden of proof is on the  applicant/appellant  to
        establish any EEA right of admission or  residence.  A  failure  to
        substantiate any such right - for example  by  failing  to  produce
        relevant evidence - is likely to mean that  the  claim/appeal  will
        fail.


    18. Without prejudice to the primary position that as the Appellant did
        not enter the UK for work he is unable to  satisfy  the  conditions
        set out in the Regulations in this regard, the period of dependency
        upon benefits is in the region of seven years. There is mention  of
        a medical certificate in the papers but no detailed explanation  of
        the reasons for such a long period of claim or  what  efforts  were
        being made to find work at this time, or to show the Appellant  was
        genuinely seeking and available for work. It was during this period
        he  was  using  drugs  and  there  is  little  evidence  of  proper
        integration or compliance with the principle of the  Free  Movement
        Directive which relate to the right of an EU national to seek  work
        in another Member  State.     In  RP  (Italy)  [2006]  UKAIT  00025
        (Storey) the Tribunal held that a person  who  has  been  a  worker
        within the meaning of Community law does not cease to be  a  worker
        simply by virtue of falling unemployed, but he must be able to show
        that he has been genuinely seeking work  and  has  not  effectively
        abandoned the labour market.  In assessing  whether  a  person  has
        satisfied the condition that he is or has remained  a  worker,  the
        national court must base its examination on objective criteria  and
        assess as a whole all the circumstances of the case relating to the
        nature of both that person's activities whilst in the member  state
        and any employment relationships at issue.


    19. I accept that for the purposes of reg 6(2)(a)  of  the  Immigration
        (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, a person whose inability
        to work as a result of illness or  accident  is  not  permanent  is
        temporarily unable to work,  but  that  must  be  substantiated  by
        relevant evidence.


    20. The above required test has not been adequately  addressed  by  the
        Appellant who has therefore not established he is able  to  satisfy
        the requirements of Regulation 6  or  that  during  the  period  he
        claims to have been a jobseeker that he provided evidence  that  he
        was seeking employment and had a genuine chance of being engaged. I
        find the Appellant has not substantiated his  claim  to  have  been
        exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom  for  the  requisite
        period of five years such  as  to  acquire  a  right  of  permanent
        residence.


    21. The Appellant claims also that he has acquired a right  to  benefit
        from the highest level of protection as he has been in  the  United
        Kingdom for more than ten years.


    22. The expulsion decision, the deportation order, is dated 8th October
        2013, and ten years prior to this is therefore 8th October 2003. It
        is accepted the Appellant has been in the United Kingdom since 2000
        which is more than ten years but he has been imprisoned for some of
        that time.

    23. In the recent decision in SSHD v  MG  Case  no  c-400/12  CJEU  the
        second chamber held that unlike the requisite period for  acquiring
        a  right  of  permanent  residence  which  began  when  the  person
        concerned commenced lawful residence in the host Member State,  the
        10 year period of residence necessary for the grant of the enhanced
        protection provided for in Article 28(3)(a) must be  calculated  by
        counting back from the date of the decision ordering that  person's
        expulsion. All relevant factors should be taken into  account  when
        considering the calculation of the 10  year  period  including  the
        duration of each period of absence from the host Member State,  the
        cumulative duration and the frequency  of  absences.  A  period  of
        imprisonment was in principle  capable  both  of  interrupting  the
        continuity of the period of residence needed and of  affecting  the
        decision regarding the grant of enhanced protection provided  there
        under, even where the person concerned  had  resided  in  the  host
        member state for 10 years prior to  imprisonment  albeit  that  the
        fact that the person had been in the member state 10 years prior to
        imprisonment was a factor to be taken into account.


    24. It is said the above decision contains a tension in relation to the
        meaning of "enhanced protection" which has been  clarified  by  the
        Upper  Tribunal  in  MG  (prison-Article  28  (3)(a)  of   Citizens
        Directive) Portugal [2014] UKUT 00392 to mean  that   a  period  of
        imprisonment during those 10 years does not necessarily  prevent  a
        person from qualifying for enhanced protection if  that  person  is
        sufficiently integrated. However, according to the same judgment, a
        period of imprisonment must have a negative impact  in  so  far  as
        establishing integration is concerned.


    25. In this case the Appellant has not demonstrated that he has a right
        of permanent residence as all he has established is that he entered
        the United Kingdom for rehabilitation purposes and  not  for  work,
        has only worked for a limited period of time, and thereafter relied
        upon state benefits for the majority of this time in the UK without
        providing adequate evidence to prove he satisfied the definition of
        a jobseeker or as a person temporarily unable to work.


    26. DIRECTIVE 2004/38/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE  COUNCIL
        of 29 April 2004, the Free  Movement  Directive,  was  incorporated
        into UK domestic law by the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
        Regulations 2006 (as  amended).  Of  relevance  to  this  issue  is
        Article 28 (3) which provides that an expulsion decision may not be
        taken against Union citizens, except if the decision  is  based  on
        imperative grounds of public security, as defined by Member States,
        if they:

         (a)  have resided in the host Member State  for  the  previous  ten
years; or
         (b)  are a minor, except if the  expulsion  is  necessary  for  the
best interests of  the            child,  as  provided  for  in  the  United
Nations Convention on the Rights of              the Child  of  20  November
1989.

    27. Regulation 21(4) of the 2006 Regulations states:




          (4)     A relevant decision may not be taken except on  imperative
   grounds of              public security in respect of an EEA national who-




              (a)      has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous
   period  of  at  least                ten  years  prior  to  the  relevant
   decision; or
              (b)      is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
   is necessary in his                   best interests, as provided for  in
   the Convention on the Rights of the                Child adopted  by  the
   General Assembly of the United Nations on                   20th November
   1989.


    28. The debate in relation to these issues is not to the actual wording
        but what they mean in practice and how they should be applied.   In
        Secretary of State for the Home Department v FV (Italy) [2012] EWCA
        Civ 1199 the Court considered that Article 28(3)(a) was essentially
        an integration test. In  Regulation  24  there  is  a  need  for  a
        continuous period of at least  10  years  residence  prior  to  the
        relevant decision whereas in MG the  CJEU  appears  to  contemplate
        that  someone  with  'non-continuous'  residence  can  qualify  for
        enhanced protection under  Rules,  raising  the  issue  of  whether
        Regulation 24 is inconsistent with European  law  in  this  regard.
        Onuekwere (Judgment of the Court) [2014] EUECJ C-378/12 (16 January
        2014) also considered.


    29. If the correct test is that of integration the Appellant  fails  as
        on the facts the evidence of integration is not  that  great  after
        such a period of time. There  is  little  evidence  of  integration
        within the UK job market. The right of permanent residence is a key
        element in promoting social cohesion and was provided for  by  that
        directive in order to strengthen the feeling of Union  citizenship.
        The EU legislature accordingly made the acquisition of the right of
        permanent residence pursuant to Article 16(1) of Directive  2004/38
        subject to the integration of the citizen of the Union in the  host
        Member  State  (see  Case  C-162/09  Lassal  [2010]   ECR   I-9217,
        paragraphs 32 and 37). Such integration has not been proved.  It is
        based not only on territorial and  temporal  factors  but  also  on
        qualitative elements, relating to the level of integration  in  the
        host Member State.


    30. If the test is 'time served' only in the host state  the  Appellant
        may succeed in his claim to be entitled to the  enhanced  level  of
        protection.  In  this  regard,  if  Article  28  is   the   correct
        interpretation: 'to have resided in the host Member State  for  the
        previous ten years' the Appellant must be found to  have  satisfied
        the same as it is accepted he has lived in the UK  since  2000  and
        the decision for his removal  is dated  8th October 2013.   If  the
        wording of Regulation 24 is the relevant one there is  a  need  for
        ten years continuous  residence  to  have  occurred  prior  to  the
        expulsion decision, even though the quality of his  integration  is
        poor.


    31. The Appellant has established that he has resided in the UK  for  a
        continuous period of ten years.  He was imprisoned  in  2013  which
        broke the continuity of the period of  residence,  and  so  whether
        entitled to the enhanced level of protection will  depend  upon  an
        assessment of all relevant facts. In relation  to  the  integration
        issue, the Appellant admits to drug use but claims  this  ended  on
        6th October 2008.  He claims to have been in  a  relationship  with
        his ex-partner since March 2001 which he states  lasted  for  eight
        years. Their first child was born in July 2002 and a  second  child
        in May 2008. The claim that it was  during  this  relationship  the
        Appellant became a drug user is contradicted by the fact he came to
        the UK for rehabilitation from his drug usage in  Greece.  What  is
        clear from his evidence,  however,  is  that  his  return  to  drug
        addiction  had  a  material  effect  upon   his   lifestyle.   This
        relationship ended and it is a preserved finding that there  is  no
        family life with his ex-partner.


    32. The two children are British citizens and live with their mother.


    33. In 2009 the  Appellant  formed  a  relationship  with  his  current
        partner. They  co-habitted  from  October  2010.  It  is  said  the
        relationship will  breakdown  if  he  is  deported.  The  Appellant
        accepts in paragraph 12  of  his  witness  statement  that  he  has
        received various sentences to attempt  to  rehabilitate  him  which
        appear to have failed. He claims the custodial sentence has now had
        this effect as he claims he  cannot  be  without  his  partner  and
        children. The Appellant claims to have complied  with  all  licence
        conditions and to have worked with his probation officer.


    34. Against this assertion is  the  fact  the  offence  for  which  the
        Appellant was sentenced represents an escalation in his  offending.
        His continual acts of  criminality  indicate  he  has  never  truly
        integrated into British society as such integration  requires  more
        than setting up a home and fathering children in a Member State. It
        involves integration into the society of that State  which  can  be
        demonstrated by matters  such  as  work,  the  establishment  of  a
        settled and secure home base, and respecting and honouring the laws
        of that State. Living on the edge of a society, taking from  it  by
        way of benefits and not showing a proper contribution  being  made,
        without just cause, militates against the  same.  The  co-existence
        with a common bond of living as the expected norm within UK society
        has not been demonstrated by the Appellant in this case, even after
        over ten years residence.


    35. Having considered all the elements of this case with the degree  of
        care required  in  an  appeal  of  this  nature,  that  of  anxious
        scrutiny, I find the Appellant has failed to establish that  he  is
        entitled to the higher degree of  protection,  that  of  imperative
        grounds of public security.



Discussion



    36. As he has not established his entitlement to the  higher  level  of
        protection or to have established a right of permanent residence in
        the UK on the facts, the Appellant is only entitled  to  the  lower
        level of protection;  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
        security or public health of which the latter is not applicable  on
        the facts.


    37. Regulation 21(5) states that, where a relevant decision is taken on
        grounds of public policy or public security it shall,  in  addition
        to complying with the preceding paragraphs of this  regulation,  be
        taken in accordance with the following principles-
     (a)  the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality;
     (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct  of
          the person concerned;
     (c)  the personal conduct of the  person  concerned  must  represent  a
          genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of
   the            fundamental interests of society;
     (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which  relate
   to             considerations of general prevention do  not  justify  the
   decision;
     (e)  a person's previous criminal  convictions  do  not  in  themselves
   justify             the decision.


    38. Regulation 21(6) states that before taking a relevant  decision  on
        the grounds of public policy or public security in  relation  to  a
        person who is resident in the United  Kingdom  the  decision  maker
        must take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,  state  of
        health, family and economic situation of the person,  the  person's
        length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's social  and
        cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of  the
        person's links with his country of origin.


    39. The Appellant was born on the 9th March 1974, is  in  good  health,
        has a family and children in the  UK,  as  noted  above,  has  been
        reliant of benefits but now claims to be in employment, has resided
        in the UK since 2000 when he entered aged  26,  and  not  establish
        that he has no remaining links with Greece. The decision to  deport
        has been taken solely as a result of the commission  of  a  serious
        offence of violence by the Appellant and it has been established it
        is a decision based exclusively on his personal conduct.


    40. In relation to whether the personal  conduct  of  PE  represents  a
        genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
        the  fundamental  interests  of  society;  In  GW  (EEA   reg   21:
        'fundamental  interests')  Netherlands  [2009]  UKAIT   00050   the
        Tribunal said that the 'fundamental interests' of a society  within
        the meaning of reg 21 (a threat to which may justify the  exclusion
        of an EEA national) is a question to be determined by reference  to
        the legal rules governing  the  society  in  question,  for  it  is
        unlikely that conduct that is subject  to  no  prohibition  can  be
        regarded as threatening those interests.


    41. In this appeal the issue is one of re-offending. Although PE claims
        he presents no risk of re-offending this was not the  view  of  the
        National Probation Service when preparing a report at  the  request
        of the Respondent. That report is dated 10th  September  2013.  The
        First-tier Tribunal noted that the account of the index offence was
        not as PE had claimed before them and  the  author  of  the  report
        records that it was in fact PE who initially approached the  victim
        in his room asking him where the location of a named individual was
        and then beating him with a 'wooden stick' on his head, shins, left
        hip, and on the arm.  The victim then  stated  that  the  attackers
        took his car keys and escorted him to a car  with  PE  driving  the
        vehicle.  The police were eventually called and discovered what was
        described as a hockey stick and that PE was  arrested  driving  the
        victim's car.  PE was initially charged with Robbery,  Kidnap,  and
        Theft of a Motor Vehicle. Although he was convicted  and  sentenced
        for AOABH and the Kidnap and Theft charges dismissed,  the  Robbery
        charge has been left to lie on the file.


    42. Having examined other relevant matters in section 5 of  the  report
        PE is assessed as presenting a medium risk of harm  to  the  public
        and a medium likelihood of reconviction.  It is  noted  within  the
        body of the report  that  the  previous  offending  and  drugs  and
        employability issues are not linked to offending  behaviour  as  PE
        informed the officer he was a signed off as  being  unfit  to  work
        although not working which decreased his access to income.


    43. PE is noted to have become addicted  to  heroin  whilst  living  in
        Greece and was sent to a rehabilitation centre in England  in  2000
        where he remained for six months and then remained  'clean'  for  a
        further 12 months after leaving. He then began to use Crack Cocaine
        which he misused on a long-term basis leading  to  an  overdose  in
        2008 and hospitalisation.  It is noted that the drug use  prior  to
        the index offence and previous convictions of possession and  theft
        to fund his drug use means a link to both offending  behaviour  and
        risk of serious harm.  It also noted that  from  what  PE  told  an
        interviewing officer, he does have the opportunity to live a  'pro-
        social lifestyle with this partner and to  care  for  his  children
        although the  continued  association  with  his  co-defendants  and
        possible involvement  with  associates  involved  in  any  criminal
        activity may lead him to return to drug misuse and being implicated
        in the problems and settling of grudges in their lives.


    44. In relation to thinking behaviour the author of the report records;


     The OASys indicated that PE describes some issues with  temper  control
   as     he said that during the current offence he  'just  snapped'  which
   resulted in    him hitting the victim. He even admitted that  during  the
   course of the  offence he hit the victim on the leg he used to accelerate
   and therefore  would be unable to escape by driving.


     PE has reportedly shown a poor ability to recognise  some  problems  in
   that   he wants to distance himself from negative associations,  and  yet
   fully  intends to remain in contact with his co-defendant Mr S  and  even
   put    forward his address for HDC purposes.


     PE stated that he believed that his index offence was impulsive and  he
   regretted committing it, however more  because  of  the  consequences  to
   himself and his family rather than the victim's concerns. It was assessed
     however that the offence itself was premeditated especially  seeing  as
   he     and his co-defendants had all agreed to go together and had driven
   from   Birmingham to Ipswich giving them a significant amount of time  to
   rethink    their impending actions.


    45. Not only has PE, in the opinion of the author of the report, failed
        to disassociated himself with those of a negative influence,  which
        could lead to further convictions and repeat factors such as  those
        that led to  the  index  and  other  offending,  there  appears  no
        evidence of any consideration of the consequences  of  his  actions
        and no work that he has undertaken to understand what lead to  such
        action or how to prevent a recurrence in the future. The  available
        evidence indicates that PE has a real propensity to reoffend.   The
        nature of such offending  shows  that  PE  accordingly  presents  a
        genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the public.


    46. It cannot be in accordance with the doctrine of  public  policy  to
        permit an individual to remain who presents such a risk.  In Bulale
        (HB) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 806  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that
        protecting members of society from  violent  crime  was  clearly  a
        fundamental  interest  of  society  which  the  appellant  by   his
        propensity to commit robbery threatened.  The Tribunal was entitled
        to conclude that he represented a genuine and sufficiently  serious
        risk to the public  to  deport  him.   Whilst  the  thrust  of  the
        Directive was that it should be difficult to expel EU citizens  for
        crimes of dishonesty, violence was a different matter.   The  level
        of violence was not laid  down  and  member  States  were  given  a
        certain amount of judgement in deciding what their nationals had to
        put up with.


    47. In addition to the above matters any decision to deport  must  also
        comply with the principles of proportionality.  PE's  circumstances
        are set out above and proportionality in this respect is  not  that
        relating to family or private life under  Article  8  ECHR  but  in
        relation to the principles of free movement. In this respect PE has
        a partner in the United Kingdom who he lives with and two  children
        who he has contact with.  His  evidence  of  integration  into  the
        United Kingdom is very poor although he now claims to  be  free  of
        drugs, not to be offending, and to  have  secured  employment.  One
        element of the proportionality assessment requires  an  examination
        of the prospects of rehabilitation/reintegration.   In  Essa  (EEA:
        rehabilitation/integration) [2013] UKUT 00316  (IAC)  the  Tribunal
        said that what  is  likely  to  be  valuable  to  a  judge  in  the
        immigration jurisdiction who is considering  risk  factors  is  the
        extent of any progress made by a person  during  the  sentence  and
        licence period, and any material shift in OASys assessment of  that
        person.


    48. In this case PE, a Greek national, came to the  United  Kingdom  in
        2000 to seek rehabilitation from his drug addiction which proved to
        be unsuccessful. In R (on the application of Essa) [2012] EWCA  Civ
        1718 It was held that a decision to deport a union  citizen  had  a
        European dimension  which  widened  the  consideration  beyond  the
        interests of the expelling Member State and the  foreign  criminal.
        The decision maker had to consider whether the deportation decision
        could prejudice the prospects of rehabilitation from  offending  in
        the host country and then weigh  that  risk  in  the  balance  when
        assessing proportionality. In most cases it entailed  a  comparison
        with the prospects of rehabilitation in the receiving country.  The
        European dimension was part  of  the  proportionality  exercise  in
        respect    of     an     EU     deportee.     In     Essa     (EEA:
        rehabilitation/integration) [2013] UKUT 00316  (IAC)  it  was  held
        that for those who at the time of determination  are  or  remain  a
        present threat to public policy but where the factors  relevant  to
        integration  suggest  that  there  are  reasonable   prospects   of
        rehabilitation, those  prospects  can  be  a  substantial  relevant
        factor in the proportionality balance as to whether deportation  is
        justified. If the claimant cannot constitute a present threat  when
        rehabilitated, and is well-advanced in  rehabilitation  in  a  host
        state where there is a substantial degree of  integration,  it  may
        well very well be disproportionate to proceed  to  deportation.  At
        the other end of the scale, if there are no reasonable prospects of
        rehabilitation, the claimant is a present threat and is  likely  to
        remain so for the indefinite future, it  cannot  be  seen  how  the
        prospects of rehabilitation could constitute a  significant  factor
        in the balance. Thus, recidivist offenders, career criminals, adult
        offenders who have failed  to  engage  with  treatment  programmes,
        claimants with propensity to commit sexual or violent offences  and
        the like may well fall into this category.


    49. In this appeal the author of the report referred to  above  records
        the  fact  PE  continued  to  associate  with  his  co-accused  and
        potentially others of bad influence  and  has  a  long  history  of
        criminal offending for drug related  reasons.  The  report  clearly
        illustrates the serious nature of the  index  offence,  and  failed
        attempts in the past to avoid  drug  addiction  which  necessitated
        PE's entry to the United Kingdom in  the  opinion  of  others,  his
        relapsed 12 months thereafter, and further offending.   PE  claimed
        to be drug-free  from  2008  yet  the  offence  for  which  he  was
        convicted occurred on 18 September 2012 indicating a propensity  to
        reoffend that cannot be associated with drug addiction.


    50. PE has been under the care of the probation services in the  United
        Kingdom and at pages 11-12 of the Upper Tribunal appeal bundle is a
        letter from the National Offender  Management  Service  dated  29th
        January 2014 confirming compliance with licence  condition  pending
        release, no reports of substance misuse, an assertion by PE that he
        has managed to avoid contact with old associates, and obtained paid
        employment. The letter itself appears to be a two-page document but
        for reasons that are not known to this Tribunal only one  page  was
        disclosed and little  weight  can  be  placed  upon  an  incomplete
        document.


    51. PE also failed to obtain information regarding services that  would
        be available to him in Greece and has not been shown that  they  do
        not have  a  sufficiently  robust  probation  or  support  services
        available in that country if the same was required by him.   If  PE
        remains drug free his chances of  associating  with  those  who  he
        refers to in the United Kingdom is zero, unless they moved  Greece,
        indicating that there may be a better chance of rehabilitation  and
        a lesser risk of reoffending in Greece rather than if PE remains in
        the United Kingdom.


    52. Although PE has now obtained employment this  is  only  during  the
        course of this year and does not  represent  a  stable  pattern  of
        employment, although it may indicate an argument in his favour  for
        suggesting removal is disproportionate as will the presence of  his
        partner.


    53. I do not find it has been established  on  the  evidence  that  the
        removal of PE from the United Kingdom pursuant to  the  deportation
        order will result in a breach of any of the  Secretary  of  State's
        obligations under Community Law.


    54. In relation to the Article 8 ECHR claim: In VB (deportation of  EEA
        national: human rights?) Lithuania [2008] UKAIT 00087 the  Tribunal
        said that (i)  the respondent's power to deport an EEA national  is
        governed by the EEA Regulations 2006 and is  much  more  restricted
        than in an  'ordinary'  conducive  case.  Only  if  satisfied  that
        deportation is required on  grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
        security should the Tribunal go on to consider whether  deportation
        would contravene the Human Rights Convention.


    55. The Immigration Rules contain provisions relating to Article 8 ECHR
        and deportation. Those in force at the date of the  making  of  the
        deportation decision are:



         Deportation and Article 8



         398.  Where  a  person  claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
contrary to the UK's            obligations under Article  8  of  the  Human
Rights Convention, and

              (a)       the  deportation  of  the  person  from  the  UK  is
conducive  to  the  public  good                  because  they  have   been
convicted    of    an    offence    for     which     they     have     been
sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;
              (b)       the  deportation  of  the  person  from  the  UK  is
conducive  to  the  public  good                  because  they  have   been
convicted    of    an    offence    for     which     they     have     been
sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12
                  months; or
              (c)       the  deportation  of  the  person  from  the  UK  is
conducive to the public good                 because, in  the  view  of  the
Secretary of State, their offending has caused                 serious  harm
or   they   are   a   persistent   offender   who   shows    a    particular
disregard for the law,

              the Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider
whether paragraph 399           or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  it
will only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances              that  the  public
interest in deportation will be outweighed by other factors.

         399.     This paragraph applies where  paragraph  398  (b)  or  (c)
applies if -

              (a)      the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
relationship with a child               under the age of 18 years who is  in
the UK, and

                  (i)  the child is a British Citizen; or
                  (ii)     the child has lived in the  UK  continuously  for
at least the 7 years                    immediately preceding  the  date  of
the immigration decision; and in                      either case
                       (a)      it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  the
child to leave the UK;                           and
                       (b)      there is no other family member who is  able
to care for the child                        in the UK; or


              (b)      the person has a genuine and subsisting  relationship
with a partner who is               in the UK  and  is  a  British  Citizen,
settled in the UK, or in  the  UK  with                   refugee  leave  or
humanitarian protection, and

                  (i)  the person has lived  in  the  UK  with  valid  leave
continuously for  at                      least  the  15  years  immediately
preceding  the  date   of   the   immigration                       decision
(discounting any period of imprisonment); and
                  (ii)     there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
life with that partner                       continuing outside the UK.


         399A.    This paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
applies if -

                  (a)  the person has lived continuously in the  UK  for  at
least 20 years                      immediately preceding the  date  of  the
immigration  decision                          (discounting  any  period  of
imprisonment)  and  he  has  no   ties                            (including
social,   cultural   or   family)   with   the   country   to    which    he
would have to go if required to leave the UK; or
                  (b)  the person is aged under 25 years, he  has  spent  at
least half of his life                       living continuously in  the  UK
immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the                       immigration
decision    (discounting     any     period     of     imprisonment)     and
he has no ties (including social, cultural or family) with  the  country  to
                  which he would have to go if required to leave the UK.



    56. The sentence PE received  falls  within  paragraph  398(b)  and  so
        paragraph 399 applies.  PE has  not  demonstrated  he  is  able  to
        succeed under this provision for even though he has two children in
        the UK who are stated to be British citizens they live  with  their
        mother - 399 (a) (ii) (b). In relation to the  partner  route,  his
        current partner is a Latvian national who entered the  UK  in  2009
        and no insurmountable obstacles have been established to  show  why
        the family life they have cannot be  continued  in  Greece  on  the
        evidence.


    57. PE cannot succeed under 399A as he has not lived in the UK  for  20
        years and has not shown he has no ties to Greece. He is over 25.


    58. The Rules relating to deportation are a complete code, but even  if
        it was necessary to consider Article 8 as a freestanding issue  and
        that question was that of proportionality the  Secretary  of  State
        has established that the decision is proportionate. The family life
        relied upon partner fails for the reasons the Rules are not met. PE
        has contact with his children and this will have to continue on  an
        indirect basis unless they are able to holiday in  Greece.  It  has
        not been shown that the removal of PE will result in  unjustifiable
        harsh consequences for any  family  member  such  as  to  make  the
        decision disproportionate. The legitimate aim of the protection  of
        the public and deterrent element of deportation weigh strongly in a
        case in which a crime of violence was used for personal gain  which
        is not tolerated by the law or society in general.


    59. PE's appeal fails on all grounds.



Decision

    60. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.




   Anonymity.


    61. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  I
        continue that order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
