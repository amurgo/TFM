For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan whose appeal was  dismissed  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Devittie in a decision  promulgated  on  30th
    August 2018.  The judge set out his reasons for  coming  to  that  view
    concluding that while there was some evidence that the earnings met the
    required ï¿½18,600 threshold the Sponsor failed to give  answers  to  two
    very basic questions regarding his income and self-employment.

 2. The judge went on to consider Article 8 outside the Rules noting  there
    were no exceptional circumstances that had been drawn to his  attention
    and that he would dismiss the human "growth" in the appeal.

 3. Grounds of application were lodged  stating  that  the  bank  statement
    clearly reflected the Sponsor's self-employment income  and  employment
    income and the judge had not understood the  documents  correctly.   It
    was also argued that the judge had failed to consider the right engaged
    under Article 8 in that there was a child in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    consideration should have been given under Section 55  as  the  child's
    interest was paramount.  There had been no consideration by  the  judge
    as to the affect that the child remaining without his mother would have
    on his wellbeing.  The judge had dealt with  Article  8  in  two  short
    paragraphs which in all  fairness  did  not  justify  the  reasons  for
    dismissing the appeal.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Robertson
    in a decision dated 18th September 2019.  The judge noted  that  as  at
    the date of the hearing the Appellant and her husband had a  2-year-old
    British national son.  There had been no mention of the best  interests
    of the Appellant's son in the proportionality assessment and no mention
    of the Appellant's child at all in the decision.  It was not  known  if
    any evidence was tendered although there was mention of the son in  the
    Sponsor's and  Appellant's  joint  witness  statement.   Permission  to
    appeal was granted on the basis that the grounds were arguable.

 5. Thus, the matter came before me on the above date.

 6. Before me it was accepted by the Home Office that there was  a  British
    national son.

 7. Mrs Mughal said that there was an error of law in the judge failing  to
    consider the fact that there was a British child; as such the  decision
    should be set aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  where  the
    whole issue of the earnings and the best interests of the  child  could
    be properly ventilated and considered.

 8. For the Home Office Ms Everett said she  had  some  sympathy  with  the
    grounds because the judge had not dealt with the issue that there was a
    British citizen child.  Nevertheless, it was arguable that there was no
    material error of law and no error of law in the judge's finding on the
    financial resources of the Sponsor.  If the case had to be remitted  it
    should be remitted purely on Article 8 grounds.

 9. I reserved my decision.

Conclusions

10. The difficulty with this case is the way the judge has dealt  with  the
    Article 8 claim of the Appellant.  The decision is a brief one and  the
    judge said, in all the circumstances, that there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances from the facts before him. As he noted in paragraph 3  of
    his decision there was a son born in United Kingdom on 4th April  2016.
    Before me it was accepted that the child was British which  necessarily
    reflected the findings set out in the refusal letter that the Appellant
    had a genuine and subsisting relationship with a British partner.

11. It  was  therefore  incumbent  upon  the  judge  to  take  onboard  the
    proposition that Article 8 had to  embrace  the  consideration  of  the
    child's best interests as a primary consideration which  he  manifestly
    failed to do.

12. It has to be said that the joint witness statement of the Appellant and
    her partner is particularly brief and limited  in  its  terms  and  the
    judge was not assisted by that.  Nevertheless,  there  was  a  material
    error in law in not dealing fully with the Article 8 claim which was at
    least made to the judge if in rather weak terms.

13. The decision is plainly not safe because the  reasoning  is  inadequate
    and the decision must therefore be set aside.   Mrs  Mughal  sought  no
    more than a  remit  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which,  in  all  the
    circumstances, seems to me to be an appropriate disposal to the  appeal
    before me.  While I have some sympathy for  the  Home  Office  position
    that the findings of the judge in relation  to  the  financial  aspects
    should be kept intact, I think it better, in all the circumstances  and
    given the significant error made by the judge, for there to be a  fresh
    look at this case and to allow the appeal to be properly  presented  to
    the judge (not Judge Devittie) on the next occasion.

14. I am therefore setting aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in
    its entirety. No. findings of the First Tier  Tribunal  are  to  stand.
    Under Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice statement 7.2
    the nature and extent of the fact-finding necessary for the decision to
    be remade is such that it is appropriate to remit the case to the First-
    tier Tribunal.



Notice of Decision

15. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

16. I set aside the decision.

17. I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

18. There is no need for an anonymity order.
