                     DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE O'RYAN


                                   Between

                                     OO
                                     and
                                     AO
                         (anonymity direction made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms Rutherford, Counsel, instructed by Rotherham & Co
Solicitors For the Respondent:  Mrs Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    UPON hearing from Ms Rutherford of Counsel for the Appellant  and  from
    Mrs Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer for the Respondent

    AND UPON considering: the decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Moran dated 18 January 2018 dismissing the Appellants' appeals  against
    the decision of the Respondent dated 8 September  2017  refusing  their
    human rights claims; the Appellants' grounds of appeal dated 30 January
    2018; the grant of permission to appeal by  Judge  of  the  First  tier
    Tribunal Landes dated 13 February 2018; and the  Respondent's  Rule  24
    Response dated 16 March 2018

    AND UPON it being agreed between the parties that:

    (i)  in dismissing the appeal, the judge materially  erred  in  law  by
    failing, when considering the position  of  OO's  son,  SB,  a  British
    Citizen, to direct himself in law as to effect of the decision in  Ruiz
    Zambrano (European citizenship) [2011] EUECJ C-34/09;

    (ii) the effect of OO's removal from  the  United  Kingdom  to  Nigeria
    would be that SB would be obliged  to  leave  the  European  Union,  SB
    having no relationship with his father and there being no  other  carer
    for him in the United Kingdom, thus depriving SB with  of  the  genuine
    enjoyment of the substance of the rights attaching  to  the  status  of
    European Union citizen;

    (iii)    it would therefore not be reasonable to expect SB to leave the
    United Kingdom;

    (iv) OO has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with SB;

    (v)  applying s.117B(6) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,
    the public interest does not  require  OO's  removal  from  the  United
    Kingdom;

    (vi) it would thus amount to a disproportionate interference with  OO's
    rights under Article 8 ECHR to remove her from the United Kingdom;

    (vii)    where OO is to remain in the United Kingdom, the removal of AO
    from the United Kingdom would represent a disproportionate interference
    with the rights of both OO and AO under Article 8 ECHR;

    AND UPON the Tribunal being satisfied that it is  appropriate  to  make
    such an order.

    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, by consent,  under  Rule  39  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 that:

    (1)  The judge's decision is set aside.

    (2)  The Appellants' human rights appeals are allowed.
