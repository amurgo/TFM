                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   On 4th January this year the appellant, a Turkish  citizen  of  Kurdish
    ethnicity, came to the attention of the police in Milton Keynes, having
    arrived clandestinely by lorry.  On 5th January he was served  with  an
    IS 151A notice as an illegal entrant and, having  claimed  asylum,  was
    taken to Campsfield House.  There he underwent  a  Screening  Interview
    ('SCR') on 12th January.  Giving his date  of  birth  as  23rd  October
    1994, and his occupation as 'shepherd', the appellant said that at  the
    end of 2011 he had been arrested by the police on suspicion of  helping
    the PKK.  He was held for  about  one  hour  at  a  police  station  in
    Gaziantep and, although he was released without charge, he was tortured
    during his detention.   Fearing  a  repetition  of  this  torture,  the
    appellant came to the United Kingdom, where he has relatives.  He  gave
    the telephone number of his sister, Ms NG.

2.   The appellant gave a detailed account of his journey to  this  country.
    Leaving his native village on 17th December 2012, he travelled by coach
    to Istanbul, which took about 13 hours.  There his father handed him to
    an agent, who was paid E5,000.  The  agent  destroyed  the  appellant's
    identity card before putting him on board a lorry, which drove for five
    days before depositing  the  appellant  in  an  unknown  country.   The
    appellant continued his journey in another lorry,  ending  up  in  this
    country about a week later.

3.   On 30th January the appellant was assessed by two social  workers  from
    the London Borough  of  Waltham  Forest  concerning  his  age,  because
    subsequent to the SCR he had given his date of  birth  as  3rd  October
    1997, which would make him a minor.  The appellant was  now  living  in
    London with his aunt, although it was NG who  accompanied  him  to  the
    assessment.  The social workers got the impression  that  she  was  his
    cousin, an impression not corrected when the appellant was asked  about
    his siblings, and said that his sister, NG, was 6  years  old  and  was
    living with his parents in  Turkey.   His  relatives  in  this  country
    comprised aunts, uncles and cousins.  As to his age, the social workers
    concluded that the appellant was at least 18 years old.

4.   On 13th February the appellant signed a Witness  Statement  ('WS'),  in
    which he said that his ID card gave his date of birth as  20th  January
    1994, which was wrong.   According  to  what  he  had  heard  from  his
    parents, he was actually born on 3rd October 1997.  But his father  did
    not correct this; he did not know why.

5.   Also in the WS, the  appellant  said  that  he  was  arrested  on  17th
    November 2012 and held at the local gendarmerie for three days,  during
    which he was beaten  and  subjected  to  pressurized  cold  water.   On
    release, he had to report back every week, and bring information  about
    the PKK.  Because he had no information to give,  he  was  beaten  each
    time he reported.  His father decided that he should leave Turkey,  and
    around 14th December 2012 the appellant departed for  Istanbul,  whence
    he set off by lorry three days later.

6.   The appellant did not know, he continued, why  his  detention  on  17th
    November 2012 was stated at the SCR to have taken place  in  2011.   "I
    may", he said, "have  made  a  mistake  with  the  year.   I  am  quite
    forgetful of years and feel confused in mind most  of  the  time  after
    what happened to me in Turkey."

7.   At his substantive asylum  interview  ('AIR')  on  14th  February,  the
    appellant said that his sister, NG, was 24  years  old  and  living  in
    Crawley.  Indeed, she accompanied him to the interview.  The  appellant
    was questioned about the inconsistencies concerning when  he  was  born
    and when he was detained in Turkey.  Despite having said in his WS that
    the wrong date of birth (20th January 1994) had  been  put  on  his  ID
    ('Nufus') card, the appellant now insisted that the card had all  along
    given his date of birth as 3rd October 1997.  This was the  card  which
    the agent had taken and destroyed.

8.   As well as his sister, the appellant was accompanied to  the  interview
    by a legal representative and his own interpreter.  It was clarified at
    the outset that the appellant was detained not for one  hour  in  2011,
    but for  three  days  in  2012.   Relating  his  experiences  while  in
    detention,  the  appellant  said  that  he  had  been  taken  from  the
    gendarmerie to Gaziantep and put before a judge, but the judge released
    him for lack of evidence.

9.   On 4th March a  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter  ('RFRL')  was  produced,
    rejecting the asylum claim  because  of  the  inconsistencies  outlined
    above.  Notice of appeal was lodged with the First-tier Tribunal, and a
    Respondent's  Bundle  was  prepared,  which  included   the   Screening
    Interview of Ms NG in April 2009, when she had claimed asylum.  Listing
    her siblings on that occasion, she gave the appellant's age as 6.   But
    in the Bio-Data Information given on the same date,  the  appellant  is
    said to have been born in 1993.

10.  On 289th June the appeal came before Judge Andonian, who dismissed  it.
     Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought, principally  on
    the basis that  the  judge  had  not  taken  account  of  a  rival  age
    assessment included in the Appellant's Bundle, taking the view that the
    appellant was indeed born on 3rd October 1997.  A secondary ground  was
    that the judge had  not  paid  due  attention  to  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's sister, who gave evidence before him, had  been  recognised
    as a refugee for reasons similar to the appellant's  claim,  i.e.  ill-
    treatment as a perceived supporter of the PKK.  Permission was  granted
    because the Appellant's Bundle was before the judge, and he should have
    considered that report.

11.  When the appeal came  before  me  today,  Miss  Panagiotopoulou  strove
    valiantly to persuade me that Judge Andonian had made  material  errors
    of law, and she was ably rebutted by Mr Walker.   By  the  end  of  the
    hearing it was clear to me that no material error  had  been  made.   I
    shall give my reasons briefly below.

12.  To begin with, it is far from certain that the Appellant's  Bundle  was
    before Judge Andonian, or indeed that  the  appellant's  representative
    had it herself.  The bundle was stamped as received at Taylor House  on
    27th June, the day before the  hearing,  despite  directions  that  any
    documentary evidence was to be filed and  served  no  later  than  five
    working days before the hearing.  Trott & Gentry had had plenty of time
    to prepare the Appellant's Bundle.  Notice of the hearing had gone  out
    on 23rd April, by which time the age assessment by two  social  workers
    from Waltham Forest Community Services had been completed.  Someone  at
    Taylor House wrote "IJ Andonian 28/6/13" on  the  front  sheet  of  the
    bundle, but that does not mean it reached the fee-paid judge  in  time.
    That it did not is suggested by what Judge Andonian writes at paragraph
    8 of his determination, namely that the appellant's own testimony gives
    conflicting dates of  birth,  that  he  has  been  assessed  by  Social
    Services as over 18, and that he has provided no age assessment of  his
    own.  "His counsel", he records, "said that by looking at him one would
    not think that he is over 18."  The  appellant's  representative  would
    not have had recourse to such  a  forlorn  gambit  if  she  could  have
    pointed to an age assessment prepared by professionals, supporting  the
    appellant's contention that he was a minor.  It would seem that no  one
    in the hearing room was aware of the Appellant's Bundle.

13.  But even if the judge had perused the more recent  age  assessment,  it
    would have made no difference to the outcome.  Two  different  sets  of
    social workers, both under the aegis of  Waltham  Forest,  had  reached
    opposite views as to whether the appellant was a minor.  The  appellant
    himself had given conflicting evidence about his age.  At paragraph 13,
    the judge noted the discrepancy in Ms NG's Screening Interview and Bio-
    Data Information about the appellant's age.  The judge would still have
    been entitled to withhold, as he does at the foot of paragraph  8,  the
    benefit of the doubt vis-ï¿½-vis the appellant's age, taking into account
    that he did not find the appellant credible in other respects.   It  is
    not the case, as contended by the grounds,  that  the  judge's  adverse
    view of the appellant's credibility was based upon the disputed age.

14.  Miss Panagiotopoulou drew my attention to the  Nufus  card  faxed  from
    Turkey to the social workers (who describe it as a  birth  certificate)
    on 17th April, giving the appellant's date  of  birth  as  3rd  October
    1997.  This would not have persuaded Judge Andonian of the  reliability
    of the latter date.  On the contrary, the Nufus card itself is a wholly
    unreliable document.  Both at the SCR and the AIR,  the  appellant  was
    adamant that the agent took his Nufus card from him  in  December  last
    year and destroyed it.

15.  In any event, whether the appellant was 15 or 18 years old,  the  judge
    was equally entitled to find the  discrepancy  as  to  the  appellant's
    detention highly  damaging  to  his  credibility,  as  he  explains  at
    paragraph 10 of his determination.  At three  points  in  the  SCR  the
    appellant says that he was detained at the end  of  2011,  and  in  two
    places he says it was for one hour.  Miss Panagiotopoulou points to the
    explanation in the WS that the appellant gets confused about time,  but
    in his SCR the appellant was able to give  a  precise  account  of  his
    journey from Turkey the previous month.   If  his  detention  and  ill-
    treatment had taken place only a month before that, the appellant would
    have said so, and would not have set it back to the previous year.   He
    was also unlikely to get confused between one hour and three  days.   A
    15-year old was no more likely to get these basic facts wrong  than  an
    18-year old.

16.  At paragraph 11 Judge Andonian refers to  the  appellant's  account  in
    the AIR of being released without charge by a judge in Gaziantep.  In a
    statement in the  Appellant's  Bundle,  not  seen  by  the  judge,  the
    appellant now says that it was not a judge,  but  a  military  officer.
    Had the judge seen this amendment, it would  only  have  confirmed  his
    negative view of the appellant's credibility.  In the AIR it could  not
    be clearer that a judge in a courtroom setting is being  talked  about.
    Miss Panagiotopoulou draws attention to the  appellant's  complaint  at
    the end of the AIR that  he  feels  dizzy  and  is  sweating,  but  the
    interviewing officer notes that neither the appellant nor  any  of  the
    three adults who accompanied him asked for a break at any point in  the
    interview.

17.  At paragraph 13 Judge Andonian notes that there  is  no  evidence  that
    the appellant and his sister are related as  siblings.   That  a  doubt
    about this should have arisen can be ascribed  to  the  age  assessment
    carried out on 30th January, when the appellant was  accompanied  by  a
    young lady said to be his cousin, and said that his sister, NG,  was  6
    years old and living in Turkey.  In any event,  one  cannot  fault  the
    judge's observation that "the fact that the appellant's sister has been
    granted refugee status for a well founded fear of persecution does  not
    mean that the appellant  has  a  well-founded  fear."   The  judge  was
    entitled to disbelieve Ms NG's testimony that her brother is wanted  in
    Turkey.

18.  The upshot of all this is that the First-tier Tribunal did not make  an
    error of law, and its determination therefore stands.



     DECISION

     The appeal is dismissed.
