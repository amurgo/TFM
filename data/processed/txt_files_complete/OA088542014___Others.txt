For the Appellants:    Mr P. Saini, counsel instructed by Mitchell & Co
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                             DECISION & REASONS

1.    The hearing of this appeal first came before the  Upper  Tribunal  for
hearing on 22 July 2015. In a decision of the same date the  Upper  Tribunal
found that First Tier Tribunal Judge Andonian had erred  materially  in  law
and adjourned the appeal for a resumed hearing on 20 August 2015. The  error
of law decision and reasons are appended to this decision.

Hearing

2.    At the resumed hearing, Mr Saini produced a typed  transcript  of  his
handwritten notes of  the  hearing  before  the  First  Tier  Tribunal,  his
handwritten notes having been sent to the Upper  Tribunal  in  advance.  The
parties agreed that the finding of fact by the First Tier Tribunal that  the
Appellants were extended family members of an  EEA  national  was  preserved
and the only question that arose was one of dependency cf Dauhoo for  the  4
possibilities. Mr Saini handed up a money transfer receipt  dated  12  March
2015. Mr Whitwell handed in a printout of SS postcodes for Southend  on  Sea
which was potentially relevant to the  landlord's  address  on  the  tenancy
agreement of SS17 0AN. Mr Saini was given time to take instructions on  this
document.

3.    The Sponsor, Mr Muhammad Tayyab Ramay, was  called  to  give  evidence
and confirmed his statement of 26 February 2015.  He  was  asked  about  his
landlord's postcode on his tenancy agreement and stated that  he  had  never
been to his landlord's address or had cause to write to him.  He  said  that
his property was rented indirectly through an agent, Lake Star  property  on
Romford Road and that he met the landlord after he and his wife  rented  the
property. The landlord lives outside London  and  owns  16  properties.  The
Sponsor did not know the landlord's address. He stated that his parents  and
brother's names were on the tenancy agreement to show  they  had  permission
to live there.

4.    In respect of his father,  the  Sponsor  confirmed  that  he  has  had
diabetes for 15 years.  In  2013,  his  father's  toe  was  removed  due  to
gangrene. His father receives �35 a month in the form of  a  pension  as  he
was a teacher. His mother is a housewife and has never worked.  His  brother
is making efforts to get a job but has not got one. He  completed  a  Degree
in Banking & Commerce and wants to do a Masters in Commerce. In addition  to
the money transfer receipt dated 12 March 2015, the  Sponsor  said  that  he
had sent three or four money transfers this year  including  that  one,  for
differing sums of money, altogether for �3-4000. He sent the  money  to  his
brother because his father was ill.

5.    In cross- examination, the Sponsor was asked  what  he  and  his  wife
would do if the appeal is unsuccessful and he stated that he  did  not  know
but he would possibly leave the United Kingdom. Last  time  his  father  was
ill he travelled to see him even though his work did not give  him  holiday.
He confirmed that his father owned his  own  property.  In  respect  of  his
living expenses he said that the Doctor and medicine are not free; that  his
father calls him and he sends money for this. He  said  that  on  a  monthly
basis his parents' and brother's living expenses,  including  his  brother's
university fees were �300-�400 excluding medical fees. His  father  gave  up
work three and a half years ago around the time that he came to  the  United
Kingdom. Prior to that  his  father  was  earning  30,000  Pakistani  rupees
equivalent to approximately �300 per month and that he worked as  a  private
tutor as well in the evenings at a private academy.  The  Sponsor  confirmed
that his father has a bank account but he does not have savings as he  spent
them [10,000 Pakistani rupees] on his sister's wedding.  He  said  that  his
sister is not working and her husband is in a low  paid  job  and  they  are
unable to support his parents.

6.    The Sponsor's wife, Aneta Ramay was then called to give evidence.  She
confirmed her statement and that she resided with the Sponsor  at  6  Bronte
Close. They married on 20 March 2012. When  cross-examined  by  Mr  Whitwell
she was asked whether she knew anything about her father in law's  financial
circumstances in Pakistan and she said that he is retired; he was a  teacher
and has been retired for 3 and a half years. He receives a pension of  about
�35 a month. She said that her  mother-in-law  does  not  work  and  is  not
educated. She said that they do not have enough money and depend on her  and
her husband as �35 a month is not  enough  to  survive.  In  response  to  a
question from the Tribunal the witness stated that she supported her  family
in Poland as her mother is disabled. She said that would go to Poland  every
6 months and would take �400 with her when she went.

7.    Mr Whitwell then  made  submissions.  He  stated  that  the  test  for
dependency was set out in Lim. He submitted that the  question  that  needed
to be decided was one of fact  and  that  was  whether  the  Appellants  are
dependent on the Sponsor and his wife in the United Kingdom.  He  said  that
he had two observations to make: (i) despite the fact  that  quite  detailed
financial circumstances of the Sponsor and his wife  had  been  provided  in
terms of their bank accounts and P60's, there was very limited  evidence  in
relation to Pakistan and this was essentially limited to the oral  evidence;
(ii) in the visa application form at question 66 when asked how  much  money
was spent, the response was recorded as 7000 Pakistan rupees. Based  on  the
evidence in respect of the money transfer receipts however  and  given  that
150 Pakistan rupees is equivalent to �1, �300 = 45,000 Pakistani rupees.  He
submitted that the Sponsor's evidence was more stark than  the  position  as
set out in the visa application form. He further  submitted  that,  even  on
the evidence of the Sponsor his family were  struggling  financially  before
his father stopped working as he had taken a  second  job.  He  acknowledged
that if the Appellants can show that their essential living  needs  are  met
by receipt of money sent by  the  Sponsor  and  his  wife  from  the  United
Kingdom their appeal should be allowed.

8.    Mr Saini submitted on behalf of the Appellants that  essential  living
costs would not include University fees or medical  expenses.  He  submitted
that the visa application form had been completed by a  non-professional  or
lay person who had not appreciated that it was important  to  give  accurate
evidence about costs and that if there  was  a  discrepancy  or  fluctuation
this was not due to fabrication.  There  was  no  inconsistency  apart  from
this. He submitted that the  question  was  one  of  pure  fact:  was  there
dependency or not. In respect of Lim he submitted that even if he was  wrong
about the figure of living costs, given the Sponsor's father's age  and  the
fact that he is diabetic and unable to work, his  mother  has  never  worked
and his brother has applied for work but cannot get  work  and  is  doing  a
Masters degree. He submitted that they  fall  within  dependency  by  choice
even if not dependency by necessity. He submitted that it  is  necessity  as
the Sponsor's father requires medication. The amount that they need a  month
exceeds �35 as their living  costs  are  �46  and  this  is  sufficient  for
dependent standards and it is necessary for the  Sponsor  and  his  wife  to
supplement his father's pension  income.  He  submitted  that  on  the  pure
factual question dependency is made out.  In  respect  of  the  caselaw,  Mr
Saini relied on Dauhoo and submitted that the Sponsor's brother is  8(1)  or
(a) seeking to join Sponsor here and that this  only  the  first  limb  that
needs to be met in terms of Dauhoo as it is an entry clearance  application.
He accepted that the  "same  household"  requirement  was  not  met  as  the
Sponsor was not married to an EEA national at that time. In  response  to  a
question from the Upper Tribunal as to  when  dependency  began,  he  stated
that the marriage between the Sponsor and his wife took place  on  20  March
2012 and so the possibility first arose at that  date  and  that  money  was
first sent on 3 April 2012 according to the  itemized  list  dated  February
2014. He also relied on the decision in Moneke at headnotes 1, 3 and 5.

The Relevant Law

9.    Article 3(2)(a) of Directive 2004/38/EC and Regulation 8(2)(a) of  the
Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  make  provision  for  the  rights  of
movement and residence of  other  or  extended  family  members  of  an  EEA
national.

10.   The headnote in Moneke (EEA - OFMs)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  341  (IAC)
provides:

    "i.    A person claiming to be an OFM under Article 3(2)  of  Directive
    2004/38/EC may either be a dependant or a member of  the  household  of
    the EEA national: they are alternative ways of qualifying as an OFM.

    ii.    In either case the dependency or  membership  of  the  household
    must be on a person who is an EEA national at the  material  time.  For
    this reason it is essential that tribunal  judges  establish  when  the
    sponsor acquired EEA nationality.

    iii.   By contrast with Article 2(2) family members, an OFM  must  show
    qualification as such before arrival in  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
    application to join the EEA national who is resident here.

    iv.    Membership of a household has the meaning set  out  in  KG  (Sri
    Lanka) [2008] EWCA Civ 13 and Bigia & Ors [2009] EWCA Civ 79;  that  is
    to say it imports living for some period of time under the  roof  of  a
    household that can be said to be that of the EEA national  for  a  time
    when he or she had such nationality.  That  necessarily  requires  that
    whilst in possession of such nationality the family  member  has  lived
    somewhere in the world in the same country as the EEA national, but not
    necessarily in an EEA state.

    v.     By contrast the dependency on an EEA national can be  dependency
    as a result of the material remittances sent by the EEA national to the
    family member, without the pair  of  them  having  lived  in  the  same
    country at that time before making those remittances.

    vi.    The country from which the  OFM  has  come  can  be  either  the
    country from which he or she has come to the United Kingdom or  his  or
    her country of origin.

    vii.   Notwithstanding  the  preliminary  reference  to  the  Court  of
    Justice made by the Upper Tribunal in MR &  Ors  (EEA  extended  family
    members) Bangladesh [2010] UKUT 449 (IAC) tribunal judges  can  proceed
    to determine OFM appeals in accordance with the guidance given  by  the
    Upper Tribunal in this and related cases, making sure to make  findings
    of fact based on a rigorous examination of the evidence.

    viii.  Where relevant, findings need also to be made on whether  it  is
    appropriate to issue a residence card in accordance with the discretion
    afforded by regulation 17(4)  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006.

    ix.    In deciding whether a person falls within the material scope  of
    regulation 8 of the 2006 Regulations, policy considerations relating to
    such matters as the appellant's immigration history, the impact  of  an
    adverse decision on the exercise by the EEA  national  of  his  or  her
    Treaty rights, etc  are  irrelevant.  Such  policy  considerations  are
    relevant, however, to the exercise of regulation 17(4) discretion.

The Upper Tribunal further clarified at [41]  that  dependency  is  not  the
same as mere receipt of some  financial  assistance  from  the  sponsor  and
adopted the approach in the Entry Clearance Instructions in  force  at  that
time held that: 'Financial dependency should be interpreted as meaning  that
the person needs financial  support  from  the  EEA  national  or  his/  her
spouse/civil partner in order to meet  his/her  essential  needs  -  not  in
order to have a certain level of income."

11.   In Dauhoo (EEA Regulations - reg 8(2)) [2012]  UKUT  00079  (IAC)  the
Upper Tribunal held, in the headnote, that:

    "Under the scheme set out in reg 8 (2)  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006, a person can succeed  in  establishing
    that he or she is an "extended  family  member"  in  any  one  of  four
    different ways, each of which requires proving  a  relevant  connection
    both prior to arrival in the UK and in the UK:

    i.     prior dependency and present dependency

    ii.    prior membership of a household  and  present  membership  of  a
    household

    iii.   prior dependency and present membership of a household;

    iv.    prior membership of a household and present dependency.

    It is not necessary, therefore, to show prior and present connection in
    the same capacity: i.e. dependency- dependency or household membership-
    household membership ((i) or (ii) above). A person may also qualify  if
    able  to show (iii) or (iv)."

12.   In Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rahman [2012]  3  CMLR
55, the CJEU held at 32-35:

    "32. ... it is to be noted that, as  follows  from  recital  6  in  the
    directive's preamble, the objective of [article 3(2)] is  to  'maintain
    the unity of the family in a broader sense' by facilitating  entry  and
    residence for persons who are not included in the definition of  family
    members of a Union citizen contained in art.2(2) of  Directive  2004/38
    but who nevertheless maintain close and stable family ties with a Union
    citizen on account of specific factual circumstances, such as  economic
    dependence, being a member of the household or serious health grounds.

    33. It is clear that such ties may exist without the family  member  of
    the Union citizen having resided in the same State as that  citizen  or
    having been a dependant of that citizen shortly before or at  the  time
    when the latter settled in the host  State.  On  the  other  hand,  the
    situation of dependence must exist,  in  the  country  from  which  the
    family member concerned comes, at the time when he applies to join  the
    Union citizen on whom he is dependent.

    34. In the main  proceedings,  it  is  for  the  national  tribunal  to
    establish, on the basis of the guidance as to  interpretation  provided
    above, whether the respondents in the main proceedings were  dependants
    of the Union citizen ... in the country from which they have  come  ...
    at the time when they applied to join her in the United Kingdom. It  is
    only if they can prove that dependence in the country from  which  they
    have come ... that the host Member State will have to facilitate  their
    entry and residence in accordance with art.3(2) ....

    35. In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the third  and  fourth
    question referred is that,  in  order  to  fall  within  the  category,
    referred to in art.3(2) of Directive 2004/38, of family members who are
    'dependants' of a Union citizen, the situation of dependence must exist
    in the country from which the family member  concerned  comes,  at  the
    very least at the time when he applies to join  the  Union  citizen  on
    whom he is dependent."

13.   In Lim (EEA -dependency) [2013] UKUT 00437 (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal
held inter alia as follows:

    "24.   Even though it seems clear that not  all  of  the  sum  sent  in
    remittances (amounting to around �150-�200 a month) is for the claimant
    (some is intended to help support  her  mother  and  the  10  year  old
    grandchild), for dependency to arise it is not necessary that a  person
    be wholly or even mainly  dependent.  If  a  person  requires  material
    support for essential needs in part, that is sufficient."

My findings

14.   The only  issue  before  me  was  whether  the  three  Appellants  are
dependent  upon  their  Sponsor  and  his   EEA   national   wife.   It   is
uncontroversial  that  this  is  defined  in  the  jurisprudence   and   the
Respondent's policy instructions as  meaning  that  the  Appellants  require
financial support in order to meet their essential needs.

15.   I have considered the written and oral evidence  of  the  Sponsor,  Mr
Muhammad Tayyab Ramay  and  his  wife,  Aneta  Ramay  in  this  respect.  Mr
Whitwell submitted that the evidence in relation  to  Pakistan  was  limited
and the Sponsor's evidence as to the Appellants'  requirements  was  starker
than the position as set out in the visa application form  at  question  66.
The form is dated 19  March  2014.  At  question  66,  in  response  to  the
question: "How much do you spend each month  on  living  costs?"  the  first
Appellant responded  "PKR  7000."  At  that  time  this  was  equivalent  to
approximately �46. I note  that  in  response  to  question  63,  the  first
Appellant stated that he was retired and in response to question 65 that  he
received �200 per month from other sources - family and friends.

16.   I do not consider that  the  Sponsor's  evidence  differed  materially
from the  information  in  the  visa  application  form  and  I  accept  the
Sponsor's evidence that his father, the first Appellant, receives a  monthly
pension of �35 and that the money he and his wife provide is used  to  cover
not only his father's medical bills and his brother's  University  fees  but
also to meet the Appellants essential living needs. The  Sponsor's  evidence
was as to the current  position  ie  this  year  rather  than  the  date  of
decision and it is clear that his father's  health  has  deteriorated  since
the amputation of his toe in  2013  and  this  has  necessitated  additional
remittances. Whilst I accept that the evidence relating to  the  Appellants'
income absent remittances is limited, Mr Whitwell did not  seek  to  suggest
that the evidence of the Sponsor and his wife was not credible and I  accept
their evidence as to the Appellants' means, noting that it  was  consistent,
not only with each other but with the supporting documentary evidence.

17.   It is clear from the decision of the CJEU in Secretary  of  State  for
the Home Department v Rahman [2012] 3 CMLR 55 that it not necessary for  the
Appellants to have resided with the EEA national in the same  State  or  the
same household but only that the situation of dependency exists at the  time
the application to join the Sponsor was made.

18.   The Sponsor and his wife's evidence as to remittances in the  form  of
money transfer receipts is corroborated by the  evidence  at  40-45  of  the
Appellants' bundle showing that, on average, �200 a month was  sent  to  the
Appellants starting from  3  April  2012,  which  post  dates  the  marriage
between the Sponsor and his wife on 20 March 2012 and thus can  properly  be
taken into account. The last pre-decision receipt is dated 17  January  2014
and is for �200.

19.   The relevant date is the date of the decision of the  Entry  Clearance
Officer 3 April 2014 and I find  that  at  that  date  the  Appellants  were
financially dependent upon the Sponsor and his EEA national  wife  in  order
to meet their essential needs.

20.   For the reasons set out above, I allow the appeal.

Conclusion

21.   The decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge having been  set  aside,
I remake the decision and allow the appeal.
