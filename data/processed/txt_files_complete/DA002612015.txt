Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    The respondent did not appear and was not
represented
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent to this appeal, hereinafter "the claimant",  has  already
    been removed from the United Kingdom.  On 13 October 2015,  a  few  days
    before the hearing,  I  received  a  letter  from  claimant's  unmarried
    partner apologising for her absence and explaining that  she  could  not
    attend to support the claimant's appeal because she and  their  son  had
    removed from the United Kingdom and she did not have the money to return
    for the purpose of the hearing.

 2. The letter then set  out  in  passionate  terms  the  inconvenience  and
    distress caused to her  and  her  child  by  reason  of  the  claimant's
    removal.  She said how they had  "lost  everything".   The  letter  made
    little attempt to engage with legal submissions but did express the view
    that she could not understand why the claimant had  been  removed.   She
    said that she was living with her mother and had  no  contact  with  the
    claimant since his deportation.

 3. The appellant in  this  case,  hereinafter  the  "Secretary  of  State",
    appeals with permission a decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  allowing
    his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of  State  on  8  April
    2015 to make an order for his removal with reference to Regulation 19(3)
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulation  2006  following
    his being made the subject of a deportation order on 13 March 2015.

 4. I remind myself that my primary task is not to decide if the  claimant's
    appeal against deportation should be allowed but to decide  whether  the
    Secretary of State has shown that the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to
    allow the appeal is wrong in law.

 5. The claimant has the two disadvantages of being absent from  the  United
    Kingdom and unrepresented. I am not aware of his  having  applied  under
    paragraph 24AA of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal for an order suspending his removal until his  appeal  was
    finally decided. Even so, it is fitting to endeavour to show the highest
    standards of fairness.

 6. The Secretary of State's reasons for making the decision are set out  in
    the decision dated 5 March 2015 and in a supplementary letter  dated  16
    June 2015.

 7. The decision to make a deportation order notes that  the  claimant  says
    that he arrived in the United Kingdom in 2005 and  continues  "you  have
    not submitted any evidence of your arrival in the UK".  I take  this  to
    mean that the claimant had not submitted any  evidence  beyond  his  own
    assertion.  The Secretary  of  State  noted,  fairly,  that  as  an  EEA
    national he would not have  been  subject  to  immigration  control.  It
    follows that there is nothing to the claimant's detriment in there being
    no record of his arrival although he probably should have applied for  a
    residence card soon after arriving.

 8. The decision then deals with the claimant's criminal history.

 9. He has been in trouble in the Czech Republic.

10. On 4 September 1995 he was given a suspended sentence of  seven  months'
    imprisonment and put  on  probation  for  offences  of  theft,  criminal
    damage, unauthorised use of another person's property and an attempt  to
    commit a crime.

11. On 30 April 1996 he was sent to prison for fourteen months for  offences
    of theft and unauthorised use  of  property  belonging  to  another  and
    criminal damage.

12. On 17 December 1997 he was convicted of rape,  theft,  unauthorised  use
    of property belonging to another, attempt to commit a crime,  damage  to
    property of others, being an accessory in criminal  damage  and  matters
    described as "two counts of offender".  He was sent to  prison  for  six
    years six months and put on probation for a further five  years  of  his
    release.

13. On 26 May 2003 he was convicted of theft and fined 10,000 CZK.

14. On 22 April 2004 he was sent to prison for ten months for  theft,  being
    an accomplice and accessory in  criminal  activity  and  an  attempt  to
    commit a crime.

15. There is then a break of more than six years when there is no record  of
    his having committed any offences.

16.  The  next  criminal  sanction  recorded  was  at  the  North  Hampshire
    Magistrates' Court on 13 October 2011 when he was  sentenced  100  hours
    unpaid work  and  ordered  to  pay  ï¿½85  for  "failing  to  comply  with
    notification". He was convicted of the offence in October 2010.

17. In the explanatory letter the Secretary of State said that the  claimant
    had not established  continuous  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    accordance with the 2006 Regulations  and  in  particular  she  did  not
    accept that the claimant had provided any evidence of exercising  treaty
    rights for a continuous period of five  years.   The  claimant  accepted
    that he had been unemployed in the United Kingdom.  A  person  does  not
    exercises a treaty right merely by reason of being unemployed.

18. The Secretary of State then decided that deportation  was  justified  on
    grounds of public policy or public security.

19. The letter shows that the Secretary of State expressly reminded  herself
    of the requirements of Regulation 21(5)  and  in  particular  that  "the
    personal conduct of the  person  concerned  must  represent  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental
    interests of society".

20. The letter then noted that the Secretary  of  State  did  not  know  the
    exact circumstances of the claimant's convictions but did note  that  he
    had been convicted of rape and that his sentence of imprisonment had not
    brought to an end his criminal behaviour.  At paragraph 25 the Secretary
    of State said:

         "As noted above, you were convicted of rape in the  Czech  Republic
         on 17 December 1997.  While the Home Office has  seen  no  evidence
         that you have repeated this serious offence in the United  Kingdom,
         you have shown by your subsequent convictions in the Czech Republic
         that you present a current risk of re-offending.  It  is  therefore
         considered that the potential exists  for  you  to  commit  further
         offences of this  nature  in  the  future,  and  that  you  pose  a
         significant and unacceptable risk of harm to females in the  United
         Kingdom."

21. The Secretary of State then noted that the  claimant  had  not  provided
    evidence that he had, for example,  attended  a  programme  of  enhanced
    thinking skills or a victim awareness course and decided that it was not
    reasonable to leave the public vulnerable to  the  effects  of  his  re-
    offending (this presumably is a reference to the public  in  the  United
    Kingdom).

22. At paragraph 28 the Secretary of State said:

         "All the available evidence indicates that you have a propensity to
         re-offend  and  that  you  represent   a   genuine,   present   and
         sufficiently  serious  threat  to  the  public  to   justify   your
         deportation on grounds of public policy."

23. The letter then addressed the need for decisions under  the  Regulations
    to be proportionate and to consider rehabilitation.  The EEA Regulations
    are considered expressly at paragraph 38 and we are told:

         "You have committed serious criminal offences in the Czech Republic
         and, as explained above, there is a real risk that you may reoffend
         in the future.   Account  has  been  taken  of  the  considerations
         outlined in EEA Regulation 21(6).  Nevertheless, given  the  threat
         of serious harm that you pose to the public it is  considered  that
         your personal circumstances do not preclude your deportation  being
         pursued.  It is considered that  the  decision  to  deport  you  is
         proportionate and in accordance with the principles  of  Regulation
         21(5)."

24. Article 8 of the European Convention  on  Human  Rights  was  considered
    expressly and the Secretary of State considered  the  Immigration  Rules
    and Section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002,
    although only to say, correctly, that they do not apply in EEA cases, as
    well as the need to make the best interests of the  claimant's  child  a
    primary consideration before deciding that  the  claimant  ought  to  be
    deported.

25. At paragraph 70 the Secretary of State decided that there would  not  be
    any real risk of serious irreversible harm if  he  removed  pending  the
    outcome of any appeal.

26. In the supplementary letter of 16  June  2015  the  Secretary  of  State
    commented on evidence produced by  the  claimant  showing  that  he  had
    worked for Hawk Engineering but concluded this only showed  work  for  a
    period of three years, not five.

27. At paragraph 18 the Secretary of State says:

         "You have an extensive criminal history  in  Czech  Republic  which
         demonstrates that you  present  a  risk  of  re-offending  and  the
         potential exists for you to commit further offences in the  future.
         Rape is a serious offence and while the Home  Office  has  seen  no
         evidence that you have repeated this serious offence in the UK, you
         have shown by your subsequent convictions in  Czech  Republic  that
         you pose a significant and unacceptable risk of harm to the  public
         and in particular to females in the United Kingdom."

28. I have perused  carefully  the  list  of  previous  convictions  in  the
    Secretary  of  State's  papers  that  appear  to  have  come  from   the
    authorities in the Czech Republic.  I am most concerned about the  entry
    dated 22 April 2004 at the District Court at Jicin  for  an  offence  of
    theft.  Under the heading "Sentence" I read the word  "pardon"  -  date:
    16.11.2009".  This word does not appear under the record  of  the  other
    convictions.  I do not understand what it means  and  am  aware  that  a
    great deal could have got lost in translation but I  do  wonder  if  the
    conviction relied on in April 2004 ought to be relied on at all.

29. Notwithstanding the above concerns I cannot agree  with  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge that the claimant has proved  that  he  has  five  years'
    lawful  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  exercising  treaty  rights.
    Certainly he has been in the United Kingdom exercising treaty rights  by
    working for about three years.  Clearly he has  strong  links  with  the
    United Kingdom.  At the date of decision he had a family, a home  and  a
    car there.  It is also clear that he has been engaged in  some  kind  of
    economic activity by trading on eBay.  I cannot agree that this supports
    the conclusion that for a period of five years he has been  continuously
    resident in the United Kingdom and exercising treaty rights.  I  do  not
    accept without more that petty trading on eBay is sufficient  and  there
    really is no evidence of anything else. He did not argue,  for  example,
    that he was energetically looking for work. Neither is it clear that the
    claimant' resided continuously in the United Kingdom.  With  respect  to
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge I find that he erred  in  concluding  that
    the claimant had established five years' continuous residence.

30. This has no impact  whatsoever  on  his  finding  that  the  appellant's
    conduct does not represent "a genuine and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting the fundamental interests of society".

31. The First-tier Tribunal Judge may have  mudded  the  water  slightly  at
    paragraph 21 where he said:

         "It might have been arguable that his removal, as a past  defaulter
         from requirements relating to the  sex  offenders  register,  would
         have been justified, had  he  not  accrued  a  right  of  permanent
         residence in this country."

32. The difficulty is that although it might have been arguable it  was  not
    argued.  It has never been  the  Secretary  of  State's  case  that  the
    claimant should be deported because of his failure  to  co-operate  with
    the requirements  relating  to  the  sex  offenders'  register.  Knowing
    nothing about the circumstances of the breach other than the  fact  that
    they occurred I have to say that I find the omission  extraordinary  but
    it may be that it only seems extraordinary because I  do  not  know  the
    circumstances.  The claimant has not filled in the gap but there  is  no
    reason why he should have filled in the gap.  He had no reason to  think
    it was an issue as the Secretary of  State  had  not  relied  upon  that
    conviction.

33. This hypothetical observation in paragraph 21 does not, in my  judgment,
    in any way cloud the finding at paragraph 19 that the claimant's conduct
    did not represent a genuine and sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting
    the fundament interests of society.

34. Further the finding was not  challenged  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

35. In fact I agree with the First-tier Tribunal's finding  but  even  if  I
    disagreed with it completely or regarded it as perverse or bizarre there
    would be little I could do about it because it had not  been  challenged
    to the grounds.

36. At ground  14  the  Secretary  of  State  contends,  "the  legal  errors
    identified above are of central materiality to the appeal".  This  might
    be read with paragraph 13 which is the quotation from  paragraph  21  of
    the Decision to indicate some dissatisfaction with the finding about the
    nature of the threat to society.  For the reasons given  above  it  does
    not.  The First-tier Tribunal was  simply  acknowledging  that  a  point
    might have been argued.

37. Mr Clarke did not apply to amend the  grounds.   I  think  it  extremely
    unlikely that I would have given permission given the claimant's absence
    from the United Kingdom and that he is not represented.  It  would  have
    represented a major change at this late stage and  would  probably  have
    been unfair to the absent and unrepresented litigant.

38. It follows that any  error  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  its
    assessment of the degree of protection to which the claimant is entitled
    is completely irrelevant as the Secretary of State's claim fails at  the
    first hurdle.  Even on the lowest level of  protection  on  the  judge's
    finding, which is unchallenged, the claimant cannot be removed.

39. I wish to make it plain that I identify wholly  with  Judge  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's finding on this point.  I do not see  how  a  conviction
    for an offence of rape in 1997 can support a conclusion that a person is
    a danger to society now in 2015 without more.  The  Secretary  of  State
    relied on more.  She relied on two convictions for dishonesty  the  most
    recent one being in 2004.  That just will not do.  If there  are  better
    reasons for the decision they were not relied upon.

40. However I should add that, as the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  found  and
    as the Secretary of State declined to challenge, the  Decision  did  not
    take account of the claimant's conviction in 2011 for failing to report.
    If that conviction is thought to be  important  then  the  Secretary  of
    State might want to make a further decision to deport  the  claimant.  I
    see nothing about this  decision  or  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that would, of itself, prevent a further  decision  on  grounds
    not relied upon in the decision that is the subject of this appeal.

41. It follows therefore that I dismiss  the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal
    against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision stands.
