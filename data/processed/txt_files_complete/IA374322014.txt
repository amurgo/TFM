                                   NOTICE

1.   The Appellant appealed against a decision of the  Respondent,  dated  9
    September 2014.  The appeal was listed for hearing on  27  April  2015.
    On 24 April 2015 the Appellant by his solicitors Fletcher Dervish &  Co
    indicated that the Appellant did not wish to pursue the appeal.  A  fax
    diagnostic confirmed withdrawal of the immigration appeal on  24  April
    2015.

2.   At the hearing on 27 April 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge R  G  Walters
    (the judge) proceeded, in the absence of the  parties,  to  decide  the
    appeal and dismissed the same.

3.   At that stage there was no appeal  for  the  judge  to  determine.   In
    those circumstances the judge's decision was a nullity.

No anonymity direction is made.
