                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Plumptre ('the Judge') promulgated on 22 February 2017 in which the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal, finding it be proportionate
        to deport the appellant from the United Kingdom.



Background


     2. The Judge records that the appellant is  a  citizen  of  the  Ivory
        Coast born on 25 May 1997, but also provides evidence  of  criminal
        convictions all in the name  of  Justin  Okiere  N'Gata  a  Belgium
        national born on 25 December 1976 together with a  Change  of  Name
        Deed referred to at [2] of the decision under challenge.
     3. The Judge noted the appellant may have entered the  United  Kingdom
        in either May 2000 or possibly February 1998. The Judge  noted  the
        appellant in his witness statement claimed he  entered  the  United
        Kingdom at the later date aged 21 although the Home Office  records
        also show he first claimed to have arrived on the earlier date.
     4. The Judge notes the appellant's immigration history from [3] noting
        that on 26 March 2017 in the identity of N'Gata the  appellant  was
        convicted in his  absence  of  conspiracy  to  obtain  property  by
        deception and sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment. On  29  September
        2011, the appellant was issued with an Ivory Coast passport in  the
        name appearing at the head to this decision and  on  19  June  2012
        married a Belgium national. On 10  July  2012,  the  appellant  was
        granted a Residence Card in recognition of the right to  reside  in
        the United Kingdom as the spouse  of  an  EEA  national  exercising
        treaty rights in the UK.
     5. The appellant had written from HMP Canterbury to the respondent  to
        support his claim to have  been  in  the  UK  since  February  1998
        enclosing a copy of a Belgian passport. A series  of  letters  were
        written in 2010. On 31 January 2013, the Belgian passport was  sent
        to the Belgian Embassy by the Home Office to seek clarification  as
        to whether or not it was genuine. The appellant  claimed  he  is  a
        Belgium national who would therefore be  deported  to  Belgium.  In
        February 2013, the Belgian Embassy  confirmed  the  passport  is  a
        forgery.
     6. On 25 March 2013, a notice of liability to automatic deportation as
        a non-EEA national was issued to  the  appellant  although  in  his
        response to the Home  Office  the  appellant  maintained  he  is  a
        Belgium national.
     7. On 11 April 2013,  the  appellant  was  issued  with  a  notice  of
        restriction requiring him to report although he  failed  to  report
        and all letters sent to his  address  were  returned  to  the  Home
        Officers undelivered. On 15 April 2016, the appellant was convicted
        at Woolwich Crown Court for possessing a controlled article for use
        in  fraud  and  was  sentenced  to  16  weeks'  imprisonment.   The
        forfeiture and destruction of the false French driving  licence  he
        possessed was ordered and deportation recommended.
     8. The appellant continued to  maintain  in  2013,  through  his  then
        representatives, that he is a Belgium national whose  identity  was
        that set out above as the AKA name and that section 32  of  the  UK
        Borders Act 2007 did not apply to him.
     9. The respondent made a deportation order  in  the  name  of  Gabriel
        Kowadjo Boni Dadie dated 12 May  2015  in  relation  to  which  the
        appellant's  current  representatives,  A.   Bajwa   &   Co,   made
        submissions to revoke the deportation order. On 23 September  2016,
        the respondent wrote to the appellant giving reasons for the making
        of the deportation order and serving the signed  deportation  order
        on the same date.  The previous deportation order signed and served
        on 18 May 2016 had been revoked. That was a deportation order  made
        pursuant to the EEA Regulations 2006. The current deportation order
        is made pursuant to the UK Borders Act 2007.
    10. The appellant appealed the decision  on  the  basis  that  he  fell
        within the exception to automatic deportation  as  a  person  whose
        removal from the United Kingdom would breach a Convention  right  -
        Article  8  ECHR,  as  deportation  will  be   a   disproportionate
        interference with his right to family life with his wife, a Belgium
        national, and his two sons born in 2005 and 2013.
    11. Having set out procedural details and  relevant  legal  provisions,
        the Judge noted at [38] that the appellant appeared  in  person  at
        the hearing accompanied by his wife. Although A. Bajwa & Co were on
        file there was no appearance and  no  explanation  for  their  non-
        attendance at that time. The appellant requested an adjournment  to
        enable him to have more time  to  raise  funds  to  pay  for  legal
        representation as he could not raise all the money  the  solicitors
        had asked him to pay for their attendance at the hearing.
    12. The Judge noted in  the  same  paragraph  that  in  response  to  a
        question put to the appellant  the  appellant  admitted  he  was  a
        national of the Ivory Coast and that his true name and identity  is
        Gabriel Kowadjo Boni Dadie, clearly indicating that assertions made
        to the contrary set out by  the  Judge  were  lies,  including  the
        letter from previous representatives Duncan Lewis dated 27  October
        2008 challenging deportation on the basis of the appellants claimed
        Belgium nationality.
    13. The Judge refused the adjournment request for the reasons  set  out
        at [42 - 45] and no  arguable  legal  error  is  made  out  in  the
        decision to proceed.
    14. The Judge sets out findings of fact from [7] in  relation  to  both
        the order for the  appellant's  deportation  and  the  question  of
        whether the appellant has entered into a  marriage  of  convenience
        with the EEA national.
    15. In relation to  the  order  for  the  appellant's  deportation  the
        Judge's findings can be summarised as follows:


             a. The Judge initially approached the appeal on the basis  the
                appellant is the family member as a  spouse  of  a  Belgium
                national. Whilst  accepting  the  appellant  was  issued  a
                Residence Card this was in the  name  of  N'Gata  when  the
                respondent did not know the appellant's true identity which
                begs the question as to whether or not  the  appellant  had
                entered  into  a  marriage  of  convenience  which  is  the
                respondent's case [67].
             b. The Judge found  the  appellant  to  be  "a  skilful  liar,
                familiar with the use of forged documents, and well used to
                using  and  maintaining  different  identities  -  even  as
                recently as his conviction in Woolwich Crown Court in April
                2016  in  the  name  of  Justin  N'Gata   whilst   he   was
                simultaneously contesting deportation  proceedings  in  his
                now claimed identity  of  Gabriel  Kowadjo  Boni  Dadie,  a
                national of  Ivory  Coast.  I  find  as  submitted  by  the
                Presenting Officer (to whom I am indebted for very  skilful
                cross examination in a factually complicated appeal),  that
                the appellant has persistently  and  consistently  deceived
                both the Home Office and the UK criminal courts  about  his
                true identity" [72].
             c. The Judge gave  weight  to  a  questionnaire  in  which  no
                reference was made to the appellant having any children  in
                the UK. The  questionnaire  was  submitted  in  April  2013
                whereas  at  the  hearing,  by  contrast,   the   appellant
                maintained he is the father of two children born and living
                in the UK [73].
             d. The Judge finds the appellant has lived unlawfully  in  the
                UK throughout his  stay  from  either  1998  or  2000.  The
                appellant's stay prior to his marriage to Ms Kouassi on  19
                June 2012 was at all times unlawful [74].
             e. The appellant has not established any lawful residence  and
                hence has no permanent right  of  residence  since  if  his
                marriage did establish any right  to  reside  he  has  only
                lived for some  3�  years  only  since  his  marriage.  The
                respondent  rightly  considered  whether  deportation   was
                justified on grounds of public policy [75].
             f. The Judge considered the sentencing remarks [76-78] and the
                presentence report [79] before finding  the  appellant  was
                involved in a conspiracy to steal a  cheque  book  for  the
                purpose  of  organised  crime  and  gave  weight   to   the
                sentencing  remarks  that  this  "was  a  very  significant
                financial crime" [80].
             g. The Judge did not accept  the  appellant  lacked  knowledge
                about the false French driving licence [81].
             h. Whilst accepting the appellant pleaded guilty to possession
                of articles for use in fraud, the Judge gave weight to  the
                fact those criminal proceedings were conducted in what  the
                appellant now states is the false identity of Justin N'Gata
                and that the appellant never revealed his true identity  to
                either the  Woolwich  Crown  Court  nor  to  his  Probation
                Officer and continued to maintain the false  identity  with
                the probation services until at least November 2016 [82].
             i. The Judge did not accept what Ms Kouassi said in her letter
                that the appellant had learned from his mistakes. The truth
                is  that  the  appellant  continued  to  maintain  a  false
                identity virtually up until the hearing  before  the  Judge
                [83].
             j. The appellant's offences of fraud  are  all  dishonest  and
                "show him to be well-versed in the use of  and  maintaining
                false  identities,  all  of  which  go  to  the  heart   of
                immigration control and undermine the system of immigration
                control". The Judge gave weight to  the  fact  the  Bromley
                Magistrates Court considered the offence to be  so  serious
                that they  directed  the  appellant  be  sentenced  at  the
                Woolwich Crown Court [84].
             k. The Judge gave weight to the fact  the  presentence  report
                states that the appellant had been granted a residence card
                as he had not disclosed his previous convictions  and  UKBA
                were not aware of his true identity, and that in  May  2015
                the Home Office made a decision  to  pursue  a  deportation
                order based on  the  appellant's  previous  conviction  and
                length of sentence and that since he had absconded and been
                wanted ever since [85].
             l. At [87 -90] the Judge finds:


                87.    I find that the respondent has established that  the
                      appellant's  deportation  is  justified  on   serious
                      grounds of public policy and that he does represent a
                      genuine present and sufficiently  serious  threat  to
                      the public to justify his  deportation.  In  reaching
                      this decision  I  have  considered  the  guidance  in
                      Regulation 21(5) and find for  the  reasons  set  out
                      below that the decision to  deport  is  proportionate
                      and  that  his  offences  of  dishonesty  and   fraud
                      represent a genuine present and sufficiently  serious
                      threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of
                      society when applying the  reasoning  in  Tsakouridis
                      [2011] 2 CMLR 11.


                88.    In reaching this decision,  I  have  considered  not
                      just the appellant's  criminal  convictions  which  I
                      accept as he stated are  several  years  apart  being
                      2007/8 and 2016 and that there are only two of  them.
                      I find there is a common theme of the use  of  forged
                      documents and both convictions are  in  what  he  now
                      claims to be a false identity of Justin N'Gata but  I
                      have also taken into account his conduct  was  living
                      unlawfully in the UK  for  many  years  and  that  he
                      obtained his residence permit under false pretences.


                89.    I give weight to the fact that he has  received  NHS
                      treatment in 2011 for a heart condition to  which  he
                      was arguably not entitled and particularly  not  when
                      claiming to be a Belgium national which he now states
                      he never has been.


                90.    Given the fact that the appellant was  convicted  at
                      Woolwich  Crown  Court  in   his   alternative   and,
                      according to him, false identity of Justin N'Gata,  I
                      find that the risk of further offending is not as low
                      as the probation officer suggested given that he  has
                      been prepared to maintain two identities up until  at
                      least November 2016.

    16. In relation to the question of whether the appellant entered into a
        Marriage of Convenience, the Judge's findings can be summarised  in
        the following terms:


           a. The Judge was sufficiently troubled by the evidence  of  Miss
              Kouassi to invite her to write a  letter  to  the  Judge  for
              further consideration should she wish to do so, which she did
              [91].
           b. The Judge gave weight to the fact Miss Kouassi came to the UK
              aged 17 to join her father that she had been "grievously used
              by the men in the household of her father and is right to  be
              ashamed of her  past  and  what  she  has  described  as  two
              agonising years" [92].
           c. At [93] the judge finds:


                  93.      I find that the marriage entered into between the
                      appellant and Miss Kouassi on 19 June 2012 is a  sham
                      and a marriage of convenience to assist the appellant
                      to evade deportation proceedings and remain in the UK
                      as the spouse of an EEA national as submitted by  the
                      Presenting Officer.  I find that Miss Kouassi had  to
                      endure the infidelity of the appellant who, according
                      to him, fathered a child [PHD] DOB  21  August  2013,
                      who must have been conceived in about  November  2012
                      and hence the appellant has been unfaithful  to  Miss
                      Kouassi within five months of their marriage.


           d. The Judge disbelieved  the  appellant's  evidence  that  Miss
              Kouassi had given birth to a child on  5  August  2013  by  a
              cousin  about  whom  there  was  no  evidence  and  no  birth
              certificate. The Judge recorded that  Miss  Kouassi  made  no
              reference to any such child in her oral evidence [94].
           e. The Judge noted Miss  Kouassi  was  expected  to  look  after
              another child said to be the product of a liaison between the
              appellant and another  named  individual  shortly  after  her
              arrival, and disbelieved the appellant's oral  evidence  that
              he is the father of that child. The Judge finds the father of
              that child is also the father  of  another  named  child  and
              disbelieved the appellant's oral evidence  that  he  has  DNA
              evidence to establish his paternity of that child and that if
              he had such  evidence  he  would  have  produced  it  to  the
              Tribunal [95].
           f. The Judge gave weight to the  fact  that  children  whom  the
              appellant claims to be the father of  both  live  with  their
              natural mothers and there was no evidence  from  the  alleged
              mother of the child Miss Kouassi is expected to  look  after.
              The only evidence relating to this was a letter from  another
              named individual that the appellant himself conceded  he  had
              written, according to him dictated whilst the alleged  author
              of the letter was speaking [96].
           g. The Judge gave weight to the fact there was no  evidence  the
              appellant  had  ever  financially  supported  either  of  the
              children and there  was  no  evidence  to  establish  he  had
              regular access each weekend as claimed [97].
           h. The Judge considered the best interests of the  children  and
              found there was no family life between the appellant and each
              of the two named children who will remain  living  and  being
              supported by their natural mothers. It was found there is  no
              family life deserving of protection  pursuant  to  article  8
              ECHR with the children [98].
           i. The Judge found the appellant  was  not  truthful  about  the
              application to adjourn maintaining he had already raised �800
              and needed a short adjournment in order to raise  �1000.  The
              Judge refers to a letter from A. Bajwa & Co dated 19  January
              2017 part of which states "we did not appear today as we were
              left without any proper instructions from the  above  despite
              having prepared some of the case on the basis of the client's
              numerous assurances that he will pay our fee for the  appeal.
              The client told us yesterday evening approximately 18:34  hrs
              that he paid into our account and we requested that  he  send
              us a screenshot of the online payment  as  proof  of  payment
              given. Fees, however, have not been paid towards  the  appeal
              preparation and legal representation. We  apologise  for  any
              inconvenience caused, however we were very flexible with  the
              above named due to the seriousness of the matter  before  the
              court" [99].
           j. The Judge found  weight  could  be  given  to  the  fact  the
              appellant although running a self-employed cleaning  business
              obtained working families tax credits because he  only  works
              30 hours a week and found the appellant was manipulating  the
              UK system of state benefits to his own advantage [101].
           k. The Judge found the  appellant  was  never  entitled  to  the
              residence card issued in the name of Justin N'Gata, a Belgium
              national, since he now denies this identity [102].
           l. The Judge noted a change of name deed  entered  into  by  the
              appellant on 5 February 2011 which it is said  the  appellant
              breached as he had not adhered to the terms of the change  of
              name deed on many occasions, which required him to  only  use
              the  name  Gabriel  Kowadjo  Boni  Dadie,  including  in  the
              proceedings at the Woolwich Crown Court in April 2016 [103].
           m. At [105], having considered  case  law  referred  to  in  the
              previous paragraph, the Judge writes:


                  105.     For the reasons set out earlier I find  it  would
                      be  proportionate  to  deport  the   appellant   when
                      balanced  against  the  threat   to   the   appellant
                      represents to the public  and  that  the  appellant's
                      length unlawful  residence  in  the  UK,  his  modest
                      earnings from his  self-employment  and  reliance  on
                      public benefits such as working tax  credit  and  his
                      use of the NHS, and his dishonest conduct in all  his
                      dealings with the criminal courts and with  the  Home
                      Office leads me  to  the  conclusion  that  there  is
                      nothing in the appellant's private life, since I have
                      dismissed any claim based  on  family  life  with  Ms
                      Kouassi, to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in  his
                      deportation.


    17. The appellant sought permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
        which was granted by another judge of the First-tier Tribunal on  5
        June 2017. The operative part of the grant being in  the  following
        terms:


                  2.    It  is  arguable,  as  stated  in  the  grounds   of
                      application, that the Judge erred in fact in  stating
                      that the Respondent's position was that the Appellant
                      had entered into a marriage of  convenience  with  an
                      EEA national (when in fact the Respondent's  position
                      as  stated  in  the  refusal  letter  was  that   the
                      relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  the   EEA
                      national was not genuine and subsisting) and that the
                      Appellant was sentenced, in November 2016, to a  term
                      of imprisonment of  was  16  weeks,  not  16  months,
                      stated by the Judge. It is unclear if  these  factual
                      errors resulted  in  a  material  error  of  law  and
                      permission to appeal is therefore granted.




Error of law


    18. On behalf of the appellant Ms Joshi confirmed the appellant was not
        represented before the First-tier Tribunal as he had not  paid  for
        the solicitors to attend. This fact was recorded by the  Judge  who
        also found that the solicitors had acted with  great  propriety  in
        the appeal [100]. The Judge was entitled to  proceed  to  determine
        the appeal in the absence of the legal representative on the  facts
        of this case.
    19. Ms Joshi had to accept that as a result she was unaware of what had
        happened at the hearing and what had been  said  but  claimed  that
        that is a situation that should not have come about and that if the
        solicitors had attended they could have guided the judge and  dealt
        with the issues that led to the findings in this case.
    20. The fact the solicitors  were  unaware  of  what  happened  at  the
        hearing is as a result of the appellant's  own  actions.  A  person
        does  not  have  a  fundamental  right  to  be  represented  during
        proceedings and many appear before the  Courts  and  Tribunal's  as
        self represented litigants in light of the difficulty in  obtaining
        public funding and costs of private representation. It has not been
        made  out  this  is  a  case  in  which  the  appellant  should  be
        categorised as a vulnerable witness and it is  clear  from  reading
        the decision that the appellant was  able  to  give  his  evidence,
        answer questions put in cross examination, and provide a number  of
        documents in support of his case referred to by the Judge.
    21. Ground 1 of the application for permission to appeal to  the  Upper
        Tribunal asserts the Judge considered  inaccurate  facts  and  made
        irrelevant findings. The claim  the  Judge  did  not  consider  the
        evidence has no arguable merit as a reading  of  the  determination
        clearly shows. It is accepted there is a reference in [86] that the
        Sentencing Judge imposed a prison sentence of 16  months  upon  the
        appellant when in fact the sentence of the Woolwich Crown Court was
        16 weeks but the appellant's  assertion  this  makes  the  decision
        unsafe has no arguable merit. At [33] the Judge sets out in tabular
        form four  occasions  on  which  the  appellant  has  come  to  the
        attention of the authorities as a result of criminal activity,  the
        final event of which on 15 April 2016 was before the Woolwich Crown
        Court when the appellant received a term of 16 weeks'  imprisonment
        and the Court ordered the forfeiture and destruction of  the  false
        French driving licence.
    22. It was submitted on  the  appellant's  behalf  that  the  error  is
        material as a 16-week sentence is less than a  12  month  sentence.
        Whilst that is so, the issue is whether what was submitted  on  the
        respondent's behalf is a typographical error at [89] has been shown
        to have materially affected the Judge's conclusions. This  has  not
        been made out on the basis of the evidence  when  considered  as  a
        whole.
    23. It is also submitted  the  Judge  erred  at  [90]  in  stating  the
        appellant kept his identity hidden up until November  2016  as  his
        most recent conviction in November 2016 was under his  current  and
        not previous name. The finding at [90] recorded that the  appellant
        had been convicted at the Woolwich Crown Court in his  false  name.
        The fact of  the  conviction  and  reason  for  conviction  is  not
        disputed and nor is it challenge that the appellant did not confirm
        his true identity until asked by  the  Judge  at  the  day  of  the
        hearing, having maintained  throughout  that  he  was  exempt  from
        deportation under the UK Borders Act  2007  on  the  basis  of  his
        Belgian nationality. It has not been shown any error in the finding
        by the Judge that the appellant has not been honest in relation  to
        his true  identity,  on  one  occasion,  is  infected  by  arguable
        material legal error.
    24. The appellant asserts the Judge was wrong to make  a  finding  that
        the marriage was one of convenience as this was never an issue open
        to the Judge to adjudicate upon as it is said this is not a  matter
        the respondent raised in the decision subject to the  appeal.  This
        is challenged by Mr Avery on behalf of the Secretary  of  State  on
        the basis the question raised by the  respondent  was  whether  the
        marriage was subsisting. It is argued the question of the  marriage
        of convenience arose from the evidence received at the hearing,  as
        found by the Judge at [93],  when  further  evidence  was  received
        relevant to this issue. No prejudice  is  made  out  as  the  Judge
        invited the appellant's wife to make further written submissions on
        the point,  which  it  is  noted  she  did,  and  which  have  been
        considered within the body of the determination under challenge.  A
        Judge is entitled to raise  matters  which  have  not  been  raised
        previously provided  the  parties  are  given  the  opportunity  to
        respond before a decision is  made  upon  such  issues.  The  Judge
        clearly ensured there was no procedural unfairness by providing the
        opportunity to make additional written  submissions.  Even  if  the
        marriage of convenience issue was not raised by  the  Secretary  of
        State that does not bar the Judge from making a  decision  on  that
        point if required. No arguable legal error is made out.
    25. The grounds assert  the  Judge  failed  to  fully  apply  case  law
        relating to rehabilitation/integration in light of  the  inaccurate
        assessment of relevant facts but it is not made out  that  detailed
        submissions were made to  the  Judge  or  that  evidence  was  made
        available  that  would  warrant  a  finding  being  made   in   the
        appellant's favour on this  point.  The  Judge  clearly  considered
        evidence provided and has given adequate  reasons  for  conclusions
        reached including on the question of whether the appellant could be
        removed from the United Kingdom.
    26. The finding of the Judge that the marriage  between  the  appellant
        and Ms Kouassi is a marriage of convenience means it is not a valid
        marriage as that term is defined under  the  EEA  Regulations.  The
        Judge notes the appellant now admits he is not an EEA national  and
        finds he is not the family member of an EEA national  and  hence  a
        foreign criminal. This is a finding fully open to the Judge on  the
        evidence  considered  and  findings  made.  The  Judge   thereafter
        considered the merits of the appeal  by  reference  to  established
        case law prior to dismissing the appeal.
    27. The  appellant's  representative  sums  up  the  challenge  to  the
        decision in Ground 9 in the following terms:


                  9.    In  conclusion,  it  is  clear  from  the   numerous
                      inconsistencies in fact and irrelevant findings  made
                      in law that the FTT IJ has failed  to  consider  this
                      matter fully and fairly. This is to suggest that  the
                      error in listing the facts accurately has led the FTT
                      IJ not to make  findings  regarding  the  appellant's
                      character which of the facts  was  stated  accurately
                      would lead to another conclusion. Thus,  the  FTT  IJ
                      has failed to grapple the fact rendering the decision
                      materially in error of law.  Similarly,  the  FTT  IJ
                      finding that the marriage is one of convenience  when
                      the issue was not before the court is  indicative  of
                      the FTT IJ's approach and therefore the determination
                      has not been fully and fairly  concluded.  Therefore,
                      the FTT IJ's determination is not based on the  facts
                      of the matter as such there is an error  of  law,  on
                      the  balance  of  probabilities,  and  permission  to
                      appeal should be granted.


    28. As stated, permission was granted and the judge granting permission
        refers to the fact it was unclear whether any factual  errors  made
        resulted in a material error of law. It is the conclusion  of  this
        Tribunal  that  any  errors  that  have  been  identified  are  not
        material. The appellant seeks to argue that  he  should  have  been
        represented  at  the  hearing  and  appears  to   infer   that   as
        representation is now  available  the  matter  should  be  reheard.
        Disagreement with findings made or a desire to  be  represented  do
        not warrant a properly concluded  decision  being  set  aside.  The
        appellant had the opportunity to put his  case  to  the  Judge  who
        ensured a fair hearing for all parties,  and  made  findings  based
        upon the evidence presented.
    29. The Judge was entitled to take the marriage of convenience point in
        light of the evidence received which, when considered as  a  whole,
        arguably shows that the Judge had good reason for making a  finding
        in the manner expressed in the determination. The core question was
        whether the marriage was entered into for the purposes of  enabling
        the appellant to evade deportation proceedings and remain in the UK
        as the spouse of an EEA national as was submitted by the Presenting
        Officer assisting the Judge [93]. The fact the  Presenting  Officer
        made this submission clearly shows that this was an issue that  did
        not arise from the Judge considering the material after the hearing
        but at the hearing itself and  which  must  have  been  raised  and
        brought to the attention of the parties. No arguable legal error is
        made out.
    30. In relation to the  evidence,  the  weight  to  be  given  to  that
        evidence was a matter for the Judge. The appellant  has  failed  to
        make out that in apportioning weight the  Judge  has  acted  in  an
        irrational  or  perverse  manner.  The  appellant  applied  for  an
        adjournment which was refused by the Judge who was therefore  aware
        that the  proceedings  will  continue  with  the  appellant  as  an
        unrepresented  litigant.  The  Judge  also  founds  the   appellant
        deceived his own solicitors and attempt to deceive the Judge  which
        is also very relevant, in light  of  the  history  of  offences  of
        deception, to the caution with which the Judge had to approach  the
        evidence. Mr Avery refers to the finding at [43] recorded that  the
        appellant's witness statement and that of Ms Kouassi drafted by the
        appellant's solicitors, together with a number of  other  documents
        were in the appellant's possession and came to the attention of the
        Judge during the course of the  hearing.  The  relevance  of  these
        documents is not only that they clearly set out the nature  of  the
        appellant's case which  the  Judge  was  then  able  to  take  into
        account, but because the nature of the adjournment application made
        by the appellant was because he claimed  such  documents  were  not
        available and that he needed more time to prepare the same.
    31. The Judge clearly considered the public policy issue and  the  risk
        the appellant posed to the wider public together with  the  content
        of the presentencing reports and other documentation.
    32. A submission made by Ms Joshi  in  reply  was  that  if  the  Judge
        thought the point regarding the marriage was  in  issue  the  Judge
        should have asked the Secretary of State to carry out  a  procedure
        to make checks to assess if the marriage was one of convenience, as
        the appellant was  not  represented  and  was  in  person  and  she
        questioned how the appellant could deal with this issue. When asked
        what checks she was proposing the respondent should be expected  to
        make, Ms Joshi stated the evidence  from  the  appellant  asserting
        that the marriage was genuine and that these were not  matters  for
        the hearing as the procedure was not fair.
    33. Such assertion  has  no  arguable  merit.  Whilst  it  is  for  the
        Secretary of State to discharge the burden  upon  her  to  prove  a
        marriage is a marriage of convenience if that is asserted prior  to
        any hearing as part of the  decision-making  process,  this  matter
        arose at the hearing when it was the Judge who was concerned  about
        the  point  arising  from  the  evidence  being  considered,  which
        included concerns regarding Ms Kouassi having been used  as  a  sex
        slave by the various men living at the address stated at  [91].  As
        such, the burden is not upon the Secretary of State as she does not
        make the allegation. Had further enquiries been necessary, such  as
        a  marriage  interview,  the  Judge   possessed   the   appropriate
        discretionary case management power to adjourn the hearing for this
        to occur. It was not considered such a step was necessary in  light
        of the evidence received and in light of the fact  the  Judge  gave
        the  appellant  the  opportunity  to  adduce  further  evidence  as
        recorded above, which could have been obtained with the  assistance
        of legal representatives if required. These matters are appropriate
        to be determined at a hearing in light of the nature  of  litigious
        proceedings and it has not been shown  any  procedural  impropriety
        has occurred sufficient to amount to  material  error  of  law.  On
        balance, I make a finding of fact that the appellant has failed  to
        make out any arguable material error of  law  in  relation  to  the
        decision of the Judge to dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal  on  the
        stated grounds. The Judges determination shall therefore stand.
