                                  DECISION

Error of Law Decision

 1. By a decision dated 12 September 2014, the Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department (the "Secretary of  State"),  the  Respondent  to  this
    appeal, refused  the  application  of  the  Appellant,  a  national  of
    Australia aged 23 years, for a residence card under the EEA Regulations
    2006. The decision letter stated, in terms, that essential evidence was
    lacking. The decision was formulated in the following way:

         "...  You have failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate
         that your EEA family member is currently a qualified person in  the
         United Kingdom as a worker, as detailed under Regulation 6  of  the
         [EEA Regulations]".

    The EEA national in the equation is  the  Appellant's  mother,  also  a
    national of Australia, to whom a residence card was issued on  23  July
    2013. She lives and works in Northern Ireland.  The  Appellant  resides
    with the family unit constituted by his mother,  step  father  and  two
    step brothers.

 2. As recorded in the decision of the FtT, evidence was  adduced  relating
    to the employment and income of the persons concerned  and  matters  of
    upkeep, maintenance and family finances. The central issue was  whether
    the Appellant had demonstrated that he is a dependent of  the  relevant
    EEA national.  In dismissing the appeal, the Judge highlighted that the
    Appellant is in employment, has secured GCSE and  other  qualifications
    and is a socially adaptable young man capable of living an  independent
    existence.

 3. The grant of permission to appeal recorded that an  error  of  law  had
    arguably occurred because the Judge -

         "...  appears to have decided  the  dependency  issue  against  the
         Appellant  on  the  basis  that  he  was  capable  of  being  self-
         supporting, even though the  evidence  showed  that  his  essential
         needs were met in part with financial support from his  mother  and
         step father ...

         [The  Judge]  may  have  viewed  the  fact  that  the   Appellant's
         dependency was a dependency of choice rather  than  need,  to  mean
         that the necessary dependency was not established."

    The permission Judge, finally, noted  that  this  latter  approach  was
    arguably incompatible with the guidance given by the Upper Tribunal  in
    Lim (EEA - Dependency) [2013] UKUT 00437 (IAC).

 4. As was clearly decided in Lebon  [1987]  ECR  2811  and  Lim  there  is
    nothing unlawful about a  dependency  of  choice,  subject  to  abusive
    conduct  by  the  applicant  concerned.  In  Lebon,  the   ECJ   stated
    unequivocally, with regard to the meaning of  "dependent  relative"  in
    Article 10 of Regulation 1612/68:

         "[22]    Article 10(1)  and  (2)  of  Regulation  1612/68  must  be
         interpreted as meaning that the status of  dependent  member  of  a
         worker's family is the result of a factual  situation.  The  person
         having that status is a member of the family who  is  supported  by
         the worker and there is  no  need  to  determine  the  reasons  for
         recourse to the worker's support or to raise the  question  whether
         the person concerned is able to support himself by taking  up  paid
         employment.

         [23] That interpretation is dictated by the principle according  to
         which the provisions establishing the  free  movement  of  workers,
         which constitute one of the foundations of the Community,  must  be
         construed  broadly  (see,  most  recently,  Case  139/85,   Kempf).
         Moreover, it  corresponds  to  the  wording  of  the  provision  in
         question, whose German language version ('Unterhalt gewï¿½hren')  and
         Greek language version ('?????? ?v????????') are particularly clear
         in that respect.

         [24] ...  the status of dependent member of a worker's  family,  to
         which Article 10(1) and (2) of Regulation 1612/68  refers,  is  the
         result of a factual situation, namely the provision of  support  by
         the worker, without there being any need to determine  the  reasons
         for recourse to the worker's support."

    This is the clearest and most authoritative formulation  of  the  legal
    rules to be applied in a case such as  the  present.   Furthermore,  as
    emphasised in Lebon and Lim, the exercise to  be  carried  out  by  the
    decision maker and, on appeal,  the  Judge  is   fundamentally  one  of
    factual enquiry.

 5. In the decision of the FtT one finds no  reference  to  either  of  the
    reported cases noted above.  Furthermore, in the critical passages, the
    Judge's reasoning and conclusions are simply not  compatible  with  the
    legal rules engaged.  Mr Duffy, on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State,
    realistically and sensibly did not argue to the  contrary.  I  consider
    that the judge became distracted by a line of inquiry which resulted in
    a failure to  first  identify  and  then  apply  the  legal  principles
    engaged. The decision of the FtT is plainly vitiated by material  error
    of law and I set it aside accordingly.



THE FtT'S DECISION REMADE

 6. The exercise of remaking the FtT's decision involves considering all of
    the available evidence, including that recorded in the decision itself,
    the other materials and the further witness statement of the  Appellant
    admitted upon the hearing of this appeal.  The  Appellant  adopted  his
    new witness  statement,  with  appropriate  corrections  and  clarified
    certain issues in cross examination. At this stage of the  hearing,  Mr
    Duffy indicated his acceptance that there were no  sustainable  grounds
    for any continued challenge to the Appellant's case that he has at  all
    material times been, and remains, dependent upon a EEA national.   This
    concession was properly made.

 7. I remake the decision of the FtT by allowing the Appellant's appeal.
