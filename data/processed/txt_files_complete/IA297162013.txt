Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss D Ofei- Kwatia (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr J Parkinson (Home office presenting officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Ethiopia and  her  date  of  birth  is
       14.11.1984.

    2.  This matter comes before me for consideration as to whether or  not
       there was a material error of law in the determination of First Tier
       Tribunal Judge Kelsey (FTJ), heard on 13.2.2014 and dated  25.2.2014
       in which the appeal was dismissed on immigration grounds.


    3.  Grounds of appeal were submitted that the FTJ erred in  determining
       the appeal  after  a  reconsideration  decision  was  taken  by  the
       respondent to withdraw  the  refusal  decision  made  2.7.2013.  The
       reconsideration decision was not before the Tribunal.


    4.  Permission to appeal was granted by First Tier  Judge  Hollingworth
       on 15.4.14.


    5.  In a Rule 24 response to  the  grounds  of  appeal  the  Respondent
       confirmed that the appeal was not opposed and conceded that the  FTJ
       proceeded to hear  an  appeal  where  the  Respondent  had  in  fact
       withdrawn the immigration decision prior to the hearing.


   Discussion and decision


    6.  The facts are not disputed. I find that an error arose as a  result
       of a procedural irregularity.
    7.   At the time of the hearing it was not known by  the  Tribunal  nor
       the Home Office presenting  officer  that  the  respondent  wrote  a
       letter dated 6.2.14  confirming  that  the  refusal  decision  dated
       2.7.2013 was withdrawn and  on  reconsideration  the  appellant  was
       granted leave outside of the rules.  This letter was not before  the
       First  Tier  Tribunal  and  it   appears   that   the   Respondent's
       representative did not know appeared of the  withdrawal decision.  I
       rely on the Rule 24 response in which  the  respondent  acknowledged
       that there had been a breakdown in communication  which had  led  to
       the Tribunal making a procedural error  by  determining  the  appeal
       when in law there was no immigration decision and thus no appeal.
    8.  There was no need for submissions at the hearing before me.  It was
       unfortunate that Miss Ofei- Kawatia had been unaware of the Rule  24
       response  prior  to  the  hearing.   It  was  apparent    from   the
       correspondence file that  there  had  been  a  significant  lack  of
       communication on the part of the Respondent in this matter.


   Decision
   9.  I find a material error of law by way of a procedural irregularity.
     I set aside the determination.  The appeal is allowed.
