                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms R Stickler, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent has been granted permission to appeal the  determination
    of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Maciel  allowing  the  appeal  of  the
    appellant against the ECO's decision made on 18 April  2013  to  refuse
    entry clearance to come to the UK as the spouse of a person present and
    settled in the UK.  The respondent was not satisfied that the appellant
    could meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration
    Rules.

2.   The sponsor at the hearing adopted her  statement  and  confirmed  that
    she had two jobs at the relevant time and pay slips had been  provided.
    She confirmed  she  received  rental  income  for  the  property.   She
    provided a rental agreement which evidenced that she was  earning  �300
    per month from letting the property.

3.   The issues before the judge were  that  the  appellant  had  failed  to
    provide bank statements covering the period January 2012 and June  2012
    and the title deeds for the property that  has  a  tenant.   The  judge
    noted that the bank statements do not evidence the rental  income  that
    was paid in cash because the cash was used to pay bills by the sponsor.
     From June 2012 rental payments were paid  by  BACS  to  the  sponsor's
    account.

4.   The judge found as follows:

         "18. I find that the Sponsor has been in receipt of rental  income.
             This is apparent from  the  tenancy  agreement  and  her  oral
             evidence which, as I have said, I accept.


         19.   I  find  that  the  Respondent  has  refused  to  exercise  a
             discretion in  the  Appellant's  favour.   I  find  that  this
             refusal to be unreasonable in all the circumstances and I find
             that given that there is no challenge that the  rental  income
             has been paid for that period of time,  the  discretion  ought
             properly to have been exercised in favour of the Appellant.


         20.  I find that the Appellant  fulfils  the  requirements  of  the
             Immigration Rules and I allow the appeal."

5.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Ievins granted permission.

         "2.  The application was made by a form signed on 29 January  2013.
             It was refused by a notice of refusal of entry clearance on 18
             April 2013 because  the  respondent  Entry  Clearance  Officer
             considered that the sponsor (the wife in this country) had not
             shown that she earned enough money to satisfy the requirements
             of paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM and that the specified
             documents had not been submitted.

         3.   This is an out of country appeal, so it is for  the  appellant
             to show that he meets  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
             Rules at the date of decision, 18 April 2013.  The Immigration
             Rules require him to produce evidence governing the period  of
             six months before the date of application.

         4.   Judge Maciel heard  oral  evidence  on  20  March  2014.   She
             correctly identified that Section 85(5)  of  the  Nationality,
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 required her to consider  only
             the circumstances obtaining at  the  date  of  decision.   She
             found that, on the evidence before her, the  sponsor  had  two
             jobs and had a rental income and taken  together  those  three
             sources of income did  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
             respondent conceded that there was adequate  evidence  of  the
             two jobs.  It was also  accepted,  according  to  the  judge's
             determination, that the evidence of the rental income for  the
             six month period was adequate.  However, the sponsor  had  not
             been able to provide bank statements to show the rental income
             between January and June 2012 because the  rent  was  paid  in
             cash.  That evidence was accepted.  From June  2012  rent  was
             paid by BACS into the sponsor's account.  The judge  does  not
             say where in the sponsor's bank statements the rental payments
             received are shown but I accept, as her paragraph  12  appears
             to suggest, that such payments can be identified.  Before then
             rent was paid by cash.

         5.   Judge  Maciel  notes  (paragraph  10)  that  the  respondent's
             representative had conceded that if the appellant provided the
             title deeds and bank statements  then  the  appeal  should  be
             allowed.  The judge did received  bank  statements  and  title
             deeds, after the hearing but relating to the period before the
             date of decision,  which  caused  her  to  conclude  that  the
             requirements of the Immigration Rules were satisfied.

         6.   Permission to appeal is now sought by the  respondent  on  the
             basis that the rental income being paid in cash did not fulfil
             the requirements of Appendix FM (FM-SE).   The  relevant  date
             was the date of application, 4 February 2013 and the specified
             period before that date.  The respondent observes that as  the
             sponsor's current income did now exceed the income  threshold,
             there was no reason to prevent the appellant  making  a  fresh
             application based on the sponsor's income at that time.

         7.   The respondent now accepts the documentary evidence  submitted
             by the appellant in respect of his wife's two jobs.   However,
             what she earned from those two jobs was not, at  the  time  of
             the application, enough to show a gross  income  of  at  least
             �18,600 per  annum.   At  the  time  of  the  application  the
             appellant must rely upon his wife's rental income.   Therefore
             it must be considered  what  documentary  evidence  of  rental
             income  Appendix  FM  requires.   Appendix  FM,  paragraph  E-
             ECP.3.2(d) allows "other specified income of the applicant and
             partner to be taken into account in  determining  whether  the
             financial requirement of paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  is  met."   The
             specified  documents  required  to  evidence  property  rental
             income are set out in Appendix FM-SE paragraph 1.   The  title
             deeds must be (and have now been) produced as well  as  twelve
             personal bank statements for the twelve month period prior  to
             the date of application showing the rental income  being  paid
             into an account in the name of the person concerned  or  their
             partner.  These cannot  be  provided.   As  I  understand  the
             evidence, rent only began to be paid into the bank after  June
             2012.  As the date of  decision  is  18  April  2013  and  the
             application  was  made  before  then   twelve   months'   bank
             statements simply cannot be provided.   It  follows  that  the
             appellant simply cannot produce the specified documents,  even
             though the judge accepted that the  rent  was  in  fact  being
             received, in cash.  Harsh though the effect of this  may  seem
             upon the appellant, in his circumstances he cannot satisfy the
             requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  as  at  the  date  of
             decision.  In finding that he did satisfy those  Rules  it  is
             arguable that Judge Maciel fell into material  error  of  law.
             Accordingly permission to appeal is granted.   I  observe,  as
             the respondent concedes in the grounds seeking  permission  to
             appeal, that

                  'if the sponsor's  current  income  does  now  exceed  the
                  income threshold,  there  is  no  reason  to  prevent  the
                  appellant  making  a  fresh  application  based   on   the
                  sponsor's income at this time.'

             There is  no  reason  why  an  anonymity  direction  might  be
             appropriate."


6.   At the hearing Ms Stickler provided a skeleton argument.  She  said  it
    was conceded at the First-tier hearing and not  challenged  before  the
    Upper Tribunal that the sponsor had produced the specified evidence  to
    demonstrate her income from the two jobs namely income from  employment
    with Haydens Bakery of �14,174 and income from employment with Dominoes
    of �2,325.59.

7.   In relation to the rental income Counsel argued that  it  was  accepted
    that the appellant had produced  bank  statements  showing  receipt  of
    rental income between July 2012 and January 2013 (six months  prior  to
    the application).  The ECO contends that the  judge  erred  in  law  in
    taking into account the rental income as the sponsor and appellant  had
    failed to provide twelve months' bank statements  with  each  statement
    showing the rental  income  being  deposited.   However  on  a  careful
    analysis of the judge's determination, it is clear that she  applied  a
    discretion found within Appendix  FM-SE  in  favour  of  the  appellant
    allowing the appeal under Immigration Rules (paragraph [19]).

8.   She argued that paragraph 10(a)(ii) of Appendix FM-SE which states

    Personal bank statements for the twelve month period prior to the  date
    of application showing the rental income was paid into  an  account  in
    the name of the person or the person and their partner jointly - - -


    does not require bank statements to show the rental income  being  paid
    into the account for each and every month supplied.  It merely requires
    "evidence that the rental income  was  paid  into  the  account".   She
    argued that the ECO's position that the rental income must be paid into
    the account for the entire  twelve  month  period  cannot  be  sensibly
    maintained as such conclusion would mean that an appellant  relying  on
    rental income which had been received in cash for the last  ten  years,
    would have to wait an additional twelve months before  any  application
    could be made.  Such an interpretation is not Article 8  compliant  and
    has a disproportionate effect.

9.   Alternatively she argued that if the Upper  Tribunal  is  of  the  view
    that the Rules do require each of the twelve months' bank statements to
    show the rental income being received, there clearly must be discretion
    within the Rules to disapply such requirement and  permit  an  ECO  and
    judge to consider rental income when the bank statements provided  show
    sustained deposits at the time  of  the  application,  in  addition  to
    credible evidence from the  sponsor  as  to  how  the  previous  rental
    payments were made.

10.  Counsel argued that such discretion is found within paragraph  D(e)  of
    Appendix FM-SE which states

         (e)  where the decision maker is satisfied that there  is  a  valid
             reason why a specified document(s) cannot  be  supplied,  e.g.
             because it is not issued in a particular country or  has  been
             permanently lost, he or she may  exercise  discretion  not  to
             apply the  requirement  for  the  document(s)  or  to  request
             alternative or additional information  or  document(s)  to  be
             submitted by the applicant.

11.  Counsel argued that if it is the  case  that  the  specified  evidence,
    requires twelve months' bank statements with each statement  showing  a
    rental deposit, this evidence could not be supplied  and  there  was  a
    valid reason as to why this was the case, namely that the rental income
    was paid in cash for half of the set period.  The  judge  accepted  the
    sponsor's evidence that the rental income had  been  received  for  the
    entire twelve months by  a  combination  of  cash  and  BACS  payments.
    Further, the HOPO  below  did  not  submit  that  the  sponsor  was  an
    incredible witness.  The judge accordingly applied the above discretion
    and given that there was no challenge that the rental income  had  been
    paid for that period of time, she exercised such discretion as she  was
    entitled to under Section 86(3)(b) of the Nationality, Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 in favour of the appellant.  Therefore  the  judge  did
    not make an error of law.

12.  Ms Isherwood submitted that at  question  3.6.1  the  sponsor  did  not
    provide any information about non-employment income.   The  information
    about the rental income was contained in a letter she sent to  the  ECO
    with the application form on 15 January 2013.  There was no explanation
    by the sponsor as to why not all the rental payments  appeared  in  the
    bank statement.

13.  The ECO considered the appellant's statement that his sponsor  received
    �300 a month in rent but was not satisfied  that  even  when  including
    this source of income, it was sufficient to meet the required financial
    threshold.  In light of this the ECO was not satisfied that the sponsor
    was employed as claimed, that her income was as claimed  and  that  the
    appellant was able to meet the  minimum  financial  threshold  for  his
    maintenance in the UK.  The ECO also said  that  the  sponsor  had  not
    submitted the specified documents and therefore had not demonstrated an
    income of �18,600 per annum.

14.  Ms Isherwood submitted that the discretion  identified  by  Counsel  is
    the decision maker which in this instance is the ECO.   The  judge  was
    only reviewing the ECO's decision and has no discretion in this case.

15.  I find that Counsel was wrong in her  understanding  or  interpretation
    of Appendix FM-SE paragraph 10(a)(ii).  I find, as stated by First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Ievins, that the specified  documents  that  had  to  be
    produced were twelve personal bank  statements  for  the  twelve  month
    period prior to the date of application showing the rental income being
    paid into an account in the name  of  the  person  concerned  or  their
    partner.  This evidence could not be produced because the rental income
    only began to be paid into  the  bank  account  after  June  2012.   It
    follows  that  the  appellant  simply  cannot  produce  the   specified
    documents, even though the judge accepted that the  rent  was  in  fact
    being received, in cash.   This is a mandatory  requirement  which  the
    appellant could not meet.  Consequently Judge Maciel fell into material
    error and her decision cannot stand.

16.  The discretion relied on by Counsel is a discretion to be exercised  by
    the "decision maker". In  this  instance  it  is  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer.  The appellant did not provide an explanation to the ECO as to
    why he could not submit the specified document.  The ECO's decision was
    in accordance with the law and the Immigration Rules as  he  not  being
    aware of any explanation  for  the  failure  to  submit  the  specified
    documents

17.  Counsel relied on section 86(3) of the Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
    which states

         (3)  the [Tribunal] must allow the appeal insofar [it] thinks  that
             -


             (a)  a decision against which the  appeal  is  brought  or  is
                  treated as being brought was not in  accordance  with  the
                  law (including Immigration Rules), or


             (b)  a discretion exercised in making a decision against which
                  the appeal is brought  or  is  treated  as  being  brought
                  should have been exercised differently.

18.   For the reasons given at paragraph  16  above,  I  cannot  exercise  a
    discretion in place of the ECO under  Section  86(3)  as  suggested  by
    Counsel.

19.  In light of the appellant's failure to submit the  specified  documents
    showing  that  he  could  meet  the  financial  requirements   of   the
    Immigration Rules at the date of the respondent's decision, I find that
    his appeal must be dismissed.
