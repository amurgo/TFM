For the Respondent:     Ms Revill, Immigration Law Specialist Association


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal who allowed the appeal on Article 8  grounds
    of Sorayya Bahmanyar against a decision of the entry clearance  officer
    refusing her entry clearance as the spouse of Ibriham Peik.  The First-
    tier  Tribunal  heard  the  appeal  on  4  November  2013  and   in   a
    determination promulgated on 11 November 2013, Judge Doran  found  that
    the appellant  before  her   did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules as set out in Appendix FM when read with Appendix FM-
    SE but allowed the appeal under Article 8 for the reasons that  he  set
    out in his determination.

2.   Those reasons were in essence that the couple would meet the  requisite
    financial requirements of the Rule because there  was  a  gross  annual
    salary  of  ï¿½21,840.   That  was  a  specific  finding   evidenced   by
    documentary evidence before Judge Doran.

3.   The Secretary of State was given permission to appeal the  decision  on
    the grounds, rather curiously, that MM [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin)  had
    been improperly used to supplant the  Rules  so  as  to  find  the  for
    appellant under Article 8 but also commented that it was arguable  that
    if the appellant could  so  easily  demonstrate  the  requisite  income
    required then no disproportionality arose in  requiring  her  to  apply
    again with the prescribed evidence.

4.   Although MM is mentioned in the judgment of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Doran, that in fact does not appear  to  be  the  basis  on  which  the
    decision was reached.  It was on the basis that the financial  criteria
    were met in terms of amount.  The difficulty was that the criteria were
    not met in terms of the evidential basis  for  those  criteria  on  the
    basis of the Rules the judge considered to be in force at the  date  of
    decision.

5.   Mr Walker for the Secretary of State has  very  helpfully  provided  us
    with copies of the relevant requirements of the Rules in force at  that
    time and, as is well known, these Rules have changed  with  regularity.
    It is quite complex  to  know  which  Rules  apply  at  which  date  of
    application and which at the date of decision.  It is  clear  from  the
    copy Rules provided by Mr Walker that under the Rules in force  at  the
    date of the decision  the  subject  of  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, there was a discretion for the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
    consider evidence before him and to take  all  of  that  evidence  into
    account in deciding whether or not to allow the appeal.   Although  the
    Rules state that the Entry Clearance Officer should normally refuse  an
    application which does  not  provide  the  evidence  specified  in  the
    Appendix, there is a discretion that where evidence is produced and  it
    is reasonable then the Entry Clearance Officer can exercise  discretion
    and allow the appeal.

6.   Mr Walker has very properly confirmed  that  had  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer applied the Rules in force at the date of decision,  given  the
    documentary evidence that was available to him, this appeal would  have
    succeeded under the  Immigration  Rules.  The  complication  with  this
    appeal is that the appeal was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    under the Rules and allowed under  Article  8.   There  was  no  "cross
    appeal" by Ms Bahmanyar. Mr Walker  has  very  carefully  and  properly
    sought, with our agreement, to amend his grounds seeking permission  to
    appeal to identify that had the Immigration Rules been properly applied
    by the judge (and the Entry Clearance Officer) then  the  appeal  would
    have been allowed.   He  is  not  able  to  withdraw  his  appeal,  but
    consented to  an  amendment  and  refinement  of  his  grounds  seeking
    permission to appeal such that the correct decision was that the appeal
    by Ms Bahmanyar against the refusal to grant  her  entry  clearance  to
    come to the UK should have been allowed  under  the  Rules.  Therefore,
    although it was allowed under Article  8,  the  final  outcome  of  the
    appeal was correct, namely that entry clearance should  be  granted  by
    the Entry Clearance Officer to enable Ms Bahmanyar to join her  husband
    in the UK because she and he meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

7.   We will allow the appeal of the Secretary of State on  the  basis  that
    there was an error of law in allowing the appeal on Article  8  grounds
    but with reference to the amended  grounds the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal is set aside and the appeal by Ms Bahmanyar,  is  allowed
    under the Immigration Rules.
