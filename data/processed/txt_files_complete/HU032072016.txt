                            DECISION AND REASONS



Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Farelly, promulgated on 11 April 2016. Permission to appeal was granted
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson on 12 September 2016.

Anonymity

   2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason for  one
      now

Background

 3. On 16 February 2012, the appellant arrived in the United  Kingdom  with
    leave to enter as a spouse, valid until 17 April 2014. She was  granted
    leave to remain in the same capacity until 19 May 2016.  Prior  to  her
    leave expiring the appellant sought indefinite leave  to  remain  as  a
    spouse.

 4. The Secretary of  State  considered  the  application  under  paragraph
    287(a)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  but  concluded  that   there   was
    insufficient  evidence  provided  to  show  that  she  could  meet  the
    requirements of 287(a)(i), (ii), (iii),(v) and (vii) with reference  to
    paragraph  322(9)  of  the  Rules.  The  appellant's  claim  was   also
    considered under the Rules in place  from  9  July  2012,  however  the
    Secretary of State did not accept that the appellant had  a  subsisting
    relationship with a partner or children in the United Kingdom; she  did
    not meet S-LTR1.7;  she  did  not  meet  any  of  the  requirements  in
    paragraph  276ADE  (1)  and  there  were  said  to  be  no  exceptional
    circumstances. The appellant was afforded a right of appeal because she
    had made a human rights claim, emphasising  that  the  only  ground  of
    appeal was that the decision was unlawful under section 6 of the  Human
    Rights Act 1998.

 5. The appellant lodged an appeal, which was accompanied by a  significant
    quantity of evidence and an indication was given that further  evidence
    would be forthcoming. The grounds explained that the appellant had been
    living with her husband in rented council accommodation; that their two
    children attended the local school; that they did not  claim  benefits;
    had not broken any immigration rules and that she had the right to live
    as a family unit with her husband and educate her British  children  in
    the United Kingdom.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the  appellant  did  not
    appear and nor was she represented. Indeed, she had requested that  her
    appeal  be  considered  on  the  papers.  Despite  accepting  that  the
    appellant's marriage was genuine and subsisting and that she lived with
    her British husband and children  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal under the Rules; concluding that 287(a)(v) was not
    met and 322(9) applied.  With regard to the new Rules, it was said that
    the appellant met none of the requirements of  either  the  partner  or
    parent route or indeed 276ADE(1). In relation to the Article 8  appeal,
    outside the Rules, the judge agreed with the respondent that there were
    no exceptional circumstances warranting a grant of  leave  outside  the
    Rules.

The grounds of appeal

 7. The grounds of appeal in support of this application  argued  that  the
    judge applied the wrong  rule  or  raised  the  standard  of  proof  in
    relation to paragraph 287(v) on the basis that the  appellant  had  not
    provided a P60  for  her  husband,  a  requirement  which  appeared  in
    Appendix FM-SE. It was argued that the judge failed to  make  reference
    to the application form which provided details of income and rent,  the
    wage slips for the husband and evidence that the  rent  was  paid.  The
    judge failed to provide adequate reasons as to why  this  evidence  did
    not demonstrate adequate maintenance.   The  judge's  consideration  of
    paragraph 322(9) was said to be inadequate given that the appellant was
    said to have provided the  information  requested  by  the  respondent.
    Alternatively, it  was  argued  that  the  judge  failed  to  make  any
    reference to section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship &  Immigration  Act
    2009 or the best interests of the children.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis  that  the  judge  should
    have considered Article 8 outside the Rules, taking  into  account  the
    best interests of the children particularly  bearing  in  mind  section
    117B(6) of the 2002 Act. Permission was not refused  on  the  remaining
    grounds.

 9. The respondent did not file a Rule 24 response with the Tribunal.

The hearing

10. Ms Allen relied on the grounds. She referred to [23]  of  the  decision
    which was relevant to the issue of maintenance.  There  the  judge  had
    noted deposits from  the  AWG  Group  in  the  bank  statements.  These
    deposits were the partner's wages.  Ms  Allen  made  reference  to  the
    respondent's bundle of evidence  which  enclosed  wge  slips  from  the
    partner which corresponded with the  sums  going  into  the  Nationwide
    account. The specific sums had been set out in  the  application  form.
    At this point, I alerted  the  representatives  to  the  absence  of  a
    respondent's bundle on the Tribunal case file; an absence noted by  the
    judge granting permission.  At this juncture, Mr Armstrong submitted  a
    spare copy of the respondent's bundle. Ms Allen drew  my  attention  to
    what the judge stated at [9] about  having  considered  a  respondent's
    bundle containing only the refusal and reasons. She argued that it  was
    an error of law for the  judge  to  proceed  without  the  respondent's
    evidence and that he had further failed to take into  account  relevant
    documentation. She submitted that had the  application  form  and  wage
    slips been considered, the judge could not have found  as  she  did  at
    [23], that she could not tell what the regular payments  from  the  AWG
    Group Limited were for.

11.  Ms  Allen  submitted  that  the  judge's  error  in  relation  to  the
    maintenance issue led to her conclude at [28] that the appellant  still
    fell to be refused under paragraph 322(9). Ms Allen went on to refer to
    a letter from the Right Honourable Andrew Selous,  MP  which  addressed
    the issue of the attempts said to be made by the respondent to  request
    further documentation from the appellant. This letter was  not  in  the
    file, however a further letter post-dating  the  judge's  decision  was
    received on 17 May 2016.

12. Ms Allen informed me that the appellant's case was  that  she  did  not
    receive the letter and only became aware of a voicemail  message  being
    left after reading the refusal letter.  Ms  Allen  submitted  that  the
    appellant  met  the  evidential  requirements  for  maintenance   under
    paragraph 287 of the Rules.

13. Mr Armstrong argued that the judge's conclusions were open to  her  and
    that there was  inadequate  documentary  evidence  of  maintenance.  No
    response was received from the appellant to the Home Office  letter  or
    telephone call and her voicemail was not checked  until  after  refusal
    letter was issued, a delay of 10 or 11 days. With regard to EX.1,  this
    was parasitic on the Rules,  there  were  no  compelling  factors,  the
    children could remain with their  father  or  the  whole  family  could
    accompany the appellant to Thailand while she made a proper application
    through the proper channels. He accepted that the decision did not make
    it clear what documents were before the judge.

14. In reply, Ms Allen reiterated that the respondent's bundle was  not  on
    the court file. That  bundle  contained  relevant  evidence.  The  Home
    Office letter requested a tenancy agreement. The appellant had provided
    this address when seeking entry clearance and further leave to  remain.
    The letter did not ask  for  documents  concerning  finance,  only  the
    address. There was no suggestion on the application form  that  a  form
    P60 was a document which might be required and it did not feature among
    the examples given of the type of documents the respondent  might  wish
    to see at  section  12  of  the  said  form.  The  appellant  submitted
    sufficient evidence of maintenance including wage slips for her own two
    jobs, wage slips for her partner as well as bank  statements  regarding
    all sources of income. The judge would not  have  upheld  the  decision
    under paragraph 322(9) of the Rules had she seen the wage slips in  the
    respondent's bundle. The finding at [25] was not open to judge  on  the
    evidence as adequate evidence had been provided  with  the  application
    form, additional evidence with the notice of appeal and under  the  old
    Rules it was sufficient. The appellant had entered the  United  Kingdom
    through the proper channels and  had  been  granted  further  leave  to
    remain as a spouse. There were two children of the marriage. It was not
    proportionate for the decision under paragraph 322(9) to be upheld.

Decision on error of law

15. I found that the judge made an error of law in proceeding  to  consider
    the appeal in the absence of the  respondent's  bundle  and  that  this
    error had a material impact on the outcome of the appeal.

16. The said bundle consisted of the application  form,  letters  and  wage
    slips from  the  appellant's  employer,  wage  slips  relating  to  her
    partner, the Home Office letter  dated  30  September  2015  requesting
    evidence as well as the notice of decision and reasons for refusal. The
    respondent's bundle which is  referred  to  by  the  judge  at  [9]  is
    described as "a short bundle consisting of the refusal and reasons." It
    is  abundantly  clear  that  the  judge  did  not  have  sight  of  the
    respondent's bundle, which was, in any event absent from the case  file
    when Judge Nicholson granted permission as well  as  when  this  matter
    came before me.

17. The application form in the respondent's bundle listed the 4 sources of
    the family income, including the partner's employment which brought  in
    �1,350 per month. Those sums were reflected in  the  wage  slips  which
    accompanied the form. The respondent's concern was that the  employer's
    name was not readily apparent on the face  of  those  wage  slips.  The
    appellant addressed this matter by providing  further  bank  statements
    which showed the name of the employer as well as the fact that the sums
    corresponded to those shown on the wage slips.

18. The judge, not having had sight of the application form and  supporting
    evidence, found  that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements because while she could identify regular payments from the
    AWG Group Limited, she could not tell what they were  for.  I  consider
    that had the judge taken into account all the evidence, the  source  of
    the AWG payments would have been obvious.

19. The judge's error in relation to maintenance infected her  decision  in
    relation to paragraph 322(9) of the Rules, in that she  says  at  [28],
    "Looking at the matter afresh  I  have  not  changed  the  decision  in
    respect of maintenance. This is an essential part of  the  requirements
    for settlement and the appellant did not and  still  has  not  met  the
    evidential proofs. Consequently, she  continues  to  fall  for  refusal
    under paragraph 322(8) (sic)." A further point worth  making  was  that
    the additional evidence required by the respondent in the letter of  30
    September 2015 did not refer  to  maintenance  but  accommodation.  The
    letter states that the respondent  requires  "documentary  evidence  of
    your recent housing/tenancy agreement for  2015,  this  must  show  the
    address and how much rent you pay."  The  appellant's  application  for
    further leave was not, however, refused under paragraph 287(iv). In any
    event, the missing evidence was provided with the notice of  appeal  in
    the form of a rent statement which showed the weekly rent, the  address
    of the property as well as the fact that the rent was fully  paid.  The
    judge makes no reference to that document which was  certainly  on  the
    IAC case file at the time of the paper consideration.

20. Owing to the  aforementioned  errors,  I  concluded  that  the  judge's
    decision be set aside in relation to her findings as to the  issues  of
    maintenance, the general ground of refusal and her overall conclusions.
    I then proceeded to remake the decision.

Remaking

21. The appeal proceeded by way of submissions  only.  Ms  Allen  submitted
    that the appellant  and  her  spouse  had  4  sources  of  income.  The
    appellant had two jobs, her spouse had one job and they  also  received
    Tax Credits. All the  wages  were  paid  into  one  of  two  Nationwide
    Building Society accounts. The  partner's  wages  were  stated  on  the
    application form, confirmed in wage slips and shown in  the  Nationwide
    account. The appellant's partner had changed his employment  in  August
    2015. At this point, Ms Allen submitted original wage slips dating from
    September 2015 to date from Mitie. I also had sight of  a  letter  from
    the same firm which had been submitted with the notice of appeal.

22. Ms Allen calculated the appellant's family income  in  comparison  with
    the Income Support levels for 2015-2016 as she did not have the current
    rates at her disposal. Essentially, the total  income  for  the  family
    from all sources was �2,538 per calendar month. Their rent was �505 per
    calendar month which left an available  income  of  �2037.  The  Income
    Support rates for a family of two adults over the age  of  18  and  two
    children, including a family premium came to �1,153.10  per  month  and
    their income was clearly well over this sum.

23. Mr Armstrong relied on the refusal letter. He conceded that he  saw  no
    reason to doubt Ms Allen's  calculations.  He  argued  that  there  was
    insufficient  evidence  in  relation  to   accommodation   before   the
    respondent.

24. Ms Allen briefly replied, stating  that  the  appellant  had  sent  the
    evidence sought by the respondent in relation to accommodation as  soon
    as she heard the voicemail.

25. At the end of  the  hearing  I  indicated  I  was  satisfied  that  the
    requirements of the Rules were met and that I  would  be  allowing  the
    appeal.  My reasons are as follows.

26. The relevant date for considering the facts in this case is the date of
    today's hearing. There was ample evidence before me which enabled me to
    confidently reach the conclusion that the appellant and her spouse were
    and indeed are in a position  to  adequately  maintain  themselves  and
    their children without recourse to public  funds.  As  accepted  by  Mr
    Armstrong during his submissions, the household income  after  allowing
    for  accommodation  is  nearly  double  Income  Support  levels.  I  am
    satisfied that benefit levels would not have markedly increased  during
    the 2016-2017 financial year.

27. There remains the issue of the refusal under paragraph  322(9)  of  the
    Rules. While I have seen the respondent's letter requesting evidence of
    accommodation and rent, the appellant states that she did  not  receive
    it. This is an explanation that she has consistently  given,  including
    to her MP, who says as much in his recent letter. There was no evidence
    before me to indicate that this item was posted  to  the  appellant.  I
    therefore accept that she did not receive it. While the  appellant  did
    receive a voicemail message, I have no hesitation in accepting what was
    said by her MP on her behalf, that she did not know how to  access  her
    messages. In any event, the  omissions  relating  to  the  evidence  of
    accommodation were rectified by the provision  of  the  rent  statement
    with the notice of appeal.  Furthermore,  paragraph  322(9)  refers  to
    "failure  by  an  applicant  to  produce  within  a   reasonable   time
    information, documents or other evidence required by the  Secretary  of
    State to establish his claim to  remain  under  these  Rules."  In  the
    refusal letter the  respondent  simply  says  that  the  appellant  was
    telephoned on 13 January 2016 and the appellant was left a  message  to
    contact them to discuss her application. There is  no  reference  to  a
    timescale for a response and in any event the application was refused 9
    days later. The appellant provided  the  missing  evidence  immediately
    upon receiving the refusal letter. I find that it cannot be  said  that
    she failed to provide the missing information within a reasonable  time
    of the omission coming to her attention.

28. This is an appeal on human rights grounds only.  I  therefore  consider
    the appellant's claim outside the Rules but through the  prism  of  the
    Rules. As indicated above I find that she met the requirements  of  the
    Rules. I further accept, as found  by  the  previous  judge,  that  the
    appellant enjoys a  private  and  family  life  with  her  partner  and
    children and that her proposed removal  to  Thailand  would  amount  to
    interference with her Article 8 rights. While there  is  no  suggestion
    that the respondent is not entitled to make such decisions and that the
    decision was in pursuance of a legitimate aim, namely  the  maintenance
    of a system of immigration control, I conclude  that  the  respondent's
    decision is a disproportionate response in the present  case  owing  to
    the fact that the requirements of paragraph 287 of the Rules were  met.
    Furthermore, according to section 117B(6) the public interest does  not
    require the removal of a  person  who  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with  a  qualifying  child  and  where  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the  United  Kingdom.  In  this
    case, there are no concerns regarding the appellant's conduct. She made
    the appropriate application for entry clearance and  further  leave  to
    remain as a partner and has resided in the United Kingdom lawfully with
    her family since February  2012.  While  both  children  were  born  in
    Thailand, they are British citizens now aged  6  and  8.  They  are  of
    school age. I conclude that it would not be reasonable to  expect  them
    to leave the United Kingdom in these  circumstances,  considering  that
    the appellant meets the requirements of the Rules for partners.

Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision to be re-made.

I substitute a decision allowing the appeal on the basis that the  Secretary
of State's decision was not in accordance  with  the  law,  in  that  it  is
unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act.



Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
for the following reason. Further  evidence  which  was  provided  with  the
notice of appeal may have led to leave to remain being granted had  it  been
provided with the application.
