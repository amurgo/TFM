                      Officer




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Belarus born on 27 November 1950. She has
    been  given  permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of  First-Tier
    Tribunal Judge Ruth ("the FTTJ") who dismissed her appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision  of  22  July  2013  to  revoke  her  multi-entry
    visitor's visa and to refuse her application for a  visitor's  visa  on
    the basis that she had failed to pay for NHS treatment in the UK.


 2. On 29 July 2013 the appellant applied for two-year entry clearance as a
    family visitor to enable her to visit her daughter and  her  family  in
    the UK. The application was granted under Visa was issued on  15  April
    2014.


 3. The appellant had previously travelled to the UK  and  she  was  issued
    with a family visitor Visa for two years valid from 25 March 2010 until
    25 March 2012. The respondent said that she had travelled to the UK  on
    22 September 2011 three weeks after being diagnosed with breast  cancer
    and having had a mastectomy operation in Belarus. It was  alleged  that
    during her stay in the UK she sought further medical treatment for  her
    cancer and she said that she had seen a doctor privately. However,  the
    respondent had made  checks  and  become  aware  that  she  sought  NHS
    treatment in the UK  and  had  not  paid  the  cost  of  the  treatment
    amounting to �5395. The respondent took the view that at  the  time  of
    her application the appellant had not mentioned that she had sought NHS
    treatment or that she had not paid for this. Had  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer been aware of this the visitor visa would not have been issued.


 4. On the information available to the respondent the appellant's  visitor
    visa was revoked and she was refused a further visitor Visa  under  the
    provisions of paragraph 320(22) of the Immigration Rules which  applied
    where an NHS body has notified the respondent that the  person  seeking
    entry or leave to enter had failed to pay a charge or  charges  with  a
    total value of at least �1000  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  NHS
    regulations on charges to overseas visitors.


 5. The appellant appealed against these decisions. The FTTJ determined the
    appeal on the papers  on  10  March  2014  and  his  determination  was
    promulgated on 17 March 2014. The FTTJ found that the appellant clearly
    received medical treatment from the NHS costing more than �5000  whilst
    she was here as a visitor. This had not been paid and as a  result  the
    respondent was entitled to refuse the  application.  He  dismissed  the
    appeal both under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8  human  rights
    grounds.


 6. The appellant applied for but was refused permission to appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal by a judge  in  the  First-Tier  Tribunal.  However  the
    application was renewed and granted by a judge in the  Upper  Tribunal.
    There is a Rule 24 response from the respondent.


 7. The appellant's daughter and sponsor, Mrs Mumford, appeared before  me.
    Mr Avery submitted the National Health  Service  (Charges  to  Overseas
    Visitors) Regulations 2011 and the National Health Service (Charges  to
    Overseas Visitors) Amendment Regulations 2012. Mrs Mumford pointed  out
    that she had already submitted and the FTTJ had  the  NHS  Guidance  on
    Implementing the Overseas Visitors Hospital Charging Regulations issued
    by the Department Of Health together with an extract from  the  website
    setting  out  the  Overseas  Visitors  Accessing  NHS  Primary  Medical
    Services - Guidance for GPs, GPC General Practitioners  Committee,  and
    BMA - February 2011.


 8. When a question arose as to why  the  NHS  invoice  relied  on  by  the
    respondent was only a single page when it appeared that there should be
    more than one, Mrs Mumford provided copies  of  both  pages.  She  also
    submitted the letter of complaint which  she  had  sent  to  Broomfield
    Hospital on 22 July 2014 in response to their letter of 16 July 2014.


 9. With hindsight it is perhaps unfortunate that the appellant  asked  the
    First-Tier Tribunal to determine her appeal on the papers.  The  issues
    in this appeal are far from straightforward and  the  FTTJ  would  have
    benefited from oral evidence and explanation for Mrs  Mumford.  At  the
    hearing before me Mrs Mumford presented her mother's case  clearly  and
    succinctly.


10. Mr Avery submitted that if the appellant thought that  she  should  not
    have been charged then she could  take  the  matter  up  with  the  NHS
    hospital. The appellant had come to this country  shortly  after  major
    surgery and should have checked the position in  relation  to  charging
    before accepting treatment from the NHS. Article 8 human rights grounds
    were not engaged. He submitted that there was no error of law and asked
    me to uphold the decision.


11. I find that this is too simplistic an approach. Firstly, the  appellant
    claimed that the appropriate NHS regulations were such that she  should
    not have been charged in the first place.  Secondly,  she  had  in  any
    event complained and her complaint had not been properly addressed.


12. I find that the FTTJ erred in law. It was not open to him to reach  the
    conclusion in paragraph 12 that the appellant ought to have known  that
    she was not entitled to use the NHS  without  paying  for  the  service
    without at least considering and  assessing  the  documentary  evidence
    before him. This showed that the appellant had first  obtained  private
    medical treatment in the UK and that the invoice for  the  NHS  medical
    treatment had not been  issued  until  long  after  the  treatment  was
    received. He should also have addressed the statement from Mrs  Mumford
    disputing that the NHS was entitled to charge for the treatment  backed
    up by relevant documentary  evidence  as  to  the  provisions  of  what
    appeared to be the appropriate regulations.  Whilst  I  appreciate  the
    pressures on First-Tier Tribunal  judges  determining  appeals  on  the
    papers, in this appeal there  was  a  substantial  respondent's  bundle
    containing relevant documents which, although they are referred  to  in
    paragraph 10, do not appear to have been properly considered.


13. Having found that the FTTJ erred in law I set aside his decision on the
    basis that it could be remade immediately after hearing  oral  evidence
    from Mrs Mumford and submissions from her and Mr Avery.


14. I heard oral evidence from Mrs Mumford which is set out in my record of
    proceedings. She handed in a further copy of a letter dated 7 June 2012
    from the GP in the UK who had treated the appellant. The appellant  was
    visiting the UK and appeared to be in  good  health  only  three  weeks
    before she returned to Belarus where it was  discovered  that  she  had
    breast cancer. As a result she had a mastectomy operation in a hospital
    in Belarus on 2 September 2011. Mrs Mumford could  not  get  away  from
    work at such short notice but arrived in  Belarus  a  week  later.  The
    appellant was unwell and Mrs Mumford decided that she should come  back
    to the UK so that she could look after her.  Because  of  her  job  Mrs
    Mumford was not able to stay very long in Belarus  to  look  after  her
    mother. After she arrived in the UK the appellant  became  very  unwell
    and Mrs Mumford took her to her GP. The  GP  recommended  that  she  be
    taken to hospital and Mrs Mumford  decided  to  take  her  for  private
    treatment. The GP referred the appellant to  Professor  Davidson  at  a
    Nuffield clinic. She saw him and he referred her to the NHS hospital at
    Broomfield. He said that it would be better if she  had  NHS  treatment
    under his care at Broomfield  Hospital.  The  appellant  saw  Professor
    Davidson at Broomfield Hospital in October 2011. She was sent for a  CT
    scan and ultrasound imaging.


15. Mrs Mumford accompanied the appellant on all her visits to the  GP  and
    the hospital. The appellant does not  speak  good  English.  They  were
    never told by the GP, the hospital or anyone else that payment would be
    required. They were never given any estimate of the cost of  treatment.
    The appellant had chemotherapy treatment  on  18  November  2011  after
    which  she  developed  septicaemia.  She  was  admitted  to  Broomfield
    Hospital as an inpatient for one  week.  She  then  discharged  herself
    after she became upset, largely because she did not understand most  of
    what was  said  to  her  in  English.  She  refused  further  inpatient
    treatment.


16. Separately and after taking legal  advice  the  appellant  applied  for
    settlement in the UK in September 2011. This was refused in June  2012.
    On 22 July 2012 the appellant went back to Belarus where she  has  been
    ever since.


17. The appellant and Mrs Mumford first heard that a charge was going to be
    made by Broomfield Hospital when they received  the  invoice  dated  19
    June 2013. A further letter was sent to them on  22  July  2014  saying
    that the bill had not been paid.


18. Mrs Mumford submitted that part of the appellant's treatment was urgent
    and part not. The question of what charges should or should not be made
    was regulated by the NHS Guidance on Implementing the Overseas Visitors
    Hospital Charging Regulations issued by the Department of  Health.  For
    non-urgent treatment these Regulations meant that she should have  been
    told that she was going to be charged in advance of the  treatment  and
    an estimate of the charges should have been provided (see paragraph 4.3
    of the Guidance). Urgent treatment should have  been  provided  without
    charge (paragraph 3.18 of the Guidance). She  relied  on  the  Overseas
    Visitors Accessing NHS Primary Medical Services - Guidance for GPs, GPC
    General Practitioners Committee and BMA  -  February  2011  which,  she
    argued, showed that there were bilateral health agreements between  the
    UK and a long list of countries which included Belarus. This  gave  her
    GP a discretion to accept patients from  a  country  with  a  bilateral
    health care agreement as a temporary resident without charge.
19. Mrs Mumford submitted that the  NHS  invoice  incorrectly  stated  that
    payment was due immediately  whereas  under  the  Regulations  and  the
    Guidance there was three months to pay. She  argued  that  it  was  not
    possible to challenge the NHS  invoice  until  after  it  was  received
    because the appellant had no reason to know or think that one was going
    to be submitted. Mrs Mumford took this up  with  the  local  NHS  Trust
    Patient Advice and Liaison Department whose letter dated 16  July  2014
    was unhelpful not least because it referred  to  the  Professor  by  an
    incorrect name and the wrong Nuffield Hospital.  She  is  pursuing  the
    complaint. She produced a lengthy letter dated 22 July  2014  addressed
    to the Patient Advice and Liaison Department dealing with this.  As  to
    the appellant's Article 8 human rights grounds, the appellant was still
    in remission, able to fly  and  desperately  needed  her  support.  The
    appellant came to stay with her, her husband, and her two children.


20. Mr Avery reiterated his earlier submission that there was no  error  of
    law and he could not see how any Article  8  grounds  were  engaged.  I
    reserved my determination.


21. I find Mrs Mumford to be a credible witness. I accept her evidence. The
    NHS invoice dated 16 June 2013 for a total of �5395 has not been  paid.
    The invoice states that it covers treatment over a period. The earliest
    date is 9 November 2011 and the last 8 March  2012.  I  find  that  the
    invoice was not sent to the appellant until about  16  June  2013  more
    than 15 months after the final treatment. The invoice states;  "Account
    raised at the request of Department of Health  and  UK  Borders".  This
    supports my finding, based on Mrs Mumford's  evidence,  that  this  NHS
    Trust not only failed to invoice the appellant  until  long  after  the
    treatments covered by the invoice but also failed to  say  anything  to
    her about the possibility of charges being  made  or  to  give  her  an
    estimate of those charges.


22. The  NHS  Guidance  on  Implementing  the  Overseas  Visitors  Hospital
    Charging Regulations issued by the Department  of  Health  provides  in
    paragraph 4.3; "non-urgent treatment should not be provided unless  the
    estimated full charge is received in advance of treatment". If  any  of
    the appellant's treatment was non-urgent  then  she  should  have  been
    given an estimate in advance and the failure to do so  means  that  she
    cannot be charged later, in particular much later. The urgent treatment
    she received should have been provided without charge. I find that,  in
    relation  to  urgent  treatment,  the  appellant   received   "relevant
    services" as defined in  paragraph  3.18  of  the  Guidance.  Excluding
    categories which do not apply to the circumstances of this  case  these
    were treatment(s) for which the need arose during her  visit.  I  reach
    this conclusion because treatment for which the need  arises  during  a
    visit includes treatment needed where,  in  the  opinion  of  a  doctor
    employed by the relevant NHS  body,  treatment  is  needed  quickly  to
    prevent a pre-existing condition increasing in severity.  I  find  that
    the urgent treatment which the appellant received was treatment  needed
    quickly to prevent a pre-existing condition increasing in severity. The
    pre-existing condition was the cancer from which she was suffering  and
    in particular the mastectomy operation in Belarus.


23. I find that there is a bilateral health care agreement between  Belarus
    in the UK. On the  documentary  evidence  before  me  I  conclude  that
    "bilateral health care agreements have more significance  for  hospital
    treatment than for primary medical care" and GPs have a  discretion  to
    accept patients from a country with a bilateral health  care  agreement
    as a temporary resident or include them  on  their  lists  should  they
    choose to do so. GPs can offer to treat an overseas patient  on  a  fee
    paying basis but not for emergency or immediately necessary  treatment.
    Regrettably, I have received  no  assistance  from  the  respondent  in
    relation to  bilateral  health  agreements  or  the  Overseas  Visitors
    Hospital Charging Regulations. On the balance of probabilities  I  find
    that the appellant was entitled to treatment from the GP and  treatment
    covered by the NHS invoice free of charge for the reasons I have given.


24. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and I can  see  no
    good reason to do so.


25. In the light of my conclusion that the  appellant  succeeds  under  the
    Immigration Rules it is not necessary for me to go on to  consider  the
    position on Article 8 human rights grounds.


26. In these circumstances I find that the appellant  has  established,  on
    the balance of probabilities, that  the  respondent  was  not  entitled
    either to cancel her visa or refuse to grant her a new one. Having  set
    aside the decision of the FTTJ I remake  the  decision  and  allow  the
    appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.
