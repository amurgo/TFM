                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Saffer and
    Mr M LTTE James made following a hearing  at  Bradford  on  13th  March
    2013. An anonymity direction has been made in this case.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangaldesh born on 1st May 1982.

 3. He arrived in the UK on 17th June  2007  with  a  visa  to  work  as  a
    religious worker and was granted leave to remain as a  spouse  on  29th
    April 2009 until  29th  April  2011.   His  extension  application  was
    refused on 21st June 2012 because, on 1st April 2011, he was  convicted
    after trial of three indecent assaults on a girl  of  12  on  different
    dates in May 2009.  He was jailed for twelve  months,  given  a  Sexual
    Offences Prevention Order for five years and required to  sign  on  the
    sex offenders' register for ten  years.   After  his  sentence  he  was
    released and assessed by Social Services and allowed to return home  to
    his wife and son.

 4. When the Appellant was in jail his son  lived  with  his  grandparents.
    The evidence was that his parents-in-law  suffered  from  a  number  of
    medical complaints and are no longer able to assist with providing care
    for him.  His brother-in-law, Suhel,  supported  his  wife  whilst  the
    Appellant was in prison but he is now living in Saudi Arabia.  His  own
    parents cannot help because  they  are  elderly,  ill  and  financially
    dependent upon him.  The Appellant's  wife  suffers  from  anxiety  and
    depression as well as eczema and asthma which flair up because  of  the
    stress of the current situation.  Accordingly it was  argued  that  the
    Appellant's presence in the UK was essential to the family's welfare.

 5. The judge did not accept that the Appellant's  wife  could  not  manage
    without him. He rejected the argument  that his child was dependent  on
    him for his Union Right of Residence and that removal would deprive the
    child of the effective exercise of residence in the UK.  Later  in  the
    determination  the  judge  said  that  removal  would  not  have  grave
    consequence for the child because he would go to  Bangladesh  with  his
    parents.  He concluded that it was proportionate for the  Appellant  to
    be removed and he dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

 6. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on a number of grounds.

 7. First, the judge's assessment that the Appellant remained a  high  risk
    of harm to children was contrary to the evidence because  he  had  been
    cleared by social services to be able to live with his wife  and  child
    following release from prison  and  had  not  breached  any  conditions
    imposed.   He  was  and  is  the  subject  of  continuous  professional
    monitoring by a range of expert agencies and could not be described  as
    a persistent offender.

 8. Second, the judge had not given proper reasons for not  accepting  that
    the Appellant's wife's  health  issues  were  such  as  to  render  her
    incapable of coping without him. The conclusion  that  the  Appellant's
    wife and child would be able  to  access  practical  support  from  her
    parents was illogical given the evidence of their ill-health.   He  had
    accepted that the Appellant's brother-in-law was a constituent  of  the
    support network and no longer available.

 9. It was irrational to find that  the  Appellant's  contribution  to  the
    welfare of his child was not as significant as claimed. He was critical
    to the child's welfare needs. The child was only able to undertake  the
    activities identified by the judge because the Appellant  was  able  to
    escort his wife and child to them.

10. Third, and distinctly, the assessment that the child was not  dependent
    upon the Appellant for the exercise of his Union rights  was  perverse.
    The wife and child's practical ability to access their entitlements  as
    citizens of the EU was reliant upon the proximity of the Appellant.  If
    he were deported to Bangladesh, an area completely outside the EU,  the
    only way the wife could  cope  would  be  to  follow  him  there.   For
    practical purposes the deportation would result in his wife  and  child
    being presented with a serious obstacle in the way of their ability  to
    access their rights as citizens of the EU.  If in reality the wife  and
    child would end up in Bangladesh this  would  clearly  interrupt  their
    capacity to enjoy rights as citizens of the EU and would be an unlawful
    expectation.

11. Fourth,  it  was  accepted  that  if  the  Appellant  was  deported  to
    Bangladesh his wife and child would have very limited contact with  him
    and the level would be wholly different to that now enjoyed between the
    Appellant and his child.  In EA (Article 8  -  best  interests  of  the
    child) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 315 the Upper Tribunal said:

         "The correct starting point in considering  the  welfare  and  best
         interests of a young  child  would  be  that  it  is  in  the  best
         interests of a child to live with and be brought up by his  or  her
         parents subject to any very strong indication."

12. There is a clear assumption that residence with both parents  is  in  a
    child's best interests  and  separation  is  contrary  to  them.   That
    assumption was  ignored  by  the  judge  whose  reasoning  demonstrated
    concern not with what circumstances promoted  the  best  interests  but
    what circumstances did not undermine them.  He therefore failed to have
    proper regard to the ambit of considerations  relevant  to  the  proper
    execution of the Section 55 duty.  There was positive evidence  in  the
    form of an independent social worker's report which concluded that  the
    Appellant's deportation undermined  the  child's  best  interests.  His
    opinion was not to be  downgraded  because  of  a  failure  by  her  to
    identify her practical experiences where her social work qualifications
    were not at issue.

13. Finally, the expectation that the Appellant could go back to Bangladesh
    and resume  work  there  without  restriction  appeared  to  reflect  a
    willingness on the part of the judge to enhance the safety of the UK by
    compromising the interests of children in Bangladesh.  He  ignored  the
    fact that by being supervised and monitored in the UK reduced the  risk
    of re-offending.

14. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge Appleyard for  the
    reasons stated in the grounds.

15. On 29th April 2013 the Respondent served a reply opposing  the  appeal.
    It was submitted that the panel had given proper  reasons  for  finding
    that the high risk of danger to young children posed by  the  Appellant
    outweighed the right to respect for family life under Article 8.

Submissions

16. Mr Muquit relied on his detailed grounds.  In particular he highlighted
    the contradiction in the determination between the acknowledgment  that
    there could be no lawful expectation that the British  wife  and  child
    should go to Bangladesh with the judge's  conclusion  at  paragraph  40
    that that is exactly what the Appellant's wife and child would do.

17. He also submitted that the judge had not given adequate reasons for his
    conclusions that the Appellant's wife could manage without him nor  had
    he given  proper  reasons  for  finding  that  the  Appellant  did  not
    contribute to the welfare of his child.  He argued that the  judge  had
    not given proper consideration to the best interests of  the  child  as
    outlined in his grounds.

18. Mr Diwnycz relied on his reply and said that even if the Appellant were
    removed his wife would, as a British citizen, have the full support  of
    the State in assisting her in bringing up the children.

Findings and Conclusions

19. I conclude that there is no error of law in this determination.

20. With respect to ground 1, the judge gave  proper  reasons  for  finding
    that the Appellant remained a  high  risk  to  children.   Firstly,  he
    abused his position of trust when he was alone with his victim, as  her
    religious teacher.  Secondly,  he  was  persistent  in  his  behaviour.
    Thirdly, he had shown no remorse and fourthly continues to deny that he
    committed the offences.  The fact that he was allowed to return to  his
    family under supervision does not undermine the judge's conclusion that
    the Appellant is a paedophile who  remains  at  high  risk  of  harming
    children.

21. Secondly, whilst there was evidence that the Appellant's parents-in-law
    suffer from a number of different ailments [his  mother-in-law  has  an
    abdominal  hernia  and  his  father-in-law   has   type   2   diabetes,
    hypertension and sciatica],  it  was  plainly  open  to  the  judge  to
    conclude that none of these conditions meant that they were  unable  to
    provide some care for the family and to assist their daughter.   It  is
    clear that when the Appellant was in prison they  provided  substantial
    support and there is no reason why this should not  continue.   It  was
    not irrational for the judge to comment that the Appellant was in  fact
    a hindrance to his wife given that, as they said, her ability  to  gain
    assistance from the community was compromised by his behaviour.

22. The panel accepted that the Appellant's wife required  some  assistance
    but were entitled to conclude that  it  was  available  both  from  the
    family and indeed from the State.

23. The judge specifically addressed the submission that the removal of the
    Appellant would deprive his child of  the  effective  exercise  of  his
    right of residence in the UK or elsewhere in the Union, but it was  not
    perverse for him to find that the child was not dependent upon him  for
    the exercise of his Union rights, having identified a number  of  means
    of alternative support.

24. I  accept  that  the  statement  that  removal  would  not  have  grave
    consequences for the child as  he  would  go  to  Bangladesh  with  his
    parents is loosely worded, and there is an apparent contradiction  with
    the acceptance that it would not be lawful for the Tribunal to  require
    the child to be deprived of the effective  exercise  of  his  residence
    rights here.  However that does not undermine the  determination  as  a
    whole because that was not the basis for the decision with  respect  to
    Article 8, which was also considered on the basis that the  Appellant's
    wife and child would remain in the UK.

25. With respect to the consideration of the best interests  of  the  child
    this was properly considered by  the  judge  at  paragraph  37  of  the
    determination.  In this case there were very serious reasons indeed for
    concluding that even if it were in the child's best interests  to  live
    with both parents, the interests of the Respondent would  outweigh  the
    arguments in favour of this family remaining as a unit in the UK.   The
    fact that the judge did not mention the best interests of the child  in
    relation to his recitation of the key issues to be identified in �ner v
    the Netherlands is immaterial because they were properly considered  in
    the body of the determination.

26. The grounds and submissions amount to a sustained disagreement with the
    decision but do not disclose an error of law.  The judge  was  entitled
    to reach the conclusion that he did for the reasons which he gave.

Decision

27. The decision of the Immigration Judge stands.  The  Appellant's  appeal
    is dismissed.
