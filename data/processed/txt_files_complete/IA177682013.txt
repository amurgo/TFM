Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Nasim, instructed by M-R Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr R Hopkin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 13th November 1976 and
    he appeals against a decision of the respondent dated 30th  April  2013
    refusing the appellant leave to remain on the basis of fourteen  years'
    continuous lawful residence under paragraph 276B(i)(b) as  it  was  not
    accepted that he accrued fourteen years' continuous lawful residence.

 2. The appeal was first heard by First tier Tribunal Judge  Obhi  on  30th
    January 2014 who dismissed his claim under the immigration rules and on
    human rights grounds.  An application for permission to appeal was made
    by the appellant on the basis that the sole issue to be determined  was
    whether the clock stopped upon service  of  an  enforcement  notice  in
    2006.  No record of any such agreement  was  noted  in  the  record  of
    proceedings. A subsequent direction was issued by  Judge  Obhi  to  the
    respondent to produce all the documentary evidence that  was  submitted
    by the appellant with his application for indefinite leave  to  remain.
    The appellant was directed to file any further evidence as he saw  fit.
    Judge Grimes found that for Judge Obhi to dismiss  the  appeal  on  the
    grounds of a lack of evidence was procedurally unfair which went to the
    heart of the decision.  Judge Grimes set aside the determination in its
    entirety.

 3. The matter was listed before Judge Grimes but a transfer order was made
    and the matter listed for a fresh hearing before me.

Respondent's Explanation for Refusal

 4. The reasons for refusal letter stated that the appellant had claimed in
    the Method of Entry Questionnaire  to  have  entered  the  UK  on  25th
    January 1997 with the help of an agent but despite numerous checks  his
    entry could not be traced and he was considered to have entered the  UK
    illegally.

 5. On 6th December 2006 the refusal letter stated he  was  encountered  at
    Heathrow Airport attempting to embark from the UK.  The records  showed
    that he did not  have  leave  and  he  was  issued  with  form  IS.151A
    informing him of his status as an illegal entrant and his liability for
    removal.

 6. The appellant made an application for leave to  remain  on  23rd  March
    2011.

 7. The reasons for refusal letter read as follows.

         "You have stated that you have resided in the UK since 25th January
         1997, a period  of  sixteen  years  and  three  months.   You  have
         provided some evidence in support of your  claim.   However  whilst
         you may have been resident in the United Kingdom since 25th January
         1997, on 6th December 2006 you were issued with a form  IS.151A  as
         an illegal entrant.  On the date of service of this document it  is
         considered that you stopped accruing time which  could  be  counted
         towards long residency.  Any time you have remained in the UK since
         the service of your IS.151A since this date cannot  be  considered.
         Your eligible period consists of 25th January 1997 and 6th December
         2006, a period of nine years and ten months.  This is far short  of
         the minimum period  required  under  paragraph  276B(i)(b)  of  the
         Immigration Rules."

 8. As a result the appellant's application was refused.

 9. The respondent also considered the matter further to  paragraph  276ADE
    of the Immigration Rules and found that he had not resided  in  the  UK
    for  a  period  of  at  least  twenty  years  contrary   to   paragraph
    276ADE(iii).

10. He was considered to be an independent adult  who  had  worked  in  the
    United Kingdom and he could be expected to support himself in  Pakistan
    should he return.  It was accepted that he may have spent some time  in
    the UK but he had nevertheless  spent  the  majority  of  his  life  in
    Pakistan including his formative years and could be expected to readapt
    there.  It was considered that  having  resided  in  Pakistan  for  his
    formative years he would be able to speak the native language and  have
    a knowledge of life there.  Further he would have retained some  family
    ties to Pakistan.  He may well meet some hardships but nevertheless  it
    was reasonable to expect him to do so.

11. The reasons for refusal letter from  the  respondent  also  stated  the
    following.

         "That your precarious immigration status meant that  you  could  be
         returned abroad at any time and, after you were  served  with  form
         IS.151A in 2006 we consider that  you  knew  you  were  liable  for
         removal from this country".

12. He had not provided any evidence to show that he had any family ties to
    persons settled in the UK or other compassionate and  compelling  ties.
    Any such ties could be maintained from abroad through modern  means  of
    communication and visits.

Conclusions

13. I find that the letter of refusal issued by  the  respondent  does  not
    accept that the appellant had been in the UK from 1997  to  2006.   The
    letter uses the word "may have been  resident  in  the  United  Kingdom
    since 25th January 1997".  The  letter  refers  also  to  an  "eligible
    period consisting of 25th January 1997 to 6th December 2006", a  period
    of nine years and ten months.  The respondent appeared  to  proceed  on
    the basis that the eligible period was far short of the minimum  period
    required of fourteen years' continuous residence.  I  can  accept  that
    the letter may have  made  a  typographical  error  when  referring  to
    fourteen years' continuous lawful  residence  as  opposed  to  unlawful
    residence but I do not find that the refusal letter accepts that he had
    been in the UK between 1997 and 2006 or that the appeal  turns  on  the
    service or otherwise of the IS.151A.

14. The burden of proof is on the appellant to show that he has been in the
    UK for the requisite period of fourteen years and for  that  purpose  I
    turn to the evidence.

15. The appellant disputes that he was served with an IS.151A document  and
    in support of its contention that  an  IS.151A  was  served  Mr  Hopkin
    produced the CID notes in relation to one Jalil Mansoor with  the  date
    of birth of 13th November 1976 stating 6th December 2006  "served  with
    an IS.151A".  I can appreciate that the  reference  is  brief  and  the
    evidence in support of this  consists  of  the  CID  notes  only.   The
    appellant in contradiction asserted that he never  attempted  to  leave
    the United Kingdom and  this  does  beg  the  question  as  to  how  he
    facilitated  his  re-entry.   However  the   appellant   accepts   that
    previously  he  entered  the  United  Kingdom  illegally  and   without
    detection.   In his Method of Entry Questionnaire  he  stated  that  he
    came to the UK through  an  agent  on  a  false  passport  and  as  the
    appellant was able to obtain entry by deception into the UK he knew how
    to facilitate entry a second time after his departure in December 2006.
    His denial in the oral evidence must be seen in the context that he was
    previously prepared to enter the UK illegally, with a  false  passport,
    and I place little weight on his  denial  of  receiving  the  IS  151A.
    Someone with the same name and same date of birth as the  appellant  is
    recorded on the Home Office  system  as  having  been  served  with  an
    IS.151A notice at the  Embarkation  Unit  of  Terminal  3  as  part  of
    "Operation Union".

16. If that indeed is correct then the appellant's clock would have stopped
    as at that date.  He cannot show 14 years residence. Mr Hopkin  in  his
    submissions challenged the identity of the appellant in the event  that
    this IS151A was served not on him but on someone else.

17. However, Mr Nasim invited the application of MH  (Respondent's  bundle:
    documents not provided) Pakistan [2010] UKUT 168 (IAC) Rule 13  of  the
    First Tier Tribunal  Rules  requires  an  unpublished  document  to  be
    supplied to the Tribunal if it  is  mentioned  in  the  Notice  of,  or
    Reasons for Refusal or if the Respondent  relies  on  it.  Because  the
    Notice  of,  or  Reasons  for  Refusal  form  the  statement   of   the
    Respondent's case, however, the Tribunal is likely  to  assume  that  a
    document mentioned in either, but not supplied to the Tribunal,  is  no
    longer relied on.

18. MH related to the burden of proving the falsity  of  documents  and  in
    contrast  this  case  referred  to  the  production   of   an   IS151A.
    Nonetheless there was a previous direction from Judge Grimes  that  the
    IS151A was produced and it was not. The respondent cannot rely  on  the
    IS151A mentioned itself but with the production of the CID notes I find
    that the respondent has produced evidence to show  that  the  appellant
    was indeed served with  an  IS151A  to  which  some  weight  should  be
    attached.

19. Even if that is not the case and the IS.151A was served on someone with
    the same name and date of birth of the appellant, the question  is  has
    he shown that he has been in the UK since 1997?

20. What is striking about this case is the  very  limited  nature  of  the
    documentation. There was a direction from Judge Obhi to the  respondent
    to produce the evidence sent with the appellant's original application.
     This was not forthcoming.   Regrettably  the  Home  Office  could  not
    supply the documentation presented with this application but equally it
    would appear that the  solicitors  who  remain  instructed  could  only
    provide limited elements of the documentation and had clearly not  kept
    copies of all of the documentation presented.

21. Nonetheless a record of that information is retained in a letter from M-
    R Solicitors dated 7th March 2011 which accompanied an application form
    SET(O) for long residence  and/or  under  Article  8.   The  supporting
    documentation is recorded by  the  solicitors  in  that  letter  and  a
    schedule is set out on page 5 of that letter of the documentation  that
    was presented.  For ease of reference I will set out that documentation
    that was said to have been presented.

         P60 documents dated 2003-3 and 2004-5.

      g.  2005-2006  supporting  documents  include:  letters  from  Tomcorn

      j. Further supporting documents: NHS Medical Card dated 22nd  November
         2006.   Journal  of   notes   provided   by   applicant's   medical
         practitioner from 13th December 2002 till date.

23. The evidence in relation to the appellant's health records  appears  to
    be the best evidence produced and I turn to the documentation that  was
    presented by the solicitors, the copies of which they had retained, and
    this included a letter from Dr Azim and Partners dated 30th April 2013.
     This however merely confirmed that a person with the appellant's  name
    and date of birth was registered with that practice.   No  photographic
    evidence was produced. Even if I accept this was him, I note  that  the
    letter from the doctor states "this letter was requested by the patient
    to confirm that he/she has been registered with the practice since 14th
    December 2002".  What this letter does not say is that  he  was  indeed
    registered with that practice from 2002.

24. There is a previous letter from the Grovemead Health Centre from  a  Dr
    Shelley, dated 20th December 2010 stating "he  joined  the  surgery  on
    13th December 2002.  He has been living at the above address (according
    to our records) since 11th October 2006.  This letter has been prepared
    at the request of Mr Mansoor".

25. The practice of Dr Azim and Partners and the  Grovemead  Health  Centre
    who wrote the letter on 20th December 2010 appears to be  at  the  same
    premises, although the doctors are entirely  different.   There  is  no
    confirmation that even though the appellant was registered that he  was
    actually living at the address as indeed the letter of 2010  indicated.
    He may have been registered but his attendance was not recorded  for  a
    period of six months and the rules stated that residence would  not  be
    considered to have been broken where an applicant was absent  from  the
    United Kingdom for a period of six months or less at any one time.

26. There is also a Grovemead  Health  Centre  notification  of  change  of
    name/address for the appellant dated 11th October 2006 and what  appear
    to be medical notes which were printed on 4th January  2011  indicating
    various attendances at the practice in December 2002, no attendances in
    2003, attendances in 2004 and 2005 but  no  confirmation  between  12th
    October 2006 and 11th May 2007 of  any  attendances  at  the  practice.
    Indeed it is on 6th December 2006 that the Home Office claims  that  he
    has left the country.

27. I review the documentation  which  was  listed  as  supplied  with  the
    original application.  There is a tenancy agreement for 1997, a  Sareen
    Computer  Learning  Centre's  document  for   20th   March   1998   and
    correspondence from Caf� Also regarding employment dated 18th September
    2002 and Cell Communication dated ,28th March 2002, and May 2002.

28. I can identify documentation that the appellant produced a P60 for  the
    tax year 2004 to April 2005 and  for  April  2003  to  April  2004  and
    tenancy agreements.

29. The documentation said to be sent by the solicitors to the Home  Office
    in support of his residence in the UK between 2003 and 2004 referred to
    a flat share agreement which was, according to the  document  produced,
    due to expire in February 2004.  There was a further tenancy  agreement
    stated from 2009.

30. The appellant produced letters that did refer  to  correspondence  from
    Caf� Also but this terminates his employment on 22nd  July  2005.   The
    Tomcorn Leisure letter referred to on 25th November 2005  advised  that
    his membership was about to expire.

31. There is no confirmation  within  the  documentation  provided  by  the
    appellant's solicitors that he was in the UK between December 2006  and
    July 2007.    None of the documentation  forwarded  by  the  solicitors
    either with the application or in support of his appeal to the Tribunal
    supported the appellant's residence in the UK in 2005  except  for  the
    letter  from  Dr  Shelley  dated  December  2010,  which  recorded  his
    registration with the  practice.  The  accompanying  documentation  was
    stated to be a 'Journal  of  Notes'  from  'Dr.Grovemead  health  which
    consisted of entries of which the dates  were  jumbled  but  one  sheet
    which showed a sequential record of the following entries;

    12/10/06      Administration change address

    6/12/06  Mobile number

    11/05/07 Current smoker

    11/05/07 Smoking cessation advice

32. There was no record of attendances during the period in question and  I
    am not satisfied that the appellant has shown that he  was  in  the  UK
    despite production of an NHS Medical Card  dated  22nd  November  2006.
    The appellant confirmed that he did not visit the doctor for a two year
    period during this time because he did not get  sick.  It  is  for  the
    appellant to prove his case  and  on  a  comprehensive  review  of  the
    documentation provided by the appellant I am not satisfied that he  has
    demonstrated that he has been in the UK continuously for fourteen years
    to the date of his application in April 2013.

33. The appellant claims he did not have a bank account and thus could  not
    produce any evidence of a financial nature but he pulled out  an  IS.96
    with a plastic PIN code attached to it.  The appellant  maintains  that
    he obtained this PIN code  by  accident  when  he  had  to  submit  his
    documentation at government offices.  I find this unbelievable.  In sum
    I find the appellant's evidence not credible.

34. The appellant had no supporting statements, no  supporting  friends  in
    attendance at court to confirm that he had indeed been in  the  UK  for
    the length of period that he claims and bearing in mind he states  that
    he has come to the UK in 1997 and never left I find this not credible.

35. Even if the IS151A is discounted, because it was not  produced  by  the
    respondent  and the 'clock' has not stopped, the CID  notes  are  still
    valid evidence to indicate that the appellant did leave  the  UK  which
    contributes to the finding that he  has  not  been  in  the  UK  for  a
    continuous period of 14 years. There  is  no  record  of  his  re-entry
    merely the evidence identified above to show his presence.

36. I turn to the consideration of his Article 8 claim.  I accept that  the
    appellant may have established a private life in the UK and  indeed  he
    was able to produce documentation including an NHS Medical  Card  dated
    22nd November 2006.  As I state I do not accept that this shows that he
    was resident in the UK.  His application was filed prior  to  9th  July
    2012 and thus falls to be considered, as agreed by Mr Hopkin under  the
    'old rules'.  Despite the transitional arrangements I  have  considered
    the matter in accordance the Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 principles .

37. Owing to the low threshold required in order to engage  a  right  to  a
    private life I find that he has established a private life  here.   The
    removal, however, is in accordance with the law and necessary  for  the
    protection of the rights and freedoms  of  others  through  immigration
    control and the economic wellbeing of the country.  I take into account
    Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and in
    particular that I am to have regard to  the  fact  that  little  weight
    should  be  attached  to  private  life  which  has  been   established
    precariously.  The appellant albeit  that  he  claims  he  is  of  good
    character and behaviour entered the UK illegally and during the periods
    he has been in the  UK,  has  remained  illegally.   Even  if  all  the
    documentation he presented is taken into account it  does  not  support
    his claim to have remained in the UK for the length of time  he  states
    and I am not satisfied that he has remained in the UK as he claimed.

38. Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11

    'In an article 8 case where this  question  is  reached,  the  ultimate
    question for the appellate immigration authority is whether the refusal
    of leave to enter or remain, in circumstances where  the  life  of  the
    family cannot reasonably be expected to be  enjoyed  elsewhere,  taking
    full account of all considerations weighing in favour of  the  refusal,
    prejudices the family life of the applicant in  a  manner  sufficiently
    serious to amount to a breach of the  fundamental  right  protected  by
    article 8. If the answer to this question is affirmative,  the  refusal
    is unlawful and the authority must so decide. It is not necessary  that
    the appellate immigration authority, directing itself along  the  lines
    indicated in this opinion, need ask in addition whether the case  meets
    a test of exceptionality.

39. Indeed I find that he has in fact returned to Pakistan and has been  in
    the UK illegally at all times.  He claims he came to the United Kingdom
    at the age of 22 years and thus he was educated in Pakistan and grew up
    there.  He is an adult single male without  significant  health  issues
    (as disclosed by his medical reports) can speak Urdu and  confirmed  at
    the oral hearing that he has relations in Pakistan, not least his  aunt
    and her children.  The appellant has been able to relocate  in  the  UK
    successfully, is clearly resourceful and could  therefore  re-integrate
    into life in Pakistan.  I have taken into account his witness statement
    but resist his contention that his appeal should be allowed because  he
    is a person of good character with a good social  record.   He  entered
    and lived in the UK illegally.   Although it was claimed  that  all  of
    his real friends are in the United Kingdom to support  him,  none  were
    evident at the hearing. That he is not a threat  to  national  security
    does not bolster his claim.

Order
