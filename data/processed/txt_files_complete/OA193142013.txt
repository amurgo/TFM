For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss O Taiwo (Mount Azure Solicitors)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer but I will  refer  to
    the original appellant, a citizen of Burma, born 10  February  1977  as
    the appellant herein.

2.   The appellant applied  for  an  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC  395).   The  application  was
    refused on 8 October 2014.  The outstanding basis of refusal  following
    a review by the Entry Clearance Manager on  10  October  2014  was  the
    contention that the sponsor, the appellant's wife,  had  not  submitted
    relevant documents in relation to income and savings.

3.   The appellant appealed and  his  appeal  came  before  a  panel  on  27
    October 2014.  The panel heard evidence from the  appellant's  sponsor.
    She had been granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a refugee
    and she married the appellant in April 2012 in  Malaysia.   She  relied
    upon her current income from employment and self-employment  which  she
    argued took her above the threshold of �18,600 per annum.

4.   At the hearing the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  represented  by  Ms
    Dwomoh and the appellant by Mr Htike.  The panel helpfully records  the
    submissions  and  its  conclusions  in  the  following  part   of   the
    determination:

         "Submissions


         8.   Ms Dwomoh relied on the refusal decision.  She submitted that,
             in relation to her  self-employment,  the  appellant  had  not
             provided personal bank statements for the same 12 month-period
             as the tax return that show the income  from  self  employment
             has been paid into an account in the name of the person or  in
             the name of the person and their partner jointly, as  required
             by appendix FM-SE  paragraph  7(f).   She  accepted  that  the
             immigration rules were met in all other respects.


         9.   Mr Htike referred us to the sponsor's evidence that the nature
             of her self employed business which involves  selling  fashion
             at Spittalfield Market, was such that in generated cash  which
             was used to pay rent for the shop and her  flat.   Any  excess
             cash from  the  business  was  paid  into  the  personal  bank
             account.


         My findings


         10.  It is accepted by Ms Dwomoh that the appellant  did  supply  a
             letter from his sponsor's employer confirming her  salary  and
             her length of employment, contrary to the ECO's assertion that
             this was not provided.  It is also accepted that the sponsor's
             income  from  employment  and  self-employment  is  above  the
             threshold of �18,600 and that payslips were provided for  a  6
             month period within 28 days before the application.


         11.  In relation to the evidence of self employed income,  the  ECO
             has stated that 'the documents provided and detailed above  do
             not   however   satisfactorily   meet    the    requirements'.
             Unfortunately it  is  not  explained  in  what  way  that  the
             documents do not satisfactorily  meet  the  requirements.   Ms
             Dwomoh relied on the fact that there is  one  payslip  missing
             dated 16  January  2013  which  is  between  the  sequence  of
             payslips dated 2 January 2013 and 30 January 2013.


         12.  The application was made  on  20  June  2013.   The  appellant
             provided her payslips from 6 June 2012 to 5 June 2013.  I find
             that she has provided wage slips covering a period of 6 months
             prior to the date of application as required by appendix FM-SE
             paragraph 2(c).


         13.  However, even if Mr Dwomoh is correct in assuming that the ECO
             was referring  to  one  missing  payslip,  Paragraph  1  K  of
             Appendix  FM-SE  provides  that  where  documents  have   been
             submitted, but not as specified, and the ECO considers that if
             the specified documents were submitted, it would result  in  a
             grant of leave, they should contact  the  applicant  or  their
             representative  in  writing  to  request  the  document(s)  be
             submitted  within  a  reasonable  timeframe.   Examples  given
             include a document missing from a series.


         14.  I found the sponsor to be a highly  credible  witness  who  is
             genuinely married to the appellant.   She  is  a  refugee  who
             cannot return to Myanmar.  The only fault in  the  application
             was a missing payslip covering a two week  period  in  January
             2013.   It  is  conceded  that  the  application   meets   the
             requirements of the Immigration Rules in all other respects.


         15.  I find that given the number of payslips  provided  which  was
             far in excess of the requirement to provide payslips for  only
             6  months,  the  Immigration  Rules  are  satisfied  and  this
             application should not have been refused."

5.   The panel accordingly allowed the appeal finding that the  decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer was not in accordance with the Rules.

6.   The respondent applied  for  permission  to  appeal  on  the  following
    grounds:

         "1.  The Rules of specified evidence are comprehensively set out in
             Appendix FM and  Appendix  FM-SE  to  the  Immigration  Rules.
             These set out what types of evidence are required, the periods
             they cover and  the  format  that  they  should  be  in.   The
             Tribunal although having regard to this in  the  determination
             seemingly goes on to ignore this where it sets out its finding
             on this issue.


         2.   The appellant had failed  to  provide  payslips  covering  the
             entire 6 month period as required under Appendix  FM-SE,  with
             the  payslip  for  the  week  commencing  16/01/2013  missing.
             Furthermore with regards to the Sponsor's self-employment  the
             appellant had failed to provide bank statements showing income
             from the self-employment has  been  paid  into  the  sponsor's
             account.  At the hearing the  sponsor  accepted  she  did  not
             deposit the money into her bank account and used these  monies
             to pay for rent and buy things as needed for her shop.


         3.   Paragraph 2 of Appendix FM provides that in terms of  salaried
             employment in the UK, all of the following  evidence  must  be
             provided:


             (a)  Wage slips covering


                  (i)   A  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                      application...


             (c)  Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period
                  as the wage slips  at  paragraph  2(a)  showing  that  the
                  salary has been paid into an account in the  name  of  the
                  person or their partner jointly.


         4.   It is respectfully submitted that when a sponsor  is  paid  in
             cash, for the gross income to be taken into  account,  all  of
             the monies received from employment must be paid directly into
             the bank.  This is a mandatory requirement.  Where  only  part
             of the money is deposited then only the net  amount  deposited
             can be counted when calculating the income for the purposes of
             meeting  the  financial  requirement.   It   is   respectfully
             submitted that this was not properly explored  but  [sic]  the
             Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  there  was  a  lack  of
             specified  evidence  submitted  to  substantiate  the  claimed
             income based on the operating  principals  of  Appendix  FM-SE
             these  operating  principles  within  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the
             Immigration Rules ensure that a person's  income  is  properly
             evidenced and will be sustainable and as such in allowing  the
             appeal the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.


         5.   It is respectfully submitted that the Tribunal has  failed  to
             comply with the Immigration Rules and that  its  findings  are
             therefore unsustainable.   It  is  clear  that  the  appellant
             cannot meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE for the 6 month
             period prior to the date of application.  These are  mandatory
             requirements.  Therefore the appellant  cannot  succeed  under
             the Rules.


         6.   For the above reasons it is respectfully  submitted  that  the
             JFTT erred in law and this is a  proper  case  for  the  Upper
             Tribunals consideration.  Permission to  appeal  is  therefore
             respectfully sought."

7.   Permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  17
    December 2014.  Mr Bramble referred to the archived Rules which were in
    force  at  the  time  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer   considered   the
    appellant's application.  Under E-ECP.3.1. the applicant  was  required
    to provide specified evidence and the evidential requirements  set  out
    at page 660 of the archived Rules in respect of self-employment provide
    at paragraph 7(f) that

         "personal bank statements for the same twelve-month period  as  the
         tax return(s) showing that the income from self-employment has been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the  name  of
         the person and their partner jointly."

8.   The appellant in her witness statement had accepted that she  was  paid
    for her self-employment in cash.  The Rule  was  a  necessary  form  of
    cross-reference.  It was necessary to show that the cash had been  paid
    into a bank statement.  The First-tier Tribunal  had  made  a  material
    error of law in overlooking a mandatory requirement.  Article 8 had  no
    bearing on the matter since  the  appellant  could  re-apply  with  the
    appropriate documentation.

9.   Miss Taiwo submitted that the only  point  at  issue  was  the  missing
    payslip and this had been provided.  Moreover the appellant's  salaried
    income had risen since the time of her application and by the time  the
    respondent considered the matter it was over the relevant threshold  at
    �18,795. In response Mr Bramble pointed out that the archived rules  at
    page 653 made it clear  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  only
    required to consider the documents submitted with the application - the
    exceptions to that rule did not apply to circumstances where  a  salary
    increased after the application.

10.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved  my  determination.   I
    can only interfere with the First-tier Tribunal's decision  if  it  was
    materially flawed in law.

11.  It does appear clear from the record of submissions in this  case  that
    the respondent's representative was  relying  on  the  failure  of  the
    appellant to comply with a mandatory part  of  the  Rules  relating  to
    specified evidence.  She had not  provided  the  bank  statements  that
    reflected her income from self-employment.  She acknowledged  that  she
    was paid in cash and this was used to pay rent for  the  shop  and  her
    flat and it was only the excess cash from the business  that  was  paid
    into the personal bank account.

12.  It may be that the panel misunderstood or mistook the  submission  that
    was being made and focused on the issue of the missing payslip which as
    Mr Bramble submits is something of a  red  herring.   Missing  payslips
    might  very  well  be  covered  by  the  evidential  flexibility  Rule.
    However, the point relied on by  the  Presenting  Officer  was  a  very
    different point that the panel neglected to consider.

13.  The fact that the appellant's  present  income  exceeds  the  threshold
    required does not entitle her to succeed in this appeal as  Mr  Bramble
    explained.  However, she has been found to be a highly credible witness
    who is genuinely married to the appellant and on the  current  evidence
    she does satisfy  the  income  threshold  by  virtue  of  her  salaried
    employment without reference to the income from her self-employment.

14.  As the appellant is  now  in  the  happy  position  of  fulfilling  the
    requirements of the Rules and need  simply  make  a  fresh  application
    armed with the appropriate evidence I do not consider that any arguable
    Article 8 issues arise.  It was open to her to present the  appropriate
    evidence at the relevant time and she now has  the  option  to  make  a
    fresh application.


Notice of Decision

I remake the decision.   The  appeal  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  is
allowed.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.


FEE AWARD

In all the circumstances I do not disturb the fee award  that  was  made  by
the panel in this case.
