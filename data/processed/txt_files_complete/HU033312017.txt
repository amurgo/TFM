                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. Although it is the Secretary of State who is appealing in these
       proceedings for convenience I will refer hereinafter to the parties
       as in the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. Mrs Touryakhil is a national of Afghanistan, born on 1 May 1991. She
       applied for entry clearance to join her husband, Mr Mohammad Shafa
       Touryakhil, hereinafter referred to as her sponsor. He is a British
       citizen.

    3. The application stated he worked in the Alum Rock Road branch of A1
       Supermarkets.

    4. Her application was refused on suitability grounds. The entry
       clearance officer concluded the representations about her sponsor's
       employment were false. The respondent's enquiries indicated that at
       the time of application A1 Supermarkets had 7 premises in Birmingham
       and Coventry. Checks revealed in 2011 this supermarket group was
       named as employing sponsors of two applications. In 2013 they were
       named in 6 applications. Between January 2014 and January 2016, 42
       applications named them. The respondent in December 2014 decided to
       defer making decisions on applications naming this employer until
       further enquiries were made.

    5. Sponsors were interviewed and there were apparent discrepancies in
       relation to employment details. The appellant's sponsor was also
       interviewed and was apparently unable to name colleagues and their
       duties and rates of pay.

    6. On 9 February 2016 immigration officers visited one branch of the
       supermarket chain and concluded that although sponsors were listed in
       HMRC records there was no evidence of them actually working and the
       supermarket was unable to provide payroll details. The premises
       appeared to have no more than 9 employees whereas one sponsor at
       interview suggested there were 18. Following this visit no further
       applications were made in which this supermarket was named as
       employer.

    7. The respondent took the view that the payments made to HMRC were
       contrived to suggest employment so as to support the applications.
       Reference was made to the variations in the salary ranges between
       �18,995 and �30,600. One sponsor said to be a cleaner claimed to have
       earned �31,800 which exceeded that earned by the store manager.

The First tier Tribunal

    8. The appellant's appeal was heard before Judge of the First-tier
       Tribunal Hetherington at Birmingham on 19 February 2018. Both parties
       were represented. In a decision promulgated on 26 February 2018 the
       appeal was allowed on human rights grounds.

    9. Paragraph 10 of the decision states:

           `There is no need for me to record in detail the complex
           provisions of the immigration rules or the comprehensive
           evidence in the appellant's bundle. Trading with the name using
           the letter `A' without other letters or numbers is perceived to
           give an alphabetical advantage in directories and is not
           confined to the sponsor's former employer. In English law
           limited companies have separate legal status. There is ample
           evidence testifying to the appellant's employment with A1 (Alum
           Rock Road) Limited including evidence from a director (pages 112-
           115 in the appellant's bundle) and the HMRC. This is a case were
           the appellant meets the financial requirements. The ECO has
           failed properly to investigate the employment of the sponsor. I
           find also that the entry clearance decision is updated'.

The Upper Tribunal

   10. Permission was granted because it was arguable there was an
       inadequacy of reasoning in relation to the issue arising and the
       judge failed to provide reasons for the conclusion reached.

   11. There is a rule 24 response. It is submitted that the judge gave
       reasons at paragraphs 10 and 12 of the decision as well as at
       paragraph 11.

   12. It is clear from the refusal letter the respondent had noted a
       pattern in certain entry clearance applications; with sponsors
       declaring income from employment with a company known as A1
       supermarkets Ltd. There was reference to the number of applications
       made in which this company featured resulted in decisions being
       deferred pending enquiries. Enquiries consisted of interviews with
       sponsors when apparent discrepancies were noted. Then, on 9 February
       2016 there was a site visit to one of the supermarkets which
       confirmed the respondent's suspicion. HMRC records showed the payment
       of income tax but the respondent took the view that the payments were
       part of an attempt to portray employment which was not actually
       taking place. The issue for the judge to decide was the genuineness
       of the employment.

   13. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal assert the sponsor
       was in genuine employment and the documents submitted support this.
       It was suggested the entry clearance officer had relied upon generic
       reasons. The decision was reviewed by the entry clearance manager.
       The manager states that the entry clearance officer gave a number of
       reasons for not accepting the sponsor's employment and did not rely
       upon generic reasons. The manager stated the decision was made after
       a careful screening process.

   14. For the appeal 2 bundles were provided on behalf of the appellant.
       The first was submitted in March 2017 and consisted of 17 items. The
       second bundle was submitted on 12 February 2018 and insisted 38
       items.

   15. The 1st bundle contains a statement from a Mr Atal, a British citizen
       originally from Afghanistan. In correspondence he is described as the
       managing director for A1 supermarket (Alum Rock) Limited. He states
       that A1 supermarkets Ltd is the registered name for a company trading
       from Stratford Road, Birmingham. He then refers to the other trading
       addresses and says that they are in fact operated by separate limited
       companies with similar names. The names are a variation on the A1
       supermarket name, primarily varying according to the address. For
       instance, one company was using the registered name `A1 Supermarket
       (Stratford Road) Ltd'. He also takes issue with the claimed visit on
       9 February 2016 by immigration officials stating that the businesses
       were closed at that time.

   16. The bundle contains a payroll printout in respect of the sponsor's
       employment. There is also a P60 for the year ending 5 April 2015
       showing the sponsor earned �17,610 a year of which �1520 was paid in
       tax. No tax was deducted in respect of previous employments. There is
       also P60 for the following year, stating he earned �19,199 of which
       �1717 was deducted in tax.

   17. The 2nd bundle contains a statement from the sponsor wherein he
       states he worked for A1 supermarket on Alum Rock Road until it
       closed. He then worked for the new supermarket until he became a taxi
       driver in April 2016. He refers to photographs showing him working.
       There are also statements from customers referring to the appellant's
       presence.

   18. The decision is extremely brief. It does not say what witnesses were
       called or what evidence was considered. Paragraph 10 is the only
       specific reference to the issues raised in the refusal. The judge
       accepts the sponsor's employment and following paragraph refers to
       provisions in section 117 B, stating the financial requirements in
       appendix FM are met.

Conclusions

   19. Whilst brevity is commendable the judge is required to evaluate the
       evidence presented and explain to the parties the reasoning behind
       the conclusion. It is wholly inadequate to simply refer to the appeal
       bundle and say its contents are being accepted. The judge was
       required to evaluate the application made and the evidence of
       employment. The judge was required to consider and evaluate what
       evidence there was in support of the suggested abuse. There may or
       may not have been records of the interviews with sponsors or of the
       visit to one of the premises. It is not apparent from the decision.
       There may have been carelessness in the naming and identifying the
       precise limited companies involved. All these matters require
       evaluation. The judge has not done this but has simply made a bald
       statement.

   20. The Secretary of States grounds of permission refer to the decision
       of Budhathoki (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 which
       commended brevity but did said it was necessary for judges to
       identify and resolve the conflicts in the evidence and to explain in
       clear albeit brief terms their reasons so that the parties can
       understand why they have won or lost. This is patently absent in the
       present decision. It may be that the respondent failed on an
       evidential basis to support the allegations. However, the judge does
       not explain this. Consequently, I find a material error of law
       requiring the decision to be set aside and the matter remitted for a
       fresh hearing de novo.

Decision.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal judge Hetherington allowing the appeal
of Mrs Touryakhil materially errs in law and is set aside to be re-heard de
novo in the First tier Tribunal. This appeal by the Secretary of State in
the present proceedings is allowed.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge     Date: 10th February 2019


Directions

    1. Relist for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal in Birmingham
       excluding Judge the First-tier Tribunal Heatherington.


    2. An interpreter is not required unless the appellant's representatives
       advise to the contrary.


    3. The issue in the appeal relates to genuineness of the sponsor's
       employment. No other issue had been taken by the respondent and the
       representatives should prepare accordingly. Reference should be made
       to the applicable legal and evidential burden of proof in respect of
       the respondent's allegations. Presumably, this would be akin to the
       English language personation cases.


    4. The respondent should provide details of the investigations that were
       carried out and be aware that limited companies, even with similar
       names, are separate entities though they may have common directors.
       The respondent should provide copies of the evidence relied upon to
       show abuse by the alleged employer; for instance, the interviews
       referred to and the site visit. As a guide in assessing the
       genuineness of the stated employment, the respondent should also set
       out what income tax and national insurance was paid by the sponsor


    5. If reliance is placed upon subsequent employment by the sponsor then
       the respondent should be advised in advance and asked to confirm if
       this is treated as a new matter and if consent is forthcoming.


    6. The application date is not clear but it appears to have been made a
       number of years ago. The appellant's representatives should check
       whether there is a full right of appeal or if it is restricted to
       human rights considerations.


    7. The hearing should take no more than 1 � hours.
