                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
Appellant     Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent    Mr Salam (Legal Representative)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. The respondent in these proceedings was  the  appellant  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal. From hereon I have referred to the  parties  as
       they were in the First-tier Tribunal so that for  example  reference
       to the respondent is a reference to the Secretary of State  for  the
       Home Department.

    2. I do not make an anonymity order  under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

    3. The appellant is  a  national  of  India.  On  April  25,  2012  the
       appellant entered the United Kingdom. On July 30, 2013 the appellant
       applied for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student  and  this
       was granted on September 4, 2013.

    4. On November 28, 2014 he applied for a residence card as the extended
       family member  of  an  EEA  national.  The  respondent  refused  his
       application on May 13, 2015.

    5.  The  appellant  appealed  that  decision  on  May  18,  2015  under
       Regulation  26  of  the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
       Regulations 2006 and Section 82(1) of the  Nationality,  Immigration
       and Asylum Act 2002 and his appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal Alty  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  "the  Judge"  on
       January 11, 2016. In a decision promulgated on January 22,  2016  he
       allowed his appeal under the 2006 Regulations.

    6. The respondent appealed the Judge's decision on January 27, 2016 and
       permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Martin on July 12, 2016.

    7. The matter came before me on the above date.



PRELIMINARY ISSUES

    8. I brought to  the  attention  of  both  representatives  the  recent
       decision of Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal)  [2016]  UKUT  00411.   The
       Tribunal made it clear that there is no statutory  right  of  appeal
       against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  not  to  grant  a
       residence card to a person claiming to be an Extended Family member.



    9. Mr Salam referred me to Regulation 26  which  provides  a  right  of
       appeal but I pointed out to him that this issue had been  argued  in
       the above case and the Tribunal's finding  was  that  there  was  no
       right of appeal.

   10. I therefore allow the respondent's appeal and set aside the  Judge's
       decision.



DECISION

   11. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law and I set aside the Judge's
       decision.

   12. The appellant has no right of appeal. The First-tier Tribunal had no
       jurisdiction to hear the appeal. It erred in law in doing so.

   13. I set aside the decision  to  allow  the  appeal  and  substitute  a
       decision that there was not a valid  appeal  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal and I  direct  that  no  further  steps  be  taken  by  the
       Tribunal.

TO THE RESPONDENT
