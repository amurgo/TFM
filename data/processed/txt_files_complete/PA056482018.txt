                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This was an appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge O'Keeffe, promulgated on 28th August 2018, following a hearing at
    Hatton Cross on 19th July and 8th August 2018.  In  the  determination,
    the  judge  dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the
    Appellant subsequently applied for,  and  was  granted,  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Iraq, and was born on  [~]  1968.
    He appealed against the decision of the  Respondent  dated  18th  April
    2018,  refusing  his  application  for  asylum  and  for   humanitarian
    protection under paragraph 329C of HC 395.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he is a Sunni Muslim,  and  a  successful
    businessman, from Iraq.  He had lent money to a  person  called  Ihsan,
    the money had not been paid back to him, and the Appellant had lodged a
    complaint through the courts.  His son was arrested and released by the
    police.  However, the Appellant then found out that the son  had  links
    to the Shia militia known as the "Asab Aha Al  Haw"  (AAH).   They  had
    control over the Iraqi  authorities  and  the  security  services.   In
    particular, his son had links to  the  commander  in  AAH,  called  Abu
    Namir.  Subsequently, the Appellant was kidnapped on  2nd  March  2017.
    He was accused of being a collaborator, and of selling  information  to
    the British, and Abu Namir questioned the Appellant.  The Appellant was
    beaten up, and his captors constantly abused him about his Sunni  sect.
    The Appellant was told that he would be released if he paid US$500,000.
     He said he did not have that sort of money.  He was given  his  mobile
    phone and he called his friend by the name Ismael [K].  The  phone  was
    then taken off the Appellant.  His friend, Ismael, then went on to  pay
    �300,000, which had successfully been negotiated, as the amount of  the
    ransom.  The Appellant was released he stayed with Ismael  for  a  week
    and then  stayed  with  various  friends.   On  15th  March  2017,  the
    Appellant transferred �150,000 into Ismael's account.   On  20th  March
    2017, the Appellant went to a  celebratory  lunch  due  to  having  his
    returned out of captivity successfully.  In order to repay his  friend,
    Ismael, the Appellant subsequently sold his share of a Dubai  business.



 4. The Appellant came to the UK on 18th  September  2017  and  planned  to
    return to Iraq on 27th September 2017.  However,  he  was  subsequently
    contacted by his lawyer and told that he should not return home because
    the AAH had kidnapped his brother.  Later he learnt  that  his  brother
    had been killed.

The Judge's Findings

 5. In a long and protracted decision, the judge held that the  Appellant's
    evidence was unreliable.  He had not been able to  demonstrate  on  the
    lower standard of proof that he had been kidnapped in Iraq as a  result
    of a business disagreement with Ishan.  His evidence of the kidnap  was
    not supported by medical evidence.  The payment of  a  ransom  was  not
    supported by bank statements provided by  the  Appellant.   There  were
    discrepancies in the lawyer's letter on his  behalf.   He  provided  no
    explanation as to why he would be warned to leave the area in 2017 when
    he had left Iraq in March 2017.

 6. The appeal was dismissed (see paragraphs 49 to 50).



Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state  that  the  judge  applied  the  wrong
    standard of proof, expected there to  be  corroboration  of  the  case,
    failed to recognise serious failings in  the  Home  Office  interpreter
    during the interview process,  made  impermissible  adverse  inferences
    from the asylum screening interview, misunderstood  key  parts  of  the
    Appellant's evidence, misread the Appellant's documents,  assessed  the
    evidence out of the social and political realities of Iraq in a  flawed
    manner, and failed to make findings in parts of the evidence provided.

 8. On 28th September 2018, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 9. On 22nd November 2018, there was  agreement  between  the  Respondent's
    representative, Mr Whitwell, and  the  Appellant's  representative,  Mr
    Moran, that the judge had erred in law, such that this matter should be
    returned back to the First-tier Tribunal to be  reheard  again.   There
    were extensive grounds of application, which Mr Moran  decided  not  to
    take the Tribunal through.  He focused on  a  few  court  matters,  and
    having done so, at that stage Mr Moran agreed that  he  would  have  to
    concede that there was an error of law in the judge's determination.

10. These matters, for example, consisted of the fact that  the  judge  had
    concluded that there was no evidence that the  Appellant's  friend,  Mr
    Ismael [K], had helped to pay a ransom of �300,000 for the  release  of
    the Appellant (see paragraph 39).  The judge had concluded that, "I was
    not provided with any evidence to show those transfers from Dubai".  Mr
    Moran submitted that this was simply not the case.  The  Appellant  had
    sold his business in Dubai and then made a deposit of �150,000 into the
    bank account for Mr [K].  Subsequently he had paid him in cash  �55,000
    and then �75,000.  There had been an agreement between the two of  them
    that this left �20,000 to be repaid, which would be done  subsequently.
    The suggestion that, "I was not provided  with  any  evidence  to  show
    those transfers from Dubai"  (40)  were  simply  incorrect.   This  was
    especially the case given that the judge recognised that, "Mr  [K]  was
    asked in cross-examination whether he had any documentary  evidence  of
    the ransom money leaving his account" (paragraph 41), and the  evidence
    before the judge had been that during the 1990s sanctions were  imposed
    on people who drew from a bank more than $200  at  a  time,  and  as  a
    result of this wealthy people  in  Iraq  decided  upon  a  practise  of
    keeping large amounts of money in their home, and  when  this  evidence
    was given before the Tribunal, the judge simply  said,  "This  entrance
    was not supported by the documentary  evidence  provided  of  his  bank
    statement" (paragraph 41).  Mr Moran submitted that this was  difficult
    to make sense of.

11. Similarly, the judge had stated, in relation  to  the  claim  that  Abu
    Namir, was the commander of the AAH, and the judge observed, "I was not
    provided  with  anything  independent  to  support  that  assertion  in
    circumstances where the Appellant might reasonably have  been  expected
    to provide such evidence" (paragraph 48).  However, this was  not  true
    because there was video evidence provided before  the  Tribunal,  which
    included footage of the commander Abu Namir, but more importantly  than
    even that, there were photographs provided which showed  Abu  Namir  in
    the pictures, which the witness had  actually  pointed  out,  and  this
    documentation also appeared in the Appellant's bundle (at pages  38  to
    41).

12. Moreover, the judge stated that, "The Appellant's claim  to  have  been
    kidnapped is not supported by the  medical  evidence"  (paragraph  49).
    The judge had also  stated  (at  paragraph  45)  that  the  Appellant's
    brother, [MI], was kidnapped on 24th  September  2017,  and  there  was
    written evidence to reflect that, after he was killed,  "The  body  was
    left in the street on 28th September 2017 which was the  same  date  of
    the kidnap" (paragraph 45).  The judge went on to say that,

         "The letter claims that  the  death  certificate  states  that  the
         victim was shot in the head and was left in the street.  Whilst the
         death certificate states that the cause of death was 'shots in  the
         head', nowhere does it state that the body was found in the street.
          The death certificate does not make any link between the death and
         any militia organisations" (paragraph 45).

13. Mr Moran rightly submitted that it is  not  the  province  of  a  death
    certificate to state  that  the  body  was  found  in  the  street,  or
    necessarily to make a link between the death and militia organisations.
     The judge had clearly overstretched herself in this respect.   As  for
    the statement (paragraph 49) that the Appellant's  own  kidnapping  was
    not supported by medical evidence, the injuries were  plainly  set  out
    and medical evidence never can specifically say that the  injuries  are
    caused as a direct result of a particular form of ill-treatment.

14. For his part, Mr Whitwell submitted that he would have  to  agree  that
    the determination of the judge was  a  "dense  determination"  but,  in
    addition to that, having heard the points raised by Mr Moran, he  would
    have to agree that there was an error of  law,  and  that  this  matter
    should be remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   He  asked  that
    directions be given that a properly compiled  bundle  of  documents  be
    submitted.  It was also  agreed  that  the  judge's  criticism  of  the
    screening interview, where she states that the Appellant's brother  had
    not been identified as a person who had been murdered, was  unwarranted
    because the screening interview was in relation to the  Appellant,  and
    not to the Appellant's brother, and is only a short summary of the core
    nature of the Appellant's claim.

Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision, for the  reasons  that
    have been agreed upon both by Mr Whitwell and Mr Moran.

Notice of Decision

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law, such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the
    decision of the regional judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as  follows.
    This  appeal  is  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be
    determined by a judge other than Judge O'Keeffe, pursuant  to  Practice
    Statement 7.2(b), because the nature of the fact-finding has been  such
    that the Appellant has not had a fair hearing. I give directions that a
    properly compiled  bundle  of  documents  be  submitted  for  the  next
    Hearing.

17. No anonymity direction is made.

18. This appeal is allowed.
