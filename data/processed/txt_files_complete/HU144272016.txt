                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Somalia, seeking  entry  clearance  as  a
    partner under the Immigration Rules.  Entry clearance was refused in  a
    decision of 6 May 2016.  The refusal was  based  on  two  matters,  the
    first matter being that the sponsor narrowly missed out on meeting  the
    financial requirements.  Secondly,  the  appellant  did  not  pass  the
    requisite English language test to meet  the  Rules.   There  being  no
    exceptional  circumstances  outside  the  Rules,  entry  clearance  was
    refused.

2.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Sweet  on  2  November  2017.
    Although  the  appellant  had  now  obtained   the   English   language
    certificate the refusal was upheld on the basis that  at  the  time  of
    application or refusal he had  not.   Similarly,  the  concerns  as  to
    finances were also upheld.

3.   Challenge was made to the decision on the  basis  that  the  judge  had
    fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the appeal that  was  lodged.
    It was an appeal in respect of Article 8.  The appellant  worked  as  a
    junior doctor in Somalia, having obtained a  medical  degree  from  the
    Hargeisa University which was conducted in the English  language.   The
    appellant's spouse was born in Kuwait  and  married  the  applicant  in
    Somalia on 5 August 2013.  She earns about �15,000 as a  special  needs
    teacher for the London Borough of Hillingdon and has savings of �5,500.
     She also has a young child born on 19 June  2017.   She  also  has  an
    older child aged 12 by a previous relationship.  She was married to the
    father of that child but has since divorced.  The child  is  a  British
    citizen.

4.   Leave to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  by  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Taylor on 13 March 2018 on the basis that the judge  did
    not engage with the fact that it was a human rights appeal nor did  the
    judge take into account all the evidence and submissions  made.   Under
    the Rules the earnings of the sponsor were clearly relevant.  In  terms
    of human rights little account was taken of the fact that the appellant
    was also a skilled professional able to engage in earning once  he  had
    come to the United Kingdom.  There was also a suggestion of third party
    support.  It was contended that in matters of human rights the language
    certificate was not required  but  in  the  event  that  had  now  been
    obtained.  The evidence of the appellant's wife was that she was unable
    to live in Somalia and accordingly family life  could  not  be  enjoyed
    there but needed to be enjoyed in the United Kingdom.

5.   Mr Durm conceded that the Judge had fallen into error  in  not  looking
    at the wider context in terms of  human  rights  rather  than  narrowly
    focusing  upon  the  requirements  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   In
    particular that the judge had failed to take into account  the  matters
    set out in the judgment of MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10 which  had  been
    promulgated on 10 August 2017.

6.   It is noted that there was a change  to  the  regime,  particularly  in
    terms of financial support and that third party support  and/or  a  job
    offer  could  be  taken  into  account   in   meeting   the   financial
    requirements.  The appellant as a  doctor  would  clearly  be  able  to
    command a substantial salary were he able to come to the United Kingdom
    and documents were presented at the hearing to show  significant  third
    party support from the sponsor's sister and her husband.  There  was  a
    letter in particular from Mrs Jama, who is the sister of  the  sponsor,
    indicating that she would also provide third party support.  She  works
    as a primary school teacher with an earned income of around �33,000 per
    annum on a  permanent  job.   She  lives  with  her  husband  and  four
    children.  He also works as  a  chauffeur  and  his  annual  salary  is
    �30,000 per annum.  There are family savings of �15,000  and  ownership
    of the house.  Financial support in the region of �300 per month  would
    be made available and Mr Durm confirmed that such support would  indeed
    meet the requirements of the Rules.    Mr Durm  however  was  concerned
    that there needed to be some confirmation from the husband that he  was
    willing for those monies to be used in that way and that  he  would  be
    lending support to it.

7.   In this case there is clearly also the  element  of  the  British  born
    child, who cannot reasonably be expected to relocate to  Somalia,  also
    the best interests of two children need to be considered.  Applying the
    principles of 117B it is clear that the appellant would be of no burden
    to the state were he to come, indeed his  qualifications  would  be  no
    doubt much sought after.

8.   It is perhaps unnecessary to dwell over  much  on  the  merits  of  the
    matter as Mr Durm fairly conceded that,  subject  to  the  conformation
    from the sister's husband, he would concede that the appeal  should  be
    allowed.  Responsibility is upon the appellant's solicitors  to  submit
    the appropriate evidence but subject to that this appeal stands allowed
    on the basis of human rights and Article 8 in particular.

Notice of Decision

The appellant's appeal is allowed before the Upper  Tribunal.  The  decision
of the First tier Tribunal is set aside to be remade by the Upper  Tribunal.
This I now do in the light of the concessions made.
The appeal is allowed in respect of human Rights and Article 8 ECHR.

No anonymity direction is made.
