Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms K Monaghan QC, Ms S Knight and Mr A MacKenzie
      instructed by Luqmani Thompson & Partners in the case of RS
      instructed by Refugee & Migrant Justice in the case of EC
      instructed by Harrison Bundey in the case of BR
For the Respondent:    Ms E Grey and Mr C Thomann, instructed by the
Treasury Solicitor

    (1)    A significant number  of  people  are  receiving  treatment  for
    HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe, and hence a Zimbabwean returnee will not  succeed
    in a claim for international protection on the basis of a diagnosis  of
    HIV/AIDS unless their case crosses the  threshold  identified  in  N  v
    United Kingdom.

(2)   Though there is some evidence of  discrimination  in  access  to  AIDS
    medication and food in Zimbabwe, it is not such as to show a real  risk
    of such discrimination.

(3)   The return to Zimbabwe of a Zimbabwean diagnosed  with  HIV/AIDS  does
    not place the United Kingdom in breach of  its  obligations  under  the
    Disability Discrimination Act.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    These are the appeals of three female  Zimbabwean  nationals  born  in
    June 1977, 24 September 1964 and 16 November 1957  respectively.   They
    all claim to have a well founded fear of  persecution  if  returned  to
    Zimbabwe as they would be unable to demonstrate  loyalty  to  ZANU  PF,
    their removal would breach their human rights (Articles 3,  8  and  14)
    and  their  rights  under  section  21D  and  21E  of  the   Disability
    Discrimination Act 1995 would be breached.  All  three  appellants  are
    HIV positive and are receiving NHS treatment.

2.    This appellant was born in Chigutu.  She was  educated  in  Gokwe  and
    last lived in Dema Seke, about an  hour's  journey  from  Harare.   She
    arrived at Gatwick airport on 21 February 2001 to visit her husband who
    was a student here at that time  (although  in  her  subsequent  asylum
    interview in October 2006, she claimed that he had returned to Zimbabwe
    in the year 2000).  He had entered the UK as a visitor in February 2000
    and thereafter remained as a student, with leave.   The  appellant  was
    admitted as a visitor for six months and subsequently  commenced  Bible
    studies here as a result of which she was granted 12 months' leave as a
    student (until 30 September 2002).  Their children remained  living  in
    Zimbabwe and were cared for by relatives in Dema.  In August 2001  both
    she and her husband were diagnosed as HIV-positive and  both  commenced
    anti-retroviral treatment (ART).  Her husband was said to have returned
    to Zimbabwe following the death of his father in 2002.

3.    On 25 September 2002, before the expiry of her  leave  to  enter,  the
    appellant made an application to remain for a limited period to undergo
    private  medical  treatment.   However,  a  letter  from   her   former
    representatives accompanying her application form  indicated  that  she
    was entitled to benefit from NHS  treatment  and  the  application  was
    treated by the Secretary of State as having been made to  receive  free
    medical treatment for an indefinite period.  The  appellant  stated  on
    her application form that she intended to leave the UK in October  2005
    and that she received �600 every month from a relative  or  friend.   A
    letter dated 16 September 2002 from her consultant, Mr Derrick Evans of
    Southend Hospital, confirmed that although she had been diagnosed  with
    HIV in August 2001, she had probably had the disease for  approximately
    seven or eight years.

4.    The application was refused on  5  January  2004.   The  Secretary  of
    State balanced the compassionate aspects against the need  to  maintain
    immigration control.  He considered that the resources of the NHS  were
    limited and that it would be unrealistic to expect  the  NHS  to  treat
    everyone who could not obtain treatment of a similar standard in  their
    own country.  He considered that the medical  evidence  indicated  that
    the appellant was fit to travel, and that she had been  working  for  a
    long period of time.  He noted that medical treatment was available  in
    Zimbabwe and that the appellant's husband,  three  children  and  other
    family members lived there.  He noted that the appellant's studies  had
    been funded by her sisters-in-law, P (in the USA) and M  (in  the  UK),
    and that funds were said to  be  available  for  the  cost  of  private
    treatment in the UK.  He considered there was no reason why these funds
    could not be provided to the  appellant  in  Zimbabwe  particularly  as
    treatment would be cheaper there than in the UK.  He concluded that the
    immigration rules made no provision for leave to  be  granted  for  the
    purpose sought and that under the applicable policy,  this  was  not  a
    case where exceptional leave should be granted.

5.    An appeal  was  lodged  against  that  decision  and  came  before  Mr
    Gillespie, sitting as an adjudicator at  Hatton  Cross  on  21  October
    2004.  In support of her appeal, the  appellant  provided  a  statement
    dated 11 October 2004.  She  maintained  that  she  had  been  born  in
    Chigutu, a rural district about  110  km  south-west  of  Harare.   Her
    parents were alive and lived in Gokwe, several hundred kilometres  west
    of Harare.  They moved there in 1990.  She claimed to have  one  sister
    and four brothers; a fifth brother had died  the  previous  year.   Her
    sister, J, was married and had four children.  Her brother L  was  also
    married with two children. These siblings lived with their families  in
    Gokwe.  Her three younger brothers were unmarried and lived with  their
    parents.  Two of them were still at school. The rest  of  her  siblings
    were unemployed.  The appellant stated that  she  had  lived  in  Gokwe
    until 1995 when she was married and went to live in Dema.  She has  two
    children.  They are currently looked after  by  her  sister-in-law,  F.
    The appellant claimed that she and  her  family  had  always  been  MDC
    supporters.  This had caused problems with  food  distribution  in  the
    village.  When food arrived it was  distributed  according  to  a  list
    drawn up by regional ZANU PF supporters who were able to  identify  the
    families who did not regularly attend their meetings.  They  were  then
    put last on the list.  She maintained that in August 2004 her  brother-
    in-law was killed and his house was burnt down.  The  hospital  refused
    to treat him because he was  an  MDC  supporter  and  he  died  of  his
    injuries.  She stated that her husband  had  come  here  to  visit  his
    sister and had subsequently obtained a student visa to study English on
    a three-year course.  He stayed  with  his  sister  M,  with  whom  the
    appellant also lived after her arrival.  M was recognised as a  refugee
    in 2002.  The appellant stated that her husband returned to Zimbabwe in
    August 2002 following the death of his father and was not receiving any
    treatment as there was none available in his area.

6.    The Adjudicator found that the appellant  would  not  have  access  to
    consistent and adequate ART in Zimbabwe and that  her  family  was  not
    affluent and could not guarantee financial assistance.  He  noted  that
    the appellant's mother-in-law was said to  have  fallen  seriously  ill
    while visiting P in the USA and the appellant maintained that the claim
    in her application form  that  she  received  �600  a  month  had  been
    fabricated by her previous representatives.  He found that on return to
    Zimbabwe it was likely that the appellant would live  in  circumstances
    of privation.  He found that she would  be  unable  to  access  private
    treatment.  He considered  there  would  be  a  rapid  decline  in  the
    appellant's health on return and that life expectancy would be no  more
    than one or two years at most as against a possible  10  years  on  her
    present regimen.  He  found  that  the  appellant's  husband  lived  in
    poverty and was unable to obtain medical treatment  without  production
    of a  ZANU  PF  card.   He  lived  in  fear  of  threats  of  political
    intimidation.  His brother had been killed the previous month  and  his
    house  had  been  destroyed.   He  concluded  that  in  the   "peculiar
    circumstances" of this case the Article 3 threshold had  been  met  and
    allowed the appeal.  The determination was promulgated  on  29  October
    2004.

7.    On 3 November 2004, the respondent applied for permission  to  appeal.
    It was argued that the adjudicator had failed to take into account  the
    jurisprudence of the higher courts and that he had failed to reason how
    the appellant would fall into the exceptional category as outlined in N
    v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2003]  EWCA  Civ  1369,
    given that she had family  in  Zimbabwe  and  that  medical  treatment,
    whilst expensive, would be available.  Permission to appeal was granted
    on 25 January 2005. When the  appeal  came  before  Senior  Immigration
    Judge Warr on 12 July 2006, he found with the consent  of  the  parties
    that following the decision of the Tribunal in JM* Liberia [2006] UKAIT
    00009, the Tribunal was without jurisdiction as the appellant's removal
    was not imminent, this being a variation appeal.

8.    Despite the agreement of the parties, the appellant's  representatives
    sought permission to  appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  against  that
    decision.  It was  submitted  that  JM  was  wrongly  decided  and  the
    Tribunal had erred in concluding that on an appeal against a refusal to
    vary leave, the question of the compatibility with human  rights  of  a
    hypothetical return was not justiciable.  That application was  refused
    by Senior Immigration  Judge  Jordan  on  7  August  2006.   A  renewed
    application was made to the Court of Appeal on 27 August 2006.  It  was
    argued that as permission to appeal had been granted in the case of  JM
    and was listed for hearing by the Court of Appeal, that the application
    in the instant case should have been stayed until judgment  was  issued
    in JM or should have been granted pending  judgment.   On  29  December
    2006 Laws LJ ordered that the  court  was  satisfied  that  the  appeal
    should be allowed and remitted to the AIT for reconsideration before  a
    differently constituted Tribunal on  the  basis  of  the  statement  of
    reasons which had been agreed by the parties.  The statement said  that
    following  the  Court  of  Appeal's  decision  to  overturn   JM,   the
    determination of the AIT in  the  appellant's  case  should  no  longer
    stand.  The nature of the reconsideration was left open to the AIT.

9.    Meanwhile, on 6 March 2006, the  appellant  claimed  asylum.   At  her
    asylum interview conducted on 4 October 2006, she claimed to have  been
    active with the MDC since its formation  in  1999.   She  claimed  that
    husband was also involved as were her family members.  Her husband  was
    known to the authorities as an MDC member as  were  his  sisters.   She
    maintained  that  she  had  attended  rallies,  distributed   T-shirts,
    bandanas and leaflets  and  sold  cards.   She  claimed  to  have  been
    arrested three times.  The first occasion was in 2000 when she had been
    selling T-shirts in Dema.  She was taken  to  the  police  station  and
    beaten with ropes and questioned for about two hours  after  which  she
    was released.   Her  sister-in-law  and  some  seven  others  had  been
    arrested with her. She was told not to sell  T-shirts  in  the  future.
    The second arrest also took place in Dema in 2000.   On  that  occasion
    she was attending a rally and she was one of many that  were  arrested.
    No further details were provided of this arrest or of the  third.   The
    appellant claimed that she had relatives here who were  granted  asylum
    in 2003 or 2004.

10.   The asylum application was refused on 10 October 2006.  An appeal  was
    lodged against the decision  and  on  3  November  2006  the  appellant
    prepared a statement, presumably in anticipation of  her  hearing.   In
    that statement she gave the month of her birth as May, rather than June
    (this  is  corrected  in  the  third  witness  statement).   She   also
    maintained that her student leave was given until the 30 November  2002
    rather than 30 September 2002 which was previously  claimed  and  which
    was evidenced by the copy of her passport.  She  also  maintained  that
    she was diagnosed as being HIV-positive in August 2002.  She maintained
    that she made a successful application for discretionary leave.  In her
    statements the appellant also maintained that both she and her  husband
    remained active MDC members.  Her activities were said to  continue  in
    the UK but are limited for financial reasons.  She  referred  to  three
    arrests in Zimbabwe all  of  which  took  place  in  2000.   The  first
    detention lasted some two hours and occurred when she was taken to  the
    police station for selling MDC  T-shirts.   On  the  second  and  third
    occasions she had been  at  rallies  handing  out  MDC  material.   She
    maintained that she did not come  to  the  UK  with  the  intention  of
    claiming asylum.  In 2004 she was advised by her husband not to  return
    because of the dangers she would face.

11.   When the appeal came before an immigration judge at Hatton Cross on  8
    December  2006  (coincidentally,  it  was  IJ  Gillespie  who   as   an
    adjudicator had determined her human rights appeal),  the  hearing  was
    adjourned because proceedings with regard to the  human  rights  appeal
    were still  outstanding.   The  asylum  appeal  was  re-listed  for  19
    February 2007 so that the two matters could be  merged.   The  February
    hearing was subsequently adjourned (it is unclear why) and  the  matter
    then came before Senior Immigration Judge Gleeson at Field House  on  6
    June 2007.  She found that the adjudicator made a material error of law
    and  that  any  difficulties  the  appellant  may  face  in   accessing
    medication did not meet the N threshold.  She then proceeded to  decide
    the substantive appeal but appears  to  have  only  decided  the  human
    rights issue. The appeal  was  dismissed  by  way  of  a  determination
    promulgated on 23  July  2007.   The  asylum  issues  have  never  been
    determined.

12.   On 3 August 2007 the appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Court of Appeal on the basis that no material error  of  law  had  been
    identified.  The application was refused by  Senior  Immigration  Judge
    Batiste but granted on renewal by Sir Henry Brooke on 7 December  2007.
    The matter then came before Pill, Arden and Longmore  LJJ  on  18  July
    2008. The  court  found  that  Senior  Immigration  Judge  Gleeson  had
    correctly identified an error of law by the adjudicator  but  that  her
    subsequent approach could not be justified as there was material  which
    required analysis.  The matter  was  therefore  remitted  for  a  fresh
    hearing of the Article 3 claim.  In so doing  Pill  LJ  criticised  the
    intemperate language used by the adjudicator and advised  that  a  more
    substantial factual analysis was required to justify  it.   He  stated:
    "If the general conduct of government is to be condemned in this way, a
    cogent statement of the factual basis for  condemnation  is  required".
    Arden LJ suggested that "great care would have to be taken to determine
    whether the lack of medical facilities or food is due to the infliction
    of deliberate harm on the appellants or whether  the  lack  of  medical
    facilities is due to a lack of national  resources  for  this  purpose.
    The Tribunal will also need to determine the level  of  seriousness  of
    any actual or threatened harm and the cause of such harm.  It may  also
    need to determine whether any actual or  threatened  harm  would  be  a
    serious if it were not for the appellant's medical condition".

13.   A Case Management Review hearing was  then  arranged.   On  19  August
    2009 the respondent was directed to  consider  this  case,  along  with
    those of the other two appellants which  had  been  co-listed,  in  the
    light of the determination in RN (Returnees) Zimbabwe CG  [2008]  UKAIT
    00083.  This was done and the response from  the  respondent  is  dated
    September 2009. In  this  appellant's  case,  the  Secretary  of  State
    considered that she had failed to establish  the  facts  on  which  she
    wished to rely.  It was noted that the appellant delayed making a claim
    for asylum by over seven years and that she  had  argued  her  case  on
    medical grounds until the  promulgation  of  RN.   He  noted  that  the
    appellant had lived with her sister-in-law who had successfully claimed
    asylum and that  it  was  therefore  reasonable  to  assume  that  she,
    herself, would have been aware of the option of claiming  asylum.   The
    Secretary of State noted the appellant had family in Zimbabwe and  they
    were not subject to political intimidation.  The appellant did not have
    a political profile in her own  right;  she  was  not  subject  to  any
    targeted  ill-treatment  and  would  not  have  any  profile  with  the
    authorities.

14.   A third witness statement has been prepared by the  appellant  and  is
    dated 19 January 2010.  In it, she adopts her previous statements.  She
    maintained that her family moved with her to Gokwe in 1992.   She  also
    maintained that she was unable to continue with her studies  once  they
    moved there.  She mentioned for the first time that both  she  and  her
    husband were arrested for distributing T-shirts and selling  cards  and
    leaflets.  They were kept at  the  police  station  overnight  and  her
    sister-in-law, M, who had also been arrested with them,  was  raped  by
    the police. The appellant claimed that she was touched  by  the  police
    officers in a sexual  way  in  front  of  her  husband.   Although  she
    explained that she did not mention this in her 2004  statement  because
    that application was only concerned with her ill health,  she  did  not
    explain  why  it  was  omitted  from  her  2006  statement  which   was
    specifically prepared for her asylum appeal.  She  maintained  that  at
    "other times" she was arrested for a few hours when MDC  meetings  were
    broken up.  Her husband was also arrested on these occasions.   On  two
    occasions she and her  husband  were  held  overnight.   This  was  not
    mentioned before.  On  another  occasion  they  were  released  in  the
    evening after a few hours of detention.

15.   The appellant said that because of her activities,  she,  her  husband
    and their  children  were  not  included  in  food  distribution.   She
    maintained that  her  husband  was  arrested  on  more  occasions  than
    herself, and maintained that when her student leave was  completed  she
    saw that the situation in Zimbabwe was deteriorating and  in  order  to
    find a way of remaining longer in the UK she decided to  claim  asylum.
    She maintained that her brother-in-law was killed in a  house  fire  in
    August 2002 because he was an MDC supporter.

16.   In her statement the appellant said that her  husband,  children,  her
    husband's sister and her children survive on US $10 a month.  They were
    denied food aid due to their MDC connections.  In 2004 and 2008  during
    the time of the elections, ZANU PF thugs came to  the  house  and  beat
    them.  Sometimes they had to go into hiding in order to be  safe.   The
    appellant was unsure whether her husband has been  arrested  since  his
    return in 2002.  In the last few months he has  been  bed  ridden.  The
    appellant maintained that her father died in 2004  and  her  mother  in
    2005.  Her mother-in-law is supported by relatives in the USA and  does
    not share the  money  with  the  appellant's  husband.   The  appellant
    expressed concern that her husband is reaching the end of his life  and
    hoped that her children can be reunited with her in the UK in the  near
    future.

17.   Dr  Day's  medical  report  of  4  February  2010  confirms  that  the
    appellant is  on  the  following  regimen;  Tenofovir,  Zidovudine  and
    Efavirenz.  She remains a low grade Hepatitis B chronic carrier at very
    low risk of future complications.  Her latest CD4 count on  1  February
    2010 was 623 and she has a fully suppressed HIV viral load of less than
    50 copies/ml.  Her life expectancy is said to be less than  five  years
    if medication is stopped.

EC

18.   This appellant was born in Gutu; she  grew  up  in  Harare  where  she
    lived from the age of two with her parents and siblings.  She  attended
    school from 1971 until 1984 and left secondary  school  with  seven  O-
    levels.  She  then  attended  a  secretarial  college  and  obtained  a
    diploma.  In 1987 she commenced employment with a bank, remaining  with
    them until December 2001.  She separated from her husband in  2000  and
    he lived in South Africa until his death last year.  Her  two  children
    remain living in Harare with her mother.

19.   In September 2001 the appellant came to the UK for a short holiday  to
    visit her mother's distant cousin, Mr M Manhuna; she refers to  him  as
    her uncle.  He worked for the Zimbabwe High Commission in  London.   On
    21 December  2001  she  returned  to  visit  him  for  Christmas.   She
    maintains that she fell ill and was diagnosed  with  pneumonia.   Tests
    were undertaken and she was  diagnosed  as  being  HIV  positive.   She
    maintains that she had no idea she was  ill  prior  to  this.   Medical
    evidence dated 27 May 2002 from Southend Hospital  indicates  that  she
    would, however, have had the disease for ten years or more.   She  then
    went to live with her cousins, Flo  and  Chipo,  daughters  of  another
    uncle.  She continues to live with Flo.  She maintains that her  mother
    is disabled following a stroke, her father is elderly and  has  limited
    means, her brother is deaf and cannot work and the  family  rely  on  a
    relative who provides them with  maize.   Her  sister  lives  with  her
    mother-in-law in a village.  There are other distant relatives but they
    are all struggling to survive.  The appellant has not felt able to tell
    any of her family that she is HIV positive.

20.   On 5 June 2002 the appellant applied to remain in the UK in  order  to
    receive NHS treatment.  Her application was  accompanied  by  a  letter
    from her uncle promising  financial  support  for  her  studies.   That
    application was refused on  25  June  2003.   The  Secretary  of  State
    considered that there were no provisions under the Immigration Rules to
    enable an applicant to remain to receive free medical  treatment.   The
    policy guidelines introduced on 19 December 2000 were considered.   The
    Secretary of State considered that  NHS  resources  were  limited.   He
    noted that the appellant had had the disease for many years,  that  she
    was fit to travel and that she had a family in Zimbabwe.  He considered
    it was not suitable to grant exceptional leave in this case.  An appeal
    was lodged on 2 July 2003.  Articles 3 and 8 were relied on.

21.   In September 2003 the appellant commenced a course of studies.   On  6
    October 2003 she then made an application to remain as a student.   Her
    cousin, Chipo, undertook to finance her studies  and  to  support  her.
    The Secretary of State noted that section 3C  of  the  Immigration  Act
    1971 (as inserted by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) prevented the
    appellant from making a fresh application whilst an appeal was pending.
     However, her student application was treated as  a  variation  of  the
    original application and was then considered.  The Secretary  of  State
    was not satisfied that  the  appellant  met  the  requirements  of  the
    student  rules  as  her  college  was  not  on   the   DfES   register.
    Furthermore, there was no evidence to show  satisfactory  progress  had
    been made.  As the appellant had previously indicated that  she  wanted
    to remain indefinitely in the UK, the Secretary of State was  also  not
    satisfied that the appellant would leave the  UK  at  the  end  of  her
    studies.  The application was therefore refused on  29  November  2006.
    On 6 February  2007  the  Secretary  of  State  wrote  to  clarify  the
    position.  He noted that as the student application had been made at  a
    time when the appellant had no  leave  to  be  here  other  than  under
    section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971, she could not seek to vary  her
    leave during that period.  As the original application had already been
    decided, it was no longer possible to seek to vary it and so there  was
    no outstanding student application.  In any event,  the  appellant  has
    indicated in her witness statement that she does  not  wish  to  pursue
    this matter.

22.   On 21 February  2007  the  appellant's  representatives  informed  the
    Tribunal that the appellant wished to rely  on  asylum  grounds.   They
    indicated that the appellant's previous advisers had told her she could
    only apply on medical grounds.

23.   On 12 March 2007 the appeal came before Immigration Judge  E  B  Grant
    at Hatton Cross.  She  heard  oral  evidence  from  the  appellant  but
    dismissed  the  appeal  on  asylum  and  human  rights  grounds  in   a
    determination promulgated on 10 May 2007.   She  also  found  that  the
    appellant was not entitled to humanitarian protection.  An  application
    for reconsideration was sought and obtained by the appellant on 5  June
    2007.  The matter was heard on 7 September 2007 by  Senior  Immigration
    Judge Jarvis who found  a  material  error  of  law  in  Judge  Grant's
    determination and ordered a second stage  reconsideration.   That  took
    place before Immigration Judges Neuberger and Dawson at Taylor House on
    18 March and 20 May 2008.  In a statement prepared on  18  March  2008,
    the appellant maintains that her  former  partner  has  died  in  South
    Africa.  She maintains that  her  mother's  cousin  (Mr  Manhuna)  left
    London in 2005 and she does not know where he is.  She believes he  has
    retired.  It is noted that she gave evidence to Immigration Judge Grant
    that his son lived in Northampton and that she had his telephone number
    and  could  contact  her  uncle  through  him.   In   a   determination
    promulgated on 2 June 2008, the appeal was dismissed on all grounds.

24.   On 17 June 2008 an application for permission to appeal to  the  Court
    of Appeal was made on the  appellant's  behalf.   The  application  was
    refused by Senior Immigration Judge  Freeman  on  26  June  2008.   The
    application was renewed to the Court of Appeal but refused by  Laws  LJ
    on 21 August 2008.  A further application was made and  on  27  October
    2008 Rix and Carnwath LJJ granted permission to appeal.   On  17  March
    2009 Rix LJ ordered by consent that the determination be set aside  and
    the appeal be  remitted  for  second  stage  reconsideration  with  all
    matters open.

25.   On 2 September 2009 the Secretary of  State  responded  to  directions
    set at a Case Management Review hearing that the case be looked  at  in
    the light of RN.  The Secretary of State noted that the  appellant  had
    delayed making an asylum claim for five years and had relied on medical
    grounds until the promulgation of RN.  He noted that the appellant  had
    family  in  Harare  and  that  they  were  not  subject  to   political
    intimidation.  The appellant had no political  profile  and  had  never
    claimed political interest.  There was no evidence  to  show  that  she
    would attract the adverse interest of the authorities on return.

26.   A medical report from Dr Day at Southend Hospital  dated  12  February
    2010 confirms that the appellant  has  been  under  the  care  of  that
    hospital since February 2002 when she requested a sexual health screen.
     There is no reference to any diagnosis of pneumonia.  She  was  tested
    positive for HIV with a CD4 count of only 36.  She also had seborrhoeic
    dermatitis and oral candida.   She  responded  well  to  Efavirenz  and
    Combivir.  Her last test showed an HIV viral load count of less than 50
    copies/ml and a CD4 count of 597.  In April  2009  her  medication  was
    simplified and she takes one tablet of Atripla  daily;  this  does  not
    require refrigeration.  Alternative drug regimes  are  expected  to  be
    effective in her case and an earlier report in February  2007  from  Dr
    Day indicated that her medication  could  be  adjusted  to  alternative
    drugs such as the most affordable ones in Zimbabwe.  The  cessation  of
    treatment would put her life expectancy at less than three years.

BR

27.   This appellant is from  Chitungwiza  Town,  an  MDC  stronghold.   She
    first came to the UK on 16 February 2001 and was admitted as a  visitor
    for six months.  She returned to Zimbabwe on 9 March 2001 returning  to
    the UK on  2  December  2001  when  she  was  accompanied  by  her  two
    grandchildren (children of her daughter S) and claimed to  be  visiting
    her other daughter, M, a student nurse.  The  Immigration  Officer  was
    told that S was living in Zimbabwe and had no intention  of  travelling
    to Zimbabwe as she could not get time off work.  They were all admitted
    for six months.  They all overstayed.

28.   On 20 August 2002 the appellant sought to regularise her stay.  It  is
    not known what happened to the children.   The  appellant  applied  for
    indefinite leave to remain on compassionate grounds.   An  accompanying
    letter from her solicitor stated  that  she  had  been  diagnosed  with
    advanced HIV infection.  In a later letter her solicitors notified  the
    Home Office that the  appellant  was  receiving  �100  a  fortnight  in
    hardship money from Barnados.  The appellant had two daughters  in  the
    UK, S in Leeds and M who was studying in Bristol.  She had four sisters
    in Zimbabwe who lived with their families.

29.   The application was refused on 14 April 2004.  The Secretary of  State
    considered that there were no provisions under the Immigration Rules to
    enable an applicant to remain to receive free medical  treatment  under
    the NHS. NHS resources were limited.  The policy guidelines  introduced
    on 19  December  2000  were  considered.   Overstayers  would  only  be
    permitted to remain  here  to  access  free  treatment  in  exceptional
    circumstances.  The Secretary of State considered  that  the  appellant
    was fit to travel and had a family in  Zimbabwe.   He  considered  that
    treatment was available in Zimbabwe.  He  concluded  that  a  grant  of
    exceptional leave was not suitable in this case.

30.   As her leave had expired at the time she  made  her  application,  the
    appellant had no right of appeal on immigration grounds.  She does  not
    appear to have pursued her human rights claim at that  stage.   Nothing
    further was heard from her for over a year.  Then on 5  July  2005  she
    applied for leave to remain as the dependant of a  work  permit  holder
    (her daughter, M) who had permission to work here  until  6  May  2009.
    The application was refused on 6 February 2007.  The Secretary of State
    noted that only the spouses and children of work  permit  holders  were
    allowed to remain as their dependants under the Immigration Rules.  She
    could not remain as a dependent parent as her daughter was not  settled
    in the UK.  The  other  daughter  was  a  failed  asylum  seeker.   The
    appellant's circumstances were considered under paragraph 395C but were
    not found to merit a  grant  of  exceptional  leave.   The  appellant's
    application was also refused on human rights grounds.  On  14  February
    2007  the  appellant  lodged  an  appeal.   Her  appeal  was  heard  by
    Immigration Judge Britton at Newport.  Asylum does not appear  to  have
    been relied on and the appeal was dismissed on human rights grounds  in
    a determination promulgated on 1 April 2007.

31.   On 19 April 2007  an  application  for  reconsideration  was  made  on
    behalf of the appellant.  On 1 May 2007  this  was  granted  by  Senior
    Immigration Judge Freeman who then sat with  Senior  Immigration  Judge
    Jordan on 22 July 2007 to hear the  matter.   The  panel  decided  that
    there was a material error of law in the  determination  and  that  the
    matter  should  be  re-heard.   It  was  conceded  by  the  appellant's
    representative that there was no realistic prospect of personal risk to
    the appellant on the basis of her individual history "outside the  lack
    of  favour  that  might  be  shown  to  her  in  connection  with  AIDS
    treatment".  It was flagged up as a possible country guidance  case  on
    the issue of the availability and distribution of medical treatment for
    HIV sufferers.

32.   There followed the Case Management Review hearing common  to  all  the
    appellants on 19 August 2009 following which the appellant's  case  was
    considered under the RN guidelines by the Secretary  of  State.   In  a
    letter dated 2 September 2009 the Secretary of  State  found  that  the
    appellant had waited seven years to claim asylum.  She had relied  upon
    her medical condition until after RN had been  promulgated.   He  noted
    that the appellant  could  be  expected  to  have  known  about  asylum
    previously as her daughter had been an asylum seeker.  The  appellant's
    sisters in Zimbabwe did not suffer any form of political  intimidation.
    The appellant had no political profile.  It was not accepted  that  S's
    husband had been a local MDC chairman as  S's  asylum  claim  had  been
    found to be a fabrication.  The appellant would therefore  be  able  to
    return safely to Zimbabwe.

33.   On 17 February 2010 the appellant prepared a witness  statement.   She
    maintained that she lives with her daughter, M, who was a  student.   S
    now has indefinite  leave  to  remain  (according  to  the  documentary
    evidence this was granted on 20 March 2008; the basis for this  is  not
    known).  The appellant stated that she discovered that she was infected
    in June 2002 and that she then commenced treatment.   She  stated  that
    two of her sisters in Zimbabwe  had  died  five  years  earlier  in  an
    accident and she did not know whether the other two were alive or  dead
    as they were displaced  and  she  had  lost  contact  with  them.   She
    maintained that M travelled to Zimbabwe in 2009 but had been unable  to
    locate them.  She stated that she is  on  new  medication  as  she  had
    developed a resistance to  her  previous  regimen.   She  is  currently
    taking Raltegravir, Atazanavir, Ritonavir  and  Truvada  (Emtricitabine
    with Tenofovir).  She also suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease
    (GERD) and diabetes.

34.   The appellant's daughter, M, also provided a written statement  on  17
    February 2010.  She confirmed that the appellant lives with her and her
    family, that she (M) works as a nurse and has a work permit valid until
    August 2010, that she will be able to apply  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in May 2010, and that her husband is also  in  employment.   She
    stated that she returned with her husband and children to Zimbabwe  for
    two weeks in  2009  to  attend  her  husband's  grandfather's  memorial
    service.  They stayed in a hotel apart  from  two  days  spent  in  her
    husband's home village when they had to take food and water with  them.
    She confirmed electricity blackouts and sewage  problems.   She  stated
    that she went to look for her maternal aunts in  Mbare  but  could  not
    locate them.  She maintained that she is responsible for  her  mother's
    finance and accommodation and additionally  provides  her  with  �50  a
    week.

35.   The medical evidence submitted in respect of the appellant shows  that
    she has been treated for tuberculosis.  She is making good response  to
    ART.  Different prognoses are made of her life expectancy if  treatment
    were to be stopped.  The letter of  13  August  2002  from  Dr  Stanley
    suggests it would be less than two years; his letter of 9 October  2003
    suggests 3-4 years.  A report from Dr Minton of 9 October  2009  states
    that the appellant is on a daily tablet of Truvada  with  Efavirenz  at
    night.  According to his 11 January 2010 report, the  appellant  has  a
    resistance to the two main classes of  HIV  medication  commonly  used,
    particularly Lamivudine  and  Efavirenz.   Her  regimen  was  therefore
    changed to  a  complex  one  consisting  of  Raltegravir  twice  daily,
    Atazanavir once a day, Ritonavir once a day and Truvada once a day.  At
    her last test on 29 December 2009, her HIV viral load was not  detected
    and her CD4 count was 388.  In his report of 25 February 2010 Dr Minton
    suggests that the only other alternative  available  to  the  appellant
    because of drug resistance would  be  Enfurvitide  which  is  taken  by
    injection and which he did not expect would be available in Zimbabwe.

Case Management Review Hearing

36.   A further Case Management review hearing for all three appellants  was
    held on 19 October 2009.  Following that hearing directions  were  sent
    out by Senior Immigration Judge Lane.  It was noted therein  that  both
    the appellant and respondent took  the  view  that  the  hearings  were
    unsuitable for giving general country guidance (if necessary,  updating
    RN) in relation to returnees to Zimbabwe  who  were  not  HIV-positive.
    The hearings, originally set for 7-9 December 2009 were adjourned owing
    to the unavailability of expert witnesses and re-listed for  1-3  March
    2010 when they came before this Tribunal.

Appeal Hearing

37.   We heard oral evidence from  RS  and  EC  on  the  first  day  of  the
    hearing.  RS gave her evidence in Shona through a court interpreter and
    EC gave evidence in English.

      Evidence of RS

38.   The  appellant  confirmed  that  the  contents  of  her  three  appeal
    statements were true and accurate and adopted  them  as  her  evidence.
    She was then tendered for cross-examination.

39.   In response to questions put by Mr Thomann,  the  appellant  confirmed
    that she had been born in Chigutu and that she had lived in Gokwe since
    1990.  She had a sister and four brothers all of whom lived  in  Gokwe.
    She had two uncles as well.  Her parents had died.  She  was  asked  to
    explain the conflict in her written evidence as  to  which  parent  had
    died first.  She stated that she had made a  mistake  with  the  dates.
    She clarified that she shared the same mother with her sister but  that
    they had different fathers.  She was asked to clarify the reference  to
    stepsisters in the plural in her witness statement;  she  replied  that
    she only had one.  She confirmed that her husband had seven sisters and
    four brothers.  Two of his brothers  had  died  but  the  rest  of  his
    siblings were alive.  Of his seven sisters, M lived in  the  UK  and  P
    lived in the USA.  Her husband had stayed with M when he came to the UK
    and so had she. P used to support her financially  so  that  she  could
    attend college  but  no  longer  did  so.   She  was  referred  to  her
    application form in which she mentioned that  her  sister-in-law  would
    assist her to obtain private treatment.  The appellant stated that  the
    lawyer who helped  her  with  that  application  made  a  mistake  when
    completing the form.  M also assisted  her  with  her  studies  but  no
    longer provided any financial support because she had  her  own  family
    and could not afford it.

40.   The appellant confirmed that her  husband  had  returned  to  Zimbabwe
    following the death of his father as he wanted to  attend  the  funeral
    and pay his respects.  He had family members he wanted to  be  with  at
    the time.  The appellant agreed that funds were sent by her  sister-in-
    law to her mother-in-law in Zimbabwe  but  maintained  that  they  were
    insufficient to help to support the appellant's husband.   Occasionally
    her mother-in-law might assist in supporting the appellant's  children.
    She agreed that her mother-in-law had travelled  abroad  to  visit  her
    daughters but maintained that these were not luxury trips and  she  had
    only been abroad twice.  Her  daughters  had  funded  the  visits.  She
    denied that there were people in  Dema  and  Gokwe  who  were  able  to
    support her in Zimbabwe.  She maintained, in fact, that as she  was  in
    the UK she was expected to help them.   She  agreed  that  if  it  were
    possible, the community provided support generally.

41.   The appellant was referred to  the  determination  of  her  appeal  in
    2002.  She was reminded that she had claimed that her husband  was  not
    politically active or targeted  for  persecution.   Her  attention  was
    drawn to a later statement where she claimed that she  and  her  family
    had always been supporters of the MDC.  She was asked  to  explain  why
    she had not mentioned this in the context of her earlier  human  rights
    claim.  The appellant explained that she  had  been  dealing  with  her
    medical claim the first time and that she raised asylum when  she  made
    her second claim.  She stated she could not remember being asked in the
    context of her first appeal  whether  her  husband  had  any  political
    involvement.

42.   The appellant was asked why she made no mention in her  first  witness
    statement of being detained.  She replied that she had not  been  asked
    about  that.   The  appellant  was  asked  to  explain   the   apparent
    contradiction in her  written  evidence  as  to  the  duration  of  her
    detention in 2000 when she claimed she  was  beaten  with  ropes.   She
    maintained that she had been arrested three times.   She  said  one  of
    those detentions lasted two hours and another was overnight.  She  said
    that she may have mixed up the dates.  She could not recall whether the
    first detention lasted two hours or all night.  She denied that she was
    providing more detail as time went by and explained that  the  accounts
    would be different as one was based on medical reasons and the other on
    asylum.

43.   The appellant was shown a letter dated 14 April  2001  signed  by  the
    Provincial Youth Secretary and the Secretary of the MDC for Chitungwiza
    province.  She explained that she used to attend  youth  meetings  with
    her cousin and so was able to obtain this letter.  She agreed with  the
    contents of the letter which indicated that she  had  been  victimised,
    arrested, tortured, had her home and property destroyed and  was  being
    hunted by ZANU PF so that she had to leave.  She stated, however,  that
    when she arrived here her intention had been to visit.   The  appellant
    was asked why there was no mention of the destruction of her  home  and
    property in any of her other evidence.  She  maintained  that  she  had
    mentioned that the house she had lived in was destroyed.  Reference was
    made to her witness statement in which it is recorded that her brother-
    in-law's house was destroyed in 2004.  She maintained that that was the
    incident she had been referring to and that as she also  lived  in  the
    same house, she considered it as hers as well.  The appellant was asked
    to explain why she had made no  mention  in  her  statements  of  being
    hunted by ZANU PF officials.   She  replied  that  when  she  had  been
    distributing leaflets she had been told that she would be  arrested  if
    caught again.  That is what was meant.  It was put to her that she  had
    only been arrested when selling T-shirts  or  attending  rallies.   She
    denied that, maintaining that it was not only on those  occasions.   It
    was put to the appellant that she had not left Zimbabwe because of  the
    actions of state agents.  She replied that was not true.  The appellant
    was referred to her asylum application form and reminded that  she  had
    been requested to provide full details  for  her  departure.   She  was
    asked to explain why she had maintained at that time that her intention
    had been to visit the UK and why there had been  no  mention  of  being
    hunted by state agents.  The appellant replied that the  situation  had
    deteriorated and she realised she could not return.

44.   The appellant confirmed that her husband remained  in  Zimbabwe.   She
    said he was not politically active because he was ill.  She stated that
    she would be of interest to the authorities because of her asylum claim
    and the length of her residence in the UK.   She  stated  that  at  the
    moment they had no interest in him because he was ill.

45.   The appellant confirmed that Dema was  an  MDC  stronghold.   She  was
    asked why, in those circumstances, there would be any need for  someone
    to target her.  She replied that there were  still  people  around  who
    supported ZANU PF.

46.   The  appellant  confirmed  that  there  were  hospitals  in  Dema  and
    Chitungwiza. She agreed that her children had been born in a  hospital.
    She stated that Chitungwiza was about 40-45 kilometres  from  Dema  and
    that it took about two hours by bus.

47.   The appellant maintained that her case was that she would not  receive
    medical treatment if she returned to Zimbabwe  because  she  could  not
    show support for ZANU PF.  It was put  to  her  that  medical  aid  was
    distributed and controlled by NGOs.  She agreed that could be the  case
    but stated that it had to go through the healthcare  system  and  hence
    the government.  She expressed awareness that the health  minister  was
    with the MDC but stated that they had no control.  It was  put  to  the
    appellant that she had a choice of hospitals to which she could  go  if
    returned to Zimbabwe.  She maintained  that  it  was  not  possible  to
    travel for treatment and gave the example of  being  unable  to  travel
    from Southend to Scotland for treatment.  She maintained  that  if  she
    was unable to receive treatment  from  Dema  Hospital,  she  could  not
    expect to obtain it in Chitungwiza.  She maintained that some hospitals
    in Harare were closed because they had  no  medicine.   That  completed
    cross-examination.

48.   In re-examination the  appellant  stated  that  her  husband  was  not
    receiving any medical treatment and was  very  unwell.   She  explained
    that her first witness statement was made in  support  of  her  medical
    claim, the second in support of her asylum application  and  the  third
    was a consolidated statement for this appeal.  She  stated  that  there
    was nobody who would be able to provide her with financial  support  in
    Zimbabwe.  She was asked about the cost of travelling  from  Harare  to
    Dema.  She replied that she no longer knew what it would  cost  as  she
    had been away for such a long time.  That completed re-examination.

49.   In response to questions from the bench, the appellant confirmed  that
    her husband had not received any treatment since returning to Zimbabwe.
     She was asked to explain what had prompted her asylum  application  in
    2006.  She replied that when she thought about  the  beatings  she  had
    experienced and saw the news she was fearful of returning.  She  stated
    that her husband had returned to Zimbabwe in 2002.  He had been able to
    grow vegetables for the first few years as he still  had  "medicine  in
    his system".  In 2006 or 2007 his sister began to help  him.   When  he
    left the UK he had a student visa but it expired during the time he was
    in Zimbabwe.  He had no problems on his return  because  of  his  visa.
    She explained that she had not realised that she  could  make  a  joint
    claim on asylum and medical grounds; additionally she had  thought  the
    situation  in  Zimbabwe  would  improve.   With  regard  to  her  third
    detention, she stated it was during the day.  She was  ill  treated  on
    all three occasions.

      Evidence of EC

50.   This appellant gave evidence in English.  She too  adopted  her  three
    witness statements and was tendered for cross-examination.

51.   She confirmed that she had arrived in the  UK  in  December  2001  and
    that she had met the costs of the ticket herself.  She had worked as  a
    secretary.  She came to visit her uncle who worked in the Zimbabwe High
    Commission in London.  She did not know whether he had  been  appointed
    by the government.  She had stayed with him when she came here  and  he
    provided her with financial  support.   She  maintained  that  she  had
    completed the application form of June  2002  herself.   She  said  her
    uncle assisted her with the student application.  He  had  returned  to
    Zimbabwe in 2005.  They were no longer in touch.  He  had  retired  and
    gone to his village.  She had not really tried to make contact with him
    but had a cousin in Harare who was his niece and whom she could contact
    about him.

52.   The appellant stated that she had a sister in Zimbabwe  who  lived  in
    Chivu with her family.  Her relatives received  maize  from  a  distant
    cousin who was involved with farming.  She  stated  that  she  had  two
    children who were both studying and were supported  by  their  paternal
    grandmother ever since their father had died.  She confirmed  that  she
    attended church in the UK but there was nobody there who would be  able
    to assist her.  She stated that she used to live with a cousin but  now
    lived with a friend from church.

53.   In re-examination the appellant stated that her sister was a widow.

      Evidence of Professor Barnett

54.   Professor Anthony Spencer Barnett gave  his  professional  address  as
    the London School of Economics on Houghton Street.  He  confirmed  that
    he had prepared two reports and that he understood  his  duties  as  an
    expert.  He confirmed that the  reports  were  true  and  continued  to
    reflect his view although he had two amendments to make.  The first was
    with regard to the availability of antiretroviral drugs in the  private
    sector.  Although he maintained in his  report  that  such  drugs  were
    available he had discovered by way of a telephone conversation made  on
    18 February 2010 that in most cases such medication was not  available.
    The second amendment was that he was no  longer  certain  that  medical
    staff were on strike as funds had now been made available to them.   He
    stated that he had first travelled to Africa as a volunteer when he was
    17 years old.  He had trained in social  sciences  to  PhD  level.   He
    developed an interest in AIDS in 1986 and had  continued  his  work  in
    infectious diseases since that time.

55.   Professor Barnett explained that the National AIDS Council was set  up
    by President Mugabe in 2003 with a view to distributing funds  obtained
    through  an  AIDS  levy  providing  care  and  treatment;  a   detailed
    description was provided in the report prepared for EC.  The  Chair  of
    the Board was appointed by the President and although the former  could
    then select members,  the  President  could  impose  his  will  in  the
    selection process and  could  appoint  individuals  who  had  not  been
    recommended by the  Committee.   Appointees  were  likely  to  toe  the
    political line.  Further, the situation at national level had a  direct
    influence on what happened at village level.  The  structure  was  such
    that the wards charged with co-ordinating activity as regards treatment
    and care at ground level, were influenced by the line taken at national
    level.

56.   Professor Barnett was asked whether there were any constraints on  the
    co-operation of NGOs in Zimbabwe.   He  replied  that  one  should  not
    assume that international organisations had the best information.   For
    example, the World Health Organisation (WHO) worked  on  the  basis  of
    reports from the field and sometimes that evidence was  anecdotal.   He
    stated that when he  had  contact  with  the  Red  Cross  recently,  he
    received different responses from staff in Zimbabwe as opposed to those
    in South Africa.  His informed guess was that  this  was  because  such
    organisations were concerned about their own existence and  constrained
    by the niceties of diplomacy.  He said that his  own  information  came
    from a variety of sources ranging from people on the street to heads of
    organisations.

57.   Professor Barnett stated that the Global Fund, based  in  Switzerland,
    raised money to distribute throughout the world  with  the  purpose  of
    combating killer diseases.  It found  that  a  large  amount  of  money
    allocated to Zimbabwe  had  been  misappropriated  by  the  government.
    Although the funds were repaid after international pressure, they  were
    now channelled through the UN Development Programme (UNDP) rather  than
    the Bank of Zimbabwe.  The Global Fund was a major donor of funds  used
    to purchase antiretroviral drugs.  It also provided drugs  and  trained
    staff.  Although there  was  some  procurement  of  drugs  through  the
    government program, most came from the Fund.

58.   With respect to the evidence from  the  respondent  regarding  waiting
    lists, Professor Barnett stated that he understood waiting time  to  be
    longer than six months and indeed likely to be up to a  year  depending
    on what kind of treatment was sought.  If it was first line  treatment,
    then six to twelve months was reasonable.  It depended on  one's  place
    of residence as well.  If second line treatment  was  sought  then  the
    wait could be longer.  He was asked whether  people  already  receiving
    treatment were prioritised for the purpose of obtaining medication.  He
    stated he found this question difficult to answer.  He had discussed it
    with "someone who should know" but they did not know.  He had looked at
    the WHO position and although they confirmed there was  such  priority,
    he was not convinced that  this  happened  as  no  mechanism  for  that
    priority to operate existed.

59.   Professor Barnett confirmed that  he  had  made  recent  enquiries  of
    pharmacists in the private sector in Zimbabwe about the availability of
    drugs taken by  the  appellants.   He  had  spoken  to  someone  called
    Benjamin at the  Cameron  Pharmacy  and  to  someone  called  Tenda  at
    Avondale Pharmacy.  He had enquired as to whether the medication  could
    be obtained within the next two or three days and he had  received  the
    following information.  RS's medication of Tenofovir was not available,
    Zidovudine was available, and Efavirenz was available at  one  pharmacy
    but not at the other.  EC took Atripla which was a combination of three
    drugs: Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir. Efavirenz was  available
    but the other two were not.  For BR, Atazanir,  Truvada  and  Ritonavir
    were not available. Raltegravir was a newly introduced drug  which  was
    extremely expensive and not available anywhere in Africa  according  to
    his enquiries.  He confirmed  that  the  cost  of  medication  had  not
    altered significantly since the preparation of his report.

60.   Professor Barnett was asked for his view on whether political  support
    affected the distribution of medication.   He  indicated  that  in  the
    March 2008 elections, 52.5% had voted for the MDC and  47.5%  for  ZANU
    PF.  One would therefore expect  to  see  a  50-50  distribution.   The
    evidence from the respondent, however, indicated  that  the  ratio  was
    somewhat higher in provinces that voted in favour of ZANU PF,  such  as
    Central Province, Mashonaland East and West.

61.   He confirmed that he had read the report prepared by Dr Naomi  Mujuru-
    Mvere and that he agreed with what she had said about  local  political
    control over the processes by which people get to see doctors  or  NGOs
    and about the unhealthy nature of life in Zimbabwe.

62.   Professor Barnett was then asked about the oral evidence  of  RS  with
    respect to the claimed destruction of her home.  He stated that he  had
    studied the anthropology of this area many years ago and  that  it  was
    common for land and property to be jointly owned by a group or lineage.
     Therefore although the appellant described the property as being owned
    by her uncle (sic), it would have been owned  by  the  entire  lineage.
    That completed his examination in chief.

63.   Professor Barnett was then cross-examined by Ms  Grey.   He  confirmed
    that the Global Fund targeted remote regions of Zimbabwe.  It  was  put
    to him, that in those circumstances, to suggest the  imbalance  between
    the distribution of medical treatment between MDC and ZANU PF areas was
    due to political allegiance was an unsophisticated method  of  analysis
    given that  the  criterion  for  funding  was  the  remoteness  of  the
    district.  Professor Barnett stood by his analysis.  He maintained that
    there was an imbalance of aid and that he  had  considered  voting  and
    population density.

64.    Professor  Barnett  agreed  that  his  evidence  was  obtained   from
    discussions with people and visits made to South Africa.  He  confirmed
    that he had not been in Zimbabwe since the  year  2000.   He  had  some
    important contacts, someone who spoke directly with the  president  but
    whose  identity  he  could  not  reveal,  and  officials   working   in
    international agencies, NGOs in Zimbabwe and personal friends.  He also
    met with Zimbabweans in South Africa, both professionals and  refugees,
    and he met Zimbabweans in the UK.

65.   He agreed that he had no medical qualifications  but  anyone  who  had
    worked in the AIDS field for as long as he had done, was aware that  if
    a patient's CD4 count dropped below 250, there was a  greater  risk  of
    opportunistic infections, particularly if they had been suffered in the
    past.  When it was put to him that Dr Day did not suggest in his report
    that EC was  at  an  elevated  risk  of  ill  health  because  she  had
    contracted opportunistic infections in the past, he contended  that  Ms
    Grey had no understanding of an AIDS diagnosis.  He explained  that  in
    many African countries people had witnessed friends and relatives dying
    of AIDS and had a good understanding of what conditions such as candida
    and dermatitis could lead to.

66.   Professor Barnett agreed that at the time he prepared his report,  the
    drugs were available.  He had used the same definition of  availability
    at that time as he did now.  He did not make enquiries about any  other
    drugs that might be available.  He also made  no  enquiries  about  the
    availability of drugs during  a  different  timescale.   He  explained,
    however, that his evidence showed the volatility of supply.  He had  no
    doubt that some drugs might be available today, however the  point  was
    that someone seeking treatment could not be sure that they would always
    be available.  He confirmed he had had a single conversation with  each
    pharmacist on 18 February 2010.  The information based  on  his  report
    regarding the  availability  of  drugs  was  also  based  on  a  single
    conversation.  He accepted that  the  respondent's  evidence  indicated
    that on 11 February 2010 Truvada was available.  He confirmed  that  he
    had no disagreement with the cost analysis set out by  the  respondent.
    With respect to the new drug taken by BR, he indicated  that  it  could
    not be imported to Zimbabwe as it had not been approved for importation
    as yet.  He agreed that he had not specifically  made  enquiries  about
    the drug and its licence, but he had been told it was not available  in
    Africa.  He questioned the  definition  of  availability  used  by  the
    Ministry  of  Health  in  the  documentary  evidence  provided  by  the
    respondent.  He stated he had  no  doubt  that  these  drugs  would  be
    obtained but he did not know what 'available' meant.  He agreed that by
    a volatile supply, he meant that drugs were available erratically.   He
    agreed it would be reasonable to assume that whilst some drugs may  not
    be available in some pharmacies in Harare, they could be  available  in
    others.  He stated, however, that one could not be sure.

67.   Professor Barnett was asked whether it was  fair  to  say  that  there
    were some improvements in the economic situation.  He agreed that there
    was  improvement  but  pointed  out  that  it  was  uneven.    Although
    businesses had picked up and salaries were being  paid,  there  was  no
    improvement for those who were unemployed, and  four  or  five  million
    were dependent on food aid.  He agreed that  wages  were  now  paid  to
    public sector employees and that they had increased from $100  a  month
    to $150 a month.

68.   Professor Barnett maintained that food distribution was restricted  to
    supporters  of  ZANU  PF.   Although  he  acknowledged  that  the  food
    programme was under the control of international agencies and NGOs, and
    therefore contrasted with the situation in 2008, he  stated  that  food
    had to be distributed through the local structure  and  that  was  when
    political influence came to bear.  He stated that a document from local
    administration was needed to obtain a supply of food.  Sometimes, party
    allegiances and interpersonal relationships impacted on the ability  to
    obtain such authorisation.  Professor Barnett was asked to explain  how
    that  meshed  with  his  claim  in  his  report  that   NGOs   operated
    effectively.  He indicated that was not what he meant. He  stated  that
    there was less bias in the urban areas.  It was  put  to  him  that  EC
    would be returning to Harare and so  would  be  unlikely  to  face  any
    substantial bias regarding food aid.  He agreed that was  a  reasonable
    conclusion if vouchers were to be  relied  on.   With  regard  to  BR's
    return to Chitungwiza, he replied that he  had  never  been  there  and
    could not help.  It was pointed out that Chitungwiza was  an  MDC  seat
    and that there would be people willing to identify  supporters  of  the
    MDC for the purposes of obtaining an authorisation  document  for  food
    aid.  He replied that may be the case but one could not  be  sure  that
    the town hall or village council had altered its complexion and it  may
    be that the administration or local  authority  was  different  to  the
    political seat of the area.  As to whether it was reasonable to  assume
    that there would  be  an  MDC  MP  or  someone  else  to  turn  to  for
    assistance, he was unable to say.

69.   Reference was made to the comment of the Minister of  Agriculture  who
    threatened to ban NGOs.  The point was  made  that  this  had  not  yet
    happened. Professor Barnett agreed but stated  that  it  indicated  the
    kind of environment in which NGOs were operating.  By threatening their
    work, the minister was moderating what they had to say.  He agreed that
    nevertheless NGOs had to show transparency and effectiveness  in  their
    work if they were to maintain international integrity.  He agreed  that
    that might justify an employee's reluctance to identify himself.

70.   Ms Grey suggested that there was little reason to suppose  that  those
    operating in health centres necessarily  had  political  allegiance  to
    ZANU PF.  Professor Barnett disagreed and stated that the  further  out
    one went in the structure, the more likely it was that one  would  find
    ZANU PF supporters, whereas those closer  to  the  Minister  were  more
    likely to be from the MDC.  He  said  there  was  no  conflict  between
    individuals supporting President Mugabe but striking because  they  had
    not been paid.  When it was put to him again that  there  was  no  real
    evidence that health workers favoured ZANU PF supporters over  the  MDC
    when it came to access for treatment,  Professor  Barnett  stated  that
    people working in the Town Hall may be fossils of the old  regime.   He
    described the situation as being akin  to  Belfast  in  1987  when  the
    Catholics complained about discrimination.   He  agreed  that  about  a
    third of those requiring treatment were now receiving it and  that  the
    situation was probably improving but he maintained that  the  estimates
    of the Global Fund were based on a mathematical model and one  did  not
    know the reality of the situation.  He also wondered  how  the  figures
    provided by the Ministry of Health had been compiled.

71.    It  was  put  to  Professor  Barnett  that  his  objections  to   the
    prioritisation of patients already on ART appeared to be based  on  the
    lack of information he had about how that could  operate  and  that  he
    could not therefore say with any certainty that  the  information  from
    the respondent was not true.  Professor Barnett replied that if he  was
    not in a position to know, neither was the Secretary of State.

72.   He agreed that the funds misused by the government  were  returned  to
    the Global Fund following international pressure and that the UNDP  had
    taken  over  control  of  distribution  but  he  maintained  that   the
    government could not be trusted and that it would not  take  kindly  to
    having part of its economic system re-colonised.

73.   Professor Barnett was referred to a claim in his report that  supplies
    of available drugs may be diverted by ZANU PF personnel.  He  confirmed
    that the source of that claim was  information  from  people  in  South
    Africa and also from Zimbabweans in the UK and some news  reports.   He
    maintained that medical personnel were stealing and selling  drugs  and
    that radio stations and the press  were  inflaming  feelings.   It  was
    pointed out to him that he had  maintained  in  his  report  that  such
    incidents occurred in rural areas and therefore did not  apply  to  the
    situation of the appellants.  He disagreed.  He stated that such events
    also happened in urban areas.  When asked  for  evidence  of  that,  he
    stated that he had received such reports from people.  It  was  pointed
    out to him that in his report he had repeatedly referred only to  rural
    areas.  He replied that that did not mean it did not  happen  in  urban
    areas.

74.   Professor Barnett agreed that many Zimbabweans had fled their  country
    for economic reasons.  He was asked why they should not be  assumed  to
    be economic migrants on return.   He  stated  that  the  Mugabe  regime
    thought of those who fled as traitors and opponents of the regime.   He
    agreed he had little independent knowledge or expertise on the issue of
    political violence.  That completed cross-examination.

75.   In re-examination Professor Barnett confirmed  that  he  had  attended
    AIDS conferences, had written a book on the subject, had  contact  with
    leading scientists and had studied the science of HIV.  He agreed  that
    he did not have knowledge on other aspects of medicine.   He  confirmed
    that about 40% of opportunistic infections in Africa were  tuberculosis
    cases.  He explained that if medication were to be  interrupted,  there
    would be an explosion of resistant strains of the  virus.   This  would
    happen if a patient missed more than two days a month.  However,  if  a
    longer period of medication were to be missed, then the  patient  could
    return to the situation he was in when he  first  commenced  treatment.
    He stated that Efavirenz was not suitable for those of African heritage
    as they became really ill and that when it was taken here,  they  could
    be supervised.  He  pointed  out  that  in  the  information  from  the
    Ministry of Health, there was an attempt to maintain that CD4  counting
    machines were not needed.   With  regard  to  NGOs,  Professor  Barnett
    stated that they walked a fine line;  balancing  threats  by  ministers
    with the need to provide a service to the society in which they worked.



76.   In reply to questions from  the  bench,  Professor  Barnett  explained
    that it would take between four and six weeks for drugs  to  leave  the
    patient's system if  medication  were  to  be  stopped.   He  expressed
    surprise at the fact that RS's husband was still alive.  He agreed that
    it was possible that some of the  informants  he  obtained  information
    from may have their own agenda.  He stated that  he  did  not  ask  for
    their political allegiance and they may be critics of the government.

77.   He confirmed in response to a question then put by Ms  Monaghan,  that
    the existence of an agenda on the part of his informants did not impact
    on his judgement.  He stated that he asked questions about the  sources
    of their information.

Evidence of Andrew Jones

78.   The last witness we heard from was Andrew Jones, First  Secretary  for
    Migration at the British Embassy in Harare, called as a witness by  the
    respondent.  Mr Jones gave oral evidence via video  link  from  Harare.
    He confirmed he had responsibility for policy issues  in  Zimbabwe  and
    South Africa and that he had prepared two reports,  both  of  which  he
    relied upon.  He agreed that he had no direct involvement in the health
    care system in Zimbabwe.  He confirmed that all  the  interviews  which
    had been summarised in his report were conducted in person  except  for
    one which was carried out by e-mail.  He then collated the  information
    which was agreed with his informants and prepared his report.   He  had
    selected his sources as being those whom he  assessed  to  be  able  to
    provide the most information.  He confirmed that four organisations did
    not want their identity or the name of the informant  to  be  released.
    He confirmed that the contents of his report were true to the  best  of
    his belief.  He confirmed that he had visited  the  Avenues  Clinic  in
    Harare.  He had been taken to the store room and was shown the stock of
    medication.  He stated that it was possible to  obtain  a  fairly  wide
    variety of  drugs  through  the  private  system.   One  could  take  a
    prescription to any pharmacy.   Some  drugs  were  ordered  from  South
    Africa but he was not aware of the timescale involved.

79.   Mr Jones confirmed that  with  respect  to  his  second  report  which
    provided a response to Dr Kibble's report, he obtained information from
    other Embassy colleagues.

80.   He was asked about a report that  the  Minister  for  Agriculture  had
    banned NGOs from distributing food aid.  He replied  that  the  embassy
    had received no reports that food aid had been banned and there was  no
    information forthcoming from NGOs to confirm that  this  had  happened.
    He also had no information that a Food  for  Work  Programme  had  been
    introduced.

81.   Mr Jones was then cross-examined by Ms Monaghan.   He  explained  that
    the terms of reference for his reports had been set in  agreement  with
    the UK Border Agency, Country of Origin  Information  Service  and  the
    Asylum Team.   He  confirmed  that  he  had  selected  individuals  for
    questioning.  He had  been  pointed  in  the  right  direction  by  his
    colleagues.   Further,  some  individuals  he   had   interviewed   had
    recommended others.  If more time had been available, there would  have
    been more interviews.  He agreed that the list of  questions  had  been
    attached  to  the  report.   The  same  questions  were  put   to   all
    interviewees but fewer were put to the  individual  interviewed  by  e-
    mail.  He confirmed that his report had been prepared as  a  result  of
    reliance on the responses he had  received.   He  agreed  that  he  had
    prepared notes rather than a verbatim  transcript.   After  summarising
    the replies, he read them to his informants so that any  amendments  or
    additions could be  made.   He  did  not  seek  to  filter  information
    deliberately.  He confirmed that the individual he interviewed  at  the
    WHO did not want her identity to be disclosed.  He did not ask why  and
    guessed that this might be for a variety  of  reasons.   He  could  not
    speculate on what they might be.  He agreed that one of the replies had
    been that not every facility had a CD4 counting machine available.   He
    had not sought to check that information against other informants.   It
    was pointed out to him that this information and information about long
    waiting lists and the politicisation of access  to  ART  had  not  been
    mentioned in his report.  He replied that he was unable to confirm this
    immediately but accepted that this was possible.  He confirmed it would
    probably just have been an  oversight.   He  stated  that  he  had  not
    included the identity of the individual from  the  Ministry  of  Health
    because he had not been given permission to use that individual's name.
     He had asked but had not yet received a response.

82.   With respect to the interview conducted with the  Ministry  of  Health
    official, he explained that questions were asked but he  then  realised
    that the full list of questions had not been put so he  then  contacted
    the individual by e-mail but had not yet received  a  response  to  the
    other questions.  He had made two attempts to obtain  the  information,
    once was before Christmas and the second time was in January.

83.   Mr Jones confirmed that where no answer was recorded in an  interview,
    that meant that the respondee had declined to answer the question.   He
    was asked why certain sentences had been redacted.  He replied  it  was
    because they would have given an indication  of  the  identity  of  the
    interviewee.

84.   Mr Jones agreed that the only people he interviewed were in  Zimbabwe.
     With regard to his conclusions he accepted that not  all  interviewees
    had been asked the question about withholding drugs  and  therefore  it
    was not right to say that no issues about that  had  been  raised.   He
    agreed that the issue of stigma had not been  explored.   He  confirmed
    that documents had been attached to his report  and  that  he  did  not
    undertake extensive research.  He agreed, with  regard  to  his  second
    report, that he was not  in  a  position  to  comment  on  whether  the
    observations and responses made by others to Dr  Kibble  and  Professor
    Ranger's reports were valid.  He  confirmed  that  he  had  chosen  the
    extracts from the DfID report that pertained to  HIV.   That  concluded
    his evidence.

Submissions

The Respondent's Submissions


85.    Ms  Grey  submitted  that  the  appellants'  claims  based  upon  the
    consequences of being returned to Zimbabwe as people  living  with  HIV
    and AIDS had to be seen in the context of the fact that there are about
    1.1 million people living with HIV and AIDS in Zimbabwe,  an  estimated
    13.7% of the population: Ministry of Health and Child Welfare Data  for
    November 2009, RBA 27.  The problems arising in this context  had  been
    identified by Sedley LJ in ZT v SSHD [2005]  EWCA  Civ  1421.   He  had
    referred to the need to set the bar for removal under  both  Article  3
    and Article 8 cases  unusually  high  in  cases  involving  AIDS.   She
    referred to the opinions given by the House of Lords in N v SSHD [2005]
    UKHL 31 and in particular to the comment of Lord Hope at  paragraph  48
    that:

        "...aliens who are subject to expulsion cannot in  principle  claim
        any entitlement to remain in the territory of a  contracting  State
        in order to continue to benefit from medical, social or other forms
        of assistance provided by the expelling State.  For an exception to
        be  made  where  expulsion  is  resisted  on  medical  grounds  the
        circumstances must be exceptional... subsequent  cases  have  shown
        that D v United Kingdom is taken as the paradigm case as to what is
        meant by the formula."

86.   Lord Brown had summarised the threshold  requirement  saying  that  it
    must be shown that an appellant's medical condition had reached such  a
    critical stage that there were compelling humanitarian grounds for  not
    removing him or her to a place which lacked medical and social services
    which would be needed to prevent acute suffering while he  or  she  was
    dying.

87.   Ms Grey submitted that  the  following  propositions  which  could  be
    derived from the ECHR's jurisprudence on the application of  Article  3
    as follows:

    (a)     The guarantees in Article 3 apply when an individual is at risk
        of being subjected to any of the proscribed forms of treatment as a
        result of intentionally inflicted acts of the public authorities in
        the receiving country.


    (b)     The jurisprudence allows sufficient flexibility to address  the
        application of Article 3 in other contexts including  the  risk  of
        proscribed treatment in the receiving country stemming from factors
        which  would  not  engage  either  directly   or   indirectly   the
        responsibility of the public authorities or which when taken  alone
        would not infringe Article 3 standards.


    (c)     The types of inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  falling  within
        Article 3 must attain a  minimum  level  of  severity  and  involve
        actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering.


    (d)     Treatment is "degrading" when it is such as to  arouse  in  the
        victims feelings  of  fear,  anguish  and  inferiority  capable  of
        humiliating and debasing them.  It must be considered whether  this
        is its object and whether so far as the consequences are  concerned
        such treatment adversely affects his or her personality in a manner
        incompatible with Article 3 but the absence  of  any  such  purpose
        cannot conclusively rule out a finding of violation of Article 3.


88.   In the case of D, described as the paradigm case  for  the  assessment
    of a breach of Article 3 on the basis of lack of medical support in the
    receiving State, the appellant was in the advanced stages of a terminal
    and incurable illness and the abrupt  withdrawal  of  facilities  which
    permitted a limited quality of life to be enjoyed would  have  dramatic
    consequences on him and there was a serious danger that the  conditions
    of adversity awaiting him in St Kitts would have subjected him to acute
    mental and physical suffering.  There had been  no  evidence  that  the
    sole relative resident in St Kitts was willing to attend to  his  needs
    nor was there any form of moral or social  support,  and  the  lack  of
    shelter and  proper  diet  would  expose  him  to  further  health  and
    sanitation problems and the UK had assumed responsibility for  treating
    him between 1994 and 1997.

89.   Ms Grey pointed out that in the twelve years between D v UK  and  N  v
    UK, the ECHR had not again found that a proposed removal  of  an  alien
    would give rise  to  a  violation  of  Article  3  on  grounds  of  the
    applicant's ill-health.  The ECHR had revisited the  issue  of  medical
    treatment in N v United Kingdom (Application no. 26565/05) and had held
    that Article 3 did not impose an obligation  to  alleviate  disparities
    between the level of medical care available through  the  provision  of
    free and unlimited healthcare to all aliens without  a  right  to  stay
    within its jurisdiction.  It was insufficient to demonstrate  a  breach
    of Article  3  that  an  applicant's  quality  of  life  and  his  life
    expectancy would be significantly reduced on removal.  Article 3 issues
    arose only in very exceptional cases in  the  context  of  removing  an
    alien who was suffering from a serious mental or physical illness to  a
    country where facilities for  treatment  were  inferior  and  the  high
    threshold set by D should be maintained  although  there  may  well  be
    other very exceptional cases where the humanitarian considerations were
    equally compelling.   The  determination  in  FH  (HIV/AIDS  -  medical
    facilities) Sierra Leone CG [2002]  UKIAT  0390  had  foreshadowed  the
    subsequent views of the House of Lords but, even if little  by  way  of
    medical care would be available to an applicant on return, the  Article
    3 threshold  would  not  be  crossed  by  returning  a  currently  well
    appellant not in the terminal stages of her illness.

90.   Ms Grey argued that there was no authority for  the  proposition  that
    the allocation of finite resources engaged Article 3 in the absence  of
    an intention thereby to cause  harm.   She  accepted  that  intentional
    deprivation of resources might lead to a breach of Article 3: Cyprus  v
    Turkey (Application no. 25781/94) [2002] 35 EHRR 30.  In ZT  the  Court
    of Appeal had confirmed that in the context of health cases  the  rules
    laid  down  in  N  included  a  specific  requirement  of   exceptional
    circumstances and did not include a special subcategory turning on  the
    behaviour of the receiving State but it was a matter of weight for  the
    Tribunal to assess any such behaviour in a  particular  case.   Nothing
    had  been  put  before  the  Tribunal  to  suggest  that  any  detailed
    examination of the behaviour of the Zimbabwean Government was required.
     Dyson LJ had said in ZT that  he  could  envisage  a  case  where  the
    particular treatment afforded to an AIDS sufferer on return in terms of
    ostracism,  humiliation,  or  deprivation  of  basic  rights  added  to
    existing medical difficulties could create an exceptional case  in  the
    terms of the  guidance  given  by  the  House  of  Lords  but  no  such
    circumstances were established in the present appeals.

91.   Ms Grey referred to the evidence considered in  RN  of  discriminatory
    exclusion and access  to  food  aid  and  whether  it  was  capable  of
    amounting to persecution.  There would need to be a careful examination
    of whether such deliberately discriminatory  actions  had  had  a  real
    effect on the situation of any particular potential beneficiary and had
    led to a situation where a benefit was  not  received  which  otherwise
    would have been received.  It  was  not  enough  simply  to  show  some
    discrimination  or  skewing  of  what  in  any  event  were  inadequate
    resources without also showing that the particular appellant  would  be
    adversely affected as a result.

92.   In so far  as  it  was  argued  that  discriminatory  access  to  food
    supplies or medical treatment amounted to persecution and was  said  to
    be as a result of the appellants' status as  MDC  supporters  or  their
    inability to demonstrate active support for ZANU-PF,  lack  of  medical
    treatment or food due to insufficiency of resources would not give rise
    to a Convention breach.  It would need to be shown  that  there  was  a
    deliberate withholding of food or medical treatment  which  would  have
    been available absent the activities of the State authorities.

93.   She referred to the respondent's IDI  of  March  2004  which  accepted
    that Article 3 could be engaged in health cases: however, this guidance
    had been withdrawn and replaced by an IDI dated February 2007 providing
    simply that claims based on a medical condition should be considered in
    accordance with the House of Lords judgment in N.  She  submitted  that
    this was accessible, clear guidance and was in accordance with the law.
     It carried no reasonable suggestion that applicants might  be  allowed
    to stay outside the exceptional situation meeting the D v UK  criteria.
    There was no case law to establish a proposition  that  the  respondent
    must have a policy setting out in detail how she proposed  to  exercise
    every aspect of the discretion she possessed.

94.   In so far as the appellants sought to  base  a  separate  claim  under
    Article  8,  there  was  no  basis  for  lowering  the  threshold   for
    exceptional cases based on medical treatment.  The Court of Appeal  had
    accepted in JA (Ivory Coast) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 1353 that there was
    a material distinction in the context of an Article 8 claim between  an
    illegal entrant who contrived to remain and the  lawful  entrant  whose
    leave had expired  but  there  was  still  only  limited  room  for  an
    independent consideration of  Article  8  in  cases  involving  medical
    treatment.  In JA the Court of Appeal had accepted  that  an  appellant
    who was a continuously lawful entrant with a history of  leave  granted
    for compassionate reasons, did  not  need  to  demonstrate  exceptional
    circumstances as compelling as those in D but by implication those  who
    had never have been granted compassionate leave to remain for treatment
    or without any expectation of staying beyond their specific  period  of
    leave would be obliged to meet the exceptionality standard.  In summary
    there was no basis to consider under Article 8 issues not already fully
    considered under Article 3 or to reach a different  conclusion  on  the
    lawfulness of removal.  She submitted that none of the three appellants
    had established an adequate factual basis to show that removal would be
    disproportionate.

95.   The appellants were seeking  to  argue  that  the  decisions  violated
    Article 14.  It was accepted in Thlimmenos v Greece [2001] 31  EHRR  14
    that discrimination might arise either because  analogous  groups  were
    treated differently or where States without an objective and reasonable
    justification failed to treat differently persons whose situations were
    significantly different, but the appellants failed to address the issue
    of the comparators.   It  was  argued  that  as  disabled  people,  HIV
    sufferers or as women, they should be treated differently  from  others
    who were removed or deported from the UK on the basis that  they  would
    suffer worse consequences than those others and so  an  adjustment  was
    needed.  Ms  Grey  submitted  that  this  was  an  impermissibly  broad
    comparison.  It was not possible to single out one factor (e.g.  access
    to medical treatment) to claim that this created a group which could be
    compared to all others subject to removal  who  did  not  face  medical
    issues or gender disadvantage.  No sensible comparisons could be drawn.
     Such an argument misstated the nature of the  decision-making  process
    in respect of removal.  It was  subject  to  individual  consideration.
    For the purpose of a claim under Article 14 it had to be  assumed  that
    that process led to a lawful conclusion  that  removal  was  justified,
    otherwise Article  8  alone  could  have  been  relied  on.   In  these
    circumstances Article  14  added  nothing.   If  the  interference  was
    permissible or justified under Article 8 it could not be said that  the
    State had without an objective and reasonable justification  failed  to
    give proper treatment to the appellants.  This was simply an attempt to
    re-state an Article 8 claim which should be rejected if  the  threshold
    under Article 3 could not be met.  The appellants referred  to  the  UN
    Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,  adopted  on  13
    December 2006, a Convention which had not been signed  or  ratified  by
    Zimbabwe.  It was not shown how or by what means the  respondent  might
    be said to have assumed a legal obligation not to remove a person to  a
    State failing to meet such international obligations.

96.   Ms Grey then turned to her submissions on  the  evidence  relating  to
    availability of treatment for AIDS in the public  sector  in  Zimbabwe.
    The evidence showed increasing access to treatment  within  the  public
    sector. The government of Zimbabwe had adopted a national  AIDS  policy
    in 1999 and ART treatment became available in the public sector at four
    health centres in 2004.  About 6,000 people were then estimated to have
    access to such treatment but by the end of 2006 it was  estimated  that
    between 23,000 and 40,000 were receiving treatment.  By  December  2007
    104,000 Zimbabweans had access to ART, a figure rising  to  205,000  in
    January 2009.  It was acknowledged that ART treatment did not currently
    reach all Zimbabweans who needed it and that there  was  a  real  unmet
    need  but  the  evidence  of  the  level  of  coverage  represented   a
    significant improvement.

97.   The total number  of  Zimbabweans  estimated  to  require  ART  varied
    between figures of 300,000  and  350,000  although  in  June  2009  the
    Ministry of Health and Child Welfare assessed the  number  at  500,000.
    Waiting lists for treatment in the public sector were said by Professor
    Barnett to span up to a year and by the WHO up to  six  months.   These
    assessments were not of direct relevance to these appeals as there  was
    evidence that returnees already on ART would be prioritised  and  could
    expect to receive treatment within two weeks and in  any  event  in  no
    more than a month.   In  these  circumstances  there  must  be  a  real
    probability that the  appellants  would  be  able  to  access  priority
    treatment in the public health sector.

98.   The supply of drugs appeared to be independent of economic  issues  in
    Zimbabwe as 90% of the drugs used for ART were supplied and imported by
    NGOs and international  aid  sources.   A  number  of  NGOs  and  other
    organisations assisted the government in distribution  to  clinics  and
    treatment  centres.   There  was  evidence  that  most  people  treated
    privately were reported to have opted to move to the public  sector  by
    the end of 2008 as a result of private  treatment  costs  but  also  as
    public care had become a more viable option.  The evidence did not bear
    out Professor Barnett's conclusion that public treatment would  not  be
    available for the appellants EC and RS.  Treatment would  be  available
    for BR even if Raltegravir was not available.  Ms Grey also argued that
    support would be available for  the  appellants  from  family  members.
    This again made it unlikely that the D threshold would be crossed.  The
    evidence did not establish that  there  was  a  shortage  of  drugs  in
    private pharmacies.  The availability of  private  treatment  therefore
    provided an additional safeguard for returnees able to access  overseas
    remittances or who received resettlement funding.  If  Raltegravir  was
    not available it still did not mean that Article 3  would  be  engaged.
    There was  no  general  entitlement  to  continue  to  benefit  from  a
    particular form of treatment where an applicant had been able  to  have
    access to sophisticated treatment available within this country.

99.   She argued that there was no adequate  evidence  to  show  that  there
    were  distortions  in  access  to  treatment  which  would  affect  the
    appellants.  There had been a misuse  of  donor  funds  but  the  funds
    diverted by the Government of Zimbabwe were returned following  threats
    by the Global Fund to withhold future funding.  In 2009 the Global Fund
    decided to  bypass  the  National  AIDS  Council  in  Zimbabwe  as  the
    principal recipient of existing and future grants choosing  instead  to
    channel money through the UN Development Programme.  This paved the way
    for the country to receive a grant of $37.9  million  in  August  2009.
    Even if this constituted a re-colonisation of a part of the  Zimbabwean
    economy as Professor Barnett suggested, it did not have any bearing  on
    the appellants' claims.  There  was  anecdotal  evidence  of  political
    corruption, government officials being provided with priority access to
    ARVs and there was a further allegation in 2007 that senior  government
    and ZANU-PF officials sold ARV drugs from government hospitals  on  the
    black market.  However, this would not support a finding of  widespread
    political corruption.

100.  The evidence showed that ARVs were procured by NGOs and  international
    organisations with no control being exercised by ZANU-PF.  The  current
    Health Minister was an MDC member and  there  were  no  allegations  of
    corruption against him.  There was no intrinsic evidence to  show  that
    medical staff who handled the distribution of ARVs  were  intrinsically
    loyal to ZANU-PF.   As regards political  control  allegedly  exercised
    over treatment by local aid action committees, the evidence from  those
    interviewed by the respondent was there was no  systematic  problem  of
    access being determined by political affiliation,  although  there  was
    some limited anecdotal evidence to suggest  that  in  some  areas  this
    might be the case.  Professor Barnett  had  accepted  that  in  central
    areas such as Harare and its surroundings, there would be  much  closer
    contact between NGOs and medical staff and there would therefore not be
    any substantial issues in respect of distribution.  He had specifically
    included Dema as being within  the  periphery  of  Harare.  As  far  as
    Chitungweza was concerned, this was no  more  remote  from  Harare  and
    Dema.  It was clear from Professor Ranger's report that Chitungweza had
    elected a mayor and councillors made up of MDC members.

101.  The appellants were not facing return to a rural area  but  to  Harare
    and  its  vicinity.   These  were  locations  where  the  NGOs  or  the
    international community would be able to monitor closely  the  unbiased
    distribution of aid.  It  was  submitted  that  the  evidence  did  not
    support a finding that there was any problem of  significant  diversion
    of medical resources away from those requiring treatment let alone  the
    withholding of treatment as part of a policy  deliberately  to  inflict
    harm.

102.  The general consensus in the evidence was  that  the  general  medical
    position had improved in Zimbabwe with the restoration of funds flowing
    to towards medical staff.  Hospitals  were  described  as  functioning.
    There had been evidence  that  medical  facilities  were  stretched  to
    breaking point in late 2008 but the consensus of  the  expert  evidence
    was that there had since been a  steady  improvement.   Similarly,  the
    food security outlook for January to June 2010 appeared better than  in
    previous years and the focus had shifted from the availability of  food
    to  the  availability  of  resources  to  buy  food.   Allegations   of
    persistent abuses were made in April 2009 and there  were  very  recent
    reports of villagers complaining that  ZANU-PF  officials  were  taking
    control of food aid and distributing it to party members.  However, the
    Health  and  Finance  portfolios  were  held  by  MDC  members  and  Mr
    Tsvangirai  chaired  the  Council  of  Ministers  responsible  for  the
    implementation of government policies and NGOs were now able to operate
    freely and effectively.

103.  Ms Grey argued that the situation prevailing at the time when  RN  was
    decided no longer applied.  There was evidence of violence but  it  was
    generally a targeted form of retributive violence between  ZANU-PF  and
    MDC activists.  Recent incidents had not been on the scale of April  to
    June 2008.  The risk to the appellants should be assessed on a case-by-
    case basis; the background information now showed no  ongoing  violence
    directed at non-activists and a change in the political situation since
    the power sharing agreement.   There  had  been  an  abatement  of  the
    indiscriminate violence associated with the election and it should  now
    be found that a returnee with a low profile would not be at  real  risk
    of persecution or serious harm.

104.  In summary, none of the appellants reached the threshold required  for
    a breach of Article 3.  Some treatment, both in the public and  private
    spheres, was available in Zimbabwe.  There was no evidence to support a
    finding that the Unity Government of Zimbabwe or non-State agents  were
    deliberately withholding medical treatment.  The guidance  in  domestic
    jurisprudence and by the Strasbourg Court on Article 3 was sufficiently
    certain to fulfil the requirement,  and  interference  with  Article  8
    would be in accordance with the law during the period when  the  policy
    was being updated.  An Article 8 claim could in principle  be  advanced
    alongside an Article 3 claim and the sole issue relied on  was  one  of
    access to medical treatment, but the argument would not avoid the  need
    to satisfy the exceptionality requirements in N.   There  was  no  real
    risk that any of the appellants  would  suffer  treatment  contrary  to
    Article 3 or persecution on return.

The Appellants' Submissions

105.  Ms Monaghan submitted that each individual appellant in the  light  of
    the facts relating to their appeal should succeed on  both  asylum  and
    Article 3 grounds.  The withdrawal of medical treatment being  received
    in this country would have a drastic  impact  on  the  lives  and  life
    expectancy of the appellants such as to engage Article 8.   She  argued
    that an arbitrary or deliberate denial of access  to  food  or  medical
    treatment on political grounds could amount  to  persecution  and  that
    discriminatory   measures   could   constitute   persecution   if   the
    consequences were sufficiently severe.  The position was now  confirmed
    by  the  provisions  of  the  Qualification  Directive  and   acts   of
    persecution could take the form of administrative measures  which  were
    discriminatory or implemented  in  a  discriminatory  manner.   If  the
    appellants were able to show that there was a real risk that they would
    be  denied  medical  treatment  or  food  aid  because  they  were  not
    government supporters and that their suffering would be exacerbated for
    this reason then they would be entitled to refugee status.

106.  When considering Article 3, although it was accepted  that  there  may
    be very exceptional cases where there could be a breach of  Article  3,
    those cases did not cover  intentional  acts  or  omissions  of  public
    authorities or non-State bodies.  There was  clear  evidence  given  by
    Professor Barnett of discriminatory treatment in Zimbabwe against those
    seen as not being loyal to the  regime.   This  was  confirmed  in  the
    report from Dr Mujuru-Mvere. The  background  evidence  also  confirmed
    that the political situation described  in  RN  had  not  significantly
    changed.  There was evidence that the receipt of medical treatment  had
    been politicised.  As far as the evidence obtained  by  the  respondent
    was concerned, the level of response by some agencies in that  evidence
    was more significant than the responses.   The  evidence  of  Professor
    Barnett confirmed that although some drugs were available, there was no
    regularity of the drug supply and there were significant waiting lists.
     There were not enough CD4 testing  machines  to  enable  treatment  to
    start in any reasonable period of time.  There was no evidence that the
    appellants would be able to afford drugs even if they  were  available.
    It was fanciful to argue that drugs could be purchased  by  remittances
    received  from  this  country.   There  was  significant  evidence   of
    discrimination and disadvantage arising both from  being  a  woman  and
    being in an older age bracket.  The position under Article 3  was  that
    the threshold was reached because there was the  important  aggravating
    factor that the real harm the appellants would suffer would  derive  in
    part from positive acts of the State arising  from  discrimination  and
    poor governance.

107.  Article 8 provided a broader protection  and  a  lower  threshold  for
    engagement but any interference could be justified.  She submitted that
    the interference with the appellants' right to family and private  life
    was not in accordance with the law in the absence of an existing policy
    which had now been taken from the website.  Secondly, that would  be  a
    violation of the provisions of the Disability Discrimination  Act  1995
    (DDA).

108.   Ms  Monaghan  submitted  that  removal  would  be  contrary  to   the
    provisions of  Article  14.   Considering  the  questions  set  out  in
    Wandsworth LBC v Michalak [2003] 1WLR 617:

    (1)     The decision to deport the appellant plainly  fell  within  the
        ambit of Articles 8 and 3.


    (2)     The meaning of discrimination for Article 14 purposes  included
        a duty to make reasonable adjustments.  The decision in  Thlimmenos
        held that discrimination occurred not just when there  had  been  a
        difference in treatment but also where persons, including  disabled
        and non-disabled persons, were treated  in  the  same  way  but  in
        circumstances where that treatment was  especially  disadvantageous
        to one group.  This imposed a duty to make adjustments or to  treat
        more favourably such disadvantaged  groups  so  as  to  obviate  or
        mitigate that disadvantage.


    (3)     The grounds of discrimination protected by Article 14 precludes
        discrimination on grounds of political opinion  and  discrimination
        on disability grounds would be covered by "other status" which  had
        been applied in a wide variety of cases including claims  based  on
        personal characteristics and social categorisations or qualities.


    (4)     Article 14 would be violated if there  was  no  reasonable  and
        objective justification for the discrimination.  The existence  for
        justification must be assessed in relation to the aims and  effects
        of the measure under consideration and where the discrimination was
        connected to a "suspect  class".   "The  notion  of  objective  and
        reasonable objection must be interpreted as strictly as  possible."
        "Disability" should be  regarded  as  a  suspect  class  for  these
        purposes given its highly protected status domestically, regionally
        and internationally.


109.  As it appeared to be the case that in all cases,  absent  a  violation
    of  Article  3  or  8,  the  respondent  would  remove  an   individual
    irrespective of disability, the respondent  would  inevitably  fail  to
    discharge the burden of establishing justification.   This  would  make
    any decision to remove the appellants a violation of Article 14.

110.  Ms Monaghan also argued that the respondent failed to comply with  her
    duty to  make  reasonable  adjustments  under  section  21D(2)  of  the
    Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) having adopted a  practice  or
    policy which made it impossible or unreasonably difficult  for  disable
    persons to receive any benefit which was or might be conferred and made
    it unreasonably adverse for  a  disabled  person  to  experience  being
    subjected to any detriment to which a person might be subjected.

111.  The DDA regulated discrimination against disabled persons and the  DDA
    2005 specifically extended the definition of disability so as to  treat
    people with HIV infection as disabled  from  the  point  of  diagnosis,
    whether asymptomatic or not.  The appellants  were  therefore  disabled
    within the meaning of the DDA.

112.  The appellants relied on the duties set out in section 21D(2) to  make
    reasonable adjustments.  The provisions of section 21D provide that:

        "(ii)    For the purposes of section 21D1, a public authority  also
             discriminates against a disabled person if -


             (a)  it fails to comply with the duty imposed on it by s.21E in
                 circumstances in which the effect of  that  failure  is  to
                 make it


                 (i)   impossible or unreasonably difficult for the disabled
                     person to receive  any  benefit  that  is  or  may  be
                     conferred, or


                 (ii)  unreasonably  adverse  for  the  disabled  person  to
                     experience being subject to any detriment to  which  a
                     person is or may be subjected,


                 by the carrying out of a function by the authority; and


             (b)  it cannot show that its failure to comply with  that  duty
                 is justified under subsection (3), (5) or (7)(c).


        The duty referred to in section 21D(2) under  section  21E  is  the
        duty to make reasonable adjustments.  Section 21 E provides that:


        "(i)     Subsection 2  applies  where  a  public  authority  has  a
             practice, policy or procedure which makes it -


             (a)  impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled  persons
                 to receive any benefit that is or may be conferred, or


             (b)  unreasonably adverse for disabled  persons  to  experience
                 being subject to any detriment to which a person is or  may
                 be subjected, by the carrying out  of  a  function  by  the
                 authority.


         (ii)    It is the duty of the authorities to take such steps as is
             reasonable  in  all  the  circumstances  of   the   case,   the
             authorities  would  have  to  take  in  order  to  change  that
             practice, policy or procedure so that it  no  longer  has  that
             effect."


113.  The practice of removing  the  appellants  as  failed  asylum  seekers
    would be a practice or policy which made it impossible or  unreasonably
    difficult for disabled persons to receive any benefit that is or may be
    conferred or be unreasonably adverse for disabled persons to experience
    being subject to  any  detriment  to  which  a  person  is  or  may  be
    subjected.  This  would  then  trigger  the  duty  to  make  reasonable
    adjustments which may  require  a  public  authority  to  exercise  its
    functions in a different way for a disabled person.  The duty  to  make
    reasonable adjustments  imposes  a  duty  to  take  such  steps  as  is
    reasonable in all the circumstances for it to have to take in order  to
    make reasonable adjustments.  In the light of the code of  practice  as
    to what amounts to a reasonable step, a decision not  to  remove  would
    plainly  constitute  such  a  reasonable  step  as  it  would  mitigate
    completely  the  adverse  consequences  otherwise  resulting   to   the
    appellants.  It would be plainly practicable for that step to be  taken
    as had been proved by the care provided to the appellants to-date,  the
    cost would not be prohibitive and no  disruption  would  be  caused  as
    there were no concerns about any risk  of  offending  or  the  need  to
    protect the public from criminal activities.

114.  In these circumstances it could  not,  she  argued,  be  said  by  the
    respondent that removal was necessary for the protection of the  rights
    and freedoms of others.  Ms Monaghan accepted that the code of practice
    made it clear that the principle of  proportionality  was  an  accepted
    principle of administrative law but was designed to deal with a  public
    authority having to choose between a number of courses of  action,  and
    that in order to demonstrate that an act was a proportionate  means  of
    achieving a legitimate aim the public authority must  show  that  there
    was a pressing  policy  need  supporting  the  aim  the  treatment  was
    designed to achieve, its actions were related to achieving that aim and
    there was no other way to achieve the aim that had a  less  detrimental
    impact on the rights of disabled people.

115.  The legitimate aim here could  be  said  to  be  the  preservation  of
    available NHS services for HIV sufferers who have leave  to  remain  in
    the UK independently of their HIV status but the mere identification of
    a legitimate aim was not sufficient by itself.   The  means  chosen  to
    achieve the aim must be proportionate and require consideration of  the
    alternative means of achieving that aim.  Given the impact  of  removal
    on the appellants the respondent could not discharge that  burden.   It
    followed, so she argued,  that  removal  in  the  present  cases  would
    constitute unlawful discrimination contrary to section 21B in light  of
    section 21D, E of the DDA.

116.  Ms Monaghan also relied on the general and  specific  equality  duties
    set out in s.49 of the DDA requiring institutional frameworks necessary
    to ensure that "due regard is had to the equality objectives in section
    49".  This involved an assessment  process  of  the  impact  or  likely
    impact of policies and practices on equality for disabled people.   The
    general disability equality duty and  its  requirement  to  conduct  an
    impact assessment operated as a restriction  on  a  public  authority's
    decision-making function.  It was  not  clear  from  the  UKBA  website
    whether that agency had  undertaken  any  form  of  DDA  assessment  in
    relation to its removal policy for failed asylum seekers.  If there was
    no such impact assessment this  in  itself  rendered  the  decision  to
    remove unlawful and would require the decision to be taken again.  Even
    if the respondent might  lawfully  have  exercised  his  discretion  in
    precisely the same way after giving proportionate weight to the matters
    set out in section 49A, it could not be assumed that  they  would,  and
    undertaking a public impact assessment meant keeping an  open  mind  on
    that issue.  Ms Monaghan also referred to  the  UN  Convention  on  the
    Rights of Persons with Disabilities arguing that this Convention should
    inform the respondent's decision and in any event the  evidence  as  to
    discrimination and of the lack of availability of  ARVs  would  violate
    fundamental principles of the Convention.

117.  In summary,  she  submitted  that  the  appellants  were  entitled  to
    recognition as refugees.  The appellants could not show  allegiance  to
    ZANU-PF and there was no proper basis from departing from the  guidance
    in RN.  The appellants would be subjected  to  ill-treatment  breaching
    the Article 3 threshold on the basis of a discriminatory exclusion from
    access  to  medical  treatment  and  food  aid.    The   discriminatory
    deprivation of food and other medical services  arose  from  deliberate
    policy decisions made by the State acting through  its  chosen  agents.
    The ability to  access  medication  in  the  appellants'  circumstances
    distinguished their position from that in N by reason of the deliberate
    policy of denying access to MDC  supporters,  a  wide-scale  government
    corruption and diversion of funds, the fact the health  system  was  in
    disarray and that the ARVs available to the  private  sector  were  far
    beyond the means of  the  appellants.   Their  situation  fell  into  a
    different category from the position of  the  appellant  in  N  as  the
    situation in  Zimbabwe  was  of  a  wholly  different  magnitude.   The
    appellants also relied on Articles 8 and 14.  The  discrimination  they
    would be subjected to went to  the  very  heart  of  fundamental  human
    rights, their right to  physical  integrity  and  access  to  food  and
    medical treatment.  The decisions were in breach  of  the  respondent's
    obligations under the DDA  and  the  respondent's  decisions  were  not
    lawful as there was no policy in place in respect of  individuals  with
    HIV.

The Legal Framework

Article 3

118.  Article 3 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  provides  as
    follows:

        "No-one shall be subjected to torture or to  inhuman  or  degrading
        treatment or punishment."

      This is an unqualified right.  It was established in Pretty  v  United
    Kingdom (Application No 2346/02 ECHR 2002 at  paragraph  52)  that  the
    types of inhuman or degrading treatment falling  within  the  scope  of
    Article 3 must attain a minimum level of severity and involve  actually
    bodily injury or intense physical or mental  suffering.   It  is  clear
    from the decision of the House of Lords in R v Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department ex parte Adam Limbuela and Tesema  [2005]  UKHL  66
    that, though the threshold is a high one in  cases  such  as,  in  that
    case, not involving the deliberate infliction of pain or suffering, the
    threshold could be crossed  if  an  appellant  with  no  means  and  no
    alternative sources of support and unable to support  himself  was,  by
    the deliberate action of the state, denied shelter, food  or  the  most
    basic necessities  of  life.   Treatment  may  be  described  as  being
    "degrading" where it is such as  to  arouse  in  the  victims  of  that
    treatment  feelings  of  fear,  anguish  and  inferiority  capable   of
    humiliating and debasing them  (Garabayev  v  Russia  (Application  no.
    38411/02), paragraph 75).

119.  A number of ECHR authorities have addressed the  issue  of  Article  3
    and illness.  In D v The United Kingdom, the applicant was  a  national
    of St Kitts, who had been convicted and sentenced in the United Kingdom
    in connection with a drugs offence.   The  United  Kingdom  authorities
    sought to deport him on completion of his sentence but by that time  he
    was in the advanced stages of AIDS.  The Court found that he was in the
    advanced stages of a terminal and incurable illness and that the abrupt
    withdrawal of facilities permitting a limited quality  of  life  to  be
    enjoyed would have dramatic consequences for him.  The  United  Kingdom
    had assumed responsibility for treating him since August  1994  and  he
    had become reliant on the medical and palliative care which he  was  at
    present receiving and was no doubt psychologically prepared  for  death
    and in an environment which was both familiar  and  compassionate.   It
    could not be said that the conditions which would confront him  in  the
    receiving country were themselves a breach of the standards of  Article
    3, but his removal would expose him to a real risk of dying under  most
    distressing circumstances and would thus amount to  inhuman  treatment.
    There was a serious danger that the conditions and  adversity  awaiting
    him in St  Kitts  would  subject  him  to  acute  mental  and  physical
    suffering and there was no evidence that the sole relative resident  in
    St Kitts, a cousin, was willing to attend to his needs or to any  other
    form of moral or social support.  Lack of shelter and  of  proper  diet
    would expose him to further health and sanitation problems.  The  Court
    concluded that given the very exceptional circumstances of the case and
    the  compelling  humanitarian  considerations,  implementation  of  the
    decision to remove the applicant would be a violation of Article 3.

120.  Subsequent to D and before the next case which  we  must  consider  in
    detail, that of N, no cases were found to show a violation of Article 3
    on grounds of an applicant's ill health where it was proposed to remove
    him.  The Commission found a breach to be established in  BB  v  France
    but a friendly settlement was  reached  before  the  case  came  to  be
    considered by the Court.  In Karara v Finland No. 40900/98,  Commission
    decision of 29 May 1998 and Henao v The Netherlands (dec) No. 13669/03,
    24 June 2003, applications were held inadmissible which sought to  rely
    upon Article 3 where the applicant's illness had  not  yet  reached  an
    advanced or terminal stage.  Also found to be inadmissible was a  claim
    to entitlement to remain in the territory of  a  contracting  state  in
    order to continue to benefit from medical, social  or  other  forms  of
    assistance provided by the expelling state (SCC v Sweden [2000] 28 EHRR
    CD 245, paragraph 1).  In that case, however, it  was  emphasised  that
    all the circumstances of  the  case,  and  especially  the  applicant's
    personal situation, had to be scrutinised rigorously.

121.  In N v United Kingdom, the Grand Chamber considered a  case  involving
    a Ugandan who had claimed asylum in the United  Kingdom,  and  reviewed
    the case law relating to illness and Article 3.  At  paragraph  42  the
    Court said the following:

        "42.     In summary, the Court observes that since D v  the  United
             Kingdom it has constantly applied the following principle.


            Aliens who are subject to expulsion cannot in  principle  claim
             any entitlement to remain in the  territory  of  a  Contracting
             State in order to continue to benefit from medical,  social  or
             other  forms  of  assistance  and  services  provided  by   the
             expelling State.  The fact that the applicant's  circumstances,
             including his life expectancy, would be  significantly  reduced
             if he were to be removed from  the  Contracting  State  is  not
             sufficient in itself to give rise to breach of Article 3.   The
             decision to remove an alien who is  suffering  from  a  serious
             mental or physical illness to a country  where  the  facilities
             for the  treatment  of  that  illness  are  inferior  to  those
             available in the contracting state may  raise  an  issue  under
             Article 3, but only in  a  very  exceptional  case,  where  the
             humanitarian grounds against the removal  are  compelling.   In
             the D case the very exceptional  circumstances  were  that  the
             applicant was critically ill and appeared to be close to death,
             could not be guaranteed any nursing  or  medical  care  in  his
             country of origin and had no family there willing  or  able  to
             care for him or provide him with even a basic  level  of  food,
             shelter or social support."

122.  The Court went on to say that it did not exclude that there  might  be
    other very exceptional cases where the humanitarian considerations were
    equally compelling but considered that  it  should  maintain  the  high
    threshold set in D  and  applied  in  subsequent  case  law,  which  it
    regarded as correct in principle given that in such cases  the  alleged
    future harm would emanate not from the intentional acts or omissions of
    public authorities or non-state bodies but  instead  from  a  naturally
    occurring illness and the lack of sufficient resources to deal with  it
    in the receiving country.

123.  In ZT, the appellant was a citizen  of  Zimbabwe  who  fairly  shortly
    after her arrival in the United Kingdom in July 2000 was  diagnosed  as
    being HIV Positive.  She sought leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    on the basis that to return her to Zimbabwe, where  treatment  for  her
    very serious illness would be difficult or impossible to obtain,  would
    infringe her human rights.

124.  It was said on behalf of the appellant that  a  point  of  distinction
    between that case and previous jurisprudence was that whereas in N  the
    receiving country, Uganda, was making  proper  efforts  to  counter  an
    impossibly difficult situation, in the present case the difficulties in
    Zimbabwe had been significantly contributed to by  the  policy  of  the
    government  itself,  in  particular   in   its   malevolent   attitude,
    discriminatory  practices  in  the  application  of   healthcare,   and
    systematic violations of humanitarian and human rights  laws.   It  was
    argued by analogy with the decision of the Court  of  Human  Rights  in
    Soering 11 EHRR 439,  that  a  separate  category  of  liability  under
    Article 3 arose where the lack of healthcare  of  which  the  applicant
    complained was directly the fault of the receiving state.

125.  The Court considered this argument to be misconceived as  a  point  of
    law.  It was said that Soering came nowhere near  to  laying  down  any
    special rule about the behaviour of the receiving state,  and  that  in
    the particular factual category of health cases, N laid down the  rules
    as to how Article 3 should be applied.  Those rules included a specific
    requirement of exceptional circumstances and did not include a  special
    sub-category turning on the behaviour of the receiving state.   It  was
    said that if, as was plain, there was no special rule of  law  relating
    to the behaviour of the receiving  state,  then  the  weight  that  the
    Tribunal gave to that behaviour must be a matter for  the  judgment  of
    the Tribunal applying the guidance in N.

126.  Buxton LJ went on to say at paragraph 18 that,  that  said,  he  could
    envisage a case in which the particular treatment afforded to  an  AIDS
    sufferer on return, in terms of ostracism, humiliation  or  deprivation
    of basic rights that was added to her  existing  medical  difficulties,
    could create an exceptional case in terms  of  the  guidance  given  by
    Baroness Hale of Richmond in N [2005] 2 AC 296 where she had said  that
    the test in that sort of case was whether the applicant's  illness  had
    reached such a critical stage (i.e. he was  dying)  that  it  would  be
    inhuman treatment to deprive him of the care he was currently receiving
    and send him home to an early death unless  there  was  care  available
    there to enable him to meet that fate with  dignity.   She  also  noted
    that there might of  course  be  other  exceptional  cases  with  other
    extreme  facts  where  the  humanitarian  considerations  were  equally
    compelling.

127.   Nor  did  the  Court  of  Appeal  see  any  merit  to  the  suggested
    distinction between the facts  of  ZT  and  N,  in  that  ZT  had  only
    contracted or at least only presented with HIV  after  she  arrived  in
    this country and was given temporary leave to enter  as  a  visitor  in
    contrast to N who was already HIV Positive on  arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The Court of Appeal concluded that ZT and N were in the  same
    position as never having had any right to be in the United Kingdom  and
    in the absence of the present proceedings any  permissive  presence  in
    the United Kingdom would have been terminated nearly  five  years  ago.
    Lord Nicholls at paragraph 16 of N had made no distinction,  nor  could
    he have done, based on the respective  circumstances  of  the  original
    arrival in the United Kingdom.

The Refugee Convention

128.  It  can  be  seen  from  paragraph  53  of  the  UNHCR  Handbook  that
    discriminatory measures combined with other  adverse  factors  may,  if
    taken together, amount to  persecution.   The  Qualification  Directive
    provides guidance on  the  meaning  of  "acts  of  persecution"  within
    Article 1A of the Refugee Convention.  This provides as follows:

        "1.      Acts of persecution within the meaning of  Article  1A  of
             the Geneva Convention must:


             (a)  be sufficiently serious by their nature or  repetition  as
                 to constitute a severe violation of basic human rights,  in
                 particular the rights from which derogation cannot be  made
                 under Article 15(2) of  the  European  Convention  for  the
                 Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; or


             (b)   be  an  accumulation  of  various   measures,   including
                 violations of human rights which is sufficiently severe  as
                 to affect an individual in a similar manner as affected  in
                 (a).


        2. Acts of persecution as qualified  in  paragraph  1,  can,  inter
             alia, take the form of:


             (a)  acts of physical or mental  violence,  including  acts  of
                 sexual violence;


             (b)  legal, administrative,  police  and/or  judicial  measures
                 which  are  in  themselves  discriminatory  or  which   are
                 implemented in a discriminatory manner;


             (c)  prosecution or punishment, which  is  disproportionate  or
                 discriminatory..."

129.  In Ullah v Special Adjudicator [2004] UKHL  26,  Lord  Steyn  endorsed
    the human rights approach dictated  by  the  preamble  to  the  Refugee
    Convention as propounded by Professor Hathaway in The  Law  of  Refugee
    Status where he defined persecution as  "The  sustained  or  systematic
    failure of state protection in relation to one of the core entitlements
    which has been recognised by the international community".  Though lack
    of medical treatment or food which is attributable to insufficiency  of
    resources does not give rise to any arguable breach of  the  Convention
    regardless of the degree of suffering involved, (whether or not it is a
    consequence  of  mismanagement  of  the  economy),  the  arbitrary   or
    deliberate denial of access to food on political grounds may amount  to
    persecution.  In RN (Returnees) Zimbabwe CG  [2008]  UKAIT  00083,  the
    Tribunal gave very thorough and careful consideration to the  issue  of
    risk on return to Zimbabwe.  At paragraph  249  the  Tribunal  accepted
    that discriminatory exclusion from  access  to  food  aid  was  capable
    itself of constituting persecution  for  a  reason  recognised  by  the
    Refugee Convention.  At paragraph  250  the  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    evidence now established that the government of Zimbabwe had  used  its
    control of the distribution of food aid as  a  political  tool  to  the
    disadvantage of those thought to be potential supporters  of  the  MDC,
    and  that  this  discriminatory  deprivation  of  food  from  perceived
    political opponents, taken together with the disruption of the  efforts
    of NGOs to distribute food by means of the ban introduced in June 2008,
    amounted to persecution of those deprived of access to  this  essential
    support.

130.  It  can  be  seen  from  paragraph  53  of  the  UNHCR  Handbook  that
    discriminatory measures combined  with  other  factors  may,  if  taken
    together, amount to persecution.

Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention

131.  It is well established that the private life aspect of Article  8  may
    be engaged in a case which involves physical or mental  health.   Thus,
    for example, in Bensaid v United Kingdom [2001] 33 EHRR 10, it was said
    that mental health must be regarded as a crucial part of  private  life
    associated with the aspect of moral integrity, and there is  no  reason
    why this would not extend to physical health also.

132.  In R v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  ex  parte  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27, Lord Bingham said (at paragraph 10):

         "...the rights protected  by  article  8  can  be  engaged  by  the
         foreseeable consequences for health  of  removal  from  the  United
         Kingdom pursuant  to  an  immigration  decision,  even  where  such
         removal does not violate article 3, if the facts relied on  by  the
         applicant are sufficiently strong...  It would seem plain that,  as
         with medical treatment so with welfare, an  applicant  could  never
         hope to resist an expulsion decision without showing something very
         much more extreme than relative disadvantage as compared  with  the
         expelling state."

133.  In N the European Court of  Human  Rights  engaged  briefly  with  the
    applicant's argument that the circumstances facing  her  on  return  to
    Uganda would engage her right to respect for her private life, but  did
    not consider that any separate issue arose under Article 8.

134.  It is relevant however to note JA.  The  appellants  had  entered  the
    United Kingdom lawfully and they  were  thereafter  diagnosed  for  the
    first time as being HIV Positive and treated with anti-retroviral drugs
    which stabilised their conditions and kept them stable.  Both had  been
    granted leave to remain in 2002 specifically to continue with treatment
    for HIV pursuant to the then existing Home Office policy.  The Court of
    Appeal considered that, though the argument for a formal assumption  of
    responsibility went too high, the real question was  how  far  in  each
    case the proportionality of removal was affected by the history of  the
    compassionate grant and renewal  of  leave  to  remain  for  treatment,
    having regard to the impact both of that history and  of  the  proposed
    discontinuance of treatment on the individual's  life.   This,  it  was
    considered, placed the appellants in a significantly different position
    from the appellants in D and N.  It was considered that in the case  of
    JA, as a continuously lawful entrant, she  was  in  a  different  legal
    class from N so she was not  called  upon  to  demonstrate  exceptional
    circumstances as compelling as those in D.  Their appeal  was  remitted
    back to the Tribunal to make  findings  on  all  issues  arising  under
    Article 8(2), the Court of Appeal noting that there had been no finding
    by the Tribunal that she had much hope, if any, of  securing  treatment
    if returned to the Ivory Coast and therefore as  to  the  severity  and
    consequences of removal.

Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights

135.  Article 14 states as follows:

        "The enjoyment of  the  rights  and  freedoms  set  forth  in  this
        Convention shall be secured without discrimination  on  any  ground
        such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political  or  other
        opinion, national or social origin,  association  with  a  national
        minority, property, birth or other status."

136.  In Wandsworth LBC v Michalak [2003] 1 WLR 617,  it  was  said  by  the
    Court of Appeal that in considering the issues arising under Article 14
    the Court is required generally to approach its task  in  a  structured
    way, considering the following four questions:

    (1)    Do the facts fall within  the  ambit  of  one  or  more  of  the
         substantive Convention provisions?


    (2)    If so, was there different  treatment  as  respects  that  right
         between the claimant on the one hand and the chosen comparators  on
         the other?

    (3)    Were the chosen comparators in an  analogous  situation  to  the
         claimant's situation?


    (4)    If so, did the difference in treatment  have  an  objective  and
         reasonable justification?

137.  The point was made that this was  only  a  framework  and  there  were
    potential overlaps between considerations relevant in the determination
    of at least the last two and possibly the last three questions, and  it
    was necessary to be cautious about treating the questions as  a  series
    of hurdles to be surmounted in turn.  In Thlimmenos v Greece [2001]  31
    EHRR 14, it was established that the discrimination might arise  either
    because analogous  groups  were  treated  differently  or  when  states
    without an objective  and  reasonable  justification  failed  to  treat
    differently persons whose situations were significantly different.

                                 Disability


         1  Meaning of 'disability' and 'disabled person'


         (1)      Subject to the provisions of Schedule 1, a  person  has  a
         disability for the purposes of this Act [and Part III of  the  2005
         Order] if he has a  physical  or  mental  impairment  which  has  a
         substantial and long-term adverse effect on his  ability  to  carry
         out normal day-to-day activities.


         (2)      In this Act [and Part iii of  the  2005  Order]  'disabled
         person' means a person who has a disability."


         "[18B     Reasonable adjustments: supplementary]


         [(1)     In determining whether it is reasonable for  a  person  to
         have to take a particular step in order to comply with  a  duty  to
         make reasonable adjustments, regard shall be had, in particular, to-




             (a) the extent to which taking  the  step  would  prevent  the
             effect in relation to which the duty is imposed;


             (b) the extent to which it is practicable for him to take  the
             step;


             (c) the financial and other costs which would be  incurred  by
             him in taking the step and the extent to which taking it would
             disrupt any of his activities;


             (d) the extent of his financial and other resources;


             (e) the availability to him of financial or  other  assistance
             with respect to taking the step;


             (f)  the  nature  of  his  activities  and  the  size  of  his
             undertaking;


             (g) where the step would be taken in  relation  to  a  private
             household, the extent to which taking it would-


                       (i)   disrupt that household, or


                       (ii)  disturb any person residing there.


         (2)      The following are examples of steps  which  a  person  may
         need to take in relation to a disabled person in  order  to  comply
         with a duty to make reasonable adjustments-


             (a) making adjustments to premises;


             (b) allocating some of the disabled person's duties to another
             person;


             (c) transferring him to fill an existing vacancy;


             (d) altering his hours of working or training;


             (e) assigning him to a different place of work or training;


             (f) allowing him to be absent during working or training hours
             for rehabilitation, assessment or treatment;


             (g) giving, or arranging for, training or  mentoring  (whether
             for the disabled person or any other person);


             (h) acquiring or modifying equipment;


             (i) modifying instructions or reference manuals;


             (j) modifying procedures for testing or assessment;


             (k) providing a reader or interpreter;


             (l) providing supervision or other support.


         (3)      For the purposes of a duty to make reasonable adjustments,
         where under any binding obligation a person is required  to  obtain
         the consent of another person to any  alteration  of  the  premises
         occupied by him-


             (a) it is always reasonable for him to have to take  steps  to
             obtain that consent; and


             (b) it is never reasonable  for  him  to  have  to  make  that
             alteration before that consent is obtained.


         (4)      The steps referred to in subsection (3)(a)  shall  not  be
         taken to include an application to a court or tribunal.


         (5)      In subsection (3), 'binding obligation'  means  a  legally
         binding obligation (not contained in a lease (within the meaning of
         section 18A(3)) in relation to the premises, whether  arising  from
         an agreement or otherwise.


         (6)       A  provision  of  this  Part  imposing  a  duty  to  make
         reasonable adjustments applies only for the purpose of  determining
         whether a person has discriminated against a disabled  person;  and
         accordingly a breach of any such duty is not actionable as such.]"

         also discriminates against a disabled person if-


             (a) it fails to comply with a duty imposed on  it  by  section
             21E in circumstances in which the effect of that failure is to
             make it-


                  (i)  impossible or unreasonably difficult for the disabled
                  person to receive any benefit that is or may be conferred,

             necessary for the protection of rights and freedoms  of  other

         (5)      Treatment,  or  a  failure  to  comply  with  a  duty,  is
         justified under this subsection if the acts of the public authority
         which give rise to the treatment or  failure  are  a  proportionate
         means of achieving a legitimate aim.

         section, as to circumstances in which it is, or as to circumstances
         in which it is not, reasonable for a public authority to  hold  the
         opinion mentioned in subsection (3)(a).

             (b) alter it so that it no longer has that effect;


             (c) provide a reasonable means of avoiding the feature; or

         (7)      It is the duty of the authority to take such steps  as  it

             the meaning of 'practice, policy or procedure';


             (d) as to things which are, or as to things which are not,  to
             be treated as physical features;


             (e) as to things which are, or as to things which are not,  to

         (9)      Nothing in this section requires  a  public  authority  to
         take any steps which, apart from this section, it has no  power  to
         take.


         (10)     This section imposes  duties  only  for  the  purposes  of
         determining whether a public authority has,  for  the  purposes  of

         accordingly a breach of any such duty is not actionable as such.]"

Country Background Evidence

138.  For  the  appellants  expert  reports  were  produced  from  Professor
    Anthony Barnett, Dr Steve  Kibble,  Dr  Naomi  Mujuru-Mvere,  Professor
    Terence Ranger, Dr Rachel Baggaley, and medical reports  from  Dr  John
    Day and Dr Jane Minton.  From the respondent we have a report from  the
    British Embassy in  Harare  entitled  "Availability  of  treatment  for
    HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe".  We also  have  a  number  of  other  pieces  of
    background evidence comprising in the main reports  from  a  number  of
    bodies and news items.

Professor Barnett

139.  Professor Anthony Barnett has provided a report dated 27 January  2010
    which was supplemented in his  oral  evidence.   Professor  Barnett  is
    presently  Professorial  Research  Fellow  at  the  London  School   of
    Economics and Political Science and Honorary Professor  at  the  London
    School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  Since 1987 his main  research
    focus has been the implication of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in  Africa  for
    social and economic life, and he  has  published  extensively  in  this
    area.  Though he is not a medical doctor,  he  has  acquired  extensive
    knowledge of the science of HIV and the clinical treatment of AIDS.

140.  In his report Professor Barnett at pages 5  to  6  quotes  from  three
    other reports, the first from IRIN, a news gathering facility supported
    by the UN Office for Coordination of  Humanitarian  Affairs,  a  report
    from Africanpress.wordpress.com, and a report from the Organisation for
    Physicians for Human Rights.  The first of these, dated  7  July  2009,
    reports on difficulties in Bulawayo for municipal health officials  who
    are said to be struggling to cope with growing waiting lists of  people
    in need of HIV treatment and a lack of doctors to prescribe the  drugs.
    It is feared that it might take up to a year before a person is put  on
    ARV drug therapy.  The second report, also from July  2009,  refers  to
    concerns on the part of government officials in Zimbabwe at a  decision
    by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria ("the Global
    Fund"), to ditch the National  AIDS  Council  (NAC)  as  the  principal
    recipient of its existing and future  grants  and  instead  to  channel
    funds to the United Nations Development  Programme  (UNDP).   There  is
    reference to the fact  that  seven  months  ago  the  Reserve  Bank  of
    Zimbabwe (RBZ) admitted diverting over US$7  million  from  the  Global
    Fund's Round 5 Grant  earmarked  for  scaling  up  the  national  anti-
    retroviral programme.  The third report, from January 2009, says  among
    other things that for HIV/AIDS the most  severe  threat  has  been  the
    interruption of regular supplies of anti-retroviral drugs.  It is  said
    that the  organisation  had  been  told  by  multiple  key  informants,
    patients and providers  that  supplies  had  become  irregular  due  to
    breakdowns in drug delivery, distribution, provision and theft  of  ARV
    drugs by ZANU-PF operatives.  There is reference to a current  collapse
    of the system and that  HIV  programmes  are  currently  being  capped.
    There is also reference  to  troubling  reports  that  physicians  were
    switching patients on established ARV regimens to other regimens  based
    not on clinical need but on drug availability.

141.  Professor Barnett expresses concerns for the appellant RS  in  respect
    of whom specifically his  report  was  prepared,  that  she  would  not
    survive having to wait a year before being put  on  ARV  drug  therapy,
    comments on the lack of  hesitation  on  the  part  of  the  Zimbabwean
    government in diverting funds specifically earmarked for ARVs to  other
    purposes, and expresses concerns  that  the  appellant  would  be  very
    unlikely to access treatment and if able to do so it would be irregular
    and  inappropriate  to  her  needs.   Professor  Barnett  refers  to  a
    conversation he has had with a person who has  spoken  directly  to  Mr
    Mugabe who on  one  occasion  said  that  as  Zimbabwe  is  subject  to
    sanctions by the UK and others it was quite reasonable and rational for
    the Zimbabwean government to ensure that any ARVs  were  preferentially
    available to  ZANU-PF  cadres  if  the  state  was  to  remain  viable.
    Professor Barnett also says that in  many  cases  local  officials  and
    local state employees have not changed since the recent  power  sharing
    agreement and that this is certainly the case with the lowest levels of
    organisation, the village councils, and it is at  this  level  that  in
    rural areas AIDS committees have the potential to facilitate  or  block
    an individual's access to medication.  He goes on to refer to the  fact
    that in around 2005 the government of Zimbabwe established a  structure
    of  AIDS  committees,  the  intention  being  to  create  AIDS   action
    committees, provincial AIDS action committees  in  all  provinces,  and
    district  AIDS  action  committees  in  districts,  ward  AIDS   action
    committees at sub-district level and village AIDS action committees  in
    all villages.  He describes  the  nature  and  powers  of  the  various
    committees and says that the entire structure  has  always  been  under
    tight political control.  He says that in practical terms it  has  been
    known for some years that when very  limited  supplies  of  medications
    were available at a few public  facilities,  people  seeking  treatment
    were required to produce a ZANU-PF  membership  card  before  receiving
    available medications.  He refers to the report of Dr Baggaley in  this
    regard.  He goes on to say that he believes it still  to  be  the  case
    that party membership cards  may  be  demanded  by  people  controlling
    access to goods and services including access to medical  services  and
    that his  understanding  is  that  in  rural  areas  a  person  seeking
    treatment is expected to approach the local AIDS committee for a letter
    to take to the public medical facility.  These processes are  described
    in great detail in Dr Mujuru-Mvere's doctoral  thesis  of  March  2004.
    Professor Barnett says it  is  inevitable  that  the  makeup  of  local
    committees reflects the local political balance and  that  evidently  a
    committee member who is a ZANU-PF supporter is unlikely to  certify  or
    support someone whom he or she knows to be a supporter of the MDC.   He
    provides a diagram which shows the process whereby funds flow from  the
    top of the system to the village level  and  where  and  how  political
    influence can be exercised.  He goes on to  say  with  respect  to  the
    availability of RS's medications, that the  evidence  shows  that  they
    will not be available through the state system as the government has no
    money to pay for their import and they are not manufactured locally.

142.  Professor Barnett goes on to characterise  medical  treatment  in  the
    public sector as extremely unpredictable,  and  poorly  resourced.   He
    refers to the practical difficulties for RS  of  seeking  treatment  in
    Harare some 30 kilometres away  from  her  home.   As  regards  private
    sector medication, he has spoken within the last two months of the time
    of that  report,  and,  as  we  have  seen,  more  recently  again,  to
    pharmacists at Avondale Shops and Cameron Pharmacy in Harare concerning
    availability of specific ARVs.  Thus it would appear that, at least  at
    the time of the report,  RS's  drug  regimen  could  be  purchased  for
    approximately USD$100 per month, though his more recent researches were
    more pessimistic.  He considers it to  be  very  unlikely  indeed  that
    supplies of her medications would be securely available in Dema through
    the private sector, let alone via the public  sector.   He  notes  that
    though Dema has a small public rural  hospital,  it  does  not  have  a
    pharmacy, and therefore considers it  doubtful  whether  there  is  any
    public medical provision for ARV treatment  in  Dema.   He  understands
    that Dema is a strongly ZANU-PF area to the south west of  Harare.   He
    also considers it to be unlikely that the appellant would  be  able  to
    gain employment, bearing in mind the very high level  of  unemployment,
    being above 94% of the population.

143.  Professor Barnett goes on  to  note  medical  evidence  from  Dr  Day,
    showing that RS's virus had developed insensitivity to  some  ARVs  and
    the fact that she would require good  clinical  laboratory  support  in
    addition to her medications if she were to maintain her current  health
    status.  He considers that the necessary support in the  public  sector
    is unpredictable and often unavailable.

144.  Professor Barnett goes on to  comment  on  the  current  situation  in
    Zimbabwe.  There are progressive difficulties in  gathering  dependable
    information.  It is known from the United Nations World Food  Programme
    (WFP) and from news reports that food has been  and  remains  in  short
    supply and he says that at times food supplies have been restricted  by
    administrative action to those who can show that they are supporters of
    ZANU-PF.  He mentions the fact that major NGOs such as the IFRC/RC  are
    now able to operate relatively freely and effectively within  Zimbabwe,
    and also that these organisations have been  able  to  distribute  food
    vouchers to some people, notably in urban areas.  Allegiance to ZANU-PF
    is a significant entrance qualification to employment, particularly  in
    the public sector, and it may also be the case with some private sector
    employers, and employment opportunities of  any  kind  are  very  small
    indeed in rural areas.  In effect he considers there has been little if
    any change with the accession of Mr Tsvangirai to office.  As  well  as
    the NGOs beginning to work in the country with regard to food  aid,  it
    seems that some other NGOs,  typically  missions,  are  re-establishing
    themselves and are able to provide some limited ARVs to people in their
    local areas, but that even so accessing such limited  services  can  be
    hard or impossible for poor people.  He is not  aware  of  any  NGO  or
    mission providing ARVs in or around Dema.  In effect he  endorses  what
    is to be found in the Country of Origin Information  Report  (COIR)  of
    July 2009 and the views at paragraph 4 in the country guidance case  of
    RN.

145.  Professor Barnett refers to the situation concerning ZANU-PF and  ARVs
    as being complex.  He says that it does not fit into simple generalised
    explanations where a visit to a health facility may  inevitably  result
    in a request for a ZANU-PF card or some other form of authorisation but
    what is to be seen from the  objective  evidence  he  summarises  is  a
    variety of mechanisms whereby government policy results in supplies  of
    ARVs being directed favourably to those who are likely  to  be  ZANU-PF
    members.  In regard to this he refers to reports of  ZANU-PF  diverting
    medications, the report which he cites speaks of "theft", and there are
    also reports of people being required to present  membership  cards  at
    public medical facilities, and he refers also to the diverting  by  the
    Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe of over USD$7 million from the  Global  Fund's
    Round 5.  He refers to the issue of the collapse of  medical  services,
    quoting from the July 2009 COIR.  He considers that if RS were returned
    to Zimbabwe she would have to receive treatment in the  private  sector
    and that if she  missed  her  medication  for  more  than  one  or  two
    occasions  per  month  her  viral  population   would   soon   increase
    dramatically and would evolve to be resistant to the  medications  with
    which she is currently being treated.  She would be very vulnerable  to
    a wide range of waterborne infections such  as  cholera,  and  also  to
    widespread tuberculosis.  His conclusion is that she has little  or  no
    chance of obtaining the medications and clinical care she requires  for
    treatment of her HIV disease.

146.  Professor Barnett also considers the issue of stigma  on  return  from
    the United Kingdom and in this regard  again  quotes  from  Dr  Mujuru-
    Mvere's thesis of 2004.  He considers that  there  is  no  identifiable
    reason why women's circumstances should have altered dramatically since
    she did her research.  There she notes matters such as a lack of  rural
    women's voice in their own  families  and  households  and  a  lack  of
    effective   representation   in    decision-making    bodies,    gender
    discrimination at all levels of society and fear of  discrimination  on
    grounds of the stigma of HIV.  It would be assumed  that  RS  had  been
    infected by HIV in the United Kingdom and  she  would  be  seen  as  an
    assumed MDC member or sympathiser, given the amount  of  time  she  has
    been in the United Kingdom.  She would,  as  a  person  returning  from
    abroad, have to join the end of the long  queues  for  what  treatments
    might be available in the public sector.

Dr Kibble

147.  Dr Steve Kibble works for  Progressio,  an  international  development
    charity working for justice.  His report is dated 22 February 2010.  He
    has worked on Zimbabwean and Southern African issues for this institute
    (formerly the Catholic Institute  for  International  Relations)  since
    1990, and has been to Zimbabwe on a number of occasions, most  recently
    in October/November 2009.  Dr Kibble  comments  on  the  political  and
    human rights situation in Zimbabwe.  He notes weaknesses in the  Global
    Political Agreement (GPA) and refers to recent arrests  of  members  of
    civil  society,  journalists,  human  rights   activists,   independent
    newspaper distributors, lawyers and MDC  officials.   In  spite  of  an
    undertaking in the GPA to deal with violence and its  perpetrators  and
    the overwhelming amount of empirical evidence in this regard,  impunity
    continues to  characterise  the  situation.   Levels  of  violence  and
    intimidation initially  reduced  but  a  recent  survey  suggests  that
    requisite  levels  of  fear  and  related  immobilisation   are   being
    maintained.  He refers  to  the  fact  that  half  the  new  government
    ministers are from ZANU-PF, which party retains, with the exception  of
    the finance  ministry,  the  most  important  portfolios  in  terms  of
    reflecting "power".  He says that there is no evidence that the ZANU-PF-
    aligned civil servants, military or police  are  obeying  any  new  MDC
    minister and that there is plenty  of  evidence  that  they  are  being
    obstructive and considers that it is even less likely  that  the  youth
    militia and war veterans would be any different.  He  refers  to  polls
    reporting that support for ZANU-PF has dropped below 10% even in  areas
    that had been no-go areas for the MDC and  that  the  majority  of  the
    population appear to credit the MDC with  turning  round  the  economy.
    There are conflicts between the ZANU-PF factions, for example divisions
    inside the Harare party and over the vice-presidential succession.   He
    says that the economy has shrunk by over 80% since 1999, a record for a
    country not at war, and  has  seen  disastrous  land  reform  policies,
    draconian measures for  curbing  civil  and  political  liberties,  the
    plundering of the economy by the government, a devastating HIV and AIDS
    epidemic, cholera and widespread hunger and dependency on outside  food
    aid.  He  says  that  Zimbabwe's  once  admired  social  services  have
    collapsed in the face of the economic  crisis  and  the  HIV  and  AIDS
    epidemic.  Zimbabwe has one of the  highest  HIV  and  AIDS  prevalence
    rates in the world, recorded at 15.3% in 2007, and that  in  2006  life
    expectancy had dropped from 61 years in 1990 to 34 for women and 37 for
    men.  EU special measures ("sanctions") against the ZANU-PF elite  were
    renewed in February 2010 and  Zimbabwe  stands  as  the  151st  poorest
    country out of the world's 177 ranked countries three  years  ago,  and
    indications were that it had now declined further.  The rural poor  are
    said to be more or less out of the mainstream economy and are dependent
    upon harvesting, trading and survival.  Although the harvest looked  to
    be marginally better this year, the need for aid was acute with 80%  of
    the population having been in need of food aid and half  of  the  maize
    requirements having to be imported.  Initial estimates made by  the  UN
    Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Food programme  (WFP)
    were that about 2.8 million people would  need  food  assistance  until
    April 2010.  Major hospitals had almost closed down due to staff exodus
    and unavailability of drugs, although public  sector  workers  went  on
    strike again in February 2010.

148.  There had been a failure to overcome  institutionalised  violence  and
    though there had  been  some  initial  scaling  down  of  the  violence
    directed  against  civic  and  opposition  members  from  the   extreme
    oppression of 2008, despite the signing of the GPA little progress  had
    been made in the protection and promotion of human rights in  Zimbabwe,
    as seen by the sustained levels of violence from month to month.   Some
    reports received by the Human Rights Forum indicated that ZANU-PF bases
    which were used as places to torture and maim supporters and  purported
    supporters  of  the  MDC  during  the  electoral  violence  were  still
    operational or reactivated.  Zimbabwe has a high level of violence  and
    patriarchal attitudes are extremely harsh on women.  According  to  the
    Girl Child Network, 40,000 girls are raped annually  before  they  turn
    17.  Rape is also reported to  be  used  as  a  political  weapon.   An
    estimated 25,000 people had been the victims of  human  rights  abuses,
    along with 200,000 displaced.  There was endemic torture, beatings  and
    murders.  Reports of human rights monitors  in  rural  areas  suggested
    that they were scared and witnessing escalating human rights abuses.

149.  Dr Kibble confirms the  report  of  Professor  Barnett  as  a  correct
    assessment of the situation in Zimbabwe.  Zimbabwe  Doctors  for  Human
    Rights apparently said that there was now only  one  doctor  for  every
    12,000 people (outside the private and NGO sectors).   Around  1  in  7
    adults living with HIV and an estimated 565 adults  and  children  were
    becoming infected every day.   He  was  told  by  a  Zimbabwean  social
    activist that those who qualified for it were  enrolled  in  the  state
    health protection for HIV and related conditions (which  were  assisted
    by international organisations  and  NGOs)  and  there  was  reasonably
    adequate care at little cost but that for those not within this  scheme
    and provision the  costs  of  private  medication  and  treatment  were
    astronomical.  It was currently estimated that about half of those  who
    qualified on the basis of their  medical  condition  to  receive  anti-
    retrovirals or another medication actually did  so,  therefore  200,000
    out  of  an  estimated  400,000.   Though  this  was   a   considerable
    improvement on the 15% or so who were receiving attention twelve months
    previously, it still left a very large backlog.  He considered  it  was
    very unlikely and difficult whether someone newly arriving back in  the
    country would immediately be able to  benefit  from  the  international
    agencies' assisted state processes and considered that at least  for  a
    time recourse would have to be made to private medicine with  its  very
    high costs.  Although medication would be available, unlike a year ago,
    for almost any conditions,  the  costs  would  be  likely  to  be  very
    prohibitive.  He did not think that returnees would  have  priority  in
    getting onto  the  register  of  eligible  people  for  state  provided
    medication.

150.  Dr Kibble goes on to say that there is  a  plethora  of  organisations
    and networks working on support,  advocacy  and  training  around  HIV,
    medication provision, care and  destigmatisation.   He  considers  that
    despite this, the coverage of service delivery  is  likely  to  improve
    only slowly because of the very slow recovery of the  national  economy
    and the fact that donor funds were extremely stretched at present.   He
    also considers that stigma and ostracisation due to HIV is  still  very
    problematic and debilitating, especially for people  lacking  extensive
    family support.  He considers social services support is likely  to  be
    entirely lacking and that there  would  be  no  likelihood  of  finding
    professional care except at great expense and likewise  hospitalisation
    or institutionalisation for care though now available  would  be  again
    prohibitively expensive.

151.  Dr Kibble goes on to note that Zimbabwe receives international aid  in
    this sector with the main donors being the UK and the US Department for
    International Development (DfID and USAID) and the European Commission.
     He considers that access, particularly to  anti-retroviral  drugs,  is
    still a major problem and that there has been a shortage  of  ARVs  for
    some years.  He refers to a report  in  October  2005  that  government
    officials who are HIV Positive are being given priority access to  ARVs
    and intercepting drugs for their own use that were actually  meant  for
    public hospitals.  Women who live in rural areas  purportedly  find  it
    very difficult to obtain ARVs and would have to travel  long  distances
    to health centres to receive  ARVs.   A  severe  national  shortage  of
    healthcare workers had led to long  waiting  lists  and  administration
    problems.  He goes on to  refer  to  the  difficulties  experienced  by
    people whose HIV mutates at speed and the different lines of  treatment
    which  become  necessary  as  a  consequence   and   the   increasingly
    complicated nature of the regime.  He says that  it  is  impossible  in
    Zimbabwe under current  circumstances  to  access  the  required  drugs
    except for those who can get help from the most sophisticated forms  of
    private medicine.  He considers that the health sector in Zimbabwe  had
    almost entirely collapsed, and that it is still on life support.

Dr Mujuru-Mvere

152.  Dr Naomi Mujuru-Mvere was a doctoral student of Professor  Barnett  at
    the University of East Anglia and  has  subsequently  been  part  of  a
    consultancy team contracted  by  the  United  Nations  Children's  Fund
    (UNICEF) and the Minister of Education of Zimbabwe on a field study  to
    establish the unit cost and co-financing modalities of basic  education
    in Zimbabwe, with special reference to those afflicted and affected  by
    HIV and AIDS.  She was in Zimbabwe between April and  June  2007,  when
    she visited a number of hospitals, clinics and  pharmacies,  and  again
    visited Zimbabwe between 20 November and  17  December  2008  and  most
    recently was in Zimbabwe between 18 November and 25 December 2009  when
    she again  visited  a  number  of  hospitals,  shops  and  clinics  and
    consulted  the  Zimbabwe  Medical  Research  Council  (ZMRC)  and   the
    University of Zimbabwe Clinical Research Centre (UZCRC).  Her report is
    dated 25 January 2010.

153.  Dr Mujuru-Mvere considered that the health issues of  BR,  in  respect
    of whom she was specifically asked to provide a report, were worse than
    her socioeconomic position in Zimbabwe.  She would  be  seen  as  being
    irresponsible, since her HIV was diagnosed after she entered the United
    Kingdom.  She says that the care system for chronically ill patients in
    Zimbabwe is still poor and worse for single old women, as she describes
    BR, who was born in 1957.  She will be isolated and  stigmatised  since
    in Zimbabwe nobody wants to be  near  a  person  who  is  known  to  be
    chronically ill,  especially  from  AIDS  and  that  the  Shona  tribal
    groupings to which she belongs are patrilineal  and  patrilocal,  hence
    entailing that women occupy a subordinate role and that this could mean
    that her nursing and care could be challenging.

154.  She says that  bribery  is  now  definitely  required  to  succeed  in
    acquiring many commodities or services, and  that  healthcare  workers,
    particularly those in the HIV/AIDS sector  are  being  singled  out  as
    being among groups  of  workers  that  are  greatly  profiteering  from
    corrupt practices.  Because of  the  difficulty  in  obtaining  foreign
    currency, BR will find it hard to buy food, and as a sick single  woman
    she will confront great  difficulty  in  accessing  food,  electricity,
    clean water and sanitation.  She says that the  situation  on  food  is
    problematic in urban areas including Chitungwiza, BR's home town.   She
    says that there is another looming food shortage.  She will  experience
    endless queuing for food and other commodities and may  experience  the
    need to pay fees for privileged positions or favours  within  a  queue.
    The current problematic water situation and food  issues  will  have  a
    serious impact on her health as a sick, diabetic, single woman.

155.  Dr Mujuru-Mvere says that it is still also a standard  requirement  at
    health centres for sick people on treatment to have  a  partner  within
    their household, someone who will be in a position to assist them with,
    for example, being a companion, encouraging them to  take  tablets  and
    help with other personal needs.  She notes that BR has no  such  person
    in Zimbabwe.  She says that she knows for certain that the majority  of
    people are unable to meet costs for any treatment which  requires  cash
    payment up front in foreign currency including the costs of  tests  and
    fees for consultation.  She said that, in any event, new patients  such
    as BR are not being accepted in the public  sector,  whilst  for  those
    already on the government scheme, supplies are still  intermittent  and
    subject to substitution.  She says that on her most  recent  visit  she
    observed that many public health institutions  had  reopened  including
    the main hospital in Harare, but they were still not operating normally
    and there were still shortages and waiting lists and queues  for  ARVs.
    She made enquiries from the Avenues Clinic pharmacy in Harare as to the
    availability of ARVs, and found that it had exactly the same  type  and
    number of ARVs as the other ordinary private pharmacies.  She says that
    a range of ARVs is sometimes available from some private  institutions,
    but they are not manufactured in Zimbabwe and  the  cost  of  importing
    them is high.  She concludes that  if  the  appellant  is  returned  to
    Zimbabwe, there is no hope that she will get the  help  she  needs  and
    that  also  her  complex  specialist  combination  HIV   treatment   is
    unavailable.  Dr Mujuru-Mvere notes the medical evidence concerning  BR
    and the fact that in Dr Minton's report of 11 January 2010 it had  been
    found necessary to change her anti-retroviral regimen in November  2009
    to a more complex one.  She had acquired resistance  to  certain  ARVs.
    She notes the specific ARVs that BR is now on, and says in  respect  of
    these that Raltegravir is not available from government institutions or
    private pharmacies, and nor are Atazanvir and Ritonavir.  The other ARV
    in the combination of therapy she receives is Truvada which she says is
    not  available  in  government  hospitals.   She  concludes  that   the
    appellant's combination ARV  treatment  is  now  more  complex  and  is
    unavailable in Zimbabwe.  In particular Raltegravir is a very new  form
    of treatment known as an integrase inhibitor which  has  only  recently
    come into widespread use in the UK NHS and is certainly  not  available
    in either the public or private sectors in Zimbabwe.  This chimes  with
    Professor Barnett's evidence respecting Raltegravir.

156.  Dr Mujuru-Mvere goes on to say that it will not  be  possible  for  BR
    simply to slot into the programme of treatment on arrival.  It has been
    reported that there are plans to expand the government's ARV programme.
     With regard  to  the  impact  of  government  policies  and  political
    considerations, Dr Mujuru-Mvere says  that  the  public  administrative
    structures have always  been  and  still  are  to  date  embedded  with
    powerful ZANU-PF politicians who tend to be militant and corrupt.   She
    says that these cadres are still there despite  the  formation  of  the
    "Unity" government.  She says  that  corruption  has  now  also  widely
    spread to all levels and sectors of the economy, including both  senior
    and junior civil servants.  The issue of political affiliation is still
    a significant issue  in  Zimbabwe  and  it  is  still  a  priority  for
    protection and for survival, and an  insurmountable  hurdle  for  those
    outside the structures with health issues.  She refers to  it  being  a
    problem as long  ago  as  July  2001  of  political  discrimination  in
    relation to the composition of the boards of the National AIDS  Council
    in Zimbabwe (NAC) and in relation to its distribution  of  funds/scarce
    resources.  She had also come across this during  her  fieldwork.   She
    says that it has always been policy that for  someone  to  access  free
    government treatment or other free handouts from government, there  has
    to be means testing at a local level and a letter of  support  written.
    To  get  this  letter  of  support  could  be   very   subjective   and
    discriminatory on political lines, increasing the vulnerability of  HIV
    sufferers compounded by the high levels of corruption.  She  says  that
    the Unity government's efforts to revive  the  economy  have  not  been
    successful and that the Unity government is broke.  She considers  that
    the power sharing agreement does not seem to be  making  any  immediate
    impact.  She concludes that the appellant's  removal  from  the  United
    Kingdom would include a real risk of deterioration  in  her  health  as
    there  is  no  realistic  prospect  whatsoever  of  her  accessing  the
    combination ARV treatment that she needs in Zimbabwe.

Dr Baggaley

157.  Dr Rachel Baggaley  has  written  a  report  dated  27  February  2007
    specific to the appellant EC.  She is a medical doctor and currently  a
    Head of the HIV Unit  at  Christian  Aid.   She  is  also  an  Honorary
    Research Fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical  Medicine.
    For the previous four years she had worked in London for Christian Aid,
    having previously lived and worked in Africa, specialising in  HIV  and
    counselling issues, and as part of her current work  she  continued  to
    travel to Africa to review projects and programmes having most recently
    been in Zimbabwe in May 2006.

158.  At the time of her report there were an estimated 1.7  million  people
    living with HIV in Zimbabwe.  Generic ARVs though licensed in  Zimbabwe
    were not currently widely available.  There was  a  very  limited  drug
    supply through government health services.  ARVs had  recently  started
    to become available through some government clinics,  but  as  yet  the
    programme was very small and very few people had access.  Though it was
    available, she says that people receiving ART had to have a letter from
    social welfare recommending free treatment.  According to colleagues in
    Harare, she said it is unlikely that anyone would  be  able  to  obtain
    this letter of support unless they were a card-carrying member of ZANU-
    PF.  If they had other political affiliations or were known  previously
    to have been members of  the  opposition  party,  it  would  be  highly
    unlikely that they would  be  supplied  with  the  necessary  paperwork
    needed for them to get free ART.  A recent  report  from  Human  Rights
    Watch also stated that access to ART  through  government  schemes  was
    "subjective and arbitrary" with "unnecessary obstacles  for  vulnerable
    and poor people living with HIV who urgently need access to healthcare,
    leaving them at risk of fatal deterioration in their health.  She deals
    also with the availability of ARVs from private  pharmacies  which  she
    says are sometimes available, the fact that CD4  counts  are  sometimes
    available in Harare, costing in the region of �40 and that  viral  load
    measurements were only available in some private health clinics,  at  a
    cost of approximately �100.  She says that unless the appellant EC  had
    access to foreign currency (a minimum of �949 per month) she would  not
    be able to access ART and would deteriorate quickly and die.  She  says
    that this is the cost of  the  drugs  alone  and  does  not  cover  the
    monitoring and clinical care  costs  which  would  double  the  overall
    costs.  She would die prematurely due to HIV but it was not possible to
    estimate the timescale of this, though it would be  compounded  by  the
    lack of basic healthcare now available in Zimbabwe.  She says that  HIV
    is still a hugely stigmatising condition in  Zimbabwe,  with  very  few
    people feeling able to be open about their positive  HIV  status.   She
    says that counselling services are available in Harare  but  women  are
    often reluctant to attend because  of  worries  about  confidentiality.
    The appellant said that she had not been able to disclose her situation
    to relatives and she might therefore experience feelings  of  isolation
    and this would be exacerbated if her clinical condition deteriorated.

Professor Ranger

159.  Professor Ranger's report  is  dated  24  February  2010.   He  is  an
    Emeritus Professor of the University of Oxford who also  gave  evidence
    in RN.  He was asked to provide a report in respect  of  the  appellant
    RS.  He makes no comment on the question of her HIV status  or  of  the
    availability of treatment in Zimbabwe as he says  that  he  is  not  an
    expert on AIDS and in any case it does not seem to him  that  her  case
    depends on the matter.  His report is therefore  essentially  addressed
    at the issue of risk on return for her if she is unable to  demonstrate
    support for ZANU-PF.  In effect he does not consider there  to  be  any
    material difference in the human rights situation in Zimbabwe since  he
    made his report to the AIT in RN's case.   He  notes  initial  optimism
    after the signing of the global political agreement but emphasises  the
    fact that  subsequent  human  rights  reports  and  political  violence
    reports have become more pessimistic thereafter.  He notes for  example
    the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum Political Violence Report  for  May
    2009, which states that the month of June saw the levels  of  organised
    violence sustained  with  little  indication  that  the  government  of
    national unity was committed to ending human rights violations  in  the
    country.  Student leaders had  been  arrested  and  groups  of  ZANU-PF
    youths had been harassing MDC supporters.  He quotes Human Rights Watch
    as stating on 12 February 2010 that no real progress had been  made  in
    ending human rights abuses a year after  the  formation  of  the  Unity
    government.  The African Director of Human Rights Watch  is  quoted  as
    saying that the government of national unity is a sham and that from  a
    human rights perspective nothing has changed for the  better.   Amnesty
    International on 11 February 2010 said through its Africa Director that
    the Attorney General's office, the police and the army  had  been  left
    free to violate human rights.  There was renewed violence on the ground
    and the situation could deteriorate if no urgent measures were taken to
    stop  state  security  agents  from  carrying  out  violent   political
    campaigns.  On 23 February the European Union announced that  it  would
    not lift sanctions on Zimbabwe,  finding  "insufficient  progress  with
    regard  to  the  rule  of  law,  respect  for  human  rights,  national
    reconciliation, security sector reform".  Professor Ranger concludes by
    saying that in  his  view  the  caution  expressed  in  RN  has  proved
    abundantly justified and should continue to be taken as  the  statement
    of the legal position.

Mr Jones

160.  Mr Jones, the First Secretary (Migration) of the  British  Embassy  in
    Harare has provided a report entitled  "The  availability  of  publicly
    funded anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and  drugs  in  Zimbabwe".   The
    terms of reference of this fact-finding mission  are  set  out  at  the
    start of his report.  It addresses such matters as the availability  of
    publicly  funded  anti-retroviral  treatment/drugs  in  Zimbabwe,   the
    criteria for access to such treatment/drugs, evidence of waiting  lists
    and  average  waiting  times,  the  cost  of  private   anti-retroviral
    treatment in Zimbabwe and access to it, the  prospects  of  remittances
    from the United Kingdom  feeding  through,  developing  a  view  as  to
    whether any shortages in medicines or limitations  in  healthcare  were
    the result of deliberate and  malign  government  "targeting",  whether
    there  was  evidence  of  preferential  access  to  public  or  private
    treatment and the criteria for such preferential treatment.   Mr  Jones
    consulted a number of organisations and individuals.

161.  After receiving the responses of the individuals  Mr  Jones  wrote  up
    the responses given and checked these back  with  the  individuals  and
    organisations in question, thus enabling him  to  provide  his  overall
    report.  Several organisations or  individuals  were  not  willing  for
    their names or identities to  be  provided  and  therefore  these  were
    redacted.  However, there are specific responses from the National AIDS
    Council, the World Health Organisation, the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society,
    the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights, and the  Ministry
    of Health and Child Welfare.   He  also  relied  on  various  published
    sources  including  uncorrected  written  evidence  submitted  by   the
    Department for International Development (DfID) to the House of Commons
    International Development Committee and the September  2009  Guidelines
    for  Anti-Retroviral  Therapy  in  Zimbabwe.   It  is  said  that   the
    individuals and organisations were chosen in order  to  give  the  best
    representation of the current situation in Zimbabwe due to their  level
    of involvement in and knowledge of the issues.

162.  There is set out a list of common anti-retroviral drugs  available  in
    Zimbabwe.  There were also  some  drugs  that  were  not  available  in
    Zimbabwe though it was said that some ARVs  not  found  in  the  public
    sector could be found in the private sector.   This  was  part  of  the
    response  from  the  World  Health  Organisation.   One  anonymous  aid
    organisation reported that there was at least one ART clinic in each of
    the 62 districts in Zimbabwe, but that patients often  had  trouble  in
    finding the money to pay for transport to the nearest clinic.  This was
    a more common issue for those living in more rural areas, though it was
    said by the National AIDS Council that the government had a  number  of
    outreach teams to address this issue.  The National AIDS  Council  said
    that in the past, although there was  better  access  to  treatment  in
    urban areas, there was also a longer waiting  time.   The  Global  Fund
    targeted support to more remote regions.  There is a table setting  out
    various districts in Zimbabwe which received  additional  ART  support.
    This  also  includes  an  indication  of  representation  in  terms  of
    Parliamentary seats after the 2008  elections  designed  to  give  more
    clarity to the issue of whether access to  treatment  is  dependent  on
    political motivation.  Mr Jones says that a total of 40  MDC  districts
    and 57 ZANU-PF districts benefited from additional support in  Round  5
    from the Global Fund.

163.  As regards the criteria for access to treatment/drugs  in  the  public
    sector, these are  set  out  in  the  "Guidelines  for  Anti-Retroviral
    Therapy in Zimbabwe".  It is said  by  the  World  Health  Organisation
    (WHO) in its response that new arrivals in Zimbabwe who are already  on
    treatment will be prioritised.  The National AIDS Council said that  if
    someone had already been initiated on treatment in another country they
    would not have to wait more than a month for treatment.   An  anonymous
    international organisation said that those who had already been  tested
    "should be able to  access  treatment  with  two  weeks  in  government
    hospitals and a few days in private institutions".  The WHO  said  that
    priority for treatment was currently given to children, pregnant women,
    health workers and their immediate families and all patients  who  meet
    the criteria set out in the National ART  Guidelines,  including  those
    already on ARV treatment (in order to avoid  development  of  HIV  drug
    resistance).  The WHO had said that some members of  the  diaspora  had
    already contacted them with enquiries about treatment  on  return,  and
    some had since returned.

164.  As regards stigma on return, it is said in the  report  that  a  large
    number of people in Zimbabwe are affected by AIDS or HIV and  that  the
    majority who are not directly affected have friends or family who  are.
    It is said, given the  level  of  infection  over  the  years  and  the
    sensitisation campaigns run by aid  organisations  and  governments  in
    Zimbabwe, that it is difficult to see  how  a  returnee  from  overseas
    would face any higher risk of stigma simply because they had  lived  in
    the United Kingdom.

165.  It is said in Mr Jones' report that by the  end  of  November  2009  a
    total of 215,123 people was receiving ART in  the  public  and  private
    sectors.  This figure, it is said, has gradually increased since  2004,
    and a chart is provided.  It is said that estimates for  waiting  times
    vary in part due to the fact  that  there  are  so  many  organisations
    involved in the process.  For example, M�decins Sans Fronti�res provide
    treatment exclusively in the Buhera district, and  also  have  AIDS/HIV
    programmes in other  places,  supporting  free  healthcare  for  40,000
    people.  It is said that  there  are  numerous  clinics  and  treatment
    centres run independently by various organisations.  The  World  Health
    Organisation stated that of the estimated 300 clinics in Zimbabwe,  100
    were involved in initialising  treatment,  with  200  concentrating  on
    follow-up treatment.  Current guidance  stated  that  whilst  a  person
    could only be initiated  on  anti-retroviral  treatment  by  a  doctor,
    follow up treatment in terms of supplies of drugs need only be  carried
    out by a nurse or other clinician.  The  waiting  time  for  access  to
    public treatment for those  not  deemed  to  be  priority  cases  could
    typically be up to six months, according to the WHO.

166.  There is then set out a list of available ARTs in Zimbabwe  and  their
    costs.  Mr Jones had visited a pharmacy in Harare on 11  February  2010
    which commonly supplied drugs to private patients on ARV which gave him
    a list of the drugs that they had in stock and their prices.

167.  On the question of whether there was  political  motivation  affecting
    shortages and availability, most respondents said that they had seen no
    evidence of the availability or otherwise of anti-retroviral  treatment
    being dependent on political affiliation.   All  of  those  interviewed
    said they were not aware of any issues around the withholding of  drugs
    by the government in MDC areas, and some said that it was difficult  to
    see how ZANU-PF would be able to orchestrate the withholding  of  drugs
    to particular areas, as they would not  have  access  to  the  relevant
    mechanisms, for example, as was said in an anonymous response, they had
    "no  control  over  procurement,  which  is   handled   by   NGOs   and
    international organisations etc".  The World Health Organisation simply
    replied "No" when asked whether the availability of ARVs was in any way
    dictated by political affiliation and whether  someone  would  have  to
    demonstrate loyalty to a political party to obtain ARVs.  On this issue
    the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society said that there was a  defined  referral
    system which did  not  discriminate  against  race,  gender,  political
    affiliation, religion etc.  The Zimbabwe  Association  of  Doctors  for
    Human Rights said that there had been some limited  anecdotal  evidence
    to suggest that the availability of ARVs might be dictated by political
    affiliation in some areas but insufficient to  support  this  view  and
    there was no suggestion that it was systematic or  policy-driven.   The
    Department for International Development had said with reference to its
    involvement in the Expanded Support  Programme  for  HIV  and  AIDS  in
    Zimbabwe (the ESP) that  "the  ESP  demonstrated  it  was  possible  to
    support national policy  and  public  services  without  passing  money
    through the government and  without  becoming  entangled  in  political
    debate".  There was reference also to one NGO  stating  that  they  had
    heard of food aid being withheld during the 2008 elections.

168.  Some of the interviewees stated that  in  terms  of  supply,  economic
    conditions were not necessarily  an  issue.   This,  according  to  the
    National AIDS Council, was because the majority of drugs (90%) used for
    ART in Zimbabwe were supplied by NGOs and  international  organisations
    and were therefore  imported,  bypassing  any  economic  issues  within
    Zimbabwe  itself.   It  is  said  in  the  report  that  a  number   of
    international organisations, governments  and  NGOs  provide  transport
    within the country to ensure drugs reach regional clinics and treatment
    centres.  Officially a patient can only be initiated on  ARV  treatment
    by a qualified doctor.  It is said by the WHO that drugs are  delivered
    to the regions every other month and that from the end of 2007  to  the
    date of interview there had been no reported shortages of ARVs from the
    national stores, although there were some in 2006 to 2007.  Where there
    were shortages, patients were provided with a shorter  supply  so  more
    patients could be treated.  It was said by the  National  AIDS  Council
    that drug shortages in regional clinics had sometimes also been  caused
    by a lack of a qualified person to order the drugs.

169.  As regards preferential access to public  or  private  treatment,  the
    WHO said that it had only heard limited anecdotal evidence that  people
    had attempted to use bribery to move up waiting lists  and  these  were
    apparently discovered by the authorities.  The  National  AIDS  Council
    said that there was no evidence of access to treatment being  dependent
    on political affiliation or corruption.  It is  said  that  local  AIDS
    committees would not have access to the initiating or treatment  system
    in any way that would enable  them  to  interfere  with  that  process,
    especially where the treatment in some areas is controlled by NGOs such
    as M�decins Sans Fronti�res.

170.  It is said that according to the 2009  HIV  estimates,  about  343,000
    people were in need of ART.  As at the  end  of  2009,  there  were  an
    estimated 1.1 million people living with  HIV  and  AIDS  in  Zimbabwe.
    According to the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare in  August  2009,
    approximately 128,000 eligible PLHIV  (people  living  with  HIV)  were
    currently waiting to be  started  on  ART  (across  all  public  health
    facilities in Zimbabwe).  This figure would increase, however,  if  the
    government adopted the  WHO  Guidelines  recommendation  that  patients
    start treatment at a CD4 count of 350 (the current threshold appears to
    be 200).

171.  It is noted that there is a significant  shortage  of  health  workers
    across Zimbabwe.  DfID has led on a process to ensure  the  return  and
    retention of health workers and they stated that:

        "By October 2008, health services were close to closure, with  many
        hospitals physically closed.   A  retention  scheme  enabled  these
        facilities to reopen in January, and by  February  2009  they  were
        almost fully functional."

      This is to be found in the uncorrected written evidence  submitted  by
    the Department for International Development of the  House  of  Commons
    International Development Committee set out at Annex K to  the  report.
    Government figures show an estimated (AIDS related) mortality rate  for
    both adults and children combined of 92,379 in 2007,  79,572  in  2008,
    and 66,073 in 2009.  This is said to be a consequence of  upscaled  ART
    programmes.

172.  As regards treatment guidelines and CD4 count testing, it  seems  that
    most people started on treatment in Zimbabwe had  CD4  counts  of  less
    than 200.  As noted above, Zimbabwe has not yet  adopted  the  new  WHO
    treatment guidelines, though it is currently reviewing the new guidance
    and considering options.  There are currently pharmaceutical  companies
    in Zimbabwe which have the capacity and potential to manufacture  ARVs,
    according to the WHO.

173.  As regards food security, harvests and  malnutrition,  hyper-inflation
    and acute shortages of  basic  supplies  and  a  series  of  very  poor
    harvests led to serious food shortages and acute insecurity  in  recent
    years.  This has necessitated large-scale humanitarian food  assistance
    operations in Zimbabwe.  The country faces a cereal shortfall of around
    677,000 tonnes during the current consumption year which ends in  March
    2010, despite a significantly improved harvest of maize in the previous
    year.  It is estimated  that  around  2.8  million  people  might  need
    humanitarian assistance before the harvest  in  April  2010,  with  the
    majority in rural areas.  The World Food programme is aiming to  assist
    almost 1.5 million Zimbabweans per month during the  first  quarter  of
    2010 through Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) and other social safety net
    programmes and has identified with its  cooperating  partners  a  three
    tier strategy to prioritise food assistance interventions.

Dr Day

174.  There are  two  medical  reports  from  Dr  John  Day  respecting  the
    appellant EC.  The first of these is dated 16 February 2007.   She  had
    been under the care of his department  since  February  2002  when  she
    presented with recurrent genital herpes and a routine test for HIV  was
    found to be positive.  She was commenced on anti-retroviral therapy  on
    4 March 2002 and had made an excellent response.  Her most  recent  CD4
    count on 3 January 2007 was 470 and her HIV viral load had  been  fully
    suppressed since June 2003, indicating her excellent adherence  to  the
    medication.  Dr Day has had eleven years' experience of working in  HIV
    medicine in the UK, Zimbabwe and South Africa.  He noted that  both  of
    the drugs the appellant was on at that  time,  Efavirenz  and  Combivir
    were available in the private sector at high cost in Zimbabwe and  that
    availability of anti-retroviral therapy was very limited in the  public
    sector and primarily reserved for those who  were  symptomatic.   There
    were cheaper alternatives to Efavirenz  and  Combivir  which  would  be
    suitable for the appellant but would be more  likely  to  produce  side
    effects.  The supply was prone to interruptions.  HIV remained a highly
    stigmatised condition in Zimbabwe and patients with HIV were subject to
    persecution and prejudice.  With no or limited  access  to  medication,
    she would inevitably become ill, lose weight and die.

175.  In his recent report of 12 February 2010, Dr Day refers  to  the  fact
    that the appellant has remained on Efavirenz and Combivir and her  last
    test on 9 October 2009 showed a CD4 count of  597.   On  27  April  her
    regime was simplified from Efavirenz  and  Combivir  to  Atripla.   Her
    future health was dependent on her continuing to be able to receive  an
    uninterrupted supply of anti-retrovirals.  She had not had a viral load
    resistance test carried out before commencing treatment as it  was  not
    part of the clinic routine at the time, but it was likely that she  had
    no resistance mutations and therefore alternative drug regimes would be
    expected to be effective.  If she were to receive  an  erratic  supply,
    she would be at  risk  of  developing  resistant  strains  which  would
    necessitate change of treatment to a more complex, more  expensive  and
    hence less available combination.  If  she  was  unable  to  receive  a
    supply that fully controlled her virus then her life  expectancy  would
    be limited to less than three years as a consequence of a deterioration
    in her immune function predisposing her  to  opportunistic  infections.
    That risk would be exacerbated by  inadequate  nutrition,  particularly
    with respect to tuberculosis which remained the commonest opportunistic
    infection for people living with HIV infection in Southern Africa,   Dr
    Day said that he does not have recent  first  hand  experience  of  the
    availability of anti-retroviral therapy in Zimbabwe.

Dr Minton

176.  As regards the appellant BR, there are a  number  of  medical  reports
    dating back to 13 August 2002, the most recent being 11  January  2010.
    That is a report from Dr Minton.  He says that the  appellant,  despite
    being on HIV treatment, had a persistently raised  HIV  viral  load  in
    September and October 2009 and they therefore  carried  out  resistance
    studies.  This showed that she had unfortunately acquired resistance to
    the two main classes of HIV  medication  commonly  used,  i.e.  reverse
    transcriptase  inhibitors  including  Lamivudine   and   non-nucleotide
    reverse transcriptase inhibitors, particularly  Efavirenz.   Her  anti-
    retroviral regimen was therefore changed in November  2009  to  a  more
    complex  one  consisting  of  Raltegravir,  Atazanavir,  Ritonavir  and
    Truvada.  He says that she has  tolerated  this  regimen  well  and  is
    pleased to say that her HIV viral  load  was  not  detected  when  last
    checked on 29 December 2009.  Her CD4 count was reasonable at 388.  His
    understanding was that  these  second  line  anti-retroviral  medicines
    would be very hard to obtain in Zimbabwe.

Dr Day

177.  In respect of the appellant RS there are two reports,  again  from  Dr
    Day.  The first of these is dated 7 August 2008.  RS was  commenced  on
    Combivir and Nelfinavir on 30 August 2001.  Nelfinavir was withdrawn as
    a result of safety concerns on 2 June 2007  and  she  was  switched  to
    other drugs.  Unfortunately blood tests showed a suboptimal control  of
    her HIV on this combination, and an HIV resistance test  confirmed  the
    resistant strains necessitating  another  change  on  9  July  2008  to
    Tenofivir and Zidovudine and Efavirenz.  He says  that  her  prognosis,
    provided she continued to receive medication, was excellent but if  she
    was unable to receive an uninterrupted supply  of  treatment  he  would
    expect her life expectancy to be less than five years.   He  says  that
    the development of resistant strains also restricts the  repertoire  of
    HIV medication she may require in  the  future.   The  combination  she
    currently takes is also active against hepatitis B of which she  is  an
    asymptomatic carrier and there is a small risk  that  she  may  develop
    complications due to reactivation of the hepatitis B virus.

178.  Dr Day's most recent report is dated 4 February  2010.   RS  continues
    to receive treatment for HIV on the basis of the three drugs  to  which
    she changed on 9 July  2008.   On  this  she  has  maintained  a  fully
    suppressed HIV viral load of  less  than  50  copies/ML  and  a  stable
    healthy CD4 count of over 500.  Her latest CD4 count on 1 February 2010
    was 623.  When she was last reviewed by the hepatologist  on  26  March
    2009, he confirmed that she remains a low  grade  hepatitis  B  chronic
    carrier at very low risk of future  complications.   Dr  Day  considers
    that, provided she is able to  continue  to  receive  an  uninterrupted
    supply of anti-retroviral therapy, he would anticipate  a  near  normal
    life  expectancy  and  good  health.   If  she  experienced   treatment
    interruptions, her risk of developing further viral resistant mutations
    would limit treatment options necessitating more medication with likely
    greater side effects and escalating cost.  If  medication  was  stopped
    completely he would expect her life expectancy to  be  less  than  five
    years.

Overview of the Other Background Evidence

179.  There is a good deal of other background evidence provided  on  behalf
    of the appellants relating to the issues in this case.  We  cannot  set
    it all out in detail, so an overview must suffice. Thus, in the context
    of evidence concerning the collapse of the public  health  sector,  the
    appellants rely on a report from Physicians for Human Rights of January
    2009. This states among other things that the  health  and  nutritional
    status of Zimbabwe's people has acutely worsened in the past  year  due
    to a raging cholera epidemic, high  maternal  mortality,  malnutrition,
    HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and now anthrax.  It is said that the health and
    healthcare crisis in Zimbabwe is a direct outcome of the abrogation  of
    a number of  human  rights,  including  the  right  to  participate  in
    government and in free elections and the right to a standard of  living
    adequate for one's health and wellbeing, including food,  medical  care
    and necessary social services.  The report says that  the  collapse  of
    Zimbabwe's health system in 2008 is unprecedented in scale  and  scope.
    The current status of healthcare in Zimbabwe is best understood, it  is
    said, as an  overall  health  system  collapse.   The  public  sector's
    hospitals have been shut since November  2008.   As  of  December  2008
    there were no functioning critical care beds in the  public  sector  in
    Zimbabwe.  Transport costs, even within Harare  proper,  had  made  the
    simple act of getting to work impossible for many healthcare employees.
     There were similar problems for would-be patients.

180.  This state of affairs  is  effectively  confirmed  in  a  report  from
    M�decins Sans Fronti�res of  February  2009.   They  refer  also  to  a
    widespread shortage of basic medical  material  such  as  syringes  and
    gloves, and also drugs.  It is said that there are few doctors left  in
    Zimbabwe and nurses are not allowed to initiate treatment.

181.  In a further report of June 2009 of M�decins  Sans  Fronti�res  it  is
    said that 7 million out of the remaining population of  9  million  are
    presently food insecure.  It is said that, though some speculated  that
    the establishment of a government of national unity  in  February  2009
    had "normalised" the situation in Zimbabwe, the political and  economic
    situation was far from stable and the health system continued to  exist
    in a state of near collapse and  as  a  consequence  Zimbabweans  would
    continue to flee to  South  Africa  in  desperation.   Further  similar
    concerns are expressed in a Zimonline report of 23 September  2009  and
    The Zimbabwean of October 2009.

182.  The Lancet on 13 October 2009 also referred to  the  ongoing  problems
    in the healthcare system and otherwise in Zimbabwe.   The  report  said
    that  many  believe  that  tangible   universal   health   and   social
    improvements would only follow radical change to the current  political
    dispensation.  It was  said  that  recent  South  African  humanitarian
    assistance worth USD$30 million which was meant for agriculture imports
    went mainly to areas loyal to ZANU-PF.

183.  On the FCO website  on  9  February  2010  there  is  reference  to  a
    shortage of drugs and trained medical  staff  in  hospitals  making  it
    difficult for hospitals to treat certain illnesses including  accidents
    and trauma cases.  It is said that  the  state  healthcare  system  was
    gradually improving, but it could not always be relied upon to  provide
    basic treatment,  and  standards  of  nursing  care,  even  in  private
    hospitals,  varied.   If  payment  was  available,  some  of  the  best
    hospitals were often too full to admit patients.

184.  With regard to access to treatment for HIV/AIDS,  the  Physicians  for
    Human Rights  report  of  January  2009  referred  to  food  insecurity
    experienced by a focus group of fifteen HIV Positive  urban  women.   A
    former  Ministry  of  Health  official  and  current  mission  hospital
    administrator reported that some HIV/AIDS patients were  selling  their
    ARV medications to receive money to buy  food.   Patients  living  with
    HIV/AIDS were especially vulnerable as a  result  of  food  insecurity.
    The most severe threat for HIV/AIDS was the interruption of supplies of
    anti-retroviral drugs.   This  had  occurred  due  to  a  breakdown  in
    delivery, distribution and theft of ARV drugs  by  ZANU-PF  operatives.
    Most  troubling  were  reports  that  some  physicians  were  switching
    patients on established ARV regimens to other  regimens  based  not  on
    clinical need, but on drug availability.  This  clearly  increased  the
    risk of HIV drug resistance and drug complications and side effects and
    constituted a significant threat to public health.

185.  A further report, AVERT, HIV and AIDS in Zimbabwe, 2009,  also  refers
    to the shortage of anti-retroviral drugs and also in October 2005 to  a
    quadrupling in the cost of anti-retroviral drugs in the previous  three
    months.  An article published in  2006  had  reported  that  government
    officials who were HIV Positive had been given priority access  to  the
    drugs, and while doing so they had intercepted drugs for their own  use
    which were actually meant for public hospitals.   A  Voice  of  America
    report of 14 August 2009 refers to the inaccessibility of healthcare in
    Zimbabwe for the  majority  of  the  population  due  to  the  official
    introduction of the use of  foreign  currency  and  the  death  of  the
    Zimbabwe dollar.  The Lancet report of 13 October 2009 states that anti-
    retroviral treatment coverage at 17% is the lowest of  any  country  in
    Southern Africa, and external funding contributes  some  21%  of  total
    health spending, a low proportion compared with that  in  most  African
    countries.

186.  With regard to the  politicisation  of  treatment  and  discrimination
    against HIV sufferers, a report of the Zimbabwe Daily  of  2  May  2007
    states that cabinet ministers and ZANU-PF bigwigs are now  topping  the
    list of beneficiaries of the government ARV therapy scheme.   There  is
    reference in the AVERT report to high stigmatisation of  HIV  and  AIDS
    sufferers, despite a high level of awareness.  The Physicians for Human
    Rights report refers to the plundering by ZANU-PF government  officials
    of USD$7.3 million in humanitarian aid for HIV/AIDS treatment, part  of
    USD$12.3 million provided by the Global Fund which was returned to  the
    Global Fund following public outrage.  There is reference to an article
    by the Chawapiwa Youth Organisation that government officials  who  are
    HIV Positive had been given (by the  National  AIDS  Council)  priority
    access to ARVs and while doing so they intercepted generic  AIDS  drugs
    for their own use which were actually meant for public hospitals.  This
    may be a further reference to the incident referred  to  in  the  AVERT
    article in 2006.  An article in The Zimbabwe Metro of  23  August  2009
    states that most  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  AIDS  levy  are  top
    government officials, mostly ministers and their  relatives.   An  IRIN
    article of 14 September 2009  refers  to  the  Zimbabwe  National  AIDS
    Council (the NAC) purchasing USD$890,000 worth of ARV  drugs  following
    allegations that it was abusing funds generated by a 3% tax  on  income
    known as the AIDS levy.  The NAC had constantly  come  under  fire  for
    failing to use the fund to improve the welfare of  people  living  with
    HIV, and several recent reports in the local media allege that most  of
    the money was being spent on salaries and perks.

187.  As regards the issue of politicisation of  food,  the  Physicians  for
    Human Rights' report of January 2009 says that the  Mugabe  regime  has
    been accused of using donor food aid as a tool to manipulate  elections
    by providing food to communities that  supported  ZANU-PF  and  denying
    food aid to communities that did not.  It says that this policy  became
    severe in around 2000  and  was  still  used  during  the  recent  2008
    elections.  It is said  that  this  restriction  of  food  became  most
    blatant in June to August 2008 when the Mugabe  government  banned  all
    charitable organisations from distributing food.  A Zimonline report of
    5 October 2009 states that hundreds of hungry Zimbabwean villagers  are
    being denied food handouts and forced to denounce their own parties  in
    return for assistance as marauding ZANU-PF militants continue to wage a
    war of attrition against perceived political enemies.  A Zimbabwe Peace
    Project (ZPP) report  of  September  2008  stated  that  of  the  1,335
    incidents of political violations recorded during the  month  of  July,
    some 37% were of people harassed, intimidated or  physically  assaulted
    while trying to access food assistance.  The report says that incidents
    of  harassment,  discrimination  and  violence  continue  to  halt  the
    distribution of humanitarian and food  assistance.   It  is  said  that
    about 42% of the cases involve discrimination in areas relating to food
    relief, government subsidised food, tillage support, input distribution
    and medical treatment, while 42% were harassments  involving  incidents
    in which people were forced to chant slogans, denounce  their  parties,
    attend political meetings and produce party cards.

188.  A report entitled Zimbabwe Democracy Now,  New  Year  2010,  dated  16
    January 2010, says that gangs of ZANU-PF activists move  from  ward  to
    ward stating that for people to receive food aid they will be  required
    to produce ZANU-PF membership cards.  A Zimbabwe Telegraph report of 14
    February 2010 states that the Minister  of  Agriculture  has  announced
    that the  government  has  banned  food  handouts  by  non-governmental
    organisations.  It says that if the past programmes of ZANU-PF are  the
    barometer a ZANU-PF card and voter registration card are  prerequisites
    for food aid.  A ZimDaily report of 16 February 2010  refers  to  Prime
    Minister Tsvangirai having been told  of  how  ZANU-PF  officials  have
    taken control of food aid from local NGOs and distributed  it  only  to
    ZANU-PF members.

189.  As regards the current political climate, a report in  the  Zimbabwean
    of 26 February 2010 refers to militant supporters of  President  Mugabe
    having set up torture camps in some parts of Zimbabwe and stepped up  a
    campaign  to  intimidate  villages  to  back  a   controversial   draft
    constitution.  Amnesty International were reported on 24 February  2010
    as having called on the government of Zimbabwe to  end  the  harassment
    and intimidation of a  union  activist  who  was  in  hiding.   Amnesty
    International  had  documented  consistent  politicised  and   partisan
    policing by members of the Zimbabwe Republic Police, in particular  the
    law and order section, aimed at silencing the voices  of  human  rights
    defenders.  There is an uncorrected transcript of oral evidence  before
    the House of Commons International Development Committee of 23 February
    2010 at which Mr Gareth Thomas MP, Minister of State at the  Department
    of International Development was quoted as saying that there  had  been
    an improvement in the delivery of basic services, but having said that,
    there were huge challenges still in terms  of  the  delivery  of  those
    services.  The crisis in terms of access to  healthcare  had  not  gone
    away, albeit that there were more health  workers  in  place.   It  was
    difficult to see how free and fair elections could take  place  in  the
    short term, and the government view was that what was included  in  the
    global political agreement in terms of changes that were  going  to  be
    needed had not happened as yet.

190.  A report in the Economist of 18 February 2010 states  that  after  the
    relative  optimism  of  last  year,  the  situation  in  Zimbabwe   was
    deteriorating badly.  The one year old "government of  national  unity"
    was described as being as good as dead.  Schools, hospitals, courts and
    other state services have been brought to  a  halt  by  striking  civil
    servants.  Though  there  had  been  an  improvement  in  the  economic
    situation and the reopening of schools and hospitals, it was considered
    that this had more to do with the replacement of  Zimbabwe's  worthless
    currency by the dollar, which happened before the Unity government  was
    set up.  Apart from the economy, the situation on the ground had hardly
    changed at all.  According to Amnesty International, in a report of  10
    February 2010, the abuse of human rights in  Zimbabwe  continued  under
    the unity government.  Villagers in  parts  of  Zimbabwe  had  suffered
    ceaseless intimidation by supporters  of  ZANU-PF.   The  Human  Rights
    Watch Report of 12 February 2010 confirms the  pessimism  expressed  in
    the Amnesty International Report about lack of progress in implementing
    political reforms and in respect of human rights  abuses  in  Zimbabwe.
    Recent research by Human Rights Watch in Zimbabwe suggested that  there
    had been no meaningful political transition, and ZANU-PF  continued  to
    engage in political violence against perceived opponents.   In  written
    evidence submitted by the Department for International Development to a
    House of Commons International Development Committee, in January  2010,
    it was  said  that  in  theory  the  Zimbabwean  national  constitution
    guaranteed many basic human rights,  but  the  state  had  consistently
    failed to protect citizens.  Widespread  repression  and  human  rights
    abuses seen at the time of the 2008 elections had decreased  under  the
    inclusive government, but arrests of trade unionists and civil  society
    activists,  land  invasions  and  politically  motivated  legal  action
    against parliamentarians had  continued,  with  weak  and  inconsistent
    responses from the judiciary.  It was said that the political situation
    remained volatile and unpredictable and the tipping point had  not  yet
    been reached.

191.  As regards the issue of government corruption, there is of course  the
    example we have quoted above of the misuse by the  Zimbabwe  government
    of USD$7.3 million of its USD$12.3 million grant from the Global  Fund,
    which had to be repaid.  The US State Department Report of  25  January
    2009 states that  the  government  did  not  implement  the  law  which
    provides criminal penalties for  official  corruption  effectively  and
    impartially, and officials frequently engaged in corrupt practices with
    impunity.  The same report, dealing with the issue of the operation  of
    NGOs, noted that a number of domestic and  international  human  rights
    groups operating in Zimbabwe were subject to  government  restrictions,
    interference, monitoring and harassment.  The government  continued  to
    obstruct the  activities  of  organisations  involved  in  humanitarian
    activities, particularly in rural  areas.   The  government  restricted
    feeding programmes and blocked efforts by local and international  NGOs
    to  provide  humanitarian  relief  to  those  affected   by   Operation
    Murambatsvina.  Following the March 29 election, NGOs and  humanitarian
    organisations were increasingly denied access by a variety of  official
    and unofficial personnel acting on behalf of the government.  There was
    harassment of representatives  of  international  NGOs.   There  was  a
    suspension of NGO "field operations" on June 5, and this  lasted  until
    August 29, when organisations were allowed to  renew  their  activities
    but were compelled to adhere to new reporting requirements to  maintain
    valid NGO registrations with the Ministry.

192.  There is reference in the Zimbabwean of 26 February 2010  to  HIV/AIDS
    activists  accusing  government  health  officials  of  looting   anti-
    retroviral drugs supplied by international donor groups for sale on the
    black  market.   It  is  also  said  by  several  activists  that  some
    politicians, especially from remote areas, were demanding HIV  Positive
    people to support them or  their  political  parties  in  exchange  for
    letters confirming they were in need of ARVs.  It is said that in  some
    remote rural communities, parliamentarians and councillors are required
    to write letters confirming that a sick person is too  poor  to  afford
    ARVs in order that they can get free drugs supplied by donors,  but  in
    many cases the politicians demand that  the  HIV  Positive  person  and
    their family promise to vote for them in future elections  in  exchange
    for the letter.  It has also been said that aid agencies  operating  in
    Zimbabwe have been urged to take ARVs directly to people with  HIV/AIDS
    amid allegations that some state officials involved in the distribution
    system were corrupt.  The Zimbabwe Peace Project is  quoted  as  saying
    that  party  affiliation  continues  to  determine  one's  chances   of
    accessing both government subsidised food and humanitarian  assistance.
    It is said that the procedure is that HIV/AIDS and TB patients who want
    to be registered for NGO relief assistance have to register first  with
    village health workers who are required to sign  the  form  which  they
    submit to NGO relief officers.  It is said that  these  well  laid  out
    procedures have been politicised by ordering intending beneficiaries to
    go and register first with the ZANU-PF district chairpersons who  would
    in turn authorise the village health workers to  register  the  patient
    for relief assistance.  Examples of this are  given  for  a  number  of
    areas of Zimbabwe.  It is said that most volunteers, healthcare givers,
    and ward coordinators in these districts allegedly report  directly  to
    ZANU-PF officials.  It is said that those targeted  are  systematically
    denied  access  by  government  officials,  who  are   mostly   ZANU-PF
    functionaries refusing to sign letters authorising victims medical  and
    other forms of assistance.

193.  On behalf of the Secretary of State again a good deal of  material  is
    provided and we can do no more than summarise that material.  Paragraph
    2.13 of the OGN for Zimbabwe of 24 March  2009  refers  to  reports  of
    political violence continuing, if not on the scale  of  April  to  June
    2008, and that suppression of peaceful protests  is  still  the  normal
    pattern.  The Human Rights Watch Report of August 2009 states  that  to
    its  credit,  the  power-sharing  government  has  managed,  with   the
    assistance  of  international  donors  and  aid  agencies,   to   bring
    Zimbabwe's serious  humanitarian  crisis  under  control  and  somewhat
    stabilise the country's economic  situation  through  a  range  of  new
    policies.  The report disclosed no ongoing violence  directed  at  non-
    activists.

194.  In the December 2009 COIR, account was taken of the  Solidarity  Peace
    Trust and  IRIN's  conclusions,  which  reported  that  the  levels  of
    violence against members of the MDC had reduced since  2008,  but  that
    there had been a sharp increase within days of  the  party  disengaging
    from the Unity  government  in  October  2009.   Cooperation  with  the
    government of national unity was resumed on 27 November  2009.   It  is
    noted that while there had been an increase in violence during the last
    few months of 2009, the levels of violence recorded for the first  half
    of that year were much reduced in comparison to the same period in 2008
    and 2007, and it is suggested that there is no basis for  the  argument
    that violence has reached the scale witnessed during 2008.  A  Ministry
    of Healing has been established.  Very  few  indications  of  political
    violence were found in the two provinces monitored  by  the  Solidarity
    Peace Trust in its report of June 2009.

195.  There is a response, dated 25 February 2010, from the First  Secretary
    (Migration) of the British Embassy Harare to Dr Kibble's report.  It is
    said that Zimbabwe in 2010 is  markedly  better  off  economically  and
    politically than it was in 2008 for example.  The  symbolic  importance
    of the fact that Mr Mugabe has been forced to share power  and  ZANU-PF
    no longer has a majority in the House of Assembly is emphasised.  It is
    also noted that there is enough optimism among MDC-T and its supporters
    for them to want to carry  on  in  government.   Issue  is  taken  with
    specific points in Dr Kibble's report, with reference to  such  matters
    as the low, almost non-existent inflation, and  rising  GDP,  the  fact
    that most vegetables are local and serious efforts are  being  made  to
    improve economic management.  As regards Professor Ranger's report,  it
    is said that there is little doubt that as far as human  rights  abuses
    are concerned, the situation on the ground in Zimbabwe in February 2010
    is better than at any time during 2008, where election related violence
    was well catalogued.  While there had been cases of  abuse,  these  had
    not been at the high level  seen  previously.   It  is  said  that  the
    political situation is positive in the sense that former opponents  are
    still together in the inclusive government.

Discussion

196.  We must now assess the evidence that we have  set  out  above  in  the
    context of the relevant legal principles, in relation to the  issue  of
    risk  on  return  to  Zimbabwe  for  persons  who  are  HIV   Positive.
    Thereafter we will apply our findings to the specific circumstances  of
    the three appellants.

The Current Country Guidance in RN

197.  It was agreed prior to the hearing of these appeals  that  they  would
    be concerned with risk to the  appellants  on  return  to  Zimbabwe  on
    account of their HIV/AIDS diagnoses, and it was not understood that the
    country guidance decision in RN would be  revisited.   Nevertheless  it
    was argued on behalf of the Secretary of State that it was  appropriate
    to revisit RN, and reference  is  made  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    skeleton argument and elsewhere to background evidence postdating RN in
    this regard.

198.  The suggestion that RN should be revisited was vigorously resisted  on
    behalf of the appellants, in light of the  pre-hearing  agreement,  but
    nevertheless some evidence was put in and  submissions  made  regarding
    the status of RN as country guidance and emphasising the point that  RN
    remains in effect binding country guidance unless very clear and cogent
    reasons are given for departing from it.  The point is made that if the
    appeals had been listed as general country guidance then a good deal of
    evidence would have been provided on behalf of the appellants.

199.  We do not propose to dwell on this issue.  The status  of  RN  as  the
    relevant country guidance is not a substantive issue before us, and  we
    understand that it is likely that later this year RN will be revisited.
     In any event such evidence as we have before us to the extent that  we
    have considered it appropriate to give consideration to  it,  indicates
    sufficiently clearly to our view,  and  bearing  in  mind  that  it  is
    limited evidence only, that there is no reason to depart from RN as the
    country guidance that should lie behind our decision insofar as  it  is
    relevant to do so.  Matters such as the State Department Report  of  11
    March 2010,  and  the  report  of  Professor  Ranger,  indicate  to  us
    sufficiently clearly, that  bearing  in  mind  the  terms  of  Practice
    Statement 12, we have not been provided with  the  kind  of  clear  and
    cogent reasons which seem to us  to  be  required  in  cases  involving
    issues relating to  aspects  of  country  conditions  as  a  whole  for
    departing from RN as country guidance.  It remains therefore very  much
    of significance in this case  as  background  (and  in  some  cases  as
    foreground) to the issues that we must consider.

Article 3 of the Human Rights Convention

200.  As can be seen from the case law we  have  summarised  above,  a  high
    threshold is set in cases where it is contended that  a  person  should
    not be removed from the host state to their country of  nationality  on
    the basis of their state of health where it  is  alleged  that  removal
    would amount to a breach of Article 3.  The  European  Court  of  Human
    Rights in D emphasised the very exceptional circumstances of  the  case
    and the compelling humanitarian considerations at stake.  The applicant
    in that case was in the advanced stages of  a  terminal  and  incurable
    illness, and the limited quality of life he enjoyed resulted  from  the
    availability of sophisticated treatment and medication  in  the  United
    Kingdom  and  the  care  and  kindness  administered  by  a  charitable
    organisation.  He had formed bonds  with  his  carers.   There  was  no
    evidence to show that he would benefit from any moral or social support
    when returned to St Kitts and nor had it been shown that  he  would  be
    guaranteed a bed in either of the hospitals on the island.  It was also
    noted that the United Kingdom had assumed responsibility  for  treating
    his condition.  It could not be said that the  conditions  which  would
    confront him in St Kitts would themselves cause a breach of  Article  3
    but his removal would expose him to a real risk  of  dying  under  most
    distressing circumstances and would thus amount to inhuman treatment.

201.  It is relevant to note  that  in  the  years  between  D  and  N,  the
    decision to which we shall come shortly, no further  cases  were  found
    where proposed removal of  an  alien  was  found  to  give  rise  to  a
    violation of Article 3 on grounds of the applicant's ill health.  BB  v
    France, as we have noted, was resolved  on  the  basis  of  a  friendly
    settlement.  In the meantime there are other decisions  in  Karara  and
    Henao, to which we have referred above, where applications relating  to
    people whose illness had not yet reached an advanced or terminal  stage
    were held to be inadmissible.

202.  In N,  at  paragraph  42,  the  Court  reminded  itself  of  the  very
    exceptional circumstances that existed in the case of D.   It  did  not
    exclude that there might be other  very  exceptional  cases  where  the
    humanitarian considerations were equally compelling but  considered  it
    should maintain the high threshold set in D and applied  in  subsequent
    case law.  The applicant in N, as  noted  at  paragraph  47,  had  been
    diagnosed in 1998 as having two AIDS  defining  illnesses  and  a  high
    level of immunosuppression.  Her condition was now stable as  a  result
    of the treatment she had received in the United Kingdom.  She  was  fit
    to travel and would remain fit as long as she continued to receive  the
    basic treatment she needed.  The evidence  before  the  United  Kingdom
    courts was that if she were to be deprived of  her  present  medication
    her condition would  rapidly  deteriorate  and  she  would  suffer  ill
    health, discomfort, pain and death within a few years.   It  was  noted
    that  anti-retroviral  medication  was  available  in  Uganda  although
    through lack of resources it was received by  only  half  of  those  in
    need.  The applicant claimed that she would be  unable  to  afford  the
    treatment and it would not be available to her in the rural  area  from
    which she came.  It appeared that she had  family  members  in  Uganda,
    though she said they would not be willing or able to care  for  her  if
    she were seriously ill.  She had been provided with medical and  social
    assistance at public expense during the nine year period it  had  taken
    for her asylum application and the human rights claim to be  determined
    by the domestic courts and the Court of  Human  Rights.   It  was  said
    however at paragraph 49 that this did not in itself entail  a  duty  on
    the part of the respondent state to continue so  to  provide  for  her.
    The Court accepted that the quality of her life and her life expectancy
    would be affected if she were returned to Uganda.  She was not  however
    at the present time critically ill.  The rapidity of the  deterioration
    which she would suffer and the extent to which she  would  be  able  to
    obtain access to medical treatment, support and  care,  including  help
    from relatives,  had  to  involve  a  certain  degree  of  speculation,
    particularly in view of the constantly evolving  situation  as  regards
    the treatment of HIV and AIDS worldwide.  The  Court's  conclusion  was
    that the applicant's case could not be distinguished from cases it  had
    cited earlier such as  Karara  and  Henao  and  Bensaid.   It  did  not
    disclose the very exceptional circumstances required to be shown as had
    existed, for example, in D.

203.  We have set out the medical evidence concerning the  three  appellants
    above.  To summarise it, the  current  situation  of  RS  is  that  she
    continues to receive treatment for HIV with Tenofovir,  Zidovudine  and
    Efavirenz.  Her most recent CD4 count was 623.   She  is  a  low  grade
    hepatitis B chronic carrier at very low risk of  future  complications.
    She is able to continue to receive an  uninterrupted  supply  of  anti-
    retroviral therapy and nearly normal life expectancy  and  good  health
    are expected.  If there are treatment interruptions  then  there  is  a
    risk of developing further viral resistant mutations which would  limit
    treatment options necessitating more  medication  with  likely  greater
    side  effects  and  escalating  cost.   If  medication   were   stopped
    completely her life expectancy would be less than five years.   BR  has
    had to be placed on  a  complex  regimen  of  treatment  consisting  of
    Raltegravir, Atazanavir, Ritonavir  and  Truvada.   Her  CD4  count  is
    reasonable at 388.  There is no projected life expectancy without  such
    treatment in the most recent report of Dr Minton of  11  January  2010,
    but in his previous report  of  9  October  2009,  in  respect  of  her
    previous anti-retroviral therapy, he considered that  if  she  were  no
    longer able to obtain her medication her CD4 count and  general  health
    would rapidly decline  and  she  would  become  susceptible  to  severe
    infection and cancers.  EC is treated with Atripla.   The  most  recent
    CD4 count was 597.  Her future health is dependent on continuing to  be
    able to receive an uninterrupted supply of  anti-retrovirals.   If  she
    were to receive an erratic supply, she would be at risk  of  developing
    resistant strains which would necessitate a change of  treatment  to  a
    more complex, more expensive and hence less available combination.   If
    she were unable to receive a supply that fully  controlled  her  virus,
    her life expectancy would be limited to less than three years, the risk
    being exacerbated by inadequate nutrition, particularly with respect to
    tuberculosis.

204.  As regards  availability  of  medication  for  HIV/AIDS  in  Zimbabwe,
    Professor Barnett's evidence was that medical treatment in  the  public
    sector was extremely unpredictable, poorly resourced and the facilities
    would not be appropriate for RS, in  respect  of  whom  he  provided  a
    report, to be  able  to  access  her  medication  or  the  clinical  or
    laboratory support she requires.  His recent researches  at  pharmacies
    had revealed that her drug regimen could be purchased for approximately
    US$100 per month.  He thought it very unlikely indeed that supplies  of
    her medication would be securely available in her  home  town  of  Dema
    through the private sector,  let  alone  via  the  public  sector.   He
    considered that in the public sector, were the  medications  available,
    the medical staff would in all probability be unavailable to  prescribe
    them and carry out the necessary medical checks as they  have  been  on
    strike frequently since  2009.   He  considered  that  with  regard  to
    availability of her medications, they would not  be  available  through
    the state system as the government had no money to pay to  import  them
    and they were not manufactured locally.

205.  Dr Mujuru-Mvere in her report prepared in  BR's  case  emphasised  the
    issue of scarcity of essential goods and services including life saving
    drugs such as ARVs to the extent that they are not affordable  for  the
    bulk of the population.  In her visit in late 2009 she  made  enquiries
    from a pharmacy in Harare which revealed that ARVs were  to  an  extent
    available in the private sector but supplies were inadequate and  their
    cost was high.  With regard to the situation in the public sector,  she
    used the example of the situation of the drug store she  visited  which
    had run out of Efavirenz, making arrangements to go to  the  University
    of Zimbabwe outlet to borrow supplies for  their  patients.   She  said
    that this was a significant improvement  on  what  she  had  previously
    observed, as in the past patients  on  the  government  scheme  had  to
    augment their combination ARV  treatment  shortfalls  themselves.   She
    concluded that there was no hope that BR would get the help  she  needs
    on return.  Of the ARVs currently prescribed to BR,  Dr  Mujuru-Mvere's
    research  revealed  that  Raltegravir  is  not  available  from  either
    government institutions or private pharmacies, Atazanavir and Ritonavir
    are likewise not available  from  government  institutions  or  private
    pharmacies and Truvada is not available in government hospitals.  To an
    extent, however, this contrasts with what was said by the World  Health
    Organisation responding to  Mr  Jones'  questionnaire  indicating  that
    Ritonavir can be purchased privately at a cost of USD$55 per  month  as
    of August 2009.  But we accept the situation is  one  which  is  fairly
    fluid and we attach no significance to that apparent distinction.

206.  It is relevant however to note the table set out by Mr Jones,  in  his
    report of 11  February  2010.   He  referred  to  the  reports  on  the
    availability of ART drugs from those interviewed and that the  Ministry
    of Health and Child Welfare had reported that the  drugs  available  in
    the public system were as set out in Annex J to his report.  He set out
    in his report a comprehensive list of those drugs  and  also  indicated
    which of them were stated to be available  by  the  Avenues  Clinic  in
    Harare during a visit on 11 February 2010.   They  include  Atazanavir,
    Truvada and Ritonavir, all of which are said to  be  available  in  the
    public system according to the Ministry of Health  and  Child  Welfare,
    though none of them is recorded as having been stated as  available  by
    the Avenues Clinic.   There  is  no  mention  of  the  availability  of
    Raltegravir as regards the drugs from which RS benefits.  According  to
    this list Tenofovir is available, and also  Zidovudine  and  Efavirenz,
    the latter two both available in the  Avenues  Clinic  on  11  February
    2010.  There is no mention  in  this  list  of  Atripla  which  is  the
    medication currently being taken by EC.

207.  There is therefore something of a conflict in the evidence as  to  the
    availability of various ART drugs, both as within the public sector and
    the private sector.  We do not think that it is being argued on the one
    hand that all ARTs are available in Zimbabwe or that none of them  are.
    It is apparently the case that Raltegravir is not available in Zimbabwe
    or indeed in Africa, and clearly that poses particular problems for BR.

208.  As regards the question of who provides ARVs, the WHO response  to  Mr
    Jones' questionnaire was that  ARVs  are  provided  from  a  number  of
    sources, including  the  government  of  Zimbabwe,  the  US  government
    through USAID, the Global Fund, NGOs and UN agencies.  The Zimbabwe Red
    Cross Society said that the government of Zimbabwe provides the greater
    percentage of the drugs through centres across the  country  and  these
    efforts are complemented by NGOs in  collaboration  with  the  Zimbabwe
    Ministry of Health.  The Zimbabwe  Association  of  Doctors  for  Human
    Rights said that only a small fraction of those needing  treatment  use
    private facilities and out of a total of 180,000 receiving treatment in
    Zimbabwe, around 140,000 are being treated  under  the  public  system.
    They say that 40,000 are under other treatment from NGOs, international
    organisations and private treatment.

209.  According to data  provided  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Child
    Welfare, by the end of November 2009 a total  of  215,123  people  were
    receiving ART in the public and private sectors.  It was said that this
    figure had gradually increased since 2004.  Physicians for Human Rights
    in their report of January 2009 reported that some 205,000 people  were
    thought to be taking anti-retrovirals.  Dr Kibble echoes that figure of
    about 200,000, though he refers  to  an  estimated  400,000  who  would
    plausibly benefit from such treatment,  whereas  Physicians  for  Human
    Rights considered that some 800,000 Zimbabweans were thought to require
    therapy or would require it in the coming months/years.   The  Ministry
    of Health and Child Welfare figures  therefore  appear  to  be  broadly
    credible.  As regards where treatment takes  place,  Mr  Jones'  report
    says that estimates for waiting times vary in part due to the fact that
    there are so many organisations involved in the process.  For  example,
    M�decins Sans Fronti�res provide treatment exclusively  in  the  Buhera
    district, and also have HIV programmes in other locations in Manicaland
    Province supporting free healthcare for 40,000 people.  There are  said
    to be numerous clinics  and  treatment  centres  run  independently  by
    various  organisations.   The  WHO  in  its  response  to   Mr   Jones'
    questionnaire said that of the estimated 300 clinics in  Zimbabwe,  100
    are involved in  initialising  treatment,  with  200  concentrating  on
    follow up treatment.  It also said that waiting  times  for  those  not
    deemed to be priority cases could typically be up to six months.

210.  From the evidence as a whole we conclude that there are a  significant
    number of people receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe,  and  we
    do not consider  that  waiting  times,  as  set  out  in  the  previous
    paragraph, are excessive.  It is relevant in this regard also  to  note
    the document in the respondent's bundle entitled "Guidelines for  anti-
    retroviral therapy in Zimbabwe" dated September 2009  and  provided  by
    the National Drug and Therapeutics Policy Advisory  Committee  (NDTPAC)
    and AIDS and TB Unit of the Ministry of Health  and  Child  Welfare  in
    Zimbabwe which sets out detailed guidelines to assist those involved in
    the management of HIV and AIDS in Zimbabwe.

211.  We turn next to the question of whether there  is  discrimination  and
    politicisation of access to AIDS treatment  and  therapy  in  Zimbabwe.
    Professor  Barnett  referred  to  a  variety  of   mechanisms   whereby
    government policy results in supplies of ARVs being directed favourably
    to those who are likely to be ZANU-PF members.  He referred to  reports
    of ZANU-PF diverting medications and to a report speaking  of  "theft",
    but  we  do  not  see   that   as   necessarily   entailing   political
    discrimination but rather opportunism.  He also referred to reports  of
    people being required to present membership  cards  at  public  medical
    facilities, though it is not clear what his source for this remark  is.
    He said that in rural areas  AIDS  committees  have  the  potential  to
    facilitate or block an individual's  access  to  medication.   He  also
    referred to the diversion by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe of the  USD$7
    million from the Global Fund's Round 5 grant earmarked for  scaling  up
    the national anti-retroviral programme which, after public protest, was
    returned to the Global Fund.  He appeared to be critical of the WHO for
    working on the basis of reports from the field, but that seems to us to
    be entirely proper and, indeed, almost  inevitable.   He  thought  that
    local committee members who were ZANU-PF supporters would  be  unlikely
    to certify or support someone whom he or she knew to be a supporter  of
    the MDC, but that would not be the case for any  of  these  appellants.
    Contrary to what was said by Dr Baggaley, he did not say  that  only  a
    card-carrying ZANU-PF member would be likely to obtain  a  letter  from
    social welfare  recommending  free  treatment.   Dr  Baggaley  said  in
    February 2007 that if available people receiving  ART  had  to  have  a
    letter from social welfare recommending free treatment and according to
    colleagues in Harare it was unlikely  that  anyone  would  be  able  to
    obtain this letter of support unless they were a card  carrying  member
    of ZANU-PF.  If they had other political  affiliations  or  were  known
    previously to have been members of the opposition  party  it  would  be
    highly  unlikely  that  they  would  be  supplied  with  the  necessary
    paperwork needed for them to get free ART.  She also  quoted  a  (then)
    recent report from Human  Rights  Watch  that  access  to  ART  through
    government schemes is "subjective and arbitrary".  It  is  relevant  to
    note in passing that this evidence is some three years old and also  is
    made available from one source only.

212.  Dr Mujuru-Mvere considers that the local aid structures either aid  or
    hinder someone's progress leading to a real risk  of  deterioration  in
    health and  subsequent  death.   She  said  that  it  has  always  been
    government policy that for someone to access free government  treatment
    or other free handouts from government there has to be means testing at
    local level and a letter of support written.  She says that to get this
    letter  of  support  can  be  very  subjective  and  discriminatory  on
    political lines, increasing the  vulnerability  of  HIV  sufferers  now
    compounded with the high levels of corruption.  There is  some  support
    for what she says in this regard from Professor Barnett.  There is also
    the evidence to which we have referred above from  the  Zimbabwe  Peace
    Project of 1 December 2009  concerning  the  registration  process  for
    HIV/AIDS and TB patients who want  to  be  registered  for  NGO  relief
    assistance, who have to go through  village  health  workers,  claiming
    that these well laid out  procedures  have  been  politicised  in  that
    intending  beneficiaries  have  to  register  first  with  the  ZANU-PF
    District Chairpersons who  would  then  authorise  the  village  health
    workers to register the patient for relief assistance.

213.  One sees little if any of  this  reflected  in  the  responses  to  Mr
    Jones'  questionnaire.   For  example,  the   WHO   denied   that   the
    availability of ARVs was in any way dictated by  political  affiliation
    and nor would someone have to demonstrate loyalty to a political  party
    to obtain ARVs.  They simply say that priority for treatment  is  given
    to children, health  workers  and  their  immediate  families  and  all
    patients who meet the criteria set  in  the  National  ART  Guidelines.
    Perhaps not surprisingly, the National ART Guidelines do  not  indicate
    any political or other bias in access to treatment.  The  Zimbabwe  Red
    Cross refer to a defined referral system which does not discriminate on
    grounds of  race,  gender,  political  affiliation  or  religion.   The
    Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights states that there  has
    been some limited anecdotal evidence to suggest that  the  availability
    of ARVs is dictated by political affiliation and loyalty for  political
    party might have to be demonstrated, but says  it  is  insufficient  to
    support this view and says that there  is  no  suggestion  that  it  is
    systematic or policy driven.  These conclusions are also borne  out  by
    the anonymous respondees at Annex C and Annex D of Mr Jones' report.

214.  The evidence overall therefore presents something of a  mixed  picture
    on this important point.  We bear in mind that the legal test  is  that
    of  showing  a  reasonable  degree  of  likelihood.   On  the  evidence
    considered as a whole, we are not satisfied that it has been shown that
    there is a reasonable degree of likelihood that any of these appellants
    would be confronted with the need to display political  affiliation  or
    political loyalty in order to obtain ARVs.   It  is  clearly  something
    that happens, but not generally, and we consider  that  ultimately  the
    comment that the evidence is anecdotal is one that is borne out  by  an
    overall assessment of the evidence as a whole.  There is a  risk  that,
    perhaps particularly in rural areas, difficulty  might  be  confronted,
    but we do not consider that that amounts to a real risk and accordingly
    our assessment of the evidence is that  it  has  not  been  shown  that
    access to ARVs  is  dictated  by  political  affiliation  or  that  the
    appellants  would  experience  any  real  problems  in   that   regard.
    Specifically, it has not  been  shown  that  any  of  them  would  face
    discriminatory access in their home areas, to which they would return.

215.  We consider next the issue of access to food  and  any  politicisation
    in that  regard.   Again  we  consider  the  evidence  of  this  to  be
    essentially anecdotal.  It is clear that food has been and  remains  in
    short supply in Zimbabwe.  Professor Barnett quotes from the  Guardian,
    itself quoting the International Red  Cross/Red  Crescent/Zimbabwe  Red
    Cross as stating that life for large sectors of the population who have
    no access to cash remains very difficult in rural and urban areas.   It
    is reported that 56% of Zimbabweans live below USD$1 per  day  and  80%
    live below USD$2 per day.  Though availability of food  has  increased,
    access  remains  a  limiting  factor.   Problems  were   magnified   in
    vulnerable households including those badly impacted by HIV  and  AIDS.
    This report is dated 2 December 2009.  Professor Barnett says that  "at
    times" food supplies have been restricted by administrative  action  to
    those who can show that they are supporters of ZANU-PF and  that  those
    who could not prove this to be the  case  were  sometimes  deprived  of
    food.  He does not however state this as being the  current  situation.
    Professor Barnett also makes it clear  that  major  NGOs  such  as  the
    International  Red  Cross  and  the  Red  Cross  are  able  to  operate
    relatively freely and effectively within Zimbabwe and also some  people
    are in receipt of food aid in the form  of  food  vouchers  from  those
    organisations, notably in urban areas.  He did not disagree when it was
    put to him that in a MDC seat such as Chitungwiza, to  which  BR  would
    return, there would be people willing to  identify  MDC  supporters  in
    order to obtain authorisation documents for  food  aid.   He  made  the
    point that one could not be sure that the town hall or village  council
    had not altered its political  complexion,  though  this,  we  suppose,
    could equally be said of an area previously thought  to  be  a  ZANU-PF
    stronghold.  He agreed that there was less  bias  in  respect  of  food
    distribution in urban areas, and it was reasonable to conclude that EC,
    on return to Harare, would be unlikely to  face  any  substantial  bias
    regarding food aid if vouchers were to be relied on.

216.  In her report, Dr Mujuru-Mvere refers  to  the  need  for  bribery  in
    order to acquire many commodities or services.  There would be problems
    in queuing and problems of ability to buy food because most supplies of
    commodities have substantially increased  and  are  being  sold  in  US
    dollars or South African rand.  During her 2008 visit she had  observed
    people queuing all the time for scarce provisions and though there  was
    less queuing when she arrived in November 2009 that was because of  the
    availability of goods albeit  sold  in  foreign  currencies,  but  just
    before she left queuing resurfaced just  as  in  2008,  indicating  the
    fragility of some of the apparent improvements.  Dr  Kibble  refers  to
    the politicisation of food and that this continues to favour government
    supporters and those who have obtained a ZANU-PF membership  card.   He
    says that those without are left to starve especially when the  ban  on
    humanitarian agencies was only  lifted  in  September  2008,  but  with
    severe restrictions on what NGOs can do.  He confirms what  Dr  Mujuru-
    Mvere says about the impact on the availability of  commodities  except
    for those with dollars, leaving only the black market as  a  source  of
    goods and food and says that it is difficult for anyone unemployed  and
    without a support network or remittances from the diaspora to survive.

217.  It has to be borne in mind in this regard  however  that  the  ban  on
    humanitarian  agencies  was  lifted  in  September  2008,  albeit  with
    restrictions on what they can  do.   Nevertheless  we  see  that  as  a
    positive sign.  It is relevant also however  to  mention  the  evidence
    from the  Zimbabwe  Peace  Project  that  public  access  to  food  and
    humanitarian assistance is being denied through well  coordinated  webs
    of partisan structures such as ward coordinators,  volunteers,  village
    heads, councillors and chairpersons.  The Project said that it recorded
    133 violations relating to food  and  humanitarian  assistance  in  the
    month of August (it seems likely that  this  is  2009)  with  cases  of
    discrimination constituting 87% of the incidents.  It is  alleged  that
    in certain provinces supporters of the MDC had their names removed from
    food registers or donors were misinformed that targeted people were  no
    longer in need of food relief.  It is also  said  that  in  Mashonaland
    East, a ZANU-PF stronghold, beneficiaries are required to produce party
    membership cards and to attend political meetings regularly.  There  is
    an uncorroborated report at page 9 of the country  material  bundle  of
    the appellants from Eyewitness News that the government had  taken  the
    radical move of banning all food handouts by NGOs.  This is said to  be
    dated 13 February 2010.  It was said to be done on the basis  that  the
    government was reintroducing food for  work  programmes  and  the  main
    motivation was to ensure the  rehabilitation  of  farmland.   Professor
    Barnett made no reference to this.  Mr Jones said that the Embassy  had
    received no reports that food aid had been banned,  and  there  was  no
    information from NGOs to confirm that this had happened.  In the  USAID
    Zimbabwe Food Security Outlook to June 2010 report in  the  appellants'
    country bundle, there is reference to a significant improvement in  the
    availability of staple cereals at  the  sub-national  level  and  to  a
    relatively stable current food security situation at page  36.   It  is
    thought that the importance of livestock and remittances,  particularly
    in the southern half and eastern parts of the country  is  expected  to
    ameliorate the projected food  insecurity  levels  to  moderately  food
    insecure between April and July 2010.  It is also thought  likely  that
    food aid programmes will kick in earlier than  usual  in  those  areas,
    further reducing the food insecurity severity.

218.  The Country of Origin  Information  Report  of  22  December  2009  on
    Zimbabwe has a section on the politicisation of food.  It is noted that
    reports of political bias in the distribution of food continued through
    2008 and into 2009, with reference to food distributions being  run  by
    the  army,  the  Central  Intelligence  Organisation,  the  police  and
    district  administrators.   There  were  reports  from  2005  and  2007
    concerning the political manipulation of food aid and a report  by  the
    International Crisis Group on 20 April 2009 that ZANU-PF  was  believed
    still to divert food and distribute it on  a  partisan  rather  than  a
    strict need basis.  There is further reference in the Solidarity  Peace
    Trust Report to all districts within  Matabeleland  reporting  problems
    with political manipulation of access to maize, saying that only  ZANU-
    PF card holders were able to buy maize from the Grain  Marketing  Board
    (GMB) and another report of October 2009  concerning  high  numbers  of
    villagers being denied food by ZANU-PF if they do not renounce the MDC.
     There is reference to a Zimbabwe Peace Project Report  on  1  December
    2009 reporting that ZANU-PF continue to use food  aid  as  a  political
    weapon, denying  known  opponents  assistance  from  government  relief
    agencies.  It is of course the case that  there  was  evidence  of  the
    politicisation of access to food and medicines before the  Tribunal  in
    RN, for example at paragraph 104 where it was noted that  the  evidence
    indicated that the government continued to deny food and  medicines  to
    perceived supporters  of  the  MDC,  and  evidence  that  the  European
    Commission discussed at paragraph 203 that returnees would be likely to
    find it harder than others to get access to food and services.

219.  It is relevant however to note that there are no  confirmed  cases  of
    politicisation of international food aid through NGOs who, as is argued
    in the  Secretary  of  State's  written  submissions,  operate  a  zero
    tolerance role respecting  bias  in  the  selection  of  those  needing
    assistance, and who also make the final selection of recipients.  It is
    also not without significance that the Minister of Health (and also the
    Minister of Finance) in the National Government  of  Unity  is  an  MDC
    member, and Mr Tsvangirai chairs the Council of  Ministers  responsible
    for implementation of government policies.

220.  Bringing all this evidence together, we do not consider  it  has  been
    shown that there is a real risk that any of  the  appellants  would  be
    denied food aid on grounds of political opinion.   Certainly  there  is
    evidence of discriminatory denial of access to food, but we see that as
    being no more than sporadic and  certainly  not  endemic.   Nor  do  we
    consider that there is a real risk of harm to any of the appellants  on
    the cumulative basis of access to medication and access to food.

Refugee Convention

221.  There is little that  we  need  to  add  in  respect  of  the  Refugee
    Convention given what we have said about Article 3.  As  we  have  said
    elsewhere, we consider the country  guidance  in  RN  continues  to  be
    binding and to set out the appropriate criteria  for  the  analysis  of
    risk on return under the Refugee Convention as would  be  the  case  in
    respect of these  three  appellants  of  actual  or  imputed  political
    opinion.  Given the conclusions that we  have  come  to  about  claimed
    politicisation of access to AIDS medication, associated medication  and
    access to food, we do not consider that any difficulties the appellants
    may experience in accessing medication and/or food can be said to arise
    as a consequence of there being a real risk of this being motivated  by
    considerations of  imputed  political  belief.   Insofar  as  there  is
    evidence of differential access, we consider that it  is,  as  we  have
    explained above, random  and  not  systemic.   Accordingly  we  do  not
    consider that any of  these  appeals  can  succeed  under  the  Refugee
    Convention.

Article 8

222.  It is clear that in a case such as  this  involving  physical  health,
    the private life aspect of Article 8 may be engaged.  As  much  can  be
    seen from Bensaid  v  United  Kingdom  [2001]  33  EHRR  10  where,  at
    paragraph 47, the Court of Human  Rights  made  it  clear  that  mental
    health had to be regarded as a crucial part of private life  associated
    with the aspect of moral integrity, and clearly  it  must  follow  from
    that that physical health must be regarded likewise.

223.  A particular submission in respect of Article 8 is made  in  the  case
    of EC.  This is, as summarised in  the  skeleton  argument  for  EC  at
    paragraph 55, that the Secretary of State has been operating a  policy,
    which has been varied from time to time,  on  the  proper  approach  to
    applications for leave to remain by persons  with  HIV/AIDS;  that  any
    interference with an individual's Article 8 rights requires  to  be  in
    accordance with the law, which includes  a  requirement  to  adhere  to
    relevant policies;  such  law  and  policy  require  to  be  clear  and
    accessible; however, the  Secretary  of  State  withdrew  his  HIV/AIDS
    policy in February 2007 "for updating" but has failed  to  publish  any
    such updated policy since then;  and  it  follows  therefore  that  the
    Secretary of State does not have a clear or accessible  policy  on  the
    point and/or has failed to apply that policy to  the  individual  case,
    and therefore the interference with EC's Article 8  rights  is  not  in
    accordance with the law.  These points are elaborated on at  paragraphs
    56 to 94 of the skeleton.

224.  The present version of the Secretary of State's policy on people  with
    HIV/AIDS is contained in  Chapter  1,  section  8  of  the  Immigration
    Directorate Instructions (IDIs) which we shall refer to as "the medical
    IDIs".  There appear to have been earlier versions in  1998  and  2000,
    but the particular version we have concentrated on in  connection  with
    EC's argument in this regard is  the  March  2004  version  ("the  2004
    policy").  This contains full  guidance  on  the  matter  and  includes
    references to D v United Kingdom and N in  the  Court  of  Appeal,  and
    states in summary that such cases will have to be ones that  are  truly
    exceptional and involve extreme circumstances.  Examples  of  this  are
    given.

225.  This was replaced by the 2007 policy which states as follows:

        "3.4     Human Rights Act


           This paragraph has been withdrawn  for  updating.   Claims  that
             removal from the United Kingdom would breach Articles 3  and/or
             8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights  because  of  the
             claimant's medical condition should be considered in accordance
             with the House of Lords judgment in the case of N v SSHD [2005]
             UKHL 31 and other relevant case law."

226.  It is argued in EC's skeleton that, bearing in mind the terms  of  the
    earlier policies which were referred to and discussed by Baroness  Hale
    in N v SSHD, in the 2004 policy the Secretary of  State  envisaged  the
    prospect of a grant of leave to remain on medical/human rights  grounds
    in circumstances which, though narrow, were wider than those  envisaged
    in D or in N.  The policy remained in place,  unaltered,  however,  for
    almost two years after N was decided.  For example, D is referred to in
    the 2004 policy as "an  example"  rather  than  constituting  the  only
    circumstances in which Article 3 might be breached.   We  interpose  at
    this point that that must be right.  The European Court of Human Rights
    did not limit the application of Article 3 or Article 8 to the specific
    circumstances in D and clearly other examples of extreme  circumstances
    may exist.  A further part of the 2004 policy, whether "the removal  of
    the patient would both significantly shorten his or her life expectancy
    and result in acute mental or physical suffering" is, it is  argued  in
    the skeleton, significantly more generous than the test in  N  v  SSHD,
    and a further criterion, whether:

        "the  claimant  has  been  receiving  treatment  for  the  relevant
        condition in the UK for a long time (i.e. more than five years) and
        has become dependent on the treatment he or  she  is  receiving  to
        sustain life even for a short period"

      does not appear to play any part in the judgments in N.

227.  It is argued at paragraph 68 of the skeleton  argument  in  EC's  case
    that it is not clear whether the 2004 policy remains the  Secretary  of
    State's policy, since the Secretary of State has "withdrawn" that  part
    of the IDI and has not published the  updated  policy  for  some  three
    years, without giving any indication of when the updated  version  will
    be ready.  It is argued on behalf of EC that, as the European Court  of
    Human Rights has frequently reiterated, it is vital that the law should
    be accessible and clear.  Reference is made to the Court's  elaboration
    of this principle in Sunday Times v UK [1979] 2 EHRR 245  at  paragraph
    49, and Malone v UK [1984] 7 EHRR 14.  It is further argued that if the
    Secretary of State does not currently have a policy on the point, it is
    very difficult  to  see  how  she  might  have  any  lawful  basis  for
    interfering with EC's Convention rights in the absence of any clear  or
    adequate guidance to her officials on when it might  or  might  not  be
    appropriate to remove people in her position.  The fact that it is said
    that the policy is being updated indicates that something  else  is  in
    mind other than refusal in cases not analogous to N and D.  It is  said
    therefore that there is no published policy  on  whether  and  in  what
    circumstances the Secretary of State will allow people with HIV/AIDS to
    remain in the United Kingdom, beyond the  obvious  statement  that  she
    will not act contrary to the judgments of the courts.  The  requirement
    to have a clear and accessible policy is said to be all the greater  in
    the light of the Secretary of State's duties  under  the  DDA.   It  is
    argued that merely  instructing  her  caseworkers  to  have  regard  to
    "relevant case law" does not constitute a policy but a statement of the
    obvious.  It is also said that the policy is out  of  date  because  it
    fails to refer to the decision in N v United Kingdom and it  cannot  be
    said that the answer lies simply in the case  law.   The  Secretary  of
    State has discretion  to  act  more  generously  than  her  obligations
    require, and her policies in the past have reflected that fact.  It  is
    said therefore that until the updated policy is published, it cannot be
    known whether it is more generous than Article 3 requires and,  if  so,
    whether it would be a breach of Article 8 not to apply it and that,  in
    any event, it is a breach of Article 8 not to ensure it is sufficiently
    publicised and accessible and  therefore  the  interference  with  EC's
    Article 8(1) rights cannot be in accordance with the law.

228.  The  Secretary of State's submission in  response  is  that  the  2007
    guidance, which mandates the application of  the  consistent  ECHR  and
    domestic jurisprudence on Article 3  and  medical  treatment,  is  both
    sufficiently certain to  qualify  for  the  description  of  being  "in
    accordance with the law" and publicly accessible.  It is argued that  a
    statement by the Secretary of State that she  will  act  in  accordance
    with the applicable legal principles is sufficient and clearly  enables
    individuals to  regulate  their  conduct  and  provides  no  reasonable
    suggestion that they  be  allowed  to  stay  outside  an  "exceptional"
    situation which meets the D v United Kingdom criteria.  It  is  argued,
    with respect to  paragraph  76  of  EC's  skeleton,  that  the  complex
    regulatory situation regarding telephone tapping, as in Malone,  is  in
    no  way  comparable  to  the  exercise  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    discretion to allow a "more generous" claim  than  would  be  permitted
    under Article 3.   Unlike  the  examples  of  R  (Salih  &  Rahmani)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003]  EWHC  2273  (Admin),
    and Abdi and Ors v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2008]
    EWHC 3166 (Admin), referred to at paragraph 77 of EC's skeleton, it  is
    not a case involving a "secret" unpublished policy and  needing  to  be
    distinguished from such cases.  It is argued that there is no case  law
    to establish the proposition that the Secretary of State  must  have  a
    policy setting out in detail how she proposes to exercise every  aspect
    of a discretion which she possesses.

229.  We agree with the submissions made  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State in this regard.  There is no obligation on the Secretary of State
    to have a policy indicating how she will exercise  every  part  of  the
    discretions she has at any given time.  In any event, there is a policy
    which is the 2007 guidance.   There  is  nothing  inconsistent  in  the
    Secretary of State having a policy that effectively coincides with  the
    existing law.  The decision of the House of Lords  in  N  was,  broadly
    speaking, endorsed by the European Court of  Human  Rights.   The  fact
    that the earlier policy may have been broader in some respects than the
    relevant legal principles as set out by the courts at that time, in  no
    sense entails that a subsequent policy is  required  to  maintain  that
    breadth.  No doubt the "other relevant  case  law"  to  be  taken  into
    account by caseworkers under the 2007 guidance must be taken to include
    what was said by the European Court of Human Rights in N subsequent  to
    the decision of the House of Lords.  We do not consider it can be  said
    that pointing caseworkers and others to the decision of  the  House  of
    Lords and other relevant case law breaches the requirements of  clarity
    or accessibility.  It must, we think, be clear to  anybody  looking  at
    this guidance that there is no discretion propounded by  the  Secretary
    of State for the assessment of cases such as EC's outside the  existing
    legal principles.  That is a policy which it is perfectly open  to  the
    Secretary of State to have, and we do not consider that the nature  and
    status of that policy are such  as  to  indicate  that  it  is  not  in
    accordance with the law.

230.  With regard to the reference at paragraphs 90 to 92 of  EC's  skeleton
    to the IDIs dealing with leave outside the Rules, which say that  leave
    may  be  granted  outside   the   Rules   in   "particular   compelling
    circumstances" but

        "only for genuinely compassionate  and  circumstantial  reasons  or
        where it  is  deemed  absolutely  necessary  to  allow  someone  to
        enter/remain  in  the  United  Kingdom,  when  there  is  no  other
        available option."

      Again this does not appear to us to be either lacking  in  clarity  or
    couched in such terms that it is at all likely  that  if  it  had  been
    considered and applied in this case it would have been decided  in  the
    appellant's favour.  It is clear that compassionate circumstances  were
    taken into account in the case of EC in the Secretary of State's letter
    of 25 June 2003, albeit not specifically from the  perspective  of  the
    IDI on leave outside the Rules, but we do not think that  any  specific
    consideration of the case in that context could have led to a  positive
    outcome for the appellant, in particular given the light of the  latter
    part of the instruction which is  clearly  indicative  of  an  entirely
    exceptional case having to be shown.

231.  Otherwise, as regards Article 8, the position of all three  appellants
    contrasts with the situation in JA (Ivory Coast), where the  appellants
    had  been  granted  leave  to  remain  specifically  to  continue  with
    treatment for HIV in accordance with a Home Office policy.  It was said
    that it would not be necessary for such a person  to  show  exceptional
    circumstances as compelling as those required by D  v  United  Kingdom.
    However, none of the appellants in the instant appeals has been granted
    leave on this basis, and they must therefore, in  our  view,  meet  the
    exceptionality test set out in D.  In Razgar  [2004]  2  AC  368,  Lord
    Bingham said (at 380):

         "...I have no doubt that the court would adopt the same approach to
         an application based on Article 8.  It would indeed  frustrate  the
         proper and necessary object of  immigration  control  in  the  more
         advanced member states of the Council of Europe if illegal entrants
         requiring medical treatment could not, save in  exceptional  cases,
         be removed to the less  developed  countries  of  the  world  where
         comparable medical facilities were not available."


    We conclude therefore that the appellants do not succeed under  Article
    8 in respect of their health problems.

Article 14

232.  Article 14 of the European Human Rights Convention states as follows:

         "Prohibition of Discrimination


         The enjoyment  of  the  rights  and  freedoms  set  forth  in  this
         Convention shall be secured without discrimination  on  any  ground
         such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political  or  other
         opinion, national or social origin,  association  with  a  national
         minority, property, birth or other status."

      As we understand the appellants' arguments, it is contended  that  the
    discrimination which it is said that the appellants would experience on
    removal to Zimbabwe on account of  their  health  problems  amounts  to
    discrimination on the basis of their "other status", or  possibly  also
    on grounds of political opinion.

233.  In Wandsworth LBC v Michalak [2003] 1 WLR 617,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    set out the governing principles  relevant  to  the  resolution  of  an
    Article 14 issue, developed initially by the Court of Human  Rights  in
    the Belgian Linguistic Case (Number 2) [1968] 1 EHRR 252.  These are as
    follows:

    (i)    Do the facts fall within  the  ambit  of  one  or  more  of  the
         substantive Convention provisions?


    (ii)   If so, was there a different treatment as  respects  that  right
         between the complainant on the one hand and the chosen  comparators
         on the other?


    (iii)  Were the chosen comparators in an  analogous  situation  to  the
         complainant's situation?


    (iv)   If so, did the difference in treatment  have  an  objective  and
         reasonable justification?

234.  In the skeleton argument the appellants  add  a  further  requirement,
    "Was that difference in treatment based on one or more of  the  grounds
    proscribed by Article  14?"  (which  follows  from  what  was  said  at
    paragraph 40 of the decision of the Court of Human Rights in Thlimmenos
    v Greece [2001] 31 EHRR 14).  It is clear, as is  pointed  out  in  the
    appellants' skeleton argument, citing Thlimmenos, that the right not to
    be discriminated against in the enjoyment of  rights  guaranteed  under
    the Convention is violated when states without an objective  reasonable
    justification fail to treat differently persons  whose  situations  are
    significantly  different.   That  case  also  makes   it   clear   that
    discrimination occurs where there has been a  difference  in  treatment
    but also where persons are treated in the same way but in circumstances
    where that treatment is especially disadvantageous to one group.  It is
    argued as a consequence that this imposes a duty to make adjustments or
    treat more favourably such disadvantaged groups so  as  to  obviate  or
    mitigate that disadvantage.

235.  On behalf of the respondent it  is  argued  that  the  appellants  are
    apparently unable to point to any case law in which  a  claim  of  this
    nature has been put forward or accepted and  that  also  the  arguments
    fail to address  the  issue  of  the  relevant  "comparators".   It  is
    suggested that  if  the  argument  is  that  as  "disabled  people"  or
    alternatively as women the appellants should be  treated  "differently"
    from those others removed or deported from the United  Kingdom  on  the
    basis they will suffer worse consequences than  those  others,  and  so
    "adjustment" is needed, then this is an impermissibly broad comparison.



236.  Firstly, as to the issue of the "ambit", it is common ground that  the
    claims clearly fall within the ambit of Article 8 and  Article  3,  and
    accordingly Article 14 is appropriate for consideration.

237.  It can be seen from the  decision  of  the  European  Court  of  Human
    Rights in Thlimmenos v Greece [2001] 31 EHRR  14,  that  discrimination
    may arise  because  analogous  groups  are  treated  differently  where
    people, including disabled and non-disabled people, are treated in  the
    same way but  in  circumstances  where  that  treatment  is  especially
    disadvantageous to one group.  Like the Secretary  of  State,  we  have
    some difficulty in understanding who the proper "comparators" are.  The
    suggestion is that it may be that either  as  disabled  people  or  HIV
    sufferers or as women, the appellants  should  be  treated  differently
    from others who are removed or deported from the United Kingdom on  the
    basis of the consequences they will face on return and  that  therefore
    some form of  adjustment  is  required.   As  is  pointed  out  by  the
    Secretary of State, however, the categories of those subject to removal
    are many and varied, and the range of consequences  they  may  face  on
    return may also vary considerably.  It may be  that  in  the  end  this
    comes down to an argument about justification, to which  we  will  come
    shortly, but we agree that it does seem unmanageably  broad  to  single
    out the factor of access to medical treatment, for example,  and  claim
    that this creates a group which should be compared to all people who do
    not face medical issues or gender disadvantage and does not permit  the
    making of sensible comparisons.  We are  not  aware  of  any  authority
    which suggests that unlawful discrimination under Article 14 occurs  in
    circumstances where removal may be especially  disadvantageous  to  one
    particular group.

238.  The third issue is whether the difference in treatment  was  based  on
    one or more of the grounds proscribed by Article 14.  Again  there  is,
    we think, no  issue  as  to  this,  as  discrimination  on  grounds  of
    political opinion is explicitly prohibited and, as pointed out  in  the
    appellants' skeleton,  disability  is  covered  by  "other  status"  in
    Article  14.   The  final  and  perhaps  crucial  point  is   that   of
    justification.  Here, as is emphasised in the Belgian  Linguistic  Case
    (Number 2) [1968] 1 EHRR 252, there will be a violation of  Article  14
    if  there  is  no  reasonable  and  objective  justification  for   the
    discrimination.  In that case it was said that "the existence  of  such
    justification must be assessed in relation to the "aims and effects  of
    the measure under consideration, regard being  had  to  the  principles
    which normally  prevail  in  democratic  societies".   In  DH  v  Czech
    Republic [2008] 47 EHRR 3 it was said that the notion of objective  and
    reasonable justification must be interpreted as  strictly  as  possible
    where the discrimination is connected to a "suspect class", and  it  is
    argued on behalf of the appellants that disability should  be  regarded
    as a "suspect class".  Thereafter it is argued  that  unless  there  is
    shown to be a violation of Article 3 or Article  8,  the  Secretary  of
    State will remove an individual in  respect  of  a  disability  in  all
    cases, and it is contended that such a rule is impossible  to  justify,
    especially when, as it is contended, it is in breach of the DDA.  It is
    argued that as a consequence the Secretary of  State  cannot  discharge
    the burden of establishing justification in this case.

239.  We see considerable force however  in  the  argument  put  forward  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State, that clearly nothing is added in this
    case by  a  claim  under  Article  14.   If,  as  we  have  found,  the
    interference is permissible or  justified  under  Article  8,  then  it
    cannot be said that the state has, without any objective or  reasonable
    justification, failed to afford proper treatment to the  appellants  by
    failing to give proper recognition to any aspect of  the  disadvantages
    which they may face on return.  As it is put in the alternative, if the
    removal is justified under Article 8 on full consideration of the  case
    then the fact that others removed  might  suffer  consequences  not  so
    adverse cannot render the decision to remove unlawful.  In addition, it
    seems to us that the issue  in  these  appeals  involves  a  matter  of
    general social policy,  rather  than  the  right  to  respect  for  the
    individuality of human beings, as identified by the House of Lords in R
    (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] UKHL 37,  at
    paragraphs 15-17 per Lord Hoffman,  and  decisions  about  the  general
    public  interest  which  underpin  differences  in  treatment  in  that
    category of case are very much a matter for the democratically  elected
    branches of government.  Accordingly we consider that the Secretary  of
    State can discharge and  has  discharged  the  burden  of  establishing
    justification in this case and we find  that  there  is  no  breach  of
    Article 14.

Disability Discrimination Act

240.  In the skeleton argument the appellants assert that the  Tribunal  has
    jurisdiction to deal with issues under the DDA, referring to a decision
    of the Tribunal in NM (Disability  discrimination)  Iraq  [2008]  UKAIT
    00026, where the Tribunal considered arguments based on the  Act.   The
    point is made that the  Tribunal  plainly  regarded  itself  as  having
    jurisdiction to deal  with  those  arguments,  albeit  that  they  were
    unsuccessful on the facts.

241.  At that  stage  the  appellants  said  no  more  about  the  issue  of
    jurisdiction, but in light of detailed points made  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State, which we set out below, there  was  subsequently  a
    detailed response on this matter on behalf  of  the  appellants,  which
    again of course we shall go into in some detail.

242.  As regards the point made at paragraph 68 of the skeleton to which  we
    have referred above, we say no more at this stage than that NM  was  in
    our view but slender authority for the Tribunal having jurisdiction  to
    deal with the issue since an assumption of jurisdiction  cannot  amount
    to a reality of jurisdiction.  As is  pointed  out  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State at paragraph 25 of the written  submissions  on  the
    DDA, it is clear that the issue of jurisdiction was not  argued  before
    the Tribunal in NM, and the Tribunal appears to have had some doubts as
    to its jurisdiction, albeit that it was considering it in  the  context
    of whether the Act had extraterritorial effect.

243.  Before going on to consider in detail the respective  submissions,  it
    is relevant to note that  the  Secretary  of  State's  submissions  are
    amended submissions following the considered position taken  subsequent
    to earlier submissions having been filed, that the Secretary  of  State
    did not wish to argue that the phrase "in accordance with the  law"  as
    set out in sections 84 and  86  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 is limited in the manner in which it was argued  to  be
    in the original submissions filed on 23 March 2010.   The  letter  from
    the Treasury Solicitor goes on to say that for policy and legal reasons
    the Secretary of State is  content  to  accept  that,  subject  to  the
    statutory limitations contained in the DDA itself, sections 84  and  86
    of the 2002 Act would be wide enough to  cover  an  argument  that  the
    decision was unlawful under the DDA.

244.  In her submissions, the  Secretary  of  State  makes  the  point  that
    section 25 of the Act,  which  is  headed  "Enforcement,  Remedies  and
    Procedure", makes it clear that any proceedings under Part III  of  the
    Act, which would include the first head of the appellant's  DDA  claim,
    can only be  brought  in  a  County  Court  (or  by  judicial  review).
    Reference is also made to Schedule 3 Part 2 of the Act at  paragraph  5
    and also the point is made that unlike the  Race  Relations  Act  1976,
    which at section 53 specifically includes the provisions of Part  5  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  in  respect  of  the
    proceedings which may lie against any person in respect of an act which
    is made unlawful by virtue of a provision of the  Race  Relations  Act,
    the DDA is silent on the point.  The point is also  made  that  section
    57A of the Race Relations Act makes  specific  exclusionary  provisions
    for "immigration cases",  and  therefore  in  effect  broadly  the  Act
    envisages that alleged acts of racial discrimination under section  19B
    are to be litigated in the County Court as breaches of  statutory  duty
    save that in relation  to  immigration  decisions,  there  is  specific
    provision to ensure that those issues are instead  tested  in  the  AIT
    where there are rights of appeal under the  2002  Act,  and  that  this
    clearly contrasts  with  the  provisions  in  the  DDA.   There  is  no
    provision made to allocate a role to the AIT.

245.  The point is further made at paragraph 14 of the  written  submissions
    that by virtue of the DDA's specific  enforcement  scheme  it  is  only
    where there is a claim under the Human Rights Act 1988  that  there  is
    jurisdiction  for  consideration  within  an  immigration   appeal   of
    disability  discrimination  arguments.   It  is  noted  that  the  Race
    Relations Act is specifically listed in section 84(1)(b)  of  the  2002
    Act, whereas the DDA  is  not  listed  and  by  reason  of  a  specific
    jurisdictional  scheme  it  is  said  that  it  falls  outwith  section
    84(1)(e).

246.  As regards the second head of the appellants' DDA claim, which  arises
    under sections 49A and 49D of the DDA, it is argued  that  there  is  a
    breach of the Secretary of State's  duties  by  reason  of  failure  to
    publish a Disability Equality Scheme (DES) and, more  specifically,  to
    carry out an impact assessment prior to removal in these cases.  It  is
    argued on behalf of the Secretary of State that the only body with  the
    power to enforce the duty of public authorities to have regard  to  the
    need to make positive efforts to promote the cause of disabled  persons
    and eliminate discrimination in carrying out their functions is now the
    Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).  Under  section  31(1)  of
    the Equality Act (EA) the Commission may assess the extent to which  or
    the manner in which a person has complied with  a  duty  by  virtue  of
    "...(a) section 48A or 49D of  the  DDA".   Section  32(2)  of  the  EA
    provides that if the  Commission  has  completed  an  assessment  under
    section 31 and thinks that a person has failed to comply with a section
    49A duty, it can give that person notice requiring him to  comply  with
    the said duty and give the Commission written  information,  within  28
    days, of the steps it  has  taken  or  proposes  for  the  purposes  of
    complying with  the  duty.   Under  section  32(8)  the  Commission  is
    empowered to apply to the court for an  order  requiring  a  person  to
    comply if it thinks they have failed to comply with the requirement  of
    the notice.  The relevant court by  subsection  32(9)  in  relation  to
    section 49A of the DDA is the High Court or in any other case a  county
    court.  Also it is provided by section 32(11) that  enforcement  action
    in relation to duties under section 49D can  only  be  brought  by  the
    Commission in the court specified in  section  32(8)  and  may  not  be
    brought in any other way.  It is argued therefore that  enforcement  of
    the duties created under section 49D is a matter for the EHRC  and  not
    the Tribunal.

247.  As regards the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State is otherwise not in accordance  with
    the law, it is argued that it is impermissible to rely upon Part III of
    the DDA in an appeal before the Tribunal.  Reference  is  made  to  the
    arguments set out above concerning the means by which the relevant part
    of the Act can be enforced.   It  is  also  argued  that  the  specific
    provisions of the DDA cannot be said to have been impliedly repealed or
    modified by the general provisions of the 2002 Act.

248.  In addition, with regard to any attempt to invoke sections 49A  and  D
    of the DDA, it is argued that the case law upon  which  the  appellants
    rely relates to the duty to make assessments before new  policies  etc.
    are introduced whereas in this case it is not  established  that  there
    has been any relevant change of practice on the part of  the  Secretary
    of State.  Further, it is argued that even if there had been  any  such
    failure, the issue  of  its  impact  upon  the  individual  immigration
    decisions in question in the appeals would clearly be a  disputed  one.
    Reference is made to the decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in  R(C)  v
    Secretary of State for Justice [2008] EWCA Civ 882, which  is  said  to
    show the ability of the High Court to tailor the discretionary remedies
    of, for example, quashing orders to the particular circumstances of the
    case, and also says nothing about whether or not  individual  decisions
    that might have been taken under relevant subordinate legislation  (the
    Secure Training Centre (Amendment) Rules 2007)  would  also  have  been
    quashed.  It is said that this is a situation which the Tribunal  would
    need to  address,  concerned  as  it  is  with  individual  immigration
    decisions, and that its jurisdiction to consider whether decisions  are
    "in accordance with the law" does not extend so far as to consider both
    whether a failure to conduct an impact assessment regarding the  effect
    of a policy would be unlawful, and then to consider the application  of
    any such general holding to the individual facts.  It is said that as a
    minimum the "policy" issue of the impact assessment  should  have  been
    litigated in the High Court by  way  of  an  application  for  judicial
    review.

249.  Thereafter the Secretary of State's submissions go on to  make  points
    concerning case law cited on  behalf  of  the  appellants  including  R
    (Chavda) v Harrow LBC [2007] EWHC 3604 and R  (Elias)  v  Secretary  of
    State for Defence [2005]  IRLR  788  which,  together  with  the  other
    authorities relied on by the appellants are said  not  to  support  the
    proposition that the DDA accords  adjudicative  responsibility  to  the
    Tribunal.  Comment is further made that the Tribunal is a  creature  of
    statute  and  unlike  the  High  Court  does  not  enjoy  any  inherent
    jurisdiction.

250.  In the appellants' response dated 15 April 2010,  the  point  is  made
    firstly that it is acknowledged on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State
    that judicial review is not precluded by section 25  of  the  DDA,  and
    breach of the statutory tort created by that section is of necessity an
    unlawful act.  This is of relevance to the argument that  the  decision
    is not in accordance with the law.  The simple  argument  is  that  the
    grounds of appeal are justiciable in this case because in  deciding  to
    remove the appellants the Secretary of State would be in breach of  the
    DDA and would thus not be acting "in accordance with the  law".   There
    is no claim for compensation or injunctive  relief  but  simply  it  is
    argued that the breach of the DDA  founds  a  ground  of  appeal  under
    sections 84(1)(e) and section 86(3) of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002.

251.  It is further argued that the  Race  Relations  Act  (RRA)  is  not  a
    helpful analogue in this context.  It is noted that  the  DDA  contains
    numerous exemptions to the unlawful acts created by  section  21B,  but
    that none concerns immigration decision making.  It is said  that  such
    decisions and ancillary functions therefore fall within section 21B  of
    the DDA but by contrast the RRA creates a quite different  regime.   It
    is said that necessarily almost all  immigration  decision  making  and
    functions would be unlawful under  the  RRA  given  the  definition  of
    "racial grounds" in that Act, but for the fact that, unlike in the DDA,
    almost all immigration decision making is excluded from the RRA.

252.  The point is further made that it would  be  unsatisfactory,  wasteful
    and contrary  to  Parliament's  intention  for  the  appellants  to  be
    required to pursue judicial review proceedings  in  parallel  with  the
    instant proceedings and also would result in duplication  of  cost  and
    process  and  create  a   risk   of   inconsistency   or   incoherence.
    Disagreement is also reiterated with the Secretary of State's  argument
    that Article 14 adds nothing to Article 3.   This  reinforces  previous
    points made on behalf of the appellants.

253.  With regard to the points made on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State
    concerning section 49A and the specific statutory duties under  section
    49D of the DDA,  the  submissions  made  above  are  repeated,  and  in
    addition it is argued that, though it is clearly the case that the EHRC
    has special powers to take enforcement action in respect of a breach of
    the statutory equality duties,  it  is  very  important  to  note  that
    section 32(11)  does  not  preclude  action  by  others  including  the
    invocation of the duties by individuals, and a  number  of  authorities
    including Elias, referred to  above,  are  relied  on.   The  point  is
    further made that the Secretary of State is wrong to argue that it  can
    be deduced from the fact that powers under sections 31 to 32 came  into
    force on 1 October 2007 that earlier case law can be explained  on  the
    basis that the powers were not then in force.  It is said that prior to
    that date a materially identical enforcement scheme was in place,  save
    that the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) carried  out  the  material
    functions now carried out by the EHRC.  Sections 31 to 32 replicate, it
    is said, the existing statutory scheme but take  account  of  the  fact
    that the DRC, together with other bodies such  as  the  Commission  for
    Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission  been  dissolved
    and replaced by the EHRC which has in  all  material  respects  assumed
    their powers.

254.  It is further argued that the suggestion that there is  a  distinction
    between the assessment of a new policy and  an  existing  policy  is  a
    distinction without a legal or principled basis.   The  point  is  made
    that the duty to impact  assess  policies  arises  in  respect  of  all
    policies, under regulation 2(3)(b)  of  the  Disability  Discrimination
    (Public  Authorities)   (Statutory   Duties)   Regulations   2005   (SI
    2005/2966).  It is clear that an assessment of the relevant policy  has
    not been undertaken,  and  it  is  also  emphasised  that  the  general
    disability duty under section 49A of the DDA applies  to  the  carrying
    out all of a public authority's functions.  It is said in  relation  to
    the decision in Elias that this was a case under  the  equality  duties
    under the RRA whose enforcement mechanism is  materially  identical  to
    those in the DDA  and  now  the  Equality  Act  2006.   The  fact  that
    jurisdictional points have  not  been  taken  so  far  in  the  various
    Divisional Court and Court of Appeal cases to which reference  is  made
    by the Secretary of State and including cases where the EHRC was itself
    a party, is said to be for the simple reason that this would be a  very
    bad point in law and that it is wholly improbable to suggest  that  the
    point had not been taken by the claimants in those cases the  EHRC  and
    the government departments and other public authorities  who  were  the
    subject of the duties of the proceedings, in error.  The point is  made
    that section 30 of the Equality Act 2006  gives  the  EHRC  a  specific
    legal power "to intervene in legal proceedings"  which  emphasises  the
    fact that it clearly has power to intervene in  judicial  review  cases
    and has regularly done so.   The  point  is  emphasised  that  the  law
    requires the Secretary of State to have  due  regard  to  the  equality
    objectives in section 49A of the DDA  and  that  this  is  achieved  by
    carrying out an equality impact assessment and that, although the  EHRC
    has exclusive enforcement powers over the duty to create and publish  a
    disability equality scheme, the same is not so of the general  equality
    duty under section 49A of the DDA which is generally enforceable as, it
    is said, the case law amply demonstrates and which has been violated in
    the instant case by the failure to have due regard as required.

    Discussion

Jurisdiction

255.  On the first issue, as we have said, we derive little assistance  from
    NM given the fact that the issue of jurisdiction was not  argued  there
    and, though we note the point made in the appellants' response that the
    doubts expressed by the Tribunal rather concerned the  extraterritorial
    effect of the DDA, which does not arise in  the  instant  appeals,  the
    absence of argument and detailed analysis means that we can derive  but
    limited assistance from that case.

256.  We turn to section 25 of the Disability Discrimination Act.  That,  as
    has been argued on behalf of the appellants, creates a  statutory  tort
    under which damages can be awarded for discrimination  and  proceedings
    in England and Wales should be brought only in a County Court.   It  is
    clear from Schedule 3, Part II, paragraph 5(2) that the  making  of  an
    application for judicial review is not precluded.

257.  We read the word "proceedings" in section 25(3) as referring  back  to
    the civil proceedings which are referred to in section 25(1) in respect
    of the process for breach of statutory duty that the section envisages.
     But we do not read it as ruling out other forms of relief, and  we  do
    not read those other forms of relief as limited  to  the  reference  to
    judicial review in the Schedule to which we have just referred.  It  is
    clear from the Treasury Solicitor's letter to the Tribunal of 26  March
    2010 that it is accepted on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State  that,
    subject to the statutory  limitations  contained  in  the  DDA  itself,
    sections 84 and 86 of the 2002 Act are wide enough to cover an argument
    that the decision was unlawful under the DDA.  We do not  read  section
    25 as precluding proceedings of the kind that are argued for before  us
    on the basis that the decisions of the  Secretary  of  State  in  these
    cases are "not in accordance with the law".  Clearly it is  right  that
    the Tribunal is a creature of statute and has no inherent jurisdiction,
    but equally clearly an appeal to the Tribunal under  section  82(1)  of
    the 2002 Act can be brought under subsection (1)(e) on the  basis  that
    the decision is otherwise not in accordance with the law.  It  has  not
    been suggested that the decisions in respect of the three appellants in
    this case do not fall within section 82 of the 2002 Act.   Clearly,  by
    dint of section 86(2)(a) we must  determine  any  matter  raised  as  a
    ground of appeal and therefore are required to consider whether or  not
    unless otherwise precluded, the decisions of the Secretary of State  in
    this case are not in accordance with the law.

258.  With regard to the point made on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    that a meaningful contrast can be made between  DDA  and  the  RRA,  we
    agree with the submissions made at  paragraph  13  of  the  appellants'
    response of 15 April 2010.  There is force, we think, to the point made
    that the DDA sets out a number  of  exceptions  to  the  unlawful  acts
    created by section 21B and none of those concerns immigration  decision
    making.  We agree that the regime created by the RRA  is  significantly
    different, in that, given the definition of "racial  grounds"  in  that
    Act, of necessity almost all immigration decision-making and  functions
    would be unlawful under the RRA but for the exclusion from the  RRA  of
    almost all immigration decision making, leaving residual  acts  falling
    within the RRA to be litigated in the Tribunal if a claim under the RRA
    for damages is pursued, and any decision  by  the  Tribunal  is  to  be
    binding.  Though it is not a knock-out point, we consider there is also
    relevance to the argument that it would be unsatisfactory for  parallel
    judicial review proceedings to be pursued at the  same  time  as  these
    proceedings.  It is not a point  of  interpretation  but  a  matter  of
    common sense which we think adds something to  the  arguments  made  on
    behalf of the appellants in this regard.  Accordingly we conclude  that
    on the first point on jurisdiction the argument made on behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State fails.

259.  We turn to the argument arising in respect of sections 49A and 49D  of
    the DDA.  Part of the argument made on behalf of the Secretary of State
    is that it is only the EHRC that has the power to enforce the duties of
    public authorities to have regard to the need to make positive  efforts
    to promote the cause of disabled people and eliminate discrimination in
    carrying out their functions.   There  is  also  the  point  concerning
    section 32(11) that we have set out above.

260.  The point is made in the appellants' written submissions that  section
    32(11) does not preclude action by others including individuals and the
    examples of Elias and also Brown v Secretary  of  State  for  Work  and
    Pensions [2008] EWHC 3158 are given.  Brown, in particular, shows  that
    an individual is not precluded from  challenging  by  way  of  judicial
    review under sections 49A and 49D of the DDA a  decision  of  a  public
    authority, in that case the Secretary of State for Work  and  Pensions,
    in respect, in that case, of the closure  of  a  Post  Office  and  its
    impact on Mrs Brown who is disabled.  This litigation took place  after
    October 2007, when sections 31 and 32 of the  Equality  Act  2006  came
    into force, but in any event, we accept the  point  made  at  paragraph
    17.1  of  the  appellants'  skeleton  submissions  that  the   previous
    enforcement scheme was essentially identical, save that the  Disability
    Rights Commission carried out the functions  now  carried  out  by  the
    EHRC.  As a consequence we conclude that, though enforcement action  in
    relation to section 49D duties can only be brought  by  the  Commission
    and Court specified in section 32(8) of  the  Equality  Act,  it  seems
    clear that other types of proceedings can be brought by individuals and
    presumably in the appropriate case other  bodies.   Again  we  consider
    that the argument that the decision is not otherwise in accordance with
    the law is a matter that is within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to
    determine.

261.   Accordingly  on  both  points  we  consider  that  the  Tribunal  has
    jurisdiction to deal with this type of claim arising in respect of  the
    Disability Discrimination Act.

Substantive Issues

262.  Under section 21B of the DDA it is unlawful for a public authority  to
    discriminate against a disabled person in carrying out  its  functions.
    Though there are a number of exceptions to the unlawful act created  by
    section 21B, as set out at paragraph 21C, immigration functions are not
    excluded.  Indeed they are specifically referred to as within the ambit
    of the legislation in the Code of Practice, Rights of Access:  Services
    to the Public, Public Authority Functions, Private Clubs  and  Premises
    (2006, DRC), which was issued under section 53(1)(a) of the DDA and  is
    admissible in legal proceedings.  Although these provisions  have  been
    repealed, they have been replaced by comparable  provisions  under  the
    Equality Act 2006, and in any event transitional arrangements apply and
    the Code remains effective.

263.  The concept of "discrimination" is defined at section 21D of the  DDA,
    and section 21E sets out in  detail  the  duties  that  exist  for  the
    purposes of section 21D(2) to make adjustments.

264.  On behalf of  the  appellants  it  is  argued  that  the  practice  of
    removing the appellants as failed asylum seekers would be a practice or
    policy triggering the duty to make reasonable adjustments if  it  makes
    it:

        "impossible or  unreasonably  difficult  for  disabled  persons  to
        receive any benefit that is or may be  conferred,  or  unreasonably
        adverse for disabled persons to experience  being  subject  to  any
        detriment to which a person is or may be subjected".

      It is also argued that the duty to make adjustments  is  a  compelling
    duty as set out in the Code of Practice, and it imposes a duty to  take
    such steps as are reasonable in all the circumstances of the  case  for
    it to have to take in order to make reasonable adjustments.   The  Code
    of Practice gives guidance as to  what  will  constitute  a  reasonable
    step, stating that it will:

        "vary according to:


           . the type of service being provided;

           . the nature of the service provided and its size and  resources;
             and

           . the  effect  of  the  disability  on  the  individual  disabled
             person."

265.  The Code of Practice also identifies  certain  factors  which  may  be
    taken into  account  in  considering  what  is  reasonable,  and  these
    include:

      .  whether  taking  any  particular  steps  would  be  effective   in
        overcoming the difficulty the disabled people face in accessing the
        service in question;

      . the extent to which it is practicable for the service  provider  to
        take steps;

      . the financial and other costs of making adjustment;

      . the extent of any disruption which taking the steps would cause;

      . the extent of the service provider's financial and other resources;

      . the amounts of any resources already spent on  making  adjustments;
        and

      . the availability of financial or other assistance.


    It is said that a decision not to remove in  the  instant  cases  would
    clearly constitute a reasonable step.

266.  As regards a possible justification for a failure to comply  with  the
    duty to make reasonable adjustments, it  is  suggested  that  the  most
    relevant prima  facie  basis  for  this  is  to  be  found  in  section
    21D(4)(d), but again with reference to the  Code  of  Practice,  it  is
    argued that the public authority can only justify treating  a  disabled
    person less favourably, or failing  to  comply  with  a  duty  to  make
    reasonable adjustments, where this is necessary for the  protection  of
    the rights and freedoms of other people.  It is argued that  it  cannot
    be said by the Secretary of State that removal  is  necessary  for  the
    protection of rights and freedoms of other persons.

267.  As to any  potential  argument  in  respect  of  section  21D(5),  the
    proportionality argument, here, again with reference  to  the  Code  of
    Practice, it is argued on behalf of the appellants that, in  the  words
    of the Code of Practice:

        ".  there is a pressing policy need that supports the aim which  the
            treatment  is  designed  to  achieve,  and  it  is  therefore  a
            "legitimate" aim; and

           . the authority's action is causally related  to  achieving  that
             aim; and

           . there was no other  way  to  achieve  the  aim  that  had  less
             detrimental impact on the rights of disabled people."

268.  It is suggested that though the legitimate aim here may be said to  be
    the preservation of the available NHS services for  HIV  sufferers  who
    have leave to remain in the UK independent of  their  HIV  status,  the
    mere identification of a legitimate  aim  will  not  be  sufficient  in
    itself, as is made clear in the Code of  Practice  and  with  reference
    also to the decision in Alan and Others v GMB  [2008]  IRLR  690.   The
    means chosen to achieve that aim must be proportionate and it  is  said
    that this requires consideration of whether there are alternative means
    of achieving that aim, and it requires a balancing between  the  impact
    on the appellants and the interests of the Secretary of State.   It  is
    argued that, since the impact of removal on  the  appellants  would  be
    very severe and life-threatening and in the circumstances will  involve
    a real risk of  violation  of  their  rights  under  the  Human  Rights
    Convention, the Secretary of  State  cannot  discharge  the  burden  of
    establishing justification.

269.  On behalf of the Secretary of State  four  points  are  made  on  this
    issue.  Firstly it is argued that the public  authority  providing  any
    "benefit" to a disabled person is a different authority from that which
    is carrying out the function in question, referring to what is said  at
    section 21E(1) of the Act.  It is argued that the  Secretary  of  State
    and a primary care  trust  could  not  be  considered  as  "one  public
    authority" on an ordinary construction given their different  functions
    and also the fact that they are listed separately  under  the  list  of
    "public authorities" who are made subject to the duty under section 49D
    of the Act to publish an equality scheme.

270.   Secondly  it  is  argued  that  there  is  not  a  sufficient  causal
    connection between the Secretary of State's functions  or  actions  and
    the detriment that  may  or  will  be  suffered  following  removal  to
    Zimbabwe.  It is argued that there must be  a  real  causal  connection
    between the source of the detriment and the  functions  of  the  public
    authority which is said to lead to exposure to the detriment.

271.  Thirdly it  is  argued  that  the  incorporation  of  the  concept  of
    reasonableness in section 21D and section 21E has to take into  account
    the substantial body of ECHR and domestic case law defining  the  scope
    of the state's  obligations  towards  non-nationals  without  leave  to
    remain in medical treatment in similar cases.  It  is  argued  that  if
    that were not the case the rulings  of  the  European  Court  would  be
    bypassed and those who were disabled could rely upon the DDA to provide
    a lower hurdle than the exceptional case test applicable in  Article  3
    cases.  The point is also made in this regard that it  is  relevant  to
    have regard to the cost implications of the "adjustments"  said  to  be
    required, quoting from what was said by the Court of Human Rights in N.
     Reference is made to the arguments made in respect of the  submissions
    on the issues on Article 3 and Article 8 considered above.  It is  also
    noted that the Tribunal in NM (Disability discrimination)  Iraq  [2008]
    UKAIT 00026 had serious doubts as to the extraterritorial effect of the
    DDA and it is contended that the situation in Zimbabwe is not a  matter
    for which the United Kingdom is responsible  and  so  similar  concerns
    about the de facto extraterritorial reach of the  statutory  duties  as
    arose in Soering in the context of Article 3 are also relevant in  this
    regard.  Hence the extraterritorial nature of the "detriment" to  which
    the appellants say they will be subject if removed is a highly material
    factor.

272.  Fourthly reference is made to the justification provisions at  section
    21D(3)  and  section  21D(5).   It  is  argued  that  both   of   these
    justifications apply because for the United Kingdom government to allow
    disabled persons who did not possess leave to remain, to remain in  the
    United Kingdom so they did not suffer  a  significant  decline  in  the
    standard of medical and related care on  return  to  their  country  of
    origin would impose a disproportionate cost and burden upon the  finite
    funds of the UK government and this draining of resources would further
    inevitably impact upon the rights and freedoms of UK citizens and those
    with leave who would otherwise have access to  the  medical  facilities
    and trained staff available for medical treatment.  The point  is  also
    made that the process  of  removal  only  occurs  once  the  person  in
    question has exhausted all their appeal  rights  and  it  would  entail
    therefore that they had not succeeded  in  respect  of  Article  3  and
    Article 8.  As regards the latter, the point is  made  that  issues  of
    proportionality would already have been considered and that factor  may
    be regarded as part of the DDA assessment.  It is argued in  conclusion
    that the legitimate objectives of a fair system of immigration  control
    require the consistent application of the Secretary of State's  current
    policy, which incorporates the Strasbourg jurisprudence threshold.

273.  In their response  to  these  submissions,  the  appellants  say  with
    regard to the first point that this misunderstands the trigger for  the
    duty and the point is made that section 21E(1) of the DDA only sets the
    threshold for triggering the duty and so sets a low  threshold.   There
    is no requirement that it should be:

        "impossible or  unreasonably  difficult  for  disabled  persons  to
        receive any benefit that is or may  be  conferred  by  that  public
        authority or (b)  unreasonably  adverse  for  disabled  persons  to
        experience being subject to a detriment to which a person is or may
        be subjected by that public authority, by the  carrying  out  of  a
        function by the authority"

      as, it is  contended,  Parliament  would  have  said  if  it  intended
    section 21E(1) to bear the meaning contended for by  the  Secretary  of
    State.  The reason for this is, it is said,  because  this  is  a  duty
    designed to secure that the acts of public authorities  do  not  unduly
    disadvantage disabled people and is adjusted  where  appropriate,  even
    though the disadvantage experienced by removal  or  the  conferring  of
    status such as ILR will usually arise not from the decision itself, but
    from the consequences for which other authorities and indeed  sometimes
    other states will be responsible.

274.  As regards the second point made by the  Secretary  of  State,  it  is
    argued that section 21E of the Act anticipates a  causal  link  between
    the acts of the respondent and the  disadvantage  and  the  disability.
    The duty is directed at disabled persons.  The act of removal  will  be
    causally linked,  though  it  will  not  be  the  only  cause,  to  the
    particular disadvantage and disability which is self-evidently causally
    connected to the disadvantage.

275.  With regard to the third issue this is said to lack any merit at  all.
     Section 21E, it is said, sets a low threshold, as opposed to the  high
    threshold in Article 3 cases and in the case of Article  8  only  where
    the treatment alleged is not justified.  It  is  argued  that  the  low
    threshold set by section 21E is set only for the purposes of triggering
    the reasonable adjustments duty, and to set an  Article  3/8  threshold
    for the mere triggering of the  duty  would  make  the  requirement  of
    reasonableness otiose.  It is argued that the Code of Practice makes it
    quite clear that the duty is triggered simply where  "disabled  people"
    would otherwise "have a worse experience in relation to the exercise of
    these functions than other people".

276.  With regard to the Secretary of State's last point, it is argued  that
    the Secretary of State faces a real struggle in this regard because  as
    is now admitted she has not undertaken an equality impact assessment to
    determine whether the decisions in these cases and  similar  cases  are
    necessary and proportionate  or  indeed  had  regard  to  the  equality
    objectives in section  49A  of  the  Act  with  which  the  defence  of
    justification must be read.  It is  not  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State  that  she  has  complied  with  the  duty  to  make
    reasonable adjustments by  making  such  adjustments.   Hence,  if  the
    Tribunal were to conclude that the duty was triggered, having regard to
    the other submissions made on behalf of  the  appellants,  then  unless
    justified the failure would mean that the Secretary of State had  acted
    unlawfully.   For  the   failure   to   be   legally   justified,   the
    discrimination must be justified under  section  21D(3)  and  (4),  and
    there is no evidence that the conditions for establishing justification
    are met in this case and no evidence has been  adduced  on  the  issue.
    Quite apart from the absence  of  an  equality  impact  assessment,  it
    appeared that there had been no consideration or any thought  given  to
    whether the discrimination was justified at all prior to the hearing of
    the case.   This  would  mean  that  the  discrimination  was,  if  not
    impossible, extremely difficult to justify and in this case  impossible
    given the absence of any evidence at all.  Reference is  made  to  what
    was said by the Supreme Court in R (E) v  Governing  Body  of  JFS  and
    Another (United Synagogue and Others intervening) [2009] UKSC 15.

Discussion

277.  The duty to make reasonable adjustments as set out at section  21E  of
    the DDA does, in our view, link the practice, policy or procedure of  a
    public authority to the impact on disabled persons of the carrying  out
    of a function by the authority.  It is true, as is argued on behalf  of
    the appellants, that it does not say "by that  public  authority",  but
    equally nor does it say "by any  public  authority".   By  use  of  the
    definite article we see the link here required to  exist  as  contended
    for on behalf of the Secretary of State.  Again, we consider  that  the
    words "any benefit" in section 21E(1)(a) and "any detriment" in (b) are
    properly to be regarded  as  referring  to  any  benefit  or  detriment
    arising as a consequence of the carrying  out  of  a  function  of  the
    particular authority which has the practice,  policy  or  procedure  in
    question.  As is argued on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  the
    function of a primary healthcare trust is a very different matter  from
    the obligations of a government department such as the Home Office, and
    it is not without relevance that  the  two  are  listed  separately  in
    Schedule 1 of the 2005 Regulations.  It would have been  easy  for  the
    legislation to make it  clear  that  there  was  a  potential  division
    between the authority which has the practice, policy  or  procedure  in
    question and the one the  carrying  out  of  whose  function  adversely
    impacts on disabled persons, but that was not done and we consider that
    therefore the argument of the Secretary of State in this regard is made
    out.

278.  With regard to the second issue, since we consider it is necessary  to
    go and consider all four of these points, we see  force  in  the  point
    made on behalf of the appellants.  If it were the case,  which  clearly
    from the previous paragraph we do not accept,  that  the  Secretary  of
    State's practice policy or procedure could give rise to a breach of the
    Act and therefore arguably would not be in  accordance  with  the  law,
    then there would be a causal connection between that and the impact  on
    the particular person on removal.  As is said at paragraph 21.2 of  the
    appellants' further submissions, the practice of the  respondent  would
    be causally linked, though not the only cause.   We  do  not  read  the
    legislation as requiring it to be the only or the  dominant  cause  but
    simply to be causally linked and we think the point made on  behalf  of
    the appellants in this regard is made out.

279.  As regards the third issue, again we see force in the points  made  on
    behalf of the appellants.  The concept of reasonableness arising  under
    section 21D(2)(a), essentially replicated at section 21E(1) in our view
    involves the need to assess that reasonableness on  the  basis  of  the
    circumstances of the case rather than of necessity linking it  to  ECHR
    case law on Article 3 and Article 8.  However, it is not irrelevant  to
    take account of the point made at paragraph  47  of  the  Secretary  of
    State's submissions concerning such matters as the  costs  implications
    of the "adjustments" said to be required.  The reasoning behind some of
    the arguments put forward in respect of Article 3 and Article 8 is  not
    without relevance in this  regard,  but  the  case  law  comes  from  a
    somewhat different context.  It is concerned with removal  rather  than
    the triggering of an obligation under section 21E.  Again, however,  it
    is not irrelevant to take account of the  further  point  made  by  the
    Secretary of State at paragraph 50 of the further submissions that  the
    Secretary of State is being asked to react to  and  thus  to  assume  a
    measure of responsibility for,  conditions  in  a  third  country.   In
    particular, it may be said  that  nothing  in  the  Act  suggests  that
    Parliament intended it to have extraterritorial effect.   If  a  person
    who comes within the scope of the  legislation  while  she  is  in  the
    United Kingdom leaves the country, including the situation where she is
    removed compatibly with the immigration laws and the  United  Kingdom's
    international treaty obligations, that may properly be said to  be  the
    end of the government's responsibilities under the  Act.   Further,  we
    see force to the argument in effect that the practice of the  Secretary
    of State does not make it unreasonably difficult for the appellants  to
    receive any benefit that is or may be conferred.  Factors such  as  the
    extraterritoriality point and the costs point are of relevance  to  the
    issue of reasonableness in this context.  We  also  see  force  to  the
    submission that it would not be reasonable to require the Secretary  of
    State to adjust his policies on removal to avoid the anticipated effect
    by ceasing removal action.

280.  On the fourth and  final  point,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the
    justification provision in particular as set out at  section  21D(4)(d)
    and also section 21D(5).

281.  We do not agree with the submission made on behalf of  the  appellants
    that the absence of an equality impact assessment  makes  it  extremely
    difficult  for  the  Secretary  of   State   to   argue   justification
    successfully.  It seems to us that it is open to the Secretary of State
    to argue, as she has done, that the treatment  or  non-compliance  with
    the duty is necessary for the protection  of  rights  and  freedoms  of
    other persons, as argued at paragraph 56 of the  Secretary  of  State's
    further submissions.  There is force to the argument that  if  disabled
    people without leave to remain are permitted  to  stay  in  the  United
    Kingdom so they do not suffer a significant decline in the standard  of
    medical related care upon return to their country of origin this  would
    impose a disproportionate cost and burden upon the limited funds of the
    United Kingdom government.  Again there is  force  to  the  point  that
    there would be  an  inevitable  further  impact  upon  the  rights  and
    freedoms of UK citizens and persons with leave who would otherwise have
    access to the  medical  facilities  and  trained  staff  available  for
    medical treatment.  Likewise, we consider it is open to  the  Secretary
    of State to argue that her acts giving rise allegedly to the  treatment
    or failure are a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.  In
    this regard also we see some force to the point made on behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State that if it has been decided, as we  have  concluded,
    that there would be no breach of the appellants' Article  8  rights  in
    removing them, then this is clearly  relevant  to  the  proportionality
    aspect of section 21D(5).  We do not see the need for evidence in  this
    regard.  It is a matter essentially of legal  argument;  the  arguments
    have been made and we prefer the argument of the  Secretary  of  State.
    The circumstances that we have set out above  and  the  arguments  made
    above  seem  to  us  to  provide  ample  justification  of  the  point.
    Accordingly we agree with the Secretary of State's submissions in  this
    regard, and therefore in sum for the reasons set out we  conclude  that
    there is no failure to act in accordance with the law on  the  part  of
    the Secretary of State in respect of duties arising under section 21 of
    the DDA.

UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities

282.  It is argued that the international law obligations created by the  UN
    Convention  on  the  Rights  of   Persons   with   Disabilities   ("the
    Convention") are relevant both in their own right and also to issues of
    proportionality under the DDA.  Article 5 of the Convention states:

         "1.      States Parties recognise that all persons are equal before
             and under the law and are entitled without any  discrimination
             to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law.


         2. States Parties shall prohibit all discrimination on the basis of
             disability and guarantee to persons  with  disabilities  equal
             and effective legal protection against discrimination  on  all
             grounds.


         3. In order  to  promote  equality  and  eliminate  discrimination,
             States Parties shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that
             reasonable accommodation is provided.


         4. Specific measures which are necessary to accelerate  or  achieve
             de facto equality of persons with disabilities  shall  not  be
             considered discrimination  under  the  terms  of  the  present
             Convention."

            Article 25 recognises "that persons with disabilities  have  the
    right to the enjoyment of the highest  attainable  standard  of  health
    without discrimination on the basis of disability", and requires States
    Parties to "take all appropriate measures to ensure access for  persons
    with  disabilities  to  health  services  that  are   gender-sensitive,
    including health-related rehabilitation".

283.  The United Kingdom ratified the Convention on 8  June  2009,  and  its
    Optional Protocol on 7 August 2009.  However, it has entered  a  number
    of reservations in respect of the Convention, including the following:

         "The United Kingdom reserves the right to apply  such  legislation,
         insofar as it relates to the entry into, stay in and departure from
         the United Kingdom of those who do not have the right under the law
         of the United Kingdom to enter and remain in the United Kingdom, as
         it may deem necessary from time to time."

284.  The point  is  made  on  behalf  of  the  appellants  that  a  similar
    reservation with respect to immigration, initially made by  the  UK  to
    Article 22 of the UN Convention on the Rights of  the  Child  ("UNCRC")
    was withdrawn in September 2008, following criticism  by  a  number  of
    bodies, including the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR),  and  the
    JCHR has said that the reservation is very similar  to  that  initially
    made in respect of the UNCRC, nevertheless it  is  the  case  that  the
    reservations in respect of the Convention have not been withdrawn.

285.  The point is also made on behalf of the appellants that  Zimbabwe  has
    neither signed nor ratified the Convention and it is  argued  that  the
    evidence of discrimination concerning the availability  of  ARVs  would
    clearly violate the fundamental principles  of  the  Convention  and  a
    decision not  to  remove  the  appellants  would  make  sure  that  the
    Secretary of State complies with her international law  obligations  as
    contained in the Convention.

286.  This does not however in our view give  rise  to  a  legal  obligation
    justiciable per se before this Tribunal.  It  is  entirely  unclear  on
    what basis the Secretary of State might be said to have assumed a legal
    obligation not to remove the appellants to a state failing to meet such
    international obligations, especially in light of the reservation.   As
    is pointed out at paragraph 125 of the  Secretary  of  State's  written
    submissions, the nature and extent of the obligations not to  remove  a
    person to a place where the "recipient" state may breach  international
    obligations or tenets are set out in Soering and arise under Article  3
    of the European Human Rights Convention.  Accordingly we conclude  that
    there is no issue justiciable per se before this Tribunal arising  from
    any breach of the terms of the Convention.  Nor do we consider that the
    UK's obligations, reserved in  this  context  as  they  currently  are,
    materially impact on the issues of proportionality under the DDA.

Decisions on the Individual Appellants

RS

287.  We have set out RS's evidence above.

288.  We remind ourselves that, though  the  appellant  first  came  to  the
    country in February 2001, it was not until 2004, at  the  time  of  her
    appeal against the decision refusing leave to remain to undergo private
    medical treatment, that she claimed that she and her family had  always
    been MDC supporters.  She claimed asylum in March 2006 and  claimed  to
    have been active for the MDC since its formation in 1999,  and  claimed
    that her husband was also involved, as were  her  family  members,  and
    that her husband and her sisters were known to the authorities  as  MDC
    members.  She claimed to have attended rallies and distributed T-shirts
    and other items, to have sold cards, and to have  been  arrested  three
    times, at each time in the year 2000.  Only  the  human  rights  issues
    were considered at the subsequent appeal and  the  asylum  issues  have
    never been determined.

289.  In her statement of January 2010 she claimed for the first  time  that
    she and her husband were arrested for distributing T-shirts and selling
    cards and leaflets.  Initially she had  only  referred  to  herself  as
    having been arrested on that occasion.  She said that her sister-in-law
    was also arrested with them and  was  raped  by  the  police,  and  she
    herself was touched inappropriately.  She said she did not mention this
    in her 2004 statement because the application was only  concerned  with
    her ill health but in the January 2010 statement did not explain why it
    was omitted from the 2006 statement which was specifically prepared for
    her asylum appeal.  She referred to two other occasions  when  she  and
    her husband were held overnight.  She said that her brother-in-law  was
    killed in a house fire  in  2002  because  he  was  an  MDC  supporter.
    Previously she had said that this occurred in 2004.

290.  The appellant said in her statement that her  husband,  her  children,
    her husband's sister and her children survive on US$10 a month and  are
    denied food aid due to their MDC connections.  They had been beaten  by
    ZANU-PF thugs in 2004 and 2008 during the time  of  the  elections  and
    sometimes had to go into hiding in order to be safe.   She  was  unsure
    whether her husband had been arrested since returning in 2002.  In  the
    last few months he had been bedridden.  Like her he had been  diagnosed
    as HIV positive in August 2001.  He went back to Zimbabwe in 2002.  The
    appellant said that her father died in 2004 and  her  mother  in  2005.
    She said her mother-in-law was supported by relatives in  the  USA  and
    did not share the money with the appellant's husband.

291.  In oral evidence the appellant adopted the three appeal statements  as
    true and accurate.  She was reminded that she had  at  one  stage  said
    that  her  husband  was  not  politically  active   or   targeted   for
    persecution, in contrast to her later evidence that she and her  family
    had always been supporters of the MDC.  She was asked why she  had  not
    mentioned this in the context of the earlier  human  rights  claim  and
    said she had been dealing with the medical claim first time and  raised
    asylum when she made her second claim.  She said she could not remember
    being asked in the context of her first appeal whether her husband  had
    any political involvement.  When asked why she made no mention  in  her
    first witness statement of being detained, she said she  had  not  been
    asked about it.  As regards discrepancies in her written evidence as to
    the duration of the detention in 2000, she said  that  she  might  have
    mixed up the dates and that one of the detentions lasted two hours  and
    another was overnight.

292.  As regards evidence that her home and property had been destroyed,  in
    a letter signed by the Provincial Youth Secretary and the Secretary  of
    the MDC for Chitungwiza Province, whereas she had not mentioned this in
    any of her other evidence, she said that she  had  mentioned  that  the
    house she lived in was destroyed  and  this  was  a  reference  to  her
    brother-in-law's  house  being  destroyed  in  2004.   As  regards  the
    reference in the letter to her being hunted by ZANU-PF officials  which
    she had not mentioned in her statements, she said  that  when  she  had
    been distributing leaflets she had been told she would be  arrested  if
    caught again and that was what she had meant.  She confirmed that Dema,
    where her home is,  is  an  MDC  stronghold  and  that  there  were  no
    hospitals there nor in  Chitungwiza.   Her  husband  was  ill  and  not
    politically active.  He was not receiving any  medical  treatment.   He
    had not received any treatment since returning to Zimbabwe.

293.  We find the appellant's claim of MDC involvement of  herself  and  her
    family to lack credibility.  We do not find  credible  the  explanation
    she gives for not having mentioned the fact that she and her family had
    always been MDC supporters at the time of her human rights  claim.   If
    she had experienced the problems she claims to have experienced in 2000
    it lacks  credibility  that  she  would  not  have  referred  to  these
    incidents at the time of her initial application for leave  to  remain.
    It also lacks credibility that  her  husband  would  have  returned  to
    Zimbabwe in 2002, even though it was after the death of his father,  if
    he had experienced the arrests and ill-treatment that  she  now  claims
    that he had experienced.  Accordingly, as we say, we do not accept  the
    appellant's claim that she and her family have had any involvement with
    the MDC.  She would therefore return to Zimbabwe  as  a  failed  asylum
    seeker with  no  adverse  history  with  the  authorities.   We  remind
    ourselves that in RN it  was  said  at  paragraph  230  that  a  person
    returning to their home area from the United Kingdom as a failed asylum
    seeker will not generally be at risk on that account alone, although in
    some cases that may in fact be sufficient to give rise to a real  risk.
    Each case will turn on its own facts and the  particular  circumstances
    of the individual are to be assessed as a whole.   It  is  relevant  in
    this regard to bear in mind the appellant's evidence that  Dema,  where
    her family live, is an MDC stronghold.  In line with the guidance in RN
    we consider that the appellant has not shown she faces a real  risk  on
    return to Zimbabwe either at the airport or in her home area on account
    of actual or suspected political beliefs.   We  also  find  lacking  in
    credibility the family's claim  not  to  have  been  included  in  food
    distribution and her husband in medication  distribution  when  he  has
    been back in Zimbabwe now for some eight years, having  been  diagnosed
    as HIV positive in 2001.  We do not find it credible  that  the  family
    can have existed for such a lengthy period without food aid and, in the
    case of the  appellant's  husband,  medication.   We  do  not  find  it
    credible  that  the  appellant's  mother-in-law,  who  is  said  to  be
    supported by relatives in the United States of America, does not  share
    the money with the appellant's husband.

294.  We have set out above our findings on risk on account of  a  diagnosis
    of being HIV positive which all these appellants have.  We have set out
    above the medical evidence concerning RS.  Dr Day  considered,  putting
    the position at its starkest, that if medication stopped completely  he
    would expect her life expectancy  to  be  less  than  five  years.   In
    accordance in particular with the guidance in N, we conclude  that  the
    appellant has not shown a real risk of  breach  of  her  Article  3  or
    Article 8 rights by reason of return to Zimbabwe and thus being  denied
    the access to medication that she  is  presently  receiving.   We  have
    noted that there is a significant number of people receiving  treatment
    for HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe.  Quite apart from the case on its  facts  not
    crossing the N threshold, we consider there is a  good  chance  of  the
    appellant obtaining access to the necessary medication.

295.  We have also set out our views  above  concerning  discrimination  and
    politicisation of access to AIDS treatment  and  therapy  in  Zimbabwe.
    Particularly in an area which is an MDC stronghold, such as Dema, we do
    not consider that the claim in this regard  is  made  out  either.   We
    maintain our view that  in  general  there  is  not  such  a  level  of
    discrimination and politicisation in this regard as to give rise  to  a
    real risk in general in  Zimbabwe.   Likewise,  given  our  conclusions
    above on access to food aid, we do not consider  that  the  appellant's
    claim in this regard is made out either.

296.  As regards other aspects of Article 8, the appellant has been  in  the
    United Kingdom for over  nine  years  now  and  has  clearly  therefore
    developed a private life, although little evidence  has  been  provided
    other than the fact of having been in the United  Kingdom  during  this
    period.  It does not seem to  us  that  either  her  removal  would  be
    disproportionate as regards private life, and as  regards  her  family,
    her husband and children are in Zimbabwe  as  also  are  her  husband's
    sister and her children.  Clearly therefore the heart of her family  is
    in Zimbabwe and our conclusion  is  that  her  removal   would  not  be
    disproportionate as a consequence, in respect of her family  life,  for
    her to be removed to Zimbabwe.  Her claim is dismissed on all grounds.

EC

297.  As we have set out in EC's history above, she was  born  in  Gutu  and
    grew up in Harare.  Her husband died last year  and  her  two  children
    live in Harare with her mother.  She has not  claimed  to  be  involved
    with the MDC or any other opposition parties either while  in  Zimbabwe
    or since she came to the United Kingdom.  She was  diagnosed  as  being
    HIV positive in late 2001 or early 2002.  She lives with  a  cousin  in
    the United Kingdom.  Her parents and brother are in  Zimbabwe  and  the
    family, she says, rely on a relative who provides them with maize.  She
    also has a sister  who  lives  with  her  mother-in-law.   Dr  Day  has
    reported on the appellant, stating in his most recent  report  that  if
    she were unable to receive a supply of drugs that controlled her  virus
    then her life expectancy would be limited to  less  than  three  years.
    She had originally come to London to stay with an uncle who  worked  in
    the Zimbabwe High Commission  here.   She  said  that  he  returned  to
    Zimbabwe in 2005 and though she had not really tried  to  make  contact
    with him she had a cousin in Harare who was  his  niece  and  whom  she
    could contact about him.  By the time of the hearing she was not living
    with her cousin but living with a friend from church.

298.  EC would return as a failed asylum seeker who has been in  the  United
    Kingdom since September 2001 and has no record of political involvement
    either while in Zimbabwe or while in the United Kingdom.  On the  basis
    of the guidance in RN, we consider that her  claim  is  not  made  out.
    Whether or not she is  able  to  renew  contact  with  the  cousin  she
    initially came to visit, we consider, taking the evidence as  a  whole,
    that she would not face a real risk on return.  Harare is  an  area  of
    strong MDC support, and it  is  to  Harare  that  the  appellant  would
    return.  We conclude that she does not face a real risk of  persecution
    or breach of her Article 3 rights on return.  The findings we have  set
    out  above  concerning  risk  on  account  of  politicised  access   to
    medication and food aid apply equally to EC as to the other appellants.
     As regards the issue of her life expectancy if denied  medication,  we
    rely on what we have said above about the application of  the  decision
    of the Court of Appeal in N, but in any event remind ourselves  of  the
    significant numbers of  people  in  Zimbabwe  who  are  in  receipt  of
    HIV/AIDS medication.

299.  As regards other aspects of Article 8, the appellant has, as  we  say,
    been in the United Kingdom for nearly nine years.  That must give  rise
    to private life and it seems clear that she has friends in  the  United
    Kingdom and cousins also.  However we do not consider her removal would
    be disproportionate in respect of her private  life,  nor,  bearing  in
    mind that her two children live  in  Harare  with  her  mother,  do  we
    consider that the appellant's family life would  be  disproportionately
    interfered with by  her  removal.   Her  appeal  is  dismissed  on  all
    grounds.

BR

300.  BR is from Chitungwiza Town which is described as an  MDC  stronghold.
    She has  been  in  the  United  Kingdom  since  December  2001  (having
    previously visited for some three weeks  earlier  in  that  year),  and
    lives with her daughter M.  She has another daughter, S, also living in
    the United  Kingdom.   It  is  unclear  where  S's  two  children,  who
    accompanied the appellant to the United Kingdom in December 2001, are.

301.  BR discovered that she was suffering from HIV in June 2002.   Like  EC
    she does not claim a  history  of  political  engagement  or  political
    action.  The particular complication in her case as regards her  health
    is that due to a resistance she has to the  two  main  classes  of  HIV
    medication commonly  used,  she  is  on  a  complex  regimen  including
    Raltegravir, which is extremely expensive and, according to Dr Barnett,
    not available anywhere in Africa.  The most recent report on BR is from
    Dr Minton.  In an earlier report of 9 October 2009 Dr Minton said  that
    if BR were no longer able to obtain  her  current  medication  her  CD4
    count and general health would rapidly decline  and  she  would  become
    susceptible to severe infection and cancers.  He  does  not  appear  to
    have stated how long her life expectancy would be if denied her current
    medication.

302.  Taking the evidence in the round as concerns BR, we consider that  she
    has not shown a real risk  of  persecution  on  grounds  of  actual  or
    suspected political opinion.  She would return to Zimbabwe as a  failed
    asylum seeker who had been in the United Kingdom for  over  nine  years
    but  without  any  political  history.   She  would  be  returning   to
    Chitungwiza, an MDC stronghold, and she has four  sisters  in  Zimbabwe
    who live with their families.  Applying the guidance in RN, we consider
    that her circumstances do not show any  real  risk  of  persecution  or
    Article 3 ill-treatment on ground of perceived political opinion.

303.  We reiterate what we have said above about risk on account of  limited
    access or no access to medication in  Zimbabwe.   We  remind  ourselves
    that a significant number of people in Zimbabwe do have access to  AIDS
    medication.  There is the particular difficulty we have noted above  in
    BR's case of her need for Raltegravir which we accept she would not  be
    able to receive in Zimbabwe.  However, bearing in mind the guidance  of
    the  Court  of  Appeal  in  N,  we  consider  that,  though  this  must
    significantly impact on the health and life expectancy of BR,  that  it
    does not cross the Article 3 threshold.

304.  As regards the Refugee Convention and Article 3 claims in  respect  of
    claimed politicisation of access to medication and  food,  we  rely  on
    what we have set out above about these matters in general terms.  It is
    of relevance in BR's case again that she comes from an  MDC  stronghold
    and therefore any risk that might exist on account of politicisation is
    on our view of the background evidence not of a level such as  to  give
    rise to a real risk of breach of her rights.

305.  As regards other aspects of Article 8 and the  health  and  access  to
    food issues, it is clearly the case that BR enjoys family  and  private
    life in the United Kingdom.  She lives with one of  her  daughters  and
    her other daughter also lives in the United Kingdom.  The  evidence  of
    her daughter M is that she looked for her maternal  aunts  in  Zimbabwe
    when she returned there in 2009 but was unable to find them.  We accept
    therefore that BR would return to Zimbabwe without family support.   In
    the current circumstances, it is clear that she would not be joined  in
    Zimbabwe by either of her daughters and therefore the family  life  she
    enjoys with them would be adversely affected as a consequence.  However
    she is an adult and they are adults, and the evidence does not  show  a
    degree of dependency by her on them beyond what is normally expected in
    the case of a mother and her adult daughters.  Accordingly we  conclude
    her removal would not be disproportionate, and her appeal is  dismissed
    on all grounds.
