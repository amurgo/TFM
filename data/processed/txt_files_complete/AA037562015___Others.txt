Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Asjad promulgated  5.6.15,  dismissing  on  all  grounds
    their linked appeals against he decisions of the Secretary of State  to
    refuse their asylum, humanitarian protection and human  rights  claims.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 19.5.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Shimmin  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.8.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley granted permission to appeal.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 18.4.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. After hearing the submissions of Ms Duru and Mrs Pettersen, I  reserved
    my decision on error of law, which I now give.

 5. For the reasons set out below, I find no error of law in the making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision
    of Judge Asjad to be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    appellants  are  Iranian  nationals   and   comprise   husband   (first
    appellant), his wife and their infant son, born in Australia  in  2013.
    After completing military service and university  education  the  first
    appellant worked as a civil engineer. He was granted a visa to study  a
    Masters course in Australia. Their son was born with  a  defected  hand
    and their lives became difficult such that they decided  to  return  to
    Iran for family support.

 7. On return to Iran the first appellant claims that he  was  interrogated
    about the reasons he was in Australia and accused of  cooperation  with
    anti-Islamic republic government  activity  and  working  for  Zionism,
    engaging in anti-national security activities against the  regime,  all
    of which he denied. He was held in detention for 87 days  before  being
    granted 3 days on bail, but not told when and where to return. He  used
    an agent to leave Iran and come to the UK,  arriving  on  16.11.13  and
    immediately claimed asylum. He claimed asylum on the basis  of  imputed
    political opinion. Not raised with the Secretary of State, but only  on
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal he claimed to be a Christian  convert
    from Islam. He also claims to be at risk on return because  of  illegal
    exit.

 8. The Secretary  of  State  considered  it  implausible  that  the  first
    appellant was detained by the Iranian authorities on  return  and  does
    not accept he is at any risk on return.

 9. The grounds  first  argue  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made
    credibility findings not supported by the evidence, and  secondly  that
    the judge failed to take relevant evidence into account.

10. In relation to the first ground, complaint is made that the judge found
    that the first appellant's motive for coming to the UK  was  linked  to
    obtaining treatment for his son's disability and that the level of care
    in the UK was not available in Iran or  Australia.  It  said  that  the
    child does not have any medical condition requiring  attention  and  he
    has not accessed any treatment in the UK. It is argued that  since  the
    first appellant had a 3 year visa to  study  in  Australia,  which  was
    still valid, there was no need for him to come to claim asylum  in  the
    UK.

11. In relation to the second ground, complaint  is  made  that  the  judge
    failed to  apply  country  background  evidence  which  post-dates  the
    Country Guidance case law of SB (risk on return -illegal exit) Iran  CG
    [2009] UKAIT 00053, and BA (demonstrators in Britain - risk on  return)
    Iran CG [2011] UKUT 00036 (IAC), to the effect that  on  return  failed
    asylum seekers may be interrogated, detained and mistreated, whether or
    not they have been political activists in Iran or abroad, referring  to
    what are by now rather well-known references in the  COIR  of  2013  to
    published reports and an article by an unnamed judge in Iran.

12. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Chalkley stated that he did not
    wish to raise the appellant's hopes but thought that  it  was  possible
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge may have erred. Judge  Chalkley  did
    not explain in what regard he considered the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal to be arguably made in error of law.

13. I note that Judge Shimmin had refused  permission  to  appeal,  finding
    that the judge had made findings that the appellant  is  not  credible,
    fully justified by proper and strong reasoning, and that in relation to
    risk on return the Judge had followed the  county  guidance  case  law,
    considering that the country background evidence  is  not  sufficiently
    strong to warrant departing from the country guidance.

14. In the Rule 24 reply, it is submitted that the judge's conclusion  that
    the first appellant came to the UK for free health  care  was  entirely
    open, given the reliance on the severity of the  son's  condition,  for
    which reason they had left Australia and  returned  to  Iran,  and  the
    judge's credibility findings.

15. The judge specifically rejected the first appellant's  factual  claims,
    finding his account not credible; finding his account of  detention  to
    have been fabricated, and finding his claimed conversion contrived  and
    unsupported by any pastor or church member. The judge was  entitled  to
    rely on FS & others (Iran -Christian Converts)  Iran  CG  [2004]  UKAIT
    00303, cited at �25 of the decision, to the  effect  that  an  ordinary
    convert is not at real risk of  persecution  on  return  to  Iran.  The
    findings  are  cogently  reasoned  and  justified  by  the   discussion
    addressed in the decision.

16. There was no evidence as to health care in  Australia,  but  the  judge
    noted that the UK provides free health care  and  that  the  appellants
    left Australia because of their son's defect. Whether or not they  have
    accessed health care in the UK, the claimed asylum reason for coming to
    the  UK  was  rejected,  and  stands  independently  of   the   judge's
    observations about the appellants' motivation.

17. In essence this ground is no more than a disagreement with the  judge's
    clear and well-reasoned conclusions for rejecting the entirety  of  the
    first appellant's factual claim.

18. In relation to the risk on return as a failed asylum seeker  or  having
    made an illegal  exit,  and  the  appellants'  reliance  on  background
    information of potential risks, the Secretary of State relies on DSG  &
    Ors (Afghan Sikhs: Departure from CG) Afghanistan [2013], and SG (Iran)
    [2012] EWCA Civ 940,  where  it  was  held  that  unless  it  has  been
    expressly superseded or replace by any later CG  determination,  or  is
    inconsistent with other authority that is binding on the Tribunal, such
    a country guidance case is authority in any subsequent appeal, and that
    decision makers and  Tribunal  judges  are  required  to  take  country
    guidance determinations into account, and to follow them, "unless  very
    strong grounds supported by cogent evidence,  are  adduced,  justifying
    their not doing so. To do otherwise would amount to an error of law."

19. I agree with the submission of Ms  Pettersen  that  the  very  COI  and
    Amnesty  International  evidence  relied  on  by  the   appellants   is
    insufficient to displace the current country guidance relied on by  the
    judge. There are obvious shortcomings in the relied on passages. One is
    distinctly lacking in detail, with no examples  cited,  and  the  other
    refers to existing laws cited by an unnamed judge. These  two  articles
    or extracts post-date the CG, but on the test for  departing  from  CG,
    set out above, the judge considered the  objective  evidence  available
    and was entitled to follow the country guidance cases cited at �27. The
    background material cannot be  described  as  cogent  or  amounting  to
    strong grounds to depart from the country guidance.

20. Mrs Pettersen also points out, as the judge did at �23 that despite the
    serious charges the first appellant claims he faced, he was released on
    bail without any conditions and was able to plan  his  exit  from  Iran
    with his wife using her own passport.  The  judge  found  all  of  this
    implausible, particularly the speed with which it was accomplished, and
    ultimately not credible. Mrs Pettersen suggests that this must raise  a
    serious doubt as to whether  the  first  appellant  left  illegally  as
    claimed.

21. Much of Ms Duru's submissions consisted of rhetorical questions  as  to
    why a person with unexpired leave for Australia chose to come to the UK
    and live in destitution if not fleeing the Iranian authorities.  It  is
    not the role of the Tribunal to answer such questions, only to consider
    whether  the  findings  and  conclusions  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    involved an error of law. If not, I cannot interfere with the decision.
    It  may  be  that  a  different  judge  may  have  come  to   different
    conclusions, but I cannot agree with the submission that  the  decision
    of this judge was irrational or perverse. No material error of  law  is
    disclosed.

Conclusions:

22. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal  of  each  appellant  remains  dismissed  on  all
                    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an order. Given the circumstances, I continue  that  anonymity
order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
