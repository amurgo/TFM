                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Oliver promulgated on 12th August 2014.

 2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born 14th July 1973 who on 22nd
    January 2013 applied for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    Tier 1 (entrepreneur).  This was initially refused on 28th May 2013 and
    the Appellant appealed against that decision and an appeal hearing  was
    listed for 16th October 2013, but on the day  before  the  hearing  the
    Respondent withdrew that decision and on 4th April 2014  made  a  fresh
    decision to refuse to vary leave to remain and to remove the  Appellant
    from the United Kingdom.

 3. The refusal was based upon paragraph 322(1A)  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant had submitted a false document  with  his  application,  that
    being a letter from  Standard  Chartered  Bank  Wapda  Town  Branch  in
    Pakistan.  The Respondent was satisfied that the letter was  false,  as
    this had been confirmed by the  bank.   The  Respondent  was  therefore
    satisfied that the Appellant had used deception in his application.

 4. The application was also refused with reference to  paragraph  245DD(a)
    which provides that the application must not fall for refusal under the
    general Grounds of Refusal, and (b) which provides  that  an  applicant
    must have been awarded a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs 35 to 53
    of Appendix A.  The Appellant was not awarded any points under Appendix
    A, because he had not proved that he had access to ï¿½50,000 provided  by
    third party funding nor had he proved that the funds  were  held  in  a
    regulated financial institution nor that they were  disposable  in  the
    United Kingdom.  This was because the Appellant had submitted  a  false
    bank letter.

 5. The Respondent stated in the  refusal,  that  in  line  with  paragraph
    245DD(l) an assessment as detailed in paragraph 245DD(h) had  not  been
    carried out, and reserved the right to carry out such an assessment  if
    the refusal decision was challenged, or in a future application.

 6. The Appellant's appeal was heard by Judge Oliver (the  judge)  on  17th
    July 2014.  The Appellant had appealed  on  the  basis  that  the  bank
    letter was not false, and the Respondent had not discharged the  burden
    of proof, and that the Respondent's decision breached  his  family  and
    private life rights under Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention  on
    Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).  The judge found that the Appellant
    had failed to discharge the burden to show that the bank statement  was
    not a false document, and while it was noted that a second bank  letter
    had been submitted, even if that was  authentic  and  proved  that  the
    necessary funds were available, the Appellant must show that he did not
    provide a false document in the first place.

 7. The judge therefore dismissed the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules,
    and the appeal was also dismissed in relation to Article 8,  the  judge
    noting that the Appellant had only ever had limited leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom, and had no expectation of anything more  permanent.



 8. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,
    there was no challenge to the Article 8 finding but  it  was  contended
    that the judge had erred in finding that the burden of proof was on the
    Appellant, whereas the burden in  this  case  was  on  the  Respondent,
    because the Respondent was alleging that  a  false  document  had  been
    submitted.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  McGeachy  who
    found it arguable that the judge had erred in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the
    determination,  in  stating  that  the  burden  of  proof  was  on  the
    Appellant, when the burden is on the Respondent to show that  the  bank
    letter was not genuine.

10. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending that the First-tier Tribunal decision did not  disclose
    a material error of law.  The Respondent had provided  strong  evidence
    that the document was not genuine, and it was then for the Appellant to
    deal with that evidence and the Appellant had failed to do so.

11. Directions were issued that there should be a hearing before the  Upper
    Tribunal to ascertain whether the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law.



The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Error of Law

12. I heard  submissions  from  Mr  Gondal  who  relied  upon  the  grounds
    contained  within  the  application  for  permission  to   appeal,   in
    contending that the judge had erred by finding that the burden of proof
    was on the Appellant and not the Respondent.  Mr Gondal submitted  that
    the Document Verification Report relied  upon  by  the  Respondent  and
    presented to the judge, was inconclusive and did  not  prove  that  the
    document was false.

13. Mr Bramble relied upon the rule 24 response and  pointed  out  that  in
    paragraph 3 of the determination the judge had correctly set  out  that
    in cases of deception the burden of proof is on the  party  making  the
    allegation.  Mr  Bramble  accepted  the  burden  was  in  fact  on  the
    Respondent, but submitted that the Appellant had a duty  to  rebut  the
    evidence put forward by the Respondent, and on that basis the judge had
    not erred in paragraph 6 by finding that "the Appellant has  failed  to
    discharge the burden which has now fallen on him to show that the first
    was not a false document".

14. Having considered the competing submissions I found that the judge  had
    erred in law.  The judge had correctly set out the burden of  proof  in
    paragraph 3, and in paragraph 5 had stated that  the  onus  was  on  an
    Appellant in immigration appeals to  prove  his  or  her  case  on  the
    balance of probability.  That is generally true,  but  not  in  a  case
    where the Respondent alleges deception, as it  is  the  Respondent  who
    bears  the  burden  of  proof  in  such  a  case,  on  a   balance   of
    probabilities.

15. The judge erred in paragraph 6 in  recording  that  the  Appellant  had
    failed to show  that  the  first  letter  he  had  submitted  with  his
    application was not a false document,  and  that  even  if  the  second
    letter was genuine, the Appellant must  still  show  that  he  did  not
    provide a false document in the first place.

16. I do not accept that the Appellant has such a burden, and in my view it
    is clear that the burden is on the Respondent to prove the falsity of a
    document  to  the  appropriate  standard,  which  is   a   balance   of
    probability.

17. Because the judge had erred in finding  that  the  burden  was  on  the
    Appellant,  I  concluded  that  his  findings  were  unsafe   and   the
    determination disclosed a material error of law  which  meant  that  it
    must be set aside.

18. Having  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  both
    representatives indicated that they were ready to proceed so  that  the
    decision could be remade.

Remaking the Decision

19. I ascertained that I had  all  documentation  upon  which  the  parties
    intended to rely, and that each party had served  the  other  with  any
    documents upon which reliance was to be placed.  I  had  the  documents
    that were  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  comprised  of  the
    Respondent's bundle with Annexes A-H, and the Appellant's  bundle  that
    had been before the First-tier Tribunal which comprised four pages.  In
    addition I had a letter from the Appellant's representatives dated  5th
    January 2015 enclosing a statement dated 23rd  December  2014  made  by
    Tanveer Ahmad who was providing the third  party  support,  a  Standard
    Chartered letter dated 8th December 2014, and a  letter  from  a  legal
    representative in Pakistan dated  24th  December  2014  confirming  the
    authenticity of Tanveer Ahmad's statement dated 24th December 2014, and
    the Standard Chartered letter dated 8th December 2014.

20. As these documents had not been before the First-tier Tribunal,  I  had
    to decide whether they should be admitted  into  evidence  pursuant  to
    rule 15(2A) of the 2008 Procedure  Rules.   Mr  Gondal  explained  that
    evidence had been submitted to prove that the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    was wrong to find that the bank letter was false.

21. I indicated that I would consider the evidence, but offered Mr  Bramble
    the opportunity to apply for an adjournment to verify the  contents  of
    the Standard Chartered letter dated 8th December 2014 which appeared to
    verify the authenticity of an earlier Standard  Chartered  letter.   Mr
    Bramble indicated that he  did  not  require  an  adjournment  and  was
    content to proceed.

22. I established that both parties had a copy of the Document Verification
    Report (DVR) dated 6th March 2014, and the e-mails attached thereto.

23. Mr Gondal indicated that although the Appellant was present, he did not
    intend  to  call  evidence  but  was  content  to  proceed  by  way  of
    submissions.

The Appellant's Submissions

24. Mr Gondal submitted that the bank letter  submitted  by  the  Appellant
    with his application was genuine and that the DVR did not state that it
    was not genuine but was inconclusive.  Mr  Gondal  submitted  that  the
    letters issued by Standard  Chartered  dated  21st  May  2014  and  8th
    December 2014 proved the authenticity of the letter submitted with  the
    application, which Mr Gondal advised was the Standard Chartered  letter
    contained at C1 of the Respondent's bundle.   This  is  a  letter  with
    reference number mw/009-n  confirming  that  8,000,000.00  rupees  were
    available to the Appellant, in an account held by  Tanveer  Ahmad,  his
    cousin.  This amount was said to  equal  ï¿½50,909.70  according  to  the
    Oanda exchange rate on 22nd January 2013.

25. Mr Gondal submitted that the Respondent had not attempted to verify the
    contents of the Standard Chartered letter dated  21st  May  2014  which
    confirmed the authenticity of the earlier letter.

26. In relation to Article 8 the  claim  was  based  upon  the  Appellant's
    private life in the United Kingdom.  It was accepted that  he  did  not
    satisfy the requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration  Rules.



The Respondent's Submissions

27. Mr Bramble relied upon the refusal decision dated 4th April  2014.   He
    agreed that the letter in question was the bank letter  at  C1  of  the
    Respondent's bundle, and submitted that the DVR was  not  inconclusive,
    but verified that letter to be false on the basis of an e-mail received
    from Standard Chartered Bank dated 6th March 2014 which was attached to
    the DVR.

28. Mr Bramble submitted that the letters from the bank dated 24th May 2014
    and 8th December 2014 were noticeably different in format to the letter
    that had been submitted with the  application.   Mr  Bramble  contended
    that the DVR satisfied the burden upon the Respondent, and proved  that
    the letter submitted with the application was false.  I  was  asked  to
    find that the subsequent letters from the bank addressed the  issue  of
    the amount of money in Tanveer Ahmad's account, but not the genuineness
    of the initial bank letter.

29. In relation to Article 8, Mr Bramble pointed  out  that  there  was  no
    evidence provided by the Appellant as to the extent of his private life
    in the United Kingdom and the appeal should be dismissed both under the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

The Appellant's Response

30. Mr Gondal pointed to the letter dated 8th December 2014 which explained
    why the format of the bank letters had changed, and also explained that
    the bank manager had changed.

31. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

32. Where an allegation is made by the Respondent, that  a  false  document
    has been submitted with an application, the burden of proof is  on  the
    Respondent to prove this on a balance of probability.  A mere assertion
    will not suffice, and evidence must be provided to discharge the burden
    of proof.

33. The Respondent's refusal letter does not detail why  it  was  contended
    that the letter is false and does not refer to  the  letter  by  either
    reference  or  date,  but  refers  to  the  Standard  Chartered  letter
    submitted with the application.  Both representatives agree  that  this
    letter must be the letter at C1 of the  Respondent's  bundle  with  the
    reference mw/009-n.  There is reference in the letter, in brackets,  to
    the date 27-09-2013 which must be an error, as it appears common ground
    that this letter was in fact submitted with  the  application  on  22nd
    January 2013.

34. Because there was no account number  on  this  letter,  the  Respondent
    wrote to the Appellant's representatives by letter dated 18th  February
    2014 (E1 in the Respondent's bundle) requesting the account number.

35. The representatives  responded  by  letter  dated  22nd  February  2014
    providing the account number,  and  providing  a  further  letter  from
    Standard Chartered dated 9th January 2013, with reference number mw/007-
    n.  This confirmed the account number of the third party Mr Ahmad.

36.  The  document  verification  request  was  made  to  the  T1  overseas
    verification team.  I do not accept Mr Gondal's submission that the DVR
    results were inconclusive.  The verification  results  state  that  the
    document was verified as false.  Attached to the DVR were some  e-mails
    from Standard Chartered Bank in Pakistan.  The e-mail sent on 6th March
    2014 referred to the attached document as not being genuine  and  being
    fake, as there was no branch manager  by  the  name  mentioned  in  the
    document.

37. The Appellant produced before the First-tier Tribunal a further  letter
    from Standard Chartered Bank dated 21st May 2014.  This confirmed  that
    Tanveer Ahmad held an account with that bank and had done so since 30th
    May 2009.  The account number was  confirmed  and  the  amount  in  the
    account,  as  stated  in  the  initial  letter   submitted   with   the
    application.

38. This letter referred to  three  previous  letters  sent  by  the  bank,
    reference mw/009-n dated 9th January 2013, mw/007-n dated  9th  January
    2013, and mw/009-n dated 27th September 2013.   The  letter  does  not
    however specifically confirm the authenticity of those letters, and  in
    any event the Tribunal file, and all  the  documentation  submitted  by
    both parties, only contain two letters.  I can find no trace of mw-009-
    n dated 9th January 2013.  The two previous letters  submitted  by  the
    Appellant were the initial letter with the application which has a date
    of 27th September 2013 and a reference of  mw/009-n,  and  one  letter
    dated 9th January 2013 with reference mw/007-n which was  submitted  by
    the Appellant's representatives on 21st February 2014 to answer a query
    made by the Respondent in relation to the previous letter.

39. It is apparent that the  Respondent  did  not  carry  out  any  further
    verification checks following the bank letter dated 21st May 2014.

40. The final letter from Standard Chartered Bank dated 8th  December  2014
    does refer to the previous letters submitted, although again there  are
    references to the same three letters referred to in  the  letter  dated
    21st May 2014 whereas I have only had sight of two  of  those  letters.
    The previous letters are confirmed as "true and genuine", although  the
    initial letter submitted with the Appellant's application  is  referred
    to as being dated 27th January 2013 rather than  27th  September  2013.
    However the reference is the same, and the date in that letter of  27th
    September 2013 must be an error.

41. The latest letter from Standard Chartered explains that the  letterhead
    format of the bank was changed, and that the branch  manager  named  in
    the initial letter was transferred from the Wapda Town Branch.

42. I have therefore been provided with more information  than  was  before
    the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I  now  have  specific  confirmation  from
    Standard Chartered, that the previous letters  were  genuine,  together
    with an explanation relating to the format of  those  letters  and  the
    fact that a branch manager was  transferred.   The  reasons  given  for
    finding the initial letter to be false, was that there  was  no  branch
    manager by that name.  Mr Bramble did not seek an adjournment to verify
    the contents of the Standard Chartered letter dated 8th December  2014.



43. I have carefully considered all the evidence placed before me,  bearing
    in  mind  that  severe  consequences  can  follow  from  a  finding  of
    deception.  I have placed weight upon  the  Standard  Chartered  letter
    dated 8th December 2014, which provides an explanation for the  earlier
    finding that there was no branch manager of that name,  and  which  has
    not been challenged.

44. Because of the weight I have placed upon this letter, I  conclude  that
    the Respondent has not discharged the burden of proof and therefore the
    application should not be dismissed by reason of paragraph  322(1A)  of
    the Immigration Rules, and the appeal is allowed under the  Immigration
    Rules.  It  is  now  a  matter  for  the  Respondent  to  consider  the
    application further in relation to paragraph 245DD(h) as  indicated  in
    the refusal decision dated 4th April 2014.

45. As to Article 8, my primary finding is that this was not before  me  as
    there was no challenge to the findings made by the First-tier  Tribunal
    in relation to Article 8, and therefore permission to  appeal  was  not
    granted on that issue.

46. If I am wrong on that, and Article 8 was before me, it was  pursued  in
    the alternative, and as I have allowed the appeal under the Immigration
    Rules, there is no need to go on  and  make  findings  in  relation  to
    Article 8.

Notice of Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.  The appeal is allowed  under
the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As the appeal is allowed I have considered whether  to  make  a  fee  award.
The evidence which has caused me to  allow  this  appeal  was  not  produced
before the decision maker, and therefore I make no fee award.
