For the Respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This are appeals against the decisions of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal B A Morris who, in a decision dated 24 July 2015,  dismissed
       the various appeals brought against the decisions of  the  respondent
       dated  25  September  2014  refusing  the  appellants'  human  rights
       applications for leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

Relevant Background

    2. The appellants are nationals of Ghana. The 1st  appellant's  date  of
       birth  is  21  July  1973.  His  wife,  who  is  identified  in   the
       determination as the third appellant, was born on  5  May  1979.  The
       couple have three children, the second, fourth and  fifth  appellants
       and they were born in February 2006, February 2010 and February 2007.
       At the date of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal they were 5
       years old, 8 years old and 9ï¿½ years old.

    3. The 1st appellant claims that he entered the United Kingdom on 26 May
       2001.  There was no evidence of his entry. In any event, he  remained
       unlawfully thereafter. The 3rd appellant entered the  United  Kingdom
       in 2003 and she remained in the country unlawfully. The 1st  and  3rd
       appellants began a relationship and the three children were born  out
       of this relationship. It is not in dispute  that  the  children  have
       remained in the United Kingdom all their lives and have always  lived
       with their parents.

    4. The respondent's decision of 24 September 2014 considered and refused
       applications made  by  the  appellants  for  leave  to  remain  under
       Appendix FM, paragraph 276ADE and on an exceptional basis outside  of
       the Immigration Rules and Article 8.

    5. In the appeal before the First-tier the appellants were  represented,
       as they are today, by Mr Collins of Counsel.  He provided a  skeleton
       argument to the First-tier Tribunal and there was a bundle running to
       some 152 pages. Mr Collins called no oral evidence  and  the  hearing
       proceeded by way of submissions.

    6.  The  thrust  of  Mr  Collins's  submissions  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, as recorded at paragraph 7 of the decision, was that it was
       unreasonable for the two eldest children to leave the United  Kingdom
       bearing in mind their length of residence and their ages. Mr  Collins
       referred  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  various   school   documents
       demonstrating, according to the First-tier judge, that  the  children
       were doing well.  Mr Collins referred to  the  case  of  Azimi-Moayed
       [2013] UKUT 00197. He submitted that the children only spoke English.
       They knew nothing of Ghana and knew only the United Kingdom.

    7. The judge's reasoning is contained in her decision between paragraphs
       12 and 14.  At paragraph 12 the judge made the observation  that  the
       children were well cared for by their parents. The judge  found  that
       there was no evidence that the children were suffering from any  ill-
       health, although there was some evidence that  the  fourth  appellant
       had been diagnosed with what was referred to  as  an  innocent  heart
       murmur in September 2014. The judge noted the absence of any evidence
       that  the  parents  could  not  or  would  not  continue  to  provide
       appropriate care to each child whether it be in the United Kingdom or
       Ghana. There was no evidence before the  First-tier  Judge  that  the
       children were not aware of their Ghanaian culture and, at the end  of
       paragraph 12, the judge found that it was in the  best  interests  of
       each child that they  should  continue  to  be  cared  for  by  their
       parents, be that in Ghana or in the United Kingdom. At  paragraph  13
       the judge noted that the oldest children had  lived  continuously  in
       the United Kingdom for at least seven years and correctly  identified
       that the issue  to  be  decided  was  whether  or  not  it  would  be
       unreasonable to expect them to leave the United Kingdom.

    8. At paragraph 14 the judge made reference once again  to  the  nursery
       and school reports and concluded that the children were  making  good
       progress and that they had engaged with their peer group.  The  judge
       stated:
           "There was no evidence before me to  show  that  these  children
           would not integrate into the Ghanaian education system with  the
           help and support of their parents. There was  also  no  evidence
           before me to show that these children would not  integrate  into
           Ghanaian society with the help and support of their parents."

    9. The judge noted the assertion that the children  only  spoke  English
       but found, given that the first appellant had used the services of  a
       Twi interpreter, that the parents would be able to provide  help  and
       support to the children to enable them to learn the language  of  the
       country  of  which  they  were  nationals.  The  judge   specifically
       indicated that she had taken into account the  case  of  Azimi-Moayed
       which, amongst other things, noted that seven years  residence  in  a
       country from the age of 4 was likely to  be  more  significant  to  a
       child than the first seven years  of  his  or  her  life.  The  judge
       consequently dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Appeal

   10. The grounds, also settled by Mr Collins, indicated  that,  given  the
       ages of the children, and in  particular  the  oldest  two  children,
       their length of residence in the United Kingdom  and  the  supporting
       documentation relating  to  their  education  and  their  social  and
       cultural ties, it was manifestly unreasonable to expect them to leave
       the United Kingdom and that the judge had acted  unreasonably  in  so
       concluding.  At paragraphs 9 to  11  the  grounds  contend  that  the
       judge's conclusions were effectively bereft  of  adequate  reasoning.
       The grounds  maintain  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed
       adequately to engage with or to consider the effect of uprooting  the
       children from a settled life in the United Kingdom and removing  them
       to a country with which they were entirely  unfamiliar  and  did  not
       even know the language. I pause at this point to take judicial notice
       of the fact that English is the official language of Ghana and is  in
       fact the linga franca in Ghana. It was also  argued  that  the  judge
       failed to adequately apply Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and
       Immigration Act 2009 and the principles enunciated  in  the  case  of
       Azimi-Moayed.

   11. Mr Collins, in admirably brief  and  focused  submissions,  indicated
       that the principal issue before the judge was the effect of uprooting
       the  children  and,  to  this  extent,  the  determination  did   not
       adequately take into account their various ties including  education,
       cultural and social ties. It was submitted that if one had regard  to
       the educational reports these were sufficient to show, albeit  in  an
       indirect manner, the negative impact on the children.

Discussion

   12. The essential heart of the challenge to the lawfulness of the  First-
       tier Tribunal decision is that the judge was not lawfully entitled to
       conclude that it was reasonable for the two eldest children, who  had
       lived in the United Kingdom in excess of seven years, to be  expected
       to relocate having regard to their personal circumstances. It is said
       that the judge failed to provide adequate reasoning or failed to take
       into account relevant circumstances or apply relevant authority,  and
       so reach a decision that was irrational. I remind myself of the scope
       for intervention of an Appellate Tribunal in cases of this  kind.  It
       has not been suggested that the  judge  failed  to  ask  herself  the
       correct question. One can see from paragraph 13 of the  determination
       that  the  judge  had  well  in  mind  the  principal  issue  in  the
       proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal
       i.e. the reasonableness of the children having to  leave  the  United
       Kingdom.

   13. The test for perversity or  irrationality  is  whether  the  decision
       under appeal is one which no person  acting  judicially  or  properly
       instructed  on  the  relevant  law  could  reasonably  have  made.  I
       additionally remind myself that decisions in human rights  cases  are
       about the outcome rather than the anterior  decision-making  process.
       It is argued that the judge had not made  adequate  findings  on  the
       impact of the removal. But there was little probative evidence of the
       impact of the removal on the children before the First-tier Tribunal.
       The grounds do not identify any particularised impact or  consequence
       on  the  children  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  failed  to
       consider, or in respect of which she failed to  refer.  The  skeleton
       argument that was before the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  was,  with
       respect, equally bare. None of the statements that  were  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal judge described the impact on the children  other
       than to assert that removal would amount  to  a  great  interruption.
       There was I find, a fatal lack  of  particularisation  or  detail  in
       respect of the  impact  that  removal  would  actually  have  on  the
       children. Nor was any oral evidence called at the hearing. There  was
       therefore very limited information before the judge to enable her  to
       consider the impact and consequences of removal. There  were  letters
       of support contained in the appellant's bundle from, inter alia,  GF,
       who was the children's uncle, from a JN and from PF, CF and  RF,  and
       from other friends, but none of those spoke  of  the  impact  on  the
       children of removal.

   14. The evidence of  education  consisted  of  awards,  certificates  and
       school reports, and Mr Collins drew my attention today to the  school
       reports. The First-tier Tribunal Judge did  take  into  account  this
       evidence. This is clear from paragraph 14 of the decision. The  judge
       also took into account the relevant medical evidence relating to  the
       fourth appellant.  In any event, the judge was fully entitled to find
       that  the  appellants  would  be  able  to  ease   their   children's
       integration into Ghanaian society. The judge made a decision  on  the
       basis of the evidence that was presented to her. She  was  rationally
       entitled to her conclusion. The judge clearly stated  that  she  took
       account of the best interests of the children under Section 55 of the
       Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and this is clear  from
       paragraph 9 of the decision. At the end of  paragraph  12  the  judge
       found that the best interests of the children  were  to  remain  with
       their parents. In so doing, the  judge  also  correctly  applied  the
       principles  enunciated  in  Azimi-Moayed,  contrary  to  the  settled
       grounds. The first head note of Azimi-Moayed reads,  "As  a  starting
       point it is in the best interests of children to be with  both  their
       parents and if both parents are being removed from the United Kingdom
       then the starting point suggests that so  should  dependent  children
       who form part of their household unless  there  are  reasons  to  the
       contrary." The judge was entitled to find that this applied  squarely
       to the appellants. Headnote (iv) of the same case  indicates,  "Apart
       from the terms of published policies and rules,  the  Tribunal  notes
       that seven years from age four is likely to be more significant to  a
       child that the first seven years of life." The  two  oldest  children
       had not lived in the United Kingdom for 7 years from the age of 4.

  15.    In the absence of any particularised or cogent evidence describing
       the adverse impact on the children of  their  proposed  removal,  and
       given the support  that  the  children's  parents  would  undoubtedly
       provide to them, I am satisfied that the decision was  one  that  the
       First-tier Tribunal was reasonably entitled to reach and that  it  is
       not infected by any material error of law.

Notice of Decision

  16.    The appeals are dismissed

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any  member  of  their  family.  This  direction
applies both to the appellants and to  the  respondent.  Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
