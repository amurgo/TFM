For the Appellant:     Mr Ball, Counsel, instructed by Hersi & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the resumed hearing of the  appeals  of  the  first  to  fourth
    Appellants, nationals of Somalia, who appeal against  the  decision  of
    the Respondent dated 15 April 2013 to refuse them  entry  clearance  to
    enter the UK as the dependants of Mr Abdi [A], a British citizen.

2.   The history of this appeal is set out  in  my  error  of  law  decision
    dated 27 June 2016 following an error of law hearing on 25 May 2016  at
    Field House.  I do not intend to repeat that immigration history in the
    present decision. The error of law decision should  be  read  alongside
    the present decision.

3.   At the end of the hearing on 25 May I set aside a decision of Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Aujla dated 3 August 2015 on the  grounds  that
    it contained material errors of law.  The Tribunal was unable on 25 May
    2016 to continue to rehear the Appellants' appeals for  lack  of  court
    time and so that further evidence could be adduced  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants.  I have today heard evidence from Mr [A], the  Sponsor  and
    husband of the first Appellant and  father  of  the  second  to  fourth
    Appellants.

4.   The issues in this appeal were narrowed at the outset  of  the  hearing
    today.  Mr Ball appearing for the Appellants confirmed that it was  the
    case that the Appellants  were  unable  to  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM  of the Immigration  Rules  because  they  were  unable  to
    satisfy the evidential requirements  set  out  in  Appendix  FM-SE,  in
    particular in relation to the financial  documentation  supporting  the
    proposition that the Sponsor had an  annual  income  of  �27,200,  that
    being the required amount for this particular family.

5.   Further, the Sponsor did  not  submit  with  the  application  relevant
    letters from his three different employers as would be  required  under
    Appendix FM-SE.  Although Mr Ball later made submissions to me that the
    Sponsor was at the date of decision in any event earning in  excess  of
    the �27,200 mark,  he  accepted  that  that  submission  would  not  be
    relevant for the pursues of satisfying the Immigration Rule but  rather
    was  a   relevant   consideration   in   the   determination   of   the
    proportionality under Article 8 ECHR of the Respondent's decisions.

6.   I  heard  oral  evidence  from  the  Sponsor.   He  adopted  a  witness
    statement dated 19 May 2014 contained  within  the  Appellants'  bundle
    which was helpfully resubmitted for the purposes of  this  hearing.   I
    should record that although the Respondent's  original  decisions  took
    issue with whether the Appellant and the Sponsor were legally  married,
    that issue was satisfactorily resolved  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Aujla and although his decision was set aside that finding of fact  and
    the fact that the second to fourth Appellants are the children  of  the
    Sponsor have been  retained for the purposes of this rehearing.

7.   The Sponsor's witness statement describes that he himself was  born  on
    20 December 1986 in Mogadishu, Somalia.  His wife, the first Appellant,
    was also born in Mogadishu.   Both  are  said  to  be  members  of  the
    minority Ashraf clan.  It became apparent  during  the  Sponsor's  oral
    evidence that notwithstanding that they were both born  Ashraf  and  in
    Mogadishu, there is a clan difference  between  them.   He  is  of  the
    Ashraf Hussain sub clan and the first Appellant of  the  Ashraf  Hassan
    sub clan.

8.   The former, the Sponsor says, is traditionally resident  in  the  south
    of Somalia whereas the latter clan, his wife's clan, was  traditionally
    resident in the  north  of  Somalia,  now  known  as  Somaliland.   The
    relevance of that becomes apparent in due  course.   The  Sponsor  gave
    evidence that in 1995 during the civil war his household  in  Mogadishu
    was attacked by militiamen. Two uncles and his mother were  killed  and
    he was required to flee Somalia to Ethiopia.

9.   The Sponsor's witness statement states that he and his wife married  on
    5 April 2003 in Las-anod, Somalia. He clarified in oral  evidence  that
    this is in fact in Somaliland. It  is  in  the  northern  part  of  the
    country, about 200 miles north of the border of Somalia and Somaliland.
    The Sponsor explains in oral evidence that he and the remaining members
    of his family had initially been refugees in Ethiopia in the Dire  Dawa
    area in a refugee camp.  In  around  1997  the  Sponsor  and  remaining
    members of his family went to live in Addis Ababa.  It was  there  that
    he met his wife who herself had fled with family members from  Somalia.
    The Sponsor was still a minor at that time.

10.  In around 2001 the Sponsor's  oldest  sister  had  the  opportunity  of
    travelling to the United Kingdom.  She was there later recognised as  a
    refugee.

11.  In around 2002 the Sponsor and first Appellant returned  to  Somaliland
    because of the Sponsor's older sister leaving Ethiopia to come  to  the
    UK.  An uncle of the first Appellant suggested to the  first  Appellant
    and Sponsor that they travel with him from Ethiopia to live in Las-anod
    in Somaliland and they did so.

12.  On 5 April 2003 the first Appellant and Sponsor married  Las-anod.  The
    couple's first child was born  on  2  April  2004  in  Somaliland.  The
    Sponsor became 18 on 20 December 2004. Their second child was  born  on
    30 April 2005, again in Somaliland.

13.  However, prior to the Sponsor becoming  an  adult  an  application  was
    made for him to travel to the United Kingdom on the  basis  of  refugee
    family reunion with his older sister.  This application was refused and
    litigated for a protracted period,  apparently  succeeding  after  four
    years. It was therefore on 28 August 2006 that the Sponsor  arrived  in
    the UK aged 19 as a dependant of his sister.

14.   The  Sponsor  continued  in  his  evidence  to  explain   his   wife's
    circumstances after he left Somaliland.   It  is  said  that  there  is
    discrimination in Somaliland against persons perceived to be  from  the
    south i.e. Somalia.  Although the first Appellant and the Sponsor  were
    both born in Mogadishu, the discrimination was principally aimed at the
    Sponsor because his clan origins were  from  the  south,  as  explained
    above.

15.  The Sponsor said that his wife and  children  faced  discrimination  in
    Somaliland due to their association and connection with him.  There was
    discrimination and there was  a  passing  reference  to  someone  being
    beaten, where the Sponsor's evidence was not  entirely  clear  on  that
    particular point.  After the Sponsor had been in the United Kingdom for
    some time he obtained a travel document and wished to visit his family.
     This was arranged to take place  in  Ethiopia,  possibly  because  the
    Sponsor's travel document precluded him from travelling to  Somalia  or
    Somaliland.  This took place in July 2009.

16.  The Sponsor gave evidence that the first Appellant  obtained  a  Somali
    passport for herself in around February 2009 and travelled lawfully  to
    Ethiopia, entering as a visitor in around May or June 2009.  During the
    Sponsor's visit there the fourth Appellant was conceived.  The  Sponsor
    later returned to the UK and the first Appellant and two children  were
    deported from Ethiopia to Somaliland.  The account was that  they  were
    rounded up with other Somalis in Ethiopia, put in a  police  truck  and
    taken to the land border and left.

17.  The Sponsor thought that the first Appellant's visa to  visit  Ethiopia
    was only valid for two months. Clearly we do not have the full  reasons
    behind that deportation.

18.  The first Appellant continued living in Las-anod Somaliland  from  2009
    until February 2013.  By this time the  Sponsor  had  obtained  British
    citizenship and was now earning sufficient, he thought, to  support  an
    application for entry clearance for his family members.  The  Sponsor's
    evidence was that the reason for the Appellants travelling to  Ethiopia
    in February 2013 was for the purposes  of  making  an  application  for
    entry clearance.

19.  The first Appellant's Somalia passport had by  this  time  expired  and
    the Sponsor asserted in oral evidence  that  the  first  Appellant  was
    unable to obtain a replacement Somali  passport,  the  passport  system
    having  changed  in   the   meantime   and   a   different   government
    administration being in place.    The  Appellants  therefore  travelled
    unlawfully from Somaliland to Ethiopia in 2013, making the journey in a
    lorry.   This was said to be a difficult journey for them all.

20.  The application for entry clearance was made. The decision refusing  it
    was dated 15 April 2013.

21.  The Appellants have remained in  Ethiopia  since  that  time.   I  have
    heard evidence as to their continuing circumstances in  Ethiopia  which
    are that they are financially supported by the Sponsor.  They do not go
    out much for fear of being  picked  up  by  Ethiopian  authorities  and
    removed back to Somaliland and the children are  not  in  education  in
    Ethiopia.  This was said to be because of lack  of  security  and  that
    even to obtain private tuition it was necessary  to  possess  Ethiopian
    ID, which the Appellants lack.

22.  The Sponsor said that  the  Appellants  were  unwilling  to  return  to
    Somaliland despite their adverse circumstances in Ethiopia because they
    feared being unable to re-enter Ethiopia should the need require in the
    event of entry clearance being granted.  They also did not wish to make
    the arduous  journey  again  and  they  felt  unwelcome  by  people  in
    Somaliland due to their association with the Sponsor.

23.  I heard submissions from the parties which are recorded  in  my  record
    of proceedings and which I refer to below as necessary.

24.  Mr Avery relied upon the original refusal letter  although  the  issues
    raised in that document are now  largely  superceded  by  the  retained
    findings of the judge regarding the genuineness  and  legality  of  the
    relationship between the Appellant and the Sponsor. Mr Avery  submitted
    that the Appellants do not meet the Immigration Rules and that  was  an
    important  relevant  consideration  in  any  proportionality  balancing
    exercise. see also s.117B(1) NIAA 2002.  He submitted  that  there  was
    inadequate evidence to demonstrate that  the  family  could  not  enjoy
    family life together outside of the United Kingdom, whether in Ethiopia
    or in Somaliland.  He suggested  that  I  give  little  weight  to  the
    description of discrimination against the family in  Somaliland,  given
    the late provision of that evidence.

25.  Mr Avery also suggested that there was an obvious option  open  to  the
    Appellants rather than seeking to  argue  that  there  were  compelling
    circumstances in their appeals which was to make  a  fresh  application
    for entry clearance, it being the Sponsor's case that he would  now  be
    able to demonstrate a level of income  above  the  required  level  and
    would be able to provide the relevant specified evidence in support  of
    that.  Mr Avery saw no justified reason why the Appellants  should  not
    make a fresh application and there were no compelling circumstances  in
    the appeals.

26.  Mr Ball on behalf of the  Appellants  addressing  the  five  stages  in
    Razgar asserted that there clearly was family life existing as  between
    the Sponsor and the Appellants.  The Sponsor was the biological  father
    of the children and it had now been accepted that he is the  spouse  of
    the first Appellant.   Mr  Ball  asserted  that  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent amounted to an interference with the enjoyment of the family
    lives of this family.

27.  There was a legitimate reason why the Sponsor had left  Somaliland  for
    the UK in 2006. He had legitimately been  pursuing  an  application  to
    become a dependant of his older sister when he was still a minor child.
     That application took a long time to be  resolved.   He  had  by  then
    married and had two children.  The subsequent refusal by the Respondent
    of entry clearance to the Appellants represented an  interference  with
    the family lives of the whole family.  The remaining  steps  in  Razgar
    required no specific consideration other than step  five;  whether  the
    decision was proportionate.

28.  Any suggestion that the Sponsor should  leave  the  United  Kingdom  to
    join the Appellants in either Ethiopia or Somaliland  was  unreasonable
    given that neither the Sponsor nor the Appellants had any legal  status
    in Ethiopia.  Their situation there would be  entirely  precarious  and
    they would all be at risk of removal to Somaliland.

29.  Although  the  Sponsor  himself  asserted  that  there  were  different
    administrations in place between Somalia and Somaliland, there  was  no
    country information before the Tribunal  on  that  issue  and  Mr  Ball
    accepted that he could not advance  the  proposition  to  me  that  the
    Sponsor would not be admissible to Somaliland.  However he did seek  to
    rely upon the Sponsor's oral evidence as  to  discrimination  that  the
    Sponsor said would exist against him and  his  children  due  to  their
    ethnic and clan origins.

30.  Mr Ball also argued that it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    Sponsor to leave the United Kingdom because as a national of the United
    Kingdom he was thereby an EU national and  could  not  be  expected  to
    leave the European Union, referring to the case  of  Sanade.   Further,
    the Sponsor had developed a significant private and family life here in
    the United Kingdom.  He had given evidence that he had two brothers and
    two sisters in the UK and he clearly has  three  different  jobs  which
    support him and his family.

31.  Mr Ball asked me to place little weight on the fact  that  the  Sponsor
    had seemingly voluntarily left Ethiopia in around 2001 or 2002 to  live
    in Somaliland, but he  was  still  a  minor  child  at  that  time  and
    effectively under the protection of a neighbour  who  was  moving  from
    Ethiopia to Somaliland at that time - this transpired to be  the  first
    Appellant's uncle.

32.  Mr  Ball  addressed  me  on  the  considerations  in  Part  5A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   This  was  not  a  case
    where it could be said that family life had  been  established  in  the
    United Kingdom in precarious  circumstances,  rather  the  family  life
    concerned had been formed in genuine circumstances outside of  the  UK.
    The Sponsor had a good reason for travelling to the United Kingdom  and
    the Appellants a good reason for seeking to join him here.  The  family
    would be financially independent, he said.  There  was  no  requirement
    for this particular Appellant to demonstrate that  they  spoke  English
    because being Somali nationals it was  said  that  they  are  generally
    excused the requirement in an application under Appendix FM  to provide
    an English language certificate due to shortages of  relevant  training
    and testing centres in Somalia.

33.  In closing Mr Ball invited me to consider the welfare of  the  children
    in this matter, that being the principal reason why I had decided  that
    there had been an error of law by the First-tier Judge for  not  having
    considered that matter in sufficient detail.  Mr Ball argued  that  the
    children were continuing  to  suffer  by  being  out  of  education  in
    Ethiopia. I reminded him that the date which  I  must  consider  is  15
    April 2013, some time ago,  and  I  cannot  take  into  account  recent
    circumstances.  However he invited me to  conclude  that  the  children
    were not in education at that time, either  and  nor  could  they  then
    foreseeably be expected to enter into education given  the  explanation
    of the Sponsor.

34.  He argued that according to his schedule of  income  for  the  Sponsor,
    the Sponsor had demonstrated a relevant level of income notwithstanding
    the fact that income did not satisfy the requirements of  Appendix  FM-
    SE, and that no financial  burden  would  be  placed  upon  the  United
    Kingdom by the arrival of the Appellants. He  asserted  that  the  only
    argument available to the Respondent to suggest that  refusal of  entry
    clearance to these appellants was proportionate would  be  due  to  the
    economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom but this, Mr Ball argued,  was
    not a relevant consideration as they would be independent  financially.
    He invited me to allow the appeals.

     Discussion

35.  For the purposes of  determining  this  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and under Article 8 ECHR, I must take into account  circumstances
    appertaining at the date of the decision to refuse entry clearance.

36.  In the light of  the  fact  that  it  is  accepted  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants that the appeals cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules,
    I turn to consider the matter under Article 8  ECHR.   Given  that  the
    welfare of children is involved as a consideration in this case, I find
    that there are good grounds for considering the merits  of  the  appeal
    outside of the Immigration Rules under Article 8  ECHR.   The  relevant
    test to succeed in such an appeal against refusal of entry clearance is
    to consider whether there are  compelling  circumstances  justifying  a
    grant of entry clearance to the Appellants notwithstanding  their  non-
    satisfaction of the Immigration Rules - see eg SS (Congo) v SSHD [2015]
    EWCA Civ 387 para 40.

37.  I find that notwithstanding that this is an appeal against  refusal  of
    entry clearance, rather than against refusal to grant leave to  remain,
    and s.55 Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009  does  not  apply
    directly in this appeal, the best interests of the children are still a
    relevant consideration  in  performing  any  proportionality  balancing
    exercise - see my error  of  law  decision  paragraphs  23-24.  I  must
    determine the best interests of the children. I should  also  consider,
    as per SS (Congo) paras 36-37, the circumstances in which  family  life
    has come about. I shall also consider the application of Part  5A  NIAA
    2002.

38.  As to the factual background to the appeals, I retain the  findings  of
    the judge that the marriage of  the  first  Appellant  and  Sponsor  is
    legally valid and that the Sponsor is  the  father  of  the  second  to
    fourth Appellants. I accept Mr Ball's submission that there  is  family
    life  between   the   Appellants   and   the   Sponsor;   he   is   the
    husband/biological father respectively to the Appellants, is in contact
    with them, and maintains them financially.

39.  It is apparent that the Sponsor has provided  further  detail  in  oral
    evidence of the circumstances in which his relationship with the  first
    Appellant began, and their movements  between  Somalia,  Ethiopia,  and
    Somaliland.   I have no real reason to doubt that  evidence  (save  for
    the issue in paragraph 39 below). It was  largely  given  during  cross
    examination and during questions from me. It was a  stated  purpose  of
    this resumed hearing that such further  detail  should  be  given  (see
    error of law decision, paragraph 33).  His  evidence  was  given  in  a
    straightforward manner and it was apparent that he doing  his  best  to
    assist the Tribunal in answering the questions put to him.

40.  However, one element of that oral evidence is that the Sponsor and  his
    children (by association with him) faced discrimination  in  Somaliland
    as a result of his particular sub clan of the Ashraf clan. Not only was
    there no county information before me as to such discrimination, I find
    that such a specific issue, if it was to form part of  the  Appellants'
    reasons as  to  why  family  life  could  not  continue  in  Somali  or
    Somaliland,  should  have  been  mentioned  before.  I  find  that  the
    Appellants have not  made  out  to  a  balance  of  probabilities  that
    discrimination has or would take  place  against  the  Sponsor  or  the
    second to fourth Appellants in Somaliland.

41.  I  do  find  that  the  position  of  the  Appellants  in  Ethiopia  is
    precarious. Their journeys to Ethiopia in 2009 and again in  2013  were
    for understandable reasons, being, respectively, (i) to meet  with  the
    Sponsor, who was unable to enter Somalia/Somaliland,  and (ii) to  make
    an application for entry clearance; something not possible  in  Somalia
    itself. I accept that the Appellants were deported from Ethiopia to the
    border of Somalia in 2009; the evidence about that has been consistent.
     I accept the Sponsor's evidence that that the Appellants last  entered
    Ethiopia in 2013 without passports or permission  to  enter  and  their
    status is more precarious than it was at the time of their first  entry
    in 2009, which was made with passports and  with  permission  to  enter
    Ethiopia as visitors. I accept that both their deportation in 2009  and
    their  entry  to  Ethiopia  in  2013  were  arduous  experiences.   The
    Appellants' circumstances at  the  date  of  decision  were  that  they
    remained largely indoors, fearing round-ups and deportation of  illegal
    migrants in Ethiopia; they were in  receipt  of  remittances  from  the
    Sponsor and financially dependent on him, and the children were not  in
    education.

42.  There is no evidence before me that the Sponsor would  be  entitled  to
    enter Ethiopia on any basis other than as a temporary  visitor,  as  he
    did in 2009.  None  of  them  are  Ethiopian  nationals.  There  is  no
    evidence before me that the Appellants or the Sponsor would be entitled
    to reside lawfully in Ethiopia and enjoy their family life there on  an
    ongoing basis. The Appellants establish to a balance  of  probabilities
    that family life cannot continue in Ethiopia. In any  event,  requiring
    the Sponsor to live in Ethiopia in order to continue  his  family  life
    with the Appellants would result in his ceasing to have an income  from
    his  employment  in  the  United  Kingdom;   the   family's   financial
    circumstances would be wholly uncertain.

43.  I consider the best interests of the children. The assessment of  those
    interests is a  discreet  exercise  to  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise, but the outcome of the best interest assessment forms part of
    the ultimate proportionality assessment. See, ZH Tanzania  [2011]  UKSC
    4, paras 26 and 33:

         "33. We now have a much greater understanding of the importance  of
         these issues in assessing the overall well-being of the  child.  In
         making the proportionality assessment under  article  8,  the  best
         interests of the child must be a primary consideration. This  means
         that they must  be  considered  first.  They  can,  of  course,  be
         outweighed by the cumulative effect  of  other  considerations.  In
         this case, the  countervailing  considerations  were  the  need  to
         maintain firm  and  fair  immigration  control,  coupled  with  the
         mother's appalling immigration history and  the  precariousness  of
         her position when family life was created...."

44.  Absent some counterveilling consideration  such  as  criminality  or  a
    likely malign or negative influence by the Sponsor over the children, I
    find that it is in the best interests of the children for them to  live
    with both parents. Children are more likely to   thrive when  supported
    by both parents.  Further, it is not in the children's  best  interests
    to remain outside of education; their predicament at date of decision.

45.  I  consider  whether  family  life  could  be  enjoyed  in  Somalia  or
    Somaliland. I find that the means by which the Appellants could  return
    to Somali/Somaliland is uncertain, given their lack  of  Somali  travel
    documents. If the Sponsor left the United Kingdom to  live  in  Somalia
    with  the  Appellants,  he  would  necessarily  have  to  give  up  his
    employment and means of income. The family's financial circumstances in
    Somalia would be wholly uncertain. I take into account  the  fact  that
    although the Sponsor has not been recognised as a refugee from Somalia,
    he has given consistent  evidence  regarding  the  death  in  traumatic
    circumstances of his mother and two uncles in Somalia  when  he  was  a
    child.

46.  Further, the Sponsor has lived in the United Kingdom for 10  years  and
    is a British citizen. I find although the  Sponsor  left  Somalia,  his
    wife and his then two children in Somalia in 2006, the circumstances in
    which he did so are more akin to those described in paragraph 36 of  SS
    (Congo) v SSHD, referred to in the error of law decision.  The  Sponsor
    and first Appellant had formed a family life in ordinary and legitimate
    circumstances, not under any circumstances of precariousness  in  terms
    of UK immigration controls. There was an understandable reason for  the
    Sponsor  coming  to  the  United  Kingdom  in  2006;   the   successful
    culmination of an application  for  refugee  family  reunion  with  his
    sister, which commenced, potentially, even before his marriage  to  the
    first Appellant.

47.  I also  consider  the  reason  why  the  Appellants  do  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules. These relate  to  the  Sponsor's
    income; the evidence submitted with the application did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE. There  also  remains  an  issue  as  to
    whether the Sponsor's actual income,  taken  over  a  period  of  three
    months before the application, established  that  he  was  during  that
    period earning an average of over �27,200 per annum, pro rata. Although
    Mr Ball asserted in oral  submissions  that  that  was  the  case,  and
    provided a schedule of income,  cross  referenced  to  the  Appellant's
    bundle, in fact his hand-written amendments to that schedule show  that
    the Sponsor's average income, at �2,192 per month over that three month
    period, was in fact �34 per month short of the �2,226 per month  income
    that would be required to demonstrate an annual income  of  �27,200.  I
    take that shortfall into account.

48.  There is no near-miss principle when  assessing  minor  omissions  from
    satisfying the requirements of immigration rules. As per Patel & Ors  v
    SSHD [2013] UKSC 72, paras 54-56.  However I also refer  to  discussion
    of the 'near-miss' issue continued in SS (Congo) at paras 55-56:

         "55.  In  our  judgment,  the  true  position  lies  between  these
         submissions. Contrary to the argument of the respondents, that fact
         that an applicant may be able to say that their  case  is  a  'near
         miss' in relation to satisfying the requirements of the Rules  will
         by no means show that compelling circumstances exist requiring  the
         grant of LTE outside the Rules. A good deal more  than  this  would
         need to be shown to make out such a case. The respondents' argument
         fails to recognise the value to  be  attached  to  having  a  clear
         statement of the standards applicable to everyone and fails to give
         proper weight to  the  judgment  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  as
         expressed in the Rules, regarding what is needed to meet the public
         interest which is  in  issue.  The  'near  miss'  argument  of  the
         respondents  cannot  be   sustained   in   the   light   of   these
         considerations and the authority of Miah v Secretary of  State  for
         the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 261, especially at [21]-[26].


         56.  However, it cannot be said that the fact that a case  involves
         a 'near miss' in relation to the requirements set out in the  Rules
         is wholly irrelevant  to  the  balancing  exercise  required  under
         Article 8. If an applicant  can  show  that  there  are  individual
         interests at stake covered by Article 8 which give rise to a strong
         claim that compelling circumstances may exist to justify the  grant
         of LTE outside the Rules, the fact that their case is also a  'near
         miss' case may be a relevant consideration which tips  the  balance
         under Article 8 in their favour. In such a case, the applicant will
         be able to say that the detrimental impact on the  public  interest
         in issue if LTE is granted in their favour will  be  somewhat  less
         than in a case where the gap between the applicant's  position  and
         the requirements of the Rules is great, and the risk that they  may
         end up having recourse to public funds and resources  is  therefore
         greater."

49.  I find that the requirements for  entry  clearance  under  Appendix  FM
    relate to issues of kinship, family relationship and dependence (as per
    Patel, para 54). The Appellants  have  failed  to  meet  the  line  for
    entitlement to leave to enter drawn by those rules.   However,  I  find
    notwithstanding  the  Appellants'  failure  to  meet  the  rules,   the
    potential detrimental impact on the public interest by  granting  entry
    clearance to the Appellants, is less, by reason of the  fact  that  the
    Sponsor's income is only �34 per month less than the required income of
    �27,200 per annum, than in a case where the gap between the applicant's
    position and the requirements of the Rules is great. I find that  there
    is no significant risk that the Appellants may end up  having  recourse
    to public funds and resources.

50.  In conclusion, bearing in mind all my  findings  above,  including  the
    best  interests  of  the   children,   the   precarious   and   adverse
    circumstances in which the Appellants live in Ethiopia, the lack of any
    opportunity for family  life  to  continue  in  Ethiopia,  the  adverse
    circumstances in which family  life  might  be  continued  in  Somalia,
    including the requirement that  for  that  to  happen  the  Sponsor,  a
    British national, would have to  give  up  work  in  the  UK,  and  the
    family's financial circumstances in Somalia would be wholly  uncertain,
    and bearing in mind that the Appellants entry  to  the  United  Kingdom
    would not have an adverse economic impact on the United Kingdom, I find
    that there are sufficiently compelling circumstances in the  case  such
    that the  Appellants'  continued  exclusion  from  the  United  Kingdom
    amounts to a disproportionate interference with the  Appellants'  right
    to family life with the Sponsor.

     Decision

51.  (i)      On 25 May 2016 I found that the judge's decision involved  the
    making of     materials or law, and I set aside the decision.

     (ii)     I re-make the decision,  dismissing  the  Appellants'  appeals
    under the     immigration rules, but allowing the  Appellants'  appeals
    on human rights   grounds.
