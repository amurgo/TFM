                                  Anonymity

I make an order under r.14(1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any  matter  likely
to lead members of the public to identify  the  respondents.  No  report  of
these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  them.    This
direction applies to both the appellant  and  to  the  respondents  and  all
other persons. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to  contempt
of court proceedings.
I make this direction because the first respondent made  a  claim  that  she
had been trafficked and also because the second and  third  respondents  are
children.
The parties at liberty to apply to discharge this order, with reasons.

                                  DECISION

 1. I shall refer to Miss MTV hereafter as the "first claimant",  Miss  AKP
    as the second claimant and Master HGD as the third claimant.

 2. This is a decision on the papers without a hearing pursuant to paras  4
    and 5 of the Senior President's "Pilot Practice Direction:  Contingency
    Arrangements in the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal"  (hereafter
    the "PPD") issued on 19 March 2020 on a pilot basis for a period of six
    months and extended subsequently for a  further  six  months  until  18
    March 2021 and rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
    2008.

 3. By my Directions dated 5 November 2020 and sent to the  parties  on  12
    November 2020 (hereafter the "November 2020 Directions"),  I  indicated
    to the parties my provisional view concerning the appropriate  disposal
    of the Secretary of State's appeals. I gave  detailed  reasons  for  my
    provisional view. I then issued directions which gave  the  parties  an
    opportunity to make submissions and/or object to my provisional view.

 4. Neither party made any  submissions  or  objected  within  the  periods
    specified in the November 2020 Directions.  Nor have any objections  or
    submissions been received to date.

 5. In the period since the November 2020 Directions were issued, Fordham J
    delivered his judgment in  R  (JCWI)  v  The  President  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) [2020] EWHC 3103 (Admin).   I
    have considered the judgment. Fordham J did not find that the  PPD  was
    unlawful. Furthermore, the judgment in R (JCWI) did not  concern  cases
    in which the Upper  Tribunal  has  indicated  its  provisional  view(s)
    concerning    the    disposal    of    the    appeal    and     invited
    submissions/objections, which is the subject of paras 4-5 of the PPD.

 6. For the reasons given at paras 1 to 13 of the November 2020  Directions
    and at paras 4-5 above, I dispose of the Secretary of  State's  appeals
    against the decision of the Judge to allow the appeals on human  rights
    grounds as follows:

      i)    That the Judge intended to allow the  appeals  of  each  of  the
       claimants on human rights  grounds  and  that  the  section  of  her
       decision under the heading "Notice of decision" should  be  read  as
       follows:

                       "The first appellant's appeal is dismissed on  asylum
           grounds.
                       The first appellant's is  dismissed  on  humanitarian
           protection grounds.
                       The appeals of the appellants are  allowed  on  human
           rights grounds (Article 8 of the ECHR only)."

      ii)   That the Secretary of State's appeal  against  the  decision  of
       the Judge to allow the second claimant's appeal is dismissed on  the
       ground that she has abandoned her grounds of appeal insofar as  they
       relate to the  Judge's  decision  to  allow  the  second  claimant's
       appeal.

      iii)  That any error of law in the decision of the Judge to allow  the
       appeals of the first  and  third  appellants  is  not  material  and
       therefore the Secretary  of  State's  appeals  against  the  Judge's
       decision to allow their appeals is dismissed.

DECISION

 7. The First-tier Tribunal did not make any material  error  of  law.  The
    Secretary of State's appeals against the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to allow the appeals of the claimants are dismissed.
