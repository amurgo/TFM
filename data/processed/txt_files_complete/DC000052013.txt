For the Appellant:     Dr A Samuels
For the Respondent:     Mr I Richards


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 7th  April
    2014.  The decision was in respect of an appeal by  Mr  David  Jeremiah
    Peters against a decision to deprive him  of  his  British  citizenship
    under Section 40A of the British Nationality Act 1981.

 2. The first issue we must deal with is that the application for leave  to
    appeal was lodged late by  the  Secretary  of  State.   The  delay  was
    something in the  order  of  four  weeks.  The  first  application  for
    permission was refused, that is by a Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal,
    and one of the grounds of refusal was that there was no good reason  to
    extend time.  However the  application  for  leave  came  before  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Allen.  He determined the application on  16th  July  of
    this year and concluded  amongst  other  things  that  it  was  in  the
    interests of justice for the application to be admitted.

 3. This morning Mr Peters has argued that  the  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  in
    reaching that conclusion failed to follow the guidance in a decision of
    this Tribunal in Ogundimu [2013] UKUT 00060 where the then President of
    the Upper Tribunal indicated that it would only be an exceptional  case
    where permission to appeal should be granted where  there  has  been  a
    significant delay and in the normal case where such a course  is  being
    considered by the Tribunal the normal course  thereafter  would  be  to
    list the permission application for oral hearing.   The  party  seeking
    leave to appeal then could seek to justify  the  delay  and  the  party
    responding to the proposed  appeal  could  argue  against  any  further
    extension of time.

 4. Upper Tribunal Judge Allen did not do that.  The delay in this case  is
    probably just on the cusp of that identified in Ogundimu.   However  we
    are perfectly satisfied that Upper Tribunal  Judge  Allen  applied  his
    mind to the fact that the application was out of  time  and  reached  a
    concluded decision on the point.  We cannot act as some kind  of  Court
    of Appeal in respect of Upper Tribunal Judge Allen.  We as a matter  of
    fact would have made precisely the same decision, not least because  of
    what we consider was the  wholly  erroneous  basis  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision.  However if Mr Peters had  wished  to  take  issue
    with the grant of permission that was something he should have done  at
    a much earlier stage and probably by a different route.

 5. The substance of the case concerns the fact that Mr  Peters  has  spent
    some considerable time in the United Kingdom and almost throughout  his
    time here has engaged in grossly fraudulent activity.  The findings  of
    fact of the First-tier Tribunal which appear from paragraphs 6 to 16 of
    the decision do not require detailed rehearsal. They  demonstrate  that
    he first appeared before criminal courts in this country in  1998.   He
    went to prison for offences of fraud in 2002 and in 2004,  having  been
    sent to prison for two years for offences of  various  kinds  involving
    fraud and deception, he was deported.  As the First-tier Tribunal found
    "he was by the date of his deportation a thoroughly dishonest person".

 6. Having been deported he applied for entry clearance to enter the United
    Kingdom  no more than  a  few  months  after  his  deportation,  giving
    details which were entirely different to those which he had given  when
    he first entered the United Kingdom.  He gave no detail at all  of  his
    previous history and therefore his entry into this country was, in  our
    judgment, fraudulent.

 7. Having arrived in this country he in due course  applied  for  and  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain.   That  grant  was  made  in  total
    ignorance of his immigration  history.   Subsequently  he  applied  for
    British citizenship, an application which as  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    found would normally have failed in the light of his  criminal  history
    and  his  immigration  history.   In  fact  it  succeeded  because  the
    authorities were entirely ignorant of the relevant  history  given  the
    fraud that Mr Peters was practising.  Mr Peters,  having  obtained  his
    leave to remain and his citizenship fraudulently, returned to  criminal
    fraud.  He was made the subject of a suspended  sentence  in  September
    2010 and then at the Central Criminal Court in July 2011 was  sentenced
    to a very wide range of  fraudulent  activity  that  involved  a  total
    defrauding of the public of something in excess of ï¿½160,000.

 8. The judge in the Old Bailey sentenced him to a total sentence  of  five
    years' imprisonment.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal had

         "no difficulty in finding that he (Mr Peters) acted  knowingly  and
         dishonestly  and  that  the  application  along   with   subsequent
         applications for indefinite leave to remain and British citizenship
         were merely further links in the chain of dishonesty and  deception
         which he had forged before he was deported and which  he  continued
         to forge after his return."

10. In all  of  those  circumstances  it  is  hardly  surprising  that  the
    Secretary of State concluded that deprivation of citizenship was  going
    to be entirely conducive to the public good.   This  was  a  man  whose
    claim to British citizenship was clearly wholly non-existent.

11. The First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal against the  deprivation  of
    citizenship. They did so under Article 8 of  the  European  Convention.
    The way in which they purported to do so was by finding that to deprive
    Mr Peters of citizenship would interfere with  his  private  or  family
    life by removing from him the  chance  to  make  an  application  under
    Regulation 15A of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  That was not
    an application he had made. How it could be an interference with  human
    rights to deprive the appellant (as he then was) of  something  he  had
    not done and showed no intention of doing is difficult to identify.

12.  Moreover  on  reading  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006,  in
    particular Regulation 15A, it is perfectly clear that Mr  Peters  could
    not possibly bring himself within  the  Regulations.   The  Regulations
    permit somebody to apply for what  is  called  a  derivative  right  of
    residence.  Thus, somebody who does not themselves have any entitlement
    to reside in  the  United  Kingdom  may  satisfy  some  criteria  under
    Regulation 15A.

13. One of the criteria is that if the person applying is a  primary  carer
    of a British citizen. A primary carer is defined as either  the  person
    who has primary responsibility for that person's care or a  person  who
    shares equally the responsibility for that person's care with one other
    person who is not an exempt person.  The  case  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was put on the premise that Mr Peters  fell  into  the  second
    category of primary carer, that is he shared equally the responsibility
    of the care of children who were British citizens with one other person
    who was not an exempt person.  The other person who was said to  be  an
    exempt person was his wife.  His wife is a British citizen.  There  was
    a clear finding of fact to that effect we  have  seen  the  documentary
    evidence which would substantiate it.   It  follows  that  she  was  an
    exempt  person  under  the  Regulations.   Therefore,   there   is   no
    conceivable basis upon which Mr Peters could make such  an  application
    even if he chose to do so.  It follows that the  entire  basis  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision was  completely  flawed.   The  Tribunal
    also discussed at some length the principles set out in Zambrano  which
    for reasons we do not need to elaborate have absolutely no relevance to
    this case at all.

14. It follows  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  so
    fundamentally flawed that it cannot stand and we must set it aside.  Mr
    Peters this morning through his representative  has  acknowledged  that
    there is no material that could be put before us that  was  not  before
    the First-tier Tribunal. There  is  no  material  on  the  decision  to
    deprive Mr Peters of citizenship, that being the decision under review,
    which cannot be identified and determined from the facts  as  found  by
    the First-tier Tribunal.

15. Therefore, this Tribunal is in a perfectly proper  position  to  remake
    the decision today and it has been conceded that that is an appropriate
    course for us to take.

16. We remake the decision.  We determine that the decision to  deprive  Mr
    Peters of his British citizenship was entirely appropriate.  His appeal
    against that decision is dismissed.
