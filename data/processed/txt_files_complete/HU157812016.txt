For the Respondent:    Mr S I Ali, Solicitor of Everest Law Solicitors (19-
20 Chambers)


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


1.   An error of law was established and reasons  given  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge King on 30 May 2018.  Submissions as to venue  for  remaking  the
    Original Tribunal's decision were invited but unresolved.
2.   On 26 June 2018 I gave directions at a  hearing,  attended  by  Mr.  C.
    Avery S.P.O. for the Secretary of State and Mr. S. I. Ali Solicitor for
    Kamala Rai, to the parties.  I do not know why despite twice trying  to
    get this matter transferred it is still with the UT (IAC).

3.   The directions were as follows:

    1.   List for hearing at Hatton Cross, not before FtT Judge Davidson.
    2.   Nepali interpreter required.
    3.   Time Estimate: one hour.
    4.   List for CMRH in the FtT (IAC) if required.
    5.   Rehearing on all issues.  No findings of fact to stand.
    6.   Any additional evidence or submissions to be filed by either party
         not less than ten working days before further hearing unless a CMRH
         or PTR directs otherwise.

Signed                                  Date12 February 2019
