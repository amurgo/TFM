                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the Appellant in this appeal to the Upper Tribunal  as
    the Secretary of State and the Respondent as the Claimant.  On 12  June
    2014 the Claimant was refused entry clearance to come to the UK to join
    his spouse and Sponsor, Mrs Mariyamalar  Yogamoorthy  with  a  view  to
    settlement.  His appeal was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge A
    W Khan) in a determination promulgated on  9th  March  2015.   However,
    permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  subsequently  granted
    and, in a decision promulgated on 23  October  2015  I  set  aside  the
    decision of Judge Khan, albeit preserving a good deal of his  findings,
    on the basis that in concluding that the Appellant had not filed  false
    documents in support of his application, he had  applied  an  incorrect
    standard of proof.  This necessitated a further hearing  before  me  so
    that I could re-make the decision within the Upper Tribunal.

 2. By way of recapping, the  application  for  entry  clearance  had  been
    considered under Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.   There  were  a
    number of components to the decision.  The Entry Clearance Officer took
    the view that the Claimant had lodged payslips relating to his  Sponsor
    and her claimed employment with a firm called Beake Convenience,  which
    were false.  Thus the  application  was  refused  under  paragraph  EC-
    P.1.1(c).  Further, it was not  accepted  that  the  Claimant  and  his
    Sponsor were in a genuine and subsisting relationship.  Finally, it was
    said that  the  Claimant  had  failed  to  meet  the  English  language
    requirements and was  not  exempt  from  those  requirements  under  E-
    ECP.4.2.

 3. Judge Khan found in favour of the Claimant on all counts.  He  accepted
    that there was  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  between  the
    parties.  He found that the wage slips were not  false  documents.   He
    found that the Claimant was  exempt  from  the  English  language  test
    requirements.

 4. As to the matter of the allegedly false documents, he said this;

         "14. I therefore turn to the issue of whether  the  documents  from
             Beake Convenience Stores are false.  The document verification
             report states that the Appellant said in his Visa  Application
             Form  that  his  Sponsor  had  two  jobs,  namely  with   City
             Facilities Management employed at Asda Superstores  and  Beake
             Convenience Store.  HMRC checks corroborated that the  Sponsor
             was employed at Asda Superstores but checks indicated that she
             was not employed with Beake  Convenience  Store  and  was  not
             employed for  the  duration  of  the  payslips  submitted  and
             therefore the documents were  false.   Against  that,  I  have
             considered the documents that were submitted  in  relation  to
             the Sponsor's employment with Beake Convenience Store  in  the
             form of confirmation from an accountant in a  letter  of  12th
             February 2014, payslips and a letter from the  owners  of  the
             store.  The problem I  have  with  the  document  verification
             report is that it simply states that HMRC checks indicate that
             the Sponsor was not currently employed and  was  not  employed
             for the duration of the payslips submitted.  This  could  only
             be on the basis that HMRC did not know of the employment  with
             Beake Convenience Store and does not necessarily mean that the
             Sponsor was not employed there.  In accordance with  the  case
             of RP (Nigeria) [2006] UKAIT 00086, the burden of proof is  on
             the Respondent to show that  a  document  is  forged  and  the
             standard of proof is more than on a balance of  probabilities.
             It is a high standard of proof and I am not satisfied that the
             Respondent has discharged this to the requisite standard.  The
             Sponsor could very well have been employed  by  the  store  in
             question but was not registered for income tax  purposes  when
             the search was made which means HMRC would have no records  of
             such employment.  In any event, the owners of the  store  said
             in their letter of 9th February  2014  that  the  Sponsor  was
             employed  as  a  part-time  store  assistant  on  a  permanent
             contract since 3rd January 2014 and worked  a  30  hour  week.
             Her PAYE reference was  supplied.   Also,  significantly,  the
             letter  states  that  for  tax  purposes,  the  business   was
             registered in their name, namely Puvanendrarasha and not Beake
             Convenience Store which could  explain  the  reason  why  HMRC
             checks did not reveal that the Sponsor  was  employed  by  the
             store because a check is only as good as when a  correct  name
             is searched.  I therefore find that the Respondent has  failed
             to satisfy me that the documents are a forgery."

 5. I set the decision aside because I was satisfied that, with respect  to
    the allegations surrounding false documentation, the burden  of  proof,
    which  did  rest  upon  the  Respondent,  was  one  of  a  balance   of
    probabilities, albeit that the evidence relied upon had to be subjected
    to a heightened scrutiny, rather  that  any  higher  standard.   I  did
    however, preserve  the  remaining  findings  and  conclusions.  A  full
    explanation with respect to all of this is to be found  in  my  setting
    aside decision referred to above.

 6. At the reconvened hearing  (sometimes  referred  to  as  a  continuance
    hearing) the issues, therefore, as agreed with the parties, were narrow
    ones.  I had to consider whether false documents had been  relied  upon
    or not. Mr Richards, quite properly, accepted that if I were to resolve
    that issue against him then, in remaking the decision, I  should  allow
    the Claimant's appeal.

 7. I heard oral evidence from the Sponsor.   She  told  me  that  she  was
    working for Beake Convenience Stores at the material times and that she
    had not provided any false documents.  She would be paid  monthly  and,
    usually, her wage would be paid into the bank but sometimes  she  would
    be given cash.  She also provided some bank statements.

 8. Mr Richards, having heard the evidence and having considered  the  bank
    statements said that the  most  likely  explanation  for  the  concerns
    expressed by the Entry Clearance Officer was that the  employer  (Beake
    Convenience Stores) was simply registered in a different name  for  tax
    purposes.  That was why, when the respondent had enquired with HMRC, no
    trace of the employment could be found.  Given  that  very  fundamental
    and, in  my  judgment  entirely  appropriate  concession,  it  was  not
    necessary for me to hear from Ms Reid.

 9. In the circumstances there is really no more I need to  say.  I  accept
    the Appellant did not file any false documents  and  that  the  Sponsor
    was, at all material times, employed with Beake Convenience  Stores  as
    claimed.   I accept the concession of  Mr  Richards  that  it  is  more
    likely than not there is  an  entirely  innocent  explanation  for  the
    concerns of the Entry Clearance Officer.  I conclude that the  Claimant
    meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules and did so at the  date
    of application and the date of decision.

10. In light of the above, in remaking the decision, I allow the appeal  of
    the Claimant against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer of  12
    June 2014 refusing to grant him entry clearance to come to the UK.



Conclusions

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside.

I remake the decision and allow the Claimant's appeal.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  I  make  no
anonymity order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I make a whole fee award in the sum of ï¿½140.  This is because, in  my  view,
the Entry Clearance Officer could have undertaken  further  back  up  checks
before reaching the adverse decision he did reach and  it  would  have  been
reasonable to have expected him to do so.
