Officer




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants, Kanwardeep Dhawan and Vijay Kommaraju, are citizens  of
    India.  The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against  the
    decision  of  the  respondent  dated  21  April  2013  refusing   their
    applications to remain in the United Kingdom as Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrants.  The First-tier Tribunal (Judge Shimmin), in a  determination
    promulgated on 24 October 2013, dismissed the appeals.  The  appellants
    now appeal, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The issue in the appeal is a relatively narrow  one  and  concerns  the
    construction of paragraph 41 of Appendix A of HC  395.  To  qualify  as
    Entrepreneur Migrants, the appellants had to show that  they  possessed
    at least �50000. That sum must be evidenced by:

    (ii) For money held in the UK only, a recent personal bank or  building
    society statement from each UK financial institution holding the funds,
    which confirms the amount  of  money  available.  Each  statement  must
    satisfy the following requirements:

    .....

    (4) the account must be in the applicant's own name only (or both names
    for an entrepreneurial team), not in the name of a  business  or  third
    party;

    At [32], Judge Shimmin recorded that Mr Balbalia  (for  the  appellants
    before the First-tier Tribunal) submitted  that  the  purpose  of  sub-
    paragraph (4) of paragraph 41 was to provide that the bank  account  in
    question should not be in the name of a business or third party.  Judge
    Shimmin went  on  to  record  that  Mr  Balbalia  submitted  that  "the
    respondent was treating each appellant as the third party of the other.
     He submits that the account [properly, the separate accounts  held  by
    each of the two appellants in their sole names] satisfied the Rules  if
    it is in the name of  the  appellant  or  both  of  them."   The  Rules
    provided that each appellant should have access to  a  minimum  sum  of
    �50,000; as the grounds record, Mr  Dhawan held funds in a  Lloyds  TSB
    account totalling �25,505.  Mr Kommaraju also had money in a Lloyds TSB
    account (�25,003).  The problem for the appellants lay in the fact that
    the money was not held in a joint account but in separate  accounts  in
    their respective individual names.

 3. Judge Shimmin did not agree with the analysis submitted by Mr Balbalia.
     He found that "the Rule requires each  appellant  to  have  access  to
    �50,000.  In this case each party does  not  have  such  access  unless
    their business partner is treated as a third party."

 4. I find that Judge Shimmins' construction of  the  relevant  Immigration
    Rule is correct.  The requirement for  the  specified  funds  is  quite
    clear in the Rules.  The bank account holding the funds must be in  the
    applicant's own sole name or joint names for  an  entrepreneurial  team
    (as in this case).  Funds held in a joint bank account are  held  joint
    and severally.  In law, this means that all of the money in the account
    may be controlled or disposed of as his or  her  absolute  property  by
    each of the account holders.  In other words,  the  effect  of  holding
    money in a joint account is the same as if one held  the  money  in  an
    account in one's own sole name.  For the two separate bank accounts  of
    these two individual appellants to be treated as if they constituted  a
    single joint account frankly makes no  sense  at  all.   In  law,  each
    applicant only had ownership and absolute control of the funds held  in
    their respective bank accounts.  In the cases of each appellant,  those
    funds were insufficient to satisfy the Immigration Rules.

 5. The second part of the appeal is  advanced  on  the  alternative  basis
    that, whilst Judge Shimmin may have been correct in his construction of
    the Immigration Rules,  he failed to apply  the  so-called  flexibility
    policy which was addressed by the Tribunal  in  Rodriguez  (Flexibility
    Policy)  [2013]  UKUT  00042.   The  grounds  submit  that  the   judge
    incorrectly found that the flexibility policy  of  the  respondent  had
    ceased by the time of the applications in these appeals and  have  been
    replaced by paragraph 245AA.  The judge found that paragraph 245AA  did
    not assist the appellants who submit that they should have been allowed
    by the respondent further time to submit a letter from their respective
    banks which stated unequivocally that the money  in  each  account  was
    freely available to the other applicant.

 6. In the light of what I have said above regarding the  nature  of  joint
    bank accounts,  I  am  not  persuaded  that  such  a  letter  would  be
    sufficient to satisfy the requirement  of  Appendix  A.   However,  the
    appellants do not dispute the  judge's  finding  that  paragraph  245AA
    could  not  assist  them.   They  seek,  instead,  to  prove  that  the
    evidential flexibility policy examined in  Rodriguez  rather  than  the
    later Immigration Rule, should have compelled the  respondent  to  give
    the applicants extra time to obtain the necessary  letters  from  their
    banks.  That argument is no longer tenable in the light of the Court of
    Appeal decision  in  Rodriguez  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  2.   The  evidential
    flexibility policy was never intended to enable applicants  to  perfect
    faulty  applications  by  the  submission  of  entirely  new  evidence.
    Whether or not Judge Shimmin was wrong to find that the policy had been
    replaced by the Immigration Rule, the applicants could not  succeed  in
    any event.

 7. For the reasons I have stated above, these appeals are dismissed.

DECISION

 8. These appeals are dismissed.
