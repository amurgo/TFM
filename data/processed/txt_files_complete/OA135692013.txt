                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Entry Clearance Officer's  appeal  against  a  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Pirotta which was  made  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 5 February 2014 following a hearing at Birmingham on  29
    January 2014.  For ease of reference throughout  this  determination  I
    shall refer to Mr  Rameez  who  was  the  original  appellant  as  "the
    claimant" and to the Entry  Clearance  Officer  who  was  the  original
    respondent as "the Entry Clearance Officer".

 2. The facts can be stated very briefly.  The claimant who is a citizen of
    Pakistan was born on 28 March 1992.  In February 2013  he  married  Mrs
    Mahmood who is a British citizen living in the United  Kingdom  and  he
    applied to enter the United Kingdom as her spouse.  In order to satisfy
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules  it  was  necessary  for  him
    among other matters to supply evidence in a  prescribed  form  to  show
    that the sponsor had income above the  threshold  of  ï¿½18,600.   It  is
    accepted and the judge found that this requirement was not  technically
    satisfied.  For this reason the application was refused.

 3. On appeal  the  judge  while  finding  that  the  requirement  was  not
    technically met did find  at  paragraph  18  that  "[the  sponsor]  has
    established in this appeal by equally probative evidence that the facts
    are as stated and that she does meet the income threshold stipulated in
    Appendix FM".   The  judge  gave  her  reasons  for  this  decision  at
    paragraphs 24 and 25 as follows:

         "24. The decision to refuse entry on the basis of the  Appendix  FM
             criteria is not unreasonable in the  circumstances  when  made
             but the persistence of that decision is not proportionate  and
             there  ...   exists   sufficient   compelling,   compassionate
             circumstances to conclude that it  would  be  unreasonable  to
             require the appellant to make a fresh application which  would
             be bound to succeed.  The decision to require the appellant to
             meet the criteria  of  Appendix  FM  in  a  fresh  application
             interferes with her Article 8 rights  to  private  and  family
             life with the appellant.

         25.  To require a fresh application would involve further delay and
             expense, merely to comply with  the  strict  criteria  of  the
             Immigration  Rules.   Delay  and  further  expenses  in  these
             circumstances would breach the rights  of  the  appellant  and
             sponsor to Article 8 rights to private  and  family  life  and
             would not be justified  or  proportionate  to  the  policy  of
             immigration control or the fair application of entry  criteria
             to all applicants."

 4. On behalf of the Entry Clearance  Officer  Ms  Isherwood  submits  that
    there being a requirement under Appendix FM(SE) to supply  evidence  in
    specified form, the appeal was bound to fail under the Rules  and  that
    in order for such an appeal to succeed under Article 8 there had to  be
    a finding that this case was out of the ordinary; it was  not  open  to
    the judge just to ignore the requirements of the Rules and the decision
    accordingly had to be set aside and re-made.

 5. In my judgment this is plainly right.  I have regard also now as I must
    to the decision of the Court of Appeal in the recently decided case  of
    MM & Others [2014] EWCA Civ 985 in which it was  made  clear  that  the
    Secretary of State had been entitled to impose requirements  under  the
    Rules and that for an Article 8  claim  to  succeed  there  had  to  be
    circumstances beyond the fact that the failure to meet the requirements
    of the Rules was technical.  It is clear in this case that the  judge's
    finding  that  the  decision  on  the  basis  of  the  Rules  was   not
    proportionate is not adequately reasoned and was not open to her.

 6. I must make one other observation with regard  to  this  determination.
    At paragraph 7 the judge states  that  "it  is  for  the  appellant  to
    satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that  at  the  date  of  the
    decision appealed he was able to meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules
    applicable to him" but then at paragraph 17 she goes  on  when  setting
    out her findings to state that "I am satisfied to the  lower  level  of
    proof required of an appellant that...".  While nothing turns  on  this
    in the circumstances of this appeal that is not a correct statement  of
    the law.  The test was not whether or not the judge was  satisfied  "to
    the lower level of proof required of an appellant" but as the judge had
    stated correctly at paragraph 7 the standard of proof was  the  balance
    of probabilities.  I am obliged to make  this  observation  because  in
    another determination which was recently considered by another judge of
    the Upper Tribunal, the judge has made the same error in precisely  the
    same terms.  The judge had also referred at paragraph 7 to  the  burden
    of proof being "on the balance of probabilities" yet  in  paragraph  17
    had referred to being satisfied to the "lower level of  proof  required
    of an appellant".  It seems that the judge  may  be  using  a  template
    which is not appropriate when considering entry clearance cases and  if
    this is the position this should not occur in the future.

 7. It follows that I must re-make the decision and I do so  having  regard
    to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in MM & Others referred to above
    and in particular to the observation at paragraph  137  to  the  effect
    that a British citizen does not have a right to a family  life  in  the
    UK.  There is in my judgment nothing that is exceptional in  this  case
    and no reasons have been put before me as would justify  allowing  this
    appeal under Article 8 in circumstances where it is bound to fail under
    the Rules.

 8. I should state  that  before  this  appeal  was  heard  the  claimant's
    solicitors wrote to the Tribunal stating that the  claimant  wished  to
    "withdraw the matter from  the  Upper  Tribunal  as  "the  family  have
    decided to submit a fresh application".  This letter was put  before  a
    judge of the Upper Tribunal (not myself) and a response was sent to the
    claimant's solicitors stating that the request to withdraw  the  appeal
    "misconstrues the nature of the appeal with which the Upper Tribunal is
    seized" because it was the Entry Clearance Officer who had been granted
    permission to appeal the determination allowing the appeal and this  is
    what was now before the Upper Tribunal.  The solicitors  were  informed
    that the hearing would proceed as listed and that it was a  matter  for
    the claimant as to whether or not he  wished  to  concede  the  appeal.
    Under Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  by
    Rule 17(2) "Notice of withdrawal will not take effect unless the  Upper
    Tribunal consents to the withdrawal" (except in circumstances which  do
    not apply in this case).  In light of the response which  was  sent  to
    the  claimant's  solicitors  and  the  matters  set  out  within   this
    determination I do not consent to this appeal being withdrawn, but will
    re-make this decision and dismiss the claimant's appeal.

 9. Before concluding my determination, it is appropriate to record that on
    behalf of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  Ms  Isherwood  informed  the
    Tribunal that there was no reason now why a fresh application which the
    Tribunal has been told the claimant  intends  to  make  should  not  be
    considered on its merits and if, as the judge considered was likely  to
    be the case, the requirements of the Rules are now satisfied  and  this
    is demonstrated in the specified form, there does not appear to be  any
    reason why such a fresh application should not be successful.  However,
    that is not a matter for me.



Decision

I set aside the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pirotta  as
containing a material error of law and substitute the following decision:

The claimant's appeal is dismissed both under the Rules  and  under  Article
8.
