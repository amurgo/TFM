Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr P D Norris (LR)
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmed (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are citizens of Nigeria.  The first and second Appellant
    are husband and wife.  The first Appellant was  born  on  25th  October
    1975 and the second Appellant was born on 11th July  1980.   They  have
    two children, one a son born on  10th June  2007,  who  is  the  third
    Appellant, and the other a daughter, born on 3rd May 2012, who  is  the
    fourth Appellant.  At the  date  of  the  decision  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge the third Appellant, the eldest child, was a  few  weeks
    short of being 9 years of age,  and  the  youngest  child,  the  fourth
    Appellant was just 4 years of age.

 2. The Appellants appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against  the  decision
    of the Respondent Secretary of State dated  24th  March  2015  refusing
    their application for leave to remain in the UK on the basis  of  their
    family and private life rights.

 3. The Appellants' appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Cockrill
    and  promulgated  on  18th  May  2016.   At   paragraph   30   of   the
    determination,  the  judge  recognised  that  the  first   and   second
    Appellants had been in the  UK  unlawfully  and  they  could  perfectly
    properly return back to Nigeria, find work and accommodation, and  look
    after their young family in a conventional way.  However, applying  the
    Tribunal judgment in PD (Article 8 - conjoined family claims) Sri Lanka
    [2016] UKUT 00108, the judge held that "it is important when looking at
    the family as a whole to fully appreciate the position of an  Appellant
    that does meet the requirements of the Rules" and that,

         "With the third Appellant the requirements of the Rules by  virtue,
         really of the passage of  time  are  arguably  met.   There  is  no
         suggestion in these cases that the first and second  Appellants  do
         not have other than a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
         with their children.  What we have, therefore, is the position that
         the third Appellant can meet the Rules.  What should happen to  the
         other three Appellants?"  (Paragraph 30).

 4. The judge went on to say that the needs  and  interests  of  the  third
    Appellant, who had been in the UK since his birth on  10th  June  2007,
    with his parents having entered the UK illegally on 17th  October  2006
    by using the services of an agent (see paragraph 2).  The judge brought
    into the equation, when looking at the public interest, the factors set
    out in Section 117B of the 2002 Act.  (Paragraph 30).

 5. The judge went on to note that the third Appellant  was  a  "qualifying
    child" because he had been in the UK for  more  than  seven  years  and
    "that brings to the fore, again, the central tests  of  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom"  (paragraph
    32).

 6. The ultimate conclusions reached by the judge were on the basis that

         "The first, second and fourth Appellants can  succeed  outside  the
         Rules on Article 8 grounds because of  the  need  to  maintain  the
         family unit as a whole.  That is a  desirable  aim  to  ensure  the
         welfare  of  the  two  children,  to  retain  and   foster   family
         relationships" (paragraph 34).

    The judge  noted  that  this  process  of  reasoning  did  place  "some
    considerable weight on the position of the third Appellant, but looking
    at the circumstances overall, it seems  to  me  the  right  and  proper
    course to take" because of what  the  Supreme  Court  had  said  in  ZH
    (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4, where it was emphasised that, "a child's best
    interests should not be compromised on account of the misdemeanours  of
    its parents.  That seems to be pertinent to the position in respect  of
    the third  and  fourth  Appellants,  vis-ï¿½-vis  the  first  and  second
    Appellants" (paragraph 34).

 7. The appeal was allowed.

 8. The Grounds of  Appeal  by  the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State  laid
    emphasis on four distinct matters.  First, the judge had failed to have
    regard to EV Philippines [2014],  where  it  was  emphasised  that  the
    assessment of the balance of considerations did not  take  place  in  a
    vacuum and that regard had to  be  given  to  the  broader  immigration
    status and history of the parents.  Second, what this meant was that  a
    child's application could not be decided in isolation from  the  others
    because the application of the criterion of reasonableness  behold  the
    official to evaluate all the claims in the  round  and  determine  them
    together.  Third, the judge  failed  to  have  regard  to  Azimi-Moayed
    [2013] which makes it clear that seven years' residence from the age of
    4 is likely to be more significant than the seven years  of  a  child's
    life.  Fourth,  no  proper  consideration  was  given  as  to  why  the
    Appellants could not adapt to life in Nigeria where English  is  widely
    spoken, particularly given that the judge had held that the  first  and
    second Appellants, (the parents), "could perfectly properly  return  to
    Nigeria, find work and accommodation and look after their young  family
    in a conventional way" (paragraph 30).

 9. On 20th September 2016, permission to appeal was  given  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Shimmin.

10. At the hearing before me on 17th October 2016, Ms Z Ahmed, appearing as
    Senior Home Office Presenting Officer, argued that the judge had simply
    set out the relevant considerations without actually engaging with them
    and demonstrating how the balance of considerations fell to be  applied
    on the basis of an assessment exercise that was objectively  clear  for
    all to see.  For example, whilst the judge states at paragraph 29 that,
    the third Appellant has only known this country and is fully integrated
    into school here, such that this points "towards a conclusion  that  it
    is desirable that the third Appellant, to promote his  welfare,  should
    be permitted to stay here" (paragraph 29), the judge, in  referring  to
    the "countervailing factor", had simply said that this "could  be  that
    the parents, that is the first and second  Appellants,  had  been  here
    unlawfully" (paragraph 30).  It did  not  appear  that  the  judge  had
    actually engaged with the fact that they had been here unlawfully.  The
    conduct of their parents was relevant to the way in  which  the  public
    interest consideration was to be evaluated.  My attention was drawn  to
    the case of PD [2016] UKUT 00108, where  the  president  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal stated that,  "the  application  of  the  reasonableness  test
    involves  the  balance  of  all  material  facts  and   considerations"
    (paragraph 40).  I was also directed to the Court of Appeal judgment in
    Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803, where it was  emphasised  that  the  fact
    that the Appellants were financially independent did not mean  that  it
    was in the public interest that they should be granted leave to remain,
    because, "it only indicates that it is a negative  factor,  potentially
    capable of justifying her removal from the UK compatibly  with  Article
    8, if she is not financially independent" (paragraph 62).

11. For his  part,  Mr  Norris,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the  Appellants
    submitted that this was simply a disagreement with the decision of  the
    judge.  What the judge had here done was to first set  out  the  facts.
    He was clear early on that as far as the adult parents were  concerned,
    "they knew perfectly well when they came to this country that they were
    arriving here unlawfully" (paragraph 27).  Second, the judge had  given
    proper regard to both the Appellants' interests, in  the  form  of  the
    third Appellant's birth and upbringing in this country for the entirety
    of his life up to the age of over 8, with  the  observation  that  this
    points "towards a conclusion  that  it  is  desirable  that  the  third
    Appellant be permitted  to  stay  here  to  continue  that  pattern  of
    education and further involvement in British society"  (paragraph  29);
    as well as giving regard to the countervailing factor that the  parents
    "have been here unlawfully" such that, "they could  perfectly  properly
    return to Nigeria, find work and accommodation  and  look  after  their
    young family in a conventional way" (paragraph 30).  Thirdly, the judge
    had then, having considered the two separate sets of interests,  looked
    at the position of the third Appellant, found him to be  a  "qualifying
    child", and concluded that it would not be reasonable to expect him  to
    return to Nigeria on the  basis  that  the  Supreme  Court  had  in  ZH
    (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4, already held that the  misdemeanours  of  the
    Appellants are not to be visited upon a child who has been  in  the  UK
    for a lengthy period of time.  The decision could not  be  faulted  and
    there was no error of laws such that this Tribunal should intervene.

No Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error of law such that  it  falls  to  be  set
    aside under Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007.  My  reasons  are  as  follows.
    The question here is that of the application of the legal and statutory
    regime that the government has set up in evaluating  Article  8  claims
    and the considerations to which a judge must have regard.   It  is  for
    parliament to change the law just as it is for parliament to make it in
    a particular manner.  This is a case where the judge does  have  regard
    to  all  the  various  different  circumstances  of  this  claim.   The
    suggestion that the judge does not engage with the relevant  issues  is
    untenable.  The reference to the fact that the judge said  in  relation
    to "a countervailing factor" that it "could be that  the  parents  have
    been here unlawfully" (paragraph 30) does not  mean  to  say  that  the
    judge did not give this any consideration.  This is  not  just  because
    the judge had already earlier at paragraph 27 made it  perfectly  plain
    that the adult Appellants had arrived here unlawfully  and  "they  knew
    during the succeeding months and years when the third and  then  fourth
    Appellants  were  born,  that  they  were  here  without   any   proper
    permission" (paragraph 27).  It is, however, also  the  case  that  the
    judge further states, in relation to the  Appellants'  interests  that,
    "they could  perfectly  properly  return  to  Nigeria,  find  work  and
    accommodation and look after their young family in a conventional way".
     (Paragraph 30).

13. What has been important, is that the  judge's  assessment  has  focused
    upon the fact that this is a "qualifying child", when consideration  is
    given to the third Appellant, and that he is  a  child  who  "has  only
    known this country" and has lived at the same address in Orpington with
    his parents" and is "now fully integrated in school" and is "performing
    perfectly well" (paragraph 29), such that it is "the desirable  aim  to
    ensure the welfare of the two children, to retain and foster the family
    relationships" (at paragraph 34) that leads to the conclusion that  the
    children should remain in the UK and not be compelled to go to Nigeria.



14. The statement in the Grounds of Appeal that Azimi-Moayed has  not  been
    given proper consideration because the judge has failed to take account
    of the fact that the period from the age of 4  is  likely  to  be  more
    significant than the first seven years of a child's life, is  difficult
    to  comprehend,  in  circumstances  where  the  third   Appellant   has
    throughout his nine years of life, lived in the UK, having been born in
    this country.

15. Second, in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ  705,  the  Court  of  Appeal,
    under the heading "applying the  reasonableness  test"  made  it  clear
    that, "even on the approach of the Secretary of State, the fact that  a
    child has been here for seven years must be  given  significant  weight
    when carrying out the proportionality exercise" (paragraph  46).   This
    conclusion was arrived at by the court on the basis  of  the  published
    guidance in August 2015 from  the  IND  entitled  "family  life  (as  a
    partner or parent) and private life: ten year routes", in which, as the
    Court of Appeal stated, "it is expressly stated  that  once  the  seven
    years' residence requirement is satisfied, there  need  to  be  'strong
    reasons' for refusing leave (paragraph 11.2.4)".

16. The Court of Appeal observed, in relation to the seven year  period  so
    specified, that, "after such a period of time the child will  have  put
    down roots and developed social, cultural and educational links in  the
    UK such that it is likely  to  be  highly  disruptive  if  a  child  is
    required to leave  the  UK"  (paragraph  46).   This,  after  all,  was
    precisely what Judge Cockrill had expressly referred to at paragraph 29
    of his determination.  The decision reached cannot be described as  one
    that is perverse or irrational for these reasons.

Notice of Decision

17. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
