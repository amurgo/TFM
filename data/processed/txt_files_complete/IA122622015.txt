Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Ikoku, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria born on 17  September  1978.
         He entered the UK on 31 May 2005 with entry clearance as a  Tier  4
         student  valid  until  29  October  2005.  On  24  June  2006   the
         appellant's former partner  entered  the  UK  as  a  visitor.  Both
         overstayed. They had children born on 1 October 2008  and  28  June
         2011. The appellant sought leave to remain on 11 January  2010  but
         this was refused without a right of appeal  on  8  June  2010.  The
         appellant requested reconsideration.

      2. On 10 October 2014 the appellant  was  encountered  by  immigration
         officials working at a car body shop. He told them that  he  had  a
         partner and two children although he did not live  with  them.   He
         maintained that partly owned the business where he had been  found.
         He was served with Form IS.151A.

      3. The appellant's solicitors were contacted by  the  respondent  with
         regard to the reconsideration of his case and the  linking  of  his
         partner's case. They notified the respondent that his  partner  and
         children did not want  to  have  their  case  considered  with  the
         appellant's. They appear to have made separate applications.

      4. On 10 February 2016, the appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Walters at Taylor House and dismissed by  way  of  a
         determination promulgated  on  3  March  2016.  The  appellant  was
         unrepresented and produced a letter from  his  representatives  and
         three photographs of his children as evidence  in  support  of  his
         appeal.

      5. Permission was granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul  on  30
         September 2016 on the basis that the judge's  failure  to  consider
         section 117B (6) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
         2002 was arguably an error of law.

      6. The appellant's case, as put in the  grounds,  is  that  the  judge
         failed to adequately consider the provisions of s.  117B,  that  he
         failed to consider  that  the  appellant  had  contributed  to  the
         community in South London by paying business rates (some �4000 over
         three years) and repairing cars for Greenwich, Bexley and  Lewisham
         councils.  These  submissions  were  repeated  by  Mr   Ikoku   who
         maintained that this evidence boosted the  appellant's  chances  of
         success but was not  taken  into  account  by  the  judge.  It  was
         submitted  that  the  judge  speculated  when  he  found  that  the
         appellant had received NHS treatment, that  he  should  have  asked
         whether the appellant had paid for it privately, that  he  did  not
         take account of the  appellant's  contributions  to  a  local  road
         safety initiative or to the  British  Fire  Services  and  that  no
         regard was had to the appellant's involvement in the church. It was
         submitted that the appellant had two children  here  and  that  the
         eldest had been here for seven years. Although  neither  child  had
         lawful status, the  eldest  was  potentially  entitled  to  British
         nationality when she turned ten. As  the  parent  of  a  qualifying
         child, the appellant should not be removed. Reliance was placed  on
         Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803.

      7. For the respondent, Ms Ahmad submitted that the evidence of payment
         of rates was not before  the  judge.  The  judge  referred  to  the
         evidence produced at the hearing and the documents now relied on by
         the appellant were not available for the hearing. Further, contrary
         to what Mr Ikoku maintained, the children  were  not  part  of  the
         appellant's application. They had made a separate application  with
         their mother.

      8.  Ms  Ahmad  submitted  that   the   appellant's   submissions   had
         misunderstood the reasoning in Rhuppiah. At paragraphs 32,  62,  63
         and 65 the court considered the issues of precariousness and public
         interest and concluded that factors such as the  ability  to  speak
         English and financial independence were either neutral or  negative
         factors; they could never be factors  in  favour  of  an  appellant
         against the  public  interest.  She  submitted  that  even  if  the
         documents now relied on had been before the judge, they  would  not
         have advanced the case as there was nothing therein  to  show  that
         the appellant was financially independent and even  if  there  was,
         this would be a neutral factor. With respect to s.  117B  (6),  she
         pointed out that the appellant was required to have a  genuine  and
         subsisting parental relationship with  the  qualifying  child.  The
         judge had found that the evidence was "thin". Simply having a child
         was not enough. There was also the test of  reasonableness  and  in
         considering whether it would be reasonable for a child to leave the
         UK, the Tribunal was entitled to consider the appellant's  unlawful
         status and the unlawful status of his children. She  relied  on  MA
         (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA.

      9. Ms Ahmad also relied on IA (Somalia) [2007] EWCA Civ 323 and argued
         that for a judge to have made  a  material  error  in  omitting  to
         consider a piece of evidence, it would have to be the case that  he
         might have reached a different conclusion had  that  evidence  been
         considered.  There  were  no  material  errors  of   law   in   his
         determination and it should be upheld.

     10. Mr Ikoku responded. He submitted that the judge had accepted  there
         was family life between the appellant and his children  and  so  it
         followed that he accepted that their relationship  was  subsisting.
         With regard to the issue of reasonableness, the judge  should  have
         had regard  to  the  fact  that  the  appellant's  daughter  had  a
         contingent right to citizenship at the age  of  ten.  He  submitted
         that if the judge failed to consider evidence, then  the  issue  of
         materiality was moot. He asked for the  appeal  to  be  allowed  or
         remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

     11. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my determination  which
         I now give.

    Conclusions and findings

     12. The issue before  me  is  whether  the  judge  properly  considered
         section 117B when assessing the evidence and, if not, whether  that
         amounts to an error such as to cause his decision to be set  aside.



     13. Having carefully considered the determination,  the  file  and  the
         respondent's bundle, I am satisfied  that  the  evidence  from  the
         appellant before the judge consisted of:

             In the respondent's bundle:

                . School letter dated 3 November 2014 regarding [E]

                . Companies House registration of Femmy  Autos  on  9  March
                  2011

                .  Welcome  letter  from  Kingsway  International  Christian
                  Centre dated 9 February 2011

                . Invoice for payment from Local Authority Publicity dated 7
                  May 2013

                . Final reminder for payment  to  Femmy  Auto  Repairs  from
                  Sargom Fire dated 9 June 2012

                . Tenancy agreement for Femmy Auto  Repairs  dated  1  April
                  2014 at a rent of �600 per month

                . Invoices for rent and a deposit  for  Femmy  Auto  Repairs
                  requiring immediate payment for March -  August  2014  and
                  December 2014

                . Birth certificates for two children showing the  appellant
                  as their father. Registration of the birth of  the  eldest
                  child, [E], took place almost a year after her birth.

             Submitted at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

                . Covering letter from appellant's representatives dated  29
                  January 2015 sent with his article 8 application

                . Three photographs.

     14. The judge  also  considered  the  appellant's  oral  testimony  (as
         summarised at paragraphs 22-33). He then proceeded  to  assess  the
         evidence in the  context  of  section  117A-D.  The  considerations
         referred to in section 117A(2)(a), which are said by that provision
         to be applicable in all cases where the public  interest  is  under
         consideration, are:

                . The maintenance of effective immigration control

                . The ability of persons seeking to enter or remain to speak
                  English so that they are less of a burden  on  tax  payers
                  and better able to integrate into society

                . Whether a person is financially independent

                . Little  weight  to  be  given  to  a  private  life  or  a
                  relationship with a qualifying partner  established  at  a
                  time when a person is here unlawfully

                . Little weight to be  given  to  private  life  established
                  whether a person's status is precarious

                . Whether a person has a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                  relationship with a  qualifying  child  and  it  would  be
                  unreasonable to expect that child to leave the UK.

         A qualifying child is defined at s. 117D as a child under  the  age
         of 18 who is either British or has lived in the UK for a period  of
         seven years.

     15. In taking account of 117B, the judge noted that with respect to the
         issue of financial independence, the appellant had  been  receiving
         NHS treatment, that his child was  receiving  free  primary  school
         education,  that  his  stay  had  been  precarious  ever  since  he
         overstayed his visa and that he had set up a business when  he  had
         no lawful basis to do so.

     16. It  is  right  to  say,  as  the  appellant  has  argued,  that  no
         consideration was given to 117B(6). Whilst the  judge  was  plainly
         aware that the child was seven years old and  accepted  that  there
         was family life between her and the appellant, despite the evidence
         being "thin", he did not specifically address whether it  would  be
         reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK. In so far  as  that
         analysis is absent from the determination, the judged erred in law.



     17. However, that is not the end of  the  matter  as  I  must  consider
         whether the error is material; that is to say, whether it  is  such
         that it vitiates the decision made. I  do  not  accept  Mr  Ikoku's
         submission that materiality is a moot point where an issue has  not
         been considered. That is the very argument Ms  Ahmad  addressed  in
         her submissions with reference to IA (Somalia)  and  the  words  of
         Lord Justice Keene  at  paragraph  15.  If  it  can  be  said  with
         confidence that the judge would have arrived at the same conclusion
         had he considered the issue or evidence that was omitted  from  his
         analysis, then the error is not  material.  I  now  consider  Judge
         Walters' determination in accordance with that guidance.

     18. The judge considered that the appellant  had  not  shown  financial
         independence as he  was  receiving  NHS  treatment.  I  have  taken
         account of the submissions made by  Mr  Ikoku  on  this  point  but
         cannot agree that the judge made assumptions  and  that  he  should
         have asked the appellant if he had paid for treatment privately. It
         was the appellant's evidence that he had received treatment on  the
         NHS. That can only mean free treatment. Had he  received  treatment
         on a private basis, there is no reason why he would not  have  said
         so. The judge also noted that  the  appellant's  eldest  child  was
         receiving free education. Although the appellant gave evidence that
         he was willing to pay for it, he has not done so.

     19. Mr  Ikoku  made  strenuous  attempts  to  show  that  the  evidence
         established that  the  appellant  had  made  contributions  to  the
         community and was financially independent.  I  make  the  following
         comments on those submissions. Firstly, the business rates receipts
         relied upon were not before the judge although I accept  that  they
         were listed as an item in the  letter  of  January  2015  from  the
         appellant's representatives which was before him. Secondly, even if
         they had been  before  the  judge,  they  do  not  prove  financial
         independence. All they show is that rates were paid over  a  period
         of three years. As the  appellant's  evidence  to  the  immigration
         officers was that he was a part owner, there  is  nothing  to  show
         that he made the payments himself. Thirdly, even if  the  appellant
         had shown himself to be financially independent, this would only be
         a neutral factor. The appellant has  been  working  unlawfully  and
         there is no evidence that he has paid  tax  or  national  insurance
         contributions. Nevertheless, he has used the NHS and the  education
         services for his children. His children were born in NHS hospitals.
         He may have helped the local council by  repairing  some  of  their
         vehicles, but he has undermined, what  has  been  argued  to  be  a
         positive factor, by abusing the laws of this  country,  by  working
         unlawfully and by failing to show any evidence of payments  to  Her
         Majesty's Revenue and Customs. The so called payments to  the  Fire
         Services are, in fact, demands for payment to be  made.  Then  rent
         invoices similarly show requests for payment rather than the making
         of payments. The judge was entitled to find that the appellant  had
         failed to show financial independence. This is  a  negative  factor
         and one that  weighs  against  the  appellant  when  the  balancing
         exercise is undertaken.

     20. The judge  did  not  consider  the  appellant's  ability  to  speak
         English. I was not addressed on this point but assume,  as  he  was
         able to give oral testimony to the Tribunal without an interpreter,
         that he speaks English. This is a neutral factor.

     21. The judge considered  the  appellant's  unlawful  status.  In  that
         context the maintenance of immigration control is a  strong  public
         interest factor. The appellant entered the  UK  as  a  student  and
         overstayed for a  lengthy  period.  All  but  five  months  of  his
         residence  here  has  been  without  leave.  Lord   Justice   Sales
         considered the general public  interest  in  maintaining  effective
         immigration controls in relation to those granted limited leave  as
         students in Rhuppiah. He said (at paragraph 37):

             "It is relevant  to  mention  here  that  the  general  public
             interest in  maintaining  effective  immigration  controls  in
             relation to persons  granted  limited  leave  to  enter  as  a
             student is not simply to keep  immigration  within  manageable
             bounds so far as the burden on taxpayers  and  the  impact  on
             social cohesion is concerned. There is also a dimension of the
             interests of other prospective students wishing to come to the
             UK to study: if it proves to be unduly difficult to  remove  a
             student at the end of their period of study, there is  a  real
             prospect that leave to enter as a student will be granted less
             readily and in fewer cases, contrary to  those  interests.  In
             the light of the general public interest in the maintenance of
             effective immigration controls  (section  117B(1))  and  these
             particular  aspects  of  that  public  interest,  it  is   not
             unreasonable to expect a person who obtains leave to remain in
             the UK as a student to be prepared to  leave  at  the  end  of
             their period of study, as they have said they  intend  to  do,
             and to organise their private life accordingly"

     22. The appellant gave no explanation for overstaying his visa  and  no
         explanation for why his former partner overstayed her  visit  visa.
         No apologies were made and there has been no acknowledgment of  any
         wrong doing. The applicant has worked unlawfully, taking  away  the
         opportunity for a lawful resident to provide the  services  he  has
         provided. His illegal status and that of  his  former  partner  and
         both children are all matters the judge was entitled to have regard
         to.

     23. The judge considered the precariousness of the appellant's  status.
         The appellant has had a precarious status since his arrival as  his
         leave was short and for a specific purpose.  He  would  have  known
         that he was required to leave when his visa expired. Once his leave
         expired, he remained unlawfully and so the private life  he  claims
         to have established by way of his work and the church can be  given
         little weight. I reject the submission that a strong  private  life
         has been shown.

     24. Mr Ikoku focused his arguments on the judge's failure  to  consider
         117B (6). It is accepted that  the  appellant  has  one  qualifying
         child. Although she has no legal status, she  has  lived  here  for
         more than seven years. The public interest  does  not  require  the
         appellant to be removed where he has a subsisting relationship with
         such a child unless it would be reasonable for her to leave the UK.
         It has not been suggested that it would not. Her mother and sibling
         are both Nigerian as is she. Whilst she has spent  her  life  here,
         that does not necessarily mean she cannot reasonably be expected to
         leave. Ms Ahmad referred me to MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA where  the
         court found:

             "There can surely be little doubt that if  the  reasonableness
             test required a focus on the  position  of  the  child  alone,
             ignoring wider  considerations  of  immigration  control,  the
             argument for him being granted leave would be overwhelming. It
             would not be reasonable to require him to leave the  UK  given
             that he has spent virtually all his life here,  and  that  his
             autism can only effectively be treated in this country.

             But for reasons I have given, that is not the test. The  court
             can have regard to the wider public  interest,  including  the
             immigration history of the applicant and his parents".

     25. The appellant did not put forward any good reasons why it would  be
         unreasonable to expect his child to leave the UK. The fact that she
         would be entitled to apply for British nationality  in  the  future
         does not assist the case now. She could return with the  appellant,
         her  mother  and  brother  and  whilst  some  adjustment  would  be
         required, she is young enough to adapt. I therefore take  the  view
         that even if the judge had taken account of this  issue,  he  would
         still have reached the same decision given  the  reasonableness  of
         the child's returnability and the other negative factors that exist
         in this case.

     26. Decision

     27. The determination does not contain any errors of law such that  the
         decision should be set aside.

     28. The decision is upheld. The appeal is dismissed.
