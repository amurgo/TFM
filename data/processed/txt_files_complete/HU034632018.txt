                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




        1. Permission to appeal was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
           Beach on 12 September 2018 against the decision to  dismiss  the
           Appellant's Article 8 ECHR appeal made  by  First-tier  Tribunal
           Judge R R Hopkins in a decision and  reasons  promulgated  on  3
           August  2018.   The  Appellant  is  a  national  of  India,   an
           overstayer whose last leave to remain expired in 2014,  but  who
           has made a number of unsuccessful applications to  Secretary  of
           State for the Home Department since  then.  She  relied  on  her
           relationship to her husband, a British Citizen by naturalisation
           of Indian heritage, who was born in  Hong  Kong.   They  have  a
           daughter, also a British Citizen, who was born on 24 June  2016.
           (A further British Citizen child was born very recently.)


        2. The Respondent accepted that the Appellant's  relationship  with
           her  partner  and  child  were  genuine  and  subsisting.    The
           Respondent  refused  the  application  on  Suitability  grounds,
           because (it  was  said)  that  the  Appellant  had  submitted  a
           fraudulent TOEIC certificate.   The  Appellant's  partner  could
           care for her child if the Appellant returned to India to make an
           entry clearance application.


        3. Judge Hopkins found that Article 8 ECHR  was  engaged  but  that
           there were no insurmountable obstacles to  the  continuation  of
           family life in India, and gave extensive reasons:  see  [50]  of
           his decision and reasons.  The judge found  in  the  Appellant's
           favour  on  the  TOEIC/Suitability  issue.   Nevertheless,   the
           Appellant was unable to  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
           child's best interests were to remain with her parents,  and  it
           made little difference whether  the  child  was  in  the  United
           Kingdom or in India.  It was reasonable  for  the  Appellant  to
           leave the United Kingdom and she could  either  take  her  child
           with her (by implication while entry clearance  was  sought)  or
           the family could live in India.  Hence the appeal was dismissed.


      4.    Permission to appeal  was  granted  because  it  was  considered
           arguable  that  the  judge  had  not   properly   assessed   the
           reasonableness of the child leaving the United  Kingdom  in  the
           light of MA (Pakistan)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705.   There  was  no
           reference to the Respondent's policy.


      5.    Mr Rai for the Appellant relied on the grounds and submitted and
           the grant of permission to appeal.  The judge had erred  in  his
           proportionality assessment.  He had misdirected himself and  had
           not applied the reasonableness test.  Instead he had  looked  at
           the mother's conduct.  He had gone on to conflate reasonableness
           with  insurmountable  obstacles,  and  had  reached  conflicting
           findings of fact.  KO (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC  53,  nevertheless
           clarified the law and had  to  be  applied,  decided  after  the
           judge's decision and so not available to him.   "Reasonableness"
           was the test.  The judge had not engaged sufficiently  with  the
           reality that family unity would be affected if the Appellant had
           to return to India. The onwards appeal should be allowed.


        6. Mr Jarvis for the Respondent opposed  the  onwards  appeal.   KO
           (Nigeria)  (above)  placed  substance   over   form,   and   the
           determination showed that the judge had in  fact  addressed  the
           central issue of reasonableness, without over  elaboration.   KO
           (Nigeria) emphasised that a "real world" approach was needed and
           that was what the judge had done.  The judge had  not  conflated
           any relevant tests but had examined the whole of the facts  when
           reaching a proportionate decision.   Appendix  FM  was  not  the
           final word in all partner appeals but  it  indicated  where  the
           margin of appreciation normally lay.


        7. Mr Rai in reply reiterated his earlier  points  which  had  been
           explored in dialogue with the tribunal.  There was a problem  of
           family separation and the judge  had  speculated  about  how  it
           might be avoided.


        8. The grant of permission to appeal was in the tribunal's  view  a
           generous one.  The tribunal accepts the submissions made  by  Mr
           Jarvis. The determination was a notably full and careful one and
           the decision reached was open to the judge for  the  reasons  he
           gave,  notwithstanding  clarification  of  the  law  since   the
           determination was promulgated.


        9. As Mr Rai recognised, KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53 had  not  been
           available to the judge, and the grant of  permission  to  appeal
           had  been  based  on  MA  (Pakistan)  (above)  which  has   been
           disapproved and superseded.  Nevertheless the  substance  of  KO
           (Nigeria) was applied.  At [52] and [56] the judge examined  the
           question of whether it was  reasonable  to  expect  the  British
           Citizen child to go to India  with  her  mother  the  Appellant.
           Obviously there was no compulsion as the judge  recognised.  The
           child is only 2 years of age when it would be expected to remain
           with its mother (contrary to the views expressed in the  reasons
           for refusal letter). The judge also took into account  the  fact
           that another child was expected (now happily born), also to be a
           British Citizen.  The judge had cleared  the  Appellant  of  the
           deception allegation made by the Respondent, and noted that  her
           status had been  precarious  and,  latterly,  without  leave  to
           remain.  This was in no sense held against  the  child/child  to
           be, as it was simply a statement of fact: the mother had no form
           of leave to remain by the date of the hearing and indeed had  in
           effect clung on in the United Kingdom since the  curtailment  of
           her leave to remain in 2014.  Earlier the judge had  noted  that
           her relationship with her partner had commenced  while  she  had
           leave to  remain:  see  [54]  of  the  determination,  but  that
           relationship was not one recognised by  the  Immigration  Rules,
           nor had compliance with Appendix FM been shown.


       10. The tribunal cannot accept that the judge conflated any relevant
           tests, as the constant thread of his approach was  to  determine
           reasonableness, reflecting KO (Nigeria).  The  Appellant  was  a
           recent entrant to the United Kingdom (2011) and came  to  study.
           Like so many Tier 4  (General)  Students  of  that  period,  her
           college licence was revoked.  Her further history is set out  at
           [6] onwards of the determination and need not be  recited  here.
           The fact is that her links with the United Kingdom  were  recent
           and tenuous.


       11. As with so many similar appeals which come before the First-tier
           Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal in the  Immigration  and  Asylum
           Chamber, this appeal was really about personal choice, a  choice
           which does not exist under Article 8 ECHR absent compliance with
           the   Immigration   Rules   or    very    compelling/exceptional
           circumstances.  Had the overstaying Appellant returned to  India
           long ago and applied  for  entry  clearance,  sponsored  by  her
           partner in accordance with the Immigration Rules (as a fiancï¿½e),
           she might have returned to the United Kingdom lawfully  by  now.
           The judge was  entitled  to  find  that  family  life  could  be
           continued reasonably  in  India,  and  that  it  would  make  no
           difference to the child, particularly given the presence of  the
           Appellant's partner's family there, or that an  entry  clearance
           application could be made in due course to enable family life to
           be continued lawfully in the United Kingdom.  It was almost  too
           obvious for the  judge  to  have  stated  that  the  Appellant's
           partner could accompany her while entry clearance is sought, for
           some or part of that period.


       12. In conclusion, the tribunal finds that there was no error of law
           and the onwards appeal must be dismissed.








      DECISION


      The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.


      There was no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
      decision and reasons, which stands unchanged.
