                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Row, promulgated at Birmingham Sheldon Court on  7th  July  2015.
    In the determination, the judge dismissed the appeal of the  Appellant,
    who subsequently applied for, and was granted permission to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Somalia,  who  was  born  on  1st
    January 1958.  He  appeals  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State, dated 13th March 2015 to refuse his application for
    asylum and for humanitarian protection.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he fears persecution on  grounds  of  his
    race as a member of a minority clan in Somalia and that there is also a
    real risk of serious harm which he would face if  returned  to  Somalia
    because he is a member of the  Ashraf  minority  clan  which  has  been
    persecuted  since  the  outbreak  of  the  civil  war  in  1992.    The
    Appellant's claim is that he fled Mogadishu with  his  wife  and  three
    sons after their home was hit by mortar shell during  fighting  between
    militia.  Subsequently, in June 2008,  Al  Shabaab  militants  captured
    Ferfer where he had been  living  and  he  was  abducted  and  held  in
    captivity for three weeks and severely beaten.  His wife  and  children
    had gone missing.  In August 2011, he was contacted  by  his  daughter,
    Miss Yusuf, who was living in the United Kingdom and had  been  put  in
    touch with him by a member of the Somali community, who  had  seen  the
    Appellant in Kampala and had met the Appellant's  cousin,  Mr  Ibrahim,
    who had adopted that daughter.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge did not find the Appellant and his daughter in the UK  to  be
    at all credible.  He ruled that in matters concerning  the  Appellant's
    immigration status and his family and financial connections, it was not
    possible to rely upon anything that either of them said (see  paragraph
    57).  The judge held that the Appellant had told deliberate lies in his
    evidence (see paragraph 53).  As for the Appellant's membership of  the
    Ashraf clan, the guidance given officially was that clan structure  was
    not something which would either advantage  or  disadvantage  a  person
    returning to Mogadishu  (see  paragraph  64).   In  fact,  an  ordinary
    civilian, who is not associated with security forces, is  not  at  real
    risk of persecution or risk of harm such as to require protection under
    Article 3 of the ECHR.  The Appellant's claim under Article 8 was  also
    dismissed (see paragraphs 82 to 85).

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that the judge  failed  to  take  into
    account the Appellant's membership of a minority clan in his assessment
    of the risks to which the Appellant would be subjected if  he  returned
    to Somalia.  Furthermore the case of MOJ and  Others  (Somalia)  [2014]
    UKUT 00442 had not been faithfully applied.

 6. On 29th September 2015, permission to appeal was granted by  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that it was  entirely  arguable  that  the  judge
    failed to consider the significance of the Appellant's clan  membership
    (see paragraph 64) which was contrary to the findings in MOJ that  clan
    membership is still a relevant factor in  the  assessment  of  risk  on
    return.  Secondly, it was also arguable that the Appellant  would  have
    financial assistance from his daughter was a finding that was not  open
    to the judge because the judge failed to  take  into  account  relevant
    considerations in coming to this conclusion.

 7. On 5th November 2015, a Rule 24 response was entered to the effect that
    the judge had adequately considered all these and  had  given  adequate
    reasons.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on  12th  February  2016,  Ms  Alison  Pickup,
    appearing on behalf of the Appellant, handed up a copy of the MOJ  case
    and directed my attention to paragraph 337  of  the  determination  and
    paragraph 339 which made it clear that clan membership was not  without
    significance in matters of protection.  My attention was also drawn  to
    paragraph 407 and 408.  Ms Pickup submitted that the  Appellant  was  a
    member of a minority clan and he had no financial support  any  longer.
    Therefore, the following four issues were relevant.  First,  there  was
    an absence of nuclear family  or  close  relatives  available  to  him.
    Second, in the absence of the nuclear family there was no clan support.
    Third, there was an absence of the availability of financial  resources
    to him.  Fourth, there was the issue about  his  ability  to  secure  a
    livelihood, with no close relatives, and no meaningful clan  connection
    if he were to be returned.

 9. Ms Pickup then proceeded to develop two of these points in some detail.
     First, as far as clan membership was concerned she drew  my  attention
    to paragraph  64  and  paragraph  63,  with  the  former  containing  a
    statement that clan membership was not something that  either  excluded
    or included an advantage or disadvantage either way with respect  to  a
    member of the Ashraf tribe.  With respect  to  the  latter,  the  judge
    observes at paragraph 63 that there is no reason  to  suppose  that  an
    educated man would not get a job without requiring  the  assistance  of
    his clan.  Second, Ms Pickup drew my attention to the financial ability
    of the Appellant's daughter to support him.   The  daughter's  evidence
    had been that she was sending the  Appellant  100  dollars  per  month.
    However, this was earlier.  Her circumstances in the  UK  had  changed.
    The judge had no basis for concluding that there was no difference  now
    in her financial circumstances to what was previously the  case.   From
    2013 when she was granted entry clearance to come, she had �750  income
    and �300 expenses.  Previously she was a young  single  woman  with  no
    financial obligations.  However, of late she  had  since  October  2013
    given birth to her daughter and her total income  from  state  benefits
    was �620, and she was living in council accommodation, and had bills to
    pay, and was in no position to  actually  support  her  father  as  she
    previously did.  When the judge concluded  at  paragraph  74  that  the
    Appellant's daughter could call upon relatives, this was  a  conclusion
    without any evidential basis.  The judge was simply wrong  to  conclude
    (at paragraphs 67 to 68) that the  daughter's  circumstances  were  not
    "greatly different out of work than they were  when  she  was  working"
    because she now had a child of her own,  and  she  was  supporting  two
    people on �620, whereas her previous earnings of �750 were used just to
    support herself.

10. As far as Article 8 was concerned the judge had erred again because  he
    found at paragraph 85 that, "Any family life that exists  between  them
    is limited if it exists at all".  The judge simply has not resolved the
    issue as to whether or not family life existed.  The  only  reason  why
    the Appellant had been separated from his  daughter  between  2000  and
    2011 was on account of the shelling of their family home  in  Mogadishu
    during the civil war there.  If they were living apart  presently  (see
    paragraphs 82  to  83)  this  was  because  of  the  financial  reasons
    following the daughter's inability to  work  given  the  birth  of  her
    child.  Moreover, the Appellant had  relied  on  remittances  from  his
    daughter while living in Uganda between 2011 and 2013.   It  was  wrong
    for the judge to conclude that there were no "Special ... emotional  or
    other bond other than that that is normal  between  a  father  and  his
    adult daughter" (see paragraph 84).  Finally, the judge concluded  that
    any interference in the Appellant's private and family life in  the  UK
    was outweighed by the public  interest  and  is  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim of immigration control.  However, this did not take into
    account  the  fact  that  the  Appellant's  return  to  Somalia   would
    effectively rupture his relationship with his daughter because she  was
    the primary carer of a British citizen  child  and  she  would  not  be
    returning to Somalia with the Appellant.

11. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that the starting point had to be that
    the Appellant came to the UK with entry clearance in order to undertake
    a job.  He was educated enough to do  that.   The  suggestion  that  he
    would not be  able  to  get  employment  upon  return  to  Somalia  was
    therefore simply implausible.  The judge recognised (at  paragraph  58)
    that the Appellant was educated and had been a school inspector and  he
    was more than able to get a job.  The judge gave  proper  consideration
    to the Appellant's circumstances (see paragraph  62).   This  left  the
    question about the relevance of clan membership.  It is true  that  the
    judge does not factor in clan membership.  He states (at paragraph  64)
    that clan membership  would  neither  advantage  nor  disadvantage  the
    Appellant.  However, the country  guidance  case  of  MOJ  is  entirely
    consistent with this observation.  This  is  because  some  traits  are
    dominated by clan affiliations but other traits are not.  The  case  of
    MOJ makes it clear (at paragraph 352) that there is  no  discrimination
    on the basis of clan membership, but  clan  membership  may  separately
    assist a person.

12. Second, as far as  the  issue  of  remittances  was  concerned  by  the
    daughter, it was open to the judge to say  that  nothing  had  changed,
    because what the judge was referring to  was  not  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant's daughter was in receipt of state benefits and was therefore
    a needy person, but was referring to the fact that her position was  no
    different because she still receives about the same amount  of  income,
    and in  circumstances  where  the  Appellant  would  be  able  to  find
    employment, the support that the daughter would provide would not  have
    to be significant.

13. Third, and in any event, the judge was firm in its conclusion that  the
    two of them were unreliable witnesses.  This therefore made  any  error
    on his part an immaterial error  given  that  the  witnesses'  evidence
    could not be relied upon.

14. Fourth, as far as Article 8  was  concerned  the  judge  was  right  to
    conclude as he did because he had  already  taken  the  view  that  the
    Appellant would be in employment upon return to Somalia.  Moreover, the
    judge concluded (at paragraphs 84 to 85) that there was no family  life
    engaging Article 8, and  the  judge  was  correct  in  this  conclusion
    because the Appellant and his daughter were living  separate  lives  in
    the UK.  Therefore, what one was left  with  was  simply  the  "private
    life" and under Section 117B this had always  been  "precarious"  given
    the Appellant's status.  Therefore, the  Appellant  could  not  succeed
    under his "private life" rights either.

15. In reply Ms Pickup submitted that one could not realistically  maintain
    that the judge's conclusion (at paragraph 64) that the  guidance  given
    in MOJ is that the clan structure is not something which  would  either
    advantage or disadvantage a person, was without any significance to the
    outcome of the decision.  This is because MOJ makes it quite clear that
    access to employment is dependent upon  clan  membership  or  financial
    support.  The issue before this Tribunal was that of "materiality"  and
    plainly such a conclusion was material to the outcome of the case which
    could not be substantiated.  Second, paragraph  340  of  MOJ  makes  it
    quite clear that if one is less likely to get a job because of  a  lack
    of clan affiliation then this is  tantamount  to  discrimination.   MOJ
    makes it clear that job access depends upon a nuclear family and having
    clan membership.  The Appellant was a member  of  the  Ashraf  minority
    clan  and  the  objective  evidence  was  clear  that  he  would   face
    discrimination.

No Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.

17. First, this is a case where the judge has not found the  Appellant  and
    his daughter to be at all credible.  The Appellant, on the other  hand,
    as Mr Mills has submitted, entered the UK in order to take  employment.
    He is not simply an ordinary  civilian  from  Somalia.   He  is  highly
    educated and was, as  the  judge  himself  found,  a  person  who  held
    "important jobs in Somalia.  He was a head teacher at two schools.   He
    was a school inspector" (paragraph 58).  The statement by the judge  at
    paragraph 64 that clan structure is not something  which  would  either
    advantage or disadvantage a person returning to  Mogadishu  is  broadly
    correct if one looks at the general tenors of the judgment in MOJ.

18. In that country guidance case, it is  made  clear  that  in  Mogadishu,
    "There is no inter clan violence taking  place  and  no  real  risk  of
    serious discriminatory treatment being  experienced  on  the  basis  of
    clan" (see paragraph 337).  The determination does add that,  "That  is
    not to say that clan membership has no significance to those living  in
    Mogadishu" (paragraph 339).  The nub of the decision in MOJ is that  an
    ordinary civilian will face no  risk  of  ill-treatment  or  harm  upon
    return to Mogadishu.  However, a person who returns to Mogadishu  could
    after a period of absence look to his  nuclear  family  (see  paragraph
    407(f)).

19. What is significant about this country guidance case is  the  reference
    to the fact that there is now "The issue of the emerging importance  of
    the nuclear family rather than clan membership  alone"  (see  paragraph
    83).  In this regard the evidence before the MOJ  from  the  UNHCR  was
    that "The clan dynamics  in  combination  with  other  factors  are  an
    important element when considering  risk"  and  that  "Newcomers  would
    certainly attract adverse attention; including those  originating  from
    Mogadishu but have left a long time ago" (see paragraph 83).

20. However, all of this has to be read in the context of the  decision  in
    MOJ (at paragraph 407(h)) that in the absence of no nuclear  family  or
    close relatives there are eight considerations that  may  conjunctively
    be taken into account, and these  include  circumstances  in  Mogadishu
    before departure, availability of remittances from  abroad  (which  the
    judge found the Appellant to be able to avail himself of on account  of
    his daughter's situation), as well as  why  his  ability  to  fund  the
    journey to the west no longer enables an Appellant to secure  financial
    support on return.

21. The Tribunal went on to say that given the improving economic situation
    in Mogadishu it would be up to the Appellant to show why he would  "Not
    be able to access the economic opportunities that have been produced by
    the 'economic boom', especially as there is evidence to the effect that
    returnees are taking jobs at the expense of those who have  never  been
    away".

22. It is true that the Tribunal in MOJ  also  stated  (at  paragraph  408)
    that,

         "It will therefore, only be those with no clan  or  family  support
         who will not been in receipt of remittances from abroad and have no
         real prospect of securing access to  a  livelihood  on  return  who
         would face the prospect of living in  circumstances  falling  below
         that which is acceptable in humanitarian protection terms".

    However, the judge did find the Appellant to be a person who would have
    access to a livelihood.  Therefore, the decision reached by  the  judge
    was one that was entirely open to him on the facts of the  case  before
    him.

23. Second, there is the issue of Article 8 rights, but here the judge held
    that, "Any family left that exists between them is limited if it exists
    at all" (paragraph  85)  and  gave  his  reasons  for  so  stating  (at
    paragraphs 82 to 84).  Moreover, Section 117B of the 2002 Act makes  it
    clear that the Appellant's position was one that was "precarious",  and
    therefore the judge was entitled to come to the decision that he did.

24. Accordingly, notwithstanding Ms Pickup's valiant efforts to persuade me
    otherwise, and the submissions that were delivered in  a  measured  and
    careful way, I am not satisfied that the judge erred  in  reaching  his
    decision for the reasons I have given.
