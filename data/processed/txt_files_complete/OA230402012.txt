For the Appellant:     Mr M Steward, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Holt, of Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. In this appeal the Appellant is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and the Respondent  is  Mrs  Faiza  Iftikhar  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan born 7th October 1988. For ease of reference however  I  shall
    refer to the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  as  "the
    Respondent" and Mrs Iftikhar as "the Appellant".

 2. This is a review of the appeal  brought  against  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer Islamabad to refuse the Appellant entry clearance to the United
    Kingdom as a spouse to join her husband "the Sponsor" who is a  British
    citizen settled here.

History and Background

 3. The Appellant, a Pakistani national born  on  7th  October  1988,  made
    application for a visa to enable her to join the Sponsor, Qadeer  Abbas
    her husband, in the UK. That application was  refused  on  2nd  October
    2012.

 4. The refusal decision stated that the ECO was  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant had met all the eligibility requirements of Section E-ECP.3.1
    of the new Immigration Rules.

 5. The grounds of appeal which were detailed, raised human rights  grounds
    namely Article 8 ECHR. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Cox and in a reserved determination he dismissed the appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules but allowed it on human rights grounds.

 6. In coming to his decision he recorded that the  Sponsor  is  a  British
    citizen and that it had been  accepted  that  the  Sponsor  is  earning
    �15,210 from his employment at Express Tyres. The Sponsor  had  adduced
    evidence on behalf of the Appellant, that he had a  further  source  of
    income as a sole trader and that his share  of  the  profits  for  that
    employment amounted to �5,239 for the last financial  year.  Judge  Cox
    noted that the Appellant had not mentioned on the visa application form
    that the Sponsor had an additional source of income and  therefore  the
    specified evidence in relation to that income  had  not  been  provided
    when the application was made nor  more  importantly  at  the  date  of
    decision.

 7. The Judge therefore  correctly  dismissed  the  application  under  the
    Immigration Rules. However when considering  whether  the  Respondent's
    decision was disproportionate under Article 8 ECHR,  he  correctly  set
    out that he had to follow the step-by-step approach in Razgar.  However
    when assessing proportionality he analysed MM [2013] EWHC 1900 HCA  and
    said in paragraph 29 of his determination,

         "Although the decision is not binding on the Tribunal, I have found
         the Judge's reasoning very persuasive. Blake J is the President  of
         the Upper Tribunal and in a lengthy judgment he has  considered  in
         detail the  relevant  case  law.  I  adopt  his  reasoning  in  its
         entirety".

 8. Following on from that he said,

         "In respect of the present case, in my view it is not simply enough
         to say that  the  Appellant  can  reapply  so  as  to  justify  the
         interference with the Appellant and the Sponsor's  right  to  enjoy
         respect for their family life. The Appellant  has  already  paid  a
         significant fee (over �550) and  the  Respondent  took  over  three
         months to make a decision. I find that this is a significant period
         of time. Especially for a new married couple".

 9. The Respondent sought and was granted permission to appeal Judge  Cox's
    decision. Suffice to say  that  the  grounds  seeking  permission  were
    neatly summed up in paragraph 10 of the grounds which stated,

         "In consequence, the learned Judge engaged in what the Secretary of
         State submits  to  have  been  a  clear  example  of  impermissible
         judicial policy making. In so far as the Tribunal to  into  account
         the findings in MM it is submitted that they  fell  into  the  same
         legal error".

10. Permission to appeal to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Baker in these terms,

         "It is arguable that, having concluded that the Sponsor  earned  an
         annual income of �5,210, less than the specified  gross  income  at
         paragraph 18 of  the  determination  and  in  concluding  that  the
         decision to refuse entry clearance was disproportionate, relying on
         on MM [2013] EWHC 1900 High Court Admin and Mansoor [2011] EWHC 832
         (Admin), noting at paragraph  31  of  the  determination  that  the
         Appellant would not be living at or near a subsistence level as the
         Sponsor earned  significantly  more  that  the  minimum  wage,  his
         conclusions that there was a disproportionate interference with the
         Appellant and Sponsor's right to respect for their family life  was
         arguably was in error for the reasons stated in the grounds".

11. Thus the matter comes before me to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision involved an error of law and whether  the  decision
    needs to be remade.

The Hearing Before Me

12. I heard representations from both parties, Mr Steward on behalf of  the
    Respondent sought to rely  on  the  grounds  seeking  permission  which
    essentially state that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  fell  into  error
    because he relied on and followed "almost to the letter"  the  decision
    of the Administrative Court in the case of  MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900.  Mr
    Steward said that to do so meant that the Judge fell into error. MM  is
    not a binding decision in any event and the Appellant cannot  meet  the
    Immigration Rules.

13. As a result the First-tier Tribunal Judge fell into error because  when
    he cam to apply the proportionality test in Article 8 he did  not  give
    appropriate weight to the public interest as he ought to have done.  He
    did  not  direct  himself  appropriately  under  the  Razgar  test  and
    therefore the Article 8 assessment was  made  without  giving  adequate
    reasoning for his decision. He submitted I should overturn the  Judge's
    decision and remake the decision dismissing the appeal.

14. Mr Holt on behalf of the Appellant advanced that the  Judge's  approach
    was entirely correct. His reliance on MM was an entirely proper way  to
    treat this appeal.

15. The Judge had found that the  Appellant's  Sponsor  had  an  income  of
    around �15,200 and that  was  accepted  by  the  Respondent.  No  other
    factual element needs to be relied upon. The decision of the Respondent
    is disproportionate because the First-tier Tribunal Judge was  entitled
    to follow the reasoning in MM.

Has the Judge Erred?

16.  I am satisfied I can deal with this matter briefly. MM is not  binding
    on the Tribunal as the First-tier Tribunal Judge correctly  recognised.
    However  that  judgment  remains  in  force  unless  and  until  it  is
    overturned by the Court of Appeal.

17. In those circumstances it was open to the Judge to follow the  approach
    set out by Blake J in MM and to determine the case in the way  that  he
    did bearing in mind the  unchallenged  finding  that  the  Sponsor  had
    �15,200 income per year at his disposal.

18. The grounds seeking permission (which  curiously  appear  to  start  at
    ground 5) undoubtedly set out the issues  which  the  Respondent  takes
    with that judgment. No doubt these are the issues which will  be  aired
    before the Higher Courts. It is known that the  Respondent  has  sought
    and been granted leave to appeal the decision in MM  to  the  Court  of
    Appeal. A date has been set.  It would invidious for me to try and pre-
    empt what that Court will decide.

19. Accordingly so far as the matter before me is concerned the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal is upheld.

DECISION

20. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of  law.  I  do  not  set  aside  the
    decision.

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order, therefore I make
no such order.

Judge of the Upper Tribunal

Fee Award

The First-tier Tribunal, although it allowed the appeal made no  fee  award.
No application was made before me regarding a fee award and I see no  reason
to disturb the First-tier Tribunal's finding on that matter.
