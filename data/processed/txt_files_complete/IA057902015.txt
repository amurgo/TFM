                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge   Sweet   sitting   at   Richmond
    Magistrates' Court on 7  July  2015)  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal
    against the decision of an Immigration Officer  to  Counsel's  existing
    leave to enter the United Kingdom as a business visitor under paragraph
    321A of the Rules on the ground there had been  a  material  change  of
    circumstances  since  leave  was  given,  such  that  leave  should  be
    cancelled.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make   an   anonymity
    direction, and I do not consider that  the  appellant  requires  to  be
    accorded anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal

 2. On 28  October  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         "3.  The appellant sought leave to enter the UK on 29 January  2015
             as a business visitor. This was cancelled on 30  January  2015
             as  the  respondent  considered   that   the   appellant   has
             established a business in the UK without the requisite visa.

         4.   The respondent submits that there was the making of a material
             misdirection of law.  Firstly the failure to resolve  conflict
             in evidence:

             .    'In finding that  the  appellant  had  not  breached  his
                  business visa,  it  is  respectfully  submitted  that  the
                  tribunal have failed to resolve conflicts in the  evidence
                  about the appellant's business activities  in  the  UK  in
                  relation to IMPACT Corporation UK Ltd, as detailed in  the
                  respondent's explanatory statement  dated  5  April  2015'
                  points 1-5.

             .    'This amounts to a material error of  law  as  there  has
                  been a failure to  consider  and  resolve  the  points  of
                  concern raised by the  Secretary  of  State,  particularly
                  concerns that he had a UK driving licence issued on 03  11
                  12  registered  to  impact  Corporation's  UK  address,  a
                  business card in the same  company  name  showing  him  as
                  CEO/proprietor with a UK e-mail address, and  a  companies
                  house AP01 appointment of director  document  showing  his
                  country of residence as UK,  conflicting  evidence  as  to
                  whether  or  not  he  had  put  money  into  the  business
                  (including payment of �167,300 he received).'

         5.   Ground two-failure to provide adequate reasons on  a  material
             fact.

             .    'It is respectfully  submitted  that  the  tribunal  have
                  therefore failed to provide  any  reasons  other  findings
                  made at paragraph 12, that the appellant has not  breached
                  his business visa-especially as the appellant is  said  to
                  own 99% of the company's shares.  It is incumbent upon the
                  tribunal to explain why this  decision  has  been  reached
                  given  the  concerns  raised  by  the  respondent  in  the
                  explanatory statement of 5th April 2015.'

         6.   It may be argued that the decision was not sufficient to  meet
             the standards identified in the guidance  on  the  approach  a
             court should  take  to  the  reasons  given  by  a  specialist
             tribunal such as the FTT in R (Iran and others v. SSHD  [2015]
             EWCA Civ 982 and R  (Ashworth  Hospital  Authority)  v  Mental
             Health Review Tribunal [2001] EWHC 901 (Admin) at [77].   What
             is required is that the reasons must give sufficient detail to
             show the parties  and  the  appellate  tribunal  or  reviewing
             court, the principles upon which the lower tribunal has acted,
             and the reasons that led to its decision,  so  that  they  are
             able to understand why it reached its decision.   The  reasons
             need not be elaborate, and need not deal with  every  argument
             presented, however it may be argued in this case that a number
             of important issues raised by the  respondent  have  not  been
             satisfactorily decided upon by the tribunal.

         7.   It is arguable that the judge has misdirected himself for  the
             above  reasons  and  all  of  the  grounds  submitted  by  the
             respondent are arguable.  Permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
             Tribunal is granted."

Relevant Background

 3. The claimant is a national of India, whose date of  birth  is  12  July
    1956.  He has been a businessman since 1995.  He had been in possession
    of a business visitor visa since 2002 to enable him to  travel  to  the
    United Kingdom on business.  In 2012 he was issued with a 10 year multi-
    visit business visa.

 4. At the beginning of January 2015 he applied for entry  clearance  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).  In support of his application, he relied  inter
    alia on a letter from a firm of accountants  who  said  they  had  been
    acting as accountants for Impact Corporation UK Limited since 8 January
    2009.  They confirmed that the claimant had  been  a  creditor  of  the
    company since 2010, and that in the  course  of  a  three  year  period
    running from the tax year ending 2011 to  the  tax  year  ending  2014,
    payments totalling �167,300 had been made to him as a return of  credit
    owed to him by Impact Corporation UK Limited.  He now intended to  take
    over the company, and had  been  appointed  as  a  director  of  Impact
    Corporation UK Limited on  15  August  2014.   He  intended  to  invest
    �200,000 in the company in order to expand its business in the  UK  and
    the EU.

 5. On 29 January 2015 the claimant flew into the UK with the intention  of
    attending a meeting with the other director of the company to  finalise
    his takeover of the  business  and  to  be  briefed  by  two  potential
    clients.  He says he intended to remain for two days before  travelling
    on to the USA.  He had a 10 year business visit visa to the  USA  which
    had been issued to him in 2011.  On his arrival at Heathrow, he  showed
    the Immigration Officer his return ticket to India on 6 February 2015.

 6. The claimant's application for a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  visa  had  been
    refused a week before on 23 January 2015.  The visa was refused because
    the Entry Clearance Officer  was  satisfied  that  he  had  established
    business in the UK,  namely  Impact  Corporation  UK  Limited,  without
    getting the requisite visa for that purpose.

 7. The claimant was asked on his arrival whether he had ever been  refused
    a visa to the UK, and he answered that he had, referring to the refusal
    of his Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa.   This  led  to  his  baggage  being
    searched, and to two extensive interviews in which  he  was  questioned
    about his relationship with Impact Corporation UK Limited.

 8. On the same day, he was issued with a notice of  refusal  of  leave  to
    enter in the following terms:

         "On 23/7/12 you were given an entry clearance which had  effect  as
         leave to enter the United Kingdom as a Business Visitor  but  I  am
         satisfied that there has been such a  change  of  circumstances  in
         your case since he leave was granted that it should  be  cancelled.
         This is  because  you  obtained  a  business  visit  visa  to  meet
         customers and Mr Harish SHAH of New Florence collection for a 10 to
         12 day business visit.  However, since this  visa  was  issued  you
         have become a 99% shareholder in  MR  Harish  Shah's  business  and
         taken over this business under the umbrella of  IMPACT  Corporation
         UK LTD.  You have therefore established a business in the UK whilst
         on a Business visit visa.  Furthermore you applied  for  a  TIER  1
         Entrepreneur visa which was refused on 23/01/2015.  Your  visa  was
         refused because the Entry Clearance officer was satisfied that  you
         have established a business in the UK without getting the requisite
         visa for that purpose.  There were  also  concerns  that  you  have
         effectively been working in the UK on a business visit visa.

         I consider that this and all of the above constitutes a significant
         and material change of circumstances and that the  leave  conferred
         by your entry clearance should be cancelled.

         I therefore cancel your leave under Section 2A(8) of Schedule 2  of
         the Immigration Act 1971 and paragraph 321(A)(1) of the Immigration
         Rules (HC395)."

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-Tier Tribunal

 9. At the hearing before Judge Sweet, the claimant was represented  by  Mr
    Noor of Counsel, and there was no appearance on behalf of the Secretary
    of State.  The judge received oral evidence from the claimant.  Mr Noor
    relied on an extensive skeleton argument in which he advanced the  case
    that what his client had done in the past on  previous  visits  to  the
    United Kingdom, and what he was proposing to do on  his  latest  visit,
    did  not  breach  paragraph  46G  of  the  Rules  which  sets  out  the
    requirements for leave to enter as  a  business  visitor,  nor  was  it
    contrary to the published Home Office  guidance  on  business  visitors
    valid from 6 November 2014, all 45 pages of which  he  annexed  to  his
    skeleton argument.

10. In his witness statement, the claimant drew attention to the fact  that
    when refusing his Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  visa,  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer had acknowledged that establishing a business in the UK  whilst
    being present in the UK on a business visit visa was  not  specifically
    prohibited.

11. In his subsequent decision, the judge acknowledged that the Home Office
    bundle contained inter alia an explanatory  statement  dated  15  April
    2015, the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) refusal notice, information relating to
    Impact Corporation UK Limited, an HSBC bank  statement,  and  interview
    records.

12. He summarised the evidence which he received from the claimant.  He was
    not employed by Impact Corporation UK Limited.  He had never received a
    salary  or  dividends  from  that  company.   He  was  aware   of   the
    restrictions under the business visa and that he could not be  paid  or
    have access to public funds.  He had not breached the conditions of his
    business visa.  He was owed money by the UK company,  but  this  was  a
    repayment for credit which he had given to suppliers between  2009  and
    2014.

13. At paragraph [9]  the  judge  summarised  Counsel's  submissions.   The
    claimant had not breached the conditions of his visa.  He  could  be  a
    director and establish a company in the UK.

14. The judge set out his findings of fact  at  paragraphs  [10]  to  [13],
    which I reproduce verbatim below:

         "10. The burden of proof is on the Appellant and the civil standard
             of the balance of probabilities applies.  The Appellant was in
             receipt of a business visa since 2002 to enable him to  travel
             to the UK on business.  He made a visit on 29th January  2015,
             with a view to attending a meeting with another director of  a
             company to finalise the takeover of the  business  and  to  be
             briefed by two potential clients.  He wished to stay in the UK
             for two days before travelling to the USA, also  for  business
             reasons.  He was detained on  arrival  and  refused  leave  to
             enter the UK,  but  granted  temporary  admission  until  14th
             February 2015.  He was refused leave to enter on  the  grounds
             that there had been a change in his circumstances  since  2012
             when the visa had been issued.  It was  alleged  that  he  had
             established a business whilst on a business visit visa and  he
             had been working in the UK.  The  purpose  of  his  visit  was
             permitted under paragraph  46  of  the  Immigration  Rules  to
             arrange deals, negotiate or sign trade agreements or contracts
             and carry out a fact-finding mission.  He  is  the  proprietor
             and chief executive officer of Impact Corporation,  a  company
             based in Delhi, India, he has travelled to all  parts  of  the
             world in the past few years on business and  since  July  2002
             has been issued with three successful long term business visit
             visa from the UK.  He has visited the UK on many occasions and
             has  never  overstayed  his  visa  nor  breached  any  of  the
             conditions.

         11.  Impact Corporation UK Ltd was incorporated in the  UK  on  8th
             January 2009.  The company had, a  sole  director,  Mr  Harish
             Shah, who was responsible for the management of  the  company,
             99% of the shares belong to the Appellant and 1% to  Mr  Shah.
             On 15th August 2014 the Appellant was appointed a  co-director
             of Impact Corporation Ltd and it was  on  12th  December  2014
             that he made an application for a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  visa
             to enable him to undertake managerial work for the company  of
             the UK - but that application  was  refused  on  27th  January
             2015.   There  is  a  pending  judicial  review  against  that
             refusal.

         12.  The Appellant has never received any payment in  the  form  of
             dividends or cash or other pay from  Impact  Corporation,  nor
             has he done any work for the company since being appointed co-
             director on 15th August 2014."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

15. At the hearing in the Upper Tribunal to determine whether an  error  of
    law was made out,  Ms  Savage  relied  on  the  case  advanced  in  the
    permission application.  On behalf of the claimant, Mr  Noor  developed
    the Rule 24 response which had been served on the  Secretary  of  State
    and the Upper Tribunal.  I asked him about the refusal of  the  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) visa.  He said that the appellant had commenced judicial
    review proceedings,  which  had  recently  been  compromised  with  the
    Secretary of  State  agreeing  to  given  fresh  consideration  to  the
    appellant's application for a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant visa.

Discussion

16. The main reason advanced for cancelling the  claimant's  business  visa
    mirrors the main reason given for refusing the  claimant's  application
    for a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant visa, which is that he had  wrongly
    established the business in the UK in which he now proposed  to  invest
    the sum of �200,000.

17. The claimant's case is  that  his  historic  relationship  with  Impact
    Corporation UK Limited was that of a founding shareholder and creditor,
    and this was permitted under the Rules, as were the  preparatory  steps
    which he took in the late summer and autumn of  2014  with  a  view  to
    converting his status from that of a  business  visitor  to  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  The claimant recognised that, in order to take
    over the management of the UK  company,  he  needed  to  "upgrade"  his
    status from that of a business  visitor  to  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant.

18. Although not cited to me, I have had regard to Muse &  Others  v  Entry
    Clearance Officer [2012] EWCA Civ 10 on challenges to the adequacy of a
    judge's reasons.  In South Bucks District Council v Porter  (2)  [2004]
    UKHL 33, cited with approval by the Court of Appeal  at  paragraph  33,
    Lord Brown said:

         "The reasons for a decision must be intelligible and they  must  be
         adequate.  They must enable the reader to understand why the matter
         was decided as it was and what  conclusions  were  reached  on  the
         'principal important  controversial  issues',  disclosing  how  any
         issue of law or fact was resolved.  Reasons can be briefly  stated,
         the degree of particularity  required  depending  entirely  on  the
         nature of the issues falling for decision.  The reasoning must  not
         give rise to a substantial doubt as to whether the  decision  maker
         erred in law, for example, by misunderstanding some relevant policy
         or some other important matter or by failing to  reach  a  rational
         decision on relevant grounds.  But such adverse inference will  not
         readily be drawn.  The reasons need only refer to the  main  issues
         in the dispute, not to every material consideration."

19. Ground 1 is that the judge failed to resolve conflicts in the  evidence
    detailed in the Secretary of State's explanatory  statement,  and  thus
    failed to provide adequate reasons for finding that  the  claimant  had
    not breached his business visa, especially as the claimant was said  to
    own 99% of the company's shares.

20. The main issue raised by the explanatory statement was whether what the
    claimant agreed he had done in the past, such as  (a)  becoming  a  99%
    shareholder in the UK  company  and  (b)  in  August  2014  becoming  a
    director of the company, constituted a breach  of  his  business  visa.
    There was also a subsidiary  issue  as  to  whether,  contrary  to  his
    denial, the appellant  had  engaged  in  business  activity  which  was
    clearly prohibited by the conditions of  his  business  visa,  such  as
    being employed by the UK company.

21. Judge Sweet gave adequate reasons for resolving both  these  issues  in
    favour of the claimant.  It is true that he  did  not  refer  to  every
    piece of evidence relied on in the explanatory statement as reinforcing
    the suspicion that the appellant had breached  the  conditions  of  his
    business visa.  However, the judge was not required to do so, following
    Muse.

22. Furthermore, some of the specific concerns  raised  in  the  permission
    application are matters about which there was no factual dispute.   The
    claimant accepted that he owned 99% of the company's shares, as  indeed
    he had done since the company was formed.  He also accepted that he had
    been appointed as a director.

23. The other points of concern (the driving licence  allegedly  registered
    to the  company's  UK  address,  the  possession  of  a  business  card
    allegedly showing the claimant as the CEO/proprietor of the UK  company
    with a UK email address, and the Companies House document  showing  him
    as having a UK residence), were relevant  to  the  credibility  of  the
    claimant's denial that he had crossed the line by engaging in  activity
    in the UK which was prohibited by the Rules.

24. There is no specific challenge to  the  judge's  findings  of  fact  at
    paragraph [12] of his decision, and accordingly those particular points
    of concern melt  away.   Despite  (alleged)  outward  appearances,  the
    claimant had not engaged in impermissible activity.

25. I say "alleged" advisedly, as Mr Noor informed me in the course of oral
    argument that two  of  the  three  points  of  concern  were  factually
    incorrect.  The claimant's driving licence had not been  registered  to
    the UK company's address, but to a friend's address,  and  he  produced
    evidence of this for my inspection.  It was also not the case that  the
    claimant was in possession of a business card  in  respect  of  the  UK
    company.  His Indian company trades under the name Impact  Corporation,
    and the claimant's business card related to the business in India,  not
    the business which he proposed to take over in the  UK.   The  claimant
    agreed that it had been a mistake to register  himself  as  a  UK-based
    director, and the entry at Companies House has since been corrected.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
