                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Oakley promulgated on 1 October  2014  dismissing  the  appeal  of  the
    Appellant, Mr Mohammed Habeebudin, against a decision of the  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department dated 22 January  2014  to  refuse  to
    vary leave to remain and  to  remove  the  Appellant  from  the  United
    Kingdom.


Background

2.   The Appellant is a citizen of India born on  4  June  1979.   He  first
    entered the United Kingdom as a  student  and  was  thereafter  granted
    successive periods of further leave to remain as a Tier 4 Migrant,  and
    most recently as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant  from  30  December
    2011 until 30 December 2013.  Just prior to the expiry of his leave, on
    30 December 2013 he submitted  an  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur).  That  application  was,  as  is
    identified at paragraph 16 of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,
    made without the benefit of any  legal  advice.   The  application  was
    deficient in a number of material respects.

3.   The Respondent refused  the  application  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
    combined Notice of Immigration Decision and Reasons for Refusal  Letter
    dated 22 January 2014. This document is a matter of record and I do not
    propose to quote extensively from its  contents.   Suffice  to  say  it
    identifies the various defects in the Appellant's application  at  some
    considerable length. The application  was  refused  with  reference  to
    paragraph 245DD(b) of the Immigration  Rules.   In  the  circumstances,
    with reference to paragraphs 245DD(h) and (l), the Respondent  did  not
    carry out a detailed assessment of the Appellant's business proposal.

4.   The Appellant appealed to  the  IAC.   His  appeal  was  dismissed  for
    reasons set out in the determination of Judge Oakley.

5.   The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  which
    was granted on 19 November 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer.


Consideration

6.   Before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant placed reliance  upon  the
    provisions of paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules and argued  that
    the decision of the Secretary of State was not in accordance  with  the
    law because a request for further information and materials should have
    been made pursuant to paragraph 245AA in order to rectify  the  various
    defects that were identified in  the  combined  Notice  of  Immigration
    Decision and Reasons for Refusal Letter.

7.   In my judgement the reasoning  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in
    addressing  the  arguments  made  on  behalf  of   the   Appellant   is
    unsatisfactory in two respects.

8.   Under the heading "My Findings of Fact" the Judge does not set out  any
    particular findings, but rather merely rehearses the facts asserted  by
    the Appellant without stating in terms whether or not he accepts them.

9.   In considering the provisions of paragraph 245AA  the  Judge  says  the
    following at paragraphs 19 and 20:

         "There is provision contained in the Rules  under  paragraph  245AA
         for documents that are  not submitted with the  application  to  be
         requested but the wording of 245AA refers to certain documents that
         could be requested but Rule 245AA  does  not  envisage  that  if  a
         number of documents or details are  omitted  then  a  multi-faceted
         request should be made by the Respondent to  the  Appellant  merely
         because the  Appellant  has  failed  to  complete  the  application
         properly or provide all the relevant documents.


         Paragraph 245AA is  clearly  there  to  enable  the  Respondent  to
         request, for example, if one  bank  statement  is  missing  from  a
         series the missing document, or if  a  document  is  in  the  wrong
         format, for example if the letter is not on letterhead paper,  then
         requesting it in the correct format. Rule 245AA specifically  gives
         examples and uses the word "or" between each  of  the  clauses.  It
         does not envisage if a number of documents are missing  or  in  the
         wrong format then a request for corrections and replacements should
         be made."

10.  Paragraph 245AA does indeed draw a distinction between  documents  that
    have been submitted in support of an  application  but  are  considered
    defective for the purposes of the Rules by reason of being in the wrong
    format, or are copies rather than originals,  and  documents  that  are
    omitted  from  the  application  altogether.   There   is   a   further
    distinction recognised under paragraph 245AA between the omission of  a
    document, and the omissions of information from  a  document  that  has
    been submitted. Where a document has been omitted - rather  than  being
    defective in one of the ways specified in 245AA - it  is  only  in  the
    limited circumstances identified at 245AA(b)(i), "Some of the documents
    in a sequence have been omitted", that paragraph 245AA will be engaged.



11.  However, in my judgement  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reference  to  a
    "multi-faceted  request"  as  being  something  not   envisaged   under
    paragraph 245AA, lacks coherence and reasoning.  On  the  face  of  it,
    there is nothing in the wording of  paragraph  245AA  that  in  and  of
    itself excludes the Respondent from making a 'multi-faceted' request if
    each of a number of deficiencies engages the terms of paragraph  245AA.
    However, it appears that the Judge did indeed consider that where there
    are a number of deficiencies  the  Respondent  should  not  contact  an
    applicant to request the correct documents by reason of the  number  of
    such deficiencies alone - irrespective of  the  possibility  that  each
    such deficiency individually  would  have  justified  a  request  under
    paragraph 245AA.  If, as appears to be the case, that was the reasoning
    underlying the Judge's observations at paragraphs 19 and 20, then in my
    judgement such reasoning was in error of law.

12.  Be that as it may, however, the Judge identifies at paragraph 5 of  the
    determination that the decision of the Respondent was based in part  on
    the omission to submit documents, and in particular specified  evidence
    pursuant to paragraph 46-SD of Appendix A of the Rules.

13.  In setting out his conclusions the Judge also emphasises  the  omission
    of documents.  See for example at paragraph 22: "It is clear that  some
    of the documents submitted were either in the  wrong  format,  or  some
    were omitted...".


14.  In this context I note in  particular  the  following  feature  of  the
    Appellant's application and  appeal.   In  order  to  demonstrate  that
    �50,000 was available to be invested in his  business  in  the  UK  the
    Appellant relied upon a combination of money  held  by  himself,  money
    held by a third party, and money  already  invested  in  his  business.
    Paragraph 14 of the determination identifies this circumstance  in  the
    following terms:

         "[T]he Appellant states that  when  the  application  was  made  he
         relied on �18,438 available from a third party  and  �27,593.23  in
         his own account and �4,541.80 already  invested  in  his  business,
         which totalled  �50,629.53 and was  the  figure  contained  in  his
         business plan."

15.  I pause to observe that these  figures  are  not  readily  reconcilable
    with the information provided in the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  application
    form at Sections G10 and G11, in particular at Section  G11  where  the
    Appellant asserted that he had already invested �15,105.80.

16.  Be that as it may, in the Respondent's Reasons for  Refusal  Letter  it
    was  identified  that  the  Appellant  had  not  submitted   with   his
    application the documents specified under paragraph 46-SD of Appendix A
    to demonstrate the sum of money said to have been invested  already  in
    the business.

17.  Before me today it is acknowledged on behalf of  the  appellant  by  Mr
    Amgbah that it was indeed the case that the specified evidence had  not
    been submitted with the  application.   In  my  judgement  this  is  an
    omission of documents that is not in any way capable of 'rescue' by the
    provisions of paragraph 245AA, the omitted documents  not  being  of  a
    nature identified under any of subparagraphs 245AA(b)(i)-(iv).

18.  In the circumstances, even if there were something of substance to  the
    Appellant's arguments in respect of the  evidence  relating  to  thirty
    party support and the bank letters that he had been  able  to  provide,
    the circumstances were such that paragraph  245AA  did  not  cover  the
    omission of material documents to an extent that on the face of it  the
    Respondent's decision-maker was justified in declining to  request  any
    further documents pursuant to paragraph 245AA.

19.  In this context Ms Kenny also emphasised a further relevant omission  -
    as opposed to defect of format - by reference to  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41-SD(e)(v).  Whilst a suitable document from Companies House
    was submitted in the context of the appeal - see Appellant's bundle  at
    page 59 - such a document was not in fact created until 19 March  2014.
    Accordingly this was a further example of an omission  that  could  not
    have  been  remedied  pursuant  to  paragraph  245AA  at  the  date  of
    application or decision.

20.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge in concluding  his  determination  states
    this at paragraph 23:

         "I am satisfied that in those circumstances of the application  and
         the omitted documents that the Rules have not been complied with."

21.  It seems to me that that is a proper reflection  of  the  situation  in
    this case. The Appellant's application did not meet the requirements of
    the Rules; in so far as it was defective some such defects did not fall
    within the ambit of paragraph 245AA; this was sufficient to justify the
    decision-maker declining to request correct documents in respect of any
    deficiencies that might have fallen within the ambit of 245AA.

22.  I have  reminded  myself  of  the  provisions  of  section  12  of  the
    Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.  Whilst it seems to me that
    there is an error of law in the Judge's observations  and  comments  in
    respect of paragraph 245AA, by reference to  the  discretion  conferred
    under section 12(2)(a), in all the  circumstances  of  this  particular
    appeal I do not set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

23.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal accordingly stands.


Notice of Decision

24.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained no material error  of
law and stands.

25.  The appeal is dismissed.
