Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms K Reid, Counsel instructed by BMAP
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Albania.  Her date of birth is 1  January
    1965.  On 11 July 2016 she made an application  for  a  residence  card
    pursuant to the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006.
    The application was refused by the Respondent on 10 March 2017.

2.   It was not accepted  that  the  Appellant  received  regular  financial
    support from the Sponsor, her son, a citizen of Greece residing in  the
    UK. She claimed to receive ï¿½400.00 per month from him.  The  Respondent
    did not accept this.

3.   The Appellant appealed against the Respondent's  decision.  Her  appeal
    was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal (FTT) Judge M R Oliver on 20  June
    2018, following a hearing on 27 April 2018.  Permission was granted  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce on 26 December 2018. Thus, the  matter  came
    before me to decide whether the FTT erred.

The hearing before the FTT

4.   At the hearing the judge heard evidence from the Appellant who  adopted
    her witness statement  as  her  evidence-in-chief.   The  Appellant  is
    married to a Greek national. Her  sons  Sandri  and  Sajmon  are  Greek
    nationals.  They lived in Albania until 2003 when they moved to Greece.
    They resided together in Greece.  She was issued with a Greek residence
    permit whilst in Greece as the family member of her son.   Her  husband
    came to the UK in 2015. He became very ill. She and her son Sandri came
    here on 30 December 2015 to join her husband.  She  was  granted  entry
    clearance as a visitor for six months.  Sandri has been working in  the
    UK since March 2016.  She could not open a bank account because she had
    no leave here and because the Secretary of State had her passport.  She
    did not work and had no means to  support  herself.   Her  husband  has
    gangrene. He is unable to work.  They have a small  house  in  Albania.
    This is used to store furniture.  In Greece she and her husband worked.
    He cannot work here because of  his  poor  health.   The  family  lives
    together here. Sandri supports the Appellant. He gives  here  cash  and
    pays the household bills.  She does not work here and has no  means  of
    support other than that she receives from him.

5.   Sandri gave evidence adopting his witness statement as his evidence-in-
    chief. He confirmed that the family lives together and that he has been
    financially supporting his mother  since  they  moved  to  Greece  from
    Albania. This support continues. He is exercising treaty rights here in
    the UK.  In cross-examination he stated that his parents had their  own
    bank account in Greece.  He spent the first three months of his time in
    the UK looking after his father.  He is not aware how long  his  father
    will need medical treatment.  His family abandoned  the  property  they
    were renting in Greece.  Any possessions they have have  been  sent  to
    Albania to be stored in the family home there.

7.   The Appellant's daughter-in-law, Erjola, gave evidence and adopted  her
    witness statement as evidence-in-chief.

8.   At the hearing the Respondent did not challenge  that  the  Appellant's
    son was exercising treaty rights. The position of  the  Respondent  was
    that dependency was artificial.  It was argued that it was necessary to
    determine that a family member is dependent in the sense  of  being  in
    need of the assistance and Lim v ECO Manila [2015] EWCA  Civ  1383  was
    relied upon.  It was submitted  by  the  Presenting  Officer  that  the
    authorities clearly established that it  is  irrelevant  why  a  family
    member is dependent, but they  do  not  establish  that  dependency  is
    determined by the mere  fact  that  the  EU  national  makes  resources
    available to the dependent relative.  The critical question is  whether
    a family member is as a matter of fact in a position to support herself
    or not.  If she can support herself there is no dependency, even if she
    is given financial material support by the EU citizen.

The findings of the FTT

9.   The judge made the following findings at paragraph 13:-

         "I  find  that  the  circumstantial  picture   presented   of   the
         appellant's situation has been misleading and  contrived.   It  was
         even suggested that the appellant was dependent on her son when the
         family moved to Greece.  At that time her son was aged 10  and  she
         agreed in evidence that she had been working in Greece as  well  as
         her  husband.   I  have  been  given  no  information   about   the
         appellant's own financial circumstances or those of her  apparently
         ill husband.  I am told that the appellant not  only  has  resident
         status in Greece but also  her  own  property,  together  with  its
         furnishings, in Albania I find  that  the  evidence  of  all  three
         witnesses lacks credibility and that the moving of  some  bills  to
         the appellant's son was an  entirely  artificial  move  to  try  to
         create a cosmetic effect to enhance the application."

The Grounds of Appeal

10.  The grounds of appeal assert that  the  judge  erred  in  finding  that
    evidence was contrived. The authorities establish  that  dependency  of
    choice is still dependency within the Regulations. The  judge  did  not
    find that there was no evidence of dependency in this case, but  rather
    that it was contrived.  It was not in dispute that the Sponsor and  the
    Appellant were residing in the same household and the bills  and  costs
    of running the  household  were  being  met  by  the  Sponsor  and  the
    Appellant's other son.   The  judge's  reason  for  finding  dependency
    contrived was that prior to moving to the UK the Appellant was  working
    and able to support herself financially.  However, there  was  coherent
    evidence that the Appellant chose to move to the UK because her husband
    had fallen ill whilst here. The judge failed to properly consider this.
     Had the Appellant's husband not fallen ill they would have remained in
    Greece.

9.   In oral submissions, Ms Reid stated that  whilst  the  judge  may  have
    found that some of the evidence was contrived, it does  not  mean  that
    there was no dependency.  There was no evidence that the Appellant  had
    another source of income.  Whilst they have a house in  Albania,  there
    was no evidence of income  from  this  property.   They  had  supported
    themselves in  Greece  but  are  not  able  to  do  so  here.   It  was
    unchallenged that the Appellant's husband was too unwell to work and to
    return to Greece. It was not challenged  that  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband had worked in Greece and supported themselves  there  and  that
    neither was working here. What was challenged according to Ms Reid  was
    not dependency but whether there was a need for dependency.  Mr Lindsay
    stated that there was no challenge to the credibility findings  of  the
    judge.  There was no evidence about  the  Appellant  or  her  husband's
    financial circumstances.  His understanding of the decision is that the
    judge  did  not  accept  dependency.  Whilst  he  accepted   that   the
    Appellant's son was paying some of the bills, this  did  not  establish
    dependency.  The Appellant had failed to establish that  payments  were
    made to meet her essential needs.  She failed to establish  that  there
    were insufficient resources from elsewhere. The judge  did  not  accept
    that the witnesses were credible and did not accept the evidence.

The Case Law

10.  The relevant law relied on by the parties was  Lim  v  Entry  Clearance
    Officer Manila [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 where the Court of Appeal found  as
    follows in relation to the decision in Pedro v Secretary of  State  for
    Work and Pensions [2009] EWCA Civ 135 and Goldring LJ's observations in
    respect of dependency:-

         "I respectfully do not accept that these observations  of  Goldring
         LJ made good Upper Tribunal Judge Storey's conclusion.  Receipt  of
         support is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  It  is  still
         necessary to determine that a family member  is  dependent  in  the
         sense of being in  need  of  the  assistance.  I  accept  that  the
         authorities clearly establish that it is irrelevant why he  or  she
         is dependent, whether because  he  has  given  his  money  away  or
         because he is unwilling to work (save possibly where  an  abuse  of
         rights can be established), but paragraph  62  in  Pedro  does  not
         establish that dependency is determined by the mere fact  that  the
         EU national makes resources available to the dependent relative."

11.  The court went on to state at paragraph 32:-

         "In my judgment, the critical question is whether the  claimant  is
         in fact in a position to support himself  or  not,  and  Reyes  now
         makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view.  That is a simple matter
         of fact. If he can support himself, there is no dependency, even if
         he is given financial material support by  the  EU  citizen.  Those
         additional resources are not necessary to enable him  to  meet  his
         basic needs. If, on the other hand, he cannot support himself  from
         his own resources, the court will not ask why  that  is  the  case,
         save perhaps where there is an abuse of rights. The  fact  that  he
         chooses not to get a job and become self-supporting is  irrelevant.
         It follows that on the facts of this case, there was no dependency.
         The  Appellant  had  the  funds  to  support  herself.    She   was
         financially independent and did not need the  additional  resources
         for the purpose of meeting her basic needs."

12.  Mr Lindsay relied on Reyes  (EEA  Regs:  dependency)  [2013]  UKUT  314
    where the head note reads at paragraph 1:-

         "The mere fact that a person  is  in  the  United  Kingdom  without
         lawful permission to work does not mean that he or  she  is  to  be
         considered as meeting the test of dependency under the  Immigration
         (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006."

13.  Ms Reid drew my attention to paragraph 21 of that decision which  reads
    as follows:-

         "We dealt first with the third ground of challenge, which contended
         that the judge should have deduced  the  fact  of  the  Appellant's
         dependency (at least up  until  20  September  2011,  when  he  was
         granted permission to work) from his immigration status in  the  UK
         and the fact that until latterly he had no permission to work.   We
         saw no merit in this ground. As already highlighted, in EU law  the
         test of dependency is a purely factual test.  It is  not  dependent
         on a person's status under national legislation.  Whilst  the  fact
         that a person is  an  overstayer  without  permission  to  work  is
         clearly a very relevant matter when considering a  person's  actual
         circumstances, it does not of itself establish  that  he  is  in  a
         situation  of  dependence.   As  already   noted,   assessment   of
         dependency also involves looking at a person's circumstances  as  a
         whole and what is known about how their essential  needs  are  met.
         Here there may be a wide range of factors to consider.  The  matter
         of whether a person is physically and mentally able to work may  be
         relevant.  So may be the matter of whether a person has worked even
         if it is unlawful for them to  have  done  so:  the  phenomenon  of
         persons working in breach of conditions is  regrettably  still  all
         too common. Another factor, emphasised by the Court of  Justice  in
         Islam and Others (albeit in the different  context  of  OFMs  under
         Article 3.2) concerns  whether  the  need  for  the  dependency  is
         genuine.  It can happen that such persons have assets of their  own
         sufficient to cover all their essential needs.  On the other  hand,
         even if a person works in breach of conditions he or  she  may  not
         earn enough from employment to cover their essential needs."

Error of Law

14.  The way in which this case was presented before the FTT did not  assist
    the judge to understand the chronology  and  the  factual  matrix.  The
    witness statements are insufficiently  detailed.  It  is  not  entirely
    clear that those preparing the  Appellant's  case  were  aware  of  the
    material issues.  However, I conclude that the judge materially erred.

15.   The  judge  accepted  that  there  were  a  number  of  bills  in  the
    Appellant's son's  name.   They  included  utilities  and  rent.  I  am
    satisfied that the judge found some dependency, but he did not consider
    the extent of it.   It is not entirely  clear  what  he  meant  by  the
    picture having been "contrived."  If  the  judge  meant  by  this  that
    dependency was not real in the sense that the  Appellant  could  either
    work here or return to Greece and work, this was not a finding open  to
    him. If he meant that the evidence of dependency was not  real  because
    the Appellant failed to establish that she  did  not  have  alternative
    means, this is problematic  because  he  failed  to  consider  material
    matters.  Whilst I accept that there were  genuine  credibility  issues
    with the evidence, there was no suggestion by the Respondent  that  the
    Appellant or her husband were working here. There was no  challenge  to
    the fact that the family were living together here in the UK. There was
    no challenge to the husband being unwell and unable  to  work.  It  was
    accepted that there were significant outgoings in the  Sponsor's  name.
    There was no challenge at  the  hearing  to  the  Sponsor  working  and
    exercising treaty rights here.  Whilst  the  Appellant's  evidence  was
    that she had a home in Albania, it was never suggested that she had any
    income from this property, moreover income that was capable of  meeting
    any of her needs. There was no suggestion that the  property  could  be
    liquidated which would obviate the  need  for  dependency.   The  judge
    found that there was no information about the Appellant's own financial
    circumstances or those of her husband.  However,  it  is  difficult  to
    envisage what information he was  evidence  he  expected  to  see.  The
    Appellant was in some difficulty in that she was expected  to  prove  a
    negative; namely that she has no other source of income.   In  my  view
    the judge materially erred because he  failed  to  consider  the  whole
    picture. He attached weight to the circumstances pertaining before  the
    family came here, when the Appellant was working  without  appreciating
    the reason for the change in circumstances.

16.  For all the above reasons I set  aside  the  decision  to  dismiss  the
    Appellant's appeal.  Both parties agreed that I could go on and  remake
    the hearing without the  need  to  hear  further  evidence.  They  were
    satisfied that there was no need to  make  further  submissions  having
    addressed me in some detail in respect of the error of law issue.

Conclusions

17.  The Appellant has established on the balance of probabilities that  she
    is dependent on the support of her Sponsor  for  her  essential  needs.
    Whilst  she  exaggerated  her  evidence  before  the  FTT  relating  to
    dependency prior to coming to the UK, there is no  reason  to  conclude
    that evidence of dependency since her arrival here was  fabricated.   I
    appreciate that because  the  Appellant  is  unable  to  work  this  is
    insufficient to establish dependency; however, it is a matter which can
    be considered.   The Appellant's unchallenged evidence is that  she  is
    here in the UK because of her husband's ill-health and he is unable  to
    work.  I reasonably infer from this that he does not receive an income.
    It was not suggested otherwise  by  the  Respondent.   It  is  entirely
    credible that the Appellant has not been able to open  a  bank  account
    here in the UK and does not have documentary evidence to establish that
    she does not have an alternative source of  support.   I  am  satisfied
    that she does not have an  alternative  income.  The  evidence  of  the
    witnesses was consistent on this point.   I am satisfied  that  she  is
    dependent on the support given to her by the Sponsor which is necessary
    to pay for her basic essential needs in the absence of  another  source
    of income. There is evidence the Sponsor pays utilities  and  rent  and
    there is no reason to disbelieve that she is given cash by him, in  the
    light of the absence of income from alternative sources.

18.  I find on the evidence that was before the FTT that the  Appellant  has
    established dependency which is sufficient to discharge the  burden  of
    proof.  I go on and remake the appeal allowing the  Appellant's  appeal
    under the EEA Regulations.

19.  No anonymity direction is made.
