                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr P Nath a Senior Home Office presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr S Karim of counsel instructed by Malik Law Chambers


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant is the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
         ("the Secretary of State"). The respondent is a  citizen  of  Nepal
         who was born on 29 December 1988 ("the claimant"). The Secretary of
         State has been given permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of
         First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Colvin  ("the  FTTJ")  who  allowed  the
         claimant's appeal against the Secretary of State's  decision  of  9
         December 2013 to make a deportation order  against  him  under  the
         provisions of section 5 (1) of the Immigration Act 1971.


      2. The claimant was granted a settlement Visa to join his  parents  in
         the UK on 4 January 2007 and he arrived here on 11 September  2007.
         Between 23 February 2011 and 28 August 2013  the  claimant  had  15
         convictions covering 27 offences. 23  were  for  theft  or  related
         offences and 4 relating to police, courts  and  prisons.  The  last
         conviction was at East Kent Magistrates Court  on  28  August  2013
         when the claimant was convicted of theft and sentenced to  42  days
         imprisonment. He had stolen 18 bars of chocolate valued at  ï¿½22.19.
         On 17 September 2013 the appellant was served with  notice  of  his
         liability to deportation.


      3. The Secretary of State's reasons for the  decision  were  that  the
         claimant's deportation was conducive to the public good because  he
         was a persistent offender who showed a particular disregard for the
         law. It was considered that paragraph 398 (c)  of  the  Immigration
         Rules applied but 399 (a) and (b) relating to family life did  not.
         Paragraph 399A relating to private life did not apply.  There  were
         no  exceptional  circumstances  which  would  outweigh  the  public
         interest in having the claimant deported.


      4. The claimant appealed and the FTTJ heard his appeal on 22 September
         2014. Both parties were represented. The FTTJ heard  evidence  from
         the claimant, his father, his mother a brother and a sister.


      5. The  Presenting  Officer  appearing  for  the  Secretary  of  State
         accepted that the claimant's father's service  with  and  discharge
         from the Brigade  of  Gurkhas  put  him  in  the  category  of  the
         "historic injustice" to Gurkhas. Whilst this was a  weighty  matter
         it was submitted that  it  was  outweighed  in  this  case  by  the
         claimant being a persistent offender.


      6. The FTTJ recorded that most of the facts in the case  were  agreed.
         The claimant came to the UK from  Nepal  for  settlement  with  his
         family in 2007 when he was 19. His father had  been  discharged  in
         January 1997 after long service.  The  claimant's  criminal  record
         meant that he was properly described as a persistent offender.  The
         offences mainly related to theft to support his  heroin  addiction.
         He had been released  from  detention  three  weeks  prior  to  the
         hearing before the FTTJ.


      7. The FTTJ found that the claimant  came  within  the  provisions  of
         paragraph 398 (c) of the Rules and was liable to deportation on the
         grounds that this was conducive to the public good because he was a
         persistent offender who showed a particular disregard for the  law.
         Paragraph 396 of the Rules applied and there was a presumption that
         the public interest required his  deportation.  However,  paragraph
         399 (a) and (b) relating to family  life  did  not  apply  to  him.
         Paragraph 399A dealing with private life was not applicable because
         he had not been in the UK for at least 20 years and still had  ties
         to Nepal. He could not  bring  himself  within  the  exceptions  in
         section 117C of  the  Immigration  Act  2014  relating  to  foreign
         criminals.


      8. In these circumstances the FTTJ said that as the claimant could not
         bring himself within Article 8 under the  Rules  the  question  was
         whether there were "exceptional circumstances" such that the public
         interest was outweighed by other factors.


      9. The FTTJ found that the claimant had  always  formed  part  of  his
         parents' household both in Nepal and in the  UK  apart  from  short
         period spent in prison.  He  had  not  established  an  independent
         household and had been financially dependent  on  his  parents  and
         siblings apart from a couple of years during which  he  worked.  He
         had been addicted to drugs and was probably still in rehabilitation
         as it was only  a  few  weeks  since  he  had  been  released  from
         detention. Whilst there were plans for him to go and  live  with  a
         brother who was thought to have more influence over  him  this  had
         yet to happen.


     10. It was concluded that whilst family life did not  normally  subsist
         between parents and adult children the claimant  as  a  25-year-old
         who had always lived with his family and remained economically  and
         emotionally dependent on his parents and siblings did have a family
         life with them.


     11. The FTTJ placed considerable weight  on  the  "historic  injustice"
         attached to the family because of the claimant's  father's  service
         with the Brigade of Gurkhas. Even in the absence of direct evidence
         that they would have settled here earlier than they  did  the  FTTJ
         found that had it not been for the historic  injustice  the  family
         and the claimant would have settled in the UK  much  earlier.  This
         was not a point considered by the Secretary of State in the refusal
         letter. It was not a "trump card" but a factor  against  which  the
         claimant's criminal behaviour should be weighed.


     12. Most of the claimant's offending arose as  a  result  of  his  drug
         addiction. The FTTJ found that whilst the was  no  professional  or
         expert evidence as to the risk of reoffending using a common  sense
         approach  there  was  a  greater  chance  of  the  claimant   being
         rehabilitated with his family in this country rather  than  without
         them in Nepal. In the summary of her reasoning the FTTJ  said;  "In
         the absence of an historic injustice to this family this  may  well
         not weigh much in the balance when it comes to  the  weight  to  be
         attached to the public interest in foreign criminals been deported.
         However, it is precisely because of the historic injustice being in
         the balance that I have decided on the  facts  of  this  case  when
         considered cumulatively  that  the  appellant's  deportation  would
         result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  for  this  family  such
         that it would not be proportionate." The appeal was allowed Article
         8 human rights grounds.


     13. The Secretary of State applied for and was  granted  permission  to
         appeal to the Upper Tribunal. There are two grounds of appeal. Both
         submit that the FTTJ erred in law. The first argues that there is a
         material misdirection of  law  in  the  assessment  of  the  public
         interest. There is said to be only one passing reference to this in
         paragraph 30 and the assessment is unbalanced. The  second  submits
         that findings are based on speculation.  There  was  no  expert  or
         professional evidence to support the claimant's contentions  as  to
         the prospects of rehabilitation. The FTTJ  applied  "common  sense"
         rather than the law. The view  was  based  on  assertions  made  by
         members of the family who had previously  failed  to  exercise  any
         control over  the  claimant  during  the  course  of  his  criminal
         activities. He was an adult and there had been a  failure  to  take
         into account Kugathas v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
         [2003] EWCA Civ 31 principles.


     14. I heard submissions  from  both  representatives  and  reserved  my
         determination.


     15. In relation to the first ground of appeal  it  is  not  correct  to
         state that there is  only  one  passing  reference  to  the  public
         interest. This is  addressed  not  only  in  paragraph  30  but  in
         paragraphs 17, 18 and 23. It is clear that the FTTJ had the  public
         interest in mind throughout her reasoning. Whilst it  is  submitted
         that the assessment is "woefully unbalanced" neither in the grounds
         nor in Mr Nath's submissions has it been suggested  that  there  is
         any particular factor relevant to the  public  interest  which  the
         FTTJ failed to take into account. In reply to my question, Mr  Nath
         said that it  was  not  being  suggested  that  the  reasoning  was
         perverse. I find that there is no material misdirection of  law  in
         the assessment of the public interest. Looking at the assessment as
         a whole I find that it is not unbalanced.


     16. As to the second ground of appeal, it is common ground  that  there
         was no independent or professional evidence before the FTTJ dealing
         with the risk of reoffending. The FTTJ said  as  much.  I  find  no
         merit in  the  tentative  suggestion  that  the  FTTJ  should  have
         adjourned for this  to  be  obtained.  It  is  possible  that  such
         evidence could have been provided either by those representing  the
         appellant or by the Secretary of State. In  the  circumstances  the
         FTTJ had to deal with the appeal on the  evidence  and  as  it  was
         presented to her, as is made clear in paragraph 29. Understandably,
         Mr Nath did not press the suggestion that judges should not take  a
         common sense approach. The FTTJ made a  proper  assessment  of  the
         evidence  given  by  the  witnesses   which   took   into   account
         inconsistencies about members of the family living in Nepal. It  is
         clear that the FTTJ was aware that the family had not been able  to
         keep the appellant from his offending behaviour in the past but  it
         was open to her to come to the conclusion that as he had been  free
         from drugs for about 13 months whilst in detention and  during  the
         short period since his release there was a greater  chance  of  his
         being rehabilitated from drugs and therefore his criminal behaviour
         if he had the support of  his  immediate  family  in  this  country
         rather than in Nepal where he did not have close relatives.


     17. Mr Nath no submissions as to how Kugathas principles had  not  been
         followed. These require a  careful  assessment  of  the  facts  and
         circumstances of each case and on the facts of this  case  and  for
         the reasons given in paragraphs 25 and 26 I find that it  was  open
         to the FTTJ to conclude that the appellant did have a  family  life
         with members of his family in this country.


     18. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and can see no
         good reason to do so


     19. I find that the FTTJ made  a  balanced  assessment  of  the  public
         interest and the claimant's  particular  circumstances  reaching  a
         conclusion open to her on all the  evidence.  The  grounds  are  in
         essence  no  more  than  disagreements  with  conclusions  properly
         reached. There is no error of  law.  I  dismiss  the  Secretary  of
         State's appeal and uphold the determination.
