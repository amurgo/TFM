Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Nath
For the Respondent:    Mr A Otchie of Counsel (Old Square Chambers)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will  refer  to  the
    original appellant, a citizen of Ghana born on  6  July  1962,  as  the
    appellant herein.

2.   She appeals the decision of the Secretary of State on 2 March  2016  to
    refuse to issue her with a permanent residence card  on  the  basis  of
    retained rights following  her  divorce  under  Regulation  10  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

3.   The appellant's appeal came before a First-tier Judge on 26 July  2017.
     At that hearing the appellant was represented by Mr Otchie as she  was
    before me.  The Secretary of State was also represented by Counsel,  Mr
    Talachi.

4.   In the Secretary of State's decision  it  had  been  claimed  that  the
    appellant's marriage was one of convenience.

5.   The First-tier Judge records  the  following  concession  made  by  the
    Secretary of State by Counsel:

         "Mr Talachi on behalf of the respondent confirmed at the outset  of
         the hearing that the respondent was not pursing the suggestion that
         the  appellant  was  party  to  a  marriage  of  convenience  under
         Regulation 2 of the 2006 Regulations."

6.   The Judge refers to  the  appellant's  immigration  history.   She  had
    entered this country on 21 July 2003 on a visit  visa  and  overstayed.
    The Judge heard oral evidence from the appellant which he summarises as
    follows:

         "3.  The Appellant was married to [AA] on 6 Mach  2009.   [AA]  had
             been her friend from Ghana and moved to  The  Netherlands  and
             became a Dutch citizen.  They had a proxy  marriage  according
             to the customary practice of  Ghanaian  culture.   They  lived
             together after marriage when both she and [AA] worked and [AA]
             also  worked  as  a  self-employed  person.   The   Respondent
             recognised and accepted her proxy marriage to [AA] and she was
             issued with a Residence Card on 24 March 2011 valid  for  five
             years.


         4.   The marriage  was  a  troubled  one  in  which  the  Appellant
             suffered from domestic violence.  She travelled to Ghana on  5
             April 2003  for  seventeen  days  to  24  March  (?)  2013  as
             reflected in her passport.  She explained her difficulties  to
             [AA]'s parents in an attempt to resolve the situation but when
             she returned to the United Kingdom there  was  no  improvement
             and she initiated the dissolution of their customary marriage.
              The dissolution was registered in a high Court of Justice  in
             Accra, Ghana and the Appellant produced copies of the official
             documentation.  The Appellant produced evidence of [AA]'s HMRC
             employment record.  He works extensively in the United Kingdom
             and exercises Treaty rights and she maintained was  exercising
             Treaty rights at the time of their divorce in June 2014.   She
             thought it was possible that  [AA]  may  have  told  the  Home
             Office who was residing in The Netherlands and  no  longer  in
             the United Kingdom in July 2011 to attempt to frustrate her in
             her enjoyment of her ability to live in the United Kingdom  by
             virtue of her status as an EEA  dependant.   She  stated  that
             whilst he did make regular trips to The Netherlands they  were
             short in duration and he  maintained  home  and  work  in  the
             United Kingdom.  She maintained she had been married  to  [AA]
             for more than three years and he was exercising Treaty  rights
             at the time of their divorce and in any event she was a victim
             of domestic abuse.


         5.   In oral evidence, the Appellant stated that she  was  last  in
             contact with [AA] in 2016 and although in her passport she was
             allowed to travel anywhere in the EU, she stated she  did  not
             travel anywhere there and simply went back for one short  trip
             to Ghana.


         6.   In cross-examination, the Appellant stated that the last  time
             she saw [AA] was, she thought, in 2010 although later  thought
             it was possible it was 2012.  It was on that occasion that she
             obtained a copy of his passport although he kept the original.
              She did not know his whereabouts now and confirmed  that  she
             went to Ghana for about three weeks and spoke to  his  parents
             and it was a very difficult time She obtained  some  documents
             from her ex-husband via her solicitors who contacted him."

7.   Having correctly addressed himself on the burden and standard of  proof
    the Judge set out his findings as follows:

         "8.  I  found  the  Appellant  was  credible  in  relation  to  the
             background of her claim and accept that she has  been  married
             to her ex-husband for a period of  well  in  excess  of  three
             years between 2009 and June 2014.  In those circumstances,  it
             is unnecessary to make a finding that  she  has  also  been  a
             victim of domestic violence but having heard the  evidence  of
             the Appellant, I am satisfied that she  has  established  that
             she was such a victim.


         9.   In respect  of  the  documents  placed  before  me,  there  is
             evidence from HMRC in the  years  2010  to  2015  showing  the
             Appellant's ex-husband exercising Treaty rights by working  in
             the United Kingdom and the letter from  HMRC  dated  7  August
             2015 which I have no doubt is a  genuine  document  shows  his
             sources of income for the tax year  ending  5  April  2015  in
             respect of employment in the United Kingdom.  The  Appellant's
             ex-husband's P60 for the year ending 5  April  2015  has  also
             been produced as well as various payslips including one  close
             to the time of the divorce namely August 2015.


         10.  The financial documentation provided to the Appellant  by  her
             ex-husband is not complete but is of  considerable  assistance
             in my view in establishing  that  the  Appellant's  ex-husband
             was, indeed working  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  exercising
             Treaty rights at the time of the divorce.


         11.  In all the circumstances, I find the Appellant has established
             to the relevant standard that  she  was  married  to  her  ex-
             husband for over three years (or alternatively was a victim of
             domestic violence) and that her ex-husband, a Dutch  national,
             was exercising Treaty rights at the time  of  the  divorce  in
             June 2014."

8.   The Judge accordingly allowed the appeal.

9.   The Secretary of State applied for permission to  appeal  pointing  out
    that it was not exactly  clear  on  what  basis  the  appeal  had  been
    allowed.   The  application  had  been  made  for  permanent  right  of
    residence but the Judge appeared only to have considered Regulation 10.
     The Judge had erred in making only scant reference to the terms of the
    refusal letter.

10.  While the appellant had been issued a residence card on 24  March  2011
    this had been revoked on 7 December 2012 and no appeal had been  lodged
    against this decision.  The Judge had not engaged with this issue.   No
    reasons had been given for the conclusion that the appellant had been a
    victim of domestic violence.

11.  While the Judge had found at paragraph 10  of  his  determination  that
    the documentation provided had been incomplete he found it sufficed  to
    show that the appellant's husband had been exercising Treaty rights  at
    the point of divorce.  It was submitted that it was implicit  that  the
    Judge had not been satisfied that  the  appellant's  husband  had  been
    exercising Treaty rights for a continuous period of five  years  before
    the divorce while the couple were married in order for the appellant to
    qualify for a permanent  residence  card.   Furthermore  the  appellant
    needed to show under Regulation 10(6) that she had  been  a  worker  or
    self-employed person or a self-sufficient person from the date  of  the
    divorce.

12.  A First-tier Judge granted permission to appeal on 18 August 2017.

13.  A Rule 24 response was helpfully prepared on behalf  of  the  appellant
    and filed on 11 September 2017.  It was  submitted  that  although  the
    determination was concise it was clear that the appeal had been allowed
    because the appellant fulfilled the requirements  of  Regulation  10(5)
    and/or (6) of the EEA  Regulations.   The  determination  had  properly
    dealt with the substance of the refusal.  It was important to recognise
    that the Judge had had the benefit of a 276 page bundle of material  as
    well as the appellant's very detailed witness statement.  It was  clear
    that the Judge had accepted the appellant's evidence.

14.  On the issue of the revocation of the EEA residence card the  appellant
    had never seen any document that revoked that card and she  had  indeed
    used it to enter the UK after returning from Ghana in April 2013.   She
    had been let into the UK with no problems.  Counsel pointed out in  the
    response that the appellant's evidence was consistent with the material
    in the bundle.  There was an HMRC record of her continuing to  work  in
    the UK and a passport stamp indicating that she had left  Ghana  on  23
    April 2013.  Since the  evidence  had  not  been  contradicted  it  was
    entirely  logical  for  the  Judge  to  conclude  that  the   appellant
    ultimately could qualify under the provisions for  retained  rights  of
    residency.  Reference was made to Syed (curtailment of leave -  notice)
    [2013] UKUT 00144 (IAC) in which it had been held that the Secretary of
    State had to be able to prove  that  notice  of  a  decision  had  been
    communicated to the person concerned in order for it to be effective.

15.  On the issue of domestic violence there were sufficient details in  the
    appellant's witness statement for the Judge  to  accept  that  she  had
    indeed been a victim of  domestic  violence  and  could  qualify  under
    Regulation 10(5)(d)(iv) of the 2006 Regulations.  She had travelled  to
    Ghana to explain her  predicament  to  her  husband's  parents  without
    success and the marriage had subsequently been dissolved by proxy.

16.  The concession by experienced Counsel had been  properly  made  in  the
    light of the volume of evidence before the First-tier Judge.

17.  While the financial documentation of  the  appellant's  former  husband
    was not complete it established  that  he  had  continued  to  exercise
    Treaty rights in the UK and reference was made to the  HMRC  record  in
    the bundle.

18.  Mr Nath relied on the grounds of appeal and referred to  the  issue  of
    the concession.  On this point I referred the  representatives  to  the
    Judge's notes of the hearing where it was recorded at the  outset  that
    "marriage of convenience not pursued".  Mr Nath also submitted that  no
    findings had been made about the  question  of  domestic  violence  and
    there was very little evidence to support such a claim.

19.  Mr Otchie relied on the Rule 24 response.  There  clearly  had  been  a
    concession at the hearing.  There was a wealth of documentary  evidence
    before the First-tier Judge and  this  had  been  referred  to  in  the
    skeleton argument prepared for that hearing.  In this bundle there were
    HMRC records in respect of both the appellant and her  former  husband.
    Counsel referred in particular in respect of the appellant to pages  72
    and 73 of the bundle detailing the appellant's employment history  from
    2011 to  the  tax  year  ending  5  April  2015.   In  respect  of  the
    appellant's former husband while the record was not absolutely complete
    Counsel was able to identify material and pay slips for  the  tax  year
    ending in April 2015.  In paragraphs 15 and 16 of her witness statement
    the  appellant  had  confirmed  that  her  former  husband  had  worked
    extensively in the UK and had  exercised  his  Treaty  rights  in  this
    country as was apparent from the documentation and while  he  had  made
    regular trips to the Netherlands these had been of short  duration  and
    he had maintained a home and his work in the UK.   I  was  referred  to
    council tax records in the bundle where  both  appellants  were  named.
    There was also a tenancy agreement.

20.  While the determination  had  been  succinct  it  had  dealt  with  the
    relevant issues given the concession.  It was important to record  that
    the Judge had found the appellant to be a credible  witness.   She  had
    clearly suffered domestic violence and had  returned  to  Ghana  in  an
    effort to improve matters.

21.  In response Mr Nath pointed out that the Judge had  accepted  that  the
    financial material was not complete.  The issue  of  domestic  violence
    had not been properly analysed.   There  was  nothing  apart  from  the
    appellant's witness statement.  The matter had not been reported to the
    police.  The Judge had  erred  in  relying  on  incomplete  documentary
    material.

22.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the determination of  the  First-
    tier Judge if it was materially flawed in law.

23.  It is important to record at the outset that the First-tier  Judge  had
    the benefit  of  a  considerable  amount  of  material  before  him-the
    representatives had prepared a lengthy bundle  as  well  as  a  witness
    statement from the appellant.  Counsel then acting for the Secretary of
    State would  have  perused  this  material  and  it  is  clear  that  a
    concession was made at the outset of the hearing  as  recorded  by  the
    First-tier Judge both in the note and in his determination.  I have  no
    doubt that the concession was properly made  and  that  the  First-tier
    Judge was entitled to rely upon it. It would not be right to permit the
    Secretary of State to resile from such a concession made by experienced
    Counsel.

24.  In respect of the employment history the Judge states  in  paragraph  3
    of his decision that following the  proxy  marriage  the  couple  lived
    together when both she and her former husband worked.  In  paragraph  4
    the  Judge  refers  to  the  evidence  of  her  former  husband's  HMRC
    employment record.  He  recorded  the  evidence  that  the  appellant's
    husband worked extensively in the United Kingdom and  exercised  Treaty
    rights and was exercising such rights at the time of the  divorce.   It
    is important to record that the appellant's evidence  would  have  been
    subject to cross-examination and the Judge refers to the points put  to
    the appellant in paragraph  6  of  his  decision.   It  was  argued  in
    paragraph 5 of the grounds of appeal that it must be implicit that  the
    Judge was not satisfied that the appellant's former  husband  had  been
    exercising Treaty rights for a continuous period of five  years  before
    the divorce.  That does not follow.  The Judge found the  appellant  to
    be a credible witness and she had given evidence  she  and  her  former
    husband had lived together after marriage and that  both  she  and  her
    husband had worked.  There was extensive  material  from  HMRC  in  the
    bundle to which the Judge makes reference.   This  covered  the  period
    2010 to 2015.  It was necessary to make a finding about  the  situation
    at the date of the divorce and that was all that the Judge was doing in
    referring to the material indicating the position at that time.

25.  In relation to the issue of domestic violence it was not necessary  for
    the Judge in the light of his findings on the primary case advanced  by
    the appellant to deal with the issue as fully  as  he  might  otherwise
    have done.  He accepted the evidence that the appellant had been  in  a
    troubled marriage and had  suffered  from  domestic  violence  and  had
    attempted to resolve the situation by travelling to Ghana.  It was open
    to the Judge to accept what he had been told but as I have  said,  this
    was an alternative to his conclusion on the central point.   The  Judge
    did  not  make  express  reference  to  Regulation  10(6)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.  In paragraph 6 of the grounds of appeal it was said  that
    evidence needed to be provided that since the date of the  divorce  the
    appellant had been a  worker  or  a  self-employed  or  self-sufficient
    person.  It may be that this point was not expressly placed in issue by
    Counsel then acting for the Secretary of State  in  the  light  of  the
    extensive  documentary  evidence  provided.   The  Judge  accepted  the
    appellant's evidence unreservedly.  The appellant had said in paragraph
    14 of her witness statement that she had continued to work in the UK on
    the strength of her EEA residence card, paying her taxes  and  national
    insurance contributions and relied on her  supporting  bundle.  On  the
    issue of the purported revocation of the residence card, notice had not
    been given as required - see Syed referred to at  paragraph  14  above.
    The Judge sensibly relied on the salient issues identified  by  Counsel
    appearing for both sides and while his determination  is  short  it  is
    none the worse for that.

26.  Accordingly, having given careful attention to the points  advanced  by
    Mr Nath, I find that the determination of the First-tier Judge  is  not
    flawed by a material error of law and direct that it shall stand.

Anonymity Order

27.  The First-tier Judge made no anonymity direction and I make none.

Fee Award

28.  The First-tier Judge made a fee award in the sum of  �140  which  I  do
    not disturb.
