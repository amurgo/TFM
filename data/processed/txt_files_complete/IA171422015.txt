                                   Between

               the Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                TAMINA Rasul
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State appeals in this case against a determination  of
    designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Garratt  who   in   a
    determination promulgated on  17  Mach  2016  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal against the refusal of leave to remain on the basis that she was
    a British citizen.

 2.     It is accepted by the respondent in a  letter  from  her  solicitors
    dated 7 June  2017  that  that  decision  was  wrong.  The  appellant's
    solicitors are correct in their analysis of the  law.  And  correct  to
    follow the judgment of the Judge in the Hight  Court  who    considered
    the appellant's sister's appeal. I therefore set aside the decision  of
    the First-tier Judge.

3.     I am requested to remit the appeal for a hearing afresh in the First-
    tier.  That is the appropriate course of action as the guidance in  the
    Senior  President  of  tribunal's  Practice  Directions  are  met.    I
    therefore remit the appeal for a hearing afresh in the First-tier.

Decision


   1. The decision of the Judge in the First-tier is set aside.


   2. The appeal will proceed to a  hearing  afresh  in  the  First-tier  at
      Bennett House, Stoke.


Signed        [pic]                     Date: 13 June 2017
