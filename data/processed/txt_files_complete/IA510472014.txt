Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Biggs, instructed by Universal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Respondent in this case  was  the  Appellant  before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal and the Appellant the Respondent. For ease of reference I  refer
   to them as the Claimant and Secretary of State respectively.

2. The Claimant applied on 4 March 2013 for leave to remain  in  the  United
   Kingdom as the spouse of Aleya Khatun. His appeal against  that  decision
   was promulgated on 22 July 2014 and was allowed to the extent that it was
   remitted to the Secretary of State on  the  basis  that  it  was  not  in
   accordance  with  the  law.  The  Secretary  of  State  reconsidered  the
   application and re-refused it on 28 November 2014. The Secretary of State
   concluded that the Claimant did not meet the requirements of the  partner
   route because the suitability and financial requirements  were  not  met.
   The Secretary of State also concluded that the Claimant  could  not  meet
   the requirements of paragraph  276  ADE  (1)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
   because he did not meet the requirements with regard to length residence.
   A decision was made to refuse to vary leave to remain and to  remove  the
   Claimant under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality  Act
   2006.


3. The Claimant appealed against that decision to the  First-tier  Tribunal.
   First-tier Tribunal Judge Lawrence  allowed  his  appeal  in  a  decision
   promulgated on  24  July  2015.  He  found  that  the  Claimant  met  the
   suitability and financial requirements  of  the  Rules  and  allowed  the
   appeal under Appendix FM.


4. The Respondent sought permission to appeal against the  decision  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal. The grounds assert firstly that the Judge had  erred
   in finding that the income threshold was met. It is asserted  that  there
   was no appraisal of the evidence and the Judge based his findings on  the
   Claimant's application form. It is said that the  Judge  failed  to  have
   regard to the specified  evidence  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  and
   therefore erred in finding that the financial requirements were met.  The
   grounds also assert that the Judge failed to give  adequate  reasons  for
   findings on a material matter. The Judge found that the Claimant ought to
   have informed the Secretary of State that the restaurant which  sponsored
   his Tier 2 Migrant application had closed down and that  he  was  seeking
   employment elsewhere. The Judge found that he did not enter  the  UK  for
   the purpose of marriage  and  that  no  deception  was  employed.  It  is
   asserted that he did not adequately reason  this  in  the  light  of  his
   finding regarding the  closure  of  the  restaurant  and  the  Claimant's
   failure to inform the Home Office of his situation.  Furthermore  he  was
   issued a Tier 2 visa in March 2010 and had not worked and it is  asserted
   that it was not credible that  he  would  have  not  been  able  to  find
   alternative employment in time. The  Judge  is  said  to  have  erred  in
   failing to consider  this  aspect  of  the  Claimant's  circumstances  in
   relation to his finding on deception.


5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert  on
   28 October 2015. He concluded that  the  brief  content  and  absence  of
   reasoning in relation to the financial requirements  of  the  Rule  meant
   that there was an arguable error of  law.  He  also  concluded  that  the
   findings that the Claimant entered as a work permit holder  and  knew  he
   had a duty to inform the Secretary  of  State  that  the  restaurant  had
   closed down was arguably at odds with the finding in paragraph 7 that  he
   had not employed deception as far as his intention to work was concerned.



The Hearing

   6. Mr Kotas argued that the reasoning in the determination of the  First-
      tier Tribunal was woefully inadequate. With regard to the  suitability
      requirements, it was not only the fact that he entered in order to get
      married but he could not conform with his conditions of leave.


   7. The second and more troubling point was in relation to  the  financial
      requirement. The Claimant was required to demonstrate that he met  the
      requirements of the Rule by way of specified evidence. The  Judge  had
      made no findings whatever. What was even more troubling was  that  the
      Judge found that the sponsor was earning as claimed. In the  Secretary
      of State's bundle was evidence from HMRC which was not  engaged  with.
      The findings on financial requirement were not sustainable at all.

   8. Mr Biggs said that this was a reasons challenge. If those errors  were
      material he was forced to accept that the reasoning was  brief  if  it
      was there at all. As he understood there were two points; firstly  the
      issue concerning intention  and  secondly  the  financial  requirement
      points. The Judge was well-aware of the  points  with  regard  to  the
      intention and that was clear from paragraph 1  of  the  decision.  The
      Judge went on to conclude that the allegation was not  sustained.  The
      Secretary of State did not attend the hearing and there was no  cross-
      examination of the Claimant.   The  Claimant  stated  in  his  witness
      statement that he worked for some three months and then was  asked  to
      leave. The evidence was untested and the Judge was entitled to come to
      the conclusion that he did not  come  here  in  order  to  marry.  The
      Secretary of State had made a positive  allegation  of  deception  and
      that needed to be proved. There was no cross-examination  and  it  was
      bound to fail. For those reasons there was no material error of law.

   9. With regard to the financial requirements he referred me to page 46 of
      the Respondent's bundle. During the tax year,  the  Claimant's  spouse
      did meet the threshold and her income took  her  over  the  threshold.
      There were payslips and P60s to address the  evidential  requirements.
      There was no letter from the employer. However, even if he  failed  to
      go  through  mechanical  requirements,  the  Claimant   met   relevant
      financial threshold. There was no authority to state  that  First-tier
      Tribunal should apply the requirements of Appendix FM-SE mechanically.
      It was open to him to find that  the  threshold  was  met.  One  would
      expect to see some reasoning. The submission was that there was  ample
      evidence to show the threshold  had  been  crossed  and  it  would  be
      academic  to  find  there  was  an  error  of  law.  The   substantive
      requirements were satisfied and  the  decision  was  disproportionate.
      There was no material error.

  10. In reply Mr Kotas referred to SS Congo and what was said in that  case
      about the evidential requirements of Appendix FM. If you were  granted
      leave to enter and then did something else you were not in  compliance
      with the conditions of leave. There were  no  findings  on  that.   Mr
      Biggs submitted that it was not pleaded in the grounds.

  11. I indicated that I considered that the  reasoning  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal  was  clearly  inadequate  in  respect   of   the   financial
      requirements but asked for submissions on whether it was  material  to
      the outcome and whether there was sufficient evidence before the First-
      tier Tribunal to conclude that the Claimant met  the  requirements  of
      Appendix FM-SE. Mr Biggs said that the only material that was required
      was a letter  from  employer  and  sufficient  evidence  in  terms  of
      payslips. There was the document from page 46 and bank statements from
      item 13 onwards with regard to the sponsor's earnings. In terms of the
      requirement of a letter from the employer there was no letter  in  the
      Claimant's bundle. However at item H in the Respondent's bundle  there
      was evidence.


  12. Mr Kotas submitted that the evidence had to be compliant with the date
      of application, namely 6 months back from  March  2013.  In  terms  of
      letters from the employer in relation  to  H1  and  H2  there  was  no
      compliance. There were two letters from employer regarding  length  of
      employment. Neither of the letters stated what the  annual  wage  was,
      and the reality was that the sponsor was paid in cash and the payments
      showing in her bank statements didn't correspond with the  pay  slips.
      It had to correspond.


  13. Mr Biggs submitted that with regard to materiality, the  documents  in
      the Respondent's bundle covered the relevant six month period and were
      consistent with the document. He didn't accept  the  criticism.  There
      was a gross salary of �32,000. It was impossible  that  error  of  law
      would have made a difference.


  14. In view of the fact that the arguments on the materiality of the error
      related to documentation before the First-tier Tribunal, I  asked  for
      written references to that  evidence  from  both  representatives  and
      submissions as to how it met or did not meet the Rules. Mr Biggs  said
      he would be able to so by way of a  computerised  schedule  but  would
      require time. Both parties agreed that this could be done  by  way  of
      written evidence and  hence  I  gave  directions  for  the  filing  of
      evidence to address the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE with
      regard to the earnings threshold.

Discussion and Findings
  15. The grounds assert that the First-tier Tribunal's findings in  respect
      of the suitability requirements of the Rules are inadequately reasoned
      and unsustainable. The Respondent did not attend  the  hearing  before
      the First-tier Tribunal. The Respondent's case, as set out in the RFRL
      was that since the Claimant had not worked in the restaurant where  he
      had been granted entry clearance to work he had obtained a Tier 2 visa
      to facilitate his entry to the UK and  switch  to  into  the  marriage
      category.


  16. The First-tier Tribunal was clearly aware  that  of  the  Respondent's
      case in this regard as it is set out at paragraph 1 of  the  decision.
      He  correctly  directed  himself  that  he  needed  to  determine  the
      suitability point first. The First-tier Tribunal  made  the  following
      findings at paragraph 7:


          I do not find that the appellant entered the UK for the purpose of
          marriage and not to work. I do not find he deployed any  deception
          in this regard. I do find, on the  evidence  before  me,  that  he
          entered the UK to work. The marriage situation developed whilst he
          was in the UK.


  17. The First-tier Tribunal gave no reasons for these findings. Whilst the
      burden of proving deception was on the Respondent,  there  is  a  long
      established judicial duty to provide a reasoned decision.  The  First-
      tier Tribunal gave no reasons  for  why  he  accepted  the  Claimant's
      evidence that he did not enter the UK for  the  purpose  of  marriage.
      The matter was in issue  and  it  was  incumbent  on  him  to  provide
      reasons, however brief. He did not do so and that was a material error
      of law.


  18. The First-tier Tribunal found, at paragraph 8 of  the  decision,  that
      the Claimant met the financial requirements  in  Appendix  FM  of  the
      Immigration Rules because the sponsor had two  jobs  which,  when  the
      gross income from  both  was  added  together,  exceeded  the  �18,600
      required by Appendix FM in spousal applications.  In  coming  to  this
      conclusion, the First-tier Tribunal referred to a  schedule  which  he
      had asked the Claimant's representative to prepare at the hearing.


  19. There is no reference in the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
      Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules. The Claimant was required  to
      provide specified evidence of a specified gross annual  income  of  at
      least �18,600 (section E-LTRP.3.1).  According  to  paragraph  A.1  of
      Appendix FM-SE in order  to  meet  the  financial  requirements  under
      paragraph E-LTRP.3.1 the  applicant  must  meet  the  requirements  of
      Appendix FM-SE as to the permitted sources of income and savings;  the
      time periods and permitted combinations applicable to  each  permitted
      source relied on and the evidence required for each  permitted  source
      relied on.


  20. In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where paragraph  9
      applies), all of the following evidence must be provided:


       (a) Payslips covering:
       (i) a period of 6 months prior to the date  of  application  if  the
       person has been employed by their current employer for  at  least  6
       months (and where paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix does not  apply);
       or
       (ii) any period of salaried employment in the period  of  12  months
       prior to the date of application if the person has been employed  by
       their current employer for less than 6 months (or at least 6  months
       but the person does not rely on paragraph 13(a) of  this  Appendix),
       or in the financial year(s) relied upon by a self-employed person.


       (b) A letter  from  the  employer(s)  who  issued  the  payslips  at
       paragraph 2(a) confirming:
       (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;
       (ii) the length of their employment;
       (iii) the period over which they have been or were paid the level of
       salary relied upon in the application; and
       (iv) the type  of  employment  (permanent,  fixed-term  contract  or
       agency).


       (c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period(s)  as
       the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that  the  salary  has  been
       paid into an account in the name of the person or in the name of the
       person and their partner jointly.

  21.  I  have  had  regard   to   the   submissions/schedules   from   both
      representatives for  which  I  am  grateful.  The  Claimant  made  his
      application on 4 March 2013 and  was  therefore  required  to  produce
      payslips for the preceding 6 months.  He  relied  on  two  sources  of
      employment.  Whilst  he  produced  payslips  from  both  sources  from
      September 2012 to February 2013  and  bank  statements  for  the  same
      period, the receipts in the bank statements do not correspond with the
      amounts shown on the payslips. The deposits into the account  also  do
      not show the salary being paid into the account.


  22. Mr Kotas argues in his  written  submissions  that  the  Claimant  has
      therefore not complied with the requirements of Appendix FM-SE and had
      the First-tier  Tribunal  properly  considered  the  application  with
      reference to the specified evidence, he would be  bound  to  find  the
      Claimant failed with regard to the evidential requirements of Appendix
      FM-SE. It is submitted that for those reasons he did materially  error
      in law.


  23. Mr Biggs in his written submissions argues that  whilst  the  Claimant
      has difficulty in showing that the account  statements  correspond  to
      the same period as he payslips, it is nonetheless clear  that  on  the
      basis of the evidence relating to the Claimant's income, no reasonable
      First-tier Tribunal Judge could conclude that  the  Claimant  was  not
      earning the sums for the required period.


  24. Mr Kotas also argues that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  take
      account of evidence from HMRC at  'P'  and  'Q'  of  the  Respondent's
      bundle which showed that for the tax year 2012 to 2013 the  Claimant's
      spouse was paid �5529.20 by Upoher and �7583.38 by One  Stop  Business
      Solutions Ltd. This was a matter raised in the Refusal Letter.


  25. It is clear that the First-tier Tribunal misdirected itself in failing
      to apply and make findings on the provisions of  Appendix  FM-SE.  The
      Rules require that the bank statements show that the  salary  is  paid
      into the bank account. As the amounts paid into the bank statements in
      this case do not correlate to the salary on the payslips I  find  that
      it cannot be said that  the  First-Tier  tribunal  properly  directing
      itself would have therefore found that this requirement had been  met.
      The First-tier Tribunal's error cannot therefore be said not  to  have
      made a difference to the outcome of the appeal under  the  Immigration
      Rules.


  26. Mr Biggs argues that on the basis of  the  evidence  provided  by  the
      Claimant it is overwhelmingly clear that the substantive  requirements
      of the Immigration Rules had been met  and  therefore  the  Claimant's
      appeal was bound to succeed with respect to  Article  8  ECHR  in  any
      event, even if there was some technical failure to satisfy Appendix FM-
      SE.


  27. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA
      Civ 387 at [51 to 53] Richards LJ gave guidance on the proper approach
      to the evidential requirements of Appendix FM in  the  context  of  an
      Article 8 assessment:


       51.       In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light of
       the Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as in respect of  the
       substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM. In  other  words,  the
       same general position applies, that compelling  circumstances  would
       have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or LTR  where  the  evidence
       Rules are not complied with.


       52.       This is for two principal  reasons.  First,  the  evidence
       rules have the same general  objective  as  the  substantive  rules,
       namely to limit the risk that someone is admitted  into  the  United
       Kingdom and then becomes a  burden  on  public  resources,  and  the
       Secretary of State has the same  primary  function  in  relation  to
       them, to assess the risk and put in place measures which are  judged
       suitable to contain it  within  acceptable  bounds.  Similar  weight
       should be given to  her  assessment  of  what  the  public  interest
       requires in both contexts.


       53.  Secondly,  enforcement  of  the  evidence  rules  ensures  that
       everyone applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally  and  fairly  in
       relation to the evidential requirements they must satisfy.  As  well
       as keeping the costs of  administration  within  reasonable  bounds,
       application of standard rules is an important  means  of  minimising
       the risk of arbitrary differences  in  treatment  of  cases  arising
       across the wide range  of  officials,  tribunals  and  courts  which
       administer the system of immigration controls. In this  regard,  the
       evidence Rules (like the substantive Rules) serve as a safeguard  in
       relation to rights of applicants and family members under Article 14
       to equal treatment  within  the  scope  of  Article  8:  compare  AJ
       (Angola), above, at [40], and Huang, above, at [16] ("There will, in
       almost any case, be certain general considerations to bear in  mind:
       the general administrative desirability of applying known rules if a
       system of  immigration  control  is  to  be  workable,  predictable,
       consistent and fair as between one applicant and another; the damage
       to  good  administration  and  effective  control  if  a  system  is
       perceived  by  applicants  internationally  to  be  unduly   porous,
       unpredictable or perfunctory; ...  the  need  to  discourage  fraud,
       deception and deliberate breaches of the law; and so on ...").  Good
       reason would need  to  be  shown  why  a  particular  applicant  was
       entitled to more preferential treatment  with  respect  to  evidence
       than other applicants would  expect  to  receive  under  the  Rules.
       Moreover, in relation to the proper  administration  of  immigration
       controls, weight should also be given to the  Secretary  of  State's
       assessment of the evidential requirements needed  to  ensure  prompt
       and fair application of the substantive Rules: compare Stec v United
       Kingdom, cited at para. [15] above. Again, if an applicant says that
       they should be given more preferential  treatment  with  respect  to
       evidence  than  the  Rules  allow  for,  and   more   individualised
       consideration of their case, good reason should be  put  forward  to
       justify that.


  28. Mr Kotas asks me to allow the Secretary of State's appeal and  re-make
      the decision dismissing the Claimant's appeal against the  refusal  of
      leave to remain. However,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  give
      adequate reasons in relation to the suitability requirement which is a
      matter which will require oral  evidence.  The  Claimant  also  raised
      Article 8 in his grounds of appeal. As the First-tier Tribunal allowed
      his appeal under the Immigration  Rules  he  made  no  findings  under
      Article 8. It is clear  from  the  case  law  cited  above  that  that
      compelling circumstances would have to apply to  justify  a  grant  of
      leave to remain where the evidence Rules are not complied with.


  29. Having regard to Part 7.2 (a)  of  the  Practice  Statements  for  the
      Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal  and  Upper-
      Tier Tribunal, the extent of judicial fact finding is such  that  this
      matter should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.



Conclusions:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.  I set the decision aside.

I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.

Anonymity
The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  order  for  anonymity  and  no
application has been made for such an order.
