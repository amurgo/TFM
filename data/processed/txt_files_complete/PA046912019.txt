                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Bannerman ('the Judge') promulgated  on  6  December
        2019 in which the Judge dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  on  all
        grounds.
     2. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-tier
        Tribunal, the operative part of the grant being  in  the  following
        terms:


        The grounds disclosed an arguable error of law but  for  which  the
        outcome of the appeal might have been different. The judge arguably
        failed to give reasons or any adequate reasons in  support  of  his
        finding that the appellant had not  given  a  credible  account  of
        events or of  his  experiences  before  leaving  his  country.  The
        judge's assessment of the appellant's credibility was to  be  found
        at paragraphs 100 to 102 inclusive  of  his  decision.  The  judges
        concerns which individually and cumulatively led him to his finding
        as  to  the  appellant's  credibility  were  arguably  lacking   in
        reasonable degree of particularity and arguably failed to  acquaint
        the appellant with the reasons why the judge found that he had  not
        given a credible account of events  and  of  his  experiences.  The
        judge seemingly approbated the respondent's conclusions as  to  the
        appellant's credibility and in  at  least  one  respect  the  judge
        condemned  the  appellant's  account  as  "incredible".  The  judge
        arguably did not embark upon an adequate or detailed assessment  of
        the  appellant's  account  of  events  and  his  experiences.   The
        application for permission is granted.




Background


     3. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq who was born on 1  January  1993
        and who claimed asylum on the basis of an alleged risk on return as
        a members of a particular social group (PSG), namely the  potential
        victim of a blood feud. The appellant claimed an accident  occurred
        when he was driving a motor vehicle resulting in  his  having  been
        detained by the authorities, taken to a court  but  not  convicted,
        after which he received threats to his life from the family of  the
        person who died, which the appellant claimed led him to  having  to
        flee Iraq.
     4. The Judge had the benefit of not only the documentary evidence  but
        also of seeing and hearing oral evidence being given before setting
        out findings of fact from [99] of the decision under challenge.
     5. The relevant paragraphs referred to in  the  grant  of  permission,
        [101 - 102], are in the following terms:


        100.      I  did  not  find  the  Appellant  to  be  credible.  The
             criticisms of him found in the reasons for refusal  letter  by
             the Respondent are, in my view,  fully  justified.  There  are
             anomalies in his explanation particularly with regard to going
             to a  chemist  with  someone  bleeding  from  their  head  and
             apparently unconscious and  found  a  few  minutes  after  the
             chemist to be dead on arrival at  a  hospital,  simply  to  be
             incredible. There is the lesser aspect of whether he ran  over
             somebody or whether somebody fell off the back  of  his  truck
             that he was driving contained in the interviews and statements
             as compared to his oral evidence  just  simply  add  up  to  a
             credible case even against the lower standard of proof.  There
             were inconsistencies and backtracking by him, particularly  in
             his evidence before me, with the exception of when he  lowered
             his guard regarding the ability to obtain  his  CSID  passport
             from his family in Iraq.


        101.      I concede of course that there are family feuds and blood
             feuds in Iraq and in Kurdistan indeed but his  explanation  of
             what he says happened to him did not allow me to consider that
             he was driving a vehicle on which [M] was killed even  on  the
             lower standard. He couldn't for example, adequately  confirmed
             the period of time he was supposed to  be  on  protection  and
             that altered, there is a Section 8 issue with his fingerprints
             being taken but also travelling through France and Italy which
             must be taken into account and have some  bearing  and  weight
             upon the whole credibility  issue  for  me  particularly  with
             regard to this aspect of his claim.


        102.      His particular circumstances do not  speak  to  me,  even
             against the lower standard, of a blood feud  that  lead  to  a
             well-founded fear of persecution for the claimed death of this
             man and the accidents that strike me, despite his  novelty  of
             explanation with regard to falling off the  back  of  a  truck
             whilst to shoot rabbits, was one that was credible and I found
             it incredible. He couldn't say, even against a  round  number,
             how many people were in his tribe which seemed at yet  another
             bizarre element to this particular claim and one,  as  I  say,
             that I simply did not find to be credible, notwithstanding the
             terms of the interviews and statements.

Error of law


     6. As conceded by Mr  Greer  this  is  a  reasons  challenge.  It  was
        submitted that  the  Judge  dictated  but  had  not  proofread  the
        decision. The lack of care in proof reading is made out as  at  100
        the Judge clearly intended to write that the evidence "just  simply
        did not add up to a credible case", not as it is stated.
     7. It was submitted the losing party was unable to understand what the
        Judge had found and the reasons for the same. It was submitted that
        the Judge rejected aspects of the appellant's case  without  giving
        an adequate explanation.
     8. Although Mr Greer accepted some findings had been made,  he  argued
        there was no explanation for  the  same.  Whilst  the  Judge  found
        something was accepted it was submitted the Judge failed to  finish
        such a sentence by explaining why  he  found  the  appellant  lacks
        credibility. Mr Greer submitted it was  this  latter  element,  the
        "because" element, that was missing.
     9. In relation to the Judge's findings regarding FGM it was  submitted
        there were some inconsistencies  in  relation  to  the  appellant's
        account given to the social worker as identified by the  Judge  but
        submitted the Family Court had made  an  FGM  protection  order  to
        protect the child against the risk of FGM due to the wider issue of
        family and culture in Kurdistan.
    10. The Secretary of State filed a Rule 24 response  dated  31  January
        2021 the relevant part of which is in the following terms:


        2.   The respondent opposes the appellant's appeal. In summary, the
             respondent will submit inter alia that the judge of the First-
             tier Tribunal directed himself appropriately.


        3.   The Respondent respectfully submits that the grounds of appeal
             and permission grant amount to nothing more than disagreement.


        4.   At paragraph 100 of the determination the FTTJ has given valid
             and cogent reasons why the appeal  should  be  dismissed,  and
             contrary to the grounds it is tolerably clear why  the  appeal
             has been dismissed.


        5.   In addition to the grounds in respect of the issue of  FGM  at
             paragraph 103 - 108, the Judge has relied, as he  was  clearly
             entitled to do, on the major discrepancy  in  the  Appellant's
             account in the account given to the Social Worker.


    11. In relation to the appellant's claim to be entitled to a  grant  of
        international protection as a potential victim of an honour  crime,
        this claim was based upon an assertion the appellant was driving  a
        vehicle in which another was killed as a result  of  which  he  was
        viewed as the person responsible for the death by the family of the
        deceased. This is not a case in which the Judge has been  shown  to
        have approbated the reasons in the refusal  letter  without  giving
        proper consideration to the evidence and assessing  the  merits  of
        the case for himself, based upon the written and oral evidence. The
        fact the Judge's conclusion was that the appeal should be  rejected
        similar to the Secretary  of  State's  reasons  for  rejecting  the
        asylum claim, does not amount to legal error  per  say.  The  Judge
        made his own findings having assessed the evidence and taking  note
        of the reasons for why it was felt the claim lacked  merit  in  the
        refusal letter.
    12. It was not necessary for the Judge to give reasons for his reasons.
        A reader of the determination, provided it is read as a  whole,  is
        able to understand why the Judge had the  concerns  he  did  giving
        rise to the rejection of the protection  claim.  The  evidence  the
        Judge had included both an assertion the alleged deceased died when
        he fell out of the back of the truck being driven by the  appellant
        and the same person also being killed by the appellant running over
        him in the truck. The Judge was  entitled  to  conclude  that  such
        anomalies were material as both suggested alternative causes of the
        death of the individual concerned, sufficient to undermine not only
        that one  particular  aspect  but  also  the  entire  core  of  the
        appellant's claim which was based upon an alleged  real  risk  from
        the family of the deceased.
    13. Whilst the issue concerning the  chemist  does  not  appeal  to  be
        explained at  [100]]  that  relates  to  what  was  said  to  be  a
        consequential issue following the individual  falling  out  of  the
        truck or being run over. As that initial event  was  found  by  the
        Judge not to have occurred, for arguably sustainable reasons,  what
        followed thereafter was also not true.
    14. The Judge had the benefit of seeing and hearing the appellant  give
        oral evidence and was able to form a view on whether the  appellant
        was a credible witness. The Judge did not find the appellant to  be
        so  identifying  what  he  described  as  inconsistencies  in   the
        appellant backtracking in his evidence.  That is a plausible reason
        which has not been shown to be a finding outside the range of those
        reasonably available to the Judge.
    15. A judge is not required to  set  out  all  the  evidence  and  make
        findings in relation to  each  and  every  aspect  and  I  find  an
        informed reader of the determination can clearly understand why the
        Judge came to the conclusion he did; namely  that  the  appellant's
        account lacks credibility and the consequences of such a finding.
    16. In relation to the FGM issue, there is reference  in  the  Rule  24
        reply to paragraphs [103-108] of the decision under  challenge.  In
        those paragraphs the Judge  considers  the  background  information
        relating to FGM in Iraq and accepts it  is  a  relevant  factor  in
        light of the presence of the appellant's daughter who was about 3 �
        years of age at the date  of  the  hearing.   At  [104]  the  Judge
        writes:


        104.      What weighs heavily in that case are  the  Social  Worker
             notes that the have. The Social Work Department noted that the
             families of the Appellant and his wife accepted their decision
             not to proceed with FGM in Iraq for their daughter.


    17. The Judge was aware that an FGM PO had been made but did  not  find
        this was due to any risk from family but  from  others.  The  Judge
        finds the appellant and his wife have no intention of allowing  FGM
        to occur to their daughter and have been able to protect  her  from
        any such influences that might have existed in Iraq from family  or
        others for the whole time they were in Iraq.
    18. The Judge notes the ongoing contact between the appellant  and  his
        family and did not find there was a real risk of persecution of the
        child on the basis of membership  of  a  Particular  Social  Group,
        especially in light of  the  fact  the  parents  were  against  the
        procedure
    19. The evidence  contained  in  the  Family  Court  papers  shows  the
        appellant and his wife consented to the making of the  FGM  PO  and
        the fact they could not understand why one was being made as it was
        not required in the circumstances of this family.
    20. The Judge's conclusions are adequately reasoned, and a  reader  can
        fully  understand  why  it  was  found  that  no   entitlement   to
        international protection arose on this ground. It is not a case  of
        it being found by the Family Court, having heard evidence,  that  a
        real risk exists but more of a precautionary measure for the reason
        stated. It is not made out that the making  of  the  FGM  PO  is  a
        barrier to the appellant or any family member returning to Iraq  on
        the facts.
    21. The Judge gives ample reason for why the appellant  was  unable  to
        succeed on either protection or human  rights  grounds.  Whilst  Mr
        Greer submits the Judge should have done more, I find it  not  made
        out the Judge has erred in law in a manner material to the decision
        to dismiss the appeal sufficient  to  warrant  the  Upper  Tribunal
        interfering any further in this case.

Decision

    22. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.


    23. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


I make such order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure     (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.
