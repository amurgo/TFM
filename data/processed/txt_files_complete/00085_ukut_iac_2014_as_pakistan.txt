Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr S Kumar, Legal Representative, Capital Solicitors


     i) Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to  identify  in  her
        decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR does not
        prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so on the  basis  of
        the materials before it.
    ii) "Maintenance of effective immigration control" whilst not as such a
        legitimate aim under Article 8(2)  of  the  ECHR  can  normally  be
        assumed to be either an aspect of "prevention of disorder or crime"
        or an aspect of "economic well-being of the country" or both.

   iii) "[P]revention of disorder or crime" is normally  a  legitimate  aim
        both in expulsion cases where there has been  criminal  conduct  on
        the part of the claimant and in expulsion cases  where  there  have
        only been breaches of immigration law.

    iv) MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 held  that  the  new  immigration
        rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal  are  a  complete
        code. This was because  of  the  express  requirement  in  them  at
        paragraph 398 to have regard to exceptional circumstances and other
        factors.

     v)  It follows from this that any  other  rule  which  has  a  similar
        provision will also constitute a complete code;

    vi) Where an area of the rules does not have such an express mechanism,
        the approach in R  (Nagre)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
        Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31]  in  particular)  and
        Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT  640
        (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements  of
        the rules, only if there may be arguably good grounds for  granting
        leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes
        to go on to consider whether there are compelling circumstances not
        sufficiently recognised under them.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. In Article 8 immigration cases is  "prevention  of  disorder  and  crime"
only a "legitimate aim" under Article 8(2) where there is  criminal  conduct
involved?  Is it open to a  judge in an immigration case in which  there  is
no  criminal  conduct  involved  to  consider  that  the  only  or   primary
legitimate aim being pursued by  the  SSHD  is  "economic  well-being"?   In
either type of case is it incumbent  on  the  Secretary  of  State  to  have
identified in her decision what legitimate aim she considers  that  decision
to  pursue?  Given  that  there  exists  nearly  60  years   of   Strasbourg
jurisprudence on Article 8, one would have  thought  these  questions  would
have received definitive answers long ago, but alas not. That anyway is  how
we see things and is why as  well  we  seek  in  this  decision  to  provide
clarification. As we shall see the  particular  circumstances  of  the  case
have led us to consider each of these questions and several related ones.

2. This is an appeal brought by the appellant (hereafter  the  Secretary  of
State for the Home Department abbreviated as SSHD) against  a  determination
of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hindson who on 28  August  2013  dismissed  the
respondent's (hereafter claimant's) appeal under the Immigration  Rules  but
allowed it on Article 8 grounds.

The claimant's antecedent immigration history

3. The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan who on 6 May 2008 had been  granted
leave to remain as a student until 1 January 2010. Prior to  expiry  of  his
leave - on 22 September 2009 to be exact - he applied for further  leave  to
remain in the same capacity, but this was refused. He appealed and his  case
came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Eban.   On  14  September  2009  she
allowed his appeal under the Immigration Rules. Noting that the only  reason
the SSHD gave for refusing his application was the fact that his  uncle  the
sponsor was not a parent,  the  judge  decided  to  allow  his  appeal.  Her
reasoning was that at the relevant time the  requirement  for  funds  to  be
provided by a  parent  or  legal  guardian  was  only  contained  in  Policy
Guidance, not in the Immigration Rules.  Applying the guidance  set  out  in
Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 719 the judge concluded that the  claimant's  appeal
should be allowed because his sponsoring uncle had shown he was (i) in  loco
parentis; and (ii) both willing and able to provide the requisite funds  for
maintenance.

4. In response, on 15 December 2010, the SSHD granted him further  leave  to
remain until 29 February 2012. Before the end of 2010  he  had  obtained  an
MBA from the College of Technology London.  On 28 February 2012, he  applied
for further leave to do a  Diploma  in  Information  Technology  at  Lincoln
College, London (London International College of Management).   On  19  July
2012 the SSHD wrote to him explaining that as she had  made  a  decision  to
revoke the licence of the London International College of Management and  in
line with her own Rules and guidance, she would give him 60 days to  find  a
new Tier 4 educational sponsor.  On 14 September 2012 the  claimant  made  a
renewed application for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
Migrant under the Points Based System (PBS) to pursue a Level 7  Diploma  in
Tourism and Hospitality Management. When  this  subsequent  application  was
refused on 4 March 2013, he appealed to Judge  Hindson  whose  determination
is the subject of this appeal brought by the SSHD.

5. In the grounds of appeal before Judge Hindson, it  was  argued  first  of
all that the claimant's current position was on all fours  with  that  which
existed at the time of the previous appeal and there was  no  reason  to  go
behind the findings of Judge Eban;  secondly,  that  the  SSHD  should  have
exercised "evidential flexibility" when faced  with  the  evidence  produced
showing financial support from the uncle and should have  requested  further
evidence from the claimant.

6. Judge Hindson swiftly disposed of the  "evidential  flexibility"  ground,
correctly pointing out that there was no evidence that the uncle had  become
the claimant's legal guardian and so "there would  therefore  have  been  no
point  in  the  decision-maker  seeking  further  evidence,  since  no  such
evidence exists".  Neither party takes issue with this finding.

7. As regards the second ground, Judge  Hindson  was  equally  concise.   He
pointed out that, contrary  to  what  had  been  argued  on  behalf  of  the
claimant, his position was not on all fours with that existing before  Judge
Eban. Judge Hindson wrote:

        "The requirement that private financial support be from a parent  or
    legal guardian is now enshrined within the Rules, not in guidance.   It
    is therefore a mandatory requirement.  The claimant accepts that  there
    is no such legal relationship between him and his uncle  and  therefore
    the appeal must be dismissed under the Rules".

 Again, neither party takes issue with this finding. The  new  provision  to
which Judge Hindson refers had come into force on 4 July 2011.



8. The judge decided nonetheless  to  allow  the  appeal  on  the  basis  of
Article 8 in the following terms:-

    "22. The appellant has been in the UK as a student since 2008 and there
         is no suggestion that he has ever been in breach of requirements of
         the student visa.  He has paid the fees for his current  course  in
         full and they are not refundable.  I accept that  adequate  funding
         is available from his uncle.  I accept  that  the  appellant  could
         have arranged  the  transfer  of  those  funds  into  his  mother's
         account, or to his own account, prior to making  this  application,
         in which case he would have had no difficulty.  He did  not  do  so
         because he did not believe it was necessary.  He was advised by his
         college that this was not necessary.  He  previously  succeeded  on
         appeal on the same issue; I have no doubt that he  was  unaware  of
         the change in the rules.  The consequence  of  the  response  [sic]
         decision is that the appellant would have to return to Pakistan and
         make a fresh application for entry clearance as  a  student.   This
         would have financial implications  for  him  and  he  would  almost
         certainly miss one academic year of study.


    23.  I find that the consequence of the response [sic] decision  is  of
         sufficient gravity as to  potentially  engage  Article  8  (private
         life).  I accept that the interference is in  accordance  with  the
         law and that it has the legitimate aim  of  securing  the  economic
         well-being of the UK by sensible immigration  control.   I  am  not
         satisfied that the interference is proportionate to  that  aim.   I
         have already described the consequences to the appellant, and  they
         are substantial.  There  is  no  suggestion  that  the  appellant's
         presence in the UK will have an adverse  effect  on  the  country's
         economic well-being.  Indeed he is bringing substantial funds  into
         the country to pay his course fees and to meet  the  costs  of  his
         maintenance and accommodation."


The SSHD's Grounds of Appeal

9. By way of challenge two grounds were raised by the SSHD.  In ground 1  it
is averred that the judge  failed to have regard to  the  immigration  rules
in making his Article 8 assessment. In ground 2 it is argued that the  judge
had in effect applied a 'Near-Miss' principle contrary to what  was  decided
by the Court of Appeal in Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261, in which Burnton  LJ  at
[26] stated:

    "In my judgment, there is no  Near-Miss  principle  applicable  to  the
    Immigration Rules. The Secretary of State, and on appeal the  Tribunal,
    must assess the strength of an Article 8 claim, but the requirements of
    immigration control is not weakened by  the  degree  of  non-compliance
    with the Immigration Rules."


10. The SSHD sought additional support for ground 2 from Tribunal  case  law
dealing with claims for private life based  on  studies,  in  particular  MM
(Zimbabwe) [2009] UKAIT 00037 which highlighted the point  that  "a  student
here on a temporary basis has no expectation of a right to remain  in  order
to further these ties and relationships if the requirements of  the  points-
based system are not met".  It was submitted  that  the  claimant's  private
life in the UK was neither lengthy nor significant  and  that  he  had  been
fully aware upon arrival that his stay was on a limited basis and that  upon
completion of his studies he  would  be  required  to  return  to  Pakistan.
There were no exceptional circumstances in the way  of  his  continuing  his
private life abroad.  "It is respectfully submitted", it was stated  by  the
author of the SSHD's grounds,  "that  it  is  proportionate  to  remove  the
appellant to maintain an effective immigration control".

11. Before turning to summarise oral submissions  we  should  note  at  this
stage that their effect was to advance a  third  ground  (based,  Mr  Deller
said, on the grant of permission by the Upper Tribunal). Ground  3  combined
two contentions. One was that the judge had erred in  considering  that  the
public interest of the state in the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
control was only to be considered by reference  to  whether  the  claimant's
continued stay in the UK had an adverse effect on this  country's  "economic
well-being".  Arguably there was also a  separate  legitimate  aim,  namely,
"prevention of disorder and crime". The other contention was that the  judge
had wrongly confined the weight  to  be  given  to  the  legitimate  aim  of
"economic well-being" to a consideration of  the  claimant's  circumstances,
without attaching any weight to  the  general  interest(s)  which  this  aim
pursued.


Oral Submissions

12. As regards ground 1 (asserting in effect  that  the  judge  should  have
considered  the  claimant's  Article  8  circumstances  solely   under   the
immigration rules) , Mr Deller for the SSHD said that  its  central  premise
had been upheld by the Court of Appeal  in  MF  (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ
1192, although he accepted that the Court had also  made  clear  that  if  a
judge had considered Article 8  outwith the rules that was an error of  form
rather than substance and so  it  was  not  enough  to  vitiate  a  judicial
decision unless the Article 8 exercise the judge had  conducted  was  flawed
in other respects.

13. As regards ground 2 (addressing the 'Near Miss' issue) Mr Deller  relied
on what had already been canvassed in the  written  grounds.  Moving  on  to
ground 3, Mr Deller made two main points.  First, he  took  issue  with  the
judge reducing the test of "economic well-being" to a simple calculation  of
the individual claimant's cost to the State in respect of the  financing  of
his studies (which only directly helped his college).  Second, he  said  the
judge should have recognised as "known to all" that the  current  government
considered that the maintenance of  effective  immigration  control  was  an
important objective and one that should be considered  as  legitimate  under
all relevant heads of restriction  in  Article  8(2),  which  self-evidently
included  "prevention  of  disorder  and  crime".   The  judge's   blinkered
approach  to  the  Article  8(2)  legitimate  aim  issue   caused   him   to
oversimplify  his  conduct  of  the  Article  8   balancing   exercise   and
proportionality assessment.

14. Observing that the only mention of Article 8 in the  claimant's  grounds
of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to Article 8 was by way of a  reference
to CDS (PBS: "available": Article 8) Brazil  [2010]  UKUT  00305  (IAC),  Mr
Deller maintained that that case did not say that a  student  could  succeed
on Article  8  grounds  without  separately  establishing  strong  ties  and
connections with the UK; and  the  claimant  in  this  case  had  singularly
failed to establish such ties and connections.  In any event,  CDS  (Brazil)
had to be read in the light of the  case  law  of  the  higher  courts,  the
Supreme Court decision in Patel [2013] UKSC 72 in particular.   He  did  not
intend to belittle the claimant's situation, especially as he had  succeeded
on two occasions before a First-tier  Tribunal,  but,  in  response  to  the
Court of Appeal judgment in Pankina (which was what  had  swayed  the  first
FtT judge (Judge Eban)) the government had amended the immigration rules  to
make it a requirement of the Rules themselves that financial support had  to
come from a  parent  or  guardian  and  corresponding  changes  relating  to
Article  8  had  made  clear  that  considerations  of  immigration  control
reflected in the Rules could only be outweighed if there were compelling  or
exceptional circumstances.

15. In answer to questions from the bench, Mr Deller  said  that  there  was
nothing  to  suggest  the  claimant  had  had   any   involvement   in   the
circumstances which led to his college's licence being revoked in 2012.   In
respect of the claimant's academic progress, the  SSHD  had  not  taken  any
point about lack of academic progress, although it  was  a  fact  about  the
claimant's situation that he appeared to  be  moving  sideways  rather  than
upwards.  However, as regards whether or not the claimant could be  said  to
have merited further leave on Article 8 grounds because he  (or  his  uncle)
had paid significant sums to his college,  he  stated  that  payment  for  a
course should not be equated with a right to stay.

16. It was a feature of the claimant's case,  added  Mr  Deller,   that  the
SSHD had refused him not just on sponsorship grounds but also on the  ground
that he had failed to submit bank statements covering the  entirety  of  the
requisite period over which he had to show  he  had  sufficient  funds.   He
asked the Tribunal not to consider that the  SSHD's  evidential  flexibility
policy was intended to apply to a case where documents submitted  failed  to
cover relevant dates.  If the Upper Tribunal were persuaded by  the  reasons
given by the SSHD in the grounds that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  had
erred in law, then  we  should  set  aside  his  decision  and  re-make  the
decision by dismissing the claimant's appeal.

17. Mr Kumar for the claimant urged  us  to  find  the  First-tier  Tribunal
decision correct in law.  The judge was correct to find the  Rules  did  not
apply but that he had discretion to consider  the  claimant's  circumstances
outside the Immigration Rules.  He had done that in  a  fact-sensitive  way.
It was his finding of fact that the claimant was unaware of changes  in  the
Rules relating to sponsorship and the judge was entitled  to  attach  weight
to that factor.  The claimant had made his application himself after  having
consulted a college adviser.  It was  also  the  judge's  finding  that  the
claimant's uncle was in loco parentis and so was a de facto  guardian.   The
role played by his uncle also accorded  with  the  cultural  values  of  the
Indian sub-continent.

18. As regards the judge's view that the state's "economic  well-being"  was
not adversely affected by the claimant's  continued  stay  as  a  fee-paying
student, it was surely right to contrast his case with  that  of  a  student
who had not paid fees.  In addition, there was ample evidence in the  public
realm that overseas students positively contribute to the  UK  economy.   As
regards the "public interest" more generally, in  terms  of  maintenance  of
immigration control, the claimant had done everything  right.   He  had  met
the requirements of the Immigration Rules in substance even if not in form.

19. Properly understood, submitted Mr Kumar, the Court  of  Appeal  judgment
in MF pointed in the claimant's  favour.  Whether  that  judgment  meant  to
address the treatment of Article 8 within the immigration rules generally  -
or  just  its  treatment  within  the  provisions  dealing   with   criminal
deportation - it made clear that so long as a judge deals in substance  with
Article 8 there is no legal error and in this case  (there  being  no  first
stage to conduct) the judge had conducted a viable  second-stage  Article  8
assessment.

20. An important feature of the claimant's private  life  was  that  he  had
already begun his course and would not  be  able  to  complete  it  anywhere
else.  Pakistan had a very different system.

21. In conclusion Mr Kumar invited  the  Upper  Tribunal,  if  we  were  not
persuaded to uphold the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  and
decided instead to go on to re-make the decision  for  itself,  to  reach  a
very similar conclusion, namely  that  the  refusal  decision  violated  the
claimant's right to respect for private life.  The SSHD has not  been  asked
to grant the  claimant  indefinite  leave  to  remain  (ILR);  just  further
limited leave  to  remain  sufficient  for  the  claimant  to  complete  his
studies; such a  grant  would  represent  a  proportionate  remedy  for  the
breach.

Our Assessment

22. It will assist if we first address a number of wider  issues  raised  by
the grounds and the discussion at the hearing.

The MF Issue

23. Both parties were careful in the way in which they sought to invoke  the
judgment of the Court of Appeal in MF.  The difficulty both  identified  was
that whilst in that judgment the court made clear  that  the  provisions  of
the new immigration rules pertaining to  deportation  of  foreign  criminals
are to be regarded as a "complete code", it did not make  clear  whether  it
viewed that as also true of all other provisions of the  rules.   Whilst  it
is not essential to our disposal of this appeal, it may assist  if  we  give
our own observations on this matter. In our judgment, the  ratio  of  MF  is
twofold: to hold that in assessing an Article 8 claim  it  is  necessary  to
carry out a two stage process; and to hold that in relation  to  deportation
of foreign criminals the new rules are a complete code.

24. It will assist if we first of all explain why we have concluded that  MF
is not authority for the proposition that the new rules  in  their  entirety
are a complete code.

       i) The submission put by the SSHD was limited to the  provisions  of
          the new rules dealing with deportation of foreign criminals  (see
          [31]-[34]) and it was that submission which  the  Court  said  it
          accepts (see [40]);


      ii) In [2] the Court defines "the new rules" as "rules 398,  399  and
          399A";


    (iii)    the paragraph in which the court states that  "the  new  rules
         are  a  complete  code"  [44]  immediately  follows   a   paragraph
         identifying the relevant Rules as paragraphs 398, 399 and 399A;


    (iv)   The Court specifically envisages that where paragraphs  399  and
         399A did not apply, the "general law" would.  So much  seems  clear
         from [45] where the Master of the Rolls comments: "Even if we  were
         wrong about [the new rules being a  complete  code],  it  would  be
         necessary to apply the proportionality test outside the  new  rules
         as was done by the UT. Either way, the result should be  the  same.
         In these circumstances, it is a sterile question  whether  this  is
         required by the new rules or it is a  requirement  of  the  general
         law. What matters is that it is required to be carried out if paras
         399 or 399A do not apply.";


    (v)  the logic of the Court's reasoning  is  based  on  the  fact  that
         paragraph 398(c) specifies that if paragraphs 399 or  399A  do  not
         apply then "it will only be in exceptional circumstances  that  the
         public  interest  in  deportation  will  be  outweighed  by   other
         factors". In that way, reasons the Court,  these  rules  "expressly
         contemplate a  weighing  of  the  public  interest  in  deportation
         against other factors" (emphasis added).  The Court  observes:  "in
         our view this must be a reference to all other  factors  which  are
         relevant i.e. proportionality...";


    (vi) when addressing submissions by Mr  Hussain  QC  for  the  claimant
         highlighting respects in which the new Rules  did  not  incorporate
         any Article 8 consideration [39], the Court's rejection is  limited
         to the special nature of paragraphs 398, 399 and 399A;


    (vii)     The judgment sets out in some  detail  the  policy  statement
         issued by the Home Office on 13 June 2012, in advance  of  the  new
         rules coming into force  and  quotes  from  paragraph  67  of  that
         statement which explained that there would be  some  cases,  albeit
         "rare" which would needed to  be  considered  "outside  the  Rules"
         [11]. Miss Giovenetti QC for the SSHD nowhere sought to resile from
         that  position  and  the  Court,  in  accepting  the  SSHD's   main
         submission that the new rules on deportation were a complete  code,
         nowhere sought to disagree with that position;


    (viii)    if the judgment were read as holding that the  new  rules  in
         their entirety were a complete code for  dealing  with  Article  8,
         that would entail adopting the somewhat fanciful position  that  an
         "exceptional  circumstances"   clause  akin  to  that  set  out  in
         paragraph 398 was to be read  into  all  other  provisions  of  the
         rules. We feel sure that if the Court had  meant  to  say  that  it
         would have said so;


    (ix)  the Court's discussion of R (Nagre) v Secretary of State for  the
         Home  Department  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin),  which  was  a   non-
         deportation case, clearly approved of its analysis  of  exceptional
         circumstances, but that analysis  was  based  on  the  Home  Office
         policy statements to the effect that where there  were  exceptional
         circumstances it would be necessary for the  decision-maker  to  go
         outside the rules.


25. We would add that nothing said  so  far  by  different  panels  of  this
Tribunal about MF is inconsistent with the analysis we offer here: see  e.g.
 Kabia (MF: para 398 - exceptional circumstances) (Gambia) [2013]  UKUT  569
(IAC) (which  confined  itself  to  saying  that  it  derived  from  MF  the
proposition that in the deportation context the  immigration  rules  were  a
complete code) and Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct  approach)
[2013] UKUT 640 (IAC). Indeed, if the Tribunal in Gulshun had understood  MF
to hold that the new rules in their entirety were a complete code, it  could
not have stated, without self-contradiction, in its headnote that:

        "after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may  be
    arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them  is  it
    necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there are
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them: R  (on
    the application of) Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);.

26. On the logic of the Court of Appeal judgment in MF (which  the  Tribunal
referred to at its [23]) in the context of deportation of foreign  criminals
there could never be "good grounds for granting leave outside [the rules]  -
because the Court held they were a "complete code".

27. Even assuming we are right about the limited ambit of MF in relation  to
when the new Rules are to be considered a complete code, that does not  mean
we think that the Court's ratio  was  wholly  confined  to  the  context  of
deportation of foreign criminals (this brings us back to what we see as  the
first part of the ratio of MF).  Far from it, it was clearly fundamental  to
its reasoning  as  well  that  Article  8  generally  requires  a  two-stage
consideration (as had been held by the Upper Tribunal in this same case,  MF
(Article 8: new Rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 393). Having  concluded  that  in
relation to paragraphs 398, 399 and 399A the new  rules  required  both  the
first and second stages of the  Article  8  assessment  to  be  carried  out
within the rules the Court noted at [46] that:


    "The UT concluded (paragraph 41) that [the second  stage]  is  required
    because the new rules do not fully  reflect  Strasbourg  jurisprudence.
    But either way, it is necessary to carry out a two stage process"


and at [50] added:


         "Although we have disagreed with the UT on the question whether the
         new rules provide a  complete  code,  the  difference  between  our
         approach and theirs is one of form, not substance."

28.  In relation to the new rules on deportation, the Court made clear  that
the first stage was to consider whether paragraphs 399 or 399A  applied  and
the second stage was  to  consider  whether  paragraph  398(c)  applied[36],
[46]. Outside that particular context  the  Court  described  the  two-stage
process (as applied in MF and  Izuazu  (Article  8-new  rules)  [2013]  UKUT
000045 in the Tribunal) as being to first ask  whether  the  claimant  could
benefit under the new rules and if not, to  go  on  in  a  second  stage  to
consider Article 8 under the general law[21], [30].

29. We have emphasized that the ratio of MF is twofold and  we  have  placed
first the holding that consideration of an Article 8 claim requires  a  two-
stage process because it seems to us that that  part  has  primacy.  Without
it, the holding that the new rules on deportation of foreign  criminals  are
a complete code would seem on its face an extremely limited reaction  to  an
appeal brought against a Tribunal decision (MF) which had cast its  guidance
in broad terms, in relation to the new rules as a whole. But once regard  is
had to the Court's conclusion  that  the  difference  between  the  Tribunal
approach in MF and its own approach was "one  of  form  not  substance"  and
that the question whether it is necessary to apply  a  proportionality  test
outside the new rules "is a sterile question" [45], then it  is  immediately
apparent that there would have been no  point  in  the  Court  going  on  to
consider what the correct approach was under the new  rules  at  large.   On
our reading of MF in the Court of Appeal, the  fact  that  a  decision-maker
wrongly decides to treat the two-stage process as entirely within or  partly
within or partly without the new rules will not give rise  to  legal  error,
so long as the substantive Article 8 consideration accords with the  general
law.


30. It follows from the other part of the ratio of MF - that the  new  rules
on deportation of  foreign  criminals  are  a  complete  code  because  they
contain an express  provision  requiring  consideration  in  the  Article  8
context of "exceptional circumstances" and "other factors" - that any  other
rule which has a similar provision will  also  constitute  a  complete  code
(rule  S-EC.1.4,  dealing  with  exclusion,  would  seem  to  be  a  further
example);

31.  Where an area of the rules does not have  such  an  express  mechanism,
the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
[2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31] in particular and Gulshan  (Article  8  -
new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT  640  (IAC)  should  be  followed:
i.e. after applying the requirements of the rules,  only  if  there  may  be
arguably good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside  them  is  it
necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to  consider  whether  there  are
compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.
Article 8 (2) and the legitimate aim standard
32. Before considering the immigration context (using that term  here  in  a
wide sense  to  cover  both  immigration  and  asylum  cases)  it  will  aid
perspective if we first of all briefly survey the Article  8  jurisprudence,
with particular reference to 8(2). Article 8 of the Convention provides:
    "1.      Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family
         life, his home and his correspondence.
    2.       There shall be no interference by a public authority with  the
         exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law
         and is necessary in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interests  of
         national security, public safety or the economic well-being of  the
         country,  for  the  prevention  of  disorder  or  crime,  for   the
         protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
         and freedoms of others."
The Strasbourg jurisprudence on Article 8(2)

33. The case law bearing on Article 8(2) is  voluminous,  commentary  on  it
even more so. So far as concerns the leading  UK  cases,  it  is  noteworthy
that  they  all  present  themselves  as  being  based  on  the   Strasbourg
jurisprudence. It is well-established, of course,  that  whilst  it  is  not
unlawful  for  UK  courts  and   tribunals   to   depart   from   Strasbourg
jurisprudence,  as  a  general  principle  "the  Convention  should  not  be
interpreted and applied more generously in favour of an applicant  than  the
Strasbourg jurisprudence clearly  warrants"  (Lord  Brown  in  R  (Quila)  v
Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 45 [97]).

34. Leaving aside for the moment the immigration context, it is almost  holy
writ  in  Strasbourg  that  analysis  of  an  Article  8  claim  requires  a
structured approach and the Court will typically reflect that in its use  of
sub-headings, so that it first deals  with  whether  the  claim  engages  an
Article 8(1) right and whether there has  been  an  interference  with  that
right. Reflecting the fact  that  Article  8  is  one  of  the  Convention's
derogable rights, the Court next goes on to consider limitations imposed  by
Article 8(2). The structure of Article  8(2)  is  designed  to  qualify  the
exercise of the rights guaranteed under the first  paragraph  by  specifying
six grounds which the state is permitted to use to  justify  limitations  or
restrictions on Article 8(1) rights  - commonly  termed  (heads  or  grounds
of) "permissible restrictions" or "permitted exceptions".  The  six  grounds
are: interests of national security, public safety, economic  well-being  of
the country, prevention of  disorder  or  crime,  protection  of  health  or
morals, protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

35. Article 8(2)  requires it to  be  determined  whether  any  interference
with an  Article  8(1)  right  can  be  justified  on  the  basis  of  three
standards: that  it  must  be  "in  accordance  with  the  law";  that  such
interference must pursue any of the legitimate aims exhaustively  laid  down
in the second paragraph; and thirdly that an  interfering  measure  must  be
considered as "necessary in a democratic society" (which  essentially  calls
for a  proportionality  assessment  by  reference  to  whether  there  is  a
"pressing social need").

Legitimate Aim and Article 8(2)

36. It is a feature of the jurisprudence that very little attempt  has  been
made to delineate a  precise  definition  of  any  of  the  six  grounds  or
exceptions; and indeed in many cases the treatment of the legitimate aim  is
perfunctory and formulaic. It is even possible to find some cases (e.g.  Gul
v Switzerland [1996] ECHR 5) where the Court does not  address  it  at  all.
Why we do not consider that curious will become clearer below.

Shorthand of 'public interest'
37. It is apparent from perusal of the  Strasbourg  and  UK  case  law  that
these  grounds  are  sometimes  given  the  shorthand   descriptor   "public
interest" or "interests of the community": see e.g. Powell and Rayner v  the
United Kingdom [1990] ECHR 2, 21 February 1990, [41], Series A no. 172).
Exhaustively enumerated
38. The six grounds of permissible restriction are not an  open-ended  list;
they are exhaustively defined: see Golder v UK (1975) 1 EHRR  524,  at  [44]
where the Court held that there are no  implied  limitations  on  Article  8
rights: the only lawful limitations are those specified in paragraph 2.
 Restrictively interpreted

39. The burden rests on the state to establish that  the  interference  with
rights under Article 8 was justified under paragraph 2  of  the  Article  (R
(Quila) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC  45  [44]).
Being exceptions they must not be applied so as to unduly  restrict  Article
8(1) rights; in consequence the exceptions provided for in  paragraph  2  of
Article 8 are to be "narrowly interpreted" (Silver and Others [1983] ECHR  5
[97]; Klass and Others v Germany [1978] ECHR 4  [42])  and  any  restriction
"must be convincingly established" (Funke  v  France  [1993]  ECHR  7  [55],
Soci�t� Colas Est and Others v France, no. 37971/97, [47], ECHR 2002-III).

40. At the same time, the grounds  themselves  are  broadly  drawn:  in  the
words of A H Robertson in his seminal work, Human  Rights  in  Europe,  1963
"the net is widely cast". For example the "economic  well-being"  ground  is
defined  in  terms  of  the  "economic  well-being  of  the  country".   The
disjunctive wording of the "prevention of disorder or crime" ground  entails
that even if there is no criminal dimension  the  maintenance  of  order  is
also covered. And  what  could  be  more  extensive  than  "the  rights  and
freedoms  of  others".  So  however  narrowly  such  grounds   are   to   be
interpreted, their material scope is intrinsically wide.

Each head's general and particular aspects

41. As noted by Baroness Hale in ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for  the
Home Department [2011] UKSC 4 at [28], "each of the legitimate  aims  listed
[in Article 8(2)] may involve individual as well  as  community  interests".
In most cases it is the general or community interest which is  highlighted.
Thus the "economic well-being" ground has  been  found  to  justify  a  wide
range of government policies and activities. In Powell and Rayner v UK,  for
example, the Court accepted that pursuit of the legitimate aim of  "economic
well-being" was demonstrated by the fact that Heathrow  Airport  occupied  a
position of  central  importance  in  the  economy  of  the  UK.  But  in  a
significant number of  cases  the  Court  has  also  had  regard  either  to
individual or more specific elements of this ground, Thus in Lopez  Ostra  v
Spain [1994] ECHR 46 at [58] the legitimate aim pursued  was  not  described
as the country of Spain's economic well-being,  but   "the  town's  economic
well-being- that of having a waste treatment plant".

Identification

42. In Article 8 cases brought before  the  Court  the  submissions  of  the
respondent government will typically seek to  identify  the  legitimate  aim
said to be pursued by the impugned measure, but it is significant that  that
does not always happen and even when it does the Court will not  necessarily
engage with those submissions or, if it does, it will not necessarily  agree
with them. Essentially the Court reconstructs for itself what  it  considers
to be the legitimate aim or aims in  play.  Its  focus  is  on  whether  the
allegation of a violation is made out and in that context it has  regard  to
everything that is known about the  impugned  measure  including  its  wider
legislative context and how  the  relevant  law  or  rules  are  applied  in
practice. So although it is for the state to justify any  interference  with
an Article 8(1) right, that is not seen to require the state necessarily  to
identify expressly the legitimate aim or aims. The state does  not  have  to
pin its "legitimate aim" flag to the mast.

Impact and importance

43. The above observation serves in part  to  explain  why,  to  quote  from
another leading text, van Dijk et al Theory and  Practice  of  the  European
Convention on Human Rights, 4th ed.2006 at 341, "the Strasbourg organs  have
very rarely found a violation of  Convention  rights  by  reference  to  the
legitimate aim standard". This commentary goes  on  to  identify   the  main
reason for this as being that  "assessment  of  this  standard  is  normally
carried out  in  conjunction  with  the  third  standard,  "necessary  in  a
democratic  society",  and  in  particular  ,  with   the   application   of
proportionality". That fully accords with the approach of  the  Court,  e.g.
in Vasquez v Switzerland [2013] ECHR 1182 at [43], where it  noted  that  in
order to justify interference with an Article 8(1) right  measures  must  be
"in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society,  that  is
to  say  justified  by  a  pressing  social   need   and,   in   particular,
proportionate to the legitimate aim  pursued".   To  similar  effect,  using
slightly different terminology, Lester and Pannick, in Human Rights Law  and
Practice, 2nd ed.p.306 describe the three  standards  enshrined  in  Article
8(2) as being closely interconnected:

    "Should the measure prove to be in accordance with the law, the test of
    necessity involves deciding whether there is a "pressing  social  need"
    for the interference and whether the means employed  are  proportionate
    to the legitimate aim(s) pursued by the state. In  conducting  such  an
    examination, the nature, context and importance of the  right  asserted
    and the extent of interference must be  balanced  against  the  nature,
    context  and  importance  of   the   public   interests   asserted   as
    justification".  (Emphasis added).

44. In this way the identification  of  the  legitimate  aim  or  aims  only
becomes  instrumental   at   the   stage   of   assessing   proportionality.
Justification of an impugned measure has to be made by reference to the  aim
or aims it is seen to pursue. Hence it may sometimes  be  important  to  the
striking of the balance to particularise what the elements of  the  relevant
legitimate aim or aims is/are and how much  weight  should  be  accorded  to
it/them in the particular case. The rationale  for  this  understanding  was
noted by Lord Bingham in  Huang  [2007]  UKHL  11  at  [19]  where  he  made
reference to de Freitas v Permanent Secretary of  Ministry  of  Agriculture,
Fisheries, Lands and Housing  [1999]  1  AC  69,  80,  in  which  the  Privy
Council, drawing  on  South  African,  Canadian  and  Zimbabwean  authority,
defined the questions generally to be asked in deciding  whether  a  measure
is proportionate as:

    "whether: (i) the legislative objective is  sufficiently  important  to
    justify limiting a fundamental right; (ii)  the  measures  designed  to
    meet the legislative objective are  rationally  connected  to  it;  and
    (iii) the means used to impair the right or freedom are no more than is
    necessary to accomplish the objective."


45. Thus (to reformulate in  Article  8  terms)  an  integral  part  of  the
proportionality  assessment  is  examining  whether  there  is  a   rational
connection between the aim pursued and the measure  taken  and  whether  the
means used to pursue that aim are no more than is necessary.

Multiple aims

46. It is uncontroversial that a measure constituting  interference  with  a
person's Article 8(1) rights can pursue more than one legitimate aim and  it
is extremely common for the Court to identify more than one legitimate  aim.
Thus  in  Klass  v  Germany  the  legitimate  aim  of  the  legislation  for
monitoring communications was accepted by the Court as  being  to  safeguard
national security and/or prevent disorder or crime.  Thus  in  Silver  v  UK
(1983) 5 EHRR 347 interference with prisoners' correspondence  was  seen  to
pursue the legitimate aim of both protection of morals  and  of  the  rights
and freedoms of others. In  Funke  v  France  (1993)  16  EHRR  297  customs
investigations were seen to pursue the "economic well-being of the  country"
and "perhaps also...the prevention of crime".

The Strasbourg jurisprudence on Article 8 in the immigration context

47. The particular need for a structured approach to Article 8 in the  field
of immigration has been driven home in  a  number  of  decisions:  see  e.g.
Nhundhu and Chiwera 01/TH/0613 and Razgar [2004]  UKHL  27.  In  the  latter
case Lord Bingham said at [17] that in a case where removal is  resisted  in
reliance on article 8, the questions are likely to be:
     (1)      Will  the  proposed  removal  be  interference  by  a  public
         authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to respect for
         his private or (as the case may be) family life?
    (2)      If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
         gravity as potentially to engage the operation of article 8?
    (3)      If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
    (4)      If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
         in the  interests  of  national  security,  public  safety  or  the
         economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder
         or crime, for the protection  of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the
         protection of the rights and freedoms of others?
    (5)      If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
         public end sought to be achieved?
He added the following commentary:-
   1. If the reviewing court is satisfied in any case, on  consideration  of
      all the  materials  which  are  before  it  and  would  be  before  an
      adjudicator, that the answer to question (1) clearly would  or  should
      be negative, there can  be  no  ground  at  all  for  challenging  the
      certificate of the Secretary  of  State.  Question  (2)  reflects  the
      consistent case law of the Strasbourg court, holding that conduct must
      attain a minimum level of severity to  engage  the  operation  of  the
      Convention: see, for example, Costello-Roberts v United Kingdom (1993)
      19 EHRR 112. If the reviewing court is satisfied that  the  answer  to
      this question clearly would or should be negative, there can again  be
      no ground for challenging the certificate. If question (3) is reached,
      it is likely to permit of an affirmative answer only.
   1. Where removal is proposed in pursuance of a lawful immigration policy,
      question (4) will almost always fall  to  be  answered  affirmatively.
      This is because the right  of  sovereign  states,  subject  to  treaty
      obligations,  to  regulate  the  entry  and  expulsion  of  aliens  is
      recognised in the Strasbourg jurisprudence (see Ullah and Do, para  6)
      and implementation of a firm and  orderly  immigration  policy  is  an
      important function of government in a modern democratic state. In  the
      absence of bad faith, ulterior motive or deliberate abuse of power  it
      is hard to imagine an adjudicator answering this question  other  than
      affirmatively.
   1. The answering of question (5), where that question  is  reached,  must
      always involve the striking of a fair balance between  the  rights  of
      the individual and the interests of the community which is inherent in
      the whole of the Convention. The  severity  and  consequences  of  the
      interference will call for  careful  assessment  at  this  stage.  The
      Secretary of State must exercise his judgment in the  first  instance.
      On appeal the adjudicator must  exercise  his  or  her  own  judgment,
      taking account of any material which may  not  have  been  before  the
      Secretary of State. A reviewing court must assess the  judgment  which
      would or might be made by an adjudicator on appeal.  In  Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department v Kacaj [2002] Imm AR 213, paragraph 25,
      the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (Collins J, Mr C M G Ockelton and Mr J
      Freeman) observed that:
      "although  the  [Convention]  rights  may   be   engaged,   legitimate
      immigration control will almost certainly mean  that  derogation  from
      the rights will be proper and will not be disproportionate."
      In the present case, the Court of Appeal had no doubt (paragraph 26 of
      its judgment)  that  this  overstated  the  position.  I  respectfully
      consider the element of overstatement to  be  small.  Decisions  taken
      pursuant to the  lawful  operation  of  immigration  control  will  be
      proportionate in all save  a  small  minority  of  exceptional  cases,
      identifiable only on a case by case basis. (Emphasis added).
Legitimate aim in immigration cases

48. Bearing out what was noted in our general survey, we have not found  any
immigration case in Strasbourg  which  has  turned  on  the  sole  issue  of
whether any legitimate aim standard was  met.  And  it  is  only  relatively
rarely that the issue of legitimate aim has been seen to play a  significant
part in judicial deliberations. The best explanation for why this should  be
so is perhaps afforded by what was said by Lord Bingham at  [19]  of  Razgar
(see above). Question  4,  he  said,  would  "[a]lmost  always  fall  to  be
answered affirmatively".

49. Undoubtedly one key reason why the case law has seen the legitimate  aim
standard to be easily satisfied  (both  generally  and  in  the  immigration
context) is linked to the  fact  that  the  Convention  accords  contracting
states a "margin of appreciation" and it is  not  to  be  expected  of  such
states  in  the  context  of  derogable  rights  to  reliably  establish  by
empirical evidence that the aim it pursues is legitimate.  As  explained  by
Maurice Kay LJ in R (Bibi and others) v SSHD [2013] EWCA  Civ  322;  Imm  AR
[2013] 1007 in relation to the  new  English  language  test  introduced  in
Immigration Rules:

    "28.     I do not doubt that the Rule creates anomalies. For example, a
         foreign spouse who is from one of the exempt countries but who does
         not speak English is able to enter without satisfying the pre-entry
         test, whilst a fluent English-speaking  spouse  from  a  non-exempt
         country who does not have the necessary educational  qualifications
         has the inconvenience of satisfying the pre-entry  requirement.  It
         is simply not possible to predict with precision  how  many  people
         fall into either of those categories. This brings me to  the  heart
         of Mr Gill's conceptual case. His principal complaint, it seems  to
         me, is that the justification proffered by the Secretary  of  State
         is long on  estimates,  assumptions,  predictions  and  speculative
         assertions but short on empirical proof that the amended Rule  will
         not operate in a disproportionate manner.


    29.  In my judgment, there are two answers to this  submission.  First,
         it is difficult for a court to adjudicate upon such a submission in
         the abstract. In a sense, the appellants have  set  a  hypothetical
         ball rolling and are seeking to take advantage of its  hypothetical
         nature.   Secondly,   and   more   importantly,   the    submission
         misunderstands the scope for judicial intervention in a  case  such
         as this. I consider this to be the most  important  point  in  this
         case. It calls for further elucidation.


    30.  The pre-entry test was conceived as a  benign  measure  of  social
         policy with the purpose of facilitating  the  integration  of  non-
         English-speaking  spouses.  Where  a  State  seeks  to  change  its
         immigration rules in order to produce a benign result, it would  be
         regrettable if, in order to justify the measure,  whether  pursuant
         to Article 8.2 or Article 14, it faced a burden which could only be
         discharged by irrefutable  empirical  evidence.  The  Secretary  of
         State's perception is essentially one of predictive judgment.  Many
         a well-intentioned social change is supported by a rational  belief
         in its potential to achieve its benign purpose  but  without  being
         susceptible to empirical proof prior to its introduction. It is for
         this reason that it is appropriate for the State  authority  to  be
         accorded a margin of appreciation in the formulation of its  social
         policy. Without such an indulgence, many benign  reforms  would  be
         stifled in limine. Of course the  implications  of  the  change  of
         policy may be so dubious that it is demonstrably  not  justifiable.
         However, in some situations a margin  of  appreciation  has  to  be
         pitched at a level which allows for change, even if there  is  some
         risk to some individuals, that they will be adversely  affected  by
         it. The principle was articulated in Stec v United  Kingdom  [2006]
         43 EHHR 47, a case concerning Article 14, together with  Article  1
         of the First Protocol, but relevant to the present case, not  least
         because the appellants emphasise the discriminatory aspect  of  the
         pre-entry  test  requirement  (to  which  I  shall   return).   The
         Strasbourg Court said (at paragraph 52):


             "... a wide margin is usually allowed to the State  under  the
             Convention when it comes to general measures  of  economic  or
             social strategy. ... Because  of  their  direct  knowledge  of
             their society and its needs, the national authorities  are  in
             principle  better  placed  than  the  international  judge  to
             appreciate what  is  in  the  public  interest  on  social  or
             economic grounds and the  Court  will  generally  respect  the
             legislature's policy choice unless it is  'manifestly  without
             reasonable foundation'."


    This test  informed  the  recent  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in
    Humphreys v Revenue and  Customs  Commissioners  ([2012]  1  WLR  1545,
    [2012]  UKSC  18).  Without  it,  it  might  become  impossible  for  a
    government to govern without waiting for judges  to  judge."  (Emphasis
    added)

(See also Blake J in MM, R (On the Application Of) v The Secretary of  State
for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) (05 July 2013) at [111]).

50. Notable also in immigration cases is  impatience  on  the  part  of  the
Court with evaluation of the legitimate aim standard in isolation.  Thus  in
Alim v Russia [2011] ECHR 1453 the Court stated at [85]: "It was  argued  by
the respondent Government that this interference pursued  a  legitimate  aim
of protecting public safety or order. However,  the  key  question  for  the
Court is whether the measure was  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  and
proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."

51. That question requires the Court to consider the differential impact  of
the proportionality doctrine depending on  the  nature  and  source  of  the
State policy which interferes with the Article 8 right (SS (Nigeria v  SSHD)
[2013] EWCA Civ. 550 [13]). Thus in Article 8  immigration  cases  involving
expulsion of criminals it is apparent  that  in  addition  to  the  need  to
prevent the individual concerned committing a  further  offence,  there  has
also to be  weighed  on  the  "public  interest"  side  of  the  scales  the
additional interest of the state in deterrence and in expression  of  public
revulsion at criminality:  this  "may  contribute  to  the  legitimate  aim"
(Blake J in Sanade (British Children: Zambrano: Dereci), [2012]  UKUT  00048
(IAC) [48]).

Identification

52. As observed in our general survey,  the  legitimate  aim  pursued  by  a
state's measure which interferes with an Article  8(1)  right  is  typically
identified by the Court itself but that is not always the case.  We  already
noted the example of Gul v Switzerland where the Court made  no  mention  of
it at all, although the logic of their decision was plainly that  there  was
such an aim. It is not uncommon for  the  Court  to  note  that  whilst  the
respondent government has identified two or three grounds, it  will  mention
only one as being engaged: see e.g. Slivenko v Latvia  [2003]  ECHR  498  in
which the government had identified "national security" and  "prevention  of
disorder and crime" but the  Court  treated  the  legitimate  aim  as  being
"national security" only [112].

Identification in terms of "public interest"
53. One can find some decisions of  the  Court  and  many  decisions  of  UK
courts and tribunals where the only identification given of  the  legitimate
aim is in terms of "the public interest"  or  the  "community's  interests".
Thus in the Grand  Chamber  judgment  in    Vasquez  v  Switzerland  1785/08
[2013] ECHR 1182 (26 November 2013 at [39] it is  stated  that:"[t]he  Court
has further consistently held that the Contracting  States  have  a  certain
margin of appreciation in assessing the need for interference, but  it  goes
hand in hand  with  European  supervision.  The  Court's  task  consists  in
ascertaining whether the impugned measures struck  a  fair  balance  between
the relevant interests, namely the  individual's  rights  protected  by  the
Convention on the one hand and the community's interests on the  other  (see
Slivenko and Others, cited above, � 113, and Boultif cited above)."The  same
principle is set out in   Razgar, R (on the Application of) v  Secretary  of
State for the Home Department at [20].  We see no problem  with  that  as  a
shorthand so long as it  is  not  forgotten  what  it  summarises:  the  six
grounds of permissible restriction do  not  encompass  all  aspects  of  the
"public interest", e.g. they do not cover the cultural  or  religious  well-
being of the state.
54. However, use of  "public  interest"  or  "community's  interests"  as  a
shorthand does carry with it the very significant difficulty  that  in  some
cases it may weaken or obscure the particular justification  given  as  part
of the proportionality assessment for the impugned measure or decision.
55. In the UK context the new immigration  rules  introduced  in  July  2012
contain references to "the public interest": see  e.g.  paragraph  276B(ii).
The introductory paragraph to Appendix FM, GEN.1.1  states  that  the  route
this appendix provides for those seeking to enter or remain  in  the  UK  on
the basis of their family life "reflects how, under Article 8 of  the  Human
Rights Convention, the balance will be struck between the right  to  respect
for private and family life and the legitimate aims..." It then proceeds  to
list all 6 grounds of permissible restriction set out in Article  8(2).  The
rules dealing with Article 8 claims made by  foreign  criminals  that  their
deportation would be contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8  refer
simply to "the public interest in deportation"  (see  para  398(c))  without
any other elaboration or more precise identification of any legitimate  aim.
However, as is recorded by the Court of Appeal in MF at [11]-[13], in  a  13
June 2012 statement entitled "Immigration Rules on Family and Private  Life:
Grounds of Compatibility with Article 8 of  the  ECHR",  in  the  course  of
discussing the new 10-year route  to  settlement  for  those  whose  removal
would breach Article 8, it is said at paragraph 67:
    "Bringing A8 [Article 8] within  the  Rules  will  ensure  consistency,
    fairness and transparency in decision-making. We will retain discretion
    to grant leave outside the Rules in genuinely exceptional  cases  where
    it is considered that the Rules will produce a disproportionate result.
    However, it is considered that those cases will be rare since  the  new
    Rules reflect the Government's view - which Parliament will be  invited
    to endorse - of how the balance should  be  struck  between  individual
    rights under A8 and the  public  interests  in  safeguarding  the  UK's
    economic well-being in controlling immigration and  in  protecting  the
    public from foreign criminals." (Emphasis added)
56. And in the Explanatory Memorandum attached to the new  rules  itself  it
is stated, under the heading "Approach to ECHR Article 8" at paragraph 7.2:
    "The new Immigration Rules will reform the approach taken as  a  matter
    of public policy towards ECHR Article 8 -  the  right  to  respect  for
    family and private life - in immigration cases. The  Immigration  Rules
    will fully reflect the factors  which  can  weigh  for  or  against  an
    Article 8 claim. The rules will  set  proportionate  requirements  that
    reflect the Government's and  Parliament's  view  of  how  individuals'
    Article 8  rights  should  be  qualified  in  the  public  interest  to
    safeguard the economic well-being of the UK by controlling  immigration
    and to protect the public against foreign  criminals.  This  will  mean
    that failure to meet the requirements of the rules will  normally  mean
    failure to establish an Article 8 claim to enter or remain in  the  UK,
    and no grant of leave on that basis. Outside exceptional cases, it will
    be proportionate under Article 8 for an applicant who fails to meet the
    requirement of the rules to be removed from the UK." (Emphasis added)
Partial identification: "maintenance of immigration control"

57. In a significant number of immigration cases one finds some  attempt  at
identification of the legitimate aim but it is limited  to  identifying  the
aim   as  "maintenance  of  effective   immigration   control":   see   e.g.
(Strasbourg cases)  Ahmut v  Netherlands  [1996]  ECHR  61  [73],  Osmond  v
Denmark [2011] ECHR 926 at [58], Omoregie [2008] ECHR  761  [68],  Osmond  v
Denmark [2011] ECHR 926, Nunez [2011] ECHR 1047 [84], Antwi [2012] ECHR  259
[86], [93], Ajayi [1999] ECHR 197 [29] Alem Biraga [2012] ECHR 785[56];  and
(UK cases) Lord Hope in [44], the HL  in  Huang  [2007]  UKHL  11  [16],  VW
(Uganda) [2009] EWCA Civ 5 at [29], SS (India) v SSHD [2010]  EWCA  Civ  388
at [53], AN (Afghanistan) [2013]EWCA Civ 1189 [17]; GS  (Article  8,  public
interest not  a  fixity)  Serbia  and  Montenegro  [2005]  UKAIT  00121;  PO
(interests of the state -Article 8) Nigeria [2006] UKAIT  00087,  Nasim  and
others (Article 8) Pakistan [2014] UKUT  25  (IAC)[14],  [19];  Blake  J  in
Mansoor [2011] EWHC 832 (Admin) [38].  (Indeed  in  the  SSHD's  grounds  of
appeal in this case "maintenance of effective immigration control"  was  the
aim the decision to refuse the claimant was said to pursue.)   On  its  face
that has  struck  some  commentators  as  curious  because  "maintenance  of
effective immigration control"  is  palpably  not  one  of  the  grounds  of
permissible restriction, which as we have seen are set out  exhaustively  in
Article 8(2). But it is clear from such cases that the  Court  regards  this
formulation as condensing the most important aspect of  the  legitimate  aim
or aims in play.  Lord Bingham's observations cited above in Razgar at  [19]
convey well why that should be so: "implementation of  a  firm  and  orderly
immigration policy is an  important  function  of  government  in  a  modern
democratic state"; immigration control  which  secures  the  borders  is  of
crucial importance to the interests of the  state  and  wider  community  in
diverse respects. It is one of the interests of the state  that  gives  rise
to a sovereign right of a state to control entry and exit and the Court  has
routinely  prefaced  its  treatment  of  Article  8  immigration  cases   by
confirming that position: In Maslov  [2008]  ECHR  546  at  [68]  the  Grand
Chamber reiterated what was said in �ner [2006] ECHR 873 [54], namely that:

    " The Court reaffirms at the outset that a State  is  entitled,  as  a
    matter of international law and subject to its treaty  obligations,  to
    control the entry of aliens into  its  territory  and  their  residence
    there (see,  among  many  other  authorities,  Abdulaziz,  Cabales  and
    Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no.
    94, p. 34, � 67, Boujlifa v.  France,  judgment  of  21  October  1997,
    Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 VI, p. 2264, � 42)."


58. In these cases the Court must be taken to presuppose  that  "maintenance
of effective immigration control" is the most relevant aspect  of  at  least
one of the six grounds - "national  security",  "public  safety",  "economic
well-being, "prevention of  disorder  or  crime","protection  of  health  or
morals", "rights or freedoms of others".

59.  We  shall  deal  below  with  the  more  vexed  question   of   whether
"maintenance of effective immigration control" properly falls within  either
(or both) the "prevention of disorder or  crime"  ground  or  "the  economic
well-being" ground.

Ancillary aims

60. In the UK jurisprudence  certain  cases,  mostly  those  concerned  with
issues of whether legislation and  policy  itself  violates  Article  8  (or
Article 8 in conjunction with Article 14)  rights,  the  related  point  has
been made that it is  not  always  easy  to  encapsulate  relevant  aims  or
purposes squarely within any of the Article 8(2) heads: e.g. in R (Quila)  v
Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC  45  which  concerned
the compatibility with the Convention of  new  Immigration  Rules  requiring
persons eligible for marriage visas to be at least 21 of age, Baroness  Hale
noted at [72]-[73] that there were other ad  hoc  purposes  pursued  by  the
relevant immigration rules distinct  from  "pure  immigration  control",  in
particular to prevent forced marriages. At [73] she concluded that "This  is
undoubtedly a legitimate aim, in article 8(2) terms, "for the protection  of
the rights and freedoms of others".


61. In  Chapti & Ors, R (on the application of) v  Secretary  of  State  for
the Home Department & Ors (Rev 1) [2011]  EWHC  3370  (Admin)  (16  December
2011at [83], which concerned a human rights  challenge  to  new  Immigration
Rules introducing a  pre-entry  English  language  test,   Beatson  J  noted
JCWI's  submission  that  "immigration  control"  is  not  a   free-standing
legitimate aim and that the less squarely the aims of a measure fall  within
the stated aims of Article  8(2)  "the  harder  it  will  for  the  SSHD  to
discharge  her   burden   of   establishing   that   the   interference   is
proportionate". In advance of giving reasons for rejecting this  submission,
at [64], Beatson J noted two features of the  case  law  that  did  not  sit
easily together. First, it was clear that  "immigration  control"  has  been
regarded as a legitimate aim  for  the  purposes  of  Article  8(2)  without
particular reference to any of the specified legitimate aims. On  the  other
hand, it was not always the case that case law placed focus on  the  overall
system of immigration control: e.g. in R (Quila) v Secretary  of  State  for
the Home Department [2011] UKSC 45 Lord Wilson and Lady Hale had examined  a
particular aim (prevention  of  forced  marriages)  and  a  particular  rule
rather than the overall system of immigration  control.  (We  note  that  at
[45] Lord Wilson had agreed with Lady Hale in identifying the amendments  to
the legislation as pursuing the legitimate aim of protection of  the  rights
and freedoms of others). Beatson J's resolution of this tension at [85]  was
as follows:

    "The breadth of the aims expressly identified  in  Article  8(2)  means
    that many more specific aims will fall within them and  be  capable  of
    justifying an interference with a  person's  Article  8  rights.  In  R
    (Quila) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 45 the
    aim of deterring forced marriages fell into the  last  of  the  Article
    8(2) categories, "the protection of the rights and freedoms of others".
    In  the  present  case  the  categories  of  protection  of   "economic
    wellbeing" (in view of the evidence about the impact on job prospects),
    "health" (in view of the evidence about accessing health services), and
    possibly "public safety" or the "protection of the rights and  freedoms
    of others" (in view of the evidence about the protection of women  from
    domestic  violence)  mean  that  the  new  requirement  does  pursue  a
    legitimate public aim."


62. Since it was clear in these cases that legitimate  aims  were  in  play,
this must be taken as recognition that their broadly-drawn  character  means
that they may include a number of ancillary aims.

Multiple aims

63. Whilst most Strasbourg immigration cases identify either "prevention  of
disorder or crime" or  (much  less  commonly)  "economic  well-being"  as  a
legitimate aim, it would be wrong to think that other grounds have not  also
been seen quite often to be in play: e.g. in Slivenko  [110]-[112],  whereas
the government argued that its legitimate aim was  prevention  of  crime  or
disorder and  national  security,  the  Court  said  it  was  just  national
security. National security was the only aim considered in  play  in  Liu  v
Russia [2007] ECHR 1056 at [60]. In Alim v Russia it was public safety  [85]
although at [96] this was expressed as  a  seeming  amalgam  of  the  public
safety and "prevention of disorder or  crime"  ground  ("the  protection  of
public safety or order"). In Vasquez v Switzerland, the two legitimate  aims
said to be pursued were "public safety"  and  "prevention  of  disorder  and
crime". In Omoregie [56] the legitimate aims were  prevention  of  crime  or
disorder and economic well-being. "The  "protection  of  health  or  morals"
(alongside "prevention of  disorder  or  crime")  has  been  a  particularly
prominent legitimate aim noted in  cases  concerning  expulsion  of  serious
drugs offenders: see e.g. El-Khaouli 40266/98 and Laarej v France 41318/98.

Most common ground - "prevention of disorder and crime"

64. Surveying Strasbourg jurisprudence, both that emanating from the  former
Commission and that emanating from the Court, it is clear that in the  great
majority of immigration cases the principal (often only)  ground  identified
as a legitimate aim is  "prevention  of  disorder  or  crime".  Within  this
category are two main types of  case:  (a)  criminal  cases;  and  (b)  non-
criminal cases. By "criminal cases" we mean here cases in  which  the  state
has sought to expel a foreign national solely or mainly because  he  or  she
has committed criminal offences other  than  those  arising  solely  out  of
breaches of immigration law.  We draw the distinction in  this  way  because
in most if not  all  Council  of  Europe  states  violation  of  immigration
controls can give rise to criminal liability, but the Court  has  ordinarily
made very clear that it regards criminal liability of the latter sort  as  a
by-product of a civil wrong consisting of the flouting of  immigration  law:
see e.g. Nunez v Norway [71].

 a) Criminal cases


65. In criminal cases, the "prevention or disorder or crime" ground is  seen
to be in play almost invariably: see e.g. C v Belgium [1996] ECHR  28  [26];
Sezen v Netherlands [2006] ECHR 87; In the UK the higher courts have  tended
to regard the fact that deportation action  has  been  taken  because  of  a
person's criminal history as ipso facto meaning that the legitimate  aim  is
that of "prevention of crime or disorder":  see  e.g.   SS  (India)  v  SSHD
[2010] EWCA Civ 388 [35] and N (Kenya) [2004] EWCA Civ 1094.

66. In such cases UK courts  and  tribunals  have  also  seen  an  important
aspect of  the  legitimate  aim  to  be  that  of  deterrence.  Thus  in  RU
(Bangladesh) [2011] EWCA Civ 651 at [43] it was said:


    "The point about "deterrence" is  not  whether  the  deportation  of  a
    particular "foreign criminal" may or may not have a deterrent effect on
    other offenders or prospective  offenders.  It  concerns  a  much  more
    fundamental concept which is explained by  Judge  LJ  at  [83]  of  his
    judgment in N (Kenya). The UK operates an immigration control system by
    which control is exercised over non-UK citizens who enter and remain in
    the UK. The operation of that system most take account of broad  issues
    of social cohesion  in  the  UK.  Moreover,  the  public  has  to  have
    confidence in its operation. These requirements  are  for  the  'public
    good' or are in the 'public  interest'."  (See  to  similar  effect  DS
    (India) [2009] EWCA Civ 544 [37] and AM v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1634  at
    [24]).


      b) Non-criminal cases


67. However it is important to note that "prevention of disorder  or  crime"
has also been seen as a legitimate aim even in cases not  involving  persons
who have a criminal  history  and  where  the  only  wrongdoing  resides  in
ordinary breaches of immigration law. That observation carries with it  this
caveat: that certainly seems a fair summary of the first 40 years or  so  of
Strasbourg jurisprudence, but the position is less clear  in  the  past  two
decades. In this more recent period, it is  difficult  to  find  many  cases
that have come before the Court that fall  into  the  non-criminal  category
and in many of those  cases  the  Court  appears  to  prefer  to  frame  the
legitimate aim by reference to "maintenance of  immigration  control"  only,
leaving unclear which legitimate aim(s) this is seen as an  aspect  of:  see
e.g. Ahmut v Netherlands [73], Antwi [86], [93],  Nunez  [84],  Alem  Biraga
[56]; (in the UK) see  the House of Lords in Huang [16]).  Or, as in D v  UK
(1997) 24 EHRR 423 [48], Bensaid v United Kingdom - 44599/98 [2001] ECHR  82
[48] and Omeregie [56], the Court couples "prevention of disorder or  crime"
with "economic well-being".


68. In relation to the position taken in the older  cases,  the  reason  for
identifying "prevention of disorder or crime"  is not stated,  but  it  must
surely reside in the textual fact, already noted, that  the  "prevention  of
disorder or crime" ground has two components, one which does  not  refer  to
crime but to "prevention of disorder". Put simply, the rationale appears  to
be that but for "maintenance of effective immigration control"  there  would
be a real threat of disorder.

69. In line with this, the Court has been at pains to reject any  suggestion
that the  "maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control"  head  is  only
apposite when the case has a criminal element. Thus in  Nunez  [71],  having
identified the legitimate aim as "the public interest in ensuring  effective
immigration control" [84], the Court held that "the applicant's argument  to
the effect that the public interest in an expulsion  would  be  preponderant
only where the person concerned had  been  convicted  of  a  crime  must  be
rejected"[ 71], [84].


70. The Court has also made clear  that  even  when  there  is  no  criminal
conduct  involved,  the  aim  of  "effective   immigration   control"   also
encompasses  general, not just particular, deterrence.  Such  deterrence  is
not just invoked in relation to crime. Thus in Antwi v Norway  at  [90]  the
Court noted:


    "Moreover, as already held on previous occasions, the  possibility  for
    the authorities to react with expulsion would constitute  an  important
    means of general deterrence against gross or repeated violations of the
    Immigration Act (see Nunez, cited above, � 71, and Darren Omoregie  and
    Others v. Norway, no. 265/07, � 67, 31 July 2008; see also Kaya v. the
    Netherlands  (dec.)  no  44947/98,  6  November  2001).  A  scheme   of
    implementation of national immigration law which, as here, is based  on
    administrative sanctions in the form of  expulsion  does  not  as  such
    raise an issue of failure to comply with Article 8  of  the  Convention
    (see Nunez and Darren Omoregie and Others, cited above, ibidem). In the
    Court's view, the public interest  in  favour  of  ordering  the  first
    applicant's expulsion weighed heavily in the balance when assessing the
    issue of proportionality under Article 8 of the Convention (see  Nunez,
    cited above, � 73)."
 71. In a similar vein, Sir Stanley Burnton in FK  &  OK  (Botswana)  [2013]
EWCA Civ 238 at   [11] stated (in relation to non-criminal  cases):  "[t]hat
the individuals concerned in the present case are  law-abiding  (other  than
in respect of immigration controls) does not detract from the fact that  the
maintenance  of  a  generally  applicable  immigration  policy  is,   albeit
indirectly, a legitimate aim for the purposes of article 8.2."
72. Particularly bearing in mind the fact that  it  is  very  hard  to  find
recent  non-criminal  cases  where  the  Strasbourg  Court  has   identified
"prevention of disorder or crime" as the sole legitimate  aim,  it  must  be
observed that there are at least two difficulties in the  way  of  regarding
"effective maintenance of immigration control" as routinely being an  aspect
of the "prevention of disorder or crime"aim. One is that it if it were  such
it would have been very easy for the Court to have said so in all the  cases
where it identifies the aim as the former. The other is  that  when  setting
out  factors  to  be  taken  into  account  for   the   purposes   of    the
proportionality assessment in immigration  cases  the  Court  often  uses  a
formulation  which,  read  literally,   would   appear   to   suggest   that
"immigration control" is distinct from considerations  of  order.  Thus  for
example in Nunez at [70] the Court said:

    "70.  The Court further reiterates that Article 8  does  not  entail  a
    general obligation for a State to respect  immigrants'  choice  of  the
    country of their residence and  to  authorise  family  reunion  in  its
    territory. Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life  as  well
    as immigration, the extent of a State's obligations  to  admit  to  its
    territory relatives of persons residing there will  vary  according  to
    the particular circumstances of the persons involved  and  the  general
    interest (see G�l, cited above,  �  38;  and  Rodrigues  da  Silva  and
    Hoogkamer, cited above, � 39). Factors to be taken into account in this
    context are the extent to which family life  is  effectively  ruptured,
    the extent of the ties in the  Contracting  State,  whether  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country
    of origin of one or more of them  and  whether  there  are  factors  of
    immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of  immigration
    law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of  exclusion
    (see Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above,  ibid.;  Ajayi  and
    Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.),  no.  27663/95,  22  June  1999;
    Solomon v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 44328/98, 5 September  2000).
    Another important consideration is whether family life was created at a
    time when the persons involved were aware that the  immigration  status
    of one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within
    the host State would from the outset be precarious (see  Jerry  Olajide
    Sarumi v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.  43279/98,  26 January  1999;
    Andrey Sheabashov c. la Lettonie (dec.), no. 50065/99,  22 May  1999).
    Where this is the case the removal of the  non-national  family  member
    would be incompatible with Article 8 only in exceptional  circumstances
    (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, cited  above,  �  68;  Mitchell
    v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 40447/98, 24 November 1998, and Ajayi
    and Others, cited above; Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above,
    ibid.)." (Emphasis added)

But perhaps indicative that  the  Court  does  not  in  fact  mean  by  this
formulation to treat immigration control and considerations of public  order
as antinomies, the Court in Omoregie combined use of this  same  formulation
with a finding that the legitimate aim was both "prevention of  disorder  or
crime" and "economic well-being".

 "Economic well-being"

73. There are non-criminal immigration cases in which "economic  well-being"
is the only ground identified, e.g. Berrehab v  The  Netherlands  (1988)  11
EHRR 322, Abdulaziz [1985] ECHR 7 [58] and Rodriguez da  Silva  [2006]  ECHR
86 [44] and Ciliz v  The  Netherlands  [2000]  2  FLR  469.  Indeed  (albeit
unusually) in Berrehab the Court went so far as to specifically  reject  the
government's attempt to rely on  the  legitimate  aims  of   "prevention  of
disorder or crime" and "rights and freedoms of others":
    "25.     In the applicants' submission, the impugned interferences  did
         not pursue any of the legitimate aims listed in Article 8 � 2 (art.
         8-2); in particular, they did not promote the "economic  well-being
         of  the  country",  because  they  prevented  Mr.   Berrehab   from
         continuing to contribute to the costs of maintaining and  educating
         his daughter.
         The  Government  considered  that  Mr.  Berrehab's  expulsion   was
         necessary in the interests of public order, and they claimed that a
         balance had been very substantially achieved  between  the  various
         interests involved.
         The Commission noted that the disputed  decisions  were  consistent
         with  Dutch  immigration-control  policy  and  could  therefore  be
         regarded as having been taken for legitimate purposes such  as  the
         prevention of  disorder  and  the  protection  of  the  rights  and
         freedoms of others.
    26.   The Court  has  reached  the  same  conclusion.  It  points  out,
         however, that the legitimate aim pursued was  the  preservation  of
         the country's economic well-being within the meaning of paragraph 2
         of Article 8 (art. 8-2) rather than the prevention of disorder: the
         Government were  in  fact  concerned,  because  of  the  population
         density, to regulate the labour market."
74. But such cases are few and far between and of these  some  also  mention
another legitimate aim as being in play: e.g., Abdulaziz  [57],  [76],  [86]
and Omoregie [56].


75. The position is different, however, when we turn to consider  UK  cases,
as we shall see when we turn to  consider  more  closely  the  criminal/non-
criminal classification.


   Criminal/non-criminal classification


76. In the UK case law there are decisions that make some attempt to  divide
immigration cases into two categories, criminal and  non-criminal  with  the
former being seen to engage  "prevention  of  disorder  or  crime"  and  the
latter "economic well-being". Thus Baroness Hale in Razgar stated:
    "44. Article 8 cases in the immigration and expulsion context  tend  to
    be of two different types. Most commonly, the person to be expelled has
    established a family life in the contracting state. His expulsion  will
    be an interference, not only with his own  right  to  respect  for  his
    private and family life, but also with that of the other members of his
    core family group: his spouse (or perhaps partner)  and  his  children.
    The Strasbourg court  regards  its  task  as  to  examine  whether  the
    contracting state has struck a fair balance  between  the  interference
    and the legitimate aim pursued by the expulsion.  The  reason  for  the
    expulsion and the degree of  interference,  including  any  alternative
    means of preserving family ties, will be explored and compared.
    45. Sometimes, the reason for expulsion will  be  immigration  control,
    which is a legitimate aim 'in the interests of the economic  well-being
    of the country'. In Berrehab v The Netherlands (1988) 11 EHRR  322  the
    applicant was a Moroccan who was refused  a  further  residence  permit
    after his divorce from his Dutch wife. This was  an  interference  with
    his right to respect for his family life with his young daughter,  whom
    he saw four times a week for several hours each day.  The  interference
    was disproportionate. The applicant had lived  there  legitimately  for
    several years, had a home and a job there, and very close ties with his
    daughter which his expulsion threatened to break. A  similar  case  was
    Ciliz v The Netherlands [2000] 2 FLR 469; the applicant was a Turk  who
    was refused a further residence permit after separating from his  Dutch
    wife, despite the fact that he was still pursuing  an  application  for
    contact with his son; the expulsion thus interfered  with  the  process
    which was designed to fulfil the state's positive obligation to  enable
    family ties to develop between father and  son.  In  neither  case  was
    there an alternative means of preserving or  establishing  family  ties
    between father and child.
    46. Sometimes, the legitimate aim will be 'the prevention  of  disorder
    or crime'. This has arisen in a long line of  cases  concerning  people
    who have lived in the contracting  state  since  childhood  but  remain
    liable to expulsion if they commit serious crimes."
77. Something similar was said  by  (now)  Lady  Hale  in  ZH  (Tanzania)  v
Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4 at [17]-[19]:
   1. These questions tend to arise in two rather different sorts  of  case.
      The  first  relates  to  long-settled  residents  who  have  committed
      criminal offences (as it happens, this was the context of WL (Congo) v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department, above). In such cases, the
      principal legitimate aims pursued are the prevention of  disorder  and
      crime and the protection of the rights and  freedoms  of  others.  The
      Strasbourg court has identified a number of factors which have  to  be
      taken into account in conducting the proportionality exercise in  this
      context. The leading case is now �ner v The Netherlands [2007] 45 EHRR
      14. The starting point is, of course,  that  states  are  entitled  to
      control the entry of aliens into their territory and  their  residence
      there. Even if the alien has a very strong residence status and a high
      degree of integration he cannot be equated with a national. Article  8
      does not give him an absolute right to remain. However,  if  expulsion
      will interfere with the right to respect for family life, it  must  be
      necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the  legitimate
      aim pursued. At para 57,  the  Grand  Chamber  repeated  the  relevant
      factors which had first  been  enunciated  in  Boultif  v  Switzerland
      [2001] 33 EHRR 50 (numbers inserted)....
   2. The second sort of case arises in the  ordinary  immigration  context,
      where a person is to be removed because he or she has no right  to  be
      or remain in the country. Once again, the starting point is the  right
      of all states to control the entry and residence of aliens.  In  these
      cases, the legitimate aim is likely to be the economic  well-being  of
      the country in controlling immigration,  although  the  prevention  of
      disorder and crime and the protection of the rights  and  freedoms  of
      others may also be relevant. Factors (i), (iii), and  (vi)  identified
      in Boultif and �ner  are  not  relevant  when  it  comes  to  ordinary
      immigration cases, although the equivalent of (vi)  for  a  spouse  is
      whether family life was established knowing of the  precariousness  of
      the immigration situation. "
78. In FK & OK (Botswana) the Court was faced with a submission  that  there
could be  no  legitimate  aim  justified  by  reference  to  maintenance  of
immigration control unless it was  linked  to  fear  of  violence  or  other
crime.  Sir  Stanley  Burnton  gave  three  reasons   for   rejecting   that
submission:
   "10.I would reject this submission for three reasons. The first is that
   this point was not taken before either the First-tier Tribunal or the
   Upper Tribunal. Immigration Judge Hanson ...
   11. The second reason is that the maintenance of immigration control is
   not an aim that is implied for the purposes of article 8.2. Its
   maintenance is necessary in order to preserve or to foster the economic
   well-being of the country, in order to protect health and morals, and for
   the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. If there were no
   immigration control, enormous numbers of persons would be able to enter
   this country, and would be entitled to claim social security benefits,
   the benefits of the National Health Service, to be housed (or to compete
   for housing with those in this country) and to compete for employment
   with those already here. Their children would be entitled to be educated
   at the taxpayers' expense (as was the second appellant). All such matters
   (and I do not suggest that they are the only matters) go to the economic
   well-being of the country. That the individuals concerned in the present
   case are law-abiding (other than in respect of immigration controls) does
   not detract from the fact that the maintenance of a generally applicable
   immigration policy is, albeit indirectly, a legitimate aim for the
   purposes of article 8.2.
   12. The third reason for rejecting this submission is that it is
   inconsistent with binding authority. For present purposes, it is
   sufficient to refer to R (Razgar) v Secretary of State for the Home
   Department [2004] UKHL 27 [2004] 2 AC 368 and to Huang v Secretary of
   State for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 11 [2007] 2 AC 167. In Razgar,
   Lord Bingham of Cornhill cited the judgment of the European Court of
   Human Rights in D v UK (1997) 24 EHRR 423, in which the Court said, at
   paragraph 48, in relation to the deportation of the appellant to Algeria,
   that:
      "such interference may be regarded as complying with the  requirements
      of article 8, namely as  a  measure  'in  accordance  with  the  law',
      pursuing the aims of the protection of the economic well-being of  the
      country and the prevention of disorder and crime,  as  well  as  being
      'necessary in a democratic society' for those aims."
      The italics are mine."

79. In JO (Uganda) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010]  EWCA
Civ 10 Richards LJ said:
   1.  I  have  concentrated  so  far  on  deportation.  Cases  of  ordinary
      administrative removal of persons unlawfully present  in  the  country
      operate within the  same  legal  framework  and  in  my  view  require
      essentially the same approach. There, too, the essential  question  is
      whether, if expulsion would interfere with rights protected by article
      8(1),  such  interference  is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim
      pursued; and the answer to that question generally requires a judgment
      to be made on the basis of a careful and informed  evaluation  of  the
      facts of the particular case.
   1. There is, however, one material difference between the  two  types  of
      case,  in  that  they  generally  involve  the  pursuit  of  different
      legitimate aims: in deportation cases it is the prevention of disorder
      or crime, in ordinary removal cases it is the maintenance of effective
      immigration control. The difference in aim  is  potentially  important
      because the factors in favour of expulsion are in my view  capable  of
      carrying greater weight in a  deportation  case  than  in  a  case  of
      ordinary removal. The maintenance of effective immigration control  is
      an important matter, but the protection  of  society  against  serious
      crime is even more important and can properly be given correspondingly
      greater weight in the balancing exercise. Thus I  think  it  perfectly
      possible in principle for a given set of considerations of family life
      and/or private life to be sufficiently  weighty  to  render  expulsion
      disproportionate in an ordinary  removal  case,  yet  insufficient  to
      render expulsion disproportionate in a deportation case because of the
      additional weight to be given to the criminal offending on  which  the
      deportation decision was based. I stress "in principle",  because  the
      actual weight to be placed on the criminal offending  must  of  course
      depend on the seriousness of the offences and the other  circumstances
      of the case.
   1. Where the person to be removed is a person unlawfully present in  this
      country who has also committed  criminal  offences,  the  decision  to
      remove him may pursue a double aim, namely the prevention of  disorder
      or crime as well as the maintenance of effective immigration  control.
      If that is the case, it should be made clear in the  reasons  for  the
      decision, since it affects the way in which the criminal offending  is
      factored into the analysis. Where the prevention of disorder or  crime
      is an aim, the person's criminal offending  can  weigh  positively  in
      favour of removal, in the same way as in a deportation  case.  But  if
      reliance is placed  only  on  effective  immigration  control,  it  is
      difficult to see how the person's criminal offending would  relate  to
      that aim  or,  therefore,  count  as  a  factor  positively  favouring
      removal. On the other hand, it might still have a  significant  effect
      on the proportionality balance by reducing the weight to be placed  on
      the person's family or private life: to take an obvious example, where
      a person has spent long periods in  detention,  his  family  ties  and
      social ties are likely to be fewer or weaker than if he  has  been  in
      the community throughout.  Criminal  offending  can  therefore  remain
      relevant even if the maintenance of effective immigration  control  is
      the only aim of the removal decision;  but  careful  account  must  be
      taken of how it bears on that decision.
   1. The criteria in �ner are not directed in terms to an ordinary case  of
      removal in pursuit of effective immigration control, but some of  them
      have obvious relevance in that context too,  both  as  regards  family
      life and as regards private life. For example, what is said about ties
      arising from length of residence is obviously pertinent to an ordinary
      removal case:  any  difference  in  the  extent  or  quality  of  ties
      established by  a  person  present  in  this  country  unlawfully,  as
      compared with those established by a lawfully settled immigrant,  goes
      simply to weight. Similarly, the emphasis given to the position  of  a
      person who has been in the host country since childhood is relevant in
      the context of ordinary removal too. The first sentence of para 75  of
      the Maslov judgment ("for a settled migrant who has lawfully spent all
      or the major part of his or  her  childhood  and  youth  in  the  host
      country, very serious reasons are required to justify expulsion") does
      not apply in terms to the removal of a person who has spent  his  life
      in the host country unlawfully, but the fact that the person has  been
      there since childhood is still a weighty consideration in the  article
      8 balancing exercise
80. It is not stated in this decision  what  legitimate  aim  under  Article
8(2) it is considered "maintenance of  immigration  control"  pursues  other
than to negative in defeasible terms  the notion that it is  "prevention  of
disorder or crime".

81. In Mansoor, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the  Home
Department [2011] EWHC 832 (Admin) Blake J stated at [34] that  "maintaining
the integrity of our system of immigration control is a means of  protecting
the economic well-being of a  country".  ...protecting  the  economic  well-
being of the country is normally the most appropriate one to consider".

82. We have already noted that the Secretary of State  in  a  13  June  2012
statement  trailing  the  new  immigration  rules  and  in  an   Explanatory
Memorandum attached to the  new  rules  described  them  as  reflecting  the
government's view of how the balance should  be  struck  between  individual
rights under Article 8 "and the public interests in  safeguarding  the  UK's
economic well-being in controlling immigration and in protecting the  public
from foreign criminals". This formulation would appear to  suggest  that  in
respect of immigration control the  aim  pursued  is  "economic  well-being"
whereas  in  relation  to  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  the  aim  is
"protecting the public".

83. It has to be said, however, that there  are  no  Strasbourg  cases  that
seek to classify criminal  and  non-criminal  cases  in  this  way  and,  as
already noted, it is extremely rare for  the  Court  to  identify  "economic
well-being" as a legitimate aim in any of the immigration cases.

84. It would  appear  that  (i)  the  above  trends  in  the  UK  case  law,
particularly the formulation given in JO (Uganda) v Secretary of  State  for
the Home Department  [2010] EWCA Civ 10, which as we have noted left  as  an
unanswered question what the precise  legitimate  aim  was  in  non-criminal
cases, together with (ii) the posture adopted by the Home Office  in  policy
statements and in an Explanatory Memorandum to the  new  immigration  rules,
have been picked up and understood in some quarters as establishing that  in
non-criminal cases  the legitimate aim cannot be "prevention of disorder  or
crime" and that (at least normally) the only  legitimate  aim  is  "economic
well-being". In our judgment that cannot be right. Not  only  does  such  an
understanding find (virtually) no support in the  Strasbourg  jurisprudence,
it also does not withstand a closer inspection of the UK cases just cited.
85. First of all, it is clear that the observations they make  are  attempts
to discern trends, not to establish fixed  formulae  (see  the  above  quote
from Baroness Hale in Razgar ("Article 8 cases ....tend to be") and the  use
by Richards LJ of the adverb "generally" in  JO  (Uganda)  at  [29]  and  by
Blake J in  Mansoor  of  the  word  "normally".  Second,  Lady  Hale  in  ZH
(Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2011]  UKSC  4  at
[18] emphasises the point that even  when  economic  well-being  is  engaged
other grounds may also be in play: ("although  the  prevention  of  disorder
and (sic) crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others  may
also be relevant.") Third, insofar as this line  of  cases  seeks  to  treat
"economic well-being" as the most appropriate head, that is  because  it  is
considered  that  "maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control"  is  an
essential aspect of this ground and as  we  have  seen,   there  are  strong
grounds for regarding this formulation as an aspect of  the  "prevention  of
disorder" clause. Fourth,  in  [12]  of  FK  &  OK,  immediately  after  the
paragraph which  might  be  thought  to  hold  that  "effective  immigration
control" is an aspect of  the  "economic  well-being"  legitimate  aim,  Sir
Stanley Burnton draws support for his position from Lord Bingham's  citation
in Razgar of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in  D  v  UK
(1997) 24 EHRR 423  in which  the  Court  had  said,  at  paragraph  48,  in
relation to the deportation of the appellant to Algeria, that:
      "such interference may be regarded as complying with the  requirements
      of article 8, namely as  a  measure  'in  accordance  with  the  law',
      pursuing the aims of the protection of the economic well-being of  the
      country and the prevention of disorder and crime,  as  well  as  being
      'necessary in a democratic society' for those aims."

86. Sir Stanley Burnton  placed  the  emphasis  (by  means  of  italics)  on
"economic well-being" but that does not alter the fact that the text  refers
to both this ground and "prevention of disorder or crime".

87. Fifth, as already noted, although the Strasbourg Court  in  more  recent
times  has  only  rarely  expressly  identified  "maintenance  of  effective
immigration control" as an aspect of "prevention of disorder or  crime",  it
has made clear in its reasoning  that  it  regards  immigration  control  as
having a rationale outside the criminal context. Thus in Antwi v  Norway,  a
non-criminal case,  at [90] the  Court  noted  that,  "as  already  held  on
previous occasions, the  possibility  for  the  authorities  to  react  with
expulsion would constitute an important means of general deterrence  against
gross or repeated violations of the Immigration Act".

88. A similar approach can be discerned in UK cases.  If one considers  what
was said by Judge LJ in N (Kenya) at [83],  what  he  describes  is  not  an
immigration control system concerned only with prevention of  crime.  As  he
describes it, such a system exists to control the  entry  and  residence  of
non-UK citizens and its operation "must take  account  of  broad  issues  of
social cohesion in the UK".

89.  In our judgment, "issues of social cohesion" go as much  to  the  issue
of "[dis]order" as  to  "crime".  At  the  level  of  theory  and  practice,
therefore, immigration control cannot be  disentangled  from  considerations
of public order and the "prevention of disorder" aspect of  the  "prevention
of crime or disorder" head. Immigration control may also  be  an  aspect  of
protecting "economic well-being", but here at the general  level  there  are
no dichotomies.

Summary of general conclusions on legitimate aims in Article  8  immigration
    cases

90. We would summarise our general conclusions so far on legitimate aims  in
Article 8 immigration cases as follows:

   a) "Maintenance of effective immigration control", whilst not as  such  a
      legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR, can normally be assumed
      to be either an aspect of "prevention of  disorder  or  crime"  or  an
      aspect of "economic well-being of the country" or both.

   b) In expulsion cases "[p]revention of disorder or crime" is  normally  a
      legitimate aim both in cases where there has been criminal conduct  on
      the part of the claimant and in  cases  where  there  have  only  been
      breaches of immigration law.

Our Assessment

91. We turn to consider the Secretary of State's appeal in the light of  our
foregoing analysis.

The issue of identification of the legitimate aim(s)

92. It is pertinent to ask at the outset whether it can  be  said  that  the
judge erred because he chose to address the issues  of  legitimate  aim  and
proportionality at all. Indeed, in her refusal decision  the  SSHD  did  not
mention Article 8 and only mentioned human rights at all in the  context  of
notifying the claimant of his appeal rights.  The claimant for his part  had
only glancingly asked in his grounds of appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
to be considered under Article 8 inasmuch  as  he  had  cited  CDS  (Brazil)
(which as we know dealt with Article 8) and he had not raised  any  specific
argument to the effect that the decision under challenge did  not  pursue  a
legitimate aim or lacked proportionality. So far as  we  can  tell,  at  the
hearing before Judge Hindson his representative did not raise Article 8  nor
did the Home Office Presenting Officer refer to it. The  only  reference  of
any relevance to this issue was made by the SSHD in her  grounds  of  appeal
to the Upper Tribunal which avowed that her decision served the  purpose  of
maintenance of effective immigration control.

93. Whilst if the claimant or the parties had  addressed  these  two  issues
substantively that would have  properly  informed  the  judge's  assessment,
their failure to do so did not prevent the judge  from  addressing  them  of
his own motion. Indeed, so long as a judge considers that an appeal  engages
an Article 8 argument with a realistic prospect of success, it is  incumbent
on him to resolve it, so as to comply with his obligation  under  section  6
of the Human Rights  Act  and  that  will  ordinarily  require  at  least  a
proportionality assessment. We would emphasise,  however  (and  consistently
with what was said by Sales J in Nagre), that the test is whether  there  is
a realistic prospect of success. It would not in our view be erroneous of  a
judge to fail to deal with an Article 8 claim that is only raised  in  vague
and non-specific terms unless there was a Robinson-obvious dimension to  it.


94. It is also pertinent to ask at this stage whether  the  failure  by  the
SSHD to identify any legitimate aim pursued by her adverse  decision  (prior
to an indirect mention in her grounds  of  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal)
precluded the judge from considering for himself what the legitimate aim  or
aims (if any) was/were. Again, we consider the answer will  be  sufficiently
clear from  our  earlier  analysis  which  highlighted  the  fact  that  the
Strasbourg Court essentially reconstructs  for  itself  from  the  materials
before it what the  legitimate aim or aims is/are.

95. But by virtue of binding domestic authority our answer must  go  further
than that. Any notion that there  is  an  onus  on  the  SSHD  as  a  public
authority to identify any legitimate aim which she considers to  be  pursued
by  the  decision  under  appeal  must  be  strongly   rejected   as   being
inconsistent with binding domestic authority. As  noted  by  Lord  Mance  in
Belfast City Council v. Miss Behavin' Ltd (Northern Ireland) [2007] UKHL  19
(25 April 2007), which concerned a  decision  by  Belfast  City  Council  to
refuse to grant a license to a sex shop:

  43. The Court of Appeal cited Re Connor's Application [2004] NICA  45  for
      the uncontroversial proposition that the evaluation of  the  interests
      protected  by  the  Convention  was  primarily  one  for  the  Council
      (paragraph 55). But it went on  to  rely  on  that  case  (decided  in
      relation to article 8) for the proposition that:
           "Where no appraisal of the relevant interests had been made, the
           court could only conclude that the  interference  was  justified
           if, on analysis, it determined that it was inevitable  that  the
           decision-maker would have decided that the article 8  rights  of
           the  individual  would  have  to  yield  to  protect  the  wider
           interests outlined in article 8(2)".
      The Court of Appeal went on to apply that proposition in  relation  to
      both article 1 of the First Protocol (paragraph 56) and article 10  of
      the Convention (paragraph 63). It said (paragraph 56):
           "The interference  with  the  appellant's  rights  can  only  be
           justified, therefore, if either the public authority has decided
           that the general interest demands it or it is inevitable that it
           would have so decided had it been conscious of the  interference
           with the appellant's rights  that  refusal  of  the  application
           entailed."
   1.   Authority now shows that this  is  not  the  correct  approach.  The
      court's role is to  assess  for  itself  the  proportionality  of  the
      decision-maker's decision: R (SB) v. Governors of Denbigh High  School
      [2006] UKHL 15, [2007] 1 AC 100. The court will not require a decision-
      maker to put itself through the hoops of a complex series of questions
      such as the Court of Appeal suggested in that case  ([2005]  EWCA  Civ
      199; [2005] 1 WLR 3372). In the Denbigh case,  Lord  Bingham  rejected
      the "new formalism" that the Court of  Appeal's  approach  would  have
      involved, and said that "what matters in any  case  is  the  practical
      outcome, not the quality of the decision-making process  that  led  to
      it" (paragraph 31).
      ...
   1. ....But, what is the position if a decision-maker is not conscious  of
      or does not address his or its mind at all to the existence of  values
      or interests which are relevant under the Convention?
   1.   The court  is  then  deprived  of  the  assistance  and  reassurance
      provided by  the  primary  decision-maker's  "considered  opinion"  on
      Convention issues. The court's scrutiny is bound to be closer, and the
      court may, as Baroness Hale observes in paragraph 37 of  her  opinion,
      have no alternative but to strike the balance for itself,  giving  due
      weight to such judgments as were made by the primary decision-maker on
      matters he or it did consider."

96. See the similar observations made by  Lord Hoffman at [15] and [26],  by
Baroness Hale at [31]-[32].

97. It is also noteworthy that in Belfast City Council  v  Miss  Behavin'Ltd
their lordships saw the role  of  the  court  (in  cases  where  the  public
authority has not addressed human rights) as extending  to  taking  it  upon
themselves to identify (or at  least  to  postulate)  whether  there  was  a
legitimate aim: see Lord Hoffman at [19], Baroness Hale at [37], Lord  Mance
at [42], Lord Neuberger at [83].

98. It may be thought that where the "public authority" is the  SSHD  rather
than a local council or a school governor, that should make a difference  in
that caseworkers acting on behalf of the SSHD must be assumed to  know  (and
are instructed) that  they  must  decide  whether  their  decisions  are  in
compliance  with  a  person's  human  rights,  but  in  our  view  any  such
difference cannot extinguish  the  general  principle  enunciated  by  their
lordships in relation to what a court or tribunal must do  when  considering
the decision of a "public authority" which has not addressed  human  rights.


99. Further, in relation to any failure to identify a  legitimate  aim,  the
extent of any difference is mitigated by at least two  factors.   First,  to
the extent that it can be said that SSHD caseworkers can be assumed to  know
they must consider a person's human rights, by the same  token,  it  can  be
assumed that the public knows that such officials make decisions  on  behalf
of a government department which has a statutory responsibility to  apply  a
legal framework of  immigration  control  over  third-country  nationals  as
contained in statute and immigration rules.  Indeed  (as  noted  earlier  at
[55], in respect of family members rule GEN.1.1 of Appendix FM  states  that
this appendix  reflects  how  the  balance  is  to  be  struck  between  the
individual's right to respect for family life and all 6 of  the  "legitimate
aims" set  out  in  Article  8(2).   To  this  extent  (and  absent  special
circumstances) it is self-evident that decisions made by the  SSHD  (and  by
ECOs) normally pursue the aim of maintaining effective immigration  control.

         .
100. Second, the SSHD has stated in the public realm that she considers  the
new immigration rules brought into force in July 2012  to  comply  with  the
Human Rights Act and has said on numerous occasions before  the  courts  and
in published policy and in the June 2012  Explanatory  Memorandum  that  she
considers  these  rules  to  be  an  important  mechanism  for   maintaining
effective immigration control.

101. Accordingly in our judgment it was not incumbent on the SSHD  in  these
proceedings to have  identified  what  she  considered  the  legitimate  aim
pursued by her decision to be. That she considered her  decision  to  pursue
the effective maintenance of immigration control was something the  claimant
could be considered to be on notice of.

The SSHD's grounds

102. As regards ground 1 (which sought to rely  on  an  MF-related  argument
that the judge was wrong not  to  have  treated  the  claimant's  Article  8
circumstances solely under the new rules), it will be apparent that  whether
one interprets MF as establishing that  the  new  Immigration  Rules  are  a
complete code regarding Article 8 in general or  only  in  relation  to  the
deportation provisions set out in paragraphs 398,399 and  399A,  the  First-
tier judge conducted a substantive Article 8 assessment by reference to  his
understanding of the general law on Article 8. As Mr Deller  conceded,  that
assessment cannot be vitiated by legal error just because it  was  not  made
within the Rules.

103. Concerning ground 2, we do not consider that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
judge relied in any significant way on a "Near-Miss" principle. He  did,  it
is true, attach significant weight to the fact that  the  claimant  had  met
the requirements of the immigration rules in substance, but the  reasons  he
gave for allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds dwelt not on the  fact  of
a 'Near Miss' but, as he saw it, on the disproportionality  of  the  adverse
immigration decision given the claimant's particular  circumstances.  We  do
not think the judge was doing anything more here  than  what  Lord  Carnwath
described approvingly in Patel at [56]  as  treating  "the  context  of  the
rules [as] relevant to the consideration of proportionality". If  the  judge
has fallen into error,  then,  it  is  in  the  way  he  has  conducted  the
proportionality assessment in the light of the relevant  legitimate  aim  or
aims.

104. This brings us to ground 3, in respect of which we do think  the  judge
did fall into legal error.

105. Applying the main principles we have derived from case law  on  Article
8(2)  to  the  judge's  assessment  of  the  claimant's  case,  it  will  be
immediately  apparent  that  the  judge  wrongly  addressed  his  task  when
considering the proportionality of the legitimate  aim  of  "economic  well-
being" (which was the only legitimate aim  he  considered  to  be  engaged).
Although making reference to "the legitimate aim of  securing  the  economic
well-being of  the  UK  by  sensible  immigration  control"  (which  clearly
identified that this head extended to the general  (or  "macro")  level,  he
wholly confined his actual assessment of the weight to be  attached  to  the
legitimate aim pursued by the decision of the SSHD to a simple  calculus  at
the  individual or "micro" level, so that all that appeared in  the  balance
sheet were the funds the claimant had paid in course fees and the fact  that
he had enough to maintain and accommodate  himself.   He  wholly  overlooked
that even in cases where there is no  cost  to  the  state  incurred  by  an
individual student in terms of fees and maintenance and  accommodation,  the
immigration rules reflect an assessment made  by  the  government  with  the
sanction of Parliament of  what  requirements  are  necessary  in  order  to
ensure sufficient control on the number of persons entering  into  or  being
able to stay in the UK and for how long and under  what  conditions.   Their
terms quintessentially require  an  assessment  at  the  "macro"  level.  He
failed to take into account  whether  general  aspects  of  "economic  well-
being", including the need to limit the numbers who have  access  to  public
services and the benefits of the  NHS  and  who  are  able  to  compete  for
housing and for employment with those already here: see FK & OK [11]  (supra
[78]).

106. Even if we were to reject Mr Deller's argument that the judge  at  [23]
appeared to confine  the issue of  "economic  well-being"  to  the  economic
well-being  of  a  private  college  (  "the  judge  said  "he  is  bringing
substantial funds into the country to pay his course fees....") and  instead
inferred that the judge had also  in  mind  the  contribution  made  to  the
country's economy by overseas students, it is plain that  he  did  not  take
into account other general aspects of the legitimate aim of "economic  well-
being" identified in the previous paragraph.

107. That is not to say that  a  judge  is  prevented  when  conducting  the
balancing exercise of assessing proportionality from weighing in a  person's
favour that he contributes financially or in other ways to  the  economy  or
the public good or that he has not been a drain  on  the  public  purse.  If
such factors are combined with  other  strong  factors  in  favour  of  that
person, that might mean that general considerations of  economic  well-being
are outweighed. But in the claimant's case  there  was  a  glaring  lack  of
factors strongly in his favour.

108.  In  our  view  this  error  by  the  judge  fundamentally  skewed  his
proportionality assessment. It led him to attach no or virtually  no  weight
to the legitimate aim of "economic well-being" pursued by  the  decision  of
the SSHD and as a consequence to regard the scales as weighted in favour  of
the individual claimant notwithstanding that  his  case  had  no  strong  or
compelling  features.  This  error  necessitates  that  we  set  aside   his
decision.

109. We have yet to comment on the other limb to Mr Deller's ground 3  which
argued that the judge had also erred in law in considering that  the  public
interest was only to be adjudged by  reference  to  whether  the  claimant's
continued stay in the UK had an adverse effect on this  country's  "economic
well-being" thereby ignoring a separate legitimate  aim  of  "prevention  of
disorder or crime". We have concluded that  this  contention  has  not  been
made out. We  have  in  mind  that  in  describing  the  legitimate  aim  as
"securing  the  economic  well-being  of  the  UK  by  sensible  immigration
control", the judge appeared to amalgamate two aims, that of "economic well-
being" and that of "maintenance of effective  immigration  control".  Whilst
as we have seen the latter is not a legitimate aim  as  such,  it  could  be
said that the judge was doing no more than what  is  commonly  done  by  the
Strasbourg Court and the UK courts, of treating it as a self-evident  aspect
of at least one of the legitimate aims sanctioned by  Article  8(2).  Whilst
we think  that  normally  "maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control"
should be regarded as an aspect of "prevention of  disorder  or  crime",  we
recognise that some Strasbourg jurisprudence has seen it  as  an  aspect  of
"economic well-being" on its own or (more  commonly)  as  well.   That  also
comports with a line of UK cases which has linked "maintenance of  effective
immigration control" and "economic well-being".


Our Decision

110. We turn then to re-make for ourselves the decision  against  which  the
claimant appealed. We take into account a short statement submitted  by  the
claimant dated 3 February 2014, although it adds nothing to the evidence  we
already have about his case.

111. In most respects the claimant's is a run  of  the  mill  case.   He  is
someone who has been in the UK now for  nearly  6  years  (he  came  in  May
2008); has never been in breach of immigration controls; was  considered  by
the SSHD to have met all of the requirements  of  the  relevant  immigration
rules save for two and of these one (relating to  his  sponsor)  he  met  de
facto, the other may possibly have been rectified if the SSHD had  told  him
his bank statements did not fully cover the  requisite  period;  is  someone
who  via his uncle  has invested a considerable sum in order to advance  his
own level of education and skills; and is someone who believes that  if  his
appeal is refused, "then the hard earned money  of  my  family  will  go  to
drain".

112.  There are also two somewhat unusual features of his  case.   There  is
first of all the fact that when the SSHD previously refused  to  extend  his
leave to remain as a student on the basis  that  he  was  not  funded  by  a
parent or guardian, a  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  allowed  his  appeal  on
Pankina grounds.  There is  the  further  fact  that  when  the  SSHD  later
refused him on the same ground, a First-tier Tribunal judge also found  that
he was a genuine student  who  had  only  failed  to  comply  with  the  new
requirement of the rules regarding financial support by sponsors because  he
had relied on college advisors.

113. On the other side of the scales, the claimant had not been  in  the  UK
for a lengthy period; although he had never been in  breach  of  immigration
laws, he had only ever been granted entry and leave to remain as  a  student
here for temporary purposes of study; in the time he had been  here  he  had
already obtained the qualification which had been the  basis  of  his  entry
clearance application (a  Masters  in  Business  Administration  from  Alpha
College in 2010); in respect of other aspects of his private  life  ties  he
did not seek to rely on  ties  of  friendship  or  community,  even  in  the
witness statement submitted shortly before the  hearing  before  the  First-
tier Tribunal in August 2013; although he had succeeded  before  the  First-
tier Tribunal in 2009 on Pankina grounds, the law had  subsequently  changed
and it is settled law that applicants must take  the  immigration  rules  at
the time their cases fall for decision:  see Munir and  Patel;  although  he
was unaware of  the  changes  in  the  Immigration  Rules  (an  unchallenged
finding of Judge Hindson), as a general rule ignorance  of  the  law  is  no
excuse; the fact of the matter was that the rules had been amended so as  to
incorporate earlier policy guidance that  a  financial  sponsor  must  be  a
parent or guardian: the claimant's application was not only refused  because
he did not meet the financial sponsor requirement, he  had  also  failed  to
submit bank statements covering the entirety of the requisite period.

114. Judge Hindson considered that if the appeal was not allowed on  Article
8 grounds "he would almost certainly  miss  one  academic  year  of  study".
Since by virtue of s.85(4) we must decide this appeal on the basis of  facts
as they stand today (this being  a  case  in  which  we  are  re-making  the
decision), that point has a diminished weight because the  claimant  is  now
only a few weeks away from completing his course  (ending  18  March  2014).
But even as matters stood before Judge Hindson, it is difficult to see  what
evidential foundation he had for considering the consequence  would  "almost
certainly" be the missing one academic  year.   Certainly  many  courses  of
this kind are available in modular form.  In the absence of evidence  as  to
what credit colleges in Pakistan might give for modules completed  on  a  UK
course of this kind (or as to whether his UK  college  would  allow  him  to
complete the course by  electronic  means),  we  draw  no  firm  conclusions
ourselves, but we can certainly say that we have not seen  any  evidence  to
show that the claimant would lose as much as a whole academic year.  In  any
event that consideration, whilst not a trivial matter, is not  in  our  view
one which takes (or should take) matters much  further  in  the  context  of
Article 8.

115. Particularly bearing in mind the observations made by Lord Carnwath  in
Patel both about student cases in general [at 57] and about the two  student
appeals of Mr Anwar and Mr Alam at [58]-[59] and also the observations  made
by the Upper Tribunal in Nasim and  others  (Article  8)  at  [26]-[27],  we
consider the claimant cannot  succeed  on  Article  8  grounds.   There  are
simply no strong or compelling circumstances surrounding his case.   In  our
view, to allow his appeal on Article  8  grounds  would  be  to  debase  the
currency.  There are no significant elements of private life engaged by  the
circumstances of his case.  To the extent that  he  can  be  said  (via  his
uncle) to have invested in a UK  education,  he  has  already  obtained  one
degree and the further one he is now  doing  does  not  represent  a  higher
level degree, although it is right to say that the  SSHD  did  not  seek  to
refuse his decision under the relevant requirement of  the  Rules  governing
academic progress.   In relation to his family life, he has close ties  back
in Pakistan with his mother and  his  uncle  and  his  family.  He  has  not
adduced any evidence to show that he has significant private life ties  with
friends or a wider community.

116. For the above reasons we dismiss this appeal.  The  claimant  does  not
succeed under the Immigration Rules or under Article 8.

117. To conclude:

     The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and its decision is set aside.

     The decision we re-make is to dismiss the appeal on all grounds.
