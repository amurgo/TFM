Representation:

For the claimant: In person, unrepresented
For the appellant:     Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Ayman Yafawi, date of birth 27.10.65,  is  a  citizen  of
    Palestine.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley  promulgated  19.9.14,  allowing,  on
    human rights grounds, the claimant's appeal against the decision of the
    Secretary of State, dated 18.6.14, to refuse his application for an EEA
    Permanent Residence Card as confirmation of a right to  reside  in  the
    UK, pursuant to the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 16.9.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  French  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    17.11.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 27.1.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Ransley should be set aside.

 6. At 44 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Ransley  found
    that the claimant failed to discharge the  burden  of  proof  that  the
    sponsor had been exercising Treaty rights as a worker in the UK  during
    the necessary 5-year period,  and  thus  that  the  claimant  does  not
    qualify for a permanent residence card under regulation 15.

 7. In essence, the grounds of application for permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal complain that as: the appeal was against the refusal  to
    issue a permanent residence card; there was no application for leave to
    remain on the basis of family or private life; article 8 had  not  been
    raised in the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal; no  removal
    decision had been made; article 8 ECHR did not fall  for  consideration
    in the First-tier  Tribunal  appeal  and  thus  the  judge  misdirected
    herself in law in finding the  decision  disproportionately  interferes
    with the appellant's article 8 rights.

 8. A further ground of appeal is that the article 8 assessment was  flawed
    in that it failed to take into account that the claimant and his family
    could, if they so choose, return to Germany,  the  nationality  of  his
    wife and child, and where they were living prior to coming to  the  UK.
    Neither the claimant nor his family members had any right to  life  and
    education in the UK per se, and article 8 does not entitle  the  family
    to choose their country of residence.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  French  considered  the  human
    rights point 'moot' but having regard to the fact  that  there  was  no
    removal decision and the decision letter invited the claimant to submit
    an article 8 application, found the issue arguable.

10. The refusal decision, which does not include  a  section  120  one-stop
    warning, explains that immigration rules,  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph
    276ADE, set out the requirements for those seeking leave  to  enter  or
    remain on the basis of article 8 private and family life. This requires
    a separate chargeable application on the specified form FLR(M) for  the
    partner or parent route, or FLR(O) for the private life  route.  "Since
    you have not made a valid  application  for  Article  8  consideration,
    consideration has not been given as to whether your removal from the UK
    would breach Article 8 of the ECHR. Additionally,  it  is  pointed  out
    that a decision not to issue a residence card/permanent residence  card
    does not require you to leave the UK if you can  otherwise  demonstrate
    that you have a right to reside under the Regulations."

11. I note that the grounds of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  do  not
    raise any article 8 ECHR private or family life claim.  It  appears  to
    have been raised for the first time in the  skeleton  argument  of  the
    claimant's reprsentative, Ms Solanki, at the First-tier Tribunal appeal
    hearing. She submitted that the claimant's  removal  would  breach  his
    article 8 rights. For the Secretary of  State,  Mr  Townsend  submitted
    that as no removal  directions  had  been  made  against  the  claimant
    article 8 did not fall to be decided in the First-tier Tribunal appeal.
    At ï¿½49 the judge recognised that there  was  no  removal  decision  but
    considered that the issues relating to article 8 "are to be decided  on
    a hypothetical basis." What that means is far from clear, as there  was
    nothing hypothetical about the  decision  a  few  paragraphs  later  to
    "conclude  that  a  decision  to  remove   the   appellant   would   be
    disproportionate by reference to article  8(2)  of  the  ECHR"  and  to
    proceed to allow the appeal on human rights grounds.

12. In FK Kenya) v  SSHD  [2010]  EWCA  Civ  1302,  Lord  Justice  Sullivan
    observed, "Question  (iii):  family  life.  Before  dealing  with  this
    question I would observe that  it  is  very  doubtful  whether  it  was
    appropriate for the Article 8 issues raised by the  appellant  to  have
    been resolved at this stage when there had been no removal decision. If
    and when a removal decision is made  the  appellant  will  be  able  to
    appeal against that decision and as part of that appeal he will be able
    to include Article 8 grounds in his appeal. It will of  course  be  for
    the Secretary of State to decide whether to deport the appellant  as  a
    person who has committed criminal offences  or  whether  he  should  be
    removed under the Immigration Rules. It will be for the Tribunal at the
    stage of any appeal against such  a  decision  to  weigh  the  relevant
    factors as they exist at that time. It seems to me  therefore  that  it
    was at best premature for the Tribunal to  be  asked  to  consider  the
    Article 8 issue in this appeal."  As  it  happens,  in  that  case  the
    appellant had asked the Immigration Judge to  consider  the  Article  8
    issue and Lord Justice Sullivan said that  "the  appellant  can  hardly
    complain now that that is what the Immigration Judge proceeded to  do,"
    the appellant appealing the decision.

13. In line with the cases of Lamichhane v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2012] EWCA Civ 260 and Jaff  (s.120  notice;  statement  of
    "additional grounds") [2012] UKUT  00396(IAC),  in  the  absence  of  a
    section 120 notice, there  is  no  jurisdiction  for  the  Tribunal  to
    consider any ground for the grant of leave  to  remain  different  from
    that which was the subject of the decision of the  Secretary  of  State
    appealed against. An appellant on whom no section 120 notice  has  been
    served may not raise before the Tribunal any ground for  the  grant  of
    leave to remain different from  that  which  was  the  subject  of  the
    decision of the Secretary of State appealed against.  It  follows  that
    there was no basis for the Tribunal to consider article 8.

14. I also adopt the observations of Lord Justice Sullivan in FK (Kenya) as
    being apposite to  this  case.  There  was  no  removal  decision.  The
    application was for a permanent residence card, which was refused.  The
    decision did not alter the status quo at all. I find  it  difficult  to
    understand in those circumstances how the decision could be said to  be
    disproportionate.

15. In fact, carefully read, Judge Ransley's  decision  was  not  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State was disproportionate,  but  that  "a
    decision to remove" the appellant would be disproportionate.  As  there
    was no such decision, there was no basis for  allowing  the  appeal  on
    human  rights  grounds.  I  fail  to  see  the  purpose  of  the  judge
    considering the matter on  a  hypothetical  basis  when  there  was  no
    removal decision and any such decision in the future would engender the
    right of the claimant to appeal  and  raise  private  and  family  life
    claims pursuant to article 8 ECHR.

16. I further find that the article 8 assessment was flawed for the reasons
    cited in the grounds of appeal. In particular, the judge failed to take
    into account that the claimant and his family had previously  lived  in
    Germany, the nationality of his wife and children. They came to the  UK
    from Germany in 2008. The judge found that the claimant had no right to
    a permanent residence card (without deciding whether he was entitled to
    a non-permanent residence card), and as not British but German citizens
    they had no right to reside or remain or take  advantage  of  education
    and other benefits of life in the UK, except in accordance with EU free
    movement law and in particular under the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
    2006, as amended. There was apparently no evidence as to why they could
    not continue family life in Germany, where they had previously  enjoyed
    family life. The considerations at ï¿½51 of the decision failed  to  take
    these matters into account, thereby rendering any article 8  assessment
    rather one-sided, so that it amounted to an error of law.

17. It is also relevant to point out that the claimant was and  remains  in
    possession of an EEA residence card, and thus he was not being asked to
    leave. What he sought, which was refused,  was  a  permanent  residence
    card, which requires a 5-year period of exercising Treaty rights by the
    EEA national spouse.

18. Further, the judge failed entirely  to  consider  the  family  and  any
    private life claim under Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE before  going
    on to consider article 8 ECHR. Neither did the judge consider,  as  she
    was required to do, the public interest  considerations  under  section
    117B of the 2002 Act. In the circumstances, it is clear  that  even  if
    there was any merit in going on to an  article  8  assessment,  it  was
    flawed and amounted to clear errors of law.

19. There has been  no  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the claimant did not meet the requirements of  regulation
    15 for a permanent residence card and that part of the decision remains
    unchallenged. In fact, Mr Yafawi told me that he  had  'withdrawn'  his
    appeal and made a fresh application for an EEA residence card.

Conclusion & Decision:

20. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
