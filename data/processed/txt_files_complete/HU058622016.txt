Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J. Walsh, counsel instructed by Lupins,
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Z. Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                                  DECISION

   1. The appellant, who is a citizen of Nigeria, has an established pattern
      of securing entry clearance as a visitor,  his  adult  children  being
      resident in this country. He last arrived in the United Kingdom in May
      2014 and was admitted as a visitor for  the  purpose  of  attending  a
      family wedding. Unfortunately, he then fell ill and, on 25 March  2015
      he was granted leave to  remain  as  a  visitor  for  the  purpose  of
      receiving private medical treatment  until  25  September  2015.  Just
      before that leave expired, he applied for leave to remain on the basis
      of rights protected by article 8 of the ECHR. The appellant  has  been
      granted permission  to  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Macdonald who, by  a  determination  promulgated  on  7
      April 2017, dismissed his appeal against refusal of that human  rights
      claim.

   2. Although there is, before the Upper Tribunal, one appeal,  that  being
      the appeal of Mr Uduehi, the judge treated the appeal  before  him  as
      being that of both Mr Uduehi  and  his  wife,  Mrs  Francisca  Uduehi.
      Permission to appeal has been granted  to  Mr  Uduehi  only.  This  is
      wholly unsurprising since, on the papers before me,  it  appears  that
      the application for permission to appeal  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal on behalf of Mr Uduehi alone. Neither party raised any  issue
      concerning this and submissions from both Mr Walsh on  behalf  of  the
      appellant and Ms Ahmad on behalf of the respondent were  focused  upon
      the circumstances of Mr Uduehi alone. If such an application was  made
      on behalf of Mrs Uduehi, I have not seen it. It may be  that,  in  the
      event, nothing much turns upon this, but I mention it to  explain  why
      the judge expresses  himself  in  the  plural  when  speaking  of  the
      appellants.

   3. The judge summarised the appellant's case as follows:

           "The basis of the appellants' claim under article 8 was that the
           first appellant was ill and required treatment within the United
           Kingdom  which  was  not  readily  available  in   Nigeria.   In
           particular, hospitals in Benin would  not  be  able  to  perform
           complicated heart surgery.

           It was further  contended  that  the  appellants  were  elderly,
           struggled to look after themselves and that they would  struggle
           to care for each other in Nigeria without support. They would be
           vulnerable to robberies, kidnapping and fraud  having  been  the
           victims of four armed robbers in the  past  and  fraudsters  who
           deprived the first appellant of his savings.

           It was stated that whilst in the United Kingdom the  appellants'
           children would pay for any private medical  treatment  that  the
           first appellant required and would provide personal care to  the
           appellants."

       And that of the respondent:

           "It  was  considered  that  these  matters  did  not  amount  to
           exceptional  circumstances.  The  respondent  referred  to   the
           country of origin report  indicating  that  there  were  several
           cancer organisations in existence in  Nigeria  and  that  cancer
           treatment  was  available  and  that  private  health  care  was
           available in Nigeria.

           The respondent further pointed out there was no reason  why  the
           appellant  could  not  apply  for  further  entry  clearance  to
           continue medical treatment on a private basis in the UK  and  or
           to  visit  his  family  in  the  UK.  There  were  therefore  no
           exceptional circumstances identified.

           It was considered that the second  appellant's  claim  stood  or
           fell with the first appellant's claim and leave to remain to the
           second appellant was also refused."

   4. The evidence before the judge was that the appellant suffered  from  a
      range of medical conditions. The  consultant  cardiologist,  Professor
      Kooner, said in a medical report dated 21 September  2015  (presumably
      prepared to inform and assist the application for further  leave  made
      on 23 September 2016):

           "Specifically, he  has  advanced  coronary  artery  disease  and
           sclerosis that requires surgery. He has a large renal stone that
           is on the verge of causing obstruction, additionally he has  on-
           going treatment with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

           He has recently developed quite severe limiting  back  pain  for
           which he is having imaging.

           He will be progressing on for coronary artery bypass surgery and
           aortic valve replacement.

           ...

           I suspect that he will require a further six months  in  the  UK
           and his treatment will be carried out privately since he is  not
           an NHS patient.

           I envisage the cost of treatment to be in the region of  �25,000
           to �30,000

   5. Despite that, it was confirmed in evidence given  by  the  appellant's
      daughter before the judge at the appeal hearing in March 2017 that the
      appellant had not received this treatment:

           "... she confirmed that her father had not received surgery  for
           his renal stone and no attempts had  been  made  to  reduce  the
           stone by means other than surgery. Further, he has not  received
           surgery for a coronary bypass as referred to [in the  report  of
           Professor Kooner]. He has not had the aortic valve  replacement.
           The treatment for  the  first  appellant's  prostate  cancer  as
           referred to in the letter  [from  the  physician  treating  that
           condition] has not been carried out. Apart from  receiving  drug
           therapy from his general practitioner  the  only  treatment  the
           first appellant has received whilst in the  United  Kingdom  has
           been a quarterly Depot injection of  Zoladex  for  his  prostate
           cancer."

   6. The judge recorded an acceptance by counsel for the appellant that the
      application made by the appellant was one that could not succeed under
      the immigration rules and that the  appeal  could  not  succeed  under
      articles 2 or 3 of the ECHR on grounds of ill-heath or  the  need  for
      medical treatment. The case for the  appellant  was  advanced  on  the
      basis that the appeal should  succeed  under  article  8  outside  the
      rules.

   7. In setting out his findings, the judge addressed  first  the  asserted
      need of the appellant to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  to  access
      medical treatment. The judge said that he was not persuaded  that  the
      appellant needed to remain for medical treatment. It was as  long  ago
      as 2 March 2015 that Professor Kooner said that the appellant required
      urgent aortic valve replacement, bypass surgery, removal  of  a  renal
      stone and radiotherapy for prostate cancer, but none of that treatment
      had been carried out apart from hormone treatment  for  his  prostate.
      The judge noted that the appellant had been admitted "as an emergency"
      to a hospital on 11 February 2017 but that he was discharged  promptly
      without having received any significant treatment. The judge observed:

           "Despite the letters suggesting quite  extensive,  invasive  and
           serious treatment none of this has  so  far  been  carried  out.
           There is little indication that it is going to be since no  date
           has been arranged.

           The sum total of the first appellant's treatment  since  he  has
           been in the United Kingdom is a  quarterly  Depot  injection  of
           Zoladex and the prescription of drug therapy as  listed  by  his
           general practitioner.

           ...

           I am not persuaded that the state of Nigeria private  healthcare
           is such that the appellant cannot obtain the treatment  that  he
           currently received in Nigeria ..... there has been no suggestion
           by the first appellant's doctors that the drugs that  the  first
           appellant currently receives are not available in Nigeria."

   8. Next, the judge considered the concern that had been  expressed  that,
      on return to Nigeria, the appellant and his  wife,  because  of  their
      vulnerability, would struggle to care for themselves. However, it  had
      been established that they own a house in Nigeria and in the past  had
      employed a security guard. There  was  no  reason  why,  if  one  were
      needed, they could not employ a housekeeper. If it were  necessary  to
      do so, one of the appellant's children could travel to Nigeria to  vet
      the appointment of such a person. In  reaching  that  conclusion,  the
      judge had regard to the  views  expressed  by  an  independent  social
      worker who had been commissioned to prepare a report but did not agree
      that it would be "cruel" for the Tribunal to reach a decision  on  the
      appeal that would have the effect of separating the appellant and  his
      wife from their adult children.

   9. The judge observed that the family life enjoyed between the  appellant
      and his wife and their adult children had been developed  while  their
      immigration status was precarious and that limited  weight  should  be
      given to private life  established  when  a  person  is  present  with
      precarious immigration status. He said:

           "I also bear in mind that  the  Supreme  Court  has  cited  with
           approval the ECJ decision in Jeunesse which also emphasises that
           family life developed  when  immigration  status  is  precarious
           attaches reduced weight."

      The judge found  also  that  the  appellant  and  his  wife  were  not
      financially independent and he doubted whether it was open to him,  as
      he was invited to do by counsel for the appeal, to allow the appeal on
      the basis that there must be no recourse to public funds."

  10. Drawing all of this together, the judge concluded that:

           "I am not persuaded that the first appellant's need for  medical
           treatment for his various illnesses is as acute as has been made
           out. The first appellant has not taken the opportunity  to  have
           any  of  the  surgical  procedures  identified  by  his  private
           physicians carried out.

           ... I accept also that the appellants  are  elderly  and  to  an
           extent vulnerable and that  they  will  be  more  vulnerable  in
           Nigeria than they would be in the United Kingdom. However,  this
           vulnerability  can  be  mitigated  by  the   employment   of   a
           housekeeper or carer in Nigeria.

           ... I am not  satisfied  that  the  appellants  are  financially
           independent...

           Whilst I accept the appellants have a  family  life  with  their
           children in the UK, for the  reasons  set  out  above  I  attach
           little weight to it in the balancing exercise...

           As for medical treatment in Nigeria, there are private hospitals
           in Nigeria, the treatment so far received... can be continued in
           Nigeria. I am not persuaded that the  more  extensive  and  very
           expensive treatment referred to... will be carried  out  in  the
           future. If it is carried out I am not persuaded that it will  be
           paid for on a private basis if leave to remain were granted...

           I am not persuaded that the  decision  is  disproportionate  set
           against the public interest in maintaining  immigration  control
           and ensuring the economic well-being of the country."

  11. Permission to appeal was sought on four grounds :

        i. As there  was  evidence  from  medical  professionals  that  the
           medical treatment described above still  needed  to  be  carried
           out, it was not rationally open to the judge to find  otherwise.
           Similarly, as paid invoices for medical treatment were provided,
           it was not reasonably open to the judge to find that any  future
           treatment would not be paid for.

       ii. The second ground, founded upon Paposhvili, was not  pursued  by
           Mr Walsh and I need say no more about that other  than  that  he
           was correct not to do  so  as  it  takes  the  appellant's  case
           nowhere at all.

      iii. The judge was wrong to consider that leave could not be  granted
           on the basis that there be no resort to public funds.

       iv. The judge fell into legal error if finding that little weight be
           given to family life developed while the appellant  was  present
           with a precarious immigration status.

  12. I shall address the submissions advanced by Mr Walsh in respect of the
      first, third and fourth grounds in turn.

  13. Mr Walsh pointed out that there was recent evidence before  the  judge
      explaining why treatment had been delayed. That was a letter dated  14
      March 2017 from Dr  Manger,  who  was  responsible  for  treating  the
      appellant's prostate cancer. He said that the appellant had  not  been
      given radiotherapy because he did not feel well enough to  receive  it
      because of his heart condition. But, although invited  to  do  so,  Mr
      Walsh was unable to identify anything  to  explain  why  the  surgical
      intervention to address the  heart  condition,  said  in  2015  to  be
      urgent, had not yet been carried out. Mr Walsh  pointed  also  to  the
      documentary evidence before the judge that  a  significant  number  of
      invoices for private medical treatment had been paid and that  one  of
      the appellant's children had in excess of �20,000 in a  bank  account.
      But I was not referred to anything in the evidence to show that  these
      funds had  been  earmarked  for  the  medical  treatment  said  to  be
      required, as and when it was delivered, and,  in  any  event,  it  was
      plainly open to the judge to find as a fact that the medical treatment
      for which the appellant had sought leave was not required urgently and
      that the treatment he in fact  was  receiving  could  be  provided  in
      Nigeria. Although some recent evidence  was  provided  that  the  more
      invasive treatment described above was still required,  the  delay  in
      providing it went largely  unexplained  and  this  provided  a  wholly
      rational basis for the conclusion reached by the judge.

  14. For these reasons, the first ground fails to identify any error of law
      by the judge.

  15. The third ground, that the judge was wrong to consider that it was not
      open to him to allow the appeal on the  basis  that  leave  should  be
      granted subject to a condition that  there  be  no  access  to  public
      funds, falls away with the failure to establish the first ground.  The
      judgment cannot be read in any way to indicate that but for  this  the
      judge would have allowed the appeal. Therefore, even if, which is  not
      established, it had been open to the judge to allow an appeal on  this
      basis, any such error is not conceivably material to  the  outcome  of
      the appeal.

  16. The final ground concerns the approach  taken  to  the  assessment  of
      family life in  the  striking  of  a  balance  between  the  competing
      interest in play for the purposes of article 8  of  the  ECHR.  It  is
      clear that the judge considered that the weight to  be  given  to  the
      family life between the  appellant  and  his  wife  with  their  adult
      children in the United Kingdom  was  reduced  because  that  had  been
      developed while  they  were  present  with  temporary  leave  with  no
      expectation of  settlement.  Two  points  are  made  in  the  grounds,
      specifically adopted by Mr  Walsh  in  his  oral  submissions.  First,
      section 117B(4) and (5) provide that little weight be given to private
      life or to a relationship with a qualifying partner established  while
      unlawfully present  of  whilst  present  with  precarious  immigration
      status but this does not apply to family life with adult children that
      was not created during the time of precarious leave. Family life  with
      the appellant's children  was  not  created  in  the  United  Kingdom.
      Secondly, it is said that the "special and compelling nature"  of  the
      family life in this  case  is  such  that  it  should  "override"  the
      presumption of s117B(5).

  17. Neither of those grounds is remotely arguable. The judge  was  plainly
      correct to have regard to the fact that the appellant was admitted  as
      a visitor and then secured further leave for  the  purpose  of  having
      medical treatment which, largely, he did  not  in  fact  receive.  The
      temporary nature of that leave  was  clearly  relevant.  Further,  the
      evidence before the judge of the nature of the assistance rendered  to
      the appellant by his children was not such as  to  establish  anything
      approaching the asserted exceptionality. In her witness statement,  Ms
      Aina Uduehi,  the  appellant's  daughter,  describes  herself  as  her
      father's "main carer". Her description  of  her  assistance  with  her
      father's daily routine, set out at paragraph 17 of  her  statement  at
      B26 of the bundle, discloses nothing that would be beyond  what  would
      be expected of a person such as the judge envisaged could be  employed
      in Nigeria. As for precariousness, Ms Ahmad referred to  the  reported
      decision Rajendran (s117B-family life) [2016] UKUT  00138  (IAT),  the
      headnote to which summarises the guidance given:

           1. That "precariousness" is a criterion of relevance  to  family
           life as well as private life cases is  an  established  part  of
           Article 8 jurisprudence: see e.g. R (Nagre) v SSHD  [2013]  EWHC
           720 (Admin) and Jeunesse v Netherlands, app.no.12738/10 (GC).

           2. The "little weight" provisions of s.117B(4)(a) and (5) of the
           Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 are confined  to  "
           private life" established by a  person  at  a  time  when  their
           immigration status is unlawful or precarious. However, this does
           not mean that when  answering  the  "public  interest  question"
           posed by s117A(2)-(3)  a  court  or  tribunal  should  disregard
           "precarious family life" criteria set out in established Article
           8 jurisprudence. Given that  ss.117A-D  considerations  are  not
           exhaustive, in certain cases it may be an error  of  law  for  a
           court  or  tribunal  to  disregard  relevant   public   interest
           considerations.

  18. As is generally the case with appeals against refusal to  grant  leave
      to remain on the basis of rights protected by article 8 of  the  ECHR,
      this was essentially a fact-based assessment  and  the  judge,  having
      heard oral evidence and received submissions was best placed to  carry
      out that task. It is impossible to conclude that any material  finding
      of fact made  by  the  judge  was  one  that  was  not  reasonably  or
      rationally open to him. When examined, the grounds amount to  no  more
      than an expression of disagreement  with conclusions that were clearly
      open to the judge in respect of which he has given legally  sufficient
      reasons.

   Summary of decision:

  19. First-tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald made no error of law, material  or
      otherwise, and his decision to dismiss the appeal is to stand

  20. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
