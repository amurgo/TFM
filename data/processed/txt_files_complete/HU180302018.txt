Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Mukulu (Amity Chambers)
For the Respondent:    Ms Holmes and Ms Cunha (Senior Presenting Officers)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Dezman Edwards, a citizen  of  Jamaica  born  7
       October 1969, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
       Thomas) of 28 December 2018 dismissing his  appeal  on  human  rights
       grounds, itself brought against the refusal of his human rights claim
       of 13 August 2018.

    2. The Appellant entered the UK in 2001 as a  visitor  and  subsequently
       overstayed his leave.

    3. He had lived in rented  accommodation  in  Jamaica,  working  in  the
       building trade, and had no permanent home there. One brother returned
       there in 2003 and was killed in 2011.

    4. The Appellant met his partner, [MM], a  British  citizen,  in  August
       2009, their relationship starting that October. He lacked evidence of
       their cohabitation as his immigration status prevented him  obtaining
       documents in his own name. The Sponsor feared  life  in  Jamaica  and
       refused to return there. Her son  [KT]  had  lived  with  them  since
       December 2010, and saw the Appellant  as  a  father  figure  with  an
       important role in his own life, his own father being in  Jamaica;  he
       gave evidence that the Appellant had had a  positive  impact  on  his
       mother's life.  She  was  in  full  time  employment  earning  �1,300
       monthly.

    5. The Secretary of State refused the application on the basis that  the
       Appellant had not demonstrated two years of cohabitation  to  qualify
       for the partner route,  had  overstayed  his  leave,  and  could  not
       demonstrate very significant obstacles  to  integration  to  life  in
       Jamaica.

    6. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the  relationship  between  the
       Appellant and Sponsor was genuine and subsisting. The test under  the
       Exception in the Rules required insurmountable obstacles to be shown,
       and there were none here: the Sponsor's objections to life in Jamaica
       were essentially matters  of  choice  due  to  the  difficulties  and
       upheaval that would ensue, and the Appellant would face  no  cultural
       and linguistic barriers to returning to a country where he had  lived
       for much of his life.

    7. Having regard to the statutory factors, the Appellant  spoke  English
       and had employable skills, and had lived in the UK apparently without
       recourse to public funds, all of which was in his favour  as  to  his
       integration. However his presence had consistently been over a period
       when his residence was precarious. He had not attempted to regularise
       his stay sooner, and there was no evidence to show any objective risk
       of suffering a similar fate to his brother.  Accordingly  the  appeal
       was dismissed.

Grounds of appeal and the error of law hearing

    8. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in
       law in vaguely referred to  the  Sponsor's  concerns  about  life  in
       Jamaica without further particularising them. The First-tier Tribunal
       granted permission to appeal on 18 January 2019 in the light of those
       grounds.

    9. At the April 2019 "error of law" hearing Mr Mukulu submitted  for  Mr
       Edwards  that  relevant  country  evidence   had   been   overlooked,
       particularly a report from the  Guardian  newspaper.  Risks  to  life
       demanded reasoned adjudication and could not be  dealt  with  by  the
       briefest of reasoning that treated the Appellant's Sponsor's fears as
       wholly uncorroborated.

   10. Ms Holmes replied that this was a short decision and  doubtless  that
       showed the Judge's style  was  one  of  concision.  Nevertheless  the
       essential point had been spotted and addressed.

  Findings and reasons - Error of law hearing

   11. The salient immigration rule in this appeal is the  Exception  within
       Appendix FM, addressing leave to remain for (overstaying) partners.

           "Appendix FM

           ...

           EX.1. This paragraph applies if ...

           ...

                (b)     the  applicant  has   a   genuine   and   subsisting
                relationship with a partner who  is  in  the  UK  and  is  a
                British Citizen, settled in the UK or in the UK with refugee
                leave   or   humanitarian   protection,   and   there    are
                insurmountable obstacles to family life  with  that  partner
                continuing outside the UK.

           EX.2. For the purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
           obstacles" means the very significant difficulties  which  would
           be faced by the applicant or their partner in  continuing  their
           family life together outside the  UK  and  which  could  not  be
           overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the applicant
           or their partner."

   12. So the Appellant needed to establish insurmountable obstacles to  the
       relocation of himself and his British citizen wife to  Jamaica,  this
       being a high threshold  equating  to  very  significant  difficulties
       entailing serious hardship.

   13. As set out above, there was in reality evidence before the First-tier
       Tribunal to the effect that British citizens  relocating  to  Jamaica
       could face a threat to their life or  well-being.  Yet  the  Tribunal
       concluded that "There is no evidence to show the Appellant or Sponsor
       is likely to suffer the same fate as his brother and or  innocent  UK
       settlers who were attacked." It  seemed  to  me  that  the  available
       evidence, published  as  it  was  in  a  national  newspaper  with  a
       reputation  for  journalistic  accuracy,   represented   sufficiently
       concrete evidence as to require reasoned  adjudication.  It  received
       none.

   14. I accepted following the error of law hearing that this represented a
       material error of law, and  so  it  was  necessary  to  complete  the
       determination of this appeal via a  further  hearing.  There  was  no
       challenge to the general fact-finding of the First-tier Tribunal; the
       real question was the proper inferences to be drawn from those facts.
       Given that the assessment of proportionality having particular regard
       to the  evidence  of  serious  harm  befalling  migrants  to  Jamaica
       represented a discrete issue as to which there is the need  for  only
       limited factual findings, I considered it appropriate for the  appeal
       to be retained for a continuation hearing in the Upper Tribunal.

Evidence at the Continuation hearing

   15. At the resumed evidence the Appellant gave evidence, saying that  his
       family was from Kingston. They had never lived anywhere else. He  had
       no family in other parishes in Jamaica; he had a brother [L] who  had
       been shot in Spanish Town. He did not think his partner would stay in
       Jamaica for any extended period; he  believed  her  family  had  once
       lived in Kingston and St Kathryn.

   16. Cross examined he said that he had learned of  [L]'s  death  after  a
       friend had contacted him. He did  not  have  any  medical  or  police
       report on the death. The police had not found find  the  perpetrators
       and had stopped investigating now. His parents had owned no  land  in
       Jamaica and had no problems with gangs. The Appellant  had  had  only
       one friend in Jamaica who was no longer there but had moved abroad.

   17. He had never worked in the UK and denied using any public  resources,
       he had never been to see a GP but had been to hospital for X-rays and
       blood tests; he took medication for his blood  pressure,  paying  the
       full price for those tablets. He used public  transport  though  paid
       for his own bus pass. Re-examined he said  that  he  had  never  been
       charged by the NHS.  He  had  had  no  police  report  regarding  his
       brother's death having had no contact with the police himself.

   18. The Appellant's partner gave evidence saying that  she  had  been  to
       Jamaica a few times on holiday; she had an older brother  there.  She
       would not say that she knew the country, she had only really been  to
       Kingston twice on holiday and she did not know  any  other  parishes.
       She felt that as soon as one came off the plane one would be seen  as
       a foreigner and thus at risk. She feared life in Jamaica as  she  had
       no support network and would just not be confident of navigating life
       there: it was not somewhere that she felt was her home. Other  people
       might  be  able  to  migrate  to  different  countries,  but  foreign
       nationals and returnees had been murdered in Jamaica and she did  not
       want to end up as a statistic.

   19. Cross examined she said that her relationship with the Appellant  had
       lasted since 2009. She knew that he was liable to return  to  Jamaica
       having understood that he was seeing a lawyer for a long time, though
       it was not until 2016 that she had really appreciated how significant
       the problems were, when a solicitor made him  come  and  collect  his
       paperwork. She earned �19,500 a year roughly. She would  sponsor  him
       if he wanted to return here, but it would then be very  difficult  to
       manage financially. She had  been  on  holiday  to  Jamaica  and  had
       enjoyed herself, but only in the context of staying on a compound  in
       an all-inclusive compound. She had no family there and was not  aware
       that the Appellant had any family there. If he lived there  then  she
       would doubtless return to visit him.

   20. For the Respondent it was submitted that the  Appellant  still  could
       not show that he had met the partner requirements of Appendix FM  and
       so had  to  meet  the  unjustifiably  harsh  threshold.  The  Sponsor
       retained sufficient links with Jamaica to  warrant  holidaying  there
       and could reasonably be expected to visit him there. They had pursued
       a relationship notwithstanding his precarious immigration status. The
       crime rate was not sufficiently high to put people at general risk of
       serious harm. This was a  long  term  overstayer  who  had  showed  a
       disregard for  immigration  control  and  had  not  established  very
       significant obstacles to integration in his country of  origin  where
       he could be presumed to retain  social,  cultural  and  family  ties.
       There was some reliance on public funds here and his  good  character
       was the least one  could  expect  from  a  foreign  national  present
       without leave. The government had taken various steps  to  develop  a
       protection  system  that  was  effective  to  the  international  law
       standard. The Secretary of State did not dispute the brother's  death
       but the circumstances were vague: one could not conclude  whether  or
       not he had been caught up in criminal activities himself.

   21. For the Appellant Mr Mukulu argued that the Appellant was  a  foreign
       national who would be at enhanced risk  of  serious  crime,  possibly
       even murder. The Secretary of State had adduced no evidence  such  as
       an unpaid bill to show that the Appellant was in debt to the NHS:  he
       had paid his NHS surcharge on the present application.   this  was  a
       genuine relationship that could not be conducted via modern means  of
       communication or otherwise remotely.

Findings and reasons - Continuation hearing

   22. The Respondent provided evidence by the way of the Country Policy and
       Information Note Jamaica: Fear of organised criminal groups  (Version
       3.0 August 2019)

           "3.3 Prevalence of organised crime.

           The USSD's  2018  Crime  and  Safety  Report  noted  that  'Most
           criminal activity is gang-related. Organized crime elements  are
           prevalent and extremely active. The same report  observed  that:
           'Police are unable to  patrol  and  protect  most  neighborhoods
           adequately, so burglaries are quite common. Home break-ins occur
           in Kingston, even in  gated  and  affluent  neighborhoods.  Past
           incidents have  shown  that  when  occupants  neglected  to  use
           security   features   provided,    criminals    were    afforded
           opportunities  to  gain  entry  into  residences.  Most  wealthy
           residents hire private, armed guard forces to  deter  criminals.
           Burglars can commit rape,  robbery,  and  assault  if  they  are
           surprised in a  home.  The  Bertlesmann  Stiftung  2018  Jamaica
           report stated: 'The state's monopoly on  the  use  of  force  is
           established nationwide in principle, but  it  is  challenged  by
           organized gangs  and  networks  involved  in  revenge  killings,
           fraud, and drugs and gun smuggling in parts of the capital city,
           Kingston, two rural parishes in central Jamaica  and  two  rural
           parishes in western Jamaica. There  were  targeted  killings  of
           police officers in summer 2015, the military has  been  deployed
           against drug gangs and murder rates are rising.  Meanwhile,  the
           security forces have been accused of human  rights  violations.'
           The report further added that:  'Jamaican  violence  has  become
           endemic among poor black communities. Violence is often directed
           against  other  members  of  the  same  class  not  for  ethnic,
           religious or political reasons but economic,  turf  or  domestic
           conflict  reasons.  'There  are  numerous   violent   incidents,
           reported by the police as occurring primarily between  organized
           gangs,  sometimes  within  a  community  or  between   different
           communities, mostly related  to  the  trafficking  of  guns  and
           drugs, and fraud.'  Furthermore, the Bertlesmann Stiftung report
           noted that young men 'are vulnerable to recruitment by organized
           gangs and criminal networks'.

           4.2 Other criminal activity

           According to the OSAC,  in  the  Jamaica  2019  Crime  &  Safety
           Report, 'Gangs are a major security issue across the country and
           are the source of the majority  of  violent  crime  nationwide.'
           Regarding kidnapping, the OSAC  2019  Crime  and  Safety  Report
           stated: 'Kidnappings can happen in any part of Jamaica;  a  wide
           range of criminals with varying levels  of  professionalism  and
           differing motives can execute kidnappings. At  one  end  of  the
           spectrum  are  high-end  kidnapping  gangs  that  target   high-
           profile/high-net-worth individuals. Such groups employ teams  of
           operatives who carry  out  specialized  tasks  (e.g.  collecting
           intelligence, conducting  surveillance,  snatching  the  target,
           negotiating with the victim's family, and  establishing/guarding
           safe houses). On the other end of the spectrum  are  gangs  that
           roam the streets and randomly  kidnap  targets  of  opportunity.
           These gangs are generally less professional, and often will hold
           a victim for a  short  period,  just  long  enough  to  use  the
           victim's ATM card to drain his/her  accounts  or  to  receive  a
           small ransom. Sometimes express kidnappers hold  victims  for  a
           couple of days if the victim has a large amount  in  a  checking
           account and a small daily ATM withdrawal limit...The FCO further
           added that 'Public order incidents and demonstrations can  occur
           across Jamaica, and may cause significant disruption to  traffic
           and public transportation. You should avoid all  demonstrations;
           they have the potential to turn violent and are  often  used  by
           criminals as cover for robbery and theft... Criminals are  known
           to use techniques which  distract  drivers  to  gain  access  to
           vehicles to steal handbags and other items of value.

           ...

           The  FCO  further  added  that  'Public  order   incidents   and
           demonstrations  can  occur  across  Jamaica,   and   may   cause
           significant disruption to traffic and public transportation. You
           should avoid all demonstrations; they have the potential to turn
           violent and are often used by criminals as cover for robbery and
           theft... Criminals are known to use  techniques  which  distract
           drivers to gain access to vehicles to steal handbags  and  other
           items of value.

           ...

           5. Organised gangs

           5.1 Number of gangs

           A report by the Jamaica Observer newspaper,  published  in  July
           2017, stated that a Jamaican pastor named 190 operating gangs on
           the island40. In an article published in February  2018  by  the
           Jamaican newspaper The Gleaner,  a  British-based  criminologist
           stated that there are over 200 gangs operating in Jamaica."

   23. The country evidence provided by the Appellant before the  First-tier
       Tribunal and Upper Tribunal collectively:

        a) The Jamaica 2019 Crime and Safety Report  from  OSAC  (the  U.S.
           Department of State Overseas Security Advisory Council);

        b) The Guardian  newspaper  report  of  June  2018  that  had  been
           overlooked by the First-tier Tribunal, titled Retirees returning
           to Jamaica face extreme murder risk, say  police  ...  Returnees
           warned they are seen as soft targets following multiple killings
           of UK expats.

   24. The OSAC report records a 21.9% fall from 1,647 in  murders  from  to
       1,287 from 2019 to 2018, and a fall in the numbers of shooting  on  a
       similar scale.

           "There is serious risk from crime in  Kingston.  Violent  crime,
           including  sexual  assault,  is  a  serious  problem  throughout
           Jamaica, particularly in Kingston  and  Montego  Bay.  Jamaica's
           police force is understaffed and has  limited  resources.  Gated
           resorts are not immune to violent crime.

           In 2017, Jamaica's homicide rate was 56 per  100,000;  in  2018,
           the homicide rate dropped to 47 per 100,000, but  remains  three
           times  higher  than  the  average  for  Latin  America  and  the
           Caribbean.

           ...

           Embassy personnel may not  travel  into  notoriously  high-crime
           areas of Kingston including, but not limited to  Mountain  View,
           Trench Town, Tivoli Gardens, Standpipe,  Cassava  Piece,  Grants
           Pen, and Arnett Gardens. In Montego Bay, Embassy employees  must
           avoid  Flankers,  Canterbury,  Norwood,  Rose  Heights,  Clavers
           Street, and Hart Street.  The  downtown  "Hip  Strip"  of  bars,
           clubs, and vendors in Montego Bay  is  an  area  where  tourists
           should remain aware of pickpockets and theft.

           In  Kingston,  Embassy  personnel  reside  in  several   housing
           compounds that have 24/7 armed guards. Residences must adhere to
           rigid security standards for  a  high-crime  crime  environment;
           each must be equipped with locked window grilles, alarm systems,
           and a safe room.

           Rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica,
           including at resorts and hotels.

           ...

           Crime Victim Assistance

           Local police assistance is  available  throughout  the  country.
           Police support for foreign victims of crimes varies between semi-
           responsive and responsive due to a shortage of labor,  training,
           vehicles, and resources. Police do not usually mistreat  victims
           of crime, but response times, investigation techniques, and  the
           arrest/conviction rates of  suspects  are  below  the  standards
           found in U.S. police departments."

   25. The Guardian report recounts:

           "Jamaican expats who retire there after decades in the  UK  face
           an "extreme risk" of  murder,  a  former  police  chief  on  the
           Caribbean island has said, as official figures revealed that  at
           least 85 Britons, Americans and Canadians have  been  killed  in
           the country since 2012.

           Senior police figures told the Guardian that returning residents
           were seen as soft targets by  criminals  and  needed  much  more
           protection following the murders of three  British  retirees  on
           the island in as many months.

           ...

           Percival Latouche, the president of the Jamaica association  for
           the resettlement of returning residents,  said  he  had  counted
           more than 200 British, American and Canadian expats murdered  in
           the country since 2000 and had attended  165  funerals  in  that
           time.

           Mark Shields, Jamaica's former deputy  commissioner  of  police,
           said returnees were seen as easy pickings by criminals, who  see
           them as wealthy and naive to the country's security risks. "I've
           always considered them to be an extreme risk," he  said,  adding
           that police chiefs had previously "under-appreciated" the  scale
           of the crime but that it was becoming a major issue. "There's  a
           significant risk to returning residents for robbery,  fraud  and
           the ultimate crime of murder," he said.

           Shields, who now runs his own security firm in Jamaica,  advised
           Jamaican  expats  to  "think  very  carefully  about   immersing
           themselves in local Jamaican culture in a rural  community  when
           they haven't been back that much".

           Some gangs are known  to  wait  until  retirees'  pensions  land
           before striking, while others tail  them  in  rental  cars  from
           Kingston or Montego Bay airports and rob them  once  they  reach
           their destination. Undercover police  officers  patrol  the  two
           airports on the  hunt  for  corrupt  baggage  handlers  or  taxi
           drivers, who have been known to tip off gangs about new arrivals
           returning to live in Jamaica.

           One such gang was led by a police officer and convicted  several
           years ago of 20 robberies, all  involving  returning  residents,
           although it was suspected of having committed many  more  crimes
           over the course of a  decade,  said  Cornwall  "Bigga"  Ford,  a
           former senior superintendent who  caught  the  group  before  he
           retired in 2015. "Once returning residents come back  they  need
           support. They need good support," Ford said. "They work so hard,
           buy these nice houses all over the place and some of the  places
           are remote. They need security, they  need  to  put  up  alarms,
           cameras and have dogs."

   26. One can readily see that  most  of  the  recorded  violence  has  two
       focusses. There is a very significant  amount  of  criminal  violence
       amongst gangs and the law enforcement authorities, including  revenge
       killings and targeted killings arising from turf wars. And there is a
       limited amount of crime which is targeted towards  those  expatriates
       who are  considered  to  be  worth  the  subject  of  extortion,  via
       kidnapping or otherwise. There is little or no  evidence  that  would
       raise a general risk to the average returnee who would  be  returning
       relatively anonymously - they would not  be  purchasing  a  desirable
       retirement home in a remote area which would  require  the  extensive
       security arrangements of which the former police deputy  commissioner
       spoke.

   27. I note the evidence that  police  support  for  "foreign  victims  of
       crimes" is variable but that statement is made in the context  of  US
       citizens travelling to Jamaica for diverse purposes (the OSAC  report
       effectively equates to the FCO advice regularly given by  the  UK  to
       British nationals) that do not necessarily equate with a person  with
       no particular profile settling there. I do not read that statement as
       inferring that a British citizen with a  Jamaican  partner,  both  of
       whom have some familiarity with the country and are  likely  to  have
       extended family there, would be unable to avail themselves  of  state
       protection.

   28. The Appellant and his partner would not fall into either category  on
       a return to Jamaica. There is no suggestion, to  their  credit,  that
       they have any gangland connections. They do not have any  significant
       financial  assets;  indeed  their  relative  shortage  of  funds   is
       something that is at the forefront of this appeal.

   29. The Secretary of State has not challenged the Appellant's account  of
       his brother's sad demise  at  the  hands  of  criminals  in  Jamaica.
       However, the account is very vague, and there is nothing therein from
       which one could infer any particular risks  eventuating  against  the
       Appellant and his partner some years later.

   30. Accordingly the only risks that they would arguably face  arise  from
       the generalised background violence. In fact the evidence provided to
       me from the Appellant today indicates a welcome decrease in the crime
       levels, though doubtless there is still a depressingly high amount of
       criminal violence. However I do not accept that this  amounts  to  an
       "insurmountable obstacle" to relocation abroad, or to  "unjustifiably
       harsh" consequences, to pose the test as posed  in  the  family  life
       context by  GEN.3.3  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  Citizens  of  many
       countries face much higher crime levels than are present in  the  UK,
       and British citizens regularly choose  to  live  in  countries  where
       policing and the institutions of government are less  well  developed
       than they are here. The Sponsor has effectively chosen to potentially
       join their ranks by contracting  a  relationship,  as  a  mature  and
       intelligent adult, with someone with no secure status in the UK. That
       is the policy that has been  enshrined  clearly  in  the  Immigration
       Rules since July 2012, and that has received very extensive  coverage
       in the media and, one imagines, within the communities where migrants
       are mostyb53 likely to situate themselves.

   31. That resolves the sole issue as to which this appeal was set down for
       a continuation hearing. However, I recognise that  the  Appellant  is
       entitled to an overall assessment of his  case,  notwithstanding  its
       previous failure, which folds the question of risks from  crime  into
       the other positive factors present in his case, which must  then  all
       be assessed against the public interest.

   32. The only route under the private  life  section  of  the  Immigration
       Rules under which the Appellant could (in theory) sustain a claim  is
       the "very significant obstacles to integration" proviso. However I do
       not consider he would face very significant obstacles to  integration
       in his country of origin. I infer from his evidence that he has lived
       amongst the Jamaican diaspora in the UK. He has  managed  to  sustain
       himself here for a significant period, apparently without working. He
       has no significant health problems. He may have no close family there
       but it is hard to accept he has no extended family to call upon;  and
       it seems probable that a person will have more than one friend  in  a
       country where they have lived for most of their life. He  is  clearly
       resourceful enough to survive amongst his fellow  nationals  were  he
       required to return to Jamaica.

   33. As to the Appellant's case outside the Rules (or at least for  family
       life purposes, under GEN.3.2 within  Appendix  FM  addressing  family
       life), I  accept  that  the  Appellant  will  have  established  some
       significant degree of private life in the United Kingdom  during  his
       lengthy residence here which demands respect. And of  course  he  has
       his genuine and prolonged relationship with  the  Sponsor.  Departing
       for another country  represents  a  serious  interference  with  that
       private and family life.

   34. The question remains as to whether  this  serious  interference  with
       private and family life is proportionate. One  must  acknowledge  the
       importance of maintaining immigration control and having a clear  and
       consistent system of rules by which the presence of visitors  to  the
       UK is regulated. The measure remains, absent any children from  their
       relationship, essentially whether there are insurmountable  obstacles
       posed by relocation abroad, or other exceptional factors amounting to
       unjustifiably harsh or disproportionate circumstances. I  cannot  see
       any such factors here. The Sponsor has lived in the  UK  for  a  long
       time of course and is accustomed to life here. But she has  evidenced
       no connections with this country that extend beyond the norm. Routine
       UK connections  by  way  of  family  and  friends  cannot  amount  to
       disproportionate consequences given the starting point identified  by
       the Immigration Rules, which  require  that  overstayers  demonstrate
       that the Ex.1 exception is established.

   35. As to the section 117B factors, the Appellant clearly speaks English.
       He is financially supported by his Sponsor. I take the point made  by
       his advocate that he has paid the Immigration Health  Surcharge,  and
       not been a great burden on the health service, but government  policy
       as enshrined in section 117B and  the  Immigration  Rules  especially
       aims to take account of the  burden  on  public  resources  that  any
       migrant foreseeably represents over time. One can  hardly  reside  in
       the UK for some eighteen years without working absent  some  recourse
       to the resources available to the community generally.

   36. Of course  the  Appellant's  residence  has  consistently  been  very
       precarious: one can hardly imagine a  more  precarious  basis  for  a
       person's residence than that presented by a long term overstayer  who
       only ever had a visit visa to enter the UK.  So overall  the  section
       117B factors count against him.

   37.  I  find  the  immigration  decision  is  not   disproportionate   to
       immigration control and the appeal is dismissed.

The appeal is dismissed.
