For the Appellants:    Ms C Grubb instructed by Hoole & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither  party  invited
    me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

Introduction

 2. The appellants are citizens of Turkey.  The first appellant was born on
    2 February 1980 and the second appellant was born on 14 February  2010.
    The second appellant is the son of the first appellant and 'AB' who has
    leave to remain  in  the  UK  as  a  businessperson  under  the  Ankara
    Agreement until 29 June 2015.

 3. On 13 December 2010, the first appellant was granted limited  leave  to
    enter the UK until 13 December 2012.  On 19 September 2012, she applied
    for leave to remain in order to establish herself in business under the
    Turkey  -  European  Community  Association  Agreement   ("the   Ankara
    Agreement").  On 8 April 2013, the Secretary of State refused the first
    appellant's application  and  that  of  the  second  appellant  as  her
    dependant.

 4. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a determination
    promulgated on 13 September  2013,  Judge  A  E  Walker  dismissed  the
    appellants' appeals.  Judge Walker was not satisfied that  it  was  the
    intention of the first appellant to establish  a  business  in  the  UK
    under the Ankara Agreement.  Consequently, Judge Walker dismissed  each
    of the appellants' appeals against a refusal to vary  their  respective
    leave. The judge noted that the appellants did not rely upon Art 8.

 5. In respect of the contemporaneous  decision  to  remove  the  appellant
    under s.47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006,
    applying Ahmadi [2012] UKUT 00147 (IAC), Judge  Walker  concluded  that
    those decisions were not in accordance with the law.

 6. The appellants sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  On 4
    November 2013, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Wellesley-Cole)  granted
    each of the appellants permission to appeal:  first, on the basis  that
    the judge had arguably erred in law in evaluating the first appellant's
    intentions to set up a business; and secondly, in failing  properly  to
    consider Art 8 of the ECHR.  Thus, the appeals came before me.

 7. It is common ground that the appeal of the second appellant is entirely
    dependent upon that of the first appellant.

The Claim under the Ankara Agreement

 8. The basis of the first appellant's claim for  leave  under  the  Ankara
    Agreement was that she intended to set up  a  business  as  a  cleaner,
    trading under the name of ZTB Cleaning.  In support of that, the  first
    appellant filed a business plan which stated that she expected to  draw
    �700 per month in salary She plans to use �2,000 of her  own  funds  to
    start up the business and anticipates a  monthly  turnover  of  �1,700.
    The first appellant  anticipates  a  gross  profit  of  �2,242  with  a
    dividend payable from net profit of �6,000 with surplus profits of �224
    carried forward.

 9. In support of her claim, the first appellant relied upon five "Cleaning
    Services Contracts" which are at pages 41-45 of the appellant's bundle.
     These are in identical terms but with different  establishments.   Two
    of the contracts, namely the "[A] Bar" and  the  "[BS]  Bar"  are  with
    establishments  of  which  her  brother  ('HT')  is  a  director.   The
    remaining three contracts are with  establishments  that  the  evidence
    shows were known to the first appellant's brother, HT.

10. In support of her appeal,  the  first  appellant  provided  a  detailed
    witness statement dated 22 August 2013  at  pages  2-7  of  the  appeal
    bundle; a witness statement from  her  husband  ('AB')  also  dated  22
    August 2013 at pages 8-9 of the bundle, and finally a witness statement
    from her brother, HT dated 28 August 2013 at pages 11-12 of the bundle.
     In addition, at the hearing before Judge Walker the  first  appellant,
    HT and AB gave oral evidence.  That evidence is set out  in  detail  at
    paras 24-27 of the determination.

11. The evidence of the first appellant dealt  with  a  number  of  matters
    arising  from  her  business  plan  and  the  proposed  contracts.   In
    particular, the first appellant gave evidence that she intended to work
    an eight hour day because that allowed her young  child  to  be  looked
    after by her husband.  She proposed to work between  6am  and  9am  for
    three hours and then again from 3pm until 8pm.  Her evidence  was  that
    the business was flexible.  She gave evidence that she intended to work
    for no more than 30 hours a week.  She intended to work at two  places,
    perhaps those run by her brother but it might also be two of the  other
    establishments.  She said that the contracts  did  not  spell  out  the
    amount she would be paid but there was  a  verbal  agreement  that  she
    would be paid �250 a week under  each  contract.   That  would  be  the
    equivalent of �500 a week with a per annum income of �26,000.   On  the
    basis of fifteen hours' work under each contract, it  was  pointed  out
    that this was equivalent of a rate of pay of �16.66 per hour.  She  was
    asked how this compared with other businesses and she said that all she
    knew was that her brother paid �250 and other places paid �260 and �270
    per week.  Her evidence was that she would clean as long as it took and
    she would be paid �250 per week for the work.

12. The first appellant's brother in his evidence confirmed that he  was  a
    local businessman and two of the contracts were with his companies  and
    three were by people he knew personally.  The contracts had been agreed
    with the first appellant;  no  hours  were  specified  because  it  was
    flexible as the establishment opened only limited hours.  He  explained
    that the way payment was made for cleaners was  for  the  job,  however
    long it took them to clean.  He  said  that  in  relation  to  his  two
    establishments - the [A] Bar and the [BS] Bar - he currently  paid  the
    cleaners �250 per week.  He said that he had no idea how long  it  took
    the cleaners to clean his establishment but he paid them  �250  however
    long it took.

13. The first appellant's husband also gave evidence and he said that  they
    had found out that a normal cleaner could earn  a  minimum  payment  of
    about �6.19 or �6.20 per hour.   He  said  that  his  wife  would  work
    between seven and eight hours a day and at a time so that he could look
    after their child and that he worked between 9am and 5pm seven  days  a
    week in his business.

14. In addition, all three witnesses gave evidence concerning a payment  of
    �10,000 made by the first appellant's father to  her.   This  had  been
    paid into her husband's account as she did not  have  a  bank  account.
    The first appellant had loaned to her brother  �8,000  initially.   The
    first appellant's brother said that he had "bought some  stuff  because
    in addition to his other work he is a  wholesaler  as  well."   He  had
    repaid that and had subsequently borrowed �2,000 which  had  also  been
    repaid.

The Judge's Decision

15. In paras 29 to 34 of her determination, Judge Walker  gave  her  reason
    for reaching her adverse finding in para 35 which was in the  following
    terms:

         "Taking into account my findings above I conclude  that  the  first
         appellant's business plan is  not  realistic  and  is  unlikely  to
         succeed and that its shortcomings reflect the reality that  she  is
         not intent on establishing her business in the UK under the  Ankara
         Agreement."

16. Judge Walker's reasons (at paras 29-34) were as follows:

         "29. I did not find the evidence  given  by  the  witnesses  to  be
             satisfactory.  At no point was  there  any  clear  explanation
             given as to why the first appellant's brother needed to borrow
             money for a short  term  loan  especially  when  this  is  set
             against his assertion that he employs over 100 people  and  is
             very successful.  It  is  clear  from  the  first  appellant's
             husband's bank account that the first appellant's brother  had
             to borrow a further �2,000 from the first appellant's husband.
              The first appellant's husband said that money tends  to  come
             and go  between  the  first  appellant  and  her  brother  and
             therefore if that pattern were to repeat itself in the  future
             the money available to the first appellant for  the  operation
             of her business  would  be  severely  curtailed.   However,  I
             accept that on her evidence the extent of her overheads  would
             be minimal because she plans, she says,  to  conduct  cleaning
             jobs near to her home  where  her  customers  supply  all  the
             necessary equipment and consumables.  Of the �12,260  expenses
             set against  profit in the business plan, �8,400 is said to be
             her wages.

         30.  I do not accept the assertion by the first appellant that  the
             cleaning services contracts supplied with the application  are
             examples.  This is because in each  case  the  contracts  have
             been signed by different people on behalf  of  the  client  in
             each case.

         31.  In her evidence it was apparent that the first  appellant  has
             no  clear  idea  of  the  hours  of  opening  of  the  various
             establishments that she intends to work for and  further  that
             she has no idea of how she could  fit  in  servicing  all  the
             establishments especially if it were to turn out that they had
             competing demands in terms of the hours that they  would  want
             her to clean.  She has no idea if she would be able  to  clean
             in the cocktail bar at 8pm at night for example.  Further  the
             first appellant's inability to ascribe rates  of  pay  to  her
             contracts is also not impressive.  I do not  accept  that  she
             had a verbal agreement as to how much she would earn from  the
             contracts  because  that  is  an  essential  element  of   any
             contract.  No sensible businessman would sign  a  contract  in
             which the cost to him of the contract is  left  out.   Equally
             the first appellant would not agree to undertake  work  for  a
             fixed price where she has no clear understanding of  how  much
             work there would be or how long it would take her to clean the
             premises.  The first appellant did not say that she understood
             precisely what she would be expected to  do  at  each  of  the
             premises.  The fact that the rate of pay of �250 per week  for
             the agencies, or �16.66 per hour based on  15  hours'  work  a
             week, is over 2.5 times the national minimum wage  is  such  a
             huge mark-up means  that  I  would  have  expected  the  first
             appellant to have investigated this thoroughly but in fact the
             first appellant relies, she says, on what her brother has told
             her he pays.  She was not able to say how  long  his  cleaners
             work in his premises in order to achieve that  level  of  pay.
             In addition I note that the contract  requires,  for  example,
             vacuuming the floors but it does  not  state  how  often  this
             should be done.  I consider that the first appellant's brother
             knew full well the importance of being able to demonstrate how
             much he pays for cleaning in  his  business  and  yet  he  had
             chosen not to produce this evidence at the hearing.

         32.  Further I find it  very  curious  that  the  clients  in  each
             contract have agreed to pay the first appellant in advance  of
             her work.  Overall I am not satisfied by these documents  that
             they represent any agreement between the first  appellant  and
             the supposed clients or that they have been arrived  at  as  a
             result of any proper or  careful  negotiation  or  exploration
             between the first appellant and the clients  and  I  therefore
             ascribe no weight to them in evidential  terms.   Further  the
             business plan is based on the existence of the  contracts  and
             accordingly I also discount that in terms of showing that  the
             first appellant is likely  to  establish  a  viable  business.
             Further,  it  seems  clear  the  contracts  rely  on  personal
             contacts.  Whilst there is nothing wrong  with  that  I  would
             still have expected the first appellant to have  entered  into
             discussions with the supposed clients  which  dealt  with  the
             essential elements such as her charging  rates  and  how  many
             hours she would be expected to work for each client.  The fact
             that these elements were left out of the contracts leads me to
             the conclusion that the first appellant has  no  intention  of
             establishing a business in the UK.

         33.  The first  appellant's  brother's  assertion  that  the  first
             appellant would be able to clean his premises for  3  hours  a
             day makes no sense because this would equate  to  21  hours  a
             week on the basis of a 7 day week (the level  of  cleaning  he
             said he has at the moment) and the first appellant  said  that
             she does not want to work more than 30 hours a  week  and  yet
             none of the other contracts allow for her doing anything  than
             a full cleaning job.  Therefore it follows that she would have
             to do one contract in 9 hours a week which is  not  consistent
             with her evidence of the amount of hours she would  expect  to
             spend at her second contract.  Further  the  evidence  of  the
             first appellant's husband that she would earn �6.19  or  �6.20
             an hour is inconsistent with the  first  appellant's  evidence
             and is inconsistent with the business plan.

         34.  I find the first appellant's assertion that she  wants  to  do
             something on her own contradicts the fact that  she  does  not
             have a bank account even  a  bank  account  jointly  with  her
             husband so that even when her father sends her money it has to
             be paid to her husband."

The Submissions

17. In her skeleton argument and oral submissions, Ms Grubb submitted  that
    the judge had made her finding based on the following (see para 12):

         "a)  The proposed clients were personal contacts [para 32].

            b)    The written agreements were not  comprehensive  [paragraph
             31].

             i.   The Appellant had not provided details of hourly rates of
                  pay [paras 31 onwards].

             ii.  She had  not  given  clear  evidence  on  the  times  she
                  proposed to carry out her work [para 33].

           c) She does not have her own bank account [para 34]."

18. Ms Grubb submitted that Judge Walker had imposed too  high  a  test  in
    scrutinising the first appellant's business  plan,  her  contracts  and
    evidence about her proposed business.  She  relied  upon  [19]  of  the
    Upper Tribunal's decision in Akinci (Para 21 HC 510 - correct approach)
    [2012] UKUT 00266 (IAC) where it was stated:

         "Whilst the suggested evidence to be  provided  in  support  of  an
         application is useful as a means to satisfy the Secretary of  State
         of the application, the expectation that  the  applicant  'is  able
         convincingly  to  demonstrate  an  understanding  of  any   written
         evidence' sets the standard too high and  does  not  represent  the
         approach applied in 1972 which his the acid test.  An applicant may
         have a clear idea  of  what  he  plans  to  do  but  may  not  have
         sufficient sophistication to explain the way  in  which  his  ideas
         have been expressed by a business advisor.  He does not have to  be
         a financial expert and in a case of  doubt,  clarification  can  be
         provided if needed and the advisor can be called to  give  evidence
         if matters are in doubt."

19. Ms Grubb submitted that the relevant Immigration Rule was para 21 of HC
    510  which,  by  virtue  of  the  'standstill  clause'  in  the  Ankara
    Agreement, applies in cases of this sort.  Under that  Rule,  the  only
    relevant issue  before  the  judge  was  whether  the  first  appellant
    genuinely intended to pursue the establishment of a business in the UK.
     Ms Grubb  referred  me  to  the  Tribunal's  decision  in  EK  (Ankara
    Agreement - 1972 Rules - construction) Turkey [2010] UKUT 425 (IAC)  at
    [23]-[24]  where  the  Upper  Tribunal  sets  out  the  "open  textured
    exercise" required under the 1972 Rules as follows:

         "23. In 1973 the Rules themselves were an open textured exercise in
             discretion in the round having regard to  the  general  policy
             and particular factors indentified; so  was  the  practice  in
             applying them ...

         24.  ... It was certainly the case in 1972  and  for  a  number  of
             years thereafter  that  the  Home  Office  recognised  that  a
             business often needed some time to turn a profit and losses in
             the early years were not inconsistent with the  business  that
             met the policy and purpose of the Rules in general.  The  case
             was always considered in the  round.   In  cases  of  doubt  a
             further extension of limited leave was often given".

20. Ms Grubb submitted that the judge's reasoning had  scrutinised  at  too
    high a degree the first appellant's business plans  and  contracts  and
    had, as a result, lost sight of whether she had a genuine intention  to
    establish the business even if some of the detail was omitted and  even
    if her plan was not realistic.

21. In that latter regard Ms Grubb referred me to the head note  in  Akinci
    where at [v] the Upper Tribunal stated:

         "A plan is what  it  says  it  is:   a  projection  of  how  it  is
         anticipated things will work  out  with  a  possibility  of  making
         adjustments as the business gets underway.   It  is  not  a  strait
         jacket."

22. Ms Grubb submitted that it was wrong in  principle  for  the  judge  to
    subject the business plan to  a  detailed  scrutiny,  conclude  it  was
    unrealistic and on that basis find against the first appellant having a
    genuine intention of establishing the business.

23. As regards the detailed points raised by the judge, Ms Grubb  submitted
    that it was not crucial that the contract did not provide for a  price.
    A contract could be both oral and written and the  evidence  was  clear
    that the agreement was that the first appellant would be paid �250  per
    week for cleaning each establishment.

24. Secondly, the judge was wrong in principle to require every  detail  to
    be included in these contracts which were purely evidence of  potential
    customers and gave a rough detail of the  framework  within  which  the
    first appellant was to supply her services.

25. Thirdly, Ms Grubb submitted that the judge was wrong to form an adverse
    assessment on the basis of inconsistencies (as the judge saw  them)  in
    the hourly rate to be paid.  The evidence  of  all  the  witnesses  was
    clear:  the first appellant was to be paid not on an hourly rate but on
    a fixed fee consistently with other contracts for cleaning services.

26. Fourthly, Ms Grubb submitted that it was wrong for the judge to draw an
    adverse inference from the fact that the appellant did not have her own
    bank account as she was a  visitor  and  there  was  nothing  wrong  in
    principle in her using her husband's account.

27. Fifthly, Ms Grubb submitted that there was nothing wrong  in  principle
    in the first appellant  making  contacts  on  the  basis  of  "personal
    contacts".  Finally, Ms Grubb submitted that the judge  had  failed  to
    take into account that the first  appellant  already  had  leave  as  a
    dependant of her husband and that  there  was  no  reason  for  her  to
    fabricate this claim in order to obtain leave to remain in the UK.

28. Mr Richards submitted that the judge had taken  into  account  all  the
    evidence and the weight to be given to each piece of that evidence  was
    a matter for her unless, which he submitted was not the case, she  gave
    perverse or irrational weight to it.  He submitted that the  judge  was
    entitled to conclude that the  appellant's  evidence  was,  in  effect,
    vague, contradictory  and  unrealistic  in  relation  to  the  proposed
    business and then to  conclude  that  those  shortcomings  reflect  the
    reality that it was not the first appellant's  intent  to  establish  a
    business in the UK.  He submitted that whilst some might disagree  with
    that conclusion, it was one open to the judge and not one arrived at on
    the basis of an error of law.

Discussion

29. It is common ground that the relevant Immigration Rule is para 21 of HC
    510.  That provides as follows:

         "Businessmen and self-employed persons

         People admitted as visitors  may  apply  for  the  consent  of  the
         Secretary of State to their establishing themselves  here  for  the
         purpose of setting up in business, whether on their own account  or
         as partners in a new or existing business.  Any such application is
         to be considered on merits.  Permission will depend on a number  of
         factors, including evidence that the  applicant  will  be  devoting
         assets of his own to the business, proportional to his interest  in
         it, that he will be able to bear his share of any  liabilities  the
         business may incur, and that his  share  of  its  profits  will  be
         sufficient to support him and any dependants.  The applicant's part
         in the business must not amount to  disguised  employment,  and  it
         must be clear that he will not  have  to  supplement  his  business
         activities by employment for  which  a  work  permit  is  required.
         Where the applicant intends to join an existing  business,  audited
         accounts should be produced to establish  its  financial  position,
         together with a written statement of the terms on which  he  is  to
         enter into it; evidence should be sought that he will  be  actively
         concerned with its running and that there is a genuine need for his
         services and investment.  Where  the  application  is  granted  the
         applicant's stay may be extended for a period of up to  12  months,
         on a condition restricting  his  freedom  to  take  employment.   A
         person admitted as a businessman  in  the  first  instance  may  be
         granted an appropriate extension of stay if the conditions set  out
         above are still satisfied at the end of the period for which he was
         admitted initially."

30. In Akinci, where a person proposes to set themselves  up  in  business,
    the Upper Tribunal stated that the Rule is:

         "expressed in broad terms in the context of an  approach  that  any
         application is to be considered on its merits." (see [14]).

31. At [14], the Upper Tribunal summarised the factors  which  have  to  be
    considered as follows:

         "Permission is stated to  depend  on  a  number  of  factors  which
             include:

         i.   evidence that the applicant will be devoting assets of his own
             to the business, proportional to his interest in it;

         ii.  that he will be able to bear his share of any liabilities  the
             business may incur;

         iii. that his share of its profits will be  sufficient  to  support
             him and any dependants;

         iv.  the applicant's part  in  the  business  must  not  amount  to
             disguised employment;

         v.   and it must be clear that he will not have to  supplement  his
             business activities by employment for which a work  permit  is
             required."

32. At [21(ii)] the Upper Tribunal noted that under para 21 of HC 510:

         "A business plan must be realistic having regard to the  nature  of
         the enterprise.  It is legitimate to ask  further  questions  where
         the projected turnover is substantially greater than that reflected
         in the accounts of a business being acquired."

33. Ms Grubb submitted that that statement was made in the  context  of  an
    individual who was seeking to acquire  or  join  an  existing  business
    where the business plan could be assessed against the  accounts  of  an
    existing business.  However, that point was of less potency  where  the
    individual was setting up, for the  first  time,  a  new  business.   I
    accept that the viability of a business plan is  a  factor  even  in  a
    case, such as this, where a business is being established for the first
    time.  However, it is clear from both EK and Akinci and the passages to
    which I have referred above, that a flexible approach  is  required  in
    assessing the evidence.

34. In this case, I accept Ms Grubb's submission that  the  judge  has,  in
    effect, imposed too high an assessment  criterion  as  a  yardstick  to
    assess the evidence  concerning  the  appellant's  business  plans  and
    contracts.   That,  in  my  judgment,  is  particularly   so   in   the
    circumstances of this appeal where the contracts  are  with  the  first
    appellant's brother where, perhaps, a more informal  arrangement  could
    be expected.  The high standard is clear from the judge's words used in
    para 32 of her  determination  that  she  did  not  accept  that  these
    documents:

          "Represent any agreement  between  the  first  appellant  and  the
         supposed clients or that they have been arrived at as a  result  of
         any proper or careful negotiation or exploration between the  first
         appellant and the clients." (My emphasis).

35. First, the judge was wrong, in my view, to doubt the genuineness of the
    contractual arrangement simply on the basis that the fee to be paid  to
    the first appellant was not contained within the written contract.  The
    evidence before the judge was clear  from  all  the  witnesses  that  a
    verbal agreement had been made, consistent with existing  practice  and
    the market, that the appellant would be paid a fixed fee of �250.   Its
    absence from the  standard  written  contract  was  not,  in  my  view,
    properly to be seen as suspicious.

36. Secondly, the first appellant  was  candid  that  some  of  the  detail
    remained to be worked out if she  obtained  permission  to  work.   The
    first appellant's evidence was that she had  first-hand  experience  of
    the cleaners at one of her brother's establishments  where  she  lived.
    The fact that she had not yet determined the details of when or for how
    long she would work was entirely explicable.

37. Thirdly, the judge's reliance upon the fact that  the  first  appellant
    did not know what hourly rate she would be  paid,  that  the  rate  was
    (calculated at �250 per week for fifteen hours' work)  over  2.5  times
    the national minimum wage and that her husband's evidence was that  she
    would earn less  than  this,  namely  �6.19  or  �6.20  per  hour,  was
    insufficient to doubt the genuineness of her endeavour.   The  evidence
    of the first appellant and other witnesses was that this kind  of  work
    was paid on a fixed fee basis of �250 per week.   That  was  the  going
    rate for cleaning establishments  such  as  that  owned  by  the  first
    appellant's brother.  Whatever the hourly rate that worked out as,  was
    neither here nor there, even if it was 2.5 times the  national  minimum
    wage.  There was no evidence before the judge, other than the  evidence
    of the going rate based upon a fixed fee for cleaning an  establishment
    per week, on which the judge could call into question the  amount  paid
    to the first appellant.  Whilst the oral evidence  of  the  appellant's
    husband was that the "minimum payment" a normal cleaner would earn  was
    between �6.19 and �6.20 per hour and he thought that is what the  first
    appellant would earn, that evidence had, again, to be seen in the light
    of the evidence of all the witnesses as to the fixed fee that the first
    appellant had agreed, and which was the going rate,  for  cleaning  the
    relevant establishments.  At worst, it merely suggests that  the  first
    appellant may have underestimated the amount of time required to  clean
    each establishment which would, in turn, have affected the hourly  rate
    based upon that fixed fee.

38. Finally, it was, perhaps, relevant that the appellant did not have  her
    own bank account, given her evidence that she wished to do something on
    her own.  However, in doubting the genuineness of the first appellant's
    intentions, if this was to be an adverse factor, the judge was required
    to grapple with the appellant's circumstances in the  UK,  namely  that
    she was still a visitor and (at least for the present)  had  no  reason
    necessarily to have a separate bank account.  In any event,  this  fact
    cannot rationally in itself shed much light on  the  first  appellant's
    intention.

39. For these reasons, therefore, the judge erred in law in  assessing  the
    evidence of the first appellant's business plan and factors relevant to
    her establishing a cleaning business in the UK.  Her finding  that  she
    was not satisfied that the first  appellant  intended  to  establish  a
    business in the UK was, for these reasons, flawed and cannot stand.

Re-making the Decision

40. At the conclusion of the submissions in relation to  error  of  law,  I
    invited the representatives to make  any  submissions  on  how,  if  it
    became relevant, I should remake the decision.

41. Ms Grubb relied upon the skeleton argument that  had  been  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and, in  addition,  she  relied  upon  four  "self-
    billing invoices" which indicated that a named individual had been paid
    amounts varying between �257.50 and �280 by "[BB] Limited".   Ms  Grubb
    indicated that these were invoices  showing  payments  to  cleaners  in
    respect of one of the establishments that the first appellant  proposes
    as a potential client.  She indicated that the amounts varied  to  take
    into account that, on occasions, cleaners consume drinks whilst working
    and the costs of these were deducted from the payments.

42. Mr Richards accepted that there was evidence that the  first  appellant
    was someone who intended to set up a business.  He  submitted  that  if
    the contrary reasons, relied upon by Judge Walker, fell away, then what
    was left was the evidence relating to the first  appellant's  intention
    to establish the business.  He did not make any submissions inviting me
    to dismiss the appeal under para 21 of HC 510.

43. The burden of proof is upon the  first  appellant  to  establish  on  a
    balance of probabilities that she meets the requirements of para 21  of
    HC 510.  The only issue under para 21 which has been  disputed  by  the
    respondent is whether the first appellant  has  established  a  genuine
    intention to set up a business.

44. Mr Richards did not seek, in his submissions, to challenge the evidence
    that was before the First-tier Tribunal in  the  form  of  the  witness
    statement and oral evidence of the first appellant, her brother and her
    husband. I see no reason to doubt it.

45. Approaching the evidence, I bear in mind the importance of  looking  at
    the evidence of the first appellant's business plans and contracts in a
    flexible way.  I accept that the written contract may not, necessarily,
    cover every detail of the planned delivery of  services  by  the  first
    appellant.   I  bear  in  mind  that  it  is  her  intention,  in   all
    probability, to provide the  services  at  establishments  run  by  her
    brother or by his friends.  An element of  informality  might  well  be
    expected in such circumstances.  I see no reason to  doubt  the  common
    evidence of the witnesses that the agreement (made orally) is that  the
    first appellant will be paid �250 per week as a fixed fee for  cleaning
    the relevant establishments.  The first appellant has witnessed  first-
    hand cleaners working within her brother's establishments.  It may well
    be that the precise times at which she will provide  the  services  and
    how long it will take to clean each establishment remains a  detail  to
    be worked out when she begins her work.  That too may be expected.  The
    first appellant has produced a business plan and a number of  contracts
    to support her proposed business.  She has also incorporated a  limited
    company on 8 August 2012, "ZTB Cleaning Services Limited".  I also bear
    in mind that the first appellant already has leave to remain in the  UK
    and, perhaps more importantly, would continue to have leave  (as  would
    the second appellant) as the dependant of her husband who  himself  has
    leave under the Ankara Agreement.  There was no  suggestion  before  me
    that the first appellant's husband's leave would not  continue  on  the
    basis of his continued business activity.

46. Taking all the evidence into account, I am satisfied on  a  balance  of
    probabilities  that  the  first  appellant  has  a  genuine  intent  to
    establish  a  business  in  the  UK,   namely  one  providing  cleaning
    services.  Given that no other matters under para  21  of  HC  510  are
    disputed by the respondent, I am satisfied  that  the  first  appellant
    meets the requirements of para 21 of HC 510 and is entitled to leave to
    remain on that basis.

Article 8

47. In the light of that finding, it is not strictly necessary  for  me  to
    consider Art 8 of the ECHR.  Despite  Ms  Grubb's  submissions,  it  is
    clear that Art 8 was not relied upon before Judge Walker.   It  is  not
    referred to in the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, nor in
    her skeleton argument upon which she relied before Judge  Walker.   Put
    shortly, Art 8 was not a ground of appeal and, in those  circumstances,
    Judge Walker did not err in law in failing to consider  Art  8  of  the
    ECHR.

Decision

48. For the above reasons, the First-tier Tribunal decision to dismiss  the
    appeal under para 21 of HC 510 involved the making of an error of  law.
    Its decision cannot stand and I set it aside.

49. I remake the decision, allowing the first appellant's appeal (and  that
    of the second appellant as her dependant) under para 21 of HC 510.
