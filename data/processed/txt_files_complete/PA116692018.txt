Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mutuambrudewa (For Immigration Advice Service)
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Ameanah [S], a citizen of Iraq, born [~]  1984,
       against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal signed on 9  December
       2018 dismissing her appeal, itself brought against the refusal of her
       human rights and asylum claims of 10 September 2018.

    2. She arrived in the UK by air  from  Italy  on  30  January  2017  and
       claimed asylum on arrival, that application being refused on 26  July
       2017. She lodged further submissions which were recognised as a fresh
       asylum claim and refused on 10 September 2018.

    3. Her asylum claim can be summarised thus. She is a  Sunni  muslim  who
       lived in Karada, Baghdad. In 2007 her husband and brother were killed
       by explosions. Her mother died similarly in December 2016. She  lived
       opposite a member of  the  Badr  organisation,  who  had  significant
       security and protection arrangements  in  place;  she  felt  that  he
       attracted  adverse  attention  which   contributed   to   the   local
       insecurity. She complained to the  neighbours  about  the  situation,
       which led to problems for her. She received a handwritten note  on  4
       January 2017 telling her to leave the area or be  removed.  She  left
       Baghdad with her father and two  children,  and  went  to  the  Iraqi
       Kurdistan region, where they transited Sulaymaniyah before  she  left
       the rest of her family in a refugee camp in Dohuk.

    4.  At  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  Appellant
       explained that her sister had subsequently taken  the  children  from
       the camp and they now lived with her.  She  felt  unable  herself  to
       return to live with her sister given the  threats  she  had  received
       from the Badr group. She had begun her relationship with her  husband
       in the UK, Mr [AS], via Facebook, on 28 March 2016.

    5. Mr [AS] gave evidence, explaining that he could not return to Iraq as
       he had nobody there; he had previously  been  married,  but  was  now
       divorced and had two children. He had not planned for her to join him
       in the UK.

    6. The First-tier Tribunal did not believe the  Appellant's  account  of
       her problems in Iraq because

        a) She had referred to receiving threats from January  2017,  which
           was after her mother's death in an explosion;

        b) She was able to give no details regarding the Badr official  who
           was  the  source  of  the  neighbourhood's  problems,  had  made
           comments to the neighbours that simply appeared  to  be  general
           complaints about the risks of violence there, and in  any  event
           it was not plausible that the Badr group would target  the  area
           with bombs if a well known supporter lived in the area;

        c) She had  variously  suggested  the  handwritten  note  had  been
           delivered in January and November 2016;

        d) It was supposition on her part to presume  that  the  Badr  were
           responsible for the note given it was not plausible  that  other
           groups could not enter the area, and  it  was  also  implausible
           that she would flee her home area having lived there safely  for
           so  long,  or  that  she  would  abandon  her  children  in   an
           overcrowded refugee camp with her 85-year old father.

    7. Overall the First-tier Tribunal concluded that it was likely that the
       account was an invention, designed to obscure the fact that  she  had
       travelled to the UK with a view to joining her now husband here.  The
       fact that the refusal letter apparently conceded that  the  Appellant
       could not be returned to Iraq did  not  make  good  an  international
       protection. In reality there was no explanation as to why she  lacked
       identity  documents  now;  her  statement  that  she  had  held  them
       previously  in  Iraq  but  they  had  subsequently  been   lost   was
       unexplained, and in reality the Judge believed her  sister  would  be
       able to recover them for her.

    8. The Judge accepted that the Appellant was  married  to  Mr  [AS].  It
       considered he had dissembled when he denied having visited Iraq:  his
       passport showed a stamp for Irbil, in the North of Iraq, and he could
       not reasonably have understood himself not to have travelled to Iraq.
        Accordingly false representations had been made in  support  of  the
       partner claim which rendered the Appellant unsuitable for  the  route
       in question.

    9. As to whether or not  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
       Sponsor's relocation to Iraq, it was not accepted that he had contact
       with his own two children in the UK, as no  contact  order  or  other
       objective information had been provided in relation to them.  He  was
       of Iraqi heritage, spoke Arabic, and had presumably not lost cultural
       ties with Iraq. His UK skills would help him to integrate and work on
       return. The child's best interests were to remain with  his  parents;
       whilst ideally he would have access to his British citizenship rights
       in the UK, the reality of the situation was that his mother  was  not
       entitled to reside here.

   10. Outside the Immigration Rules, the statutory factors were against the
       couple: the Appellant did not speak English, had  been  a  burden  on
       public funds (exemplified by her  use  of  the  NHS  to  support  her
       child's birth here), and had circumvented the entry  clearance  route
       via a false asylum claim, and thus formed a relationship in the UK in
       precarious circumstances. She should have applied for entry clearance
       as a partner from abroad.

   11. Grounds of appeal contended  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  was
       legally flawed because

        a) The Judge was wrong to hold it against the  Appellant  that  she
           had not written off the risks posed by  daily  explosions  as  a
           commonplace occurrence in Iraq,  and  furthermore  to  count  it
           against her that she acted as a responsible  mother  in  leaving
           her children in a refugee camp when she felt they were in danger
           in their home area;

        b)  The  Sponsor  had  made  an  honest  mistake   to   which   his
           representatives may have contributed as to whether or not he had
           travelled to a part of Iraq, and the Judge had  made  a  finding
           without evidential foundation in  presuming  the  Sponsor  would
           return to Iraq with the Appellant given he had  expressly  ruled
           out any possibility that he would do so, meaning that  her  case
           necessarily fell to be assessed on the basis that she would be a
           vulnerable female who might face suspicions  of  adultery  on  a
           return to Iraq;

        c) The Judge had failed to apply the appropriate test as  to  where
           the Appellant's child's best interests lie.

       I have paraphrased those grounds somewhat in order to make  sense  of
       them; as  drafted,  they  bore  little  correlation  to  a  challenge
       predicated on identifying a material error of law.

   12. The Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 14  January  2019,
       on the basis that it appeared that material  evidence  regarding  the
       use of night letters had been overlooked.

   13. Before me Mr Jarvis for the  Secretary  of  State  took  a  pragmatic
       stance, explaining that there  were  clearly  difficulties  with  the
       reasoning  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Whilst  the  approach   to
       credibility was perfectly defensible, there was a real  issue  as  to
       whether the proper approach had  been  taken  to  a  British  citizen
       child. Once it was  recognised  that  a  British  citizen  child  was
       involved in the case, then it was essential to at least  have  regard
       to the Home Office policy that made it clear that a  British  citizen
       child should not be  expected  to  leave  the  UK,  a  position  that
       arguably extended beyond the Zambrano situation,  particularly  given
       the approach now struck by the Upper Tribunal regarding  hypothetical
       removals. Mr Mutuambrudewa acknowledged that it would be difficult to
       demonstrate any error of law in the credibility findings, and  agreed
       with Mr Jarvis's position as to the treatment of the British  citizen
       child.

  Findings and reasons - Error of law hearing

   14. At the hearing listed to identify whether there was an error of  law,
       I accepted that there was indeed a material error of law in the First
       Tier Tribunal's decision on this appeal.

   15. As already noted, the grounds of appeal fell far short of what should
       be expected in measured pleadings aiming to identify a material error
       of law. The challenges to the fact-finding of the First-tier Tribunal
       were wholly discursive. I did not consider that any material error of
       law was established in the approach to the  Appellant's  credibility.
       The Judge's findings below were perfectly open to them, given that no
       material evidence was overlooked and  adequate  reasons  were  given.
       Indeed, given the sparse facts put forward and the overall chronology
       of the case, the conclusions were wholly unsurprising.

   16. However, the First-tier Tribunal did err  in  its  treatment  of  the
       British citizen child. To  simply  state  that  the  child  could  be
       expected to move abroad (contrary to the Tribunal's finding as to its
       best interests) with its parents gave no attention whatsoever to  the
       Home Office policy position on British citizen children  nor  to  the
       special value of British citizenship as  recognised  on  the  highest
       authority.

   17.  Firstly,  the  Appellant's  child's  nationality  is  of  particular
       importance because it brings into play  considerations  going  beyond
       those present, for example, in the case of a foreign  national  child
       who has established seven years of residence in the UK. As was  noted
       by Baroness Hale in ZH  [2011]  UKSC  4  relevant  considerations  in
       removing a British citizen child include the potential deprivation of
       the practical benefits of that citizenship, "and  of  its  protection
       and support, socially, culturally and medically, and  in  many  other
       ways evoked by, but not confined to, the broad concept of lifestyle."
       However, these distinct benefits of British citizenship  were  simply
       not considered at all.

   18. Secondly, there is the  Home  Office  policy  position.  Tracing  the
       progression of Home Office Guidance on British  citizen  children  is
       not an easy task  as  it  changes  surprisingly  often  and  historic
       versions are not  readily  accessible.  The  Immigration  Directorate
       Instruction - Family Migration - Appendix FM, Section 1.0(B)  "Family
       Life as a Partner or Parent and Private Life, 10 year Routes" in  the
       course of 2018 posed the question:

           "Where the child is a British citizen, it will not be reasonable
           to expect them to leave the UK  with  the  applicant  parent  or
           primary carer facing removal. Accordingly, where this means that
           the child would have to leave the UK because, in  practice,  the
           child will not, or is not likely to, continue to live in the  UK
           with another parent or primary  carer,  EX.1.(a)  is  likely  to
           apply."

   19. It will be seen that this represents a  statement  of  public  policy
       that appears wider in ambit than the Zambrano principle.  Having  had
       regard to a predecessor of this Guidance, in SF Albania  [2017]  UKUT
       120 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal stated �13:

           "10.  ... it appears to us that the terms of the guidance are an
           important source of the Secretary of State's view of what is  to
           be regarded as  reasonable  in  the  circumstances,  and  it  is
           important in our judgement for the Tribunal at  both  levels  to
           make decisions which are, as far as  possible,  consistent  with
           decisions made in other areas  of  the  process  of  immigration
           control.

           11.   If the Secretary of State makes a decision in  a  person's
           favour on the basis of guidance  of  this  sort,  there  can  of
           course be no appeal, and the result will be  that  the  decision
           falls below the radar of consideration by a Tribunal. It is only
           possible for Tribunals to make  decisions  on  matters  such  as
           reasonableness consistently with those that are  being  made  in
           favour of individuals by the Secretary of State if the  Tribunal
           applies similar or identical processes to those employed by  the
           Secretary of State.

           12.   On occasion, perhaps where it has  more  information  than
           the Secretary of State had or might have had, or  perhaps  if  a
           case  is  exceptional,  the  Tribunal  may  find  a  reason  for
           departing from such guidance. But where there is clear  guidance
           which covers a case where an assessment  has  to  be  made,  and
           where the guidance clearly demonstrates what the outcome of  the
           assessment would have been made by the Secretary  of  State,  it
           would, we think, be the normal practice for the Tribunal to take
           such guidance into account and to apply it in assessing the same
           consideration in a case that came before it."

   20. However, the policy stance in force at the time that this appeal  was
       heard by the First Tier Tribunal received no attention here.

   21. I accordingly found that whilst the credibility findings of the First-
       tier Tribunal were not shown to be  erroneous,  there  were  material
       errors of law in the treatment of the reasonableness of  the  British
       citizen child's relocation abroad.

   22. Given that this represented a discrete issue as to which only limited
       further factual findings were required, the appeal was retained for a
       continuation hearing in the Upper Tribunal.

  Findings and reasons - Continuation hearing

   23. At the adjourned hearing, further witness statements  were  provided.
       The Sponsor explained that his marriage to  his  ex-wife,  a  British
       citizen, lasted from 1989 until 10  May  2015,  when  they  finalised
       their divorce. He had five children from that marriage, and continued
       to care for the younger two, Aidan and Ennis, who were  also  British
       citizens; he felt  that  he  could  not  abandon  them.  He  met  the
       Appellant on Facebook in 2016 and first  met  her  in  person  on  30
       January 2017 after she arrived in the UK.  Her  ex-husband  had  been
       murdered on the street because he was a Sunni. He could not  relocate
       to Iraq, having only been to Erbil. He denied having  been  dishonest
       in hiding information regarding the  relationship's  history  to  the
       Secretary of State. His daughter was now breast feeding.

   24. The Appellant stated she had been married to her  former  husband  in
       2005, and had two daughters, [T] (born 22 January 2007) and [J] (born
       10 January 2012). In Iraq she only  had  her  sister,  [E],  who  was
       looking after the two children from a former marriage. Her only other
       family member in Iraq was her father aged 85. Her mother and brothers
       were dead. She had lost her own passport. A lot had changed since her
       husband had last lived in Iraq. Her  daughter  was  still  young  and
       breast-feeding. If she was forced to travel to Iraq she  would  be  a
       single mother, of Sunni religion, an  identity  which  could  not  be
       hidden, and her daughter would be seen to be born out of wedlock, the
       product of adultery.

   25. For the Respondent, Mr Jarvis noted that the policy position  of  the
       Secretary of State had changed.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  had  not
       accepted that there were insurmountable obstacles to  relocation  for
       the UK-based partner; and there was no corroboration of  the  matters
       said  to  point  in  the  opposite  direction.   Parliament   clearly
       countenanced, given the language of section 117B(6), that  a  British
       citizen  child's  relocation   might   be   reasonable   in   certain
       circumstances. He observed that when the Supreme Court  assessed  the
       individual appeals in KO and NS it did not criticise the  Judges  for
       taking public policy considerations into account in  so  far  as  the
       parents'  immigration  history  formed  part  of  the  "real   world"
       appraisal.  Relevant  circumstances  were,  acknowledging  that   the
       child's best interests must be to live in a two-parent family in  the
       UK where both mother and father could participate in her upbringing:

        a) The untruthful asylum claim.

        b) The fact that for the Chikwamba principle to bite, the  evidence
           would have to demonstrate an undeniable claim  for  re-entry  by
           reference to the full criteria of the Rules, whereas here  there
           was no specified evidence provided and not even an assertion  of
           meeting the English language and financial requirements  of  the
           Rules.

        c) Zambrano as interpreted in Dereci and thereafter showed that the
           Zambrano principle was enlivened  only  where  the  parent  with
           primary care responsibilities departure was compelled.

        d) The Appellant had her own elder children residing in  Iraq  whom
           she could rejoin.

        e) The child was very young and of an age where inevitably it would
           not have any connections outside the family unit.

        f) Whether looked at via the "insurmountable obstacles" test  under
           the Rules, or the  "unjustifiably  harsh  consequences"  proviso
           within the GEN3.2 exceptionality  criteria,  the  case  was  not
           viable:  the  background  evidence  did  not  establish  general
           problems in Iraq, the implication of the  First-tier  Tribunal's
           findings being that the Appellant's sister was available to help
           her with childcare, and the Sponsor himself had visited Irbil.

   26. For the Appellant it was submitted that  the  British  citizen  child
       would certainly be required to depart the country if the  appeal  was
       dismissed: she was compelled to follow her mother,  who  was  breast-
       feeding. Powerful reasons were required  to  demand  such  a  child's
       departure, and British citizenship was a particular status  entitling
       the child to access free healthcare.

   27. I mentioned at the hearing that I was inclined to have regard to  the
       FCO advice on Iraq given that it would provide a  general  indication
       as to the possible conditions faced by  British  Citizens  there.  Mr
       Jarvis did not object to this, though noted that a British baby  with
       its Iraqi mother would not present as a typical adult British citizen
       at whom that Guidance was primarily aimed.

   28. As Mr Jarvis noted, the policy guidance for qualifying  children  has
       significantly changed and the relevant passages  found  variously  in
       the guidance to the 10-year and 5-year routes now read:

           Appendix FM 1.0b: family life  (as  a  partner  or  parent)  and
           private life: 10-year routes

           "Reasonable to expect a child to leave the UK?

           This section tells decision makers how to consider whether it is
           reasonable to expect a child to leave the UK.

           The starting point is  that  we  would  not  normally  expect  a
           qualifying child to leave the UK. It is normally  in  a  child's
           best interest for the whole family  to  remain  together,  which
           means if the child is not expected to leave, then the parent  or
           parents or primary carer of the child will also not be  expected
           to leave the UK. In the caselaw of KO and  Others  2018  UKSC53,
           with particular reference to the case of  NS  (Sri  Lanka),  the
           Supreme Court found that "reasonableness" is to be considered in
           the real-world context in which the child finds themselves.  The
           parents' immigration status is a relevant fact to establish that
           context. The determination sets out that if  a  child's  parents
           are both expected  to  leave  the  UK,  the  child  is  normally
           expected to leave with them, unless there is evidence that  that
           it would not  be  reasonable.     There  may  be  some  specific
           circumstances where it would be reasonable to either expect  the
           qualifying child to leave the UK with the parent(s)  or  primary
           carer or for the parent(s) or primary carer to leave the UK  and
           for the child to stay.  In deciding  such  cases,  the  decision
           maker must consider the best interests  of  the  child  and  the
           facts relating to the family as  a  whole.  The  decision  maker
           should also consider any specific issues raised by the family or
           by, or on behalf of the child (or other children in the family).



           It may be reasonable for a qualifying child to leave the UK with
           the parent or primary carer where for example:

           .     the parent or parents, or child,  are  a  citizen  of  the
           country and so able to enjoy the full rights of being a  citizen
           in that country

           .     there is nothing  in  any  country  specific  information,
           including as contained in  relevant  country  information  which
           suggests that relocation would be unreasonable

           .     the parent or  parents  or  child  have  existing  family,
           social, or cultural ties with the country and if there are wider
           family or relationships with friends or community overseas  that
           can provide support:

              o the decision maker must consider the  extent  to  which  the
                child is dependent on or requires support from wider  family
                members in the UK in important areas of his or her life  and
                how a transition to similar support  overseas  would  affect
                them

              o a person who has extended family or a network of friends  in
                the country should be able to rely on them  for  support  to
                help (re)integrate there

              o parent or parents or a child who have lived  in  or  visited
                the country before for periods of  more  than  a  few  weeks
                should be better able to adapt, or  the  parent  or  parents
                would be able to support the child in adapting, to  life  in
                the country

              o the decision maker must consider any  evidence  of  exposure
                to, and the level of understanding of, the cultural norms of
                the country

              o for example,  a  period  of  time  spent  living  amongst  a
                diaspora from the country may give a child an  awareness  of
                the culture of the country

              o the parents or child can speak, read and write in a language
                of that country, or are likely  to  achieve  this  within  a
                reasonable time period

              o  fluency  is  not  required  -  an  ability  to  communicate
                competently with sympathetic  interlocutors  would  normally
                suffice

           .     removal would not give rise to a significant risk  to  the
           child's health

           .     there are no other specific factors raised by or on behalf
           of the child"

           "Factors  relevant  to  the  consideration  of  a  child's  best
           interests will include:

           .     whether their parent  or  parents  is  (are)  expected  to
           remain outside or to leave the UK

           .     the age of the child at the date of application

           .     the child's nationality, with particular importance to  be
           accorded to British citizenship where the child has this

           .     the child's current country of  residence  and  length  of
           residence there

           .     the family circumstances in which the child is living

           .     the physical circumstances in which the child is living

           .     the child's relationships with  their  parent  or  parents
           overseas and in the UK

           .     how long the child has been in education  and  what  stage
           their education has reached

           .     the child's health

           .     the child's connection with the country outside the UK  in
           which their parents are, or one of their parents  is,  currently
           living or where the child is likely to  live  if  their  parents
           leave the UK

           .     the extent to which the decision will interfere  with,  or
           impact on the child's family or private life

           .     how renewable the child's connection is with  the  country
           outside the UK in which their  parents  are,  or  one  of  their
           parents is, currently living . whether  (and,  if  so,  to  what
           extent)  the  child  will  have  linguistic,  medical  or  other
           difficulties in adapting to life in that country

           .     whether there are any factors affecting the child's  well-
           being which can only  be  alleviated  by  the  presence  of  the
           applicant in the UK

           .     what effective and material contribution  the  applicant's
           presence in the UK would make to safeguarding and promoting  the
           child's well-being. Is this significant in nature? For example:

           .     support during or following  a  major  medical  procedure,
           especially if this is likely to lead to a  permanent  change  in
           the child's life

           .     where there is no other family member in the  UK  able  to
           care for the child and the applicant's presence in the  UK  will
           form part of achieving a durable solution for the child that  is
           in their best interests"

   29. Every Child Matters: Change for Children (Guidance issued in November
       2009 under section 55(3) and 55(5) of the 2009  Act)  specifies  that
       safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children shall mean:

           "protecting children from maltreatment;

           preventing impairment of children's health or development (where
           health means 'physical or mental health' and  development  means
           'physical,  intellectual,  emotional,  social   or   behavioural
           development');

           ensuring  that  children  are  growing   up   in   circumstances
           consistent with the provision of safe and effective care; and

           undertaking that role so as to enable  those  children  to  have
           optimum life chances and to enter adulthood successfully."

   30. As stated by Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 �49,  Ex.1
       "establishes as a starting point that leave should be granted  unless
       there are powerful reasons to the contrary"; albeit that �73: "It may
       be reasonable to require the child to  leave  where  there  are  good
       cogent reasons, even if they  are  not  compelling."  Those  comments
       arose in the context of the pre-existing Home Office  policy  regime,
       from  whence  the  "powerful  reasons"   rubric   derives,   but   it
       nevertheless seems to me to accurately summarise  the  considerations
       in play  for  a  British  Citizen  child,  given  the  considerations
       deriving from a child's nationality identified in ZH Tanzania and the
       statutory guidance cited above.

   31. I propose following the balance  sheet  approach  encouraged  by  the
       higher courts in recent times. The  factors  counting  in  favour  of
       departure being reasonable are essentially  those  identified  by  Mr
       Jarvis, which I now summarise and comment upon.

        a) The Appellant entered  the  UK  by  subterfuge  and  pursued  an
           unmeritorious asylum claim: this counts against departure  being
           unreasonable, but only to a limited degree,  in  so  far  as  it
           renders her presence precarious, given the  principle  that  the
           sins of the parents should not be held against  a  child's  best
           interests, and given the child's entitlement to  remain  in  its
           country of nationality  where  its  father  is  also  a  British
           citizen, the KO (Nigeria) "real world" assessment  arises  in  a
           very different context to that where both  parents  are  foreign
           nationals without leave in the UK;

        b) On a return to Iraq, the Appellant would be  able  to  join,  or
           rejoin, family  members,  including  her  sister,  meaning  some
           family unit would be available to help support her in caring for
           the child, and of course the child is at an age where it has  no
           UK ties beyond its parents;

        c) It is unclear whether a watertight  application  could  be  made
           under the Rules to return: though this is  not  a  consideration
           within  the  Rules  and  would  only  be   relevant   were   the
           reasonableness test to be resolved against the Appellant; so too
           Mr Jarvis's reference to the "unjustifiably harsh"  test  is  of
           course only to the benchmark outside the Rules;

        d) This is not a case where the child is compelled to depart the UK
           in the Zambrano sense as it could remain with its  father:  this
           is again not strictly relevant to "reasonableness" as the  Rules
           do not pose the same question as in Zambrano. I admit to finding
           it  difficult  to  accept  the  proposition  that  the  possible
           separation of a breastfeeding child from  it  mother  would  not
           represent circumstances coming  very  close  to  compulsion.  As
           stated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in  Chavez-
           Vilchez [2017] EUECJ C-133/15, the fact that the other parent is
           able and willing to assume sole  responsibility  for  a  child's
           primary care is a relevant factor but not a sufficient ground to
           conclude that the child would not be  compelled  to  follow  the
           parent who present holds that responsibility: the best interests
           of the child must be assessed having regard to all the  specific
           circumstances,  including  their  age,  physical  and  emotional
           development, the extent of his emotional ties both to the  Union
           citizen parent and to the third-country national parent, and the
           risks which separation from the latter  might  entail  for  that
           child's equilibrium. So it seems to me that this  consideration,
           though I have addressed it for convenience in the  debit  column
           (from the  Appellant's  perspective),  actually  points  towards
           departure being unreasonable.

   32. Before looking at the other side of the coin, I  should  mention  the
       FCO's Foreign travel advice for Iraq.

           "Terrorism

           Following Daesh's expansion into the country in 2014, there have
           been numerous and frequent  terrorist  attacks,  and  levels  of
           violence remain high. The UN has reported that  at  least  3,298
           civilians were killed by terrorism and violence during 2017.

           Attacks are more frequent in areas  where  Daesh  had  a  strong
           presence and capability, such as Anbar, Baghdad, Ninewah, Salah-
           Al-Din, Diyala and Tam'mim (Kirkuk) provinces, but  can  and  do
           occur throughout the entire country.

           Safety and security

           ...

           You should avoid political  gatherings  and  large  crowds,  and
           minimise your movement around banks,  restaurants  and  shopping
           malls.  Observe  instructions  given  by  the   local   security
           authorities. ...

           Road travel within  Iraq  remains  highly  dangerous  and  there
           continue to be fatal roadside bombings and attacks  on  military
           and civilian vehicles. False vehicle checkpoints have been  used
           to launch attacks. There  is  also  a  risk  of  carjacking  and
           robbery. ...

           Road  traffic  accidents  are  frequent  and  often  result   in
           fatalities. ...

           Consular assistance

           Consular support  is  severely  limited  in  Iraq.  The  British
           Embassy in Baghdad and the British  Consulate-General  in  Erbil
           operate a limited consular  service  by  appointment  only.  The
           Embassy  and  Consulate-General's  ability  to  visit  locations
           across Iraq is limited and travel to unsecure areas  to  deliver
           consular services may not be possible.

           Health

           Medical facilities are limited. In the event of serious accident
           or illness, an evacuation by air ambulance may be required. Make
           sure you have adequate travel health  insurance  and  accessible
           funds to cover the cost of  any  medical  treatment  abroad  and
           repatriation.

           The temperature in summer months can exceed 50 �C (122�F), which
           can result in dehydration and serious health problems."

   33. Then there are a number of factors  suggesting  that  an  expectation
       that the child depart would be unreasonable:

        a) The child as a British citizen will be required to lose many  of
           the benefits of that citizenship: as  the  FCO  Guidance  shows,
           consular support is "severely limited"  and  medical  facilities
           are limited, and the climate is  very  different  from  that  in
           which the child has so far been raised;

        b) Beyond  those  practical  concerns,  life  in  Iraq  is  clearly
           dangerous due  to  the  problems  with  indiscriminate  acts  of
           terrorism and the general dangers posed by everyday life  there:
           I recognise of course that the child would not be perceived as a
           British citizen if raised amongst an Iraqi family,  but  on  the
           other hand, for the foreseeable future it  would  seem  that  it
           would be unable to proclaim  that  citizenship  without  risking
           some degree of adverse attention;

        c) The father cannot depart the UK on any prolonged  basis  without
           giving up his role in caring for his two youngest children (aged
           two and five), meaning that  carrying  through  the  immigration
           decision would represent a  near  permanent  separation  of  the
           family unit  at  least  for  most  of  the  Appellant's  child's
           childhood, not simply a  temporary  one,  meaning  it  would  be
           raised without a father's regular support notwithstanding  there
           might be other adults around. This would deprive  the  child  of
           the society of part of its extended family.

   34. It seems to me that the balance must be resolved in favour of finding
       the prospect of the child's departure  to  be  unreasonable.  I  have
       discussed the factors above in the context of adumbrating  them,  and
       in general it seems to me that the points in  favour  of  considering
       its  relocation  abroad  to  be  reasonable  are  answered   by   the
       considerations I have already identified above. The real risks to its
       prospects of availing itself of the benefits of  British  citizenship
       in the context of living in a single-parent  family  abroad,  without
       easy access to its father's society, and where the security situation
       is unstable, to my mind outweighs the public interest factors present
       here.

   35. I accordingly allow the appeal.

Decision

There were material  errors  of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal which is set aside.

The appeal is allowed.
