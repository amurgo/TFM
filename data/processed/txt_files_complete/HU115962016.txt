For the Appellant:     Ms K Reid, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. The appellant is from De�an in what is now recognised by the UK  and
       many other  countries  as  the  Republic  of  Kosovo,  although  the
       appellant's nationality is recorded as Serbian. He married his wife,
       Ms Rudima Berisha, in De�an in 1990.  They  have  no  children.  The
       appellant fled the  war  and  claimed  asylum  in  Germany  but  his
       application was refused in 1995 and 1997. He arrived in the UK on 23
       September  1998  and  claimed  asylum  under  a  false  name  (Beqir
       Berisha). His wife was his dependant. Asylum  was  refused  and  his
       appeal dismissed. He made further representations  but  it  came  to
       light he had used a false name and he was removed to  Kosovo  on  20
       January 2005. His wife remained in the UK. He returned to the UK and
       entered illegally on 28 July 2005. He has remained here ever  since.
       His wife was granted settlement and subsequently  naturalised  as  a
       British citizen on 19 October 2011.


    2. On 11 December 2015, the appellant made an application for leave  by
       completing form FLR(FP). His application was  refused  on  15  April
       2016 with a  right  of  appeal.  The  reasons  for  refusal  can  be
       summarised as follows:

        . The application failed under the ten-year partner  route  because
          the test in paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM of the  rules,  that
          the appellant would face insurmountable  obstacles[1]  to  family
          life continuing outside the UK, was not met;
        . The application failed under  the  ten-year  private  life  route
          because the test in paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of  the  rules,  that
          there would be very  significant  obstacles  to  the  appellant's
          integration into Kosovo, was not met; and
        .  The  circumstances  of  the  application  did  not   amount   to
          exceptional circumstances so as  to  warrant  a  grant  of  leave
          outside the rules.

    3. The appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  article  8
       grounds. His appeal was heard by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       McGrade on 14 September 2017 at Taylor House, London. The  appellant
       and his wife gave evidence, as well  as  a  number  of  their  close
       friends.


    4. In a decision promulgated on 6 October 2017, Judge McGrade dismissed
       the appeal. He found as fact the appellant and his wife had put down
       strong roots in the UK and enjoyed close friendships. The  appellant
       had worked as a painter and in property maintenance.  His  wife  was
       employed as a chef. Ms Berisha visited Kosovo[2] in 2017.

    5. The Judge found  the  decision  engaged  article  8  but  it  was  a
       proportionate decision. He accepted that, with the exception of  the
       six months he had spent in Kosovo after being removed there in 2005,
       the appellant had not lived in Kosovo for 24 years. However, he  had
       spent the first 35 years of his life there and he concluded at  [17]
       that there were not very significant obstacles  to  the  appellant's
       integration there. He then considered whether there were  compelling
       circumstances which would warrant  a  grant  of  leave  outside  the
       rules. He noted the appellant had  spent  19  years,  save  for  six
       months in 2005, in the UK and he was married to a  British  citizen.
       They had a genuine and subsisting relationship. The fact they had no
       children favoured the appellant's case because it meant they had  no
       other close family members. Ms Berisha was  extremely  reluctant  to
       return to Kosovo, at least to the  De�an  area.  The  appellant  was
       taking medication for depression but there was no  medical  evidence
       to show he was at a high risk of suicide.

    6.  The  Judge  concluded  at  [30]  that  the  appellant's  "appalling
       immigration history" outweighed these  matters  notwithstanding  the
       fact the decision would  have  "significant  consequences"  for  his
       relationship with his wife and  the  fact  she  was  now  a  British
       citizen.

    7. The appellant sought permission to appeal on two  grounds.  Firstly,
       the Judge had failed to give adequate  reasons  for  his  conclusion
       that paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) was not met. Secondly, the Judge failed
       to provide a properly structured analysis of proportionality and, in
       particular, failed to consider whether it  was  reasonable  for  the
       appellant's wife to relocate to Kosovo, applying VW (Uganda) v  SSHD
       [2009] EWCA Civ 5[3].


    8. Permission to appeal was granted by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
       grant makes  clear  that  the  Judge  considered  the  first  ground
       arguable. The grant also appears to endorse the point  that  it  was
       arguable Judge  McGrade  had  failed  to  consider  whether  it  was
       reasonable to expect Ms Berisha  to  relocate  to  Kosovo  with  the
       appellant.

    9. I heard submissions from the representatives as to whether the First-
       tier Tribunal Judge had made an error of law in his decision.


   10. Ms Reid made two points. Firstly, she argued the Judge had not given
       reasons for finding there were not very significant obstacles to the
       appellant's reintegration in  Kosovo.  In  particular,  he  had  not
       included  in  his   assessment   the   appellant's   mental   health
       difficulties. The appellant had explained that he would have no life
       in Kosovo and his home had been destroyed. Secondly, in finding  the
       public interest outweighed the appellant's interests in enjoying his
       family life in the UK, he had not started by considering whether the
       rules were met.  Specifically, he had not considered  whether  there
       were insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  in  Kosovo.
       He had found the appellant's wife could return to Kosovo but he  had
       not provided reasons for that finding.


   11. Mr Nath pointed out the correct test was no longer as  explained  in
       VW (Uganda), as relied on  in  the  grounds  seeking  permission  to
       appeal, but was now as explained in R (Agyarko) v SSHD  [2017]  UKSC
       11.  He  said  the  Judge  had  dealt  sufficiently  with  paragraph
       276ADE(1)(vi) in relation to the appellant. In  relation  to  family
       life,  there  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family   life
       continuing in Kosovo and the Judge's conclusion was sustainable.  Ms
       Reid reiterated  that  the  decision  did  not  contain  any  proper
       consideration of Appendix FM.

Error of law?
   12. Having carefully read the decision and considered the arguments  put
       forward by the representatives I have concluded that the decision of
       the First-tier Tribunal does not contain any material errors of  law
       such that it must be set aside. The appeal is  therefore  dismissed.
       My reasons are as follows.


   13. Dealing firstly with paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi),  the  meaning  of  the
       similar provisions in  relation  to  deportation  appeals  found  in
       section 117C(4) of the 2002 Act and paragraph 339A of the rules were
       considered in SSHD v AK (Sierra Leone) [2016] EWCA Civ 813. Sales LJ
       said at paragraph [14] that the "idea of "integration" calls  for  a
       broad evaluative judgment to be made as to  whether  the  individual
       will be enough of an insider in terms of understanding how  life  in
       the society in that other country is carried on and  a  capacity  to
       participate in it, so as to have  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  be
       accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-day basis in  that
       society and to build up within a reasonable time a variety of  human
       relationships to give  substance  to  the  individual's  private  or
       family life."  In  Treebhawon  and  Others  (NIAA  2002  Part  5A  -
       compelling circumstances test) [2017] UKUT 00013 (IAC), McCloskey J,
       in re-making the decision, said  the  "very  significant  obstacles"
       test  was  clearly  an  elevated  threshold.  Mere  hardship,   mere
       difficulty,  and  mere  upheaval  or   inconvenience,   even   where
       multiplied, will generally be insufficient (see [37]).


   14. At [16] the Judge noted  that  the  appellant  relied  on  paragraph
       276ADE(1)(vi). He then decided the issue as follows:

         "I have accepted the Appellant was born in De�an  and  lived  there
         for the first 35 years of his life. He married his wife  there.  He
         returned there in January 2005 and remained there for a  period  of
         six months. During that six-month period, he lived with friends and
         relatives. I accept that, with  the  exception  of  that  six-month
         period, he has not lived in Kosovo for more than 24 years. However,
         I am unable to  conclude  that  there  would  be  very  significant
         obstacles to the Appellant's integration into the country to  which
         he would have to go if required to leave the United Kingdom."

   15. The reasoning is concise but adequate. The test imposes an  elevated
       threshold and it was sufficient for the Judge to say  that,  despite
       not having lived there for 24 years,  the  fact  the  appellant  had
       resided there for six months before returning (illegally) to the  UK
       showed he would be able to reintegrate. He noted the  appellant  had
       been able  to  stay  with  relatives  and  friends  in  Kosovo.  The
       appellant had lived most of his life in Kosovo. The appellant  would
       not therefore be without support and he would be able to participate
       meaningfully in day-to-day life. He did not  lack  familiarity  with
       the language, culture and way of life in Kosovo. At  [24]  he  noted
       the appellant was familiar with Kosovo and that the medical evidence
       did not suggest a severe mental health condition. I see no error  of
       law of the kind described by Ms Reid.


   16. Turning to the other ground pursued by Ms Reid, the correct approach
       to article 8 in cases of precarious family life has been the subject
       of definitive guidance in the judgment of Lord Reed in Agyarko.  His
       Lordship explained that the test  of  insurmountable  obstacles,  as
       used in paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM of the rules and later defined
       in paragraph EX.2, was taken from the jurisprudence of the ECtHR:
         "42. In Jeunesse, the Grand Chamber identified,  consistently  with
         earlier judgments of the court, a number of  factors  to  be  taken
         into account in assessing the proportionality under  article  8  of
         the removal of non - settled migrants from a contracting  state  in
         which they have family  members.  Relevant  factors  were  said  to
         include the extent  to  which  family  life  would  effectively  be
         ruptured, the extent of the ties in the contracting state,  whether
         there were "insurmountable obstacles" in  the  way  of  the  family
         living in the country of origin of the non  -  national  concerned,
         and whether there were factors of immigration control (for example,
         a history of breaches of  immigration  law)  or  considerations  of
         public order weighing in favour of exclusion (para 107).
         43.  It  appears  that  the  European  court  intends   the   words
         "insurmountable obstacles" to be  understood  in  a  practical  and
         realistic sense, rather than as referring solely to obstacles which
         make it literally impossible for the family to live together in the
         country of origin of the non - national concerned. In  some  cases,
         the court has used other expressions which make that  clearer:  for
         example, referring to "un obstacle majeur" (Sen v  The  Netherlands
         (2003) 36 EHRR 7, para 40), or to "major  impediments"  (Tuquabo  -
         Tekle v The Netherlands [2006] 1 FLR 798 , para  48),  or  to  "the
         test of ' insurmountable obstacles' or 'major impediments'" ( IAA v
         United Kingdom (2016) 62 EHRR SE 19, paras 40 and  44),  or  asking
         itself whether the family could "realistically" be expected to move
         (Sezen  v  The  Netherlands  (2006)   43   EHRR   30,   para   47).
         "Insurmountable obstacles" is, however, the expression employed  by
         the Grand Chamber; and the court's application of it indicates that
         it is a stringent test. In Jeunesse, for example, there  were  said
         to be no insurmountable obstacles to the relocation of  the  family
         to Suriname, although the children,  the  eldest  of  whom  was  at
         secondary school, were Dutch nationals  who  had  lived  there  all
         their lives, had never visited Suriname,  and  would  experience  a
         degree of hardship if forced to move, and the  applicant's  partner
         was in full - time employment in the Netherlands: see paras 117 and
         119."
   17. Clearly, the reasonableness test advocated in  the  grounds  seeking
       permission to appeal is no longer apposite. I agree with Mr Nath  on
       this point and Ms Reid  did  not  seek  to  persuade  me  otherwise.
       Rather, she argued the  Judge  had  erred  by  not  identifying  the
       insurmountable obstacles which existed on the facts of the case.


   18. Returning to the Judge's decision, it is unlikely there could  be  a
       material error simply because the Judge failed to frame his decision
       on the question  of  whether  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles
       within the rules or outside  the  rules  because,  as  explained  in
       Agyarko, the rules are in line with Strasbourg jurisprudence on  the
       point.


   19. The argument that the appellant's wife could not  accompany  him  to
       Kosovo does not show the threshold of insurmountable  obstacles  has
       been reached. The Judge  was  entitled  to  find  that,  whilst  the
       appellant's wife would not wish to resettle in De�an, where she  had
       bad experiences during the  war,  she  is  not  a  refugee  and  she
       voluntarily visited Kosovo last year in order to attend a wedding.


   20. The Judge gave weight to the  public  interest  and  considered  the
       factors set out in section 117B  of  the  2002  Act.  As  Lord  Reed
       explained, it is perfectly legitimate to take account of breaches of
       immigration law weighing in favour of exclusion. I see no  error  in
       this aspect of the Judge's decision either.
NOTICE OF DECISION

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not make a material error of
    law and his decision dismissing the appeal is upheld.

     No anonymity direction is made.

[1] The RFRL erroneously refers to "very significant obstacles".
[2] It was agreed the Judge's reference to Albania was a slip of the pen.
[3] At paragraph 24, Sedley LJ stated as follows: "EB (Kosovo) now confirms
that the material question in gauging the proportionality of  a  removal  or
deportation which will or may break up a family  unless  the  family  itself
decamps is not whether there is an insuperable obstacle  to  this  happening
but whether it is  reasonable  to  expect  the  family  to  leave  with  the
appellant."
