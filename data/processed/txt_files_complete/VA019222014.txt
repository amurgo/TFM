For the Appellant:     Mr Tufan
For the Respondent:    Mr Ward


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Mr Amin is a citizen of Sudan born  in  1986.   He  appeals  against  a
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer, Nairobi made on 5  March  2014
    to refuse his application for entry clearance to visit his parents  for
    two months.  His parents were granted visit visas in March 2011.   They
    were granted leave to remain as refugees in March 2013.

 2. The reason for the proposed visit was that Mr Amin's father was due  to
    undergo eye surgery.

 3. The ECO refused the application for the following  reasons.   He  noted
    that in support of his application Mr Amin had submitted a  letter  (11
    April 2013) from his father's  GP  which  states  that  his  father  is
    anxious and depressed because he has concerns about his three  children
    who are living in Sudan and "one of his sons has been persecuted  as  a
    Christian and Mr Khalil fears for his son's life".

 4. Second, that although Mr Amin claimed to  be  employed  as  a  purchase
    manager for a factory and had submitted a letter from his employer,  he
    had not submitted any payslips or personal bank statements to show that
    his circumstances are as stated.

 5. Third, Mr Amin had stated that his father would pay for his travel  and
    stay in the UK.  However, the only deposits in his account were  public
    funds insufficient to sponsor the trip.  Mr Amin had not shown  he  had
    the ability to finance his trip.

 6. For these reasons the ECO  refused  the  application  under  paragraphs
    41(i), (ii), (vi) and (vii) of the Immigration Rules.

 7. Mr Amin appealed.  His appeal rights were limited to human rights.

 8. Following a hearing at Taylor House on 20 February 2015  Judge  of  the
    First-tier  Ievins allowed the appeal under Article 8.

 9. His findings are at paragraph 22 ff  of  his  decision.   Having  heard
    evidence from Mr Amin's  parents  he  found  them  both  credible.   He
    accepted  that  what  the  father  said  to   the   GP   had   been   a
    "misunderstanding" and that what he had meant was that he, not his son,
    had been persecuted as a Christian in Sudan.

10. He found, however,  that  the  "Sponsor  is  genuinely  distressed  and
    anxious for his children.  He is not in good health, he is living in  a
    foreign country  (which  has  looked  after  him  well)  and  perfectly
    understandably very much wants to see his youngest child.   Neither  he
    nor his wife are in any physical state to travel to the Sudan  and  the
    Sponsor himself has refugee status."  [22]

11. The judge concluded that a genuine visit was intended and that Mr  Amin
    intended to leave.  Thus paragraph 41(i) and (ii) were satisfied.

12. The judge went on to find for reasons he gave in [24] and [25] that the
    requirements of paragraph 41(vi) and (vii) were met.

13. The fact that he satisfied the paragraph was "relevant  to  Article  8"
    [26] to which he turned next.

14. His analysis began at [29] where  he  stated  "...  I  must  first  ask
    whether the proposed ... refusal of an application would amount  to  an
    interference by a public authority with the exercise of the applicant's
    right to respect for his private and/or family life  ...  human  beings
    are social animals and require human relationships to  flourish  ...  .
    The Appellant can speak to his parents across  the  continents  on  the
    telephone but that is no substitute for face to  face  contact  between
    parents and children.  I am satisfied that to refuse  this  application
    does amount to an interference with the  exercise  of  the  Applicant's
    right to respect for his private and family life (and, by virtue of the
    case of Beoku-Betts, it  also  amounts  to  an  interference  with  the
    Sponsor's right to  respect  for  family  life  with  his  son).   Such
    interference would in  my  judgment  have  consequences  of  sufficient
    gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8."

15. The judge went on to consider that there would be no cost to the public
    purse if he stayed with his parents for a month or two.  Also  that  he
    gave "weight to the factors set out in Section 117B".  [30]

16. He concluded that having met the requirements of the Rules there was no
    public interest in refusing a visa [31], and allowed the  appeal  under
    Article 8.

17. The ECO sought permission to appeal which was granted by a judge  on  6
    May 2015.

18. At the error of law hearing before me Mr Tufan's  point  was  that  the
    judge failed to identify the basis for his, apparent, finding  at  [29]
    that there was family life between Mr Amin who is an adult son, and his
    parents.  Article 8 was simply not engaged. There was no  family  life.
    As such the Razgar assessment was flawed.  His invited me to remake the
    decision dismissing it.

19. Mr Ward accepted that the judge had failed adequately to  give  reasons
    for his finding that there was family life.

20. I agreed. Such was a material error. I set aside  the  decision  to  be
    remade.  It was not suggested that  the  factual  findings  should  not
    stand.

21. In submissions Mr Tufan had nothing to add to his  earlier  point.   Mr
    Ward submitted that the legal position was not as confined as Mr  Tufan
    suggested.  It all depended on the facts.   In  this  case  it  was  an
    intended visit by an adult son to his gravely ill father who could  not
    travel to Sudan or to a third country.  It was not a holiday on a whim.
     It would likely be the last time  his  father  sees  him.   The  facts
    amounted to a relationship beyond normal emotional ties.

22. In Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31 the Court of Appeal said in order
    to establish family life, it is necessary to show that there is a  real
    committed or effective  support  or  relationship  between  the  family
    members and the normal emotional ties between a parent and an adult son
    would not without more, be enough.

23. In Etti-Adegbola v SSHD [2009]  EWCA  Civ  1319  the  Court  of  Appeal
    concentrated on the last part of  that  test  and  confirmed  that  the
    Tribunal had  applied  the  right  test  in  finding  that  a  family's
    behaviour was "no way exceptional or beyond the norm".

24. Both parties referred me to Mostafa  (Article  8  in  entry  clearance)
    [2015] UKUT 112 (IAC) at [24].  Mr Ward noted: "It is the very  essence
    of Article 8 that it lays down  fundamental  values  that  have  to  be
    considered in all relevant cases.   It  would  therefore  be  extremely
    foolish to attempt to be prescriptive given the intensely  factual  and
    contextual sensitivity of every case".

25. Mr Tufan directed me to later  in  the  paragraph:  "We  are,  however,
    prepared to say that it will only be in very unusual circumstances that
    a person other than a close relative will be  able  to  show  that  the
    refusal of entry clearance comes within the scope of Article 8(1).   In
    practical terms this is  likely  to  be  limited  to  cases  where  the
    relationship is that of husband and wife or other close  life  partners
    or a parent and a minor child ...".

26. It is relevant to note that in Mostafa it was accepted that  there  was
    family life, namely, husband and wife.

27. In Adjei (visit visas - Article 8 [2015] UKUT 0261 (IAC)  it  was  held
    that the first question to be addressed in an appeal against refusal to
    grant entry  clearance  as  a  visitor  where  only  human  rights  are
    available is whether Article 8 is engaged at all.  If  it  is  not  the
    Tribunal has no jurisdiction  to  embark  upon  an  assessment  of  the
    decision of the ECO under the Rules and should not do so.

28. In the circumstances of this case I thus need first to consider whether
    there is family life. It all depends on the facts. Mr Amin is  a  young
    man of 28 years of age.   It  seems  he  is  in  good  health.   He  is
    independent. He has a fiancï¿½e and is in employment.  He  also  has  his
    siblings close by.  There  is  no  suggestion  of  dependency  of   his
    parents on Mr Amin.  He has long established his own life.

29. He has not seen his parents since they came to the UK in March 2012  as
    visitors.  It seems they subsequently claimed and were granted  refugee
    status.  The indication from the evidence is that they have settled and
    are coping well.  Although reliant on benefits they  have  saved  money
    and they are financially independent of their children.

30. The indication from several medical letters is that the  father  has  a
    number of serious medical  conditions.   Also,  that  he  suffers  from
    depression and  anxiety.   He  is  receiving  treatment  for  both  his
    physical and mental health problems.

31. I see no reason to doubt that the father, particularly as he is unwell,
    would like to see his own son again face to face and that it would  not
    be possible for him to travel to Sudan or a third country to do so.

32. I see no reason to doubt that Mr  Amin  is  concerned  for  his  father
    particularly in light of his poor health.

33. In Kugathas at [19] it states "... neither blood ties nor  the  concern
    and affection that ordinarily  go  with  them  are,  by  themselves  or
    together in my judgement enough to constitute family life.  Most of  us
    have close relatives of whom we are extremely fond and whom  we  visit,
    or who visit us from time to time; but none of us would  say  on  those
    grounds alone that we share a  family  life  with  them  in  any  sense
    capable of coming within the meaning and purpose of Article 8".

34. On the facts of this case I do not see that  there  exist  ties  strong
    enough to constitute family life within the meaning of the Article.

35. Mr Amin's appeal fails at the first hurdle.
