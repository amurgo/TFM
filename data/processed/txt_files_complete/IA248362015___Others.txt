For the Appellants:    Miss K Anifowoshe of Counsel, Raj Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are  citizens  of  Vietnam  and  the  first  and  second
    applicants are the parents of the third and  fourth  applicants.   They
    were born, respectively on 17th April 1982, 13th July 1979,  [  ]  2009
    and [ ] 2012.

Immigration History

2.   On 22nd June 2015, the respondent refused the appellants'  applications
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on human rights grounds.  The
    appellants appealed and their appeals were heard  at  Hatton  Cross  on
    25th October 2016, by First-tier Tribunal Judge Mailer.

3.   The first appellant arrived in the United Kingdom  on  5th  July  2008,
    with entry clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Student valid from 30th June
    2008, until 30th August 2009.  Leave  was  subsequently  extended  from
    22nd September 2009 until 1st April 2011.   She  met  her  partner  the
    second named appellant in the United Kingdom in July 2009 and the third
    appellant was born in the United Kingdom on 21st March 2009.

4.   The first named appellant made  application  for  leave  to  remain  on
    human rights grounds with the third appellant listed  as  a  dependant.
    The application was dated  4th  March  2011  and  was  refused  by  the
    respondent on 9th May 2011.  On 11th August  2011  their  appeals  were
    allowed on human rights grounds.  As a result, on 17th April 2012,  the
    first and third appellants were granted discretionary leave  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom until 1st February 2013.

5.   On 23rd November 2014 the fourth  appellant  was  born  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The first appellant made application on  6th  February  2013,
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on human rights grounds  with
    her two sons as dependants.  This was refused by the respondent  and  a
    Section 47 notice was served on 18th June  2013.   Her  appeal  against
    that decision was only allowed on Section 47 grounds.  On 31st  October
    2013, her appeal rights were exhausted.

6.   On 1st September 2014, the appellants  made  a  joint  application  for
    leave to remain on human rights grounds and that was refused without  a
    right of appeal on 28th October 2014.  Following a pre-action  protocol
    letter the respondent undertook to review the decision and subsequently
    issued a further refusal letter dated 25th June  2015,  which  was  the
    subject of the appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

7.   The second named  appellant  entered  the  United  Kingdom  with  entry
    clearance as a work permit holder on 5th  June  2004.   On  14th  April
    2011, he was served with IS151A Part 2 as an illegal entrant  following
    his admission that he had paid an agent to obtain a passport and  false
    visa  to  gain  entry  to  the  United  Kingdom.   He   was   detained,
    subsequently released and  made  an  asylum  application.   His  appeal
    against refusal was dismissed on 11th June 2013.  His  application  for
    leave to appeal was refused and he became appeal  rights  exhausted  on
    16th July,2013.


Hearing before the First Tier Tribunal Judge

8.   The judge heard evidence from the first named appellant and  considered
    a letter from the first named appellant's 'adoptive' parents in France.
    Whether, in fact the first  named  appellant  was  legally  adopted  in
    France is not known, but from an early age she was  taken  under  their
    wing and visited regularly by them and also supported financially  from
    time to time by them.

9.   The judge noted that the third named appellant was now 7 years  of  age
    and a qualifying  child  in  Section  117D  of  the  2002  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act.  The judge considered the Court of Appeal's
    decision in MA (Uganda) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2016] EWCA Civ 450 and in EV Philippines v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874.  He considered the best  interests
    of the children and at paragraph 117 said this

          "in the circumstances, I do not find that  there  are  strong  or
         powerful reasons why it would not be  reasonable  or  proportionate
         for [AH] to be removed together with his parents if  their  removal
         is proportionate."

     That sentence was challenged by the appellants and, as  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Smith said in granting leave to appeal,

         "it may be that his use of  multiple  negatives  in  the  sentence
         which renders its meaning opaque, however, on my reading of it that
         is requiring that there be strong or powerful reasons why the child
         should not be removed rather than assuming a default position  that
         the child should not be removed and requiring there to be strong or
         powerful reasons why he should be."

Hearing before me.

10.  Before me today Mr Duffy accepted that there was an  error  of  law  in
    the judge's decision.  Counsel on behalf  of  the  appellants  accepted
    that there were no other errors in the  judge's  decision.   Mr  Duffy,
    quite correctly in my view, accepted that the appeal should be  allowed
    outright and I am happy to do that.

11.  The appellant's appeals are allowed.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

justified) for the following reason.  The appeal is allowed.
