                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I  will  refer  to
    the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of China born  on  17th  December  1983.  He
    first came to the UK on 24th February 2002 with leave as a student, and
    extended his leave  in  this  capacity  until  26th  October  2013.  He
    applied, in time, on 2nd October 2013 for indefinite  leave  to  remain
    based on his long residence with applications also being made  for  his
    partner and daughter who are Japanese nationals.  His  application  was
    refused on 12th March 2014. He appealed on 26th March 2014.  His appeal
    was allowed in a determination of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Majid promulgated on 13th November 2014.

 3. On 2nd January 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Pooler found  that
    there was an arguable error of law and  granted  permission  to  appeal
    because it was arguable that Judge Majid had not given adequate reasons
    for his conclusions; had  misdirected  himself  in  giving  "paramount"
    weight to the best interests of the child and had not made it clear  on
    what basis he allowed the appeal.

 4. The matter came before me to determine whether the First-tier  Tribunal
    had erred in law.

Submissions

 5. The parties were agreed that the determination  of  Judge  Majid  erred
    fatally in law and had to be set aside. Ms  Fisher  advocated,  and  Mr
    Shilliday did not object to my finding, that the decision  be  remitted
    to the Secretary of State as it was not in accordance with the  law  on
    the basis that the Secretary of State had  exercised  discretion  under
    his policy  with  regard  to  absences  under  paragraph  276B  of  the
    Immigration Rules on a wrong factual basis.

 6. I informed the parties that I found that Judge Majid had erred  in  law
    and that I would set aside his decision, and would re-make  it  with  a
    finding that the decision was not in accordance with the  law  for  the
    reasons set out below.

Conclusions

 7. The determination  of  Judge  Majid  does  not  give  reasons  why  the
    appellant succeeds in his appeal so it is unclear whether the appeal is
    allowed under a provision of the Immigration Rules or under  Article  8
    ECHR outside of the Immigration Rules. Judge  Majid  includes  a  large
    amount of irrelevant material in his determination concerning Article 3
    ECHR and commenting on the new Article 8 Immigration  Rules,  and  does
    not make relevant factual findings tied to any legal framework.  Whilst
    reliance is based on the best interests of the appellant's child  these
    are not specified in any way, and Judge Majid errs  in  law  in  saying
    that they should be given "paramount weight" at  paragraph  17  of  his
    determination. I therefore find that the determination  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal should be set aside in its entirety.

 8.  The  refusal  letter  of  8th  March  2014  examines  the  appellant's
    application to remain under paragraph 276B of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    For the appellant to have ten years of continuous lawful residence  for
    paragraph 276B (i)(a) of the Immigration Rules he has to show that  his
    residence is "continuous residence" as defined in paragraph 276A of the
    Immigration Rules. At 276A(a)(v) this is defined as  meaning  that  the
    appellant must not have spent more than 18  months  (540  days)  absent
    during the period in question. It is accepted by the appellant that  he
    had exceeded this period of absence from the UK during  his  period  of
    residence. With  his  original  application  he  submitted  a  schedule
    showing he had been absent from the UK for a total of 675 days  in  his
    entire period of residence, from 24th February  2002  to  present  -  a
    period of 13 years lawful residence. If the ten year period  was  taken
    backwards from today's date it would be a lesser  number  of  582  days
    absent during this period.

 9. In the refusal letter the respondent then rightly went on  to  consider
    the Modernised Guidance on Long Residence and Private Life in  relation
    to the exercise of discretion as to whether to treat  continuous  leave
    as  broken  by  a  period  of  absence  in  excess  of  540  days.   In
    consideration of the exercise of this discretion the respondent however
    states that the appellant had had a single absence of  181  days  which
    exceeded six months and therefore counted  against  him.  This  is  not
    correct: the appellant's longest absence was for a period  of  83  days
    (his engagement holiday  to  China  between  10th  June  2008  and  2nd
    September 2008). The appellant is a qualified architect working  for  a
    high profile architectural organisation, and argues that the respondent
    should exercise discretion in his favour as 119 days  have  been  spent
    abroad for his work as an architect (and  35  days  were  on  mandatory
    study trips) and also because 49 days were  spent  abroad  due  to  the
    death  of  his  grandmother.  No  apparently  consideration  of   these
    arguments has been made by the respondent although they are  made  with
    supporting evidence.

10. In considering the application of the appellant under paragraph  276ADE
    of the Immigration Rules I also note that the  respondent  states  that
    the appellant is 50 years old and has been in the UK since March  2001.
    This is also clearly factually incorrect. The appellant entered the  UK
    on 24th February 2002 and is 31 years old. This is relevant as it means
    that that the appellant has spent more than a third of his life in  the
    UK rather than just over one fifth.

11. I find that the respondent's decision is not in accordance with the law
    for want of consideration of the correct facts  as  set  out  above  in
    exercising discretion under her policy to disregard absences in  excess
    of 540 days  from  the  UK  when  assessing  continuous  residence  for
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules. A new lawful  decision  should
    be issued on this point. If  the  refusal  is  maintained  following  a
    proper and reasoned consideration of this exercise of  discretion  then
    the refusal under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules should also
    be reviewed in the light of the appellant's correct age and  proportion
    of his life spent in the UK.

Decision

      1. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law.

      2. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

      3. The appeal is remade allowing it to the extent that the  matter  is
         remitted to the Secretary of State for  a  fresh  decision  on  the
         basis that the current refusal is not in accordance with the law.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a partial  fee
award of ï¿½70 as the appellant  was  entitled  to  a  decision  that  was  in
accordance with the law based on the correct facts he had put forward.
