                                MOHAMMAD [S]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This determination is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's decision dated  18  February  2018,  refusing  the
         appellant's claim.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge P A  Grant-Hutchison,  promulgated  on  9
         June 2018.

     iv) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal dated 26 June 2018.

      v) The grant of permission by FtT Judge Landes, dated 6 July 2018.

 2. The judge finds at [16] that the evidence of Mr Taylor, a senior member
    of the Tron Church, Glasgow, must be given "considerable  weight",  and
    says at [17] that his decision is  reached  on  "the  totality  of  the
    evidence".  However, Mr Govan conceded that  the  grounds  demonstrated
    that the decision, as a whole, disclosed "compartmentalisation" of  the
    evidence, and an incorrect approach  to  the  evidence  of  Mr  Taylor,
    errors illuminated by TF and MA v SSHD [2018] CSIH 58.

 3. The following outcome was agreed.

 4. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 5. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 6. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Grant-Hutchison.

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
