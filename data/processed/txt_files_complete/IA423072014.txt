Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Ali (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz (HOPO)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge Mather, promulgated  on
    18th February 2015,  following  a  hearing  at  Stoke-on-Trent  on  2nd
    February 2015.  In the determination, the judge allowed the  appeal  of
    the Appellant, whereupon the Respondent Secretary of State subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of  India,  who  was  born  on  19th
    October 1989.  He appealed against a decision of the Respondent made on
    4th October 2014, to refuse his application made on 4th August 2014 for
    a variation of leave on the basis of paragraph 245DD.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he is now 26 years of age and has been in
    the UK since 2010 and has studied for a Masters Degree in International
    Business and Finance at De Montfort University from 14th  October  2010
    until 20th March 2012.  He was granted leave as  a  PSW  Migrant  valid
    until 7th August 2014.  His current application  is  dated  4th  August
    2014 and he  had  initially  applied  with  Mr  Rizwan  Tariq  who  had
    withdrawn his appeal and Mr Tariq's wife had  applied  to  emigrate  to
    Australia.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge summarised his findings at paragraph 6 of the  determination.
    He gave due attention to paragraphs  41-SD(e)(iv)  and  held  that  the
    evidence produced did cover the  continuous  period  commencing  before
    11th July 2014 and was in the form requested under the Rules.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application  state  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  by
    allowing the appeal when the specified evidence required  by  paragraph
    41-SD(e) was not met.  The judge at paragraph  6(vii)  and  (viii)  had
    accepted the Appellant has not provided the specified evidence but went
    on to allow the appeal on the basis that  the  Appellant  had  met  the
    requirement of the Immigration Rules.  The decision, it  was  said  was
    very short and arguable grounds existed.

Submissions

 6. At the hearing before me on 8th April 2016, both parties submitted that
    they did not have sight of the Grounds of Appeal, whereupon I gave them
    a copy of my  Grounds  of  Appeal  before  the  hearing  commenced  any
    further.

 7. Mr Ali, handed up his skeleton argument, appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant, and he submitted that  the  judge's  decision  was  entirely
    beyond reproach because he had  dealt  with  every  issue  step-by-step
    demonstrating  that  the  Appellant  had  proved,  on  a   balance   of
    probabilities, that the  requirements  of  the  Rules  were  met.   For
    example, the HMRC document is dated 2013 and not 2014, but it is  clear
    that the business is registered for full corporation tax, otherwise the
    Appellant would not be given the  documentation  from  the  authorities
    that he was.  This documentation appears at E1 and it is clear that the
    Appellant is registered for corporation tax.  There is nothing  in  the
    Rules requiring anything more.  Second, the Appellant is criticised for
    providing a bank statement but no supporting  letter  from  his  branch
    manager of the bank.  However, the Rules only require either  a  letter
    from the UK branch of  the  bank  or  a  bank  statement  itself.   The
    Appellant had provided the bank statement at F2.   The  Rules  required
    nothing more.  Third,  the  Appellant  had  ï¿½944  90  days  before  the
    application, and the objection was taken that his statement  needed  to
    be stamped, but there is no requirement in the Rules that the statement
    needs to be stamped.

 8. Finally, it is said that the Appellant had nothing to show before  11th
    July, but there plainly was.  The advertising material shows  at  pages
    12 to 13 of the Appellant's bundle that the website  for  the  business
    was registered on 16th June 2014.

 9. In his reply, Mr Diwnycz relied upon the Grounds of Appeal.

No Error of Law

10. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error  of  law  (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    [2007]) such that I should set aside the decision.  My reasons  are  as
    follows.

11. First, in accordance with Mr Ali's submissions before me, the judge was
    clear that, "the Appellant correctly points  out  that  the  Respondent
    failed to understanding that the printing date did not  mean  that  the
    website was registered on the same date" and that  "the  website  pages
    were printed for the purpose of the application and, therefore, 24 July
    2014 is on the pages" (see paragraph 6(iv)).

12. Second, the judge went on  to  say  that  she  would  accept  that  the
    Appellant had "posted brochures  and  business  cards  by  first  class
    guaranteed delivery to the Respondent on 4th September 2014  which  was
    before the date of refusal on 4th October 2014" (see paragraph 6(v)).

13. Third, the judge also held that "the Appellant had sent a  letter  from
    HMRC dated 2013" and that she was satisfied that the Respondent "should
    have either made the verification check on their system, or used  their
    discretion to request further information." (see paragraph 6(vi)).

14. Fourth, with respect to the registration for corporation tax, the judge
    went on to say that, "the requirement is just to provide  a  letter  to
    confirm the business as business premises in the UK and is  subject  to
    UK tax, which was provided" (see paragraph 6(vii).

15. Fifth, as far as the bank statements were concerned, the judge went  on
    to say that, "I  accept  the  Rule  requires  either  a  business  bank
    statement or a bank letter with confirmation of the applicant  being  a
    signatory.  The Appellant provided the  business  bank  statement  and,
    therefore, he did not have to  provide  the  alternative  letter"  (see
    paragraph 6(viii)).

16. Finally, there is the issue of maintenance and the judge said that  the
    Respondent "has ignored the fact that the statement was printed on  the
    bank letterhead, and therefore was not stamped" (see paragraph 6(ix)).

17. Accordingly, with respect to each  of  the  issues  taken  against  the
    Appellant,  the   judge   did   provide   entirely   satisfactory   and
    comprehensive reasoning,  with  specific  reference  to  the  objective
    evidence  before  her,  before  concluding  as  she  did.    Mr   Ali's
    submissions before me are accordingly entirely appropriate.
