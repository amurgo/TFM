               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    No appearance
For the Respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Before the Upper Tribunal  the  Secretary  of  State  now  becomes  the
    appellant.  However, for the avoidance of confusion, I  shall  continue
    to refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. On 3rd March 2015 Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Vaudin  d'Imï¿½court
    gave permission to the respondent to appeal  against  the  decision  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal T R P Hollingworth in which he allowed
    the appeal on Article 8 grounds outside the Immigration  Rules  against
    the decision of the respondent to refuse to grant indefinite  leave  to
    remain for the first appellant and further  leave  to  remain  for  the
    second appellant.

 3. At the commencement of the hearing in the Upper Tribunal before  me  Ms
    Johnstone stated  that  the  respondent  had  received  information  to
    indicate that both appellants had left the United Kingdom on 29th March
    2015 bound for Osaka via Helsinki. She produced a Home Office print-out
    to confirm.  In these circumstances she asked me to regard the  appeals
    as  abandoned  although  she  also  suggested  that  the  Home   Office
    application should be decided on its merits.

 4. Having reserved my decision I now set out  my  reasons  for  concluding
    that it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to proceed  further  with  this
    appeal.

 5. Section 92(8) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  as
    substituted by Section 17 of the Immigration Act 2014 from 20th October
    2014, reads as follows:

         '(8) Where an appellant brings an appeal  from  within  the  United
             Kingdom but leaves the United Kingdom  before  the  appeal  is
             finally determined, the appeal is to be treated  as  abandoned
             unless  the  claim  to  which  the  appeal  relates  has  been
             certified under Section 94(1) or (7) or Section 94B.'

 6. This appeal has not  been  finally  determined  because  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal has been granted  and  it  is  awaiting  a
    determination. It is not a certified claim. The decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal is  not,  therefore,  the  final  determination  of  this
    matter.  Applying  the  provisions  of  Section  92(8)  the  appeal  is
    therefore abandoned before it is finally determined.  On that basis  it
    is unnecessary for the Upper Tribunal to proceed to determine the error
    of law issue because the whole appeal falls away.

Decision

The appeal by the appellants which has not been finally determined has  been
abandoned and the Tribunal will take no further action.

Anonymity

Anonymity was not requested before the Upper Tribunal nor do I  consider  it
appropriate in this case.
