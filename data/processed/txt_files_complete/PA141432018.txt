Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms F Shaw, Counsel instructed by London Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       1. On 6 January 2020 I set aside part of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
          decision dismissing the appeal of this young man from  Turkey.  In
          this determination I remake that part of the decision.


       2. The appellant is a Turkish national and an Alevi Kurd  born  on  6
          April 1994. He entered the UK as a visitor  in  October  2017  and
          claimed asylum on 3 April 2018. His claim is that his brother  had
          been expelled from a school of Specialised Gendarmerie in 2002,  a
          month prior to his graduation, without being given any reasons and
          had appealed the decision to the European Court of Human Rights on
          the basis that he had been unjustly denied access to the  evidence
          of the investigation undertaken of him and his family which led to
          the exclusion order. The Ministry of the Interior also  sought  to
          be reimbursed for tuition and pension fees that had been paid out,
          to be reclaimed through the father's salary. The appellant  was  7
          years  old  at  that  time.  He  claims  that  due  to  the  court
          proceedings, the family became known to the  Turkish  authorities.
          His brother was subsequently called up  for  military  service  in
          February 2005 and  died  on  8  September  2005  whilst  still  in
          service. The authorities attempted to pass it off as suicide,  but
          the family had  disputed  this.  Despite  the  opposition  of  the
          Turkish government, the family were given permission by  the  ECHR
          to continue the proceedings following the death and eventually, on
          21 April 2009, the Strasbourg court found that there  had  been  a
          violation of article 6 of the Convention in that  the  appellant's
          brother had not had a fair trial in respect of  his  challenge  to
          the decision to expel him from military school because he had  not
          been given access to documents classed as confidential before  the
          military court. He, or rather his family, was awarded  2000  euros
          in costs and 6,500 euros non-pecuniary damage.  This  is  said  to
          have caused further problems with the authorities.


       3. The appellant also claimed that  after  his  brother's  death,  he
          became involved with EMEP and had been arrested as  a  result.  He
          further claimed that he would be treated  as  a  draft  evader  if
          returned to Turkey and that his political  activities  in  the  UK
          would place him at risk.


       4. The appeal was heard at Taylor House on 21 June 2019 by First-tier
          Tribunal Judge Blake and dismissed in a determination  promulgated
          on 24 July 2019.  The judge found that the  appellant  was  not  a
          credible witness, that there was little evidence  of  his  support
          for EMEP, which was  a  legally  operating  party,  and  that  his
          activities had been low level and for a short  period.  The  judge
          found that there was little evidence to support the claim  of  the
          appellant's brother's action against the state for  his  dismissal
          from the army, that  there  was  no  evidence  that  he  had  been
          murdered by the state as a result of having taken the  authorities
          to court and  that  in  fact  his  father  still  worked  for  the
          government. There was untranslated  documentary  evidence  and  no
          evidence of the appellant's sur  place  activities  other  than  a
          receipt for ï¿½100 from DAY-MER, a  Turkish  and  Kurdish  community
          organisation in London. The judge found that the articles  in  the
          bundle had been written many years ago and that the appellant  had
          not had any trouble as a result of them. The judge found that  the
          appellant's claim that he would be at risk of ill treatment  as  a
          draft  evader  was  unsustainable  because  he  had  no  political
          profile, his activities in the UK  would  not  bring  him  to  the
          adverse attention of the authorities and his brother's death would
          not be an issue either.


       5. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
          Lever on 27 August 2019 and the matter came before me.


       6. Having heard submissions from the parties, I  found  that  on  the
          appellant's own evidence, his military service had  been  deferred
          until the 31 December 2019 and he has not been called up to serve.
          He had not raised any  issue  of  draft  evasion  in  his  initial
          lengthy witness statement or his asylum interview.  I  found  that
          the judge was entitled to find that there was  no  basis  for  any
          suggestion of  mistreatment  on  that  score  and  preserved  that
          finding.


       7. It was argued for the appellant that the judge  erred  in  finding
          that "there was little evidence to support  the  claim"  that  the
          appellant's bother and family had taken action against the Turkish
          state. It was maintained that the judgment of the  European  Court
          of Human Rights was contained in the respondent's bundle  and  had
          not been acknowledged by the judge. Given that the judgment of the
          court had indeed been before the judge, I concluded that there had
          been a clear error in the judge's  finding  that  the  appellant's
          claim of the court proceedings had not been supported by  evidence
          and on that issue, the determination was found to be flawed.


       8. There  was  no  challenge  to  the  findings  on  the  appellant's
          political activities both in Turkey and in the UK and I  therefore
          preserved the finding that the appellant had been involved in some
          low level activities  with  EMEP  in  Turkey,  that  he  had  some
          activities with DAY-MER in the UK but that his political  profile,
          such as it was, would not cause him any problems on return.


          The Hearing


       9. The appeal hearing then resumed before me on  2  March  2020.  The
          appellant was in attendance and  gave  oral  evidence  through  an
          interpreter he confirmed he understood.


      10. He confirmed his name, address and the  contents  of  his  witness
          statement. He was asked to explain his reference to a  G3  gun  in
          his statement. He said that it was a shotgun which was longer than
          a metre in size. He stated that his brother had been shot  at  the
          back of his skull. He was aware of that from the  autopsy  report.
          He said that an F type prison  was  a  high  security  prison  for
          political prisoners. His brother had been  held  there  for  about
          five months without any charge. He had not been told  why  he  was
          being  held  there;  it  had  been  during  the  period   of   his
          conscription.


      11. The appellant was asked to explain how his second brother had been
          exempted from military service. He  said  that  according  to  the
          regulations  in  Turkey,  the  death  of  a  conscript  meant  the
          exemption of his brothers; all if the death was martyrdom and  one
          if it was not. as his brother was said to have  committed  suicide
          only one brother was exempted from service and that was his second
          brother. He said that the family had been told by  the  army  that
          his brother had not been martyred/killed in action.


      12. The appellant was then tendered  for  cross  examination.  He  was
          asked whether the autopsy report  he  had  referred  to  had  been
          adduced as evidence. The appellant said he had not  submitted  it.
          He confirmed that he did not have the report although he had  read
          it when he was 11 years old. He thought his family  would  have  a
          copy. He said he had also seen his brother's body prior to  burial
          and had seen the head. His parents were aware that he had read the
          report. It had been prepared by the army. He thought  they  should
          still have a copy, but he  could  not  remember  if  it  had  been
          adduced as evidence  before  the  European  Court.  The  appellant
          accepted that the case before the court had been in respect of his
          brother's suspension from officer  training  school  and  not  his
          unlawful killing.


      13. The appellant was asked about the imprisonment of the  lawyer  who
          had represented his brother. He said that he had heard  about  his
          imprisonment about a year ago when it had happened. He  said  that
          he had told his representatives about it  before  and  he  thought
          there was evidence relating to it in the bundle.


      14. The appellant was then  asked  about  a  document  in  the  bundle
          relating to his brother S's application for employment. There  was
          reference to "unfavourable conditions", which the interpreter said
          should have been translated as negative factors,  leading  to  the
          rejection of his application. The appellant was asked if  he  knew
          what those were. He said that it was that they  were  Kurds,  that
          they had gone to the ECHR and that the appellant's oldest  brother
          had been discharged from officer training  school.  There  was  no
          other  letter  to  clarify  what  was  meant  but  the   appellant
          maintained it could be nothing other than their history. S had not
          made any complaint or followed up the refusal. He was asked why  S
          had applied for a public sector job given the family history.  The
          appellant replied that it was more comfortable work.


      15. The appellant confirmed that he had not had any problems obtaining
          his passport.


      16. In re-examination, the appellant was asked why he  had  not  asked
          his parents for a copy of the autopsy report. He said he  did  not
          know. He was asked whether his solicitors had asked him for a copy
          and he said they had not. he confirmed he had told them about it.


      17. The appellant stated that his father used to work as a driver  for
          the local authority but that he  had  now  retired.  He  said  his
          parents,  his  brother  and  his  brother's  family  and  all  the
          relatives lived in Turkey.


      18. I then asked the appellant about his family's circumstances  since
          the ECHR proceedings. He said they had lived "a normal life"  with
          no difficulties but that "we saw the government was building walls
          against us". I asked whether there was any evidence of that  other
          than the letter regarding S's employment. He said there  were  not
          because no other applications for employment  had  been  made.  He
          said his brother worked; he ran a shop. I asked why the  appellant
          would have problems on return. He said it was because he  was  the
          political one. Other than that, he repeated that his brother could
          not get a job. He was working just to survive.


      19. There were no questions arising from mine and that  completed  the
          oral evidence.


      20. I then heard submissions. Mr Whitwell pointed out  that  the  live
          issue was very limited given the preserved findings. He  submitted
          that the evidence about the family lawyer's arrest had been before
          the First-tier Tribunal. It was not  fresh  evidence.  The  letter
          regarding S's job application did not assist one way or the other.
          It was not known what the negative factors  were  and  S  had  not
          received any feedback. He submitted that one had to  look  at  the
          appellant's circumstances. He had obtained a passport to come here
          and had not encountered any adverse questioning.  His  father  had
          been a driver for the local authority until retirement, that was a
          public sector role. There was nothing to show that the family were
          having problems. The appellant claimed that he would  be  at  risk
          due to his political activities but findings had been preserved on
          that. The appellant had delayed making an asylum  claim  for  some
          five months. Whilst it was accepted that he was an Alevi Kurds and
          that they were subject to discrimination, this was insufficient to
          show a risk of persecution. The  only  adverse  factors  were  his
          faith, that he would be returning as a failed asylum  seeker  with
          an expired passport. He had no criminal record and had never  been
          arrested or detained. There was no clear correlation  between  the
          appellant's brother's case and any risk to him. The court judgment
          only addressed the issue of the brother's expulsion from  training
          school and not with his death. The appeal should be dismissed.


      21. Ms Shaw relied on her skeleton argument. She pointed out that  the
          court judgment had listed the appellant by  name  along  with  his
          family  and  they  had   al   been   the   subject   of   security
          investigations.  She submitted that the evidence showed that there
          were negative or unfavourable factors in respect of S which  meant
          that he could not get a job so there  could  be  similar  negative
          factors in respect of  the  appellant.  There  was  a  distinction
          between S and the appellant in that the appellant was  not  exempt
          from military service unlike S. She referred me to the Home Office
          Country Report on exemption and to the document from the  military
          deferring the appellant's military service whilst he was  studying
          until 31 December 2019. The appellant had given  evidence  on  how
          his brother had died. He would now have to  return  and  undertake
          military service. His dead brother had  been  held  in  a  F  type
          prison and was never given a fair trial. He had been killed whilst
          serving. His lawyer had been arrested on allegations of terrorism.
          The appeal should be allowed.


      22. That concluded the hearing.   I  then  reserved  my  determination
          which I now give with reasons.


          Discussion and Conclusions


      23. In reaching my decision, I have considered all  the  evidence  and
          the submissions made. I have had regard to the lower  standard  of
          proof and the fact that the burden is on the appellant to make out
          his case.


      24. I would state at the outset that this has been  a  very  difficult
          case to decide as it is brought on a very unusual premise and  the
          evidence both for and against the appellant makes it a  borderline
          case to determine. However, bearing in mind that the threshold  is
          a low one and that much of the evidence  I  have  to  consider  is
          undisputed, I conclude for the reasons set out below (in no  order
          of priority) that the appellant has just made out his case.


      25. References to RB are to the respondent's  bundle,  to  AB  to  the
          appellant's bundle and to ASB  to  the  appellant's  supplementary
          bundle.


      26. The appellant sought and obtained a visit visa for  the  UK  on  4
          October 2017. He left just  two  days  later  on  6  October  2017
          arriving here the same day as shown in the passport endorsement. I
          find, therefore, he left Turkey at the first available opportunity
          having obtained his visa.


      27. The appellant claimed asylum on 3 April 2018. He was  asked  about
          this delay at his asylum interview and there as  well  as  in  his
          witness statements he  explained that he had  been  depressed  and
          psychologically unwell on arrival and that it  took  him  time  to
          pull himself together and to feel ready to  make  the  application
          (RB:C20:219-222 and AB:12, paragraph  29).  I  note  that  in  the
          discussion with the interviewing  officer  about  his  health,  it
          transpired that he had  not  realised  he  was  entitled  to  seek
          medical help here and had not  done  so.  I  note  that  he  later
          confirms that he had sought help and  was  on  medication  (AB:12,
          paragraph 30). I also note that the  psychiatric  report,  adduced
          for the First-tier Tribunal hearing, confirms that  the  appellant
          suffers from chronic PTSD (RB:Annex E). I  find,  therefore,  that
          the delay in making the claim is satisfactorily explained and does
          not adversely impact upon the credibility of  the  appellant.   In
          any event, I note that it is unclear  as  to  when  the  appellant
          first contacted the Home Office in order to make his  application;
          at his asylum interview he refers to the 3 April 2018 as being the
          date he had been given for his screening appointment (RB:C30:221).
          Some contact was plainly made before this date.


      28. It is accepted that the appellant is an Alevi Kurd. I note that he
          was born in Altindag which is in  the  Ankara  district  (this  is
          confirmed  by  the  appellant's  passport,  the  letter  from  the
          military and at RB:B2:1.9 and D1:2). His  parents,  however,  were
          both born in Sivas (RB:D1:5) and I find that is why the  appellant
          views himself as emanating from that region (RB:C11:28,  C29:206).
          The notice from  the  Ministry  of  Defence  also  refers  to  the
          appellant's place of registry as Sivas, despite his place of birth
          being elsewhere (AB:22) and the family  are  registered  as  being
          from Imranli district in Sivas (ASB:26-27).


      29. I note that the appellant's father used to work in  the  mines  in
          Konya and that his brothers were both  born  there  but  that  the
          family eventually settled in Ankara in  1988  (RB:D2:10-11,  D1:3)
          when  Kurds  were  moved  from  their  villages  by  the   Turkish
          authorities  in  an  attempt  to   encourage   assimilation.   The
          appellant's father then found work  as  a  driver  for  the  local
          authority of Cankaya municipality in Ankara (RB:D1:4) and remained
          in employment until his retirement.


      30. The appellant is the youngest of three brothers and I refer to the
          others as M and S. It is  accepted  that  M  entered  the  Beytepe
          School of Specialised Gendarmerie in 2001 and that shortly  before
          his graduation in 2002 he was dismissed without  being  given  any
          reasons. I have had careful regard to the judgment from  the  ECHR
          which found in his favour and awarded damages to be  paid  to  his
          family.  Whilst  this  aspect  of  the  claim  was  noted  by  the
          respondent in her  summary  of  the  appellant's  claim  (decision
          letter: paragraphs 14-15), there was no consideration of it at all
          when the claim was assessed.


      31. The omission was highlighted by the appellant's representatives on
          21 December 2018 when they filed notice of appeal. However, it was
          not suggested by Mr Whitwell that the appellant's claim  that  the
          family was known to the authorities because of this litigation was
          unfounded. Nor is there any challenge to the finding of the  court
          and the appellant's claim  that  M's  expulsion  from  the  school
          occurred after the collation of findings of a secret investigation
          into him and his family (RB:F3: paragraph 7). Mr Whitwell also did
          not challenge the appellant's evidence that their  neighbours  had
          been questioned about the appellant's family's political views  by
          Turkish secret service agents prior to M's expulsion (RB:D3:22 and
          C15:65).  The   ECHR   judgment   refers   to   the   confidential
          investigation conducted by the secret  intelligence  service,  the
          Directorate of Security and the Gendarmerie Command (RB:F3:7).


      32. It is accepted that whilst the proceedings  were  ongoing,  M  was
          conscripted  in  February  2005.  the   appellant's   unchallenged
          evidence is that the family  heard  regularly  from  him  and  all
          seemed well. M told his family that  he  would  speak  to  Kurdish
          activists and  prisoners  in  the  F-type  high  security  prisons
          (RB:D4:26-28). The last contact with M was on 31 August 2005. On 8
          September 2005, the appellant's father was  called  to  the  local
          Mukhtar's office and informed of his son's death (RB:D4). M was 23
          years old.


      33. Other than  the  appellant's  evidence,  there  is  no  supporting
          evidence as to the cause of M's  death.   The  appellant's  family
          were told by officials that M had committed  suicide  by  shooting
          himself with his G3 rifle. The  appellant  states  that  this  was
          disputed by the family for several reasons: M was shot in the back
          of the head; a G3 (Gewehr 3) rifle is just over a metre  long  and
          it would be hard to use it to  shoot  oneself;  M  had  been  well
          during his service and his contact with his  family  had  revealed
          nothing untoward as to his  mental  state;  M  was  not  permitted
          ammunition due to his past  history  and  concern  that  he  might
          harbour a grudge (RB:D4:35); it was said that he  had  stolen  one
          bullet from the armoury but the armoury was heavily  guarded;  the
          death was said to have occurred inside a high security prison  but
          was reportedly out of reach of any  of  the  surveillance  cameras
          (RB:C15;62); the autopsy report confirmed the shot was to the back
          of the skull, and lastly the appellant and his family saw M's body
          at the burial and saw the extensive damage to his head.


      34. The appellant stated that the autopsy report had been seen by  him
          and his family.  He was not questioned as to when he, himself, had
          read it as he had been a child of 11 at the time of his  brother's
          death and would probably  have  not  understood  much  of  such  a
          report. However, he said that his family had been in possession of
          it and it is possible that he read  it  later  on.  Unfortunately,
          this report was not made available for the hearing. The  appellant
          thought his family should still have it and it is unclear why  his
          representatives did not ask him to obtain it, if of course such  a
          document was safe to send.  It was not, however, suggested or  put
          to him that he did not see injuries to  his  brother's  skull,  as
          described. The appellant stated that this was  something  that  he
          would never forget and that would always remain  with  him  and  I
          accept that the experience has had long lasting impact on  him.  I
          note  that  the  psychiatrist  in  his  report  noted   that   the
          appellant's "voice became choked and there were tears in his eyes"
          when he spoke of this (RB:E4:20) and he was visibly distressed  at
          the hearing before me when questioned about this event.


      35. I accept that due to the military's conclusion as to the cause  of
          M's death, M was not declared to be a martyr and  his  family  did
          not benefit from any state benefits that would have  been  payable
          had he died in other circumstances. I also accept that only S  was
          exempted from military service due to M's death and not both S and
          the appellant as would have been the case had  the  official  line
          not been suicide. Although the extract Ms Shaw cited from the CPIN
          (AB:at 4.1.1 is rather unclear as to who would be exempted in such
          circumstances), it is plain from the notice  about  the  appellant
          from the Ministry of Defence in Ankara  dated  13  February  2018,
          that his conscription has been deferred  because  of  his  studies
          until 31 December 2019 (AB:22). The ability of students  to  defer
          national service until completion of their university studies  (as
          long  as  they  are  not  older  than  35)  is  confirmed  in  the
          respondent's evidence (AB:CPIN: 3.3.3 and 2.1.1).


      36. It follows that I accept, and there has been no challenge to this,
          that the appellant enrolled at university in 2012 to study geology
          but "froze" his studies in February 2017 in the aftermath  of  the
          attempted coup on September 2016 when a  state  of  emergency  was
          declared and when the Kurds came under close scrutiny  (RB:D9).  I
          accept that the  appellant's  mother  was  diagnosed  with  cancer
          around this time.


      37. I accept that M's death motivated the appellant to become involved
          in Kurdish politics and that he had some bad experiences  such  as
          when he  was  shot  by  rubber  bullets  in  September  2013  when
          attending protests in Ankara and was held in police van  for  1  -
          1.5 hours, beaten, threatened and abused and  suffered  damage  to
          his teeth (RB: C23-24, C23:157, C24:160, D6:51).  There  was  also
          the time in September 2015 when he was present at  a  rally  where
          bombs killed many people including some of  his  friends  (RB:D8).
          Following the attempted coup and the general crackdown,  I  accept
          that he began to have problems at university where he was labelled
          a communist and a terrorist (RB:D9).


      38. By February 2017 the appellant was  fearful  enough  that  he  had
          stopped attending university, deferred his studies and remained at
          home until May 2017 when he fled  to  his  uncle's  hotel  in  the
          extreme west of Turkey  hoping  to  escape  the  political  unrest
          (RB:D10). Although the respondent questioned this conduct  in  the
          decision letter, I accept that Gï¿½kï¿½eada island (in  the  Gallipoli
          Peninsula), a popular tourist destination with its  Greek  origins
          is seen as a "laid back" part of Turkey  and  I  accept  that  the
          appellant thought he might be able to lose himself  there  amongst
          the guests in his uncle's hotel business. I also accept  that  due
          to the military presence following  the  coup  and  the  state  of
          emergency, he still felt nervous and that he was worried about how
          his presence might impact on his uncle if he was noticed (RB:D10).
          I accept that on his return home, he three out all  his  political
          literature so as not to arouse any suspicion and that he  felt  he
          had to leave Turkey.


      39. I have no evidence that the appellant has been in touch  with  the
          military authorities since his service was deferred. Nor is  there
          any evidence as to what has happened about his university studies.
          The appellant's evidence was that the authorities had been to  his
          home and questioned his father about his whereabouts  (RB:C31:227-
          229). No challenge to this has been raised.


      40. According to the CPIN (September 2018), records are kept of  those
          liable to military service and anyone who seeks  to  evade  it  is
          registered on the GBTS national information system and  is  likely
          to come to the attention of the authorities during routine  police
          checks and border checks. They are also likely to be searched  for
          at their home address (2.4.16). It is reported that  the  national
          database of military  service  is  sophisticated,  making  evasion
          almost impossible (7.3.1). Branches of the military are located in
          every district and every male citizen is registered there at birth
          (7.3.2). The bar code on a passport  is  linked  to  the  person's
          entry on  the  GBTS  which  includes  information  about  military
          (ibid). the imprisonment terms for draft evasion are  set  out  at
          7.5.2. They vary in length depending on  the  period  of  evasion.
          Given that the appellant has not reported to the  military  office
          as required to do after 31 December 2019, he is now  reaching  the
          three month point which carries a sentence of 4-18 months or  6-36
          months for anything over 3 months.


      41. It is accepted that the appellant had been involved in  low  level
          politics with EMEP and  DAY-MER.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
          found that his political activities would not  raise  any  adverse
          interest in him and that finding is  preserved.  However,  I  find
          that there is a likelihood that when combined with the other  risk
          factors they would bring the appellant to  the  attention  of  the
          authorities particularly as he will already  be  in  their  sights
          being of conscription age and just having completed the  deferment
          period.


      42. I accept that the lawyer who acted for M and  the  family  in  the
          ECHR proceedings was imprisoned in 2019 however although raised by
          Ms Shaw at the start of the hearing, this is not a  new  fact  and
          was mentioned by appellant in his earlier evidence. Indeed it does
          not appear to be the first arrest as  the  appellant  referred  to
          "consistent arrests" in the past (RB:D3:24). There  is  no  direct
          connection between the lawyer's  problems  and  any  risk  to  the
          appellant.


      43.  I  accept  that  S  applied  for  employment  with  the   General
          Directorate of Machinery and Chemistry Industry  Institution.  The
          letter submitted to confirm this is dated 2  July  2019  and  also
          confirms that S passed the examination and interview stage of  the
          employment process on 18 July 2018 (ASB:23 and 25). The  appellant
          gave evidence that the employer was in the public sector and  that
          was not challenged. The letter then  maintains  that  following  a
          security investigation and archive research results, the offer  of
          employment was withdrawn due  to  "unfavourable  conditions".  The
          interpreter at the  hearing  suggested  this  should  be  read  as
          "negative factors" but the meaning is more or less the same. It is
          the appellant's belief, and of course there can  be  no  certainty
          given the absence of any further  information  about  the  matter,
          that these  negative/unfavourable  factors  must  be  their  Alevi
          background, the previous security investigation conducted  on  the
          family and M's history.


      44. Mr Whitwell submitted that there was no evidence  to  confirm  the
          appellant's assumption and that it was only speculation  that  the
          negative factors were as he surmised however he made no  reference
          to the police check report on S which is also before me  (ASB:28).
          That confirms that a police check on S conducted  on  18  December
          2019 disclosed no criminal history. The negative conditions cannot
          relate to S's work experience of  qualifications  as  those  would
          have been known to the employer at the time of the application for
          work  and  certainly  during  the  course  of  the  interview  and
          examination process.  Whilst I too can only speculate on  what  is
          meant by the phrase,  it  is,  in  my  view,  and  given  all  the
          circumstances and evidence, fair to draw  the  inference  that  it
          relates to the family's known  background  which  the  authorities
          view adversely.


      45. Mr Whitwell submitted that the appellant's father was able to hold
          down his job with the local authority notwithstanding this adverse
          history however the appellant's father is an elderly man  and  was
          close to retirement. It may be that he was not viewed as a threat.


      46. It was submitted for the respondent that the  appellant  had  been
          able to obtain a passport through the normal channels and to leave
          Turkey using his passport. At the time of his departure,  however,
          the appellant had obtained deferral of  his  service  due  to  his
          studies (as he was entitled to) and so there would  have  been  no
          reason to deny him a passport. It may be seen, however,  that  the
          passport was valid for only a two year period (until  April  2019)
          and has now expired.


      47. It was also submitted that the appellant's brother S was  able  to
          remain in Turkey and work without problems. That work is  said  to
          be in a shop and previously as a labourer. His attempt  to  obtain
          more skilled work has failed. I  accept,  nevertheless,  that  the
          family has not been directly harassed  or  persecuted  and  indeed
          notwithstanding the discrimination they faced over the  years,  as
          detailed in the appellant's statement (RB:D2-3) and interview,  he
          did not seek to exaggerate their circumstances and  admitted  they
          were living a normal life.


      48. The major difference, however, between the appellant, his  parents
          and S is that the appellant has been  away  from  Turkey,  he  has
          allowed  his  passport  and  the  postponement   period   of   his
          conscription to expire and he has failed to report to the military
          office as he was required to do. As it has now  been  three  years
          since he "froze" his studies, he may well be perceived  as  having
          abandoned them and so  he  would  be  required  to  serve  in  the
          military on his return. Whilst there have been recent  changes  to
          the exemption provisions and an option to pay  one's  way  out  of
          military service has been introduced, I was not addressed on  this
          and neither party submitted any evidence on the  current  position
          or how it might impact upon  the  appellant.  I  have,  therefore,
          reached my decision on the evidence that was made available.


      49. I accept completely that the appellant has a valid subjective fear
          given what happened to his  brother  when  he  undertook  military
          service. That is hardly surprising. The more  difficult  issue  to
          determine is whether the fear was well founded objectively.


      50. I have sought to analyse above  all  the  evidence  both  for  and
          against the  appellant.  I  accept  that  the  appellant's  father
          remained in  employment  until  his  retirement,  that  no  active
          attempts have  been  made  to  harass  the  family  and  that  the
          appellant's parents and older  brother  are  living  a  relatively
          normal life. I find, nevertheless, that given  the  low  threshold
          the appellant has just made out his  case.  This  is  because  his
          circumstances are significantly different from those of his father
          and brother, because he is now of an age where he is  required  to
          serve in the army, because his brother's history will be known  to
          the military, because he is now under their radar given the expiry
          of his deferral period, because enquiries have been  made  of  his
          whereabouts at the family home and because  there  is  an  adverse
          record of the appellant and his family on  state  records.  S  may
          have escaped a troublesome fate  by  being  exempt  from  national
          service but the appellant has not been so lucky. His own political
          past, which appears to have been known at university and thus  may
          be  known  to  the  authorities,  is  a   further   factor   which
          distinguishes him from S as does his departure from Turkey and the
          making  of  an  asylum  claim.  Whilst  these  factors   may   not
          individually place him at risk, when taken cumulatively  they  are
          sufficient to discharge the burden on the appellant to  the  lower
          standard.  I would also add that there has  been  little,  if  any
          challenge to the appellant's account and that I have accepted  him
          as a credible witness.


      51. The First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appeal  on  humanitarian
          protection grounds  and  no  challenge  to  that  was  made.  That
          decision is upheld.


      52. No article 8 claim has been put forward.


          Decision

      53. The appeal is allowed on asylum grounds.


      54. The appeal is allowed on article 3 grounds.


          Anonymity


      55. I continue the anonymity order made by the First-tier Tribunal.
