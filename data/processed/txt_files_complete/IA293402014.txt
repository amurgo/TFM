                            DECISION AND REASONS
                                FINAL HEARING

    1. These proceedings arise from  the  appeal  of  Janakan  Nadarajah,  a
       citizen of Sri Lanka born 20 June 1976, against the decision  of  the
       Secretary of State of 8 July 2014 to refuse  his  application  for  a
       residence card confirming his right of residence based on  being  the
       spouse of his French wife Rathini Pankiras. The  First-tier  Tribunal
       having allowed the appeal, the Secretary of State now appeals to  the
       Upper Tribunal with permission.

    2. The application was originally refused because of suspicions held  by
       the Secretary of State that the marriage was one of convenience,  and
       additionally because no valid identity document  had  been  provided:
       "there is no reason why a new, valid Sri Lankan  passport  cannot  be
       obtained by yourself."

    3. The First-tier Tribunal accepted  the  reality  of  the  relationship
       between the couple, and went on to find that there  was  satisfactory
       evidence before it that Mr Nadarajah had handed in  his  passport  to
       the interviewing officer at his asylum interview, and concluded  that
       this disposed of the issue of his possession  of  a  valid  passport,
       notwithstanding that it was unclear whether the  document  was  still
       valid.

    4. The Secretary of State  appealed,  Judge  Pooler  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal granting permission on 13  February  2015,  because  it  was
       arguable that the Appellant had failed to produce a valid document.

    5. At the error of law hearing Ms Willocks-Briscoe relied on the grounds
       of appeal  as  endorsed  by  the  grant  of  permission,  essentially
       contending that it had been Mr Nadarajah's responsibility to  produce
       a valid passport whereas Mr Murphy argued that there was no  material
       error of law here, as the Secretary of State was  not  disputing  his
       identity.

    6. Regulation 17 of The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations
       2006 provides:
           "(1) The Secretary of State must issue a  residence  card  to  a
           person who is not an EEA national and is the family member of  a
           qualified person or of an EEA national with a permanent right of
           residence under regulation 15 on application and production  of-
           (a) a valid passport; and (b) proof that the applicant is such a
           family member."

    7. Regulation 29A of addresses "Alternative  evidence  of  identity  and
       nationality" and provides that, subject to a scenario not within  the
       scope of this appeal, that "where a provision  of  these  Regulations
       requires a person to hold or produce a valid identity card issued  by
       an EEA State or a valid passport the Secretary of  State  may  accept
       alternative evidence of identity and nationality where the person  is
       unable  to  obtain  or  produce  the   required   document   due   to
       circumstances beyond his or her control."

    8. I found that the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  indeed
       flawed by error of law. The provision of a passport is a  requirement
       of an application for a residence card. The discretion to relieve  an
       Applicant of the obligation  of  so  doing  applies  only  where  its
       production  is  not  possible  due  to   circumstances   beyond   the
       applicant's control. This is not simply a matter of domestic  law  as
       the requirement finds it basis in the Citizens Directive, Article  10
       of which addresses the issue of residence cards stating  at  10(2)(a)
       that "Member States  shall  require  presentation  of  the  following
       documents ... a valid passport".

    9. The First-tier Tribunal assumed, without any  evidential  foundation,
       that the passport remained valid (or alternatively treated the matter
       as irrelevant), notwithstanding the statement in the  refusal  letter
       that the application could only be  granted  if  "a  new,  valid  Sri
       Lankan passport" was provided. The expiry of his passport is a matter
       that can reasonably be supposed to have been within the knowledge  of
       the Appellant, and yet he provided no  evidence  as  to  why  he  was
       unable to obtain a new passport from his  national  authorities.  The
       First-tier Tribunal failed to direct its mind to the requirements  of
       Regulation 29A.

   10. A further witness statement was supplied at the appeal hearing  which
       set out that the Appellant having been issued an entry clearance on 2
       December 2008, the Entry Clearance Officer having been  satisfied  as
       to his identity. He handed over his passport on 30 May 2012  when  he
       sought asylum and was given an asylum registration card. He  went  to
       the High Commission of Sri Lanka to apply for a new passport. He  had
       learned that the Home Office's policy was not  to  release  documents
       for a person who had been refused asylum.

   11. At the continuation  hearing  the  Appellant  gave  evidence.  Having
       adopted his witness statement which set out his  failed  attempts  to
       obtain documentation from the Sri Lankan  High  Commission,  he  said
       that when he attended that office  they  were  satisfied  as  to  his
       identity but still maintained they required a letter  from  the  Home
       Office or proof of his lawful residence in the United Kingdom  before
       issuing him with a new passport. His solicitors had  written  to  the
       Presenting Officers Unit asking for his passport to  be  returned  to
       him or for some other facilitation of his efforts (there was indeed a
       letter to such effect provided in the Appellant's bundle)  but  there
       had been no reply. He felt that there was more that he  could  do  to
       progress his attempt to obtain a passport.

   12. Cross examined he confirmed that he provided his old passport to  the
       Home Office when he claimed asylum: it had expired in  May  2012.  He
       confirmed that he had been refused asylum and excluded  from  refugee
       status due to  his  LTTE  activities,  the  appeal  originally  being
       allowed to a limited extent leaving the decision  outstanding  before
       the Home Office, against whose re-refusal he did not appeal.  He  had
       given all his available  documents  to  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities
       including his identity card. They had not justified their refusal  to
       help him on the grounds that he was a LTTE member.

   13. Mr Tufan submitted  that  it  was  improbable  that  the  Appellant's
       national authorities would not issue him  with  a  passport:  it  was
       unclear why they would need the confirmation from another  government
       of his legal status before issuing such  a  document.  There  was  no
       expert evidence to confirm that this was their likely stance. He  had
       never had a valid passport in this country. If it was  accepted  that
       there was a  valid  reason  calling  into  play  the  Regulation  29A
       discretion, then this should  be  remitted  to  the  Home  Office  to
       reconsider, given that arguably the Respondent had not exercised  the
       discretion hitherto. Mr Murphy submitted that the Appellant was in  a
       "Catch 22" situation, caught between the authorities of Sri Lanka and
       the United Kingdom who between them had failed to advance his wish to
       document himself.

Findings and reasons

   14. Having heard oral evidence, and bearing in mind  that  the  Appellant
       was previously accepted as credible in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  I
       accept the account that he has advanced of his difficulties with  the
       Sri  Lankan  authorities.  I  do  not  consider  there  is   anything
       inherently surprising about them insisting upon  seeing  evidence  of
       lawful residence in the United Kingdom before issuing a new document:
       officialdom the world over is known to insist on formalities of  this
       nature. Nobody familiar with  immigration  appeals  (or  indeed  with
       unlawful detention claims) can fail to be aware of  the  difficulties
       that individuals often face in satisfying their national  authorities
       of their entitlement to a passport: even the Secretary of State often
       fails   to   secure   the   cooperation   of   foreign    authorities
       notwithstanding her best efforts.

   15. In this appeal the Home  Office  has  not  answered  the  Appellant's
       request  to  support  his  application,  and  so  have  not  assisted
       themselves in preventing him from satisfying the burden of  proof  to
       show, on balance of probabilities, that he is unable  to  obtain  the
       required document due to circumstances beyond his control.  I accept,
       therefore,  that  the  decision  maker  should  have  considered  the
       Regulation 29A discretion.

   16. When one reviews the  original  refusal  letter,  Regulation  29A  is
       cited, so it is clear that the Respondent was alive to its  potential
       exercise:  but  no  affirmative  discretion  was  exercised  in   the
       Appellant's favour.  So  this  is  not  an  appeal  where  the  Upper
       Tribunal's powers are limited to allowing the appeal because  of  the
       original decision's failure to accord with the law; it can review the
       exercise of discretion by the Home Office, by analogy with  Aladeselu
       and Others (2006  Regs  -  reg  8)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  00253(IAC)
       referencing another discretion within the EEA  Regulations  at  [31]:
       "Whilst we can consider whether a  discretionary  power  should  have
       been exercised differently, we cannot seek to do that if there has as
       yet been no exercise of that power."

   17. It seems to me that the discretion should have been exercised in  the
       Appellant's favour, given that he has done all within  his  power  to
       secure the relevant document, in circumstances where the Secretary of
       State has never disputed his identity and yet failed to herself issue
       a letter that might have resolved the difficulties far sooner.
