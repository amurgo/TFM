                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms K Joshi (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Randall dismissing his appeal under the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 against the decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse him a  card  confirming  his  permanent  right  of
    residence.

 2. The appellant is an Algerian national who was married to  a  Portuguese
    national who at all material times, and at least since 2008, has worked
    for the NHS.  A large number of documents were put in both with  regard
    to her employment and also to the subsistence and genuineness of  their
    marriage.

 3. The Secretary of State refused the application for grounds on the basis
    which appear, to say the least, confused.  The  refusal  notice  itself
    states:

         "You have applied for Permanent Residence on the basis that you are
         the family member of an EEA national and you have resided in the UK
         with that EEA national in accordance with the EEA Regulations for a
         continuous period of  5  years.   However  you  have  not  provided
         evidence that the EEA national resided in the UK in accordance with
         those Regulations during that 5 year period."

    There is no mention in that of the  allegation  which  appears  in  the
    refusal letter (also dated 1 June 2018) in which no issue is taken with
    the spouse's employment history.  It is recorded that she had  produced
    pay slips from 2008 to 2015, numbers of P60s, P45 and  so  on,  but  no
    issue was taken with that.  Instead the bulk of the reasoning  is  that
    this was a marriage of convenience.

 4. The appellant was represented before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  by  Ms
    Joshi who appears also today.

 5. There was a substantial amount of evidence put before the judge  as  to
    the nature of the marriage, and he was persuaded that this  was  not  a
    marriage of convenience.

 6. It is of note that although the judge  does  go  into  some  detail  in
    recording the submissions made on behalf  of  the  respondent  and  the
    appellant, it does not appear that the  Secretary  of  State  took  any
    point as to whether or not the sponsor was  working  or  not.   Despite
    that, the judge found that it had not been a  marriage  of  convenience
    but was not satisfied by the evidence that the sponsor had been working
    for a continuous five year period.

 7. At paragraph [16] of his decision the judge directs  himself  that  the
    appellant succeeds if can show that his partner  is  exercising  treaty
    rights as a worker for any five year period during the formal existence
    of their marriage, i.e. that between 24 February 2011 and 9 March 2017.
     If so the issue of a  retained  right  of  residence  did  not  arise.
    Alternatively if the appellant wished to rely on the period  after  the
    divorce, then the issue of whether he has a retained right of residence
    may arise.

 8. The judge directed himself at [17(a)] that income prior to the date  of
    marriage was not relevant and at (b) noted that  the  appellant's  wife
    had a combined income in the tax year 2010-2011 of ï¿½17,000.  The  judge
    then goes on at paragraph [18] to  say  why  he  does  not  accept  the
    evidence; and, that he is not  satisfied  by  the  documents  that  the
    appellant is self-employed or was otherwise  exercising  treaty  rights
    and therefore did not have a retained right of residence.

 9. There are two principal grounds of appeal.

      i) that the judge committed a procedural error  in  that  he  had  not
         raised the issue properly with the parties as to whether or not, as
         appears to be the case, the Secretary of State was  not  taking  in
         issue as to whether the sponsor had been employed  for  a  relevant
         period; and, in the alternative,

     ii) that the judge erred in not having proper regard  to  the  evidence
         and the correct test when assessing  that  the  appellant  had  not
         retained a right of residence.

10. Ms Pal conceded that there was an error of law. She did so having heard
    the submissions, and in the light of  the  documentary  evidence;  and,
    also in the light of my observations that the judge  appeared  to  have
    misdirected himself in holding that the fact that the wife was  working
    prior to the date of marriage was not relevant.  It  was  relevant  for
    this reason: if the wife had been working from 2008  onwards  then  she
    would herself have acquired a permanent right of residence by operation
    of law in 2013 and any requirement to show she was working  after  that
    would not be relevant because she was resident  under  the  Regulations
    lawfully as a person who had acquired the permanent right of residence.
     It appears also that the judge then misdirected himself  in  excluding
    evidence which was relevant.

11. Having announced that I was going to set aside the decision the parties
    were in  agreement  that  there  was  sufficient  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal to show that  the  appellant's  ex-wife  had  been  exercising
    treaty  rights  for  the  relevant  period  and  that  accordingly  the
    appellant was entitled to a card and had acquired the  permanent  right
    of residence as he had been resident in the United Kingdom with his now
    ex-wife  and  for  these  reasons  he  met  the  requirements  of   the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations.  Accordingly  I  will
    allow the appeal on that basis.

12. In summary, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
    making of an error of law and I set it aside.  I remake it by  allowing
    the appeal under the EEA Regulations 2016.
