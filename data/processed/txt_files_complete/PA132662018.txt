For the Appellant:     Mr Head, Montague Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of  Afghanistan  whose  year  of  birth  is
    agreed to be 2002.  He appeals with  permission  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge JC Hamilton) to dismiss his  protection  and
    human rights appeal.








    Anonymity Order

 2. This case concerns a claim for  international  protection,  made  by  a
    minor. Having had regard to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1  of  2013:
    Anonymity Orders we therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order
    in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"



      Background and Matters in Issue


 3. The basis of the Appellant's protection and  human  rights  claims  was
    that he faced a well-founded fear of  persecution  in  Afghanistan  for
    reasons of his membership of a particular social group  (children/young
    person) and imputed  political  opinion  (persecution  by  the  Taliban
    because family regarded as 'collaborators').  The Appellant states that
    his father worked for a company who were contracted to supply parts  to
    the American led coalition, and that  as  a  result  he  was  shot  and
    injured in 2014. The Appellant himself was then kidnapped and held in a
    Taliban training camp before  managing  to  escape.   The  family  were
    subsequently threatened, and  the  family  home  attacked.   The  whole
    family fled Afghanistan, but were separated on the journey.


 4. The Respondent, by his letter dated the 11th  November  2018,  had  not
    challenged the evidence that the Appellant left Afghanistan sometime in
    2016 (when he was 14). It further appears to have  been  accepted  that
    the Appellant is from Paktia, and that he is  Shi'a.  Beyond  that  the
    claim was rejected for want of credibility.


 5. On appeal to the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant relied  on  his  own
    oral evidence, and that of his maternal uncle, 'AS'. He further  relied
    on a series of documents which he said had been provided to him by  his
    relatives in Afghanistan. The Appellant asserted that  these  documents
    were:

           a) Letters from the two companies where his father was  employed
              (AMS and OKS);
           b) Evidence downloaded online about those two  companies  (found
              in the 'supplementary bundle');
           c) A threatening letter from the Taliban dated 4th August 2015;
           d) A letter from the Ministry of the Interior dated 7th November
              2015,  giving   detail   about   the   Appellant's   father's
              employment;
           e) A photograph of his father with some westerners  including  a
              soldier;
           f) A photograph of his father after he was shot in 2014;
           g)  A  photograph  of  members  of  the  family,  including  the
              Appellant and his father;
           h)   A   'discharge   summary'   relating   to   his    mother's
              hospitalisation after the attack on the family home;
           i) A letter from a witness 'SR' who avers that he  travelled  to
              Afghanistan in August  2018  and  met  with  the  Appellant's
              cousin who provided him with document (h) above.


 6. The Tribunal's findings begin at paragraph 65 of the determination.  It
    properly  directed  itself  to  bear  in  mind,  at  the  outset,   the
    Appellant's young age, and the fact that many of  the  events  narrated
    occurred when he was only 12/13.  For this reason  the  Tribunal  found
    many of the adverse credibility submissions made by the  Respondent  to
    be without foundation. It was  satisfied,  for  instance,  that  little
    turned on the fact that the Appellant was vague about the nature of his
    father's employment, or who exactly he had worked for [see �67-68].


 7. The Tribunal nevertheless went on to dismiss the  appeal  having  found
    the account overall to be "contradictory and implausible" and rejecting
    the claim that the  Taliban  targeted  the  Appellant  and  his  family
    [�112].





    The Grounds of Appeal


 8. The Appellant contends that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is
    flawed for the following material errors of law:


              I) Failure to consider  material  objective  evidence  in  the
                 'supplementary bundle' (item (b) above). In particular:


                 The Appellant supplied objective evidence to  confirm  that
                 AMS had a presence in the Appellant's home town of  Gardez,
                 Paktia, and that  they  supplied  vehicle  parts  and  were
                 contracted to maintain vehicles for  the  Afghani  National
                 Police. He further supplied a 'LinkedIn'  profile  relating
                 to a man named Wahidullah Radmanish, this being the claimed
                 signatory  to  the  document  confirming  the   Appellant's
                 father's  employment  (one  of  items  (a)  above).   Other
                 documents relied upon in this  bundle  confirmed  that  the
                 American army has  a  presence  in  Gardez,  that  'Ranger'
                 vehicles are used there, as mentioned by the  Appellant  at
                 his interview, and that there is a high rate  of  insurgent
                 activity in Paktia.


                 It is submitted that the Tribunal erred in failing to  take
                 any of this material into account.




             II)  Failure  to  consider  the  country  background   material
                 relating  to  forced  recruitment  by   the   Taliban.   In
                 particular:


                 The Appellant had placed reliance on the UNHCR  eligibility
                 guidelines  which  demonstrated  that  the  Taliban  use  a
                 variety of means to recruit young people. It  is  submitted
                 that had that evidence been considered, it is  likely  that
                 the First-tier Tribunal would have regarded the Appellant's
                 account  as  positively  consistent  with   the   objective
                 material, as opposed to inconsistent or unlikely.


            III) Failure to have regard to the  Appellant's  evidence  about
                 his father's employment. In particular:


                 The First-tier Tribunal identified what it  regarded  as  a
                 discrepancy  in  that  items   (a)   indicated   that   the
                 Appellant's father ceased employment in  2013  whereas  the
                 Appellant said that he was still  supplying  parts  to  the
                 American forces as late as  2015.  There  was  in  fact  no
                 discrepancy in the evidence, which was that the Appellant's
                 father had his own spare parts shop and continued this self-
                 employment after he had ceased paid employment


             IV) Failure to  address  submissions  made  that  the  security
                 situation in  Kabul  had  further  deteriorated  since  the
                 promulgation of AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG  [2018]
                 UKUT 00118 (IAC).



    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings


 9. For the Respondent Mr Bramble accepted that the decision was flawed for
    material error of law. In particular he accepted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had overlooked more contemporary evidence on the likelihood of
    adolescent boys being forcibly recruited by the Taliban, and  that  the
    determination appears  to  overlook  the  materials  contained  in  the
    supplementary bundle.  He further accepted that ground (III)  was  made
    out: the Tribunal has not addressed the Appellant's evidence  that  his
    father continued to supply car parts in self-employed capacity.


10. Given the Secretary of State's concession we can be  brief  in  stating
    our reasons.


11. In respect of ground (I) We accept that none of the  material  at  item
    (b), ie the objective material in the supplementary bundle, appears  to
    have been considered by the First-tier Tribunal.    That  evidence  was
    important because it went to whether or not the Appellant's father  did
    actually  work  for  the  'Americans'  (we  use  this   term   loosely,
    recognising that some of the departments concerned  may  in  fact  have
    been Afghani security services).  The First-tier Tribunal does  express
    "concerns about the reliability" of the letters at item (a) but  beyond
    that there is no clear finding on whether the Appellant's father was so
    employed.  Indeed it went to on to accept that the man pictured in  the
    family photographs at item (g) was the Appellant's father, and that  he
    was the same man posing with westerners including  a  man  in  military
    fatigues at item (e).    Having made that link it failed to proceed  to
    make a clear finding  one  way  or  the  other.  That  was  a  material
    omission. The assertion that the Appellant's father is perceived  as  a
    'collaborator' was central to the Appellant's case.

12. In respect of ground (II), and the Appellant's account of kidnapping by
    the Taliban, the Tribunal  directed  itself  to  past  reviews  of  the
    evidence on this point by the Upper Tribunal. In HK and Others  (minors
    - indiscriminate violence - forced recruitment  by  Taliban  -  contact
    with family members) Afghanistan CG [2010] UKUT 378 (IAC) the  Tribunal
    had concluded that whilst forced recruitment was not unheard of, it was
    not the primary source of manpower for the Taliban, who  mainly  relied
    on indoctrination and  poverty  to  entice  new  fighters.  The  recent
    decision in AS confirmed as much.   Having  directed  itself  to  these
    authorities, the Tribunal accepted that forced recruitment of  a  minor
    would be unusual, but not that it was implausible.  Ms Head asked us to
    consider the August 2018 UNHCR guidelines  that  had  been  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. These stated that in areas of high 'AGE' activity,
    these groups  use  a  "variety  of  mechanisms"  to  recruit  fighters,
    including children to be used as suicide  bombers  and  human  shields.
    This, it is submitted,  amounted  to  evidence  that  the  account  was
    positively supported by  the  country  background  evidence.  Given  Mr
    Bramble's position we need not explore  this  further  beyond  agreeing
    that the guidelines were relied upon, and they are not addressed.

13. As to ground (III) the relevant part of  the  Tribunal's  reasoning  is
    found at its �74.  It found there to be an  inconsistency  between  the
    documents at item (a) and the Appellant's own evidence about  when  his
    father ceased working for the Americans/pro-American forces.  We accept
    that the Tribunal here  appears  to  have  overlooked  the  Appellant's
    evidence in his witness statement that his father had  also  owned  his
    own shop selling spare car parts.  As  this  was  evidence  capable  of
    reconciling the identified discrepancy, it was plainly material.

14. We are satisfied, having regard to  grounds  (I)  to  (III),  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, as detailed as it is, must be  set
    aside for a failure to have regard to material evidence, and a  failure
    to make clear findings on matters in  issue.  If  the  Appellant  could
    demonstrate that he was a minor from Paktia, an area of high  insurgent
    activity whose father was regarded as a  collaborator,  that  would  go
    someway to discharging the  overall  burden  of  proof,  regardless  of
    whether the remainder of the account were to be accepted.

15. In view of our overall decision we need not  address  ground  (IV).  In
    view of the Court of Appeal's decision in AS (Afghanistan) [2019]  EWCA
    Civ 208, it will be open to the  Appellant  to  advance  any  arguments
    about the general security situation upon remaking.

16. Having had regard to the nature  of  the  errors,  and  the  extent  of
    judicial  fact  finding  required,  we  are  satisfied  that  the  most
    appropriate course of action would be for the matter to be remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.



    Decisions


    17. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for error
        of law.


    18. The decision in the appeal is to be  remade  following  a  de  novo
        hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.


    19. There is an order for anonymity.
