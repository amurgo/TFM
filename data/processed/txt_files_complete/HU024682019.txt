                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. By a "Decision and  Directions"  promulgated  on  21  January  2021,  I
    decided that Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Hussain  had  materially
    erred in law in dismissing the appellant's appeal against a decision of
    the respondent of 3 January 2019. I therefore  set  aside  the  judge's
    decision. My reasons are given  at  paras  3-9  of  the  "Decision  and
    Directions".

 2. At para 11 of the "Decision and Directions", I stated that it  appeared
    to me that it may be the respondent's position that the Upper  Tribunal
    should allow the appellant's appeal on human  rights  grounds.  I  then
    proceeded to give directions which gave the parties an  opportunity  to
    address the Upper Tribunal on para 11 of the "Decision and Directions".

 3. By a letter dated 31 January 2021, Mr  C.  Howells  of  the  Specialist
    Appeals Team confirmed, on the respondent's behalf, that the respondent
    accepted that the Upper Tribunal should allow the appellant's appeal on
    human rights grounds, Article 8.

 4. Accordingly, I re-make  the  decision  on  the  appellant's  appeal  by
    allowing the appeal on human rights grounds, Article 8.



      Decision

    The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of any error of law sufficient to require it to  be  set  aside.
    The decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hussain was set aside.
    I re-make the decision on the appellant's  appeal  by  allowing  it  on
    human rights grounds, Article 8.
