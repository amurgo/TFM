                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Vaughan, The Taylor Partnership
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Sami Nasr, is a male citizen of Morocco.  By a  decision
    promulgated 24 July 2018, I found  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    erred in law such that its decision fell to be set aside.




 2. I heard brief oral evidence at the resumed hearing at  Bradford  on  14
    September 2018.  For the Secretary of State, Mrs Pettersen acknowledged
    that there was evidence before the Tribunal which  indicated  that  the
    requirements of Regulation 9  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2016 were satisfied.  In this context, I refer to  my
    error of law decision at [3].  In  the  circumstances,  I  re-make  the
    decision allowing the appellant's appeal.

Notice of Decision

 3. The appellant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    dated 3 March 2017 is allowed.

 4. No anonymity direction is made.


Signed                              Date 10 October 2018
