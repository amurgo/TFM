                      ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, Cameroon

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C McGinley, of Gray & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwyncz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of  Cameroon,  born  on  6  June  2011.   He
    applied for clearance to enter the  UK  to  join  his  father  and  his
    father's  wife,  his  stepmother,  under  the  refugee  family  reunion
    provisions of  the  immigration  rules.   His  mother  is  said  to  be
    deceased.

 2. The ECO refused that application by a decision dated 29 May 2015, based
    mainly on the paucity of evidence provided,  and  declining  to  accept
    that the appellant's paternity was as claimed.

 3. In course of the appeal to the FtT, the sponsor obtained a DNA  report,
    which disclosed that he is not the appellant's biological father.

 4. The case advanced to the FtT was that family  life  existed  among  the
    appellant, the sponsor, and the sponsor's wife, and that  although  the
    terms of the rules could not be met, refusal to admit the appellant was
    unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, being in  breach
    of the UK's obligations under article 8 of the ECHR.

 5. FtT Judge Clapham  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by  a  decision
    promulgated  on  9  September  2016,  concluding  at   �36   that   the
    circumstances were not compelling in the absence of  any  formal  legal
    relationship.

 6. The appellant applied to the  FtT  for  permission  to  appeal  on  the
    grounds that the Judge failed to assess the article 8  appeal  "on  the
    appropriate  standard,  or  provide   adequate   reasons";   took   too
    restrictive an approach, as biological paternity was "not determinative
    of the family relationship"; there was evidence by which it should have
    been found that the appellant was a member of the family of the sponsor
    and his wife; and the appeal should have been allowed.

 7. Permission was  refused,  on  the  view  that  the  grounds  were  only
    disagreement with the findings reached.

 8. The appellant applied to the UT, on the  same  grounds,  and  adding  a
    quotation from RK [2016] UKUT 31, "It is  not  necessary  ...  to  have
    parental  responsibility  in  law  for  there  to  exist   a   parental
    relationship.  Whether a person who is not a biological parent is in  a
    parental relationship with a child for purposes  of  s.117B(6)  of  the
    2002 Act depends on the individual circumstances ... and whether ... he
    or she has stepped into the shoes of a parent".  He contended that  the
    Judge closed his mind to the possibility that a case might be made  out
    even where there is no biological connection.

 9. Permission was granted.

10. Mr McGinley submitted thus.  This is not a case  concerning  s.117B(6),
    but the same principle applies.  The sponsor and his wife gave evidence
    that they regarded the appellant as a  family  member  even  after  the
    emergence of the DNA evidence.  The Judge was entitled to observe  that
    there was a possibility of the natural father of the  appellant  taking
    an interest at some point, but that was a matter  about  which  nothing
    was known or could be found out.  The background was that  the  child's
    mother died a week after the birth; the  child  was  looked  after  for
    about a year by his maternal grandmother; she also  died,  and  he  was
    taken into the household of the sponsor and his wife; he lived with the
    sponsor for about a year until he left Cameroon, and with his wife  for
    about another year after that; since she left  Cameroon,  he  has  been
    cared for by friends of the sponsor and his wife.  He accepted that no-
    one,  as  far  as  is  known,  has  any  formal  parental   rights   or
    responsibilities towards the appellant either in Cameroon or in the UK;
    that the attitude of the authorities in Cameroon to the departure  from
    the country of an infant citizen under such circumstances  is  unknown,
    but the reverse situation would not be permitted by the  UK;  and  that
    the authorities in the UK responsible for child care might have serious
    concerns over the reception of a child coming to join parties  to  whom
    he had no biological or legal relationship.

11. We note that the proposition  that  the  sponsor's  wife  continued  to
    accept the appellant was not entirely justified  by  reference  to  the
    evidence, as it emerged that the sponsor's wife  did  not  mention  the
    matter in her statement, and in oral  examination  did  not  understand
    what the DNA report meant.

12. We reserved our decision.

13. It would be an error to approach a case on  the  view  that  there  can
    never  be  family  life  for  article  8  purposes  without  biological
    relationship or formal legal ties such as adoption or fostering.

14. Whether family life within the scope of article 8 protection exists  is
    a question of mixed fact and law, but primarily of fact.

15. This decision does not fall  into  the  error  alleged.   It  does  not
    exclude the possibility of a finding of family life.  It does treat the
    absence of adoption or any formal fostering arrangement or  legal  ties
    as material, but rightly so.  The decision correctly  observes  at  �31
    that the information  available  to  the  tribunal  is  "not  the  full
    picture" - it was very far from it - and at �33 that "arrangements  for
    the care and upbringing of the appellant must be for the authorities of
    the country of which he is a citizen."

16. It would take a very strong case, based on clear evidence,  to  require
    the UK, as recognition of a human right, to  grant  entry  to  a  small
    child  with  no  known  relatives  here  and  with  no  legal  ties  of
    responsibility to the unrelated parties who seek his entry.  The  Judge
    did not find this to be such a case.  We see no error of  law  in  that
    conclusion, based on the evidence before him.  The grounds in substance
    are only disagreement with an assessment firmly rooted in the facts.

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

18. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
