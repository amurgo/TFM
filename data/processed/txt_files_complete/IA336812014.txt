Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. G. Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S. Najma, Kher Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge K Henderson, promulgated on 28 May  2015,  in
    which she allowed Mr. Hussain's appeal against the Secretary of State's
    decision to cancel his leave to remain  and  to  remove  him  from  the
    United Kingdom.


 2. For the purposes of this appeal, I refer to the Secretary of  State  as
    the Respondent, and to Mr. Hussain as the Appellant,  reflecting  their
    positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.


 3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:


    "The cases of Gazi [2015] UKUT 000327 and Mehmood and Ali v SSHD [2015]
    EWCA Civ 744 have in part dealt with the issues of the  generic  nature
    of the evidence provided where there is a challenge by  the  respondent
    to an appellant's IELTS test.  The issue of whether or not the  generic
    evidence is sufficient is clearly arguable.  Leave is granted."


 4. The Appellant attended the hearing.  I heard oral submissions from both
    representatives following which I reserved my decision, which I set out
    below with my reasons.


Submissions


 5. Mr. Harrison relied on the grounds of appeal.


 6. Ms Najma submitted that it was a detailed 15 page decision.  The  judge
    had given careful consideration to the  evidence  before  her.   I  was
    referred to paragraph [9] where she referred to the lack  of  documents
    provided for the hearing.  It was submitted that the judge had not  had
    the necessary evidence before her to determine  whether  the  Appellant
    had taken part in a deception.  This evidence consisted  of  the  three
    generic statements presented in every TOEIC case.   In  addition  there
    was a template from the Respondent.  The judge was correct to find that
    the documents provided by the Respondent did not link the Appellant  to
    the deception.  The  burden  of  proof  was  on  the  Respondent.   The
    documents provided by the Respondent did not link the Appellant to  the
    fraud.  The judge had reached her decision after careful consideration.




 7. Mr. Harrison submitted in response that it was  a  long  decision,  but
    that the judge had rejected the  Respondent's  position  without  fully
    engaging with the accusation of fraud.  It was incumbent on  the  judge
    to make a finding as to why this evidence was rejected.


 8. Ms Najma submitted that in paragraphs [21], [23] and [28] the judge had
    given reasons for why she did not attach weight to the evidence of  the
    Respondent.  In [29] she had given clear reasons for why the Respondent
    had not discharged the burden of proof.


Error of law


 9. I find that this is a carefully considered and  well-reasoned  decision
    which does not involve the making of an error of law.


10. The judge sets out her concerns about the  documents  provided  by  the
    Respondent (paragraphs [9] to [11]).  In paragraph [10], when referring
    to the document which  was  produced  to  link  the  Appellant  to  the
    information in the two other witness statements, she stated:


    "I indicated to the Respondent's representative that simply producing a
    document like this without evidence linking it to the Appellant and  to
    the investigation was inadequate."


11. It was following this that the Respondent's representative produced  "a
    template statement which was intended to assist the First-tier Tribunal
    in understanding the process by which the Appellant was identified as a
    person  who  had  sought  to  obtain  leave  by  deception"  which  the
    Respondent's representative signed and adopted.


12. The judge set out her findings from paragraphs [20] to [34].  She  gave
    careful consideration to the statements of Rebecca Collings  and  Peter
    Millington.  (paragraphs [21] to [27]).  She then set out her  findings
    on the further statement adopted by the Respondent's representative  at
    the hearing.  At paragraph [28] she states:


    "I was finally presented  with  a  witness  statement  which  has  been
    provided by the Home Office representative.  This witness statement  is
    an attempt to link the document provided  at  the  hearing  naming  the
    Appellant with the process outlined  above.   The  difficulty  is  that
    again this witness statement is generalised."


13. The judge then set out her concerns with the term "invalid"  which  had
    been applied to the Appellant.  In paragraph [29] she states:


    "I am concerned that there is insufficient evidence  to  fully  explain
    whether the finding of "invalidity" against the  Appellant  is  on  the
    basis of a sample of his test which has been matched with a proxy  test
    taker or the alternative scenario which was outlined at paragraph 47 of
    Mr Millington's witness statement which  simply  invalidates  the  test
    result on the basis of test administration irregularity.  My conclusion
    is that it  is  important  that  where  an  individual  is  accused  of
    deception that the  full  facts  for  coming  to  that  conclusion  are
    provided on an individual  basis.   The  information  provided  by  the
    Respondent needs to confirm which  of  the  two  alternatives  outlined
    above has been applied to the Appellant.  I do not accept that  if  the
    Appellant's test score has been identified as  invalid  simply  on  the
    basis of irregularities at the test  centre  that  this  is  sufficient
    evidence to show that he has provided a fraudulent  test  result.   The
    Respondent must go further than this  to  avoid  general  and  mistaken
    assumptions regarding dishonesty.  If for  example  they  are  able  to
    provide evidence that all tests on a certain date at  a  named  college
    were obtained by abuse then this would be sufficient but  that  is  not
    the position in this appeal."


14. The judge had set out paragraph 47 of Mr Millington's witness statement
    earlier in the decision [26], and had engaged with  the  two  different
    scenarios.


15. I find that the judge carefully examined the evidence presented by  the
    Respondent.  She was aware of the seriousness of the allegation made by
    the Respondent that the Appellant had  used  deception,  and  that  the
    burden of proof rested on the Respondent.  She was aware that the  term
    "invalid" was used to cover two different scenarios, [26] and [29], and
    she was not satisfied on the evidence before her that the  use  of  the
    term "invalid" in association with the Appellant  showed  that  he  had
    used deception.  I find that the judge was entitled  to  come  to  this
    finding, having carefully analysed the evidence and having given  clear
    and cogent reasons for her finding.


16. The judge also assessed the Appellant's evidence, [30]  to  [33].   She
    did not find this evidence to be  entirely  helpful,  for  example  the
    evidence referred to in paragraph [30].  However she carefully assessed
    it and stated in paragraph [31] that "the other issues referred to  are
    not conclusive in contributing to the finding that  the  Appellant  has
    used deception".  She then gave reasons for these findings.


17. It was  for  the  Respondent  to  show  that  the  Appellant  had  used
    deception.   The  judge  gave  clear  reasons  for  finding  that   the
    Respondent had not provided sufficient evidence to  fully  explain  how
    the finding of invalidity was made in respect  of  the  Appellant,  and
    therefore that he had used  deception.   She  engaged  with  the  issue
    before her and gave clear reasons for her findings.


Notice of Decision

The decision does not involve the making of an error of law  and  I  do  not
set it aside.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
