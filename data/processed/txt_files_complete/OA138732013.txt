                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal  by  the  Appellant,  hereinafter  called  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer (ECO), against the decision of the  First-tier  Judge
    who sitting  at  Richmond  on  16  May  2014  and  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 23  May  2014  allowed  the  appeal  of  the  Respondent
    (hereinafter called the  claimant),  a  citizen  of  India  born  on  1
    September 1984, against the decision of the ECO dated 31  May  2013  to
    refuse to her an entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the spouse of
    a British citizen under paragraph EC-P.1.1(c) and (d)  of  Appendix  FM
    with  reference  to  paragraph  S-EC.2.2(a)  and   E-ECP.3.1   of   the
    Immigration Rules.

2.   The  grounds  in  support  of  the  ECO's  successful  application  for
    permission to appeal stated as follows:

         "The Rules of specified evidence are  comprehensively  set  out  in
         Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration Rules.  These set out what  types
         of evidence are required, the periods they  cover  and  the  format
         that they should be in.  The Tribunal has had no regard to this  at
         paragraph 8 of the determination where it sets out its findings  on
         this issue.  It is respectfully submitted  that  the  Tribunal  has
         failed to comply with the Immigration Rules and that  its  findings
         are therefore unsustainable.


         The Sponsor's P60 for 2012 showed an annual income of  �12,000  and
         the P60 provided for 2013 reflected an annual  income  of  �15,055.
         The earnings the Appellant relied upon  therefore  fell  below  the
         required financial threshold requirement.


         In addition the bank statements submitted did not contain  parallel
         deposits  for  the  amounts  claimed  to  have  been  paid  to  the
         Appellant's Sponsor.  Furthermore, it was noted that  the  payslips
         provided by the Appellant for her Sponsor stated that he  was  paid
         by cheque yet the deposits into his bank account did not match  the
         amount claimed to have been earned on  his  payslips.   Whilst  the
         Tribunal  appears  to  accept  that  the  Appellant's  Sponsor  was
         sometimes paid in cash this did not satisfactorily address the fact
         that his bank account did not  mirror  what  he  earned.   As  such
         having being unsure and found that it would have  been  helpful  to
         see the company accounts to see  whether  the  Sponsor  was  indeed
         receiving such sums to go on and find that he was in the absence of
         specified evidence the Tribunal erred in law.


         It follows from this that it is not clear what the Sponsor's actual
         gross annual income was  at  the  date  of  application.   It  also
         follows that the appeal can therefore not be made out.  However, it
         is also worth noting that if  the  Sponsor's  current  income  does
         exceed the income threshold, there is  no  reason  to  prevent  the
         Appellant making a fresh application based on the Sponsor's  income
         at this time."

3.   As noted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Heynes  in  granting  permission,
    the grounds of appeal in summary complained that the Judge erred in the
    consideration of the Sponsor's  salary  and  arguably  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for finding that she met the financial requirements of
    Appendix FM.

4.   Having considered the Sponsor's evidence and the  documentation  before
    her  the  First-tier  Judge  found  that  the  Sponsor's  evidence  was
    consistent with the documents and at paragraph 7 of  her  determination
    she proceeded to make the following findings:

         "7.  The Appellant claims that she meets the requirements laid down
             in the Rules.  I heard the Sponsor  give  evidence.   What  he
             told me was consistent with the documents  before  me,  and  I
             make the following findings:


             1.   The Sponsor works for a company  owned  by  his  brother,
                  Unic Construction Limited ('Unic').


             2.   Unic has only two employees, the Sponsor and his brother.


             3.   The Sponsor does not have a contract of employment.


             4.   In the tax year ending April 2012  the  Appellant  earned
                  �12,000 gross for a four month period from  December  2011
                  to March 2012.  This is  confirmed  by  his  P60  and  the
                  accountant's letter of 19 June 2013 (AB-89) as well as  an
                  HMRC filing (AB-101).


             5.   In the tax year ending April 2013  the  Appellant  earned
                  �15,055.20 gross for a seven month  period  from  June  to
                  December 2012 when he went to India.  This is confirmed by
                  his P60 and the accountant's letter of 19 June  2013  (AB-
                  89), as well as correspondence with HMRC (AB-80).


             6.   The Sponsor pays tax and national insurance.


             7.   The Sponsor's salary is sometimes paid to him  by  cheque
                  and sometimes in cash.   It  depends  how  Unic  is  paid.
                  Further some of Unic's clients pay the  Appellant  direct.
                  This means that the deposits to his account do not  mirror
                  precisely the amounts in his payslips.  The  Sponsor  does
                  not bank all the cash amounts he receives.


             8.   The Sponsor occasionally makes  purchases  with  his  own
                  money for Unic.  The Appellant told me that these sums are
                  repaid to him.


             9.   The Sponsor has no income other  than  what  he  receives
                  from Unic.  The deposits to his  bank  account  are  as  a
                  result of his work for Unic."

5.   At paragraphs 8 and 9 of  her  determination  the  Judge  concluded  as
    follows:

         "8.  Because the entries into the Sponsor's bank  account  did  not
             mirror what he earned it would have been helpful to have sight
             of  Unic's  accounts  to  see  that  the  Sponsor  was  indeed
             receiving the sums on which he was  paying  tax  and  national
             insurance and that he was being repaid for  expenditure  which
             he  was  making  on  behalf  of  Unic.   Nevertheless  as  the
             Sponsor's oral evidence was supported by the P60, payslips and
             accountant's letters before me I find that it is  more  likely
             than not that he was earning from Unic a gross  annual  income
             of over �18,600 at the date of decision.


         9.   Accordingly I find that at the date of decision the  Appellant
             and the Sponsor met the requirements of paragraph EC-P.1.1  of
             Appendix FM including E-ECP.3.1."

6.   Thus the appeal came before us on 29 July 2014 when our first task  was
    to decide whether the determination of the First-tier  Judge  disclosed
    an error or errors on a point  of  law  such  as  may  have  materially
    affected the outcome of the appeal.

7.   Mr Wilding in his submissions relied upon the grounds.  He pointed  out
    that the First-tier Judge failed to give any reason in  which  to  find
    that the �18,600 threshold  was  met  in  accordance  with  the  Rules.
    Paragraph 8 of the Judge's determination  whilst  on  the  face  of  it
    providing reasons for allowing the appeal, in  effect  demonstrated  to
    the contrary, and in  that  regard  he  referred  us  to  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules.

8.   In summary, he in particular drew our attention to  the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM-SE(2) which clearly states  that  in  respect  of  salaried
    employment in the UK "all of the following evidence must be  provided".
    There then follows a list of all of the documentation  that  should  be
    provided, and indeed he pointed out that notwithstanding the fact  that
    the Presenting Officer before the Judge had acknowledged that an  error
    had been made on the part of the Entry Clearance Officer in relation to
    the genuineness of the P60 documents, the fact was that in  any  event,
    provision 2(e) required "a signed contract of employment" and  no  such
    contract of employment was provided by the Appellant, and on that basis
    alone, the claimant  would  in  any  event  have  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.

9.   More particularly, the requirements at paragraphs (c)(i) and  (d)  were
    not met. (c) required wage slips covering a period of six months  prior
    to the date of application if the applicant had been employed by  their
    current employer for at least six months and the requirement of (d) was
    for a letter from the employer on the employer's headed paper that  the
    payslips at paragraph 2(c) met a series of requirements.

10.  The point, however, was that whilst arguably as far as  the  Judge  was
    concerned, some of those requirements were met, not all of them were so
    met. Indeed the requirements of paragraph 2(f), namely a  reference  to
    monthly personal bank statements corresponding to the same  periods  as
    the wage slips at paragraph 2(c) showing that the salary had been  paid
    into an account in the name of the person or in the name of the  person
    and their partner jointly,  was  clearly  a  requirement  that  on  the
    evidence was not met.  Mr Wilding submitted that it was apparent on the
    face of the evidence, that the  wage  slips  and  the  bank  statements
    simply did not correspond with each other.

11.  Mr Bellara for the claimant, opened his remarks  by  stressing  that  a
    particular feature of the appeal was that the basis which  appeared  to
    underpin  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  refusal,  namely  that  the
    documents  supplied  were  not  genuine,  was  in  fact  an   unfounded
    conclusion, a matter that was conceded by the Presenting Officer before
    the First-tier Judge and that in consequence she had been left  in  the
    unfortunate position and, no doubt unwelcome one, of becoming a primary
    decision-maker, and it was on that basis  that  she  therefore  had  to
    proceed to consider all the documentary evidence before her as well  as
    the oral evidence of the Sponsor in reaching her conclusion.



Assessment

12.  We have had no difficulty in concluding that the First-tier  Judge  did
    indeed materially err in law for the reasons set out in  the  Secretary
    of State's grounds and supported by the subsequent  submissions  of  Mr
    Wilding.

13.  The requirements of the  relevant  Immigration  Rules  were  absolutely
    clear and included the requirement that the applicant "must meet all of
    the requirements of Section E-ECP: Eligibility to entry clearance as  a
    partner".  Paragraph E-ECP.3.1 states that in terms  of  the  necessary
    financial requirements the applicant "must provide  specified  evidence
    from the sources listed in  E-ECP.3.2."   That  included  (a)(ii),  the
    requirement of a specified gross annual income of at least �18,600.

14.  The evidence before the First-tier Judge in the form of  the  Sponsor's
    P60s for 2012 and 2013 showed a respective annual income of �12,000 and
    �15,055.  Mr Bellara at first blush considered upon a  reading  of  the
    accountant's letters that they may  well  have  shown  that  the  gross
    income earned by the Sponsor did indeed meet the  requirements  of  the
    Rules but in fairness to him and indeed to his credit, he  subsequently
    recognised that it did not alter the  situation  in  any  material  way
    because even on the basis of the accountant's letter, they showed clear
    breaks in the periods of the Sponsor's employment.

15.  We find that it should have been self-evident to the  First-tier  Judge
    that the evidence before her demonstrated that the claimant fell  below
    the required financial thresholds.

16.  The Judge concluded that there was other  evidence  that  included  the
    accountant's letters that were before her that led her to be  satisfied
    that it was "more likely than not" that the Sponsor was earning a gross
    annual income of over �18,600 at the  date  of  decision.   With  great
    respect to the Judge, this is not a  finding  that  could  possibly  be
    supported by that evidence.  We have considered the accountant's letter
    from which it is apparent that they have failed to establish simply  by
    reference  to  specified  periods  of  four  months  and  seven  months
    respectively, that this amounted to a satisfactory  piece  of  evidence
    that the Sponsor's income over the years 2012 and 2013  equated  to  an
    income of �18,600 if calculated over a twelve month period.

17.  Prior to the hearing of the appeal before us, the Tribunal  received  a
    letter from the claimant's representatives dated 22 July 2014 to  which
    was attached a bundle of documents  that  was  referred  to  as  "fresh
    evidence that was not before the First-tier Tribunal" with the  request
    that it be considered as part of this appeal.  It was to  Mr  Bellara's
    credit, that this was not a matter that he relied upon and of course he
    was quite right not to do so, as  we  are  solely  concerned  with  the
    evidence that  was  before  the  First-tier  Judge.   If,  however,  as
    contended by the claimant, there is fresh evidence, then this should be
    the subject of an application to the ECO as  indeed  the  Secretary  of
    State on behalf of the ECO, made clear in her grounds of appeal.

Conclusion

18.  For the above reasons we find that the determination of the  First-tier
    Tribunal must be set aside.  We remake the  decision  as  follows.   We
    allow the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal.   The  appeal  against  the
    ECO's refusal to grant the claimant an entry clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom is dismissed.
