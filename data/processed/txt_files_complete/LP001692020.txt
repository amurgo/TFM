                            DECISION AND REASONS



1. Following a hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  at  Bradford  on  28
   October 2020 First-tier Tribunal Judge Lodato ('the Judge') dismissed the
   appellant's appeal on all grounds.



Background


     2. The appellant is a male citizen of Iraq described by the  Judge  as
        being in his 20s, who claimed refugee status on the basis he  would
        face persecution or serious harm as a result of his involvement  in
        resisting Hashd al-Shaabi in his home area and due to his sur place
        activities in the UK.
     3. Having considered the documentary and oral evidence the Judge  sets
        out findings of fact from [53] of the decision under challenge.
     4. The Judge expresses concerns about some aspects of the  appellant's
        evidence but at [64] writes:


        64.  For the reasons already set  out  in  the  section  above,  in
             relation to the Facebook evidence, I have  real  doubts  about
             whether the appellant truly hails from Tuz Khurmato.  However,
             as there is limited positive evidence, that does not depend on
             the appellant's account, to demonstrate his home area, I  will
             approach the issue of whether he is at risk of  indiscriminate
             violence from  the  position  that  he  would  return  to  Tuz
             Khurmato. The respondent did not challenge that the  appellant
             is a Sunni Kurd who has worked with  the  Peshmerga.  Applying
             the sliding scale analysis  provided  in  SMO,  these  factors
             would place him at risk on  return  to  this  city  given  the
             current security situation. In addition,  the  respondent  did
             not challenge that the appellant was illiterate. When  all  of
             these considerations are taken into account, I am satisfied to
             the low standard of proof that the appellant will be  at  risk
             of indiscriminate violence if returned to the  area  where  he
             claims to have originated. In view of  this  finding,  I  will
             proceed to consider whether it will be  reasonable  to  expect
             the appellant to relocate to the IKR.


     5. At [65 - 67] the Judge writes:


        65.  At paragraph 28 of the headnote of SMO, several  factors  were
             identified to assist in the  evaluation  of  whether  internal
             relocation to the IKR would be a reasonable option in a  given
             case. I  note  first  that  there  was  no  dispute  that  the
             appellant is an illiterate shepherd and that the  unemployment
             rate for displaced individuals in this region is  as  high  as
             70%. The guidance is clear that it would be essential to  have
             access  to  a  CSID  or  INID  card   to   access   employment
             opportunities and the support network of a family may also  be
             needed. As the appellant will be returning from the UK,  there
             is no basis to conclude that  he  will  be  suspected  by  the
             authorities of involvement with ISIL.  For the reasons I  have
             outlined above, I have  the  gravest  reservations  about  the
             credibility of the appellant.  His  evidence  was  tainted  by
             inconsistencies that struck at the  heart  of  his  claim  for
             asylum and I was left with no confidence that he  was  telling
             the truth about any matters of importance.  In  addition,  his
             evidence about the existence of family  members  remaining  in
             Iraq was marked by inconsistencies that I found impossible  to
             reconcile with his  providing  a  remotely  truthful  account.
             Considering these findings, I place no  weight  whatsoever  on
             the evidence given by  the  appellant  about  whether  he  has
             access to  identification  documents  or  family  members.  It
             follows that if the appellant did not wish to  return  to  his
             home area, whether that be Tuz Khurmato or elsewhere in  Iraq,
             he could reasonably relocate to the  IKR.   He  may  encounter
             some difficulties due to a  lack  of  skills  but  considering
             matters in  the  round  I  am  satisfied  that  he  would  not
             encounter difficulties amounting to a breach of Article  3  of
             the ECHR.


        66.       It is clear from the Facebook messages and posts  I  have
             seen that  the  appellant  was  openly  critical  about  Iraqi
             leaders on a public  facing  social  media  platform.  I  have
             considered the  background  information  relied  upon  by  the
             appellant but I do not find to the  applicable  standard  that
             the  appellant  would  be  reasonably  likely   to   encounter
             prosecution or serious harm  as  a  result  of  his  political
             statements.  The  background  information  relied   upon   was
             anecdotal and involved political  actors  of  a  significantly
             higher profile than the appellant. My attention was not  drawn
             to any country guidance authorities that tended to  suggest  a
             political opposition of the kind engaged in by  the  appellant
             would bring about the risk of reprisals or repression.


        67.  I have considered matters in the round and find the  appellant
             to be a witness who has not provided truthful  evidence  about
             the  key  facts  underpinning  his  claim   for   asylum   and
             humanitarian  protection.  If  he  genuinely  hails  from  Tuz
             Khurmato, I am satisfied that he would be at risk of suffering
             indiscriminate violence due  to  the  uncontroversial  matters
             constituting   his   religion,   ethnicity,    and    personal
             circumstances. However, I find that  there  would  be  nothing
             meaningful to prevent his internal relocation to the IKR.  For
             these reasons, I dismiss the appeal.


     6. The appellant sought permission  to  appeal,  which  was  initially
        refused by another judge of the First-tier Tribunal, but granted on
        a renewed application by the Upper Tribunal on ground 4 only, which
        is pleaded in the following terms:


        Ground 4  -  inadequate  consideration  of  arguments  relating  to
        internal relocation


        18.  The IJ has approach the question of internal  relocation  from
             an Article 3 ECHR  perspective  and  has  failed  to  consider
             whether  internal  relocation  will   be   unduly   harsh   or
             unreasonable. That is legally erroneous:


         "He may encounter some difficulties due to a lack of  skills,  but
             considering matters in the round, I am satisfied that he would
             not encounter difficulties amounting to a breach of Article  3
             of the ECHR." (paragraph 65)


        19.  Furthermore, in  respect  of  the  IKR,  there  isn't  a  full
             analysis by the IJ at paragraph 65 of the Determination of the
             factors  set  down  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  SMO  at  the
             paragraphs 21 to 28 of the headnote.  The  IJ  has  failed  to
             consider in this context his finding  that  the  Appellant  is
             illiterate, worked only as a shepherd, has no  family  in  the
             IKR nor has he ever lived in the IKR which is  fundamental  to
             the  analysis  of  whether  he  will   be   able   to   secure
             accommodation (see paragraph 27 Headnote, SMO) and  employment
             (see paragraph 28 Headnote, SMO ). The issues  highlighted  at
             Ground 5. below are also relevant to the safety of  relocation
             to the IKR but have not, for the reasons set out in Ground  5,
             being adequately considered by the IJ.


     7. Paragraphs [27 - 28] of the headnote of the country  guidance  case
        of SMO, which accurately reflect the findings  made  by  the  Upper
        Tribunal in that decision, read:


     1.  For  Kurds  without  the  assistance  of  family  in  the  IKR  the
        accommodation options are limited:

        i) Absent special circumstances it is not reasonably likely that  P
           will be able to gain access to one of the refugee camps  in  the
           IKR; these camps  are  already  extremely  overcrowded  and  are
           closed to newcomers. 64% of IDPs  are  accommodated  in  private
           settings with the vast majority living with family members;


       ii) If P cannot live with a family member, apartments  in  a  modern
           block in a new neighbourhood are available for rent at a cost of
           between $300 and $400 per month;


      iii) P could resort to a 'critical shelter arrangement', living in an
           unfinished or  abandoned  structure,  makeshift  shelter,  tent,
           mosque, church or squatting in a government building.  It  would
           be unduly harsh to require P to relocate to the IKR  if  P  will
           live in a critical  housing  shelter  without  access  to  basic
           necessities such as food, clean water and clothing;

       iv)  In  considering  whether  P  would  be  able  to  access  basic
           necessities, account must be  taken  of  the  fact  that  failed
           asylum seekers are entitled to  apply  for  a  grant  under  the
           Voluntary Returns Scheme, which could give P  access  to  �1500.
           Consideration should also be  given  to  whether  P  can  obtain
           financial support from other sources such as (a) employment, (b)
           remittances from relatives abroad, (c) the  availability  of  ad
           hoc charity or by being able to access PDS rations.

     2. Whether P is able to secure employment must be assessed on a case-by-
        case basis taking the following matters into account:


        i) Gender. Lone women are  very  unlikely  to  be  able  to  secure
           legitimate employment;


       ii) The unemployment rate for Iraqi IDPs living in the IKR is 70%;


      iii) P cannot work without a CSID or INID;

       iv) Patronage and nepotism  continue  to  be  important  factors  in
           securing employment. A returnee with family connections  to  the
           region will have  a  significant  advantage  in  that  he  would
           ordinarily  be  able  to  call  upon  those  contacts  to   make
           introductions to prospective employers and to vouch for him;

        v) Skills, education and experience. Unskilled workers are  at  the
           greatest disadvantage, with  the  decline  in  the  construction
           industry reducing the number of labouring jobs available;

       vi) If P is from an area with a marked association with  ISIL,  that
           may deter prospective employers.


Error of law


     8. Mr Hussain in  his  opening  address  stated  that  the  Judge  was
        required to apply the correct test as per SMO but had failed to  do
        so.
     9. On behalf of the Secretary of State Mr Bates argued that the  Judge
        had applied the test of reasonableness, referring  specifically  to
        [65] of the decision under challenge where the Judge refers to  the
        headnote of SMO and considers whether internal  relocation  was  an
        option in this appeal. Specific reference is made to the finding in
        [65] that if the appellant could not return to his  home  area  "he
        could reasonably relocate to the IKR" a finding, in part based upon
        the unchallenged findings of  the  Judge  that  the  appellant  has
        family in Iraq and a CSID.
    10. The Judge at [67] also finds  there  was  nothing  'meaningful'  to
        prevent the appellant's internal relocation to the IKR which can be
        reasonably inferred as the Judge's assessment of the reasonableness
        of internal relocation.
    11. It is important to consider the decision as a  whole.  It  was  not
        made out before the Judge that the  appellant  is  an  undocumented
        asylum seeker unable to return to Baghdad. It was not made  out  he
        will be unable to travel within Iraq, especially  in  circumstances
        in which his claim to have no relatives in Iraq was found  to  lack
        credibility.
    12. It was not made out the appellant does not have a male relative  in
        Iraq able to meet him at the airport to assist in  travel  back  to
        his home area or, in accordance with Kurdish custom and  tradition,
        to provide him with the  necessary  accommodation  and  support  to
        enable him to re-establish himself elsewhere.
    13. The  Judge  expresses  grave  reservations  about  the  appellant's
        claimed home area but proceeded to consider the  reasonableness  of
        internal relocation.  No legal error  is  made  out  in  the  clear
        finding made by the Judge that it was not unreasonable in  all  the
        circumstances for the appellant to relocate with the assistance  of
        family members. The submission of the  appellant's  behalf  in  the
        grounds seems to ignore this important factor.
    14. The appellant did not establish before  the  Judge,  in  accordance
        with SMO, that he is an undocumented Iraqi. It was not made out the
        appellant would have to seek accommodation in one of the IDP  camps
        as he has family members in Iraq and had not established before the
        Judge that they will be unable or unwilling to provide him with the
        required degree of support.
    15. The Judge makes clear findings supported by adequate  reasons  that
        the appellant had not discharged the burden of proof  upon  him  to
        show he was entitled to a  grant  of  international  protection  or
        leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  on  any  basis,  a  finding
        clearly open to the Judge in the light of the lack  of  credibility
        in the appellant's claim. The pleadings do not establish this is  a
        finding outside the range of those reasonably available to you  the
        Judge on the evidence sufficient  to  warrant  the  Upper  Tribunal
        interfering any further in this matter.
Decision

    16. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

Anonymity.


    17. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


I make such order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure     (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.
