Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondents:   Mr R Singer, instructed by Lawland Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Heatherington)  allowing  the  respondents'
    appeals (hereafter the "claimants") against decisions of the  Secretary
    of State refusing their human rights claims under Art 8 of the ECHR.



Introduction

 2. Both  claimants  are  citizens  of  Sri  Lanka  and  are  of  Sinhalese
    ethnicity.  The first claimant was born on 6 January 1990 and is of the
    Buddhist faith.  The second claimant was born on 23 November  1989  and
    is of the Christian faith.  Both claimants are gay and they married  in
    the UK on 25 July 2015.

 3. They each claimed asylum on the basis that they would be subject  to  a
    real risk of persecution by reason of their sexual orientation if  they
    were returned to Sri Lanka.  Their respective claims  were  refused  by
    the Secretary of State on 24 June 2015 and 15 July 2015.

 4. Both claimants appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

The Appeal

 5. Judge Heatherington dismissed each  of  their  appeals  on  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection grounds.  Whilst he accepted that each claimant
    was  credible  and  that  they  were  in  a  same-sex  marriage,  Judge
    Heatherington did not accept that the background  evidence  established
    that in Sri Lanka they would be subject to persecution  on  account  of
    their sexual orientation.

 6. Nevertheless, Judge Heatherington went on  to  consider  their  appeals
    under Art 8 and in particular para  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules (HC 395 as amended).  He found on the evidence that each  of  the
    claimants had established that there were "very significant  obstacles"
    to their integration into Sri Lanka and as a consequence they  met  the
    requirement in para 276ADE(1)(vi) and he allowed the appeal under Art 8
    accordingly.

 7. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal against the  judge's
    decision to allow the appeal under Art 8 relying on para 276ADE(1)(vi).
     On 4 July 2016, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Lambert)  granted  the
    Secretary  of  State  on  the  ground   that   there   was:   "arguable
    inconsistency between  the  dismissal  of  the  asylum  claim  and  the
    allowing of the appeals under the significant obstacles  test  in  para
    276ADE."

 8. Shortly before the hearing, the claimants  filed  a  rule  24  response
    seeking to uphold the judge's decision under para 276ADE and Art  8  on
    the basis that the judge had given adequate reasons for his finding and
    that finding was not perverse or irrational.

 9. No cross-appeal has been brought by the claimants against  the  judge's
    decision that the background evidence did not establish a real risk  of
    persecution or serious ill-treatment on their return to Sri Lanka.   It
    is accepted that the claimants are a gay couple who have entered into a
    marriage in the UK.

Discussion

10. So far as relevant, para 276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules provides as
    follows:

         "The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on
         the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the date of
         application the applicant:

         ....

         (vi) ... is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in the
            UK for less than 20 years (discounting any period of
            imprisonment) but there would be very significant obstacles to
            the applicant's integration into the country to which he would
            have to go if required to leave the UK."

11. It was not suggested before me that if the claimants were  entitled  to
    succeed under para 276ADE(1)(vi) then they should not succeed under Art
    8 of the ECHR.

12. The judge's reasoning in respect of para 276ADE(1) is found principally
    at paras 36-40 of his determination as follows:

         "36. I then  went  on  to  consider  rule  276ADE  (1)(vi)  of  the
             immigration rules. To establish whether  the  appellants  meet
             this rule, first the appellants must have  lived  continuously
             in the UK for less than 20 years. They have.  Secondly, it  is
             necessary to establish that there would  be  very  significant
             obstacles to their integration into Sri Lanka, if required  to
             leave the UK.

         37.  I am satisfied that the appellants' relationship and  marriage
             are genuine and subsisting and they intend  to  live  together
             permanently as same sex partners.

         38.  I find that the appellants should not be  required  to  behave
             discreetly and pretend to be heterosexual on the authority  of
             HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31.

         39.  Returning to Sri Lanka will, it is  suggested,  be  disastrous
             for the appellants and their relationship. The evidence is  of
             the rejection by parents, family  members,  relatives  of  the
             appellants and outrage in the community. And of  threats  from
             the family of Dilini Rajapakshe. I accept this evidence.

         40.  For all  these  reasons  I  find  that  there  would  be  very
             significant obstacles to the appellants' integration into  Sri
             Lanka, if required to leave the UK."

13. Mr Richards, on behalf of the Secretary of  State  submitted  that  the
    judge's finding in respect of para 276ADE  was  wholly  inadequate  and
    incompatible with the judge's finding that they would not  be  at  real
    risk of persecution or serious ill-treatment on return to Sri Lanka  by
    reason of their sexual orientation.  He submitted  that  the  claimants
    were no worse off in Sri  Lanka  if  their  family  and  relatives  had
    rejected them since they were  separated  from  them  in  the  UK.   He
    submitted, in effect, that the judge's finding was perverse.

14. The proper approach to para 276ADE(1)(vi) was considered by  the  Court
    of Appeal in SSHD v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813.  There, the  court  was
    concerned with the same test, found in the context of  deportation,  in
    para 399A of the Rules and s.117C(4) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.  At [14], Sales LJ (with whose judgment Moore-Bick
    LJ agreed) said this:

         "14. In my view, the concept of a foreign criminal's  "integration"
             into the country to which it is proposed that he be  deported,
             as set out in section 117C(4)(c)  and  paragraph  399A,  is  a
             broad one. It is not confined to the mere ability  to  find  a
             job or to sustain life while living in the other  country.  It
             is not appropriate to treat the statutory language as  subject
             to some gloss and it will usually be sufficient for a court or
             tribunal simply to direct itself in the terms that  Parliament
             has chosen to use. The idea of "integration" calls for a broad
             evaluative judgment to be made as to  whether  the  individual
             will be enough of an insider in  terms  of  understanding  how
             life in the society in that other country is carried on and  a
             capacity to participate in it, so  as  to  have  a  reasonable
             opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to operate  on  a
             day-to-day basis in that society and  to  build  up  within  a
             reasonable time a  variety  of  human  relationships  to  give
             substance to the individual's private or family life."

15. The approach of the Court of Appeal to the  identical  wording  in  the
    context of deportation decision applies, in  my  judgment,  with  equal
    effect in non-deportation cases.

16. The concept of "integration" is a "broad one" requiring an  "evaluative
    judgment" to be made  of  the  individual's  capacity  and  ability  to
    function in the society to which they  will  return  and  whether  they
    would have a reasonable opportunity to function as  a  member  of  that
    society and to build up  in  a  reasonable  time  a  variety  of  human
    relationships.

17. Of course, what must be shown to stand in the way of such "integration"
    is "very  significant  obstacles"  which,  no  doubt,  imposes  a  high
    threshold.  In its very recent decision in Treebhawon and Others  (NIAA
    2002 Part 5A - compelling circumstances test) [2017] UKUT 13 (IAC), the
    Upper Tribunal stated (at [37]):

         "The other limb of the test, " very significant obstacles",  erects
         a self-evidently elevated threshold, such that mere hardship,  mere
         difficulty, mere hurdles and mere upheaval or  inconvenience,  even
         where multiplied, will generally be insufficient in  this  context.
         The philosophy and reasoning, with appropriate adjustments, of this
         Tribunal in its exposition of the sister test "unduly harsh" in  MK
         (Sierra Leone) [2015] UKUT 223 at [46] apply."

18.  Judge  Heatherington  undoubtedly  correctly   directed   himself   in
    accordance with the language of para 276ADE(1)(vi).  In paras 36-40, he
    recognised a number of factors, largely derived from the impact in  Sri
    Lanka  of  the  claimants'  sexual  orientation.   His   reasoning   is
    relatively brief.  However, his determination must fairly be read as  a
    whole.  He accepted the  evidence  of  both  claimants  both  in  their
    witness statements and oral evidence.  Both claimants  spoke  in  their
    witness statements of the "disastrous" effect on their relationship  of
    return to Sri Lanka (para 41 of the  first  claimant's  statement)  and
    that their  relationship  will  be  broken  and  their  lives  will  be
    "devastated" (para 12 of  the  second  claimant's  witness  statement).
    Their evidence, which  was  accepted  by  the  judge,  was  that  their
    families had disowned them and that both  feared  the  parents  of  the
    first claimant and the family of a girl  whom  they  wished  the  first
    claimant to marry.  Further, there  was  evidence  of  threats  by  the
    second claimant's parents.  Although the  judge  did  not  accept  that
    these threats gave rise to a claim to asylum or  under  Art  3  of  the
    ECHR, he did not reject the evidence and, no doubt, it formed  in  part
    the basis for his finding in  para  39  that  the  claimants  had  been
    rejected by their parents and families.

19. There was also evidence from the first claimant that gay people in  Sri
    Lanka did not express their preferences  openly.   Whilst,  again,  the
    judge did not consider that this created a real risk of persecution, he
    nevertheless noted at para 38 that the claimants could not on return be
    required to behave "discreetly and pretend to be heterosexual".

20. There was, in my judgment, nothing inconsistent in the judge's  adverse
    finding in relation to risk  on  return  and  his  finding  under  para
    276ADE(1)(vi).  At para 26 of his  determination,  Judge  Heatherington
    set out a section  from  the  Home  Office  Country  Guidance  document
    entitled "Sri Lanka: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity" (September
    2015) which was in the following terms:

         "2.5 Are those at risk able to seek effective protection?

             2.5.1     There   are   no   legal   safeguards   to   prevent
                  discrimination  based  on  sexual  orientation  or  gender
                  identity. Incidents of homophobia  go  unreported  due  to
                  individuals wanting to protect  their  identities.  Police
                  often misinterpret the laws on the  basis  of  a  person's
                  appearance or behaviour and there  have  been  reports  of
                  police assaulting, harassing and extorting money or sexual
                  favours from LGBTI individuals with impunity, particularly
                  in Colombo as well as other areas (See Attitudes of  state
                  officials, Societal attitudes and State protection).

             2.5.2     The  lack  of  anti-discrimination  legislation   to
                  protect the rights of LGBTI  individuals  has  meant  that
                  they have no recourse to a remedy when particular laws are
                  used against LGBTI persons  in  a  discriminatory  manner.
                  Such discrimination is further enabled and promoted by the
                  continued criminalisation, and  therefore  stigmatisation,
                  of LGBTI persons. LGBTI individuals who are the victims of
                  violence or hate crimes cannot report these crimes to  the
                  police without  fear  that  their  sexual  orientation  or
                  gender identity will be exposed or highlighted, leading to
                  further   discrimination    and    marginalization    and,
                  potentially, in theory, to prosecution under articles  365
                  and 365A of the Constitution. LBGTI people who  experience
                  physical violence rarely  seek  compensation,  redress  or
                  counselling from service providers who work with women who
                  have experienced violence (See State protection).

             2.5.3    There is a general perception in he  LGBTI  community
                  that police officers used blackmail and  violence  against
                  persons they perceived  to  be  homosexual,  bisexual,  or
                  transgender.  If  the  person's   fear   is   of   serious
                  harm/persecution  at  the  hands  of  the  state,  it   is
                  unreasonable to consider  they  would  be  able  to  avail
                  themselves of the protection of the authorities.

             2.5.4    If the person's fear is of  serious  harm/persecution
                  at the hands of non-state agents  or  rogue  state  agents
                  then  effective  state  protection  is  unlikely   to   be
                  available. The evidence is that the state is unwilling  to
                  provide   protection   to   those   subject   to   serious
                  harm/persecution on grounds that they are LGBTI.  Decision
                  makers need to consider each case on its facts.  The  onus
                  is on the person to demonstrate why they would not be able
                  to seek and obtain state protection."

21. As I have already indicated, there  is  no  challenge  to  the  judge's
    adverse finding that the claimants had not established a real  risk  of
    persecution  but,  this  background  evidence  did  demonstrate   anti-
    discriminatory action against the LGBTI community  in  Sri  Lanka,  not
    least from the Sri Lankan authorities, such as the police  force.   The
    judge was entitled to take this background evidence into  consideration
    in making the "evaluative judgment" required by para 276ADE(1)(vi) even
    though it did not  establish  the  claimants'  asylum  or  humanitarian
    protection claims.

22. I do not accept Mr Richards' submission that the fact that the claimant
    would be estranged or isolated from their parents and relatives in  Sri
    Lanka is no worse than their position in the UK.  That  fails  to  take
    into account the societal context in Sri Lanka.  In the  UK,  there  is
    nothing  in  the  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  claimants'   sexual
    orientation has, or will, result in  any  discriminatory  behaviour  or
    difficulty in them integrating in the UK.  Indeed, the evidence is  all
    the other way and they have  entered  into  a  same-sex  marriage.   By
    contrast,  in  Sri  Lanka,  the  societal  context  will  be   one   of
    discrimination  and  hostility  to  their  sexual  orientation.   Their
    estrangement from their parents or relatives in Sri Lanka  will,  as  a
    consequence,  potentially  have  a  far  greater   impact   upon   them
    participating in society so as to have a reasonable opportunity  to  be
    accepted and to be able to operate  on  a  day-to-day  basis  and  form
    relationships in Sri Lanka.

23. There would, in my judgment, be "obstacles" to their "integration" into
    Sri Lanka in the sense that term is understood by the Court  of  Appeal
    in Kamara.  The Judge was entitled  to  find,  in  effect,  that  these
    obstacles were, in the language of Treebhawon, not "mere hardship, mere
    difficulty, mere hurdles and mere upheaval or inconvenience".

24. In my judgment, the  judge  gives  adequate  reasons  for  his  finding
    reading his judgment as a whole.  The judge's decision makes sense  and
    the Secretary of State can readily understand why the appeal  succeeded
    under para 276ADE and, as a consequence,  although  brief  the  reasons
    are, in my judgment, adequate (see Shizad (sufficiency of reasons:  set
    aside) [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC)).

25. Further, reading the judge's  determination  as  a  whole,  he  made  a
    correct self-direction in relation to the law and his finding  was,  in
    my judgment, clearly within the range of legitimate evaluative judgment
    which the judge had to make on the facts.  The mere fact that not every
    judge would necessarily have reached the same finding  and  that  Judge
    Heatherington's finding may appear to be a "generous view of the facts"
    does not mean that the finding was irrational or perverse (see Mukarkar
    v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1045 at [40] per Carnwath LJ).





Decision

26. For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the judge  was  entitled  to
    reach  his  finding  that  the  claimants  had  established  that  para
    276ADE(1)(vi) applied.  The Judge did not err in law  in  allowing  the
    claimants' appeals under Art 8.

27. Accordingly, the Secretary of  State's  appeal  is  dismissed  and  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
