Representation
For the Appellant:     Sponsor present
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 1  January  1964.  His
    appeal against the decision of the respondent dated 27 December 2012 to
    refuse his application for an entry clearance as a family  visitor  was
    dismissed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in   a   determination
    promulgated on 31 July 2014. The FTT Judge was not satisfied  that  the
    appellant was a genuine visitor for the period stated.

 2. On 4 September 2014, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Osborne  granted  the
    appellant permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.  It  was  an
    arguable error  that  the  Judge  had  missed  the  appellant's  wife's
    statement which was in the bundle. The Judge had  however  stated  that
    there was no written statement from her.  There  was  however  a  brief
    statement from her in  the  bundle  which  was  available  for  him  to
    consider.

 3. Before the Upper tribunal on 27 October 2014, the  respondent  accepted
    that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had  materially  erred  [12]  when
    stating that there was no evidence before him as to the state of health
    of the appellant's mother.  That,  together  with  the  other  arguable
    grounds meant  that  the  ultimate  finding  at  paragraph  13  of  the
    determination was affected.

 4. The Upper Tribunal found that although it was clear that the Judge  had
    given  a  very  detailed  and  otherwise   careful   determination,   a
    significant part of his assessment included the finding that there  was
    no written statement from the sponsor's mother. In addition, there  was
    evidence,  albeit  brief,  regarding  the  state  of  health   of   the
    appellant's mother. There was also a report from a  local  doctor  that
    the appellant's mother, whom the doctor had treated for  a  long  time,
    was paralysed. He also referred to his treatment of her "as a  case  of
    HTN DM II."

 5. The  Judge  had  accordingly  not  taken  into  account  a  potentially
    significant corroboratory statement from the medical practitioner which
    affected his ultimate finding that  the  appellant  did  not  have  the
    necessary intention to leave the UK at the end of his visit.

 6. The parties accordingly agreed that the decision should  be  set  aside
    and re-made. The appellant's sponsor requested that  he  be  given  the
    opportunity to produce further evidence. Mr Walker, who represented the
    entry clearance officer on the 27 October 2014 had no objection in that
    regard. Directions  were  given  and  the  rehearing   was  accordingly
    adjourned to 22 December 2014.

    Hearing on 22 December 2014

 7. Updated statements from the appellant's wife and his son (the sponsor),
    were produced.  There was also further documentation.

 8. The appellant's sponsor, Mr Muhammad Farooq Yousuf of  34  Rowan  Road,
    London, attended the hearing and gave evidence. He adopted his  witness
    statement dated 2 December 2014.

 9. He lives at  the  address  given  together  with  his  mother  and  two
    brothers. He came to the UK with his mother on 9 August 2001. He  is  a
    student at  Kingston  University,  in  his  second  year.  He  is  also
    employed, earning about �350 a month.

10. He has visited Pakistan twice with his mother and  brother.  The  first
    occasion was in 2007 and the second in 2009 for 20 days. He  stayed  at
    his father's house on  that  occasion.  He  and  his  brothers  enjoyed
    spending time with the appellant.

11. On the first occasion they went to Pakistan,  Mrs  Benazir  Bhutto  was
    killed. There were riots. The situation was  the  same  on  the  second
    occasion that they went.

12. He confirms that the appellant is looking after his mother, who is  ill
    and has suffered a stroke in the  past.  He  is  fully  responsible  in
    Pakistan for her day to day needs.

13. Mr Melvin cross-examined Mr. Yousuf. His father wishes to visit the  UK
    to see the family and they wish to see him as well. They want  to  show
    him the country. He has not visited here before.  He  has  visited  his
    father a couple of times.

14. His father is about 58  years old. He  works  in  Pakistan.  He  has  a
    'timber business'. He explained that he is  in  fact  a  carpenter.  He
    intends visiting for about two months.  During  that  period,  he  will
    sight see.

15. He was asked why his father would return to Pakistan. He has a business
    there. He is also looking after his  mother,  who  is  ill.  He  has  a
    younger brother who will manage the business while  he  is  away.   The
    business cannot be run from the UK. It is  not  an  'online  business'.
    Somebody has to be there in order to run it.

16. The appellant is still married to the sponsor's mother. The latter  has
    lived here for 13 years.  She  has  been  back  to  Pakistan  on  three
    occasions.

17. His mother was granted  asylum  on  the  basis  of  the  treatment  she
    received at the hands of the appellant. Mr  Melvin  asked  whether  the
    asylum claim was  fictitious  or  whether  they  have  in  fact  become
    reconciled after that. He said that she had made a genuine claim.  They
    have reconciled "to an extent". He does  not  know  how  long  it  took
    before they became reconciled.

18. Whilst he is here, the appellant intends to hire someone to look  after
    his mother.  His  brother  has  his  own  family  to  look  after.  The
    appellant has sisters in Pakistan. They have their families  there  and
    live quite far  from  the  appellant's  mother.  One  is  suffering  an
    illness. There is no family member who can look after his mother for  a
    lengthy period. His father has looked after her for over five years.

19. Mr Yousuf said that he  came to the UK as his  mother's  dependant.  He
    was about six at the time. His mother works in  the  UK.  She  has  two
    sisters who help her out. She has a full time job as a carer. He is not
    aware of any benefits that she is receiving. She has her  own  property
    which is mortgaged.

20. The appellant will live with him and his mother whilst he is  here.  He
    could also stay in a hotel if he wished. He does not know.  His  mother
    will provide his father with accommodation if he needs it.

21. Mr Melvin referred to the respondent's bundle containing a letter  from
    Ms Farida Yousuf in which she confirms that she gives permission to the
    appellant to live at her house during his visit to the  UK.  Mr  Yousuf
    said  that  the  grounds  of  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    contained a detailed statement from his father setting out his case  in
    full.

22. He was asked what he would do if the appellant decided that  he  wished
    to stay in the UK after his visa expired. He  would  'convince  him  to
    return'. He would be prepared to give an undertaking to report  him  to
    the police as well as the immigration authorities should he  ultimately
    refuse to return voluntarily.

23. Ms Farida Yousuf attended the hearing and gave evidence. She resides at
    37 Rowan Road, London.  She  adopted  her  witness  statement  dated  2
    December 2014.

24. She arrived in the UK on 9 August 2001. She  has  continued  to  remain
    here. She is a carer, earning �1000 a month.  She  owns  the  property,
    having purchased it in 2010. She has three sons from the  marriage  and
    they are her dependants and permanently settled here. They have British
    nationality. She sought asylum on account of domestic violence  at  the
    hands of her husband.

25. She has travelled to Pakistan in 2007, 2009 and finally in 2012. On the
    first two occasions she took her children with  her  and  on  the  last
    occasion she went alone. She assisted  her  husband  in  preparing  his
    application. He wished to come to the UK to visit his children whom  he
    has not seen since 2009.

26. She stated that the reaction of her children to the death of Ms  Bhutto
    as well as the riots in Karachi was that it  was  unsafe  for  them  to
    visit Pakistan.

27. The appellant is remorseful of his actions. He  has  become  respectful
    for the sake of the children. They enjoyed  their  stay  with  him  and
    became close. The appellant is able to finance his return ticket.

28. Her mother in law suffered a stroke and is paralysed.  Her  husband  is
    the main carer of his mother and "due to this" he will return  after  a
    short visit here.

29. She 'gives an undertaking' that her husband only intends to visit  here
    for a short period. He has a business in Pakistan. He has  a  home  and
    has relatives, including his mother and other extended family members.

30. He is responsible for the day to day care of his mother, including  her
    expenses and well being.

31. In cross-examination, she confirmed that she is still  married  to  the
    appellant. He lives with his mother. He wants to come to  the  UK.  His
    behaviour towards her was bad. He has now  totally  changed  since  she
    went back to Pakistan. He wants to  come  to  the  UK  because  of  the
    children. He wants to see them. She is scared to send the  children  to
    Pakistan.

32. When asked whether her husband would wish to settle here because of the
    problems there, she said that he is committed to look after his mother.
    He also works there.  He  has  no  "intimate"  relationship  with  her.
    Although they are not divorced, they do not live  together  as  husband
    and wife. When she came to the UK the child was only one month old.  He
    had not really met his father. He asks about his father.

33. The appellant occasionally sends gifts  and  clothes  via  visitors  to
    Pakistan. He does not make regular payments, but only when other family
    members are able to bring money here.

34. She supports her three children. She works. She receives Child  Benefit
    and Working Tax Credit. She does not have Housing Benefit. She pays the
    mortgage herself.

35. She was asked why her husband wished to see his children if he  is  not
    supporting them. She said  he  does  send  money,  however  it  is  the
    children who miss him.

36. The appellant has a brother and three sisters  currently  in  Pakistan.
    They live in the Karachi area. He is a "wealthy man" by  the  standards
    there. He will only come here for a month or  maybe  three  weeks.   He
    will stay with them. They will have a  good  time.  She  will  continue
    working while he is here.  He does not intend to apply  for  employment
    here. He will not be able to work. Nor does he have  any  intention  to
    work.  Whilst he is away, he has employees to  continue  the  business.
    His brother will also help. His brother works there but not too much as
    he is not too well.

37. During his visit to the UK, a "lady has been engaged" to look after his
    mother. He has looked after his mother all the time. The other brothers
    do not. It has only been the appellant who was looking after her.

38. The appellant has no other relatives here, nor does  he  have  friends.
    She does not want her sons' record to be ruined.  She  would  "let  the
    immigration people or the police" know if he did not want to return.

    Submissions

39. Mr Melvin relied on the reasons for refusal. The fear that the children
    would have problems in Pakistan is not  a  sufficient  reason  for  the
    appellant's trip. The children have visited him in Pakistan before.

40. The appellant is not supporting them to any  degree.  There  was  vague
    evidence of support. Also,  when  regard  is  had  to  the  appellant's
    employment, there do not appear to be sufficient ties in Pakistan.  Nor
    does his mother's problem make it "imperative" that he will return.

41. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Yosouf said  that  there  are  documents
    showing his grandmother's illness. There are also documents relating to
    the ownership of his father's  business.  There  are  "enough  reasons"
    showing that he will return. He could not support himself here  in  any
    event. He does not speak English.

    Assessment

42. I found the evidence of the sponsor and his mother  to  be  essentially
    credible. I have also had regard to the  documentation,  including  the
    financial documentation, provided by the sponsor and his mother.

43. There is a report produced from Proessor Wala, a  consultant  physician
    in Karachi, dated 26 November 2014. He has set out the medical problems
    relating to the appellant's mother. She has been under  his  treatment.
    This is "a case of high blood pressure, diabetic 2 and paralysis  since
    long time." He has set out the medication that she consumes.

44. I have also had regard to the entry clearance manager's review.  It  is
    asserted that the appellant has relied  primarily  on  self  supporting
    affidavits from colleagues to demonstrate his circumstances. They carry
    little evidential value. Nor does  Article  8  confer  a  right  to  be
    admitted for a visit. They can visit each other outside the country.

45. The reasons for refusal  challenge  the  appellant's  business.  It  is
    accepted that he owns property. However, he does not derive  an  income
    from it. The officer was not satisfied that the amounts of  money  held
    in his account are under his exclusive control. Nor  had  he  travelled
    outside Pakistan before and has thus not demonstrated  compliance  with
    any restrictions imposed on his stay in another country,  which  "might
    offset my other concerns."

46. There was however no  reference  to  the  lengthy  grounds  of  appeal,
    including evidence relating to rental income and letters confirming his
    "running of the timber  market  with  them."  There  is  also  evidence
    produced relating to his mother, relatives and siblings in Pakistan, as
    well as his investments there.

47. Having regard to the evidence as a whole, including the evidence of Mrs
    Yousuf, I have no reason to suppose that the appellant's intentions are
    anything other than that which he has given. He  wishes  to  visit  his
    children in the UK for a short period. He has strong ties to  Pakistan.
    He has his business there and has been primarily responsible  for  this
    mother in Pakistan and will continue to provide her with daily care.

48. I am also satisfied that both his son and Mrs Yousuf will  take  proper
    steps, including reporting him to the authorities, in the event that he
    seeks  to  overstay.  Both  are  aware  of  the  significance  of   the
    undertakings they have given to the Tribunal in that respect.

49. Having regard to the evidence as a whole, I find that the  decision  of
    the respondent was not in accordance with the law and  the  immigration
    rules applicable.

    Notice of Decision

    The appeal is allowed under the immigration rules
