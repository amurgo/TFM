Representation:
For the claimant: Mr J Butterworth, instructed by Bespoke Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby Weller, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, AS, with claimed date of birth 1.1.83,  claims  to  be  a
    citizen  of  Burma/Myanmar.   The  Secretary  of  State  disputes   his
    nationality and believes him to be Bangladeshi.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Hembrough promulgated 27.10.15,  allowing  on
    asylum grounds the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 7.1.15, to refuse  his  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    20.10.15.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lever  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    30.11.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 2.2.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below, I find that there was such error of  law
    in the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    decision of Judge Hembrough should be set aside for the decision to  be
    remade.

 6. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    claimant asserts that he is a Rohingya Muslim from  Latapandom  in  the
    Mongdau District of Aragon State in Burma. Following the death  of  his
    parents in 1992 at the hands of the Burmese military his uncle took  he
    and other family members across the border into Bangladesh, where  they
    resided in the Dechua Palong refugee camp. The claimant's case is  that
    he left the camp in 1998 and travelled via Chittagong to Sylhet,  where
    he found employment as a domestic worker for 5 years. On  his  employer
    discovering that he is Rohingya, he was sent with an agent to  the  UK,
    arriving in December 2005, and where he was required  to  pay  off  the
    cost of his journey by working  in  an  Asian  restaurant.  He  claimed
    asylum on 6.9.13.

 7. Finding his claim not credible, The Secretary of State did  not  accept
    that the  claimant  was  either  Burmese  or  a  Rohingya  Muslim,  but
    considers him to be Bangladeshi who would not be at risk on  return  to
    Bangladesh.

 8. A crucial issue raised in the refusal decision and  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appeal hearing was what is purported to be an original  ration
    book issued to the  claimant's  uncle  GK  at  the  refugee  camp.  The
    Secretary of State pointed out at �39  of  the  refusal  decision  that
    although the claimant asserts that he brought this book with  him  when
    he left the camp in 1998, the medical section for MS (alleged to be the
    claimant) appears to show an entry from 1999, which reduced the  weight
    able to be placed on this document.  It  was  further  noted  that  the
    relationships  set  out  in  the  ration  book  differ  to  the  family
    relationships asserted by the claimant. Reliance  was  also  placed  on
    external information that old family ration books have  been  purchased
    from  refugees  or  family  members   of   repatriated   refugees   and
    subsequently used to claim false identities, or names added,  in  order
    to claim refugee status abroad.

 9. Other concerns were raised in the refusal decision as to  the  language
    spoken by the claimant, who was interviewed in  a  Sylheti  dialect  of
    Bengali and not Burmese  or  Rohingya,  and  his  account  of  learning
    Bengali. There  were  also  concerns  as  to  the  claimant's  lack  of
    geographical knowledge of Myanmar and cultural  knowledge  of  Rohingya
    culture.

10. However, it is clear that the credibility of  the  ration  book  was  a
    central part of both the asylum claim and the reasons for refusal.

11. Judge Hembrough addressed the issue of the ration book and the apparent
    inconsistency of the date of entries between �13 and �15,  and  between
    �20 and �24 of the First-tier  Tribunal  decision.  At  �14  the  judge
    examined the ration book "and found its  appearance  to  be  consistent
    with its claimed age." It is not clear how the  judge  reached  such  a
    conclusion.  Neither  did  the  judge  explain  how  he  recognised  it
    contained both writing in English and in Bengali.

12. More significantly, the judge accepted  evidence  from  the  claimant's
    representative and sought confirmation from interpreter at  the  appeal
    hearing that the digit 4 in English  is  written  as  the  digit  8  in
    Bengali. I note from �13 that the representative of  the  Secretary  of
    State also pointed that in addition to the entry which appeared  to  be
    dated 1999, another entry appears to bear the date 2008.  This  appears
    at A13 of the bundle.

13. At  �15  of  the  decision  the  judge  explains  that  the  claimant's
    representative "submitted that given the dates of the entries  were  in
    issue it would be appropriate to adjourn the hearing in order that  the
    book could be translated." However, the judge refused,  considering  it
    unnecessary to have a complete translation of the book when only one or
    two entries were in issue, as it  would  cause  unnecessary  delay  and
    additional cost. The judge stated, "I was of the  view  that  the  date
    1998 to which reference is made in the reasons for refusal letter could
    equally and reasonably be read at 1994. Whilst observing  that  it  was
    not part of his duty to  translate  documents,  having  regard  to  the
    overriding objective in the Tribunal's procedure  rules,  I  asked  the
    interpreter if he could assist by at least confirming that the  English
    4 was written as 8 in Bengali which he did. Having considered the entry
    he said that the year was written in Bengali as 1994."

14. The grounds submit that the judge materially erred  in  law  by  taking
    evidence from the legal representative and asking  the  interpreter  to
    translate the document  and  provide  evidence  to  the  Tribunal.  The
    Secretary of State asserts that  this  was  a  procedural  irregularity
    capable of making a material difference to the fairness and outcome  of
    the appeal. Reliance is placed on BW (witness statements by  advocates)
    Afghanistan [2014] UKUT 00568 (IAC),  which  held,  "When  an  advocate
    makes a witness statement in the circumstances outlined above, a change
    of advocate may be necessary, since the roles of advocate  and  witness
    are distinct, separated by a bright luminous  line.  An  advocate  must
    never assume the role of witness."

15. When dealing with the dates in his Findings and Reason section  of  the
    decision, at �24 the judge noted the claimant's evidence as to how  the
    book came to be in his possession, stating that  it  was  an  old  book
    which was full. "This is consistent with the last entry being in  1994,
    four years before he claims to have left the camp. He said it was  left
    in a bag given to him by his uncle... when he left the camp and he kept
    it as a souvenir of sorts."

16. In granting permission to appeal on this  issue,  Judge  Lever  stated,
    "Whilst I have sympathy for the judge seeking to deal with the case  in
    a timely manner this book was a central feature of the case  and  dates
    appeared to be critical as to credibility  and  had  been  set  out  in
    advance in the refusal letter. The reasons provided  generally  by  the
    judge in the  decision  are  succinct.  It  was  also  noted  that  the
    appellant had entered the UK using a false document and had  failed  to
    claim asylum for 8 years. In the circumstances it is arguable that  the
    judge erred in his dealing with a central  piece  of  evidence  in  the
    manner described above. There were  arguable  errors  of  law  in  this
    case."

17. Unfortunately, there was some confusion in the judge's decision and  at
    the hearing before me as to which entries the judge  was  referring  to
    and the judge contributed further to this confusion by referring at �15
    to 1998, when the Secretary of State had alleged the entry was 1999, as
    the judge was aware from what is set out at �13. In  the  decision  the
    judge has transposed 1999 for 1998. However, from the judge's  copy  of
    the respondent's bundle, I can see, as I informed  the  parties  before
    me, that the judge has circled in pencil entries on pages A13 and  A19.
    Ms Brocklesby Weller produced the original exhibit and  thus  we  could
    all see that there was no such circling on the original  document.  The
    circled entry on A13 appears to be that relied on by the  Secretary  of
    State's representative at the First-tier  Tribunal  appeal  hearing  as
    being 2008. The entry  on  A19  is  the  one  the  Secretary  of  State
    suggested in the refusal decision to be 1999 and thus  post-dating  the
    claimant's alleged departure from the camp.

18. After I had pointed out that the judge appears to have  transposed  the
    date 1999 for 1998 when preparing the decision, Mr Butterworth observed
    that factual error was not part of the Secretary of State's grounds  of
    appeal and he had not had time to consider it.  The  error  seems  very
    obvious and had the Secretary of State applied to amend its  grounds  I
    would have considered  that  application  in  that  light.  However,  I
    granted Mr Butterworth time to take further instructions on  the  point
    and put the case back from 10:45 until it was called back on  again  at
    12:37. I consider this to have been more than adequate time to  address
    this issue.

19. On resumption of the hearing Mr Butterworth informed me that neither he
    nor Ms Brocklesby Weller had been able to work out why  the  judge  had
    referred to 1998. He suggested that the only way forward was  to  grant
    an adjournment to allow the parties to  better  address  this  apparent
    mistake of fact, which was not part of the grounds of  application  for
    permission to appeal, nor relied on  in  the  grant  of  permission  to
    appeal.

20. I refused the  adjournment  application  and  proceeded  to  hear  full
    argument on the  grounds  that  were  raised  in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal, namely the issue  of  taking  evidence  from  the
    claimant's representative and from the interpreter. The  burden  of  Mr
    Butterworth's submissions were that in neither case was  this  evidence
    and that in the  case  of  the  involvement  of  the  interpreter,  the
    interpreter did no more than interpret.

21. I find that there was absolutely nothing  improper  in  the  claimant's
    representative at the First-tier Tribunal appeal  hearing  saying  what
    she did say, that it was to her knowledge that the number 4 in  English
    being written in Bengali as 8. She was not attempting to give  evidence
    and said as much. What she was doing was justifying why she  sought  an
    adjournment, so the matter within her own knowledge could  properly  be
    put before the Tribunal.  The judge refused the adjournment request and
    instead asked the interpreter to assist.

22. There remains some confusion as to why the difference between 8  and  4
    was relevant, given that it is clear from  the  refusal  decision  that
    1999 was the relevant date that suggested the book could not relate  to
    this claimant. However, I find there was a material error of law in the
    judge taking evidence from the interpreter. The  interpreter  not  only
    confirmed that an English 4 is written as an 8 in Bengali, but he  went
    on to say that having considered the entry in the book, it was actually
    written as 1994. That is far  more  than  mere  interpretation  but  an
    opinion about what was actually written, i.e. the equivalent of  expert
    handwriting opinion. This was crucial to the central  document  at  the
    heart of the issue in the case as to whether the claimant left the camp
    when he claimed.

23. In AA (Language diagnosis: use of interpreters)  Somalia  [2008]  UKAIT
    00029, it was held that it was no part of an interpreter's function  to
    report on the  language  or  dialect  used.  The  expertise  needed  to
    identify a language or dialect is not typically  the  expertise  of  an
    interpreter. "In any  event,  an  interpreter  should  not  be  in  the
    position of giving, or being asked to give,  evidence  on  a  contested
    issue." I find that what the interpreter was asked to do  was  to  make
    him a witness on a highly contested issue that went to the heart of the
    case. This he should not have been asked to do and the judge should not
    have relied on it. I take into account Mr Butterworth's submission that
    the interpreter stayed within his official function to "comprehend  and
    communicate, not to assess and analyse" but to assess and analyse is in
    effect precisely what he did so.

24. I find that to rely  on  this  evidence  from  the  interpreter  was  a
    procedural irregularity and an error of law that  vitiated  the  entire
    decision such that it cannot stand and must be set aside to be remade.

25. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

26. In all the circumstances, I relist this appeal for a fresh  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal, I do so on the basis that this is a case which
    falls squarely within the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement  at
    paragraph 7.2. The effect of the error has been to deprive the  parties
    of a fair hearing and that the nature or extent of  any  judicial  fact
    finding which is necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made
    is such that, having regard to the overriding objective in  rule  2  to
    deal with cases fairly and justly,  including  with  the  avoidance  of
    delay, it is  appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to determine the appeal afresh.

27. It is to be hoped that the  confusion  referred  to  above  as  to  the
    entries in the medical book  in  issue  can  be  clarified  before  the
    hearing takes place.

Conclusions:

28. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be
                    reheard afresh with no findings of fact preserved.

Consequential Directions

29. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Harmondsworth  (or
    at such other hearing centre  as  the  Tribunal  may  direct)  for  the
    decision in the appeal to be remade afresh, with no findings preserved;

30. The estimated length of hearing is 3 hours;

31. An interpreter in Bangla will be required;

32. Not later than 14 days before the new hearing  of  the  appeal  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal and by letter to the claimant  and  copied  to  the
    Tribunal the Secretary of State must identify  with  particularity  the
    two entries in the medical book which  are  relied  on  to  demonstrate
    dates post the claimed departure of the claimant from the camp.


Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an anonymity direction. Given the  circumstances,  I  continue
that anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee  award.
I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
