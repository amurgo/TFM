Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr R Saravanan, Solicitor (AccuLegal Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of India, born on 25 May 1986.  His  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent dated 9  January  2014  refusing
    his application for leave to remain in the UK as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student Migrant was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Scobbie in a
    determination promulgated on 1 October 2014.

 2. The Judge found that for the purpose of  the  maintenance  requirements
    under the relevant  rule,  an  educational  loan  must  come  from  the
    country's national government rather than a financial institution.  Nor
    did  the  relevant  letter  produced  by  the  appellant  contain   the
    information required [19]. He  accordingly  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal under the Rules.

 3. The appellant in his grounds for permission contended that it had never
    been the  respondent's  case  that  the  letter  did  not  contain  the
    information required. On 17 November  2014,  the  appellant  was  given
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 4. Mr Saravanan relied on his written submissions which he adopted at  the
    hearing.

 5. It is common ground that the appellant came  to  the  UK  following  an
    entry clearance granted to him as a Tier 4 Student valid to 29  October
    2013.

 6. His application for further leave to remain as a student was refused on
    9 January 2014. He was not awarded any  points  under  the  maintenance
    requirements (Appendix C). That was on the basis that he had provided a
    letter from the Catholic  Syrian  Bank  confirming  that  he  had  been
    granted a loan in excess of ï¿½10,000. That letter was  not  accepted  by
    the respondent  as  the  loan  being  provided  was  from  a  financial
    institution.

 7. Mr Saravanan referred to the applicable rules in Appendix C. It  states
    at paragraph 1B(d) that if the  applicant  is  applying  as  a  Tier  4
    Migrant, an original loan letter must  be  produced  from  a  financial
    institution regulated for the purpose of student loans  by  either  the
    Financial  Conduct  Authority  (FCA),  and  the  Prudential  Regulation
    Authority (PRA), or in the case  of  overseas  accounts,  the  official
    regulatory body for the country or institution  is  in  and  where  the
    money is held, which is dated no more than six months before  the  date
    of the application showing the requisite information set out.

 8. It is not disputed that the relevant information was shown.  The letter
    was dated no more than six months before the date of  the  application.
    It also showed the applicant's  name,  the  date  of  the  letter,  the
    financial institution's name and logo, and that the money is  available
    as a loan.

 9. It is provided at sub-paragraph (5) that  for  applications  for  entry
    clearance, the loan funds are or will be  available  to  the  applicant
    before he travels to the UK, unless the loan is an academic or  student
    loan from the applicant's country's national  government  and  will  be
    released to the applicant on arrival in the  UK.  As  submitted  by  Ms
    Holmes that ensures that the money will be available for the student on
    arrival.

10. It is  further  provided  (sub-paragraph  6)  that  there  must  be  no
    conditions placed upon the release of the loan  funds.   Finally,  sub-
    paragraph 7  requires  that  the  loan  is  provided  by  the  national
    government, the state or regional government or a government  sponsored
    student loan company, or is part of that academic or educational  loans
    scheme.

11. The respondent contended that  the  appellant  failed  to  satisfy  the
    latter requirement - sub-paragraph 7 - as the loan was provided by  way
    of a letter from the Catholic  Syrian  Bank,  and  is  accordingly  not
    provided by the national government, state or regional government, or a
    government sponsored loan  company,  or  is  part  of  an  academic  or
    educational loan schemes.

12. Mr Saravanan submitted that the conditions referred to in sub-paragraph
    5 only apply to an entry clearance application and are  not  applicable
    to an in country application for leave to remain, as in the appellant's
    case. There can be loans from other sources.   The  only  condition  is
    that it should be  from  an  educational  loan  scheme.   Mr  Savaranan
    submitted that the loan can be from  financial  institutions  regulated
    for the purpose of student loans by the  official  regulatory  body  of
    India, namely, the Reserve Bank of India.

13. Ms Holmes accepted that the loan  sanction  letter  from  the  Catholic
    Syrian Bank Ltd set out the relevant details in the letter as  required
    by sub paragraph (d).

14. Ms Holmes relied on her written submissions. She set out  part  (d)  of
    Appendix C. She submitted that having sought advice on the  wording  of
    this paragraph, it is only sub paragraph 5 that applies specifically to
    entry clearance "because we want to know the funds are available before
    the  student  is  here."  Consequently,  there  is  no  difference   in
    treatment.

15. She submitted therefore that  the  appellant  in  this  case  needs  to
    demonstrate that with the exception of sub paragraph 5, he fulfils  all
    the requirements.

16. I allowed the parties the opportunity to ascertain whether the bank was
    regulated as required by the Rules.  Both have eventually responded.

    Assessment

17. I find that this appellant applied for further leave  to  remain  as  a
    Tier 4 student prior to the expiry of his leave. He applied from within
    the UK. He is thus required to provide an original loan letter  from  a
    financial institution regulated for the purpose of student loans by the
    official regulatory body for the country the institution is in.

18. There must be no conditions placed upon the release of the  loan  funds
    other than his making a successful application as a Tier 4 Migrant  and
    finally that the loan is provided by the national government, the state
    or regional government, or a government sponsored student loan company,
    or is part of an academic or educational loans scheme.

19. It is thus necessary for this appellant to provide the necessary letter
    from a financial institution  regulated  for  the  purpose  of  student
    loans, in this case, by the official regulatory body for India.

20. The loan letter that he produced was from the Catholic Syrian Bank.  Ms
    Holmes accepted that that bank relates  to  an  overseas  account.  She
    accepted that the bank is regulated by the official regulatory body for
    India. The bank is approved by the Home Office.

21. In his written submissions dated 5 May 2015 Mr Saravanan  produced  the
    consolidated statute, namely, the Reserve Bank of  India  Act  1934  as
    amended up to 7 January 2013.

22. It is evident from the legislation that the Reserve Bank  of  India  is
    the official regulatory body regulating and controlling banks in India.
    The Reserve Bank of India derived its powers under the Reserve Bank  of
    India Act 1934. The banks in India are also controlled by  the  Banking
    Regulations Act 1949, a copy of which has been provided. The latter Act
    consolidates and amends the law relating to banking and extends to  the
    whole of India.

23. The schedule to the Reserve Bank of India Act  has  a  list  of  Indian
    banks classified as  such  and  regulated  by  the  Reserve  Bank.  The
    Catholic Syrian Bank which provided the loan letter to the appellant is
    identified in the schedule.

24. The Banking Regulation Act 1949 enables and empowers the  Reserve  Bank
    of India to issue notification, directions, circulations and the  like,
    having effective supervision and control of the scheduled banks.

25. The Reserve Bank of India derives powers and  directions  to  supervise
    educational loan schemes and has issued circulars.

26. Mr Saravanan has also produced a  document  headed  "Educational  Loans
    Scheme" dated April 2001. The finance minister in a  meeting  with  the
    Chief Executives of the public sector banks  highlighted  the  role  of
    commercial banks in facilitating the pursuit  of  higher  education  by
    poor, but meritorious students. In pursuance thereof, the Indian Banks'
    Association - IBA - constituted a study group under the chairmanship of
    one of the  banks  to  examine  the  issue  in  detail.  Based  on  the
    recommendation of the study group  a  comprehensive  model  educational
    loan scheme was prepared by the Indian banks' association for  adoption
    by all banks. The scheme aims at providing financial support  from  the
    banking system to  deserving  and  meritorious  students  for  pursuing
    higher education in India and abroad.

27. The government of India, Ministry of Finance,  Department  of  Economic
    Affairs (Banking Division) considered and decided to  adopt  the  Model
    Scheme  prepared  by  IBA  for  implementation   subject   to   various
    modifications.  A  copy  of  the  model  scheme  prepared  by  IBA  for
    implementation  by  banks  was  forwarded  so  that  its  benefits  are
    available to students from this academic session.

28. I have had  regard  to  the  legislation  as  well  as  the  applicable
    educational loans scheme.  The  model  scheme  is  subject  to  various
    modifications and regulates conditions relating to  minimum  qualifying
    marks, the margin that may be insisted upon for loans up to Rs.4  lakh.
    No security may be insisted upon for loans up to Rs.4 lakh. Subject  to
    those modifications, the model scheme for implementation by  the  banks
    were submitted so that its benefits would become available to  students
    from the earliest academic session.

29. Appendix P to the Immigration Rules lists the names of the Indian banks
    whose statements can be accepted and the Catholic Syrian Bank is on the
    list.

30. From the documentation produced I am  accordingly  satisfied  that  the
    appellant has provided evidence from the official regulatory  body  for
    India that the Catholic Syrian Bank was regulated for  the  purpose  of
    student loans by the official regulatory body of India.

31. Ms Holmes has subsequently accepted that the bank is regulated for  the
    purpose of the Rules.

Notice of Decision

32. The First-tier Tribunal Judge made an error of law and the decision  is
    set aside.

33. I substitute a fresh decision allowing the appeal.
