Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr A Pipe, instructed by Khan & Co
For the respondent:    Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Jabran Muhammad, date of birth 3.5.83, is a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Nixon promulgated 12.3.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 21.12.12, to refuse  his  application
    made on 26.6.12 for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a  spouse,
    pursuant to paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules.   The  Judge  heard
    the appeal on 7.3.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Woodcraft refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    2.5.14.  However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman granted permission to appeal  on
    29.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 19.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Nixon should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  briefly  summarised  as
    follows. The application made in June 2012 was based on the appellant's
    marriage in Pakistan on 10.6.10 to Shazia Khan, a British  citizen  now
    present in the UK. The appellant and the sponsor are related outside of
    marriage as cousins. They last saw each other in November 2011.

 7. It is relevant to note that two previous applications had been  refused
    and appeals dismissed, in 2007 and 2011, in which false representations
    had been made.

 8. The application was refused on  the  basis  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that  the  appellant  would  be  able  to  be
    adequate accommodated in the UK without recourse to  public  funds,  as
    required by paragraph 281(iv).  Of  particular  concern  was  that  the
    appellant's spouse resided in a house  at  an  address  given  (details
    withheld), address A, owned by her relative(s), but the  housing  costs
    were met by public funds. There was  no  evidence  that  the  wife  was
    registered  at  or  occupying  this  property.  At  the  time  of   the
    application she was living at a different address, (details  withheld),
    address B, and there was no evidence that the other  address  would  be
    adequate to accommodate the appellant.

 9. Judge Nixon highlighted the  inconsistent  evidence  in  the  appellant
    case. In particular, that the sponsor claimed  she  started  living  at
    address A in February 2013 and notified the council, so she  could  pay
    her share of the due council tax. She claimed to be  unaware  that  Mrs
    Begum was claiming council tax credit for that address and said it  was
    an error that the entire council tax bill was in  the  sponsor's  name.
    Two different property reports had been produced, one listing Mrs Begum
    and Mr M Zaman as the owners, the  other  containing  no  reference  to
    them. The judge disbelieved the sponsor's evidence, in particular as to
    alleged coincidence between a claimed weekly income of �217.52 and  the
    second council tax instalment.

10. Judge Nixon concluded that the appellant had failed to  demonstrate  on
    the balance of probabilities that adequate accommodation was  available
    and thus the appeal failed under the  Immigration  Rules.  Judge  Nixon
    went on to consider the appellant's and  the  sponsor's  circumstances,
    including their young child, under article 8 ECHR, following the Razgar
    steps, but concluding that the decision was entirely proportionate.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Freeman noted that the  renewed
    grounds rely on PS (paragraph 320(11) discretion: care  needed)  [2010]
    UKUT 440. "Although the appellant was  represented  before  the  judge,
    arguably she should have offered an adjournment where paragraph 320(11)
    was raised for the  first  time  before  her,  so  that  the  necessary
    'aggravating circumstances' could be properly considered.

12. The reliance by the judge on paragraph 320(11) of the Immigration Rules
    at �6 of the decision was  an  additional  ground  for  dismissing  the
    appeal on immigration grounds, on the basis that  there  had  been  two
    previous attempts to deceive in the previous applications.

13. In PS, the Upper Tribunal panel  held  that  in  exercising  discretion
    under paragraph 320(11) to refuse an application  for  entry  clearance
    where the automatic prohibition is disapplied  by  virtue  of  320(7C),
    "the  decision  maker  must  exercise  great  care  in  assessing   the
    aggravating circumstances said to justify refusal and must have  regard
    to the public interest in encouraging those unlawfully  in  the  UK  to
    leave and seek to regularise their status by an application  for  entry
    clearance." Paragraph 320(7B) provides a mandatory refusal where, inter
    alia, deception had  been  used  in  a  previous  application.  320(7C)
    disapplies that  mandatory  refusal  in  a  spousal  application  under
    paragraph 281. However, 320(11) provides  a  discretionary  refusal  in
    circumstances, including using deception in an  application  for  entry
    clearance, where there are aggravating circumstances. In setting out  a
    non-exhaustive list of aggravating circumstances, the Guidance explains
    that all cases have to be considered on their merits.

14. In the present case, the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  did  not  rely  on
    320(11);  it  was  raised  for  the  first  time  by  the  respondent's
    representative at the appeal hearing. In consideration of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal, whilst it is clear that the judge  took  an
    adverse view of the credibility of the appellant and the sponsor, it is
    not clear that there was any careful consideration of  the  aggravating
    circumstances. It is also fair to point  out  that  the  appellant  had
    little, if any, notice that this issue would be raised. It is not clear
    to me what an adjournment could have accomplished, since the  facts  of
    the two previous refusal decisions and subsequent  appeals  would  have
    been well known to both appellant and sponsor. However, it was probably
    unfair to rely on this issue at such short notice. It follows that this
    part of the decision cannot stand. However, this is  not  determinative
    of the outcome of the appeal, as  the  judge  reached  the  independent
    conclusion,  referred  to  above,  that  the  appeal  failed   on   the
    accommodation requirements of paragraph 281.

15. Judge Freeman did not grant permission to appeal in relation to article
    8 grounds, but in any event I agree entirely  with  the  assessment  of
    Judge Woodcraft when refusing permission to appeal that article  8  was
    correctly assessed, with the judge properly directing  herself  on  the
    best interests of the child. I also agree that the grounds in  relation
    to article 8 are no more than a disagreement with the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal. I am satisfied that the  decision  in  respect  of
    article 8, as well as on immigration grounds, was entirely  sustainable
    on the evidence and for which the judge has supplied cogent  reasoning.
    In the circumstances  I  reject  the  submission  that  the  article  8
    assessment was flawed, as claimed in the  grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal.



Conclusion & Decision:

16. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
