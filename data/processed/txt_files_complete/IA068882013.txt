Representation:

Appellant:    Ms R. Chapman, counsel, instructed by South West London Law
Centres
Respondent:   Ms A. Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, who is a citizen of Jamaica born  on  10th  March  1950,
    appeals against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow who,  by
    a determination promulgated on 2nd September 2013, dismissed her appeal
    on human rights grounds against a decision of the respondent  that  she
    should be removed from the UK pursuant to s10  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 1999.

 2. The challenges to that determination raised in the grounds for  seeking
    permission to appeal are neatly summarised by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Grant-Hutchinson who said this in granting permission to appeal:

                  "It is arguable that the judge  failed  to  give  adequate
                  reasons in the proportionality exercise in relation to (a)
                  why it would be in the economic interests  of  the  UK  to
                  remove the appellant when she is looking after her  sister
                  when it was suggested in submissions that the  appellant's
                  presence would  save  ï¿½24,000  per  annum  for  additional
                  formal care from the State; (b)  making  any  findings  in
                  relation to the Independent social worker's report  (Peter
                  Horrocks) on the impact that the appellant's removal would
                  have on her sister and uncle who are looked after  by  the
                  appellant and rely on her; (c) by making any  findings  in
                  relation to the views of both the sister and the uncle  on
                  the impact of the appellant's removal would have on  their
                  lives [sic]; (d) by making any findings in relation to the
                  impact of the appellant's removal on her daughter  Romalyn
                  who has mental health issues and (e) the particular impact
                  on her granddaughter for whom the appellant  provides  her
                  with consistency and stability which her  own  mother  has
                  difficulties doing because of her mental health condition.
                  No findings have been made in  relation  to  Mr  Horrock's
                  opinion that the appellant's removal would not be  in  the
                  child's best interests and it is arguable that  inadequate
                  reason [sic] have been given as to why  the  child's  best
                  interests would be met by support agencies."

 3. By some measure, as we indicated to the parties at the commencement  of
    the hearing, the most important arguable shortcoming in  the  reasoning
    of the First tier Tribunal identified in the grounds of  permission  to
    appeal concerns the predicted impact of the Appellant's removal on  her
    granddaughter, who is aged 12 years.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
    found ([21] of the First-tier Tribunal determination):

                  "......it has been established that the appellant plays  a
                  significant role in the life [the granddaughter]  and  her
                  mother Romalyn. She provides a certain sense of  stability
                  that would otherwise be lacking. If the appellant is to be
                  returned to Jamaica it appears that  Romalyn,  accompanied
                  by [the granddaughter] may decide to follow the appellant.
                  In this  event  the  stability  that  [the  granddaughter]
                  requires will be maintained. Such a  decision  is  however
                  likely to be challenged by [the  granddaughter's]  father,
                  the outcome of which is, needless to say is unknown. Since
                  her birth she has lived all her life in the UK and  should
                  she need further support and care that can be provided  by
                  all of the agencies responsible for children in the UK. In
                  all of the  circumstances  the  appellant's  case  finally
                  founded  [sic]  on  leave  to  remain  to  care  for  [the
                  granddaughter]  fails  as  there  are   adequate   support
                  agencies, along with her mother and other family  members,
                  in the  UK  to  provide  for  her  wellbeing.  As  to  the
                  appellant personally it was not suggested,  save  for  the
                  family life claim, it was unreasonable for her  to  return
                  to Jamaica."

 4. Although the judge quoted extensively from the report  by  Mr  Horrocks
    ([5.1 to 5.4] of the report) in  the  determination,  the  content  and
    conclusions of which were not, it seems, challenged by  the  respondent
    before the First-tier Tribunal (or indeed before us), he does  not,  in
    reaching his conclusions as to the best interests of the grandchild  or
    the proportionality of the decision  factor  these  elements  into  his
    conclusions. There was no acknowledgement in reaching  his  conclusion,
    despite reference in the quote from the report, of  the  child's  elder
    sister becoming a looked after child for  four  years  because  of  the
    family history; that the appellant appears to be the primary carer  for
    the child; that the child's mother is emotionally  unstable;  that  the
    removal of the appellant to Jamaica would potentially expose the  child
    to a similar situation as her older sister with  implications  for  her
    future care needs. Although the judge refers to the likely challenge by
    her father to the child going  to  Jamaica  and  that  support  can  be
    provided by various care agencies, he makes no assessment of the actual
    impact upon the child.

 5.   Although permission to appeal was granted on other matters,  we  took
    the view having heard submissions from both parties that those  matters
    were in fact peripheral to the significant and substantial shortcomings
    in the reasoning and conclusion of the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  as
    regards the best interest of the child being  a  primary  consideration
    and the 'Article 8 assessment'. We are satisfied that there is a  quite
    inadequate exposition of this child's best interests  in  the  critical
    passages in the judgment, in paragraph [21].

 6. We  have  concluded  that,  within  the  parameters  of  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal, an error of  law  is  clearly  demonstrated.  The
    materiality of this error is unmistakable, as  it  is  germane  to  the
    decision made. Accordingly, we set aside the determination of the First-
    tier Tribunal and proceed to remake it. There was no challenge  to  the
    evidence, as recorded in the First-tier Tribunal determination  and  it
    was agreed by  the  parties  that  there  was  no  necessity  for  oral
    evidence. The documents before us were the same as  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal with the addition of a letter ....

 7. In reaching our decision we have considered the two  legal  grounds  in
    play, which are Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention and Section 55
    of the 2009 Act.  There was some discussion before us as to whether the
    decision to remove the  appellant  was  or  was  not  in  the  economic
    interest of society. Although Ms Chapman placed reliance on the  public
    monies she asserted were saved by the appellant's  presence  in  caring
    for her other relatives we are not  satisfied,  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence before us, that the care currently provided by  the  appellant
    to her sister and her uncle is care that would  otherwise  be  provided
    through public funds.  We  do  however,  of  course,  accept  that  the
    assistance given by the appellant to the emotional well  being  of  her
    family members is a factor to be taken into  account,  particularly  in
    relation to the issue of proportionality.

 8. We consider that, as regards Article 8, the key test to be  applied  is
    that of proportionality.  This is uncontentious as between the parties.
     There is no clear blue water between the Article 8 issue in this  case
    and the Section 55 issue.  However, what Section 55 does in the present
    case is to focus attention very substantially on the one affected child
    and all of the various factors bearing on that child's best  interests.



 9. Having noted above that there was no challenge to Mr Horrock's  report,
    we turn to consider it in a little detail.   Mr  Horrocks  has  been  a
    social worker, team manager and senior manager in  both  statutory  and
    non statutory settings. There was no challenge by the respondent to his
    expertise or experience. The report was prepared  following  interviews
    with the appellant,  the  appellant's  older  sister,  the  appellant's
    daughter,  the  appellant's  two  granddaughters  ((daughters  of   her
    daughter; R and A), the appellant's uncle, the appellant's  cousin  and
    the appellant's son and daughter in law. Having  rehearsed  extensively
    the family structure, tensions and problems, Mr Horrocks concludes:

          1. Ms Beckford plays a matriarchal role in this family and  is  a
             central figure in terms of both the  practical  and  emotional
             support she provides for her extended  family.  A  significant
             aspect of this family's functioning is the  implication  of  a
             history of poor mental health which continues from  generation
             to generation....She has now been in the UK for thirteen years
             and over that time [her sister] has become dependant  on  her,
             more for her emotional needs as opposed to her practical  care
             needs... [if the appellant  returned  to  Jamaica]  she  would
             struggle to cope with the increased isolation,  leading  to  a
             significant downward spiral both in terms of her physical  and
             mental health.
          2. ....[appellant's daughter] is  emotionally  unstable,  whether
             this is directly linked  to  her  mental  health  is  unclear,
             although she has been previously  treated  for  depression.  [
             oldest daughter of appellant's daughter] became a looked after
             child at the age of thirteen and spent four  years  placed  in
             residential care...at enormous expense .......Ms Beckford does
             appear to be in many ways the primary carer  for  [appellant's
             daughter's  youngest   daughter]   and   provides   her   with
             consistency and stability, an area where  the  child's  mother
             appears to have difficulties.
          3. The removal of Ms Beckford to Jamaica would potentially expose
             the child to a similar situation to that of her older  sister,
             with  implications  for  her  future  care   needs   and   the
             possibility of a breakdown in  the  relationship  between  the
             child and her mother as appears to have happened  with  [older
             child].  The  alternative   situation   whereby   [appellant's
             daughter] would choose to return with her  mother  to  Jamaica
             would lead to the child being separated from her  father,  who
             plays a significant role in her life. It could  also  lead  to
             the child becoming involved in court proceedings because of  a
             custody dispute and the child  would  be  exposed  to  serious
             discord between her parents unnecessarily. Additionally  [she]
             would be separated from her older sister."


10. Ms Everett accepted in her submissions that  the  relationship  between
    the appellant and the  younger  granddaughter  would  be  significantly
    compromised if the appellant were removed to Jamaica but cast doubt  on
    whether the evidence was sufficient to show that her welfare would also
    be compromised. She submitted that the child could  expect  to  receive
    considerable emotional support from other relatives in the UK.

11. The best interests of a child are not a mere  formulaic  expression  of
    the practical situation of the child. Rather, they require a  panoramic
    assessment of a broad spectrum of considerations and relationships.  In
    this case, the family as a whole has functional problems; the appellant
    plays a significant role in the adequate functioning of the family  and
    is in many ways the primary carer of the child.  We  consider  that  to
    remove the appellant would be to remove  the  child's  main  carer.  To
    disrupt the emotional and physical well being of a 12  year  old  child
    requires more justification than a mere  assertion  that  other  family
    members, many of whom are dysfunctional  and  suffer  from  mental  and
    physical health problems,  would  be  able  to  provide  the  necessary
    support to enable this child not to be significantly affected. We  find
    that the older child and the child's mother would be unable to  provide
    the level of physical and  emotional  support  that  the  appellant  is
    providing to this child. Ms Everett  submitted  that  although  it  was
    clear that the appellant provides practical support and a caring  role,
    some level of contact could be maintained if she  were  removed.  While
    this is correct, its intrinsic limitations must  be  appreciated.   The
    physical and emotional support provided by the appellant to  the  child
    is on a daily basis and amounts to more than could be substituted  with
    a conversation via Skype, Viber, facebook or email.

12. Although there would be elements of disruption to other members of  the
    appellant's  family  we  are  satisfied  that  were  it  not  for   the
    significant and serious effect of removal on the  child,  it  would  be
    unlikely that this would be sufficient to amount to a  disproportionate
    exercise of  immigration  control.  We  heard  little  in  the  way  of
    submissions  as  regards  this  element  of  the  grounds,  given   our
    unchallenged indication  as  to  the  importance  of  the  relationship
    between the child and the appellant.

13. Accordingly we have come to the  clear  conclusion  that  the  impugned
    decision of the Secretary  of  State  is  disproportionate  within  the
    meaning of Article 8(2) ECHR and, secondly, fails to give proper effect
    to the best interests principle enshrined in Section 55.  The  evidence
    impelling to this conclusion is  compelling.   Accordingly,  we  differ
    with deference from the First-tier Tribunal and we allow the appeal.


DECISION

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. We set aside the decision.

15. We re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it  on  human  rights
    grounds (Article 8).
