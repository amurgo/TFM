Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis
For the Respondent:    Ms Cole-Wilson


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. For ease and continuity I refer to the parties hereafter as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal so that Mrs Konjuvca  is  the  appellant
    and the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the respondent.

 2. The appellant was refused entry clearance under Appendix FM of  HC  395
    (as amended) to come to the United Kingdom on the basis of her marriage
    to Mr A Konjuvca.  The sole reason for refusal was that the sponsor, Mr
    Konjuvca,  was  said  to  be  unable  to  meet  the  strict   financial
    requirements of the Rules regarding proof of income.

 3. The matter  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Elliman.   In  a
    determination promulgated on 22 April 2014 the appeal was allowed under
    the Immigration Rules.

 4. The respondent sought permission to appeal that decision on  the  basis
    that although it  was  clear  that  at  the  date  of  application  the
    sponsor's actual gross annual income was below the necessary threshold,
    and as a result the maintenance requirements could  not  be  fulfilled,
    the Tribunal  nevertheless  found  wrongly  that  it  was  entitled  to
    consider the evidence of the circumstances of the sponsor at  the  date
    of the decision.

 5. Permission was granted on the  basis  that  it  was  arguable  that  in
    failing  to  consider  the  (financial)  situation  at  the   date   of
    application the judge erred.

My Deliberations

 6. At paragraph 9 of the determination the judge states that  it  was  not
    necessary to hear oral evidence  as  the  only  issue  related  to  the
    documentation provided by the sponsor and his status as either employed
    or self-employed.  The judge found that the matter had  been  addressed
    by the evidence submitted with the application and in  the  appellant's
    further appeal bundle.

 7. Later in paragraph 9 the judge set out an extract from paragraph  2  of
    Appendix FM-SE of the Rules. Although setting  out  those  requirements
    the judge does not show how the appellant meets that part of the Rules.

 8. The Rules stipulate at FM-SE D that the  date  of  application  is  the
    relevant date for provision of the required evidence, save for  certain
    exceptions that do not apply here. Paragraph 10  of  the  determination
    does not deal with the point at all.  The judge finds that at the  time
    of the application the sponsor had only just started to earn the higher
    salary that would bring the appellant within the  requirements  of  the
    Rules, but because the judge was entitled to consider the  evidence  of
    the circumstances at the date of decision that meant that the appellant
    met those requirements.  She did not because  the  rules  required  the
    appellant to provide the relevant evidence with the  application.  What
    was provided showed that the sponsor had not met the rule requiring him
    to provide payslips from his current employer covering a  period  of  6
    months prior to the date of application.

 9. The alternative method of proving sufficient funds available to him  to
    allow the appellant to meet  the  rules  would  have  been  to  provide
    evidence of any period of salaried  employment  in  the  period  of  12
    months prior to the date of application together with a letter from the
    employer who issued the payslips confirming certain details. He  needed
    to provide also personal bank statements showing that  the  salary  has
    been paid into that account, all of which is detailed in  Appendix  FM-
    SE.

10. The judge found that the sponsor had only  just  started  to  earn  the
    salary that would meet the requirements as to sufficiency  of  earnings
    but did not make any findings and to how he met the other parts of  the
    rule as quoted by the judge at paragraph 9 of  the  determination.   In
    coming to her findings in favour of the appellant in the manner and for
    the reasons that she does, the judge clearly fell into  error  and  the
    decision has to be set aside, as I announced at the hearing.

The further hearing

11. Ms Cole-Wilson was not in a position to show that the evidence provided
    could lead to a conclusion that the appellant met the  requirements  of
    the Rules at the  relevant  time.   It  is  clear  from  the  sponsor's
    statement (paragraph 15) that at the date of application, which was  12
    September 2012, the sponsor's salary had increased to �20496.00 but had
    only done so from 1 September 2012. Prior to the date of application it
    had been below the minimum required  of  �18600.00,  at  �16800.00  per
    annum. For that  reason  the  maintenance  requirements  could  not  be
    fulfilled and the appellant could not succeed in the appeal.

12. If, as appears possible, or even likely, the sponsor's  income  is  now
    above the relevant threshold a further application by the appellant may
    be successful.  However, that is not a matter for me to decide.

Decision

13. For the above reasons the decision of the First-tier Judge is set aside
    and for it is substituted a decision that the appeal is dismissed under
    the Immigration Rules.

14. No anonymity direction has previously been made and  none  was  applied
    for.  I do not find that the circumstances warrant one being  made  and
    therefore I do not do so.
