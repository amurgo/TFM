Representation:

For the Appellant: Ms Fisher, Counsel instructed by M Reale Solicitors,
London
For the Respondent: Mr Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellant is a citizen of Colombia whose date of birth is recorded
      as 2 September 1986. He was granted a visa as a student on 3 September
      2004 and thereafter his leave was renewed on several  occasions  until
      on 23 May 2013 he applied for a  residence  card  as  a  person  in  a
      durable  relationship  having  regard  to  the  Immigration  (European
      Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

   2. On 22 September 2013 the Secretary of  State  decided  to  refuse  the
      application and the Appellant appealed.  The appeal was  heard  on  19
      March 2014 by Judge A W Khan sitting as a First-tier Tribunal Judge at
      Richmond Magistrates Court.

   3. When the matter came before Judge Khan, the basis of  the  Appellant's
      claim had changed.  He was no longer in a durable relationship and  so
      the Appellant sought to rely on his rights having regard to Article  8
      of the European Convention on Human Rights.

   4. The basis of the claim as advanced before  Judge  Khan  was  that  the
      Appellant, having arrived in the  United  Kingdom  in  2004  had  been
      engaged in studies and then in August 2013 began a  business,  selling
      clothes.  It was part of the Appellant's case that as a homosexual  he
      would not have the freedom in Colombia which he was  enjoying  in  the
      United Kingdom and would have to lead a "double life."

   5. It was accepted that the Appellant could not succeed  under  paragraph
      276ADE of the Immigration Rules and so he sought to rely on the  wider
      considerations of Article 8.

   6. Judge Khan did not accept that the Appellant was homosexual  but  went
      on to consider whether even if it were established that he was whether
      the Appellant should succeed under Article 8.  Judge Khan came to  the
      view that the Appellant's appeal should be dismissed.

   7. Not content with the Determination and  findings  of  Judge  Khan,  by
      Notice  dated  11  April  2014  the  Appellant  made  application  for
      permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   A number of grounds were
      raised which are summarised at paragraph 4 of the grounds:

      "i) The Judge failed to identify the standard of proof he was applying
         when making his finding;

      ii) The Judge  failed  to  give  proper  consideration  to  the  fifth
         consideration in the  Razgar  test  (proportionality)  and,  in  so
         doing, failed to give sufficient weight to material matters;

      iii)    The Judge's  finding  that  the  Appellant  is  not  "gay"  is
         deficient for a lack  of  adequate  reasoning,  placing  weight  on
         immaterial matters and a  failure  to  give  sufficient  weight  to
         material matters."

   8. On 25 April 2014 Judge Simpson granted permission, though  whilst  not
      ruling out any of the grounds relied upon,  did  so,  it  would  seem,
      because of the silence as to the burden and standard of proof  in  the
      Determination.

   9. The Appellant was valiantly represented by Ms Fisher.  She prepared  a
      skeleton argument which runs to  twelve  paragraphs  and  I  have  had
      regard to it. At paragraph 7 it is submitted  that  the  Judge,  "Gave
      little consideration to the fact that  the  Appellant  has  spent  his
      entire adult life in the United Kingdom and has built up  his  private
      life whilst he has been lawfully here."

  10. By reference to the guidance in the case of Ogundimu  (Article  8  New
      Rules) Nigeria [2013] UK UT and MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192,  it
      was submitted that whilst the Immigration Rules are the starting point
      still a judge should go on to consider the wider aspect of  Article  8
      and at paragraph 11 of the skeleton argument Ms Fisher says in terms:

           "It is therefore clear that the Court of  Appeal  accepted  that
           there still had to be a two stage test."

  11. I deal firstly  with  the  burden  and  standard  of  proof.   In  the
      strictest sense nowhere in the Judge's determination does he say where
      the burden and standard of proof fell.  However, the question  that  I
      have to determine is whether the judge in fact erred.   I  invited  Ms
      Fisher to address me as to the various standards of proof which  might
      have  been  applied.   She  agreed  that  there  exists  the  criminal
      standard, the civil standard and the  lower  standard  (applicable  in
      asylum cases).  Ms Fisher did not submit that the  judge  had  applied
      any particular standard of proof but rather submitted that it was  not
      possible to know from the determination what  standard  of  proof  had
      been applied.  I do not agree.  Mr Whitwell for the Secretary of State
      pointed to paragraph 6 of the Appellant's own grounds which states:

           "Whilst there is  no  need  for  trite  law  to  be  recited  by
           Immigration Judges in their determinations on a  routine  basis,
           it is submitted that it is of  fundamental  importance  that  an
           Immigration Judge makes  clear  the  standard  to  which  he  is
           measuring an Appellants and submissions."

  12. I find that reading the determination as a whole it is clear that  the
      judge has applied the  appropriate  civil  standard  to  the  material
      findings which were to be made.  As to the issue whether  or  not  the
      Appellant was homosexual which the judge  did  not  find  established,
      that adverse finding is not material because at paragraph  19  of  the
      determination the judge proceeded on the alternative  basis  that  the
      Appellant had established that he was homosexual.   What  is  more  at
      paragraph 24 of the determination when pulling  together  the  various
      strands  following  his  findings,  the  judge  uses  both  the  words
      "proportionate" and  "disproportionate."   It  is  clear  reading  the
      determination as a whole that the judge understood that  there  was  a
      balancing exercise to be done.

  13. Where the burden of proof lies clearly matters when  the  evidence  is
      found to be evenly balanced or equivocal. But where  the  judge  finds
      that it is not evenly balanced then it does not  matter  in  any  real
      sense where the burden of proof lies in a  case  such  as  this  since
      whoever had the burden, the case  would  have  resulted  in  the  same
      finding.  Further reading paragraph 24 of  the  determination  in  the
      context of the determination as a whole the following:

           "...However, any interference in it [private life] would  be  in
           accordance with the law, in pursuit of the permissible aims  set
           out under Article 8(2) namely  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the
           country,  in  this  case  immigration   control   and   entirely
           proportionate to such permissible aim."

      Gives further support to the finding that the  judge  knew  where  the
      burden of proof lay.

  14. Though Ms Fisher relied on the cases of Ogundimu and MF Nigeria, there
      is other guidance which is material to this  case.   I  refer  to  two
      cases in particular:   Gulshan  (Article  8  -  New  Rules  -  Correct
      Approach) [2013] UK UT640 and Patel and Others v  Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department [2013] UK SC72. As to  Gulshan,  the  relevant
      point of law can be taken from the head note at (b) which reads:

           "After applying the requirements of the rules, only if there may
           be arguably good grounds for granting leave  to  remain  outside
           them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider
           whether there  are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
           recognised under them."

  15. Whilst Gulshan is a decision of the Upper Tribunal, there is  guidance
      to be found in the case of Patel.  At paragraph 57 Lord Carnworth said
      that: "It is important to remember that Article 8  is  not  a  general
      dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished  from  the  Secretary  of
      State's discretion to allow leave to remain outside  the  rules  which
      may be unrelated  to  any  protected  human  right.   The  merits  for
      decision not to depart from the rules are not reviewable on appeal."

  16. It was  also  said  at  paragraph  54  that  the  starting  point  for
      consideration of Article 8 is the Immigration Rule itself,  though  of
      course the possibility of looking to the wider application of  Article
      8 is clearly not ruled out by the speech of Lord Carnworth.

  17. Given the guidance including R (on the application of MM) v  Secretary
      of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2013]  EWHC  1900:  R  (on  the
      application of) Nagre v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2013] EWHC 720 and more recently Shahzad (Article 8 - Legitimate aim)
      [2014] UK UT00085 what emerges is that the immigration rules amount to
      a complete code.  However, where there is a situation  not  adequately
      contemplated by the rules then the wider aspect of Article 8 should be
      examined, which is another way of saying that unless  there  is  "some
      compelling reason" it is not necessary to go further.

  18. In this case I invited Ms Fisher to list for me all of  those  factors
      which she said were material to  the  Appellant's  case  and  why  the
      appeal should have been allowed.  She listed six matters:

        1) That the Appellant had lawfully been in the United  Kingdom  for
           9� years and therefore just six months short of the  requirement
           in Paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.

        2) The Appellant has spent all his adult life in the United Kingdom
           having arrived when he was 18.

        3) He has studied in the United Kingdom.

        4) He has worked in the United Kingdom.

        5) He has a number of relatives in the United Kingdom.

        6) He has friends "In the  gay  scene"  and  he  has  private  life
           friendships.

  19. The difficulty which I see for Ms Fisher and the Appellant is that the
      judge was clearly aware of all of those factors.  At paragraph  17  he
      says:

           "In deciding whether the  Appellant  has  severed  his  ties  to
           Colombia, I have looked at the whole  of  the  evidence  in  the
           round.  I accept that the Appellant has been living  in  the  UK
           since 2004 when he was 18 years old and that he has  obtained  a
           number of educational qualifications and has been working in the
           UK.  There is therefore clearly a private  life  but  I  am  not
           satisfied that he has no ties  in  Colombia,  including  social,
           cultural or family ties.   The  Appellant  speaks  Spanish,  the
           language of Colombia and he has kept in touch  with  his  family
           there.  It seems the real reason why the Appellant does not want
           to return to Colombia is because of his sexual  orientation  and
           he claims he would not be able to practice this freely."

  20. As I have already said, the judge did not accept  that  the  Appellant
      had established that he  was  homosexual  but  that  is  not  material
      because as I have also said,  from  paragraph  19  onwards  the  judge
      examined the risks to the Appellant were he to return to Colombia.  He
      used the case of HJ (Iran) [2010] UK SC31 which provides  guidance  in
      the case of those claiming refugee status but  nevertheless  that  the
      judge considered how the Appellant might be affected as  a  homosexual
      in Iran cannot, in my judgment be criticised.  Indeed he was right  to
      do that.  It goes to the Appellant's  moral  and  physical  integrity;
      something which Ms Fisher said the judge had had  insufficient  regard
      to.  I do not agree.  The judge has gone to some lengths  to  consider
      how the Appellant's life might be different in  Colombia.   Ms  Fisher
      submitted that the judge had misapplied HJ (Iran) because  whilst  the
      Appellant lived openly as a homosexual in the United  Kingdom  it  was
      his case that he would not be able so to do in Colombia. But the House
      of Lords set out the appropriate test  at  paragraph  35.   The  first
      question to determine was whether or not the applicant was indeed gay.
       The judge proceeded on that basis from  paragraph  19.   It  is  then
      necessary to look at the situation on  return  but  it  would  not  be
      sufficient to say that an applicant would not be able  to  do  in  the
      country of his nationality everything he can do openly in the  country
      whose protection he seeks.  Nevertheless if it  were  found  that  the
      applicant would conceal  aspects  of  his  sexual  orientation  it  is
      necessary to see whether that is in response to  social  pressures  or
      for cultural or religious reasons of his own choosing rather than fear
      of persecution.  The judge addressed these questions at paragraphs  20
      and 21.  I accept that it was not necessary for the judge to go so far
      as to consider whether  the  Appellant  would  be  persecuted  in  his
      consideration of the moral and physical integrity aspect of the  claim
      but Ms Fisher agreed that applying the five stage test in Razgar, once
      the Appellant raised his sexual orientation it was  not  inappropriate
      for the judge to ask himself whether there was a risk  of  persecution
      because it would go to the third question in Razgar namely whether the
      decision of the Secretary of State was in accordance with the law.  It
      would not be in accordance with the law if the Appellant were indeed a
      refugee since it would be unlawful to remove him.

  21. Ms Fisher however takes a different point.  She submits that the issue
      of refugee status was not  raised.   The  burden  of  the  Appellant's
      submission was that the fact that he was homosexual went to his  moral
      and physical integrity and it did not matter  that  he  would  not  be
      persecuted but was a factor that in the round had to be considered  in
      determining the  fifth  question  in  Razgar  namely  whether  it  was
      proportionate to require the Appellant to leave  the  United  Kingdom.
      Contrary to the ground, it is clear to me that the judge did  have  in
      mind the five stage test in Razgar.  Paragraph 24 clearly goes to that
      as does the use of the words "proportionate" and "disproportionate."

  22. I do not find anything perverse or irrational in the approach taken by
      the judge.  It is not for me  to  decide  whether  a  different  judge
      presented with the same facts would have come to a different view.   I
      find that the findings made by the judge were open to him.  Whether it
      is proportionate for someone  to  be  required  to  leave  the  United
      Kingdom is ultimately a finding of fact.   The  judge  did  take  into
      effect, in my judgment, the relevant factors and indeed all  of  those
      which were raised by Ms Fisher.  He took as  his  starting  point  the
      Immigration Rule and indeed contrary to what is submitted,  the  judge
      in fact did go to the wider aspect of Article 8  because  he  did  not
      simply stop at the Immigration Rule which the Appellant could not meet
      but rather considered the evidence that was before him.

  23. In all the circumstances I find that there is  no  material  error  of
      law.  It is established that there is  no  such  concept  as  a  "near
      miss."  The fact that the Appellant has lawfully been  in  the  United
      Kingdom for 9� years only assists insofar as it goes to the  issue  of
      proportionality.  As I have said the judge recognised  the  length  of
      time  that  the  Appellant  had  been  in  the  United   Kingdom   but
      nevertheless made findings that were open to him.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
