Representation
For the appellants: Mr R Khubber of  Counsel  instructed  by  Islington  Law
    Centre
For the respondent: Mr J Wright, Home Office Presenting Officer

     i) The case of Huang (HL) has not affected the need for  a  structured
        approach to Article 8. Subject to the need to  avoid  applying  too
        high a threshold to the issue of interference, and not  applying  a
        legal test of "truly exceptional", the five-stage approach set  out
        in Razgar (HL) remains correct.

    ii) The test or criterion of "insurmountable obstacles" remains part of
        UK and Strasbourg jurisprudence on Article 8. The fact that both UK
        and Strasbourg decisions sometimes formulate this test in terms  of
        "reasonableness" or "seriousness" shows  that  it  is  not  a  test
        subject to strict definition. Whichever of  these  formulations  is
        used, however, an  applicant  must  show  more  than  a  degree  of
        hardship.

   iii) If there are no insurmountable obstacles or serious difficulties in
        the way of family members accompanying an applicant abroad, special
        reasons need to be shown for why an adverse decision is not  to  be
        considered proportionate.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

     1. The first appellant is a national of Uganda. On  13  February  2002
        her asylum claim was refused but she was granted Exceptional  Leave
        to Remain (ELR) until 24 December 2002 to coincide  with  her  18th
        birthday. The second appellant is her daughter who was born in  the
        United Kingdom on  11  November  2004  (her  father  is  a  British
        citizen). On 11 May 2007 the respondent decided to refuse to  grant
        the first appellant further leave and to refuse to  vary  leave  to
        remain in the United Kingdom. The second appellant was  refused  on
        the same basis. In a determination notified on  18  September  2007
        Immigration Judge Bryant found that the  first  appellant  had  not
        given a credible account of her  past  experiences  in  Uganda  and
        dismissed both their appeals on asylum, humanitarian protection and
        Article 3 grounds. He also rejected  their  Article  8  grounds  of
        appeal.

     2. The grounds for review were limited to challenging the  immigration
        judge's decisions in relation to Article 8  ECHR.  The  immigration
        judge had accepted that the appellants had  a  private  and  family
        life in the United Kingdom but did not consider that their proposed
        removal (which  would  arise  in  consequence  of  the  immigration
        decisions made against them) would amount either to interference or
        to a disproportionate interference with the right  to  respect  for
        that family life.

     3. The grounds submitted that the immigration judge erred  in  several
        respects: (1) in finding that there was  no  interference;  (2)  by
        relying unduly in assessing the  issue  of  proportionality  on  an
        "obsolete" test of "insurmountable obstacles"; (3)  by  failing  to
        give proper weight to the  degree  of  disruption  the  appellants'
        removal would cause both to them  and  to  the  second  appellant's
        father; (4) by failing to consider and appreciate the relevance  of
        the  Home  Office  delay  in  making  a  decision;   and   (5)   in
        overemphasising the relevance of the first  appellant's  precarious
        immigration status  when  embarking  on  a  relationship  with  her
        British citizen partner.

     4. In his skeleton argument Mr Khubber contended, inter alia, that the
        appellants' submissions on Article 8(2) had  been  strengthened  by
        the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in AB (Jamaica) EWCA Civ
        1302, which concerned the threatened removal of a person who had  a
        settled British citizen husband. In  oral  submissions  Mr  Khubber
        contended that the effect of recent United Kingdom  and  Strasbourg
        case law on Article 8 was to  require  far  greater  weight  to  be
        placed on the notion of striking a fair balance and on  the  degree
        of disruption that a removal decision caused to a person's right to
        respect for family life.

     5. Contrastingly, Mr Wright asked us  to  find  that  the  immigration
        judge had properly applied the approach set out  by  the  House  of
        Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and Huang [2007]  UKHL  11.  He  had
        taken into account  all  relevant  family  details,  including  the
        social worker report. The position of the appellant's partner in AB
        (Jamaica) was significantly different from that of the  appellant's
        partner in the instant case.

   Our Decision

     6. We find that the immigration judge erred in law but that his  error
        was not material.

     7. We turn  to  the  first  ground  of  review,  which  was  that  the
        immigration judge erred in finding that the proposed removal of the
        two appellants would not amount  to  an  interference.  Mr  Khubber
        submitted that the immigration judge's approach to this  issue  ran
        contrary to the approach set out by Lord Bingham  in  Huang,  since
        elaborated in AG (Eritrea) [2007] EWCA Civ 801. In one respect this
        submission cannot be  right.  Confining  ourselves  purely  to  the
        immigration judge's wording of the test relating  to  interference,
        error is hard to find, since it was the same  as  that  adopted  by
        Lord Bingham in Razgar: at paragraph 90 (reiterating paragraph  88)
        the immigration judge specifically reminded himself that the second
        question which he had to ask was that posed by Lord Bingham, namely
        whether "the proposed interference by the respondent would not have
        consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation
        of Article 8". However, so far as concerns the immigration  judge's
        application of this test, we accept that he fell into precisely the
        type of error highlighted in AG (Eritrea),  KR (Iraq)  [2007]  EWCA
        Civ, and   KD  (Sri  Lanka)  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  1384,  in  that  he
        effectively applied a test of  "exceptionally  grave  interference"
        and so wrongly treated the threshold for the engagement of  Article
        8(1) as being especially high. In AG (Eritrea) the Court of  Appeal
        stated at para 28 that:


              "It follows, in our judgement,  that  while  an  interference
             with private or family life must be real if it  is  to  engage
             art 8(1), the threshold of engagement (the "minimum level") is
             not a specifically high one."


     8. In KR Sedley LJ stated:

             "...I agree nevertheless  with  Auld  LJ  that  the  essential
             change in our approach following Huang  will  be  that  rather
             than take the threshold of entry into Article 8(1) to be  some
             exceptionally grave interference with private or family  life,
             tribunals and courts will take the language of the article  at
             face value and  wherever  an  interference  of  the  kind  the
             article envisages  is  established,  consider  whether  it  is
             justified under Article 8(2)."


     9. We deduce that the immigration judge applied just such a test  from
        his  evident  unwillingness,  when   considering   the   issue   of
        interference to treat as of any  significance  the  fact  that  the
        first appellant had been in the United Kingdom since December 2001,
        had been granted (albeit only until her  18th  birthday)  ELR,  had
        commenced family life with a partner who was a British citizen  and
        had had a child with him. The immigration judge had regard to these
        factors  when  considering  proportionality  but   only   obliquely
        referred to them when considering  interference  and  its  gravity:
        indeed, at paragraph 89 he appeared to regard the above factors  as
        relevant (along with Home Office delay) only to whether they "might
        increase [her]  ability  to  demonstrate  family  or  private  life
        bringing her within Article 8(1)."

    10. However, as Mr Khubber conceded, this error could not in itself  be
        material, since the immigration judge went on to  make  alternative
        findings regarding proportionality and so assumed that Article 8(2)
        was engaged. Nonetheless, argued Mr Khubber, that  did  not  rescue
        matters, since the immigration judge's error of law in relation  to
        the issue of interference "contaminated" his findings under Article
        8(2) dealing with proportionality. He confirmed that  no  challenge
        was made to the immigration judge's assessment that the proposal to
        remove was "in accordance with the law" and  pursued  a  legitimate
        aim within the meaning of Article 8(2).

    11. So we must turn to examine the immigration judge's treatment of the
        issue of proportionality. One thing which  will  already  be  clear
        from our earlier references to post-Huang cases is that there is no
        question of Huang meaning that decision-makers  are  no  longer  to
        apply the same structured approach to Article 8 as before.  Subject
        to  the  clarification  that  (i)  to  establish  interference  the
        threshold is not an especially high one and (ii) that in  assessing
        proportionality there  is  no  legal  test  of  "truly  exceptional
        circumstances", Lord Bingham's five-stage set of questions  as  set
        out in Razgar remain the correct framework  for  making  structured
        decisions. That is made abundantly clear in  AG(Eritrea).  In  that
        schema the issue of proportionality under Article 8(2) arises under
        Lord Bingham's fifth question.

    12. In general terms we consider that the immigration judge's  approach
        to the balancing exercise under Article 8(2) was exemplary.  Having
        identified the relevant guidance of the higher courts in Huang  and
        in AG (Eritrea), he set out the factors, counting for  and  against
        the appellants which had particular relevance in this case. At para
        84 he did not find it proved "that there are indeed  insurmountable
        obstacles to the family, being the appellant, her daughter and  her
        partner, living  together in Uganda, even though this would  indeed
        involve a degree of hardship for some or all members of the family"
        and at para 92 he stated:

             "The  fifth  and  final  question  is  whether  the   proposed
             interference  by  the  respondent  is  proportionate  to   the
             legitimate aims of the respondent.  I  take  into  account  my
             findings under the Refugee Convention and Articles 2 and 3  of
             the Human Rights Convention; the length of time the  appellant
             has been in this country and the  length  of  her  partnership
             with Mr A; the age of the second  appellant,  M;  the  medical
             history of the appellant  and  her  miscarriage;  the  reports
             prepared by Dr Warren and Ms Finlayson; the  delay  there  has
             been  in  the  respondent  reaching  his   decision   on   the
             appellant's application; my finding that  I  do  not  find  it
             proved that there are insurmountable obstacles  to  the  whole
             family living together in Uganda; my finding that it would  be
             open to  the  appellant  to  make  an  application  for  entry
             clearance to enter the United Kingdom from Uganda; my  finding
             that the  appellant's  partner  was  aware  of  her  uncertain
             immigration  status   during   the   relationship;   and   the
             submissions made to me. I note the House of Lords judgement in
             Huang  [2007]  UKHL  11  and   that   where   the   issue   of
             proportionality is reached, the ultimate question  is  whether
             the  refusal  of  leave  of  leave  to  enter  or  remain,  in
             circumstances where the life of the family  cannot  reasonably
             be expected to be enjoyed  elsewhere,  prejudices  the  family
             life of the appellant in  a  manner  sufficiently  serious  to
             amount to a breach of  the  fundamental  rights  protected  by
             Article 8. I find that any removal of the appellants to Uganda
             would be proportionate and would be lawful. I find that  there
             are  no  substantial  grounds   for   believing   that   these
             appellants' rights and those of the appellant's partner, under
             Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention would be violated  on
             any removal of the appellants to Uganda."


    13. Notably Mr Khubber was not able to point to any significant  factor
        which this assessment overlooked. Furthermore, much of Mr Khubber's
        argument  amounted  to  no  more  than  a  disagreement  with   the
        immigration judge's assessment of the relative weight to  be  given
        to different factors. Contrary to what he sought to  assert  during
        oral submissions, we do not consider that mere disagreement  as  to
        the weight to be given  to  relevant  factors  can,  without  more,
        disclose errors of  law:  Braintree  District  Council  v  Alasdair
        Stuart Thompson [2005] EWCA Civ 178, para 19; Mukarkar [2006]  EWCA
        Civ 1045 paras  33,40.  But  it  remains  for  us  to  consider  Mr
        Khubber's specific points of challenge (points (2)-(4)).

   The "insurmountable obstacles" issue

    14. And so we move to the second ground of review. Here the crux of  Mr
        Khubber's submissions was that by applying to the appellants a test
        or criterion of "insurmountable obstacles", the  immigration  judge
        had misconstrued  both  United  Kingdom  case  law  and  Strasbourg
        jurisprudence. Whilst we think that Mr Khubber  put  his  arguments
        well, we find for a number of reasons that there  is  no  merit  in
        them.

    15. We should  note  at  the  outset  that  there  are  two  contextual
        difficulties  with  Mr  Khubber's  submissions  on  "insurmountable
        obstacles". First of all, it is clear that the immigration  judge's
        essential finding was that the appellants' removal would cause them
        no more than "a degree of hardship" see para  84.  So  even  if  Mr
        Khubber is right in  arguing  that  the  "test"  of  insurmountable
        obstacles which this immigration judge applied is too high  or  has
        effectively been lowered by recent case law, he did not  suggest  -
        and it cannot seriously be suggested - that the proper "test" is to
        be treated as satisfied by the existence of no more than  a  degree
        of hardship for those involved.

    16. Secondly, whatever the rights and wrongs of the  immigration  judge
        placing reliance on the concept of  insurmountable  obstacles,  the
        conclusions he reached in relation to Lord Bingham's fifth question
        (in Razgar) concerning proportionality were specifically reached by
        reference to the formulation given in Huang. To repeat the relevant
        part of para 92, he wrote:


             "I note the House of Lords judgment in Huang  and  that  where
             the issue of proportionality is reached, the ultimate question
             is whether the  refusal  of  leave  to  enter  or  remain,  in
             circumstances where the life of the family  cannot  reasonably
             be expected to be enjoyed  elsewhere,  prejudices  the  family
             life of the appellant in  a  manner  sufficiently  serious  to
             amount to a breach  of  the  fundamental  right  protected  by
             Article 8. In this present case, I have found  it  not  to  be
             proved that the life of the family  could  not  reasonably  be
             expected to be enjoyed in Uganda. Even so, I do  not  find  it
             proved that the respondent's decisions do prejudice the family
             life of the appellants in a  manner  sufficiently  serious  to
             amount to a breach of  the  fundamental  rights  protected  by
             Article 8. I find that any removal of the appellants to Uganda
             would be proportionate and would be lawful."


    17. But the Huang formulation makes  no  reference  to  "insurmountable
        obstacles".

   UK case law on the "insurmountable obstacles" test

    18. Our third reason for rejecting Mr Khubber's submissions  brings  us
        even more squarely to consider the  position  under  UK  case  law.
        Insofar as the  immigration  judge  did  rely  on  the  concept  of
        "insurmountable  obstacles"  when   assessing   the   question   of
        proportionality, we see no error on his part, since that "test" has
        been and remains an established part of United Kingdom case law. It
        was relied upon by the Court of Appeal in Mahmood [2001] 1 WLR  861
        following a careful examination by  the  Master  of  the  Rolls  of
        Strasbourg  jurisprudence  on  Article  8(2)  in  the  context   of
        expulsion cases. Mahmood  has  not  been  reversed  or  overturned;
        indeed it has been one of the cases on Article  8  most  frequently
        cited by the Court of Appeal and the Tribunal. It is binding on us.

    19. Mr Khubber submitted that in Huang the House of  Lords  effectively
        reversed or overturned or modified   Mahmood.  The  effect  of  the
        opinion  in  Huang  was,  he  said,  to  replace  the   "test"   of
        insurmountable obstacles with  a  less  stringent  "reasonableness"
        test. That submission has three difficulties.  One  is  that  their
        lordships said nothing  about  overturning  or  modifying  Mahmood.
        Bearing in mind that they reversed the Court of Appeal in Huang (in
        respect of its treatment of "exceptional circumstances" as a  legal
        test), it would seem odd, if their lordships thought  there  was  a
        further errant Court of Appeal dictum on the same  set  of  issues,
        that they should not at least comment upon it.  Another  difficulty
        is that the analysis  in  Huang  nowhere  identified  the  test  of
        "insurmountable obstacles" as flawed. The third difficulty will  be
        made clearer in a moment.

    20. As for  Mr Khubber's further  submission that even if Huang  itself
        did not (or did not on its own) displace Mahmood, subsequent (post-
        Huang) Court of Appeal authority has, we will leave that too to  be
        addressed below.

   Strasbourg jurisprudence

    21. Mr Khubber's parallel submission was that since by s.2 of the Human
        Rights Act 1998 the Tribunal and courts have a duty  to  take  into
        account Strasbourg case law, we should take cognisance of the  fact
        that the Strasbourg Court no  longer  approved  of  the  "test"  of
        insurmountable obstacles and in the Grand Chamber case  of  Uner  v
        Netherlands App.no.46410/99, 18 October 2006  [2007]  Imm  AR  303,
        [2007] INLR 273 had replaced it with a less stringent test. In Uner
        the test was not "insurmountable obstacles" but rather:
             " the seriousness of the difficulties which the spouse is
             likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant is
             to be expelled" (para 57)


    22.  Of  course,  Mr  Khubber's  argument  here,  if  correct,   causes
        difficulties for his own earlier submission that the proper test to
        be applied is that of "reasonableness" as set out  in  Huang  (HL).
        Uner does not refer as such to the test as a "reasonableness" test.
        That difficulty is not to be underestimated  because  of  the  very
        point Mr Khubber relied on elsewhere, namely  that  the  Tribunal's
        primary duty  is  to  apply  the  law  relating  to  Article  8  as
        established by the higher courts in the UK under the  Human  Rights
        Act.

    23. But leaving that difficulty to  one  side,  however,  Mr  Khubber's
        submission that the concept of "insurmountable obstacles"  suffered
        demise in the 2006 case of Uner, flies in the face of what we  know
        of Strasbourg case law post-Uner. That the "test" is alive and well
        is most obvious from one of the cases he  himself  cited:  that  of
        Konstatinov v Netherlands 16351/03, 26 April 2007, [2006] ECHR 336.
        The latter states at para 48:
             "...Article 8 does not entail a general obligation for a State
             to  respect  immigrants'  choice  of  the  country  of   their
             residence and to authorise family reunion  in  its  territory.
             Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life as well  as
             immigration, the extent of a State's obligations to  admit  to
             its territory relatives of persons residing  there  will  vary
             according to  the  particular  circumstances  of  the  persons
             involved and the general interest. Factors to  be  taken  into
             account in this context are the extent to which family life is
             effectively  ruptured,  the  extent  of  the   ties   in   the
             Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable  obstacles
             in the way of the family living in the country  of  origin  of
             one  or  more  of  them  and  whether  there  are  factors  of
             immigration control (for example, a  history  of  breaches  of
             immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in
             favour of exclusion. Another important consideration will also
             be whether family life was created at a time when the  persons
             involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them
             was such that the persistence of that family life  within  the
             host State would be precarious from the outset. The Court  has
             previously held that where this is the case it is likely  only
             to be in the most exceptional circumstances that  the  removal
             of the non-national family member will constitute a  violation
             of Article 8 (see Rodrigues da  Silva  and  Hoogkamer  v. the
             Netherlands, no. 50435/99, � 39, ECHR 2006 ..., with  further
             references)." (emphasis added)
    24. Mr Khubber's response to this difficulty when it was put to him was
        to say that the Chamber in Konstatinov was not a Grand Chamber  and
        that, in the event of conflict,  UK  courts  and  tribunals  should
        accord precedence to Grand Chamber judgements. Whilst  he  did  not
        help us with any authority for that view we  are  aware  that  such
        exists. In Al-Skeini and  others  [2007]  UKHL  26  Lord  Roger  of
        Earlsferry, having noted that not  all the judgments and  decisions
        of the European Court  speak with one voice, stated at para 68:
             "Faced with  these  conflicting  elements  in  the  case  law,
             national courts are justified in giving  pre-eminence  to  the
             decision of the Grand Chamber in Bankovic v Belgium (2001)  11
             BHRC 435..."
    25. But Mr Khubber's submission here begs the question of whether there
        is in fact conflict; to answer that we must look further.

    26. That leads us to pose two closely related questions  which  lie  at
        the heart of this litigation. What sort of  test  is  the  test  of
        "insurmountable obstacles" and what is its meaning? (For the moment
        it is convenient to refer to  it  as  a  "test"  but  that  too  is
        something needing further examination.)

   Meaning
    27. Mr Khubber's  submission  included  the  point  that  the  test  of
        "insurmountable obstacles" (even if it remains a UK and  Strasbourg
        test)  is  not  to  be  understood  as  a  necessary  condition  or
        prerequisite for being able to show  disproportionality.  We  agree
        with him on that.

    28. That it was  not  understood  as  a  necessary  condition  by  Lord
        Phillips of Worth Matravers MR in Mahmood is clear from  his  well-
        known summary at para 55 of that judgment:
             "55. From these decisions I have drawn the following
             conclusions as to the approach of the Commission and the
             European Court of Human Rights to the potential conflict
             between the respect for family life and the enforcement of
             immigration controls:
                   1) A State has a right under international law to control
                      the entry of non-nationals into its territory, subject
                      always to its treaty obligations.
                   2) Article 8 does not impose on a State any general
                      obligation to respect the choice of residence of a
                      married couple.
                   3) Removal or exclusion of one family member from a State
                      where other members of the family are lawfully
                      resident will not necessarily infringe Article 8
                      provided that there are no insurmountable obstacles to
                      the family living together in the country of origin of
                      the family member excluded, even where this involves a
                      degree of hardship for some or all members of the
                      family.
                   4) Article 8 is likely to be violated by the expulsion of
                      a member of a family that has been long established in
                      a State if the circumstances are such that it is not
                      reasonable to expect the other members of the family
                      to follow that member expelled.
                   5) Knowledge on the part of one spouse at the time of
                      marriage that rights of residence of the other were
                      precarious militates against a finding that an order
                      excluding the latter spouse violates Article 8.
                   6) Whether interference with family rights is justified
                      in the interests of controlling immigration will
                      depend on
                             i) the facts of the particular case and
                            ii) the circumstances prevailing in the State
                                whose action is impugned."
    29. The  language  here  is  clearly  not  intended  to  impose  strict
        preconditions  At  subparagraph  (3)  removal  is  said   to   "not
        necessarily infringe Article 8...provided that..."; at subparagraph
        (4) Article 8 is said  to  be  "likely  to  be  violated...if  ..."
        (emphasis added). Subparagraph (6) reinforces this  by  emphasising
        that the balancing exercise is very fact-specific. Further, if  one
        looks back  to  the  Strasbourg  cases  from  which  Lord  Phillips
        extracts the "insurmountable obstacles" criterion which forms  part
        of subparagraph 55(3), the case discussed  at  greatest  length  is
        that of Poku v United Kingdom (1996) 22 EHRR CD  94  in  which  the
        Commission prefaces its reference to the "insurmountable  obstacles
        criterion" with the cachet: "[w]hether removal or  exclusion  of  a
        family member from a Contracting State  is  incompatible  with  the
        requirements of Article 8 will depend on a number  of  factors...".
        None of the subsequent Court of Appeal cases applying Mahmood  have
        deviated from this approach: see e.g. Ekinci [2003] EWCA  Civ  765.
        UK decisions post-Huang case law have also continued  to  emphasise
        the need for specificity on the part of the fact-finding  tribunal:
        see e.g. AB (Jamaica), para 18.

    30.  Turning to Strasbourg cases, the approach taken by the  Commission
        in  Poku  continues  to  be  reflected   in   the   Court's   later
        jurisprudence. Thus in Uner such factors are variously described by
        the Grand  Chamber  as  "relevant  criteria",  (also  the  "Boultif
        criteria") "relevant considerations", "elements to  be  taken  into
        account" or considerations the Court "will have regard  to"  (paras
        66, 57, 58).

    31. The consistency with which the Court describes the  "insurmountable
        obstacles" test as a relevant criterion is enough to establish that
        it is a  factor  (Poku,  Uner)  or  criterion  (Uner)  or  "guiding
        principle" (Boultif v Switzerland, no.54273/00 para 46  ECHR  2001-
        IX) which the  decision-maker must or "should" take  into  account:
        see Uner, para 60. To that extent (but to that extent only) it  can
        be said to be a necessary requirement. But it is  never  said  that
        failure to  satisfy  this  /factor/criterion/principle  necessarily
        means that the adverse decision must be  proportionate.  Indeed  to
        elevate it into a necessary condition in that sense would undermine
        the Court's essential principle concerning the  need  to  strike  a
        fair balance between the applicant's rights and interests  and  the
        interests of the state or wider community. For then it could become
        a factor dispositive of an  application  irrespective  of  weighing
        other relevant considerations in the balance. Likewise the Tribunal
        (see, for example, Cafer Bakir [2002] UKIAT 01176)  and  the  Court
        have emphasised the need  for  fact-specific  application  of  such
        criteria in just as strong terms as used by the Master of the Rolls
        in para 55(6) of Mahmood.


    32.  Having  said  that,   consideration   of   whether   there   exist
        insurmountable obstacles  or  serious  difficulties  is  clearly  a
        guiding principle or criterion (or,  for  convenience,  "test")  of
        major importance to the proper conduct of the  balancing  exercise.
        That is because it reflects (and is a direct corollary of)  one  of
        the first principles upon which  all  Strasbourg  jurisprudence  on
        Article 8 in expulsion cases is based, namely that it is the  right
        of states to control exit and entry of foreign nationals and no-one
        has a right to choose in which country they reside or in which they
        conduct their private and family life. Thus at para 54 in Uner  the
        Court states:

             "The Court reaffirms at the outset that a State  is  entitled,
             as a matter of international law and  subject  to  its  treaty
             obligations, to control the entry of aliens into its territory
             and their residence there (see, among many other  authorities,
             Abdulaziz, Cabales  and  Balkandali  v.  the  United  Kingdom,
             judgment of 28 May 1985,  Series  A  no.  94,  p.  34,  �  67,
             Boujlifa v. France, judgment of 21 October  1997,  Reports  of
             Judgments  and  Decisions  1997 VI,  p.  2264,  �  42).  The
             Convention does not guarantee the right of an alien  to  enter
             or to reside in a particular country. "


    33. Similar formulations abound: to take two recent examples, see  e.g.
        Da Silva and Hoogkamer [2006] 1 FCR 229 ("... Article 8  does  not
        entail a general obligation for  a  State  to  respect  immigrants'
        choice of the country of their residence and  to  authorise  family
        reunion in its territory."(para 39); Konstatinov ("Article  8  does
        not entail a general obligation for a State to respect  immigrants'
        choice of the country of their residence and  to  authorise  family
        reunion in its territory" (para 38)).

    34. Again and again the Court has emphasised that an  applicant  cannot
        normally succeed if all he can show is that he or she would  prefer
        to conduct his family life in the host Member State. More  must  be
        shown  than  that  relocation  abroad  would  cause  difficulty  or
        hardship. Thus in Abdulaziz,Cabales and Balkandali v  UK  (1985)  7
        EHRR 471 the Court concluded that  the  applicants  had  not  shown
        "special reasons" why they  could  not  be  expected  to  establish
        family life in their own or their  husbands'  home  countries:  see
        para 68. To similar effect, in Headley v  UK  App.no.  39642/03  at
        Section C(2)(b) the Court stated:
             "Not least, the Court will also consider  the  seriousness  of
             the difficulties which  the  other  family  members  would  be
             likely to encounter in  the  applicant's  country  of  origin,
             although the mere  fact  that  a  person  might  face  certain
             difficulties in accompanying her or his family  member  cannot
             in itself preclude expulsion (Boultif, � 50)."
    35. If mere hardship or  difficulty  sufficed,  then  the  interference
        would not be capable of causing disproportionality since  it  would
        not threaten the essence or substance of the right protected.

   Wording
    36. Analysing the issue by reference  to  basic  Strasbourg  principles
        also helps resolve the  next  main  issue  concerning  the  correct
        wording of the test. For it shows that  in  both  UK  and  European
        Court decisions there is  no  adherence  to  a  strict  formula  or
        technical wording.

    37. The clearest evidence of this lies in  the  fact  that  even  on  a
        superficial survey one can  find  key  cases  which  use  different
        formulations  within  the  same  judgment.  In  Mahmood,   although
        subparagraph 55(3) refers to "insurmountable obstacles":
             "(3) ...provided that there are no insurmountable obstacles to
             the family living together in the country  of  origin  of  the
             family member excluded, even where this involves a  degree  of
             hardship for some or all members of the family."
         the next paragraph (still dealing with the same issue  but  in  the
         context of long-established family members) uses the terminology of
         "reasonableness":
             "(4) Article 8 is likely to be violated by the expulsion of  a
             member of a family that has been long established in  a  State
             if the circumstances are such that it  is  not  reasonable  to
             expect the other members of the family to follow  that  member
             expelled. "
    38. Earlier in the same judgment Laws LJ had seemingly treated the test
        as one of reasonableness: he stated at para 33 that the  respondent
        "...was entitled to conclude that it would be reasonable  for  her,
        and the children, to accompany [the appellant]  to  Pakistan".  The
        Master of the Rolls' earlier summary of cases at para 54 had stated
        the test as applied by the Court in Beljoudi as one  about  whether
        there existed "real practical or even legal obstacles in the way of
        [this man's] wife accompanying [him] to Algeria".

    39. As already touched on, the  House  of  Lords  in  Huang  (para  20)
        formulates the test in terms of reasonableness:


             " In an article 8 case where this question  is  reached,  the
             ultimate question for the appellate immigration  authority  is
             whether  the  refusal  of  leave  to  enter  or   remain,   in
             circumstances where the life of the family  cannot  reasonably
             be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking  full  account  of
             all  considerations  weighing  in  favour  of   the   refusal,
             prejudices the family  life  of  the  applicant  in  a  manner
             sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the  fundamental
             right protected by article 8. If the answer to  this  question
             is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the authority must
             so decide." (emphasis added)


    40. In post-Huang Court of Appeal cases, the reasonableness formulation
        has been repeated frequently, but in AB (Jamaica) Sedley LJ deploys
        a slightly different variant. At paras 18-19 he seeks  to  draw  on
        the criteria adopted by the House of Lords at  para  20  in  Januzi
        [2006] UKHL 5 in relation to the different question of  whether  an
        asylum-seeker can be expected to relocate in his or her country  of
        origin  (criteria  cast  in  terms  of  reasonableness  and   undue
        hardship). In a more recent case, AB (Democratic Republic of Congo)
        [2007] EWCA Civ 1422, the Court treated the relevant  criterion  as
        that of "insurmountable obstacles": see paras 20-21.


    41. Turning to Strasbourg jurisprudence one can see that  the  European
        Court too utilises more than one formulation, sometimes even within
        the same judgment. Thus in Keles v Germany App no. 32231/02 27  Oct
        2005 at para 57 the Court, having referred to Boultif v Switzerland
        (2001) 33 EHRR 50, no.54273/00 para 46 ECHR  2001-IX,  stated  that
        where an exclusion order is imposed on second generation immigrants
        who have started a family of their own in a Contracting State  "the
        Court applies the following guiding principles in  its  examination
        of the question of whether that order was necessary in a democratic
        society". One of the principles given in the list that  follows  is
        "the seriousness of the difficulties which the spouse is likely  to
        encounter in the applicant's country of origin". But when it  turns
        to this principle or factor at para 63, it states:
             "With regard to the question of whether the applicant's family
             could reasonably  be  expected  to  follow  the  applicant  to
             Turkey..."
    42. Ranging more widely, it can be seen that  the  Court  over  a  long
        period has employed principally three formulations:
             -an "insurmountable obstacles" wording:  "...whether there are
             insurmountable obstacles in the way of the  family  living  in
             the country of origin of one or more of  them"  (see  e.g.  Da
             Silva and Hoogkamer, para 39; Headley v UK App no. 39642/03  1
             March 2005; Konstatinov, paras 48,52);
             -a "reasonableness" wording: "...the question of  whether  the
             applicant's family could reasonably be expected to follow  the
             applicant to ..."(see e.g. Keles, para 63;   Uner,  para  64);
             and
             -  a  "seriousness"  wording:  " the  seriousness   of   the
             difficulties which the spouse is likely to  encounter  in  the
             country to which the applicant is to be expelled."  (see  e.g.
             Boultif, para 48 ,Uner, para 57, Keles, para 57).
    43.  What  the  above  analysis  shows  is  that  the   "insurmountable
        obstacles" test is not subject to strict  definition  but  is  used
        interchangeably with two other formulations.


    44. What conclusions are to be drawn? We think  there  are  principally
        two. Firstly, the range of expressions used  shows that it is wrong
        to treat the use of one formulation rather than another (out of the
        three) as proof that the judicial decision-maker is adopting less -
         or more - stringent criteria. The wording of each articulates  the
        same basic principle. Second, in both  UK and Strasbourg  case  law
        one can see that although the wording can vary, there is always the
        same  essential underpinning (or basic principle) that what must be
        shown is more than a mere  hardship  or  mere  difficulty  or  mere
        obstacle. There is a seriousness test which requires the  obstacles
        or difficulties to go beyond matters of choice or inconvenience.


    45. The answer to Mr Khubber's second ground is therefore that  neither
        UK nor Strasbourg case law is to be read  as  having  rejected  the
        "insurmountable obstacles" test or adopted less stringent criteria.
        By the same token, the fact that both UK and  Strasbourg  decisions
        adopt a  criterion  of  reasonableness  or  seriousness  (or  undue
        hardship) shows that it would be wrong to define the  test  as  one
        that requires in all cases difficulties that cannot of necessity be
        overcome or surmounted.

    46.  It is appropriate that we comment further on the  introduction  by
        Sedley LJ in AB (Jamaica) of a further variant  based  on  criteria
        relating to "undue hardship"/"reasonableness" applied by the  House
        of Lords in Januzi when giving guidance on the proper  approach  to
        cases of asylum seekers involving the issue of internal relocation.
        As a reminder of the need for  decision-makers  (when  considering,
        inter alia, the issue of the seriousness of the difficulties in the
        way of family member who are established  in  a  Contracting  State
        accompanying  an  applicant  abroad)  to  conduct  a   wide-ranging
        examination, it is indeed instructive.  However,  beyond  that,  we
        see a real danger of decision-makers muddling two distinct sets  of
        legal principles: refugee and asylum-related Article  3  principles
        and principles governing Article 8 expulsion case law. Any detailed
        recourse to the former is not easily reconcilable with the need for
        decision-makers to heed and apply the basic principles  of  UK  and
        Strasbourg jurisprudence on Article  8.  (We  will  have  cause  to
        address the case of AB (Jamaica) again below  in  relation  to  two
        other matters.)

    47. We turn to Mr Khubber's third ground of review which contends  that
        the immigration judge failed to give proper weight to  the  adverse
        impact on the first appellant's partner (and father of  her  child)
        of having to leave the United Kingdom in circumstances where he had
        established ties to  this  country  and  hardly  any  practical  or
        cultural links with Uganda. Mr Khubber considered  that  a  similar
        failure was found fatal by Sedley LJ in AB (Jamaica). This  failure
        went hand-in-hand, he said, with a failure to accord due weight  to
        the evidence from a  social  worker  that  removal  of  the  second
        appellant, a minor child, would not be in her best interests.

    48. Dealing  with  the  latter  point  first,  it  is  clear  that  the
        immigration judge took the social worker  report  by  Ms  Finlayson
        into account: see para 92 of the determination (already cited). And
        we see no error in the immigration judge  deciding  at  para  92  ,
        having considered her report  (as  well  as  that  prepared  by  Dr
        Warren) in the context of the evidence considered as a whole,  that
        it did not suffice to persuade him that the proposed removal of the
        appellants to Uganda was disproportionate. We particularly bear  in
        mind that the second appellant was  of  a  tender,  adaptable  age,
        which is a consideration which both  UK  and  Strasbourg  decisions
        have frequently seen as weakening a claim that the  best  interests
        of the child necessitated non-removal of a parent or parents.

    49. Turning back to Mr Khubber's principal argument, we would reiterate
        the point made earlier that it  does  not  seem  to  us  that  mere
        disagreement with the weight attached by an  immigration  judge  to
        such a factor can give rise (without more)  to  an  error  of  law.
        Additionally, we would  note  that  (in  assessing  the  degree  of
        disruption removal would cause this family) the  immigration  judge
        properly saw it as necessary to consider the  evidence  before  him
        objectively. In this regard whilst noting at para 84 what was  felt
        subjectively by the first appellant's partner (among others)  about
        the prospect of having to relocate abroad,  the  immigration  judge
        concluded that:

             "......I find the obstacles put  forward  by  the  appellant's
             partner to be largely unresearched. He says he fears there the
             health, culture, health  and  safety,  the  disease,  and  the
             people the appellant mixed with there. Some of  his  knowledge
             of East Africa is simply based upon what he has heard in a pub
             in Edmonton. He is unemployed and there is no medical evidence
             before me as to why he could  not  live  and  be  employed  in
             Uganda. I have not found it proved that it would be unsafe for
             the appellant in Uganda. I do not find it  proved  that  there
             are indeed insurmountable obstacles to the family,  being  the
             appellant, her daughter and her partner,  living  together  in
             Uganda, even though this would  indeed  involve  a  degree  of
             hardship for some or all members of the family".


    50. Earlier he had recorded this man's evidence that: he was born on 21
        August 1962 and when aged 3 had lived in the USA  before  going  to
        live in Nigeria between 1966 and February  1992,  when  his  family
        came back to the UK; that he does not speak the language in Uganda;
        and that he and his wife have many  friends  in  the  UK  and  have
        established their lives here together and would like to  see  their
        daughter grow up as a British child (paras  41-46,  54-64).   Hence
        only around 15 of his 45 years had been spent in the UK and he  had
        lived over 25 years in another African  country  (Nigeria).  As  we
        have already noted, the  immigration  judge  had  also  taken  into
        account, inter alia, the fact that the first appellant had been  in
        the United Kingdom since December 2001, had  been  granted  (albeit
        only until her 18th birthday) ELR, had commenced family  life  with
        her British citizen partner and had had a child with  him.  In  our
        judgement it was entirely open to the immigration judge,  on  these
        facts, and having made a detailed assessment, to view the degree of
        disruption as not being at more  than  the  level  of  hardship  or
        difficulty.

    51. We come next to Mr Khubber's fourth ground of review which  alleged
        a failure by the immigration judge to consider and  appreciate  the
        relevance of the delay in the Home Office making a decision in this
        case: some five years (the period between submission by  the  first
        appellant of an application for further leave to remain in December
        2002 and the eventual decision on 11 May 2007). Here we can  be  no
        less  brief.  The  immigration  judge  plainly  did  consider   the
        relevance of delay and it is clear from para 89 that he did  so  in
        accordance  with  Court  of  Appeal  guidance  as  set  out  in  HB
        (Ethiopia) [2006] EWCA Civ 1913. His finding was  that  "I  do  not
        find it proved that any delay there has  been  has  prejudiced  the
        appellant so as to have a substantial effect upon her claim."  That
        was clearly a finding which was consistent with case law (see  also
        KD (Sri Lanka) [2007] EWCA  Civ  1384)  and  open  to  him  on  the
        evidence.

    52. Mr Khubber's final ground of review was that the immigration  judge
        had erred by overemphasising the relevance of the first appellant's
        precarious immigration status when embarking on a relationship with
        her British  citizen  partner.  He  relied  in  particular  on  the
        decision of the Strasbourg Court in Da Silva and Hoogkamer [2006] 1
        FCR 229 which was said  to  state  that  there  should  not  be  an
        overemphasis on the immigration status of the applicant (  in  that
        case the mother of a young child who had  been  unlawfully  present
        throughout her stay).

    53. There is no challenge to the immigration judge's finding at para 92
        that the couple commenced their relationship (in June 2003) in  the
        knowledge  that  the  first  appellant's  immigration  status   was
        uncertain. With that in mind, we are bound to say that Mr Khubber's
        reliance on Da Silva and Hoogkamer is puzzling in two respects: one
        is that this  judgement  makes  use  of  the  very  "insurmountable
        obstacles" criterion which he had earlier asked us to treat  as  no
        longer correct; the other is that in it the Court went out  of  its
        way at para 39  to  describe  this  criterion  as  an  "  important
        consideration":

             "[a]nother important  consideration"  when  deciding  to  what
             extent removal will disrupt family life is "...whether  family
             life was created at a time  when  the  persons  involved  were
             aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that
             the persistence of the family life within the host state would
             from the outset be precarious. The Court has  previously  held
             that where this is the case it is  likely  only  in  the  most
             exceptional circumstances that the removal of the non-national
             family  member  will  constitute  a  violation  of  Article  8
             (Mitchell v the United Kingdom (dec.)  no,  40447/98,  24  Nov
             1998 and Ajayi and Others v  The  United  Kingdom  (dec.)  no.
             27663/95, 22 June 1999).


    54. Further (and simply highlighting  how  fact-specific  consideration
        has to be) the Court only decided (see para 43)  that  this  factor
        was not weighty in this  case  because  the  Dutch  Government  had
        itself indicated that :


             "...lawful  residence  in  the  Netherlands  would  have  been
             possible on the basis of the fact that the first applicant and
             Mr Hoogkamer had a lasting relationship between June 1994  and
             January 1997 (see paragraph 34). Although there  is  no  doubt
             that a serious reproach may be made of the  first  applicant's
             cavalier attitude to Dutch immigration rules, this case  falls
             to be distinguished from others in which the Court  considered
             that the persons concerned could not at  any  time  reasonably
             expect to be able to continue family life in the host  country
             (see, for example, Solomon v. the Netherlands, cited above)."


    55. Mr Khubber submitted that the factor of foreknowledge of  uncertain
        immigration status had been found by AB  (Jamaica)  not  to  matter
        when the family member established in the UK is a British  citizen.
        We agree with Mr Wright that the facts of  this  case  are  clearly
        distinguishable from those in AB (Jamaica). AB concerned a (British
        citizen) husband, not a (British citizen) boyfriend. AB concerned a
        husband (aged 44) who had not only been born  in  the  UK  but  had
        lived here all his life (para 10); it did not concern  someone  who
        had lived for around 25 years in  another  (African)  country,   as
        compared to 15 years in the UK. Additionally, one  factor  seen  to
        flaw the decisions of the Tribunal and the immigration judge in  AB
        was their "dismissive" treatment of the  burden  which  removal  of
        this man's wife and children would  place  on  him  (paras  20-22);
        whereas in this case the immigration judge considered that issue in
        detail. AB is also distinguishable on another ground. It  primarily
        concerned whether the immigration judge and Tribunal  had  properly
        considered the application of DP3/96. Under that policy enforcement
        action is not as a general rule normally to be initiated against  a
        person who has otherwise no right to remain under  the  Immigration
        Rules if he or she is married to a person settled  in  the  UK  and
        that marriage took place  at  lest  two  years  before  enforcement
        action was taken. One of the flaws identified by Sedley LJ at  para
        29 was expressly that of the immigration judge's:


              "failure to bring into the assessment of the  proportionality
             of removing the appellant the fact that  the  executive  as  a
             matter of policy does not regard an overstayer who is now in a
             qualifying marriage as ordinarily liable  to  removal  if  the
             settled spouse cannot reasonably be expected to go to..."


    56.  AB (Jamaica), that is to say, was a case founded in part upon what
        was contained in the respondent's  policy,  rather  than  a  simple
        application of the principles guiding the  assessment  of  a  claim
        under Article 8 itself. In this case there is no  question  of  any
        application of DP3/93: the first appellant is not an overstayer and
        the matter of enforcement action has yet to arise.


    57.  We conclude that Mr Khubber's fifth ground for review falls away.

    58. Even had we  been  prepared  to  accept  that  there  were  serious
        difficulties or insurmountable obstacles in the way  of  the  first
        appellants' husband accompanying her and the  second  appellant  to
        resume their family  life  in  Uganda,  we  would  still  not  have
        considered that the immigration judge materially erred in law.  His
        decision included a finding that "it would be open to the appellant
        to make an application for entry  clearance  to  enter  the  United
        Kingdom from Uganda": see para 92.  The grounds of review raised no
        particular challenge to this finding and did not submit that  there
        would  be  serious  difficulties  preventing  the  two   appellants
        applying for entry clearance from  Uganda  in  order  to  join  her
        partner as family members of an  unmarried  partner;  and,  to  the
        extent that reasons can be implied for challenging it, they are the
        same as those we have rejected earlier.

      Insurmountable obstacles in the context of a step-by-step approach  to
      Article 8


    59. Given the recent reminder by Sedley  LJ  in  AB  (Jamaica)  of  the
        importance of decision-makers making "a structured  decision"  when
        applying Article 8, it is important that  we  clarify  one  further
        issue that arose from Mr Khubber's submissions at the  hearing.  He
        argued that the immigration  judge  had  wrongly  made  use  of  an
        "insurmountable  obstacles"  criterion  both  at   Lord   Bingham's
        question 2 (interference stage)  and  question  5  (proportionality
        stage). Of course, we have earlier found that the immigration judge
        erred in law in his approach to the interference  question  because
        he imposed too high a threshold. But it is right that we  emphasise
        that we did not consider that his error here arose  from  the  mere
        taking into account of considerations relating to  whether  or  not
        there were insurmountable obstacles to the  family  resuming  their
        family life in Uganda.

    60. We accept that from our earlier analysis the test of insurmountable
        obstacles is principally - and is properly seen as - one  which  is
        applied in the context of assessing proportionality  under  Article
        8(2).

    61. We stress that because we have seen a number of  immigration  judge
        decisions  in  which  it  is  treated   as   primarily   (sometimes
        exclusively) a test relating  to  the  question  regarding  whether
        there is  interference  (or  whether  the  interference  has  grave
        consequences).  We  are  also  aware  that  one  leading  textbook,
        Macdonalds  Law  and  Practice  appears  to  espouse  just  such  a
        position. In its 5th edition, it is stated  at  para  8.58  (p.293)
        that:

             "In reading the case law here, it is, in our  view,  important
             to recognise that the discussion of  where  the  'family'  can
             reasonably be expected to reside is conducted in  relation  to
             whether or not there has been  an  interference  with  Article
             8(1) rights. It is only if such  interference  is  established
             that the Court or Tribunal needs to move on to the question of
             justification under Article 8(2)."


    62. We respectfully disagree. As we have seen, for the  European  Court
        this question is and has  always  been  a  "guiding  principle"  of
        considerable importance in addressing the Article 8(2) question  of
        whether the interference is necessary in a democratic  society  and
        so proportionate.

    63. But that is not to  say  this  principle  or  factor  is  not  also
        relevant when  examining  the  question  of  interference.  As  the
        Tribunal noted in   MM (Article  8  -  family  life  -  dependency)
        Zambia [2007] UKAIT 00040:


             "11. However, it does not follow that the assessment of family
             life which has to be made is one which freezes  the  situation
             in the present,  without  regard  to  the  past  and  probable
             future. The preliminary question of whether or not there is  a
             family or private  life  (or  both)  is  plainly  a  different
             question from those raised in Lord Bingham's  five  questions:
             one obvious difference is that its analysis does  not  involve
             any balancing exercise. However, at all stages of the  Article
             8 assessment -  when deciding whether  there  is  an  existing
             private or family life, when deciding   whether  any  existing
             private or family life  is  the  subject  of  an  interference
             having grave consequences (Lord Bingham's question 2) and when
             deciding whether any such interference is proportionate to the
             legitimate public end sought to be  achieved  (Lord  Bingham's
             question 5) - the approach followed by  the  Strasbourg  Court
             is to take account of a wide range of circumstances, including
             the applicant's previous personal and family circumstances and
             the likely developments  they  will  undergo  in  the  future:
             Marckx v Belgium, Berrehab v Netherlands (1988) 11  EHRR  322,
             Keegan v Ireland (1994) 18 EHRR 342.  That  too  must  be  our
             approach"

    64. Once it has been established that there  exists  a  private  and/or
        family life, the nature of  the  inquiry  is  always  holistic.  To
        suggest that the "insurmountable obstacles" test  or  criterion  is
        artificially split off,  so  as  to  arise  only  when  considering
        interference or only when considering disproportionality, would  be
        to ignore the Court's flexible and commonsense approach.

    65. Equally, however, it is relatively unusual for the Court to find in
        cases in which there is an established private and family  life  of
        any  strength  that  an  expulsion  measure  would  not  constitute
        interference.  Thus  in  Sezen  v  Netherlands  App.No.   50252/99,
        judgement of 31 January 2006, the Court noted:

             "The Court has previously held that  domestic  measures  which
             prevent family members  from  living  together  constitute  an
             interference with the right protected  by  Article  8  of  the
             Convention and that to split up a family is an interference of
             a very serious order  (see  Mehemi v. France  (no.  2),  no.
             53470/99, � 45, ECHR 2003-IV)."

    66. Bringing to bear this approach of the  Court  to  the  interference
        issue makes readily understandable also why the post-Huang UK  case
        law has emphasised that at Lord Bingham's  question  2  stage,  the
        threshold is not to be understood as an especially high one.


    67. Whilst, therefore, when considering the issue of whether  there  is
        interference, it is relevant to consider, among other factors,  the
        issue of obstacles or difficulties in the  way  of  family  members
        accompanying the applicant abroad, it will often be relatively easy
        to show a (sufficiently grave) interference,  at  least  where  the
        applicant has effective  family  ties  in  the  UK  which  will  be
        significantly disrupted by the proposed removal.

    68. We add one final comment on the observation made by Sedley LJ in AB
        (Jamaica) at para 31 that "...the obligation under art.8(2)  rested
        on the Home Secretary to show that it was proportionate  to  expect
        him  to  emigrate  to  Jamaica  if  he  wanted  to   preserve   his
        marriage...". As presently advised, we are not persuaded that  this
        paragraph furnishes authority for the proposition that  the  burden
        of proving that it would not  be  reasonable  to  expect  a  family
        member established in the UK to accompany an expellee abroad  rests
        with the respondent. That matter was not argued  in  AB  (Jamaica);
        rather the respondent simply accepted that  this  was  so  in  that
        case. Further, it is not clear that attaching burdens in  this  way
        is consistent with the approach of the Strasbourg Court. Indeed, to
        the extent that one can discern a placing of burdens in relation to
        this issue, it would seem that the Court either places  it  on  the
        appellant (see e.g. Abdulaziz, para 68) or  sees  it  as  a  shared
        burden depending on the nature of the evidence that is relevant. In
         Konstatinov one of the arguments raised by the applicant was  that
        her partner was stateless and might  be  denied  admission  to  her
        country of origin. In rejecting this argument the  Court  described
        that claim as "no more than conjecture" (para 52).

    69. We note further that in the case  of  AB  (Democratic  Republic  of
        Congo) [2007] EWCA Civ 1422,  which was decided after AB (Jamaica),
        Toulson LJ at para 21 was not prepared to treat the legal burden as
        being on the respondent even in a case concerning a spouse who  had
        established refugee status in the UK.

    70. For completeness we must record that Mr Khubber's  further  written
        submissions  made reference (in case we found a material  error  of
        law)  to  the  second  appellant  having   been   granted   British
        citizenship in November 2007 and the first appellant  now expecting
        her second child due to be born in May 2008. Her partner  was  also
        said to have obtained employment that started in January  2008  and
        the couple to be about to make an application for a certificate  of
        approval for  marriage.  However,  these  submissions  referred  to
        evidence and materials that were not before the  immigration  judge
        and, as Mr Khubber conceded, such matters are not relevant  to  our
        decision as to whether the immigration judge  materially  erred  in
        law. Whether, given we have found no material error  of  law,  such
        matters will lead the Secretary of State to review the  appellants'
        immigration position, is not a matter for us.

    71. For the above reasons we conclude that the  immigration  judge  did
        not materially err in law. His decision to dismiss the  appellants'
        appeals must stand.
