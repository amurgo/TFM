For the Appellant:     Mr S Bhanji (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Chana, promulgated on 29th January 2016, following a  hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on 10th December 2015.  In the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Respondent Secretary
    of State applied for, and was granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Nigeria,  who  was  born  on  1st
    August 1992.  He appealed against the decision of the Respondent  dated
    5th March 2015 refusing his application to vary his leave to remain  in
    the UK as the spouse of a person present and settled in the UK,  namely
    of Mrs Selam [U], pursuant to paragraph D-LTRP.1.3 and paragraph 276ADE
    of HC 395.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant entered the UK on 13th August 2010 with  entry  clearance
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student valid from 30th September 2012.  On  23rd
    December 2014, he submitted an application  based  on  his  family  and
    private life which was refused by the Respondent.  His claim  is  based
    upon a genuine and subsisting relationship with his partner, Mrs  Selam
    [U], who is in the UK and is a British citizen,  and  is  settled  with
    refugee status having been previously granted to her.

 4. The Appellant maintains that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life with a partner were he to be required  to  go  abroad  with
    her.  This is  because  his  wife  is  a  refugee  from  Eritrea.   The
    Appellant himself is from Nigeria.  His wife cannot be expected  to  go
    to Eritrea as she is a refugee, and she cannot be expected to  live  in
    Nigeria, especially given that his newly born son  has  been  diagnosed
    with a condition which requires correction such that there are  medical
    reasons for them to continue to live in the UK (see paragraph 12).

The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge observed that  the  Appellant  had  satisfied  the  financial
    requirements of ï¿½18,600 combined income (see paragraph 23).   She  went
    on to consider whether there were "insurmountable obstacles"  for  them
    to enjoy family life outside the UK.  Although the Respondent Secretary
    of  State  had  said  that  the  Appellant's  wife  could  live  in   a
    neighbouring country, this was not specified and the judge  found  that
    she obviously could not live in Eritrea  because  she  had  come  as  a
    refugee from that country.  The judge held that,

         "The Appellant, his spouse and their son are living in this country
         and to require them to leave and settle in Nigeria, a country where
         his Sponsor has no roots, will amount to insurmountable  obstacles.
         It is the duty of the United Kingdom to preserve  and  respect  the
         family life of refugees in this country" (paragraph 27).

    The judge went on to be more specific in the words that, "the Appellant
    cannot live in Eritrea with his  wife  and  his  wife  cannot  live  in
    Nigeria with the Appellant" (paragraph 28).





Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state  that  the  judge  failed  to  specify
    exactly why, being a national of another country, would amount to there
    being "insurmountable obstacles" to living in another country.

 7. On 27th June 2016, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 8. Ms Ahmad, appearing on behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State, had
    two  submissions.   First,  was  her  submission  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant's cross-appeal, which was made by way of a Rule 24  response.
    In this, the Appellant's legal Counsel had argued that the judge  ought
    to have allowed the appeal under Appendix FM without the need to go  on
    to consider EX.1 for the following reasons.  The Appellant was  married
    to a person with refugee leave; that person had independent earnings of
    her own (see paragraph 16), such that the pay slips and bank statements
    for the six months preceding the date of the  application  showed  that
    the financial requirements could  be  met;  and  the  English  language
    ability was proven (see paragraph  22).   In  these  circumstances  the
    "suitability"  and  "eligibility"  criteria  under  Appendix  FM   were
    satisfied.  The judge had simply no need to go on to consider EX.1.  Ms
    Ahmad, however, relied upon the decision in EG & NG  (Ethiopia)  [2013]
    UKUT 00143 which made it clear that a party that seeks to persuade  the
    Upper Tribunal to replace a decision of the First-tier Tribunal with  a
    decision that would make a material difference to one  of  the  parties
    needs permission to appeal.  The Upper  Tribunal  cannot  entertain  an
    application purporting to be made  under  Rule  24  for  permission  to
    appeal until the First-tier Tribunal has  been  asked  in  writing  for
    permission to appeal and has either refused it or declined to admit the
    application.  I find that this is indeed the case here and  the  cross-
    appeal cannot be properly argued, having been raised by way of  a  Rule
    24 response only.

 9. Second, Ms Ahmad argued that with respect to her own appeal against the
    decision, the judge had erred in relation to the conclusions  on  there
    being "insurmountable obstacles".  This is because if one has regard to
    the case of RG (Ethiopia) [2006] EWCA Civ 339, it  is  clear  that  the
    judge had failed to give "adequate reasons  for  those  findings"  (see
    paragraph 36).

10. As to what could amount to "insurmountable obstacles", Ms Ahmad  had  a
    third reason for appealing.  This lay in the recently decided  case  of
    Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440.  Here it was established that

         "The phrase 'insurmountable obstacles' imposes a high hurdle to  be
         overcome by an applicant for leave to remain under the Rules.   The
         test is significantly more demanding than a mere test of whether it
         would be reasonable to expect a couple  to  continue  their  family
         life outside the United Kingdom" (paragraph 21).

    Ms  Ahmad  submitted  that   the   judge   had   not   explained   what
    "insurmountable obstacles" the Appellant's wife would face if  she  had
    to live with the Appellant in Nigeria.

11. For his  part,  Mr  Bhanji  first  dealt  with  his  cross-appeal.   He
    submitted that the judge should have allowed the appeal under  Appendix
    FM without the need to go on to consider  EX.1  because  the  Appellant
    could satisfy the "suitability", the  "eligibility",  the  "financial",
    the "immigration" and the "English language requirements" tests,  which
    were all in his favour.  Indeed, the judge  had  been  examining  these
    very issues when considering the immigration appeals and  did  actually
    allow  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  without  specifying
    precisely  how.   She  pointedly  did  not  go  on  to   consider   the
    "exceptionality" route  when  she  made  her  findings.   Her  decision
    plainly went much further and essentially incorporated Appendix FM  and
    all the requirements therein.  The fact was that none  of  the  parties
    here were overstayers and the child was  a  British  citizen.   So  the
    judge could have allowed the appeal after considering the facts in  the
    round, under the Immigration Rules.  She did not even have to  consider
    Article 8.

No Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.  First, it is clear that the judge did have regard  to  the
    proper test to be applied with respect to  the  phrase  "insurmountable
    obstacles" as used in the Immigration Rules.  But this is  because  the
    judge sets it out in a separate paragraph (see paragraph 25) that  what
    this phrase amounts to is "any significant difficulties" such that they
    would "entail very serious hardship for the applicant or his  partner".
    The judge then went on to explain how the Appellant is "in  a  parental
    relationship with a child in the United Kingdom  and  therefore  he  is
    also captured by paragraph EX.1(a) of the Immigration Rules" (paragraph
    25).

13. The judge also refers to the fact  that  the  Appellant's  partner  had
    "experiences in Eritrea where the Respondent has accepted that she  was
    persecuted"  and  that  "it  is   entirely   understandable,   in   the
    circumstances, that you (sic) would not want to return  to  an  African
    country when she feels safe in the United Kingdom and it should not  be
    required of her" (paragraph 26).

14. Second, whereas my attention was drawn to the case of RG (Ethiopia) for
    the Rule that a decision maker must "give adequate  reasons  for  those
    findings" (paragraph 36), it is also clear from that case that,

         "While a decision must show to the losing party why he has lost, it
         most certainly need not deal with all the  evidence  placed  before
         the decision maker.  That must especially hold  good  when  one  is
         dealing with background material dealing  with  conditions  in  the
         country from which an asylum seeker has come" (paragraph 37).

15. On the facts of this case, it may well have been entirely different  if
    the Appellant's partner, a recognised refugee from Eritrea, had been  a
    person without any such status, or had been here unlawfully, but wished
    merely to remain here with her child in the United Kingdom.

16. However, the fact that  she  had  been  given  refugee  status  by  the
    Respondent Secretary of State gave her the  right  to  remain  in  this
    country and granted her status in the United Kingdom such that it was a
    matter that the judge could properly give consideration to.  Bearing in
    mind that the judge did have the stringency of the test with respect to
    "insurmountable obstacles" at the forefront of her mind, it  cannot  be
    said that the judge's decision in this regard was such that it amounted
    to one that no reasonable decision maker could come  to,  or  one  that
    amounted to a material error of law.

17. Irrationality is a high test  and  what  is  required  is  "perversity"
    before this Tribunal can upset the decision of a fact-finding  Tribunal
    below.  For all these reasons, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge is upheld.

Notice of Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an  error  of
    law.  The decision shall stand.

19. No anonymity direction is made.
