                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. On the 15th December 2009 a panel of what  is  now  the  First-tier
        Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as  'the  Panel')  promulgated  a
        determination in  which  they  allowed  the  appellants  appeal  on
        Humanitarian protection and Articles 3 and 8 ECHR  grounds  against
        the order for Mr Asghari's deportation from the United Kingdom made
        pursuant to section 32 (5) UK Borders Act 2007.


     2. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  which  was
        granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Ward on 12th January 2010. The case
        was listed for an Initial hearing to enable the Upper  Tribunal  to
        consider whether the determination should be set  aside  for  legal
        error and, if so, whether it can be remade  without  the  need  for
        further oral evidence. On 18th November 2010 Upper  Tribunal  Judge
        Waumsley heard submissions from Mr Macdonald and Mr Tufan on behalf
        of the Secretary of State. In a determination and reasons  document
        dated 18th July 2012 Judge  Waumsley  found  there  was  no  appeal
        before him by Mr Asghari against the  depravation  of  his  refugee
        status and that this was therefore not an issue before him. [5]. It
        is noted there  had  been  no  cross-appeal  by  the  appellant  in
        relation to  the  Panel's  disposal  of  his  asylum  appeal  which
        therefore remains  unchallenged.   In  relation  to  the  remaining
        issues Judge Waumsley found, having set aside the Panel's  decision
        on the humanitarian protection ground:

     26.  I  have  little  hesitation  in  concluding  that  the  appeal  on
humanitarian           protection grounds  should  be  dismissed.   I  reach
that conclusion for             two reasons. The first  is  that  I  am  not
persuaded that the appellant            has shown  there  would  be  a  real
risk that he would suffer serious            harm on return to  Afghanistan,
a country he left as a boy some 30           years ago.  In  so  concluding,
I have placed reliance on the current            country guidance  authority
relating to the issue in the form of the              determination of  this
Tribunal in AK (Article 15 (c)) Afghanistan CG            [2012] UKUT  00163
(IAC).

     27. My second reason is that I am  satisfied  that  this  appellant  is
properly                excluded  from  the  right  to  claim   humanitarian
protection because, as              his past conduct  clearly  shows,  there
are serious reasons for                 considering that  he  constitutes  a
danger to  the  community  or  to  the             security  of  the  United
Kingdom. His appeal on humanitarian                   protection grounds  is
therefore dismissed.

     28. Turning now to his appeal on human rights grounds under  Article  3
         of the Human Rights Convention, that  is  a  claim  which,  on  the
facts             of the appellant's case stands or  falls  with  his  claim
for humanitarian           protection. Although exclusions  from  the  right
to protection has no             relevance  to  a  claim  under  Article  3,
nevertheless for the reasons            which are set out above,  I  am  not
persuaded  that  the  appellant  has              shown   that   there   are
substantial grounds for believing that he would           be  at  real  risk
of being subjected to treatment prohibited by  Article  3             if  he
were  to  be  returned  to  Afghanistan.  His   appeal   under   Article   3
therefore also stands to be dismissed.


     3. In relation to the Article 8 ECHR issue Judge Waumsley found  there
        was insufficient evidence before him to enable  him  to  substitute
        his own decision on the Article 8  claim  and  so  he  limited  his
        intervention to setting aside the Panel's  decision  to  allow  the
        appeal under Article 8 and adjourned the hearing to enable  further
        evidence to be called and a conclusion  reached  in  light  of  the
        current position. It is for the purposes of this hearing  that  the
        matter comes before me.



Background


     4. The appellant was born on 17th January 1970 and is  a  national  of
        Afghanistan. It is said he is from a wealthy Shia family  who  were
        forced to flee Afghanistan.  A  letter  from  the  Office  for  the
        Representative in the  United  Kingdom  of  the  UNHCR,  dated  3rd
        December 1986, relating to a decision by the Home Office to  accept
        a named individual under the 'Ten or  More  Plan',  refers  to  the
        appellant's father. It is said he was  originally  a  merchant  who
        travelled to various European countries between 1964 and  1980.  On
        returning to Iran,  after  seeking  private  medical  treatment  in
        Germany, he discovered he would be in  danger  if  he  were  to  be
        returned to Afghanistan and so he and his family remained in  Iran,
        where he was recognised as a refugee  under  UNHCR's  mandate.  The
        family were eventually permitted to enter the  United  Kingdom  and
        their status transferred.


     5. On 15th July 1988 the appellant arrived in the  United  Kingdom  to
        join his family and on the 22nd August  1992  was  granted  refugee
        status too. He was granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  22nd
        August 1992 although an application for naturalisation as a British
        Citizen was refused on 25th February 2003,  on  the  basis  of  his
        convictions/character.


     6. In  1992  the  appellant  married  Simin  Zerabi.   They  have  two
        children, Zahira born on the 14th August 1994 and  Sayeed  born  on
        the 25th June 2001. They are now divorced.


     7. The appellant has two cautions for violent offences  on  11th  June
        1994 and 7th October 1997.


     8. On 9th December 1997 the appellant received a 12 month  conditional
        discharge at Barnett Magistrates Court  for  an  offence  of  using
        threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour with the  intent
        to cause fear or provocation of violence on 12th July 1997.


     9. On 11th November 1999 he was convicted  at  Birmingham  Magistrates
        Court of common assault on 11th October 1999 for which he was fined
        �100 and ordered to pay compensation to his victim  of  �50.00  and
        costs.


    10. On 18th July 2002, at Birmingham Crown Court, he was  convicted  of
        Affray on 29th October 2001  for  which  he  received  a  Community
        Rehabilitation Order of 12 months, a Community Punishment Order  of
        80 hours, and was ordered to pay costs.


    11. On 10th February 2004 the appellant  was  convicted  at  Birmingham
        Magistrates Court of Battery on 27th December 2003 for which he was
        sentenced to a Community Rehabilitation  Order  of  24  months  and
        ordered to attend programmes as directed, with  an  attendance  not
        exceeding 60 days, and ordered to pay compensation and costs.


    12.  On  22nd  August  2006  the  appellant  was  convicted   at   West
        Hertfordshire Magistrates Court of assault on a Constable  on  21st
        December 2005 for which he was imprisoned for eight weeks.


    13. On 6th November 2006 the appellant was convicted at St Albans Crown
        Court of grievous bodily harm on 2nd July 2006  for  which  he  was
        imprisoned for 32 months with an extension to his period of licence
        of 28 months.


    14. On 1st November 2007 the appellant was notified of his liability to
        be deported and  on  28th  November  2007  served  with  notice  of
        intention  to  exclude  him  from  refugee  protection  under   the
        provisions of section 72 Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
        2002. Following an interview with the appellant on 22nd August 2008
        he revealed he already had refugee status and so  on  22nd  October
        2008 the Secretary of State served him with notice of cessation  of
        such status.


    15. On 14th November 2008 notice of liability to automatic  deportation
        was served (section 32(5) UK Borders Act 2007) and  on  23rd  March
        2009 he was served  with  notice  of  detention  under  immigration
        powers. The deportation order was signed on the 24th March 2009. It
        was the appeal against that order which came before the  Panel  and
        thereafter Judge Waumsley.


    16. Notwithstanding the fact the appeal process against deportation was
        ongoing, on 17th July 2012 at St Albans Crown Court, the  appellant
        was convicted of sexual assault - intentionally touching a female -
        no penetration - on 25th April 2012 contrary to  section  3  Sexual
        Offences  Act  2003  for  which  he  was  sentenced  to   4   years
        imprisonment, an extension of his period of licence  of  six  years
        and was ordered to  be  the  subject  of  a  sex  offenders  notice
        indefinitely.


    17. He therefore has  two  cautions,  three  convictions  for  offences
        against the  person,  two  of  public  disorder,  one  relating  to
        police/courts/prisons and one sexual offence between  9th  December
        1997 and 17th July 2012.


    18. The conviction on 11th September 2006 was for  inflicting  grievous
        bodily harm on his former  wife.  In  her  sentencing  remarks  Her
        Honour Judge Catterson stated:




          You are 36 years of age now. You pleaded guilty on 11 September of
   this year at        the plea and case management hearing, that is to  say
   at the first opportunity, to          the offence of inflicting  grievous
   bodily harm contrary to section 20 of the               Offences  Against
   the Persons Act on your estranged wife Simin Zerabi (?).   That        is
   the second count of the indictment. The prosecution made  it  clear  that
   they       were content not to pursue Count 1 alleging false imprisonment
   to trial, it            having been made  clear  on  your  behalf  on  11
   September that your plea to  the        offence  of  inflicting  grievous
   bodily harm was on a  full  facts  basis,  as  disclosed          in  the
   complainant's video interviews with the police.  That has been  confirmed
     on your behalf by your learned counsel Mr Griffiths at  the  outset  of
   his            mitigation on your behalf last Thursday.


          This offence was committed by you on Sunday,  2nd  July.  You  and
   your wife of        12 years have been  estranged,  living  apart  for  a
   couple of years. Your children, a         girl of 11 and the boy of five,
   live with her. On the day in question  you  were          visiting  their
   home, having  been  permitted  to  stay  over,  but  separately.  In  the
   late afternoon you and your  wife  were  in  the  kitchen,  the  children
   playing in          the back garden. An argument  developed  between  you
   and your wife about           you  taking  your  daughter  to  town.  You
   persisted in doing karate type             movements  in  front  of  your
   wife, close enough to come into contact with her,      despite her making
   it  very  clear  that  she  wanted  you  to  stop.  When  she   then   to
   reinforce  her  objections  hit  your  hand  with  a  plastic  tray   you
   retaliated. There       was, it seems to me, a relatively brief  exchange
   of blows between you. You got         the better of her, since  you  were
   able to restrain her -- since you, as I say, were      able  to  restrain
   her by tying her hands and legs with a washing line which had        been
   left about the house, and  you  slapped  her  face  in  response  to  her
   screams.       However, you did not tie her up particularly  tightly  and
   her continued           screaming seems to have persuaded  you  to  untie
   her. Had matters  ended  there           the  incident  would  have  been
   relatively minor.


          You went upstairs to take a shower and a verbal argument continued
   between        the two of you and you spilt the water out, as she thought
   deliberately to              provoke her. In that you succeeded, for  she
   picked up a screwdriver, telling you      not to. When you got out of the
   shower you proceeded to hit her with the           screwdriver  and  with
   the handle and tube of a  vacuum  cleaner  kept  in  a            bedroom
   upstairs.  When she  escaped  downstairs  to  make  a  999  call  to  the
   police you broke the telephone. Once again you tied her hands  and  legs.
   She        was at pains in her videoed interview  a  few  days  later  to
   indicate that you did        not  tie  her  up  very  tightly  this  time
   either, but it  is  noteworthy  that  amongst  her           considerable
   injuries noted  by  the  casualty  doctor  that  night  was  bruising  of
   both wrists and  ankles.  Having  tied  her  up  this  second  time,  you
   continued to        hit her, trying to stifle her screams by gagging  her
   it seems with a sock stuffed          into her mouth and by slapping  her
   face.


          The first policeman on the scene in response to the abandoned  999
   call could          hear her screaming, but was at first unable  to  gain
   entry at the front door. He      found your five year old son in the back
   in some distress, apparently thinking         that  you  had  locked  the
   door, though in her interviews I note that your wife has         accepted
   locking the  doors,  seemingly  out  of  habit.  When  you  did  let  the
   policeman in at the front door your wife was to be  seen  on  the  stairs
   behind you          in a state of great distress and  as  was  discovered
   covered in bruises.  A pair of        socks was  found  tied  around  her
   neck.


          The full extent of  her  injuries  is  set  out  in  the  doctor's
   statement. She had           bruises to her  left  cheek  and  below  her
   right eye, on different parts of her back,         on her upper left  arm
   and, as I have said, on both her wrists and both her ankles           and
   both her elbows as well. In  addition,  she  had  a  one  centimetre  cut
   underneath her tongue.  Whilst at the hospital she  collapsed  and  blood
   was        found in her urine. Fortunately, as a CT  scan  showed,  there
   was no damage to        her kidneys, but she had fractures  on  her  left
   side through the transverse           processes  of  two  of  her  lumbar
   vertebrae.  He refers to those at page 2 in            medical  shorthand
   as L2 and L3.  They were, I think, wrongly opened to me as      fractures
   of the wrists .......  Your actions in doing so were as cowardly as  they
     were criminal.


    19. HHJ Catterson noted the appellant's  immigration  history  and  the
        fact the family fled their home in Afghanistan before the advancing
        Russian army to Iran and were later forced to flee from Iran  as  a
        result of the Iran/Iraq war. The appellant returned to  Afghanistan
        to marry after which his wife joined him in the United Kingdom.  It
        is noted that the appellant has a history of  depression  which  is
        likely to have been exasperated or caused by the fact  he  had  not
        worked for many years. It was accepted the appellant has no command
        of English and lived in circumstances that led him to  be  somewhat
        isolated and marginalised. He suffers a lack of  adequate  literacy
        and numeracy skills even in his first language.


    20. HHJ Catterson also noted the  appellant  has  a  not  insignificant
        history of offending and refers to the offending history I have set
        out above. The offence for which he  was  convicted  at  Birmingham
        Crown Court and made subject of a  community  rehabilitation  order
        for  12  months  and  ordered  to  undertake  80  hours   community
        punishment arose  when  he  took  exception  to  a  distant  female
        relative  marrying  an  English  man.  It  is  said  the  appellant
        telephoned the home of her parents making threats to the mother  to
        rape and kill her. He threatened to kill the  father  in  a  second
        telephone call taken by him and then went to their home threatening
        the parents once again to rape the mother and kill the father. When
        the daughter and her husband arrived he approached  them,  shouting
        threats and punched the young woman in the face and struck somebody
        with a stick. He was then restrained until the police arrived.


    21. HHJ Catterson notes that the second community rehabilitation  order
        imposed on 10th February 2004 for the offence of battery related to
        an incident in which during the course of an argument with his wife
        he threw a clock at her which missed her but struck their nine-year-
        old daughter.


    22. The offence of assaulting a police officer on  21st  December  2005
        occurred when he kicked the knee of a police officer who  had  been
        called to their house and who had arrested him.


    23. Later in her sentencing remarks [R's bundle C8]  HHJ  Catterson  is
        recorded as having stated:

         In my judgement  your  criminal  record  shows  not  simply  a  re-
occurrence of          violence, but an emerging pattern of  violence  in  a
domestic context when your          own perhaps rather  rigid  thinking,  or
at any rate when you are subject  to               challenge.  This  offence
represents a considerable escalation  in  the  seriousness  of          your
offending.

    24. Shortly thereafter it is stated:


          In my judgement there is a strong likelihood of  your  reoffending
   in domestic         circumstances where  you  feel  your  will  has  been
   thwarted or your status               undermined. To that extent I concur
   with the assessment in the pre-sentence        report  that  there  is  a
   medium to high risk of you being re-convicted.


          ...... I have reached the conclusion that there is here a real and
   substantial risk        that if and when you reoffend violently you  will
   once again cause really serious       harm. I judge the  risk  to  be  an
   important risk which it is not right to ignore. In          short I  have
   come in the end the clear view that it is a significant risk.


    25. As a result of the above an extended sentence was imposed.


    26. In her sentencing remarks HHJ Catterson noted  the  report  of  the
        psychiatrist tendered  on  the  appellant's  behalf  and  that  the
        appellant expressed to the psychiatrist feelings as to  the  effect
        on his honour of his current marital situation although it did  not
        appear to the Judge that the shame which that occasioned on him was
        matched by any genuine remorse for his own violent actions.  It was
        also found that his aspiration to live in the family home with  his
        wife and children were likely to be unrealistic  and  that  he  has
        limited insight and, as the psychiatrist noted,  difficulty  taking
        ownership of his aggressive actions.  The  sentencing  judge  noted
        characteristics including poor anger  management  and  self-control
        and that it was his behaviour  and  his  ability  or  otherwise  to
        control his  behaviour  in  what  may  be  volatile  and  emotional
        circumstances which concerned the court.


    27. What the above demonstrates is that although the appellant received
        an appropriate sentence for the offence for which he was convicted,
        with the additional safety net of an extended  licence  period,  it
        did not deal with the reasons why the appellant offended and proved
        not to be a sufficient deterrent to him, as a result of  which  the
        appellant found himself again before St Albans Crown Court on  17th
        July 2012 for sentencing in relation to the recent sexual offence.


    28. In his sentencing remarks His  Honour  Judge  Plumstead  noted  the
        appellant admitted an attack which involved running  into  a  young
        woman, 25 years of age,  in  the  evening  in  April  2012  on  his
        bicycle.  It is said that having collided with  her  the  appellant
        then "launched himself on her" kissing her touching her body  in  a
        sustained physical assault. His efforts were  concentrated  on  her
        breasts and her vagina.  She was terrified and screamed  for  help.
        Fortunately, help did arrive.


    29. HHJ Plumstead notes that, in short, the nightmare of any woman  who
        makes her way about the streets on her own,  or  the  nightmare  of
        anyone who cares for a woman who has to make  her  way  around  the
        streets alone, is a sudden violent and persistent  attack.   It  is
        also noted in  the  sentencing  remarks  that  the  nature  of  the
        attack's persistence is best summarised by the fact  the  appellant
        had to be physically removed from his attack upon this young  woman
        and that it took three or possibly four passers-by to turn him away
        from her. It  is  noted  one  of  those  passers-by  described  the
        victim's humiliation in a picturesque way, saying the appellant was
        doing to her what a dog does in humping the leg of an individual.


    30. It is noted in his favour  the  appellant  pleaded  guilty  at  the
        earliest opportunity but it is also noted he seems to  have  little
        understanding  of  what  he  has  done  or  possibly  a  degree  of
        minimisation and evasion for what he has done. It was not  accepted
        that the appellant had been given drugs which affected his  way  of
        thinking and although it was noted he  had  been  drinking  it  was
        found  drink  was  not  the  cause  of  what  had  happened  but  a
        disinhibiting factor.


    31. HHJ Plumstead too  noted  the  appellant  has  a  long  history  of
        repeated violent offending and that the violence, overall, has been
        escalating. It is noted that the last conviction for a  section  20
        offence on a guilty plea resulted in a very long sentence  but  one
        not surprising considering the fact of him having  bound  his  wife
        and then beaten her with a variety  of  makeshift  weapons.  It  is
        stated that has overtones of dangerousness about it.


    32. The sentencing judge found the author of  the  Pre-Sentence  Report
        correct in assessing the appellant as being somebody  who  poses  a
        higher risk of serious harm to adult females. The risk is likely to
        take the form of sexual assault by touching and rape.  It is stated
        in the sentencing remarks that the victim suffered serious harm and
        in the Judge's opinion the appellant is capable of worse.










    33. HHJ Plumstead, at page 4 para F, stated:




          In those circumstances I find him to be a  dangerous  offender.  I
   ask myself what         is the correct sentence, allowing for a  plea  of
   guilty in terms of a custodial            period. I have determined  that
   the custodial period in his case does exceed four      years.


          So, the sentence of the court is an extended sentence of ten years
                  imprisonment, being a four year custodial  period  with  a
   six-year extended       licence to follow. That  means  that  Mr  Asghari
   will be released after serving two        years, subject to  licence  not
   only until the end of his sentence of four  years,  but        six  years
   thereafter. I regard him as a real risk and until and unless he comes  to
     terms with whatever it is in him that drove him to  this  extraordinary
   and            violent attack, he will require  considerable  supervision
   and, as I say, represents        a danger.


    34. It was also noted that, in part, an underlying concern in  relation
        to the appellant's offending is a lack of understanding of what the
        proper normal relationship between men and women should be which is
        a concept he told the probation officer he did not understand.  The
        Judge stated that his past very  violent  behaviour  and  the  most
        recent violent sexual attack led him to conclude that  he  did  not
        understand how men and women should  behave  in  relation  to  each
        other.




Discussion



    35. Mr Macdonald raised the issue of Mr Asghari's status as  a  refugee
        but, as Judge Waumsley noted,  there  was  no  appeal  against  the
        Panel's decision in favour of the Secretary of State on this issue.
         Article 1C of the Refugee Convention sets out the circumstances in
        which the Refugee Convention will cease  to  apply  to  a  refugee.
        Under Article 1C(5) the Convention ceases to  apply  to  a  refugee
        where the circumstances  in  connection  with  which  he  has  been
        recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist although  there  is  a
        proviso where there are compelling  reasons,  arising  out  of  his
        previous  persecution,  for  refusing  to  avail  himself  of   the
        protection of his country. The Secretary of  State's  letter  dated
        22nd October 2008 explains why changes in Afghanistan  represent  a
        sufficient change of a significant and non temporary nature.  These
        are sustainable conclusions on the facts.


    36. This appeal is limited to considering Article 8 ECHR only as it has
        not been shown his is able to succeed under the Immigration Rules.


    37. The automatic deport order was made  after  Mr  Asghari's  grievous
        bodily harm (GBH) conviction but  before  the  conviction  for  the
        latest sexual offence.


    38. The UK Borders Act 2007 now mandates that in certain  circumstances
        the deportation of a foreign criminal is deemed to be conducive  to
        the public good and a deportation order should be made  in  respect
        of a foreign criminal. The provisions define a foreign criminal and
        section 32(4) then states that "deportation of a  foreign  criminal
        as defined is conducive to the  public  good".   The  Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department has a  duty  to  make  a  deportation
        order against a foreign criminal who does not fall into one of  the
        exceptions in section 33.  The exception in section 33 relied  upon
        by Mr Asghari is that which arises where deportation  would  breach
        the Refugee Convention or the ECHR.


    39.   In   Masih   (deportation   -    public    interest    -    basic
        principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT 00046(IAC)  the Tribunal said that
        so long as account is taken  of  the  following  basic  principles,
        there is at present no need for further citation  of  authority  on
        the public interest side of the balancing exercise.  The  following
        basic  principles  can  be  derived  from  the  present  case   law
        concerning the issue of the public  interest  in  relation  to  the
        deportation of foreign  criminals:  (i)  In  a  case  of  automatic
        deportation, full account  must  be  taken  of  the  strong  public
        interest  in  removing  foreign  citizens  convicted  of  serious
        offences, which lies not only in the prevention of further offences
        on the part of the individual concerned, but  in  deterring  others
        from committing them  in  the  first  place.  (ii)  Deportation  of
        foreign  criminals  expresses  society's  condemnation  of  serious
        criminal activity and promotes public confidence in  the  treatment
        of foreign citizens who have committed them. (iii)   The  starting-
        point for assessing the facts of the offence of which an individual
        has been committed, and their effect on others, and on  the  public
        as a whole, must be the view taken by the  sentencing  judge.  (iv)
        The appeal has to be dealt with on the basis of  the  situation  at
        the date of the hearing. (v) Full account should also be taken  of
        any developments since sentence was passed, for example the  result
        of any disciplinary adjudications in prison or  detention,  or  any
        OASys or licence report.


    40. I have referred to the two sets of sentencing remarks above as both
        offences were mentioned  during  the  course  of  the  hearing  and
        submissions made upon the same.  On  behalf  of  the  appellant  Mr
        Macdonald accepted the serious nature of his client's offending but
        submitted that his removal is not a proportionate response.


    41. On Mr  Asghari's  behalf  I  have  received  a  number  of  written
        statements and heard oral evidence  from  his  younger  brother  Dr
        Asghari. In his statement dated 21st March 2013 Dr  Asghari  stated
        three of his brothers live in the UK, including the appellant.   He
        states the appellant has lived in the UK for twenty five years  and
        never returned to Afghanistan during that time, although I note  he
        returned to marry  according  to  the  sentencing  remarks  of  HHJ
        Catterson - see para 19 above.


    42. Dr Asghari states they are from  a  very  old,  distinguished,  and
        wealthy  Shia  family  from  Kabul  where  they  owned  substantial
        property. It is said the family  were  targeted  by  fundamentalist
        Sunni's and non believers in the communist party. As a result, when
        the Russians invaded the country, they were forced to  flee.  After
        the fall of the communist regime they discovered  their  properties
        had been ransacked and their land seized and lost. Dr  Asghari  and
        another brother returned to Afghanistan in 2001 to see if  property
        could be salvaged but they were advised to leave as  they  were  in
        danger and so they left Afghanistan. In 2009  Dr  Asghari  returned
        but claims to have received a different threat in a phone call  and
        message as a result of which, within three days of his arrival,  he
        returned to the UK.


    43. Dr Asghari claims the appellant's position will be worse in that he
        will be recognised as a member of the family but have no protection
        and no means of exiting. He claims the Sunni will  revile  him  and
        there shall be no protection from the government. It is  also  said
        he is vulnerable with low self esteem and IQ without the ability to
        support himself and in need of constant support.


    44. Dr Asghari argues the appellant has established a life  in  the  UK
        and maintains indirect contact with his son. Dr Asghari  stated  he
        has provided his brother with emotional and financial  support  and
        that following his release from prison following the GBH conviction
        he was getting on well whilst staying with him and  his  family  in
        Poole, although he had to relocate to Hertfordshire where he became
        lonely and depressed and committed the sexual offence.


    45. Dr Asghari claims the appellant is remorseful and ashamed  of  what
        he did and claims he can be changed with the support  and  guidance
        he is able to give to his brother. Dr Asghari refers to support  he
        has provided such as funding the appellant's legal costs and in his
        oral evidence to spending around �100,000 to  date.  He  also  says
        that if the appellant is permitted to remain he will buy  a  family
        restaurant for him to run and keep busy under his supervision.


    46. It is not accepted by the Secretary of State that  Mr  Asghari  has
        family life recognised by Article 8 with his brother. In  the  case
        of Kugathas [2003] INLR 170 the Court of Appeal said that, in order
        to establish family life, it is necessary to show that there  is  a
        real committed or effective support  or  relationship  between  the
        family members and the normal emotional ties between a  mother  and
        an adult son would not, without more, be enough.


    47. In contrast, in AA v United Kingdom (Application no. 8000/08) ECtHR
        (Fourth Section) (October 2011), the  Tribunal  was  not  persuaded
        that the Applicant had a family life noting that he  was  an  adult
        and that his relationships with  family  were  not  exceptional  or
        beyond the norm.  The  ECtHR  held  that  Strasbourg  jurisprudence
        tended to suggest that the Applicant, a  young  adult  who  resided
        with his mother and had not yet founded a family of his own,  could
        be regarded as having "family life" for  the  purposes  of  Article
        8(1). However, it was not necessary to decide this.  As  Article  8
        protected the right to establish  and  develop  relationships  with
        other human beings and could embrace  aspects  of  an  individual's
        social identity, it had to be accepted that the totality of  social
        ties between settled migrants and the community in which they  were
        living constituted part of the concept of private life  within  the
        meaning of Article 8. In practice the factors to be  examined  when
        assessing proportionality of the deportation measure were the  same
        regardless of whether family or private life was engaged (paras  46
        - 49).


    48. Although the date of decision was some time ago in MM (Article 8  -
        family life - dependency) Zambia [2007] UKAIT  00040  the  Tribunal
        said that in the context of an in-country appeal, assessment of the
        facts relating to private and family life  within  the  meaning  of
        Article 8(1) of the ECHR has to be made as at the date of  hearing,
        not the date of decision. However, that assessment is one which has
        to be made in the round, taking account of past, present and likely
        future circumstances. The fact that an  appellant  is  economically
        dependent on adult children whilst  in  the  United  Kingdom  under
        immigration conditions  which  prevent  her  from  working  is  not
        determinative of the question of whether she is in  a  position  of
        real dependency.


    49. In Boultif v Switzerland [2001] ECHR 54273, as confirmed by Uner  v
        the Netherlands [2007] Imm AR 303, the Court said that in order  to
        assess whether an expulsion measure was necessary in  a  democratic
        society and  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  pursued,  the
        following criteria had to be considered.


          (i) The nature and the seriousness of the offence committed by the
      Appellant;
          (ii)     The length of the Appellant's stay in  the  country  from
      which he or she was       to be expelled;
          (iii)    The time that had elapsed since the offence was committed
      and the               claimant's conduct during that period.
          (iv)     The nationalities of the various parties concerned;
          (v) The Appellant's family situation, such as length  of  marriage
      and  other         factors  expressing  the   effectiveness   of   the
      Appellant's family life;
          (vi)     Whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time  he
      or she entered        into the family relationship;
          (vii)    Whether there are children in  the  marriage  and  if  so
      their ages;
          (viii)   The seriousness and the difficulties which the Spouse  is
      likely to             encounter in  the  country  of  the  Appellant's
      origin;
          (ix)     The best interests and well being of any children of  the
      Appellant;  and  in          particular   the   seriousness   of   any
      difficulties that they would  be  likely  to        encounter  in  the
      country to which the Appellant would be expelled;
          (x)     The solidity of social, cultural and family ties with  the
   host country and             with the country of destination.


    50. Looking at these issues individually in relation to Mr Asghari:


    51. The nature and the seriousness of the offence committed; Mr Asghari
        is the subject of the deportation order as a result of committing a
        very serious offence when he inflicted grievous  bodily  harm  upon
        his estranged wife in the manner outlined in the sentencing remarks
        of HHJ Catterson. The  sentence  imposed,  even  allowing  for  the
        discount given for his guilty plea, was a  very  long  sentence  as
        fact recognised by HHJ Plumstead; but  one  justified  in  all  the
        circumstances of the case.  It is also recorded that Mr Asghari has
        a number of previous convictions of a violent nature and  that  the
        recent offences represent an escalation in the seriousness  of  his
        offending.


     52. The length of Mr Asghari's stay in the country from which he or she
         is to be expelled;     It is accepted Mr Asghari has  been  in  the
         United Kingdom for over twenty five years and has formed a  private
         life here recognise by Article 8 ECHR.


     53. The time that had elapsed since the offence was  committed  and  Mr
         Asghari's conduct during that period: The GBH offence was committed
         on 2nd July 2006. He was sentenced on 6th November 2006 and at  the
         conclusion   of   his   sentence   released   under    supervision.
         Notwithstanding all that occurred, in December 2012 he committed  a
         serious sexual offence  for  which  he  has  been  sentenced  to  a
         substantial period of imprisonment.


     54. The nationalities of the various parties concerned; Mr  Asghari  is
         Afghan. There are no other relevant parties.


     55. Mr Asghari's family situation, such as length of marriage and other
         factors expressing the effectiveness of his family life; Mr Asghari
         was married and has children  but  there  is  no  evidence  of  any
         subsisting family life with his estranged wife in the UK,  who  was
         the victim of the GHB.  Zahira is aged 18 and an adult.  Sayeed  is
         twelve. Proceeds  were  commenced  in  the  Watford  Country  Court
         resulting in an indirect contact order. I  have  seen  evidence  of
         indirect contact through solicitors in the bundle and find that any
         family life with his children is limited to such contact; which  it
         has not been shown cannot be continued from aboard.  In relation to
         siblings in the UK,  I  find  it  has  not  been  proved  that  the
         necessary element of dependency exits  to  show  that  family  life
         recognised by Article 8 exits with them, including  Dr  Asghari.  I
         accept de facto family life exists and that the  brothers  form  an
         important part of each others private lives. There is no suggestion
         any other family member will have to leave the UK as  a  result  of
         this order and I proceed on this basis. I  accept  Dr  Asghari  has
         provided financial assistance and support but in relation  to  such
         financial assistance in JB (India) and Others v ECO [2009] EWCA Civ
         234 the Court of Appeal said that  financial  dependence  "to  some
         extent" on a parent did not demonstrate  the  existence  of  strong
         family ties between adult children and the parent  nor  did  weekly
         telephone calls evidence anything more  than  the  normal  ties  of
         affection between a parent and her adult children.


     56. Whether the spouse knew about the offence at the  time  he  or  she
         entered into the family relationship; This is not relevant to  this
         appeal.


     57. Whether there are children in the marriage and if  so  their  ages;
         See above.


     58. The seriousness and the difficulties which the Spouse is likely  to
         encounter in the country of the Appellant's  origin;  this  is  not
         relevant on the facts.


     59. The best interests and well being of any children of the Appellant;
         and in particular the seriousness of  any  difficulties  that  they
         would be likely to encounter in the country to which the  Appellant
         would be expelled; this  is  not  relevant  on  the  facts  as  the
         children are British Citizens who shall remain in the UK with their
         mother.


     60. The solidity of social, cultural and  family  ties  with  the  host
         country and with the country of  destination:  Mr  Ashgari  has  an
         established life in the UK and I accept the evidence  that  he  has
         very  little  relevant  experience  of   living   in   modern   day
         Afghanistan. In Maslov v Austria (Application 1638/03) ECtHR (First
         section) the Grand Chamber said that,  whilst  Article  8  did  not
         provide an absolute protection against expulsion for  any  category
         of alien, in cases involving  settled  migrants  who  had  lawfully
         spent all or a majority of their lives in  the  host  country  very
         serious reasons were required to justify expulsion. Notwithstanding
         this decision, time per se is not the determinative factor.  In  JO
         (Uganda) and JT (Ivory Coast) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 10  the  Court
         of Appeal said that in expulsion cases, whether the Appellant is to
         be deported on conducive grounds or removed as an  illegal  entrant
         or overstayer, good reasons will  be  needed  for  a  finding  that
         expulsion is proportionate when the Appellant  has  lived  in  this
         country since early childhood.  However, deportation cases  may  be
         easier to justify, insofar as the danger  to  society  posed  by  a
         criminal offending may attract greater  weight  than  the  need  to
         maintain effective immigration control.


     61. There are also a number of relevant  examples  where  the  European
         Court of Human Rights has accepted that, notwithstanding  the  fact
         an appellant has been in the host country for a considerable period
         of time, the nature of the offending means the decision  to  deport
         has been found to be proportionate. Such cases include Onur v.  the
         UK (Application no. 27319/07) ECtHR (Fourth Section) in which a  31
         year old Turkish Kurd had been in the UK with his family since 1989
         and had ILR.  In 1994 he started a six  year  relationship  with  a
         British citizen  during  which  time  he  was  convicted  on  seven
         occasions for a number of different offences including a conviction
         for aggravated burglary.  In 2000 he was sentenced to four and half
         years for robbery. Shortly afterwards, his partner,  from  whom  he
         had separated, gave birth to a daughter.   In  2005  the  applicant
         entered into a non-legally binding marriage by Kurdish rite with  a
         British citizen.  He and this partner have two children - one  born
         in 2007 and the other in 2008.  The applicant was informed in  2001
         that deportation was contemplated and in 2006 he was served with an
         undated Notice of Decision to Make a Deportation Order.  On  appeal
         he  submitted  a  report  prepared   by   a   consultant   clinical
         psychologist  who  diagnosed  him  as  having  mild   to   moderate
         depression, panic disorder,  mild  mental  retardation,  borderline
         intellectual functioning  and  dyslexia.  The  ECtHR  stated  that,
         although the majority of the applicant's criminal convictions  were
         at the less serious end of the spectrum of  criminal  activity  and
         were non-violent in nature, the Court could  not  ignore  the  more
         serious convictions for burglary and robbery. Although the majority
         of his offences were committed when he was  between  seventeen  and
         eighteen years old, he was in fact nineteen years old when  he  was
         last convicted of burglary and twenty-two years  old  when  he  was
         convicted   of   robbery.   The   case   was   therefore    readily
         distinguishable from Maslov.  The Court accepted that the applicant
         had spent a significant  amount  of  time  in  the  United  Kingdom
         although it could not be said that he spent the major part  of  his
         childhood or youth there. He did not return to  Turkey  during  the
         nineteen years he lived in the United Kingdom and although he spoke
         Turkish at the time of his removal from the United Kingdom,  he  no
         longer had any social, cultural or family ties to Turkey.  Although
         the Court did not wish to underestimate the practical  difficulties
         entailed for the applicant or his partner in relocating to  Turkey,
         no evidence had been adduced which would indicate that it would  be
         either impossible or exceptionally difficult for  them  to  do  so.
         Although the applicant was, prior to his deportation, diagnosed  as
         suffering from mild to moderate depression,  panic  disorder,  mild
         mental  retardation,  borderline   intellectual   functioning   and
         dyslexia, there was no  evidence  to  suggest  that  he  could  not
         receive treatment or counselling in Turkey should the  need  arise.
         The appeal was dismissed.


     62. In Grant v UK (Application No 10606/07) ECtHR (Fourth Section)  the
         Appellant arrived in the UK in 1974 to  join  his  mother;  he  had
         various children here; and he had been convicted  of  a  string  of
         offences.  The ECtHR upheld the  decision  to  deport  because  the
         sheer number of offences and the time span during which  they  were
         committed outweighed the fact that the offences could not  properly
         be described as serious criminal activity.  Moreover  the  claimant
         had continued to offend even after he had  been  warned  that  such
         behaviour would expose him to the risk of deportation.  Although he
         had been in the UK for 34 years it could not be overlooked that  he
         had never co-habited with any of his children; three of  them  were
         adults and not dependant on him; and his deportation would not have
         as a great an impact on his young daughter as it would have had  if
         he had been living with her.  He did  not  have  strong  social  or
         family ties with Jamaica but it could  not  be  said  that  he  had
         become so estranged from that country that he would  no  longer  be
         able to settle in Jamaica.  It was  also  relevant  that  he  could
         apply to have the deportation order revoked after 10 years.


    63. In Balogun  v  United  Kingdom  (Application  no.  60286/09)  ECtHR
        (Fourth Section) the Nigerian applicant had been in  the  UK  since
        the age of three. He was granted ILR following an application  made
        in 2003. In 2007 aged twenty he was  convicted  of  two  counts  of
        possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply for which he  was
        sentenced to three years' imprisonment. It was held the  nature  of
        the Applicant's offending and the fact that, with the exception  of
        one conviction, all of his offences appeared to have been committed
        when he was over the age of eighteen meant that his case  could  be
        clearly  distinguished  from  that  of  the  applicant  in  Maslov.
        Although he had been here since the  age  of  three  and  could  be
        considered a migrant who had  spent  virtually  the  whole  of  his
        childhood here and although he had not reoffended since his release
        from prison and deportation would have a very serious impact on his
        private life, given his repeated, drugs-related offending  and  the
        fact that the majority of his offending was committed when  he  was
        an adult there was no breach of Article 8.


    64. It is argued that Ms Asghari is unable to return to Afghanistan  as
        he will have no prospects there and be unable to find work and will
        be at risk. It was decided  Mr  Asghari  would  not  give  evidence
        before the Upper Tribunal and so I was unable to assess him  giving
        evidence, hear him express any feelings of remorse or  explain  his
        conduct, or see how the credibility of what was  being  said  about
        him stood up to cross-examination.


    65. I also formed the impression hearing Dr Asghari that his commitment
        to his brother is so great and the bond within this  family  is  so
        strong that care has to be taken in assessing the  plausibility  of
        his evidence in support of his brother.  I  gained  the  impression
        that what was being presented to me was a  scenario  calculated  to
        ensure maximum benefit to Mr Asghari in relation to his attempt  to
        remain in this country.  An example of this is the  claim  that  if
        returned Mr Asghari will be destitute. He may have  a  low  IQ  and
        personality issues but it has not been proved he will be unable  to
        work, even if at a menial level. An  unsigned  report  of  a  Zahir
        Moshini dated 3rd May 2009 refers to the  family  history  and  the
        donations made by Mr Asghari's father to their own  community.  The
        report states  the  family  are  well  known  and  loved  by  their
        community.


    66. A second report written by a Dr Shah [A's bundle - 154-162], on the
        issue of Shias  in  Afghanistan,  concluded  that  in  post-Taliban
        Afghanistan,  there  is  no  persistent  policy  or   practice   of
        persecuting Shias. They are reasonably safe in  their  strongholds,
        i.e. Hazarajat and Shia majority areas in Kabul city [para  1.4.3.1
        - page 159]. Kabul is said to be a relatively safe place  for  Shia
        in post -Taliban Afghanistan [para 1.4.3.2 - page 160]. Mr  Asghari
        is less likely to face the risk of being detained and subjected  to
        cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment because of his conviction in
        the UK and deportation [para 1.4.4 -  page  160].   As  a  minority
        ethnic group with a history of discrimination Shia are inclined  to
        help each other. Newcomers might get some help from the local  Shia
        community in places like Hazarajat. The economic situation  is  not
        encouraging and settling in Kabul will not  be  easy.  Settling  in
        Hazarajat would, however, be easier [para 1.5.4 - page 161].


    67. It has not been shown that Mr Asghari, who is from a  family  loved
        by the Shia community, would be unable to resettle  among  them  or
        seek suitable help and assistance if  required.  I  also  note  the
        evidence of Dr Asghari that he has to date paid in  the  region  of
        �100,000 to help his  brother  and  his  evidence  in  his  witness
        statement that if his brother was allowed to remain he will  buy  a
        restaurant  which Mr Asghari will run to keep him occupied.  If  he
        is willing to invest in a restaurant in the UK why will  such  help
        not be available to him in Afghanistan? When this question was  put
        to him Dr Asghari claimed that it was because he was  not  prepared
        to provide such support to his  brother  there.  This  created  the
        impression of evidence being tailored to suit the  desired  aim  of
        preventing Mr Asghari's removal by creating a  favourable  economic
        future in the UK but no such future in Afghanistan.  I  accept  how
        Dr Asghari spends his money is a matter for him but he acknowledged
        that his faith is important to him and yet claims he is willing  to
        abandon his brother if he is returned. Whilst that on the  face  of
        it, in light of the  strength  of  feelings  expressed  within  the
        family, the past  evidence  of  considerable  financial  and  other
        support,  and  his  religious  and   personal   conscious,   sounds
        implausible; if such help is not forthcoming that does  not  change
        the fact that although it will be difficult for Mr Asghari  to  re-
        adjust to life  in  Afghanistan,  it  has  not  been  shown  to  be
        impossible or result in treatment of sufficient severity to  engage
        Article 3 ECHR.


    68. Dr Asghari also spoke at length when giving  his  evidence  of  the
        risk to the appellant  in  handling  money  and  if  receiving  and
        collecting remittances. Sending remittances  to  Afghanistan  is  a
        common practice by those abroad to assist families and there is  an
        established banking /money transfer system in place  to  facilitate
        the same.  If Dr Asghari has no intention of sending  any  form  of
        help this appears an academic issue but, as  he  raised  it  as  an
        issue, I have considered it.  There in no country evidence  showing
        an enhanced risk to those who collect remittances.  It has not been
        shown that Mr Asghari lacks the necessary  skills  to  collect  and
        manage his money or to purchase basic necessities. The  ability  to
        survive is not dependant upon a level of  IQ  and  Mr  Asghari  has
        lived away from his brother for  some  time  in  the  past  without
        evidence of destitution.


    69. Dr Ashgari also spoke of difficulties faced  when  he  returned  to
        Afghanistan to retrieve the family  land  but  Mr  Asghari  is  not
        returning for this purpose and it has not been proved his  presence
        per se will result in such a view  being  imputed  to  him  in  the
        absence of steps being taken by him to retrieve  the  land  or  any
        resultant 'real risk' sufficient to  entitle  him  to  a  grant  of
        international protection.


    70. In addition I note there appears to have been little work  done  to
        analyse the cause of the appellants violent offending which may  be
        indicative of a  flaw  in  his  personality/psychological  make  up
        rather than any form of mental illness. There are  no  up  to  date
        expert reports from  an  expert  in  the  field  of  violent/sexual
        offending to assist the Tribunal in understanding why following his
        release from prison and intensive supervision and  assistance  from
        his brother after his GBH conviction,  he  launched  himself  on  a
        young woman in an unprovoked and violent attack of a sexual  nature
        as described above. There is nothing in the  evidence  to  give  me
        confidence that the reason why he behaves as he does and has for  a
        number of years is fully understood by his family.   The  fact  the
        appellant is in denial is a further cause for concern  in  relation
        to the prospects of further offending in the future.


    71. I have  noted  HHJ  Catterson's  observations  on  the  psychiatric
        evidence presented to the Crown  Court  as  part  of  Mr  Asghari's
        mitigation in connection with the GBH offence and a report  written
        by a Dr Abou-El-Fadi dated  21st  July  2009.  Dr  Abou-El-Fadi  is
        stated to be  a  Consultant  Psychiatrist  who  was  instructed  to
        prepare a report for the First-tier Tribunal hearing.


    72. At paragraph 13 of the report [A's appeal bundle page  166]  it  is
        noted  that  following  the  assault  that  resulted  in  the   GBH
        conviction Mr Asghari's wife was found to have  sustained  internal
        organ damage - probably damage to her kidney and vertebral column.

    73. Mr Asghari was assessed as being of limited and probably borderline
        intelligence. The comment in paragraph 27 of the report [A's bundle
        - p169]  that Mr Asghari's failure to  apply  for  citizenship  was
        probably as a result of his limited ability to manage  his  affairs
        is factually incorrect as he did apply but was refused as a  result
        of his character/convictions - see para 5 above. In paragraph 28 it
        is said Mr Asghari's limited intelligence has  predisposed  him  to
        act in a volatile and irrational way.


    74. In paragraph 32 [A's bundle - page 170] it is said the risk of  re-
        offending should be significantly curtailed if he were  to  receive
        ongoing  psychiatric  treatment  with  the   proviso   of   obeying
        conditions imposed by the judge not to have contact with his  wife.
        Such treatment is said in paragraph 33 to include the  prescription
        of a suitable tranquiliser and anti-depressant and psychotherapy to
        enable him to manage his anger and, if maintained over a reasonable
        period, should enable him to have safe contact with  his  wife  and
        children.


    75. The report also refers to the risk of deportation and mentions  the
        risk of self harm which has not been raised as an issue  before  me
        and which is not analyzed in the report. In any event treatment for
        any mental health issues will be available in the UK,  in  transit,
        and has not been shown not to be available  in  Afghanistan,  which
        will enable any risk to be managed. Treatment in  Afghanistan  will
        enable him to deal with the issues raised in the report  there.  He
        does not need to remain in  the  UK  for  this  purpose.  The  high
        threshold set out in N  and  related  mental  health  case  law  in
        relation to Articles 3 and 8 based upon this  issue  has  not  been
        shown to be met.   There is also no addendum following  the  sexual
        offence which was committed outside the familial scope  the  author
        of the report refers to and with no element of provocation.

    76. The facts of the  case  clearly  show  Mr  Asghari  has  a  serious
        personality problem which has  led  him  to  acts  of  unacceptable
        violence in the past. He was first cautioned at the age  of  twenty
        four  and  so  all  offending  has  been  as  an  adult  -   Maslov
        distinguished.  Mr Asghari has been assessed as presenting  a  high
        risk to the public and I find this to have been proved  to  be  the
        case by the commission of his latest  offence  which  represents  a
        further escalation in his violent criminal conduct.   I accept this
        brother loves him and wants to do all he can for him but the  offer
        of help in the future and his  proposal  is,  I  find,  based  upon
        family loyalty and not reality.  Dr Asghari accepted  in  his  oral
        evidence that his witness statement offering help was made when  he
        was unaware of the true nature of the recent  offence  although  he
        stated now he was aware it made no difference to  his  offer.  When
        asked by me whether the appellant has explained to him what he  did
        and why, he recounted a version very different  from  that  in  the
        sentencing  remarks  which  I   find   is   further   evidence   of
        minimisation,  lack  of  acceptance  of  blame/responsibility,  and
        perhaps deceit in not admitting the truth.  Dr Asghari had not even
        checked if his brother would be permitted  to  live  in  his  house
        where he has a female partner and young daughter.  They too  appear
        to have been unaware of all the facts  when  they  made  statements
        supporting Mr Asghari's return and neither did they attend court to
        give oral evidence. I can place little weight on offers of help and
        assistance in a case involving a  convicted  sexual  offender  when
        those offering the help are unaware of the full facts of  the  case
        and the real issues of concern, including a real  risk  of  further
        sexual offences which may include rape.


    77. There is no expert evidence from a person with  expertise  in  this
        field  showing  there  are  realistic  prospects  of  a  successful
        rehabilitation such that the risk of re-offending can be  found  to
        have been reduced. Dr Asghari's belief in the power of  the  family
        and Islam is commendable but not evidentially  sufficient.   If  Mr
        Asghari is unable to live with his brother he  will  have  to  live
        nearby. This raises the question of where he will be  permitted  to
        live as he is on the sex  offenders  register  and  what  level  of
        supervision is available. Dr Asghari and his partner both  work  in
        their dental practice and are successful because of the work  ethic
        he has. He cannot maintain this  and  supervise  his  brother.   He
        claims other family members will help  but  no  oral  evidence  was
        given from them, notwithstanding their presence in court.


    78. I also note Dr Asghari's claim that when his brother lived with him
        in Poole, and until he went to Hertfordshire, he was supervised  by
        him. I have also seen a letter from the Probation Service dated 9th
        December 2009  regarding  the   level  of  supervision  Mr  Asghari
        received yet, despite such input, he re-offended in a more  violent
        and perverse way.


    79. The two more recent and serious crimes are crimes that  cause  much
        revulsion and  in  these  circumstances,  only  the  most  pressing
        compassionate circumstances could outweigh the need to  remove.  No
        such circumstances have been proved in this case. There is  a  very
        strong argument  that  the  deterrent  effect  is  of  considerable
        importance in relation to the GBH which has a domestic element,  in
        relation to the unacceptable perception in  some  communities  that
        their honour and status and or position in a marriage entitles them
        to resort to violence against their  spouses  or  partner,  and  in
        relation to the need to deter potential sexual offenders.


    80. I find the Secretary of State has discharged the  burden  of  proof
        upon her to the required standard to  show  that  the  decision  to
        deport the appellant is proportionate  when  all  relevant  factors
        have been given the most anxious scrutiny required in an appeal  of
        this nature. The exclusion to be found in section 33 UKBA 2007  has
        not been made out. The appeal is dismissed.


Decision

    81. The First-tier Tribunal panel have been found  to  have  materially
        erred in law. Their determination has been set aside. I remake  the
        decision as follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    82. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.
