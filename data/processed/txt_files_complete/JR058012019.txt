                                                                  Respondent


                     Before Upper Tribunal Judge Frances




            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives,  Mr  S  Karim,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  JS
Solicitors, on  behalf  of  the  Applicant  and,  Mr  Z  Malik  of  Counsel,
instructed by the Government Legal Department, on behalf of the  Respondent,
at a remote hearing at Field House, London on 6 July  2020  which  has  been
consented to by the parties.

The form of the remote hearing was video by Skype. A face  to  face  hearing
was not held because  it  was  not  practicable  and  all  issues  could  be
determined in a remote hearing.

The documents that I was referred  to  are  in  bundle  of  155  pages,  the
contents of which I have recorded. The order made is described  at  the  end
of these reasons.


                                  JUDGMENT

   1. The applicant challenges the respondent's  decision  of  3  July  2019
      refusing  her  application  for  entry   clearance   as   a   Tier   1
      (Entrepreneur) migrant and the administrative review  decision  of  20
      August 2019 maintaining the decision. Her husband is her dependant.


   2. The applicant is a citizen of Thailand. She owns two Thai  restaurants
      in Thailand and has visited the  UK  on  several  occasions.  She  has
      invested �280,000 in an India restaurant in Leicester.  She  plans  to
      expand the business by adding Thai cuisine to the menu.

   3. The applicant applied for entry clearance on 15 April 2019. At  6.51pm
      on 4 June 2019 she received an invitation to attend an interview on  6
      June 2019 at 1.30pm. In her application form, the applicant  requested
      that the interview be conducted in English. The applicant states  that
      she was unable to prepare for the interview because when she  received
      the invitation she was six hours away from her home and  had  to  rush
      back.

   4. The applicant was interviewed at 1.15pm on 6 June 2019 in Bangkok.  At
      the end of the interview the interviewing officer  noted:  "Applicants
      English was very poor & had difficulty with the questions also  seemed
      to know very little about the finances of the company etc".

   5. The application for entry clearance was refused on 3 July 2019 on  the
      grounds the applicant's account in interview was not credible and  she
      was not a genuine entrepreneur.  The  reasons  can  be  summarised  as
      follows:
        a.  The  Applicant's  response  to  whether  she  considered  other
           locations to Leicester  was  contradictory  which  lead  to  the
           conclusion that the applicant had not carried out the  necessary
           research into her location;
        b. She was unable to state what salary she would receive which lead
           to further doubts about her intentions;
        c. She did not know how the funds would be invested,  although  she
           was able to estimate the costs;
        d.   Although  the  applicant  stated  she  had  seen  the  company
           accounts, she was unable to name the accounting company and  she
           did not know the company's gross or  net  profit  for  the  last
           financial year or future turnover.

   6. The applicant applied for administrative review on  the  grounds  that
      she did not have time to prepare for the interview and to  bring  with
      her  relevant  information  in  relation  to  the  business.  She  was
      investing in an existing business in Leicester and therefore  research
      into alternative locations was not necessary. The Applicant was  self-
      sufficient and would not be reliant on a salary from the business.  It
      was unfair for the respondent to refuse the application on  the  basis
      that the applicant was unable to answer a few  questions  because  she
      could not recall the relevant information at the time.

The Applicant's grounds and submissions
   7. The grounds submit that the interview process was procedurally  unfair
      and the respondent's conclusion that the applicant was not  a  genuine
      entrepreneur was irrational. The grounds argue that the applicant  was
      given short notice of the interview and there was no  attempt  to  re-
      phrase questions which the applicant did not understand. The applicant
      stated she had understood 80% of the questions and she was  not  given
      the opportunity to address the  respondent's  concerns  (Balajigari  v
      SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673). The reasons in the refusal decision did not
      reflect the  answers  given  in  interview.  The  applicant  was  only
      considering investing in a business in Leicester and she was  able  to
      give an estimated figure for her  salary.  The  respondent  relied  on
      irrelevant matters disclosed in interview and failed to consider other
      material factors.

   8. Mr Karim relied on his skeleton argument and  submitted  the  decision
      making process was procedurally unfair because the applicant  did  not
      have a fair opportunity to respond to potentially adverse  matters:  R
      (Mustaq) v ECO [2015] UKUT 224. It was clear at the  early  stages  of
      the interview that she had  difficulties  understanding  and  fairness
      demanded an assessment of whether  the  interview  could  continue  in
      English. The respondent failed to consider the applicant's ability  to
      properly express herself in English and, once it became  apparent  the
      applicant was having clear difficulties in  understanding,  procedural
      fairness dictated that a further interview or opportunity ought to  be
      given. The relevant clarification and necessary probing did not exist:
      R (Anjum) v ECO [2017] UKUT 00406 (IAC). It was unfair to rely on  the
      interview to reach adverse conclusions. The applicant was not given  a
      fair opportunity to answer questions in interview because of her  lack
      of ability to understand English.




   9. Mr Karim submitted the respondent's conclusion that the funds were not
      genuinely  available  to  the  applicant  was  irrational  given   the
      extensive evidence that the funds had already  been  transferred  from
      the applicant to the business, that she had a 50% share in the company
      and  she  was  appointed  a  director.  The  respondent's  credibility
      concerns were out with the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  and
      inconsistent with the points awarded for access  and  availability  of
      funds. The applicant had satisfied all the other requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules and the respondent  could  not  impose  requirements
      outside the parameters of 245DB (f) and (h).

  10. The respondent's concerns about the  location  of  the  business  were
      irrational  because  the  business  already  exists  and  is  running.
      Leicester was chosen because of  Leicester  city  football  club,  the
      restaurant is close to two universities and the train station, and the
      restaurant was reputable  and  had  been  nominated  for  awards.  The
      respondent failed to consider the information in the business plan and
      placed excessive and exclusive reliance on the interview. The  refusal
      decision did not accurately reflect the answers given in interview and
      the respondent failed to take into account material  factors  such  as
      the applicant's other restaurants and experience, the other parties to
      the business and the totality of the documents.

The Respondent's grounds and submissions

  11. In  the  acknowledgment  of  service,  the  respondent  submitted  the
      applicant was given more than 24 hours' notice of the interview and it
      was open to her to request for it to be re-arranged. She was happy  to
      be interviewed in English and made no request for an interpreter.  The
      applicant was given an opportunity to respond to questions  about  her
      business investment and the process was not procedurally  unfair.  The
      interview transcript demonstrated the applicant did not have knowledge
      of her business plan. The respondent submitted  it  is  reasonable  to
      expect a genuine entrepreneur to  have  conducted  extensive  research
      into their investment and to know the company's gross and  net  profit
      for the last financial year. The refusal of entry  clearance  was  not
      unfair, unlawful or irrational.



  12. Mr Malik relied on  his  skeleton  argument  and  submitted  that  the
      precise content of the duty to act  fairly  varies  according  to  the
      particular decision making context in which it falls to be decided. In
      this case the applicant had been given ample notice of  the  interview
      and that it would be conducted in  English.  The  respondent  was  not
      required  to  conduct  the  interview  with  the  assistance   of   an
      interpreter and the applicant was given  a  fair  opportunity  to  put
      forward  her  case.  The  present  case   was   distinguishable   from
      Balajigari. There was no evidential basis for the submission that  the
      applicant did not understand the questions in interview.  It  was  not
      her case on administrative review and  she  had  not  made  a  witness
      statement to that effect in these proceedings. There was no procedural
      unfairness in the decision making process.

  13. In relation to ground 2, this was not an  appeal  on  the  merits.  Mr
      Malik submitted the decision was not perverse and the weight  attached
      to a particular factor did  not  render  a  decision  irrational.  The
      decision was clear  and  provided  cogent  reasons  for  refusing  the
      application. The respondent did not have to refer to  each  and  every
      piece of evidence before him/her. The answers in  interview  were  not
      satisfactory and the respondent was  entitled  to  find  she  was  not
      satisfied  the  applicant  had  conducted  market  research  into  the
      location of the business and any suitable alternatives. The  applicant
      was unable to state if she would receive a salary  from  the  business
      and it was rational  for  the  respondent  to  doubt  the  applicant's
      intentions in this context. It was open to the respondent to  conclude
      that the applicant's lack of knowledge  of  how  the  funds  would  be
      invested and the gross or net profit for the previous  financial  year
      was not indicative of a genuine entrepreneur.

  14. There was no basis for stating  that  irrelevant  considerations  were
      taken into account and relevant considerations  were  not  taken  into
      account. The decision was one that fell within the range of reasonable
      responses open to the respondent.






Conclusions and reasons

Ground 1: Procedural unfairness

  15. The interview process was not procedurally unfair  for  the  following
      reasons. The applicant was aware from her  application  that  she  may
      have to attend an interview and adequate  notice  was  given.  It  was
      apparent from the invitation that the applicant could  reschedule  the
      interview, but she did not request to change the  date  or  time.  The
      applicant was aware the interview would be conducted  in  English  and
      she did not request an interpreter.  She  relied  on  her  command  of
      English in her application.


  16. The applicant was given an opportunity to demonstrate her knowledge of
      the business and the  interviewing  officer  did  not  recite  from  a
      prepared script. He asked further questions to clarify the applicant's
      answers and enabled the applicant to explain her answers. She did  not
      state in the interview that she did not understand the questions about
      the finances of the company  and  she  made  no  complaint  about  the
      conduct of her interview at the time or prior to her application being
      refused. It can be seen, in the  questions  and  answers  referred  to
      below, that the  respondent  did  not  adopt  an  inflexible  approach
      thereby denying the applicant an opportunity to clarify her answers: R
      (Anjum).


  17. The interviewing officer noted that the Applicant did  not  understand
      question 7. This was not relied  on  in  the  refusal  letter  and  no
      adverse inference was drawn from her answer.  It was not  apparent  at
      this stage that the applicant's ability to speak English was such that
      the interview should have  been  stopped  and  a  further  opportunity
      provided.

  18. It is clear when reading the interview as a whole that the Applicant's
      lack of knowledge of the business plan was not due to her inability to
      understand the questions. She did not know the gross or net profit  of
      the  business  and  the  figure  she  estimated  for  her  salary  was
      inconsistent with that given in the business plan. She  did  not  know
      how her significant investment  of  �280,000  would  be  allocated  to
      expand the business.


  19. The interviewing  officer's  comment  at  the  end  of  the  interview
      indicates that the process was  fair  and  adequate.  It  enabled  the
      decision maker to assess the  applicant's  answers  and  consider  any
      possible misunderstanding. The interviewing officer records  that  the
      applicant's English was poor and 'also' that she had little  knowledge
      of the finances of  the  company.  There  was  no  evidence  from  the
      applicant that she did not understand the questions about the finances
      of the company. I  find  that  the  decision-making  process  was  not
      procedurally unfair.


Ground 2: Irrationality

  20. I find that the  decision  is  not  unlawful  or  irrational  for  the
      following reasons. The applicant has invested a significant amount  of
      money into a business in the UK. It is not unreasonable to expect that
      a genuine entrepreneur  would  have  carried  out  research  into  the
      business and its location. The applicant does not state that  she  did
      not refer  Brighton  as  a  location.  Her  answer  in  interview  was
      contradictory. She initially stated she had  researched  Brighton  and
      later stated she did not need to research  location  because  she  was
      investing in a business recommended  by  a  friend.  The  respondent's
      conclusion that this undermined her  credibility  was  one  which  was
      reasonably open to him/her on the evidence.


  21. In answer to the question: 'Will you receive a salary and  if  so  how
      much?', the applicant replied "Oh we still did not set a  salary  yet"
      The interviewing officer gave the applicant an opportunity to  explain
      and asked 'Ok but will you  be  receiving  a  salary?'  The  applicant
      replied: "We have to have a meeting and talk about the profits and for
      the salary I am not sure about �3000 or �4000 but I'm  not  sure  ok."
      The interviewing officer sought clarification and asked,  'Would  that
      be �3000 per month?' The application replied; "I don't  know  I  don't
      know I guess but if the restaurant is  not  getting  too  much  return
      maybe I have to review." The applicant  was  clearly  unsure  and  the
      figure she gave was inconsistent with the business plan.  It  was  not
      unreasonable  for  the  respondent  to   conclude   that   a   genuine
      entrepreneur would know this information (i.e. salaries for  employees
      and directors). It was not material  that  the  full  answer  to  this
      question about salary was not set out in the  refusal  letter.  It  is
      apparent the applicant did  not  really  know  whether  she  would  be
      receiving a salary and she guessed an amount but was not sure  of  its
      accuracy.


  22. At question 20, the applicant is asked for  a  breakdown  of  how  her
      investment (�280,000 in this case) will be spent. She replies: "Oh  we
      will expand our food for like er Thai food so we have to maybe we  use
      I don't know much about how many but we have to pay for the expand  of
      the business and the marketing what er - the salary the er -  supply."
      The interviewing officer rephrases the question and asks, 'Do you know
      how much each of these will cost or do you have a breakdown of each of
      these things will cost?' The applicant replies: "I have no idea  right
      now maybe the cost of the salary is maybe about �16,000 by the time we
      meet my friend and we  talk  about  er  the  ad  we  have  to  put  in
      advertising, the brochure and the leaflet promotion maybe  2  -  2  or
      �25,000 something like this I can't give you accurate." The respondent
      acknowledged that the applicant was able to give an estimate,  but  it
      was not unreasonable to expect  the  applicant  to  know  the  precise
      amounts or to be able to refer to the breakdown in the business plan.

  23. The applicant stated that she had seen the company  accounts  but  she
      was unable to state the gross or net profit  for  the  last  financial
      year. I accept that being unable to recall the name of the accountants
      was understandable, but given the significant level of the applicant's
      investment  in  the  business  it  is  inconceivable  that  a  genuine
      entrepreneur would not know how much profit the business had generated
      in the previous year and its  projected  turnover  for  the  following
      year.

  24.  Paragraph  245DB(f)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  provides  that  the
      applicant must establish the following:
        i) She genuinely intends and is able to  establish,  take  over  or
           become a director of the business;
       ii) She genuinely intends to invest the money; and
      iii) The money is genuinely  available  to  the  applicant  and  will
           remain available to her until such time as it is spent  for  the
           purposes of her business.
  25. Evidence that the funds had already been transferred into the business
      and  the  applicant  had  become  a  director  did  not  preclude  the
      respondent from finding that the funds were not genuinely available to
      be invested in the  business.  The  applicant  must  satisfy  all  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules. The fact that the applicant had
      been awarded the claimed points for access and availability  of  funds
      did  not  prevent  such  a  conclusion.  The  issue  was  whether  the
      investment was genuine and the funds  would  remain  available  to  be
      spent for the purposes  of  the  business.  The  applicant's  lack  of
      knowledge of the financial circumstances  of  the  business  gave  the
      respondent  reasons  to  doubt  her   intentions.   The   respondent's
      conclusion, that the applicant had failed to show that  she  genuinely
      intended to invest money in a business  in  the  UK,  was  within  the
      reasonable range of responses open to him/her.

  26.  The  respondent  did  not  overlook  other  material   matters.   The
      applicant's credibility  was  seriously  undermined  by  her  lack  of
      knowledge of the business plan and the financial circumstances of  the
      business.  The  respondent's  conclusion  that  the  funds  were   not
      genuinely available to the applicant and she did not genuinely  intend
      to invest the money in the business in the UK was not irrational.  The
      respondent properly applied the relevant  Immigration  Rules  and  the
      decision was open to him/her on the material  before  him/her.   There
      was no procedural unfairness in the decision making process.

  27. Accordingly, I refuse this application. The decisions of 3  July  2019
      and 20 August 2019  were  not  unlawful,  irrational  or  unfair.  The
      application is dismissed.

  28. Mr Karim applied for permission to appeal on the grounds I  had  erred
      in terms of procedural unfairness and the ambit of paragraph 245DB (f)
      and (h).

  29. I refuse permission to appeal to the Court  of  Appeal.  There  is  no
      arguable case that I have erred in law or there is some  other  reason
      that requires consideration by the Court of Appeal.

  30. The Applicant to  pay  the  Respondent's  reasonable  costs  of  these
      proceedings, to be assessed if not agreed.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.
A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3.
