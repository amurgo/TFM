                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Samra (Harbans Singh Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of  12  July  2016  allowing  the  appeal  of
       Sandeep Singh, a citizen of India born 10 July 1983,  itself  brought
       against the Home Office refusal of his human rights claim of  12  May
       2015.


    2. The immigration history supplied by the Secretary of State  sets  out
       that the Respondent entered the United Kingdom on 14  December  2007,
       and was served with a notice of liability to removal  as  an  illegal
       entrant. His wife Sukhwinder was subsequently granted a family  visit
       visa which she used to enter the United Kingdom on  12  January  2010
       with their daughter Talveer. Another  daughter,  Jaskamal,  was  born
       here on 31  March  2011.  On  13  November  2014  an  application  to
       regularise the family's status  was  refused  without  the  right  of
       appeal. A human rights application of 17 February 2015 contended that
       the family had ties in this country and that the  best  interests  of
       the children pointed in favour of leave being  granted,  particularly
       given that the elder daughter had now been in school  here  for  some
       years.

    3. The Home Office refused the application  under  Appendix  FM  because
       there was no qualifying Sponsor  under  the  partner  route,  and  no
       viable application under the parent route having regard to  the  fact
       that the parents were in an extant relationship. Outside the Rules it
       was not considered unreasonable for the children to relocate to their
       country of nationality  where  their  parents  could  bring  them  up
       amongst a culture and society that would not  be  unfamiliar  to  the
       family unit.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal considered the appeal outside the Immigration
       Rules having regard to the five-stage  process  mandated  by  Razgar.
       Whilst the parents could be expected to replicate their private  life
       here back in their country of  origin,  there  would  be  significant
       interference with the private life of the elder child  who  had  been
       educated here since her arrival and had developed intellectually  and
       socially within the UK system, achieving success in her studies.  The
       interference was for a legitimate aim and in accordance with the law,
       which left the question of proportionality.

    5. Factors counting against removal being disproportionate included  the
       fact that the family  members  save  for  Talveer  had  been  present
       illegally, with an immigration status that could only  be  considered
       precarious and in circumstances where the father could reasonably  be
       assumed capable of resuming  his  agricultural   work  of  the  past.
       However, Talveer was of an age where  she  had  spent  a  significant
       period in this country,  applying  Azimi-Moayed,  and  had  developed
       social, cultural and educational ties that it would be  inappropriate
       to interrupt, bearing in mind that she had spent some 6ï¿½ years  here,
       which whilst a little shorter than the 7-year stay that public policy
       generally recognised as presumptively showing significant  ties,  was
       on the facts highly material, given her lengthy attendance at primary
       and secondary school in the UK.  Her  best  interests  without  doubt
       pointed in favour of her remaining here. It would be wrong  to  treat
       her  residence  here  as  a  trump  card,  applying  AM  Malawi,  but
       nevertheless this was not simply  a  case  which  one  could  readily
       equate to a typical transnational move made by  a  child  during  the
       course of its education, given that her  education  had  been  wholly
       within the United Kingdom. The Appellant was financially  independent
       and not dependent on  public  funds.  Having  regard  to  the  public
       interest, and treating the best interests of Jaskamal  as  a  primary
       consideration, the family's departure would be disproportionate.


    6. The Secretary of State lodged grounds of appeal against that decision
       arguing that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law  having  regard
       to the relevant test for assessing best interests and  reasonableness
       identified by MA (Pakistan)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705:  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had effectively  treated  best  interests  as  determinative
       without balancing them against other public interest factors.

    7. Judge Shaerf granted permission to appeal for the First-tier Tribunal
       to the Upper Tribunal on 16 November 2016  because  it  was  arguable
       that the reasoning of the Judge, which just pre-dated MA  (Pakistan),
       was discordant with the principles articulated therein.

    8. Before me Mr Richards argued that the First-tier Tribunal had clearly
       confused  itself  as  to  the  relevant  test:  its   reasoning   was
       inconsistent with the approach laid down by MA (Pakistan).  Mr  Samra
       submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had in fact conducted a  model
       balancing exercise rather than treating best interests  as  the  sole
       determinative consideration.


Findings and reasons

    9. The fundamental question on this appeal is whether the Tribunal below
       erred in law in its approach to the assessment of the public interest
       balanced against private rights. Where  this  analysis  is  conducted
       outside the Immigration Rules, the approach remains that set  out  by
       Lord Bingham in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27: i.e.


           "In a case where removal is resisted in reliance on  article  8,
           these questions are likely to be:
           (1)  Will the proposed removal be an interference  by  a  public
           authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to  respect
           for his private or (as the case may be) family life?
           (2)  If so, will such interference  have  consequences  of  such
           gravity as potentially to engage the operation of article 8?
           (3)  If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
           (4)  If so, is  such  interference  necessary  in  a  democratic
           society in the interests of national security, public safety  or
           the economic well-being of the country, for  the  prevention  of
           disorder or crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or
           for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?
           (5)  If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate
           public end sought to be achieved?"


   10. However, consideration outside the Rules does not represent a  wholly
       blank canvas upon which a Judge should paint. In  SS  (Congo)  &  Ors
       [2015] EWCA Civ 387, "it is accurate to say that the general position
       ... is that compelling circumstances would need to be  identified  to
       support a claim for grant of LTR outside the new Rules". At [48]  the
       Court goes on:

           "What does matter, however -  whether  one  is  dealing  with  a
           section of the Rules which constitutes a "complete code" (as  in
           MF (Nigeria)) or with a section of the  Rules  which  is  not  a
           "complete code" (as in Nagre and the present appeals)  -  is  to
           identify, for the purposes of  application  of  Article  8,  the
           degree of weight to be attached  to  the  expression  of  public
           policy in the substantive part of the Rules  in  the  particular
           context in question (which will not always be  the  same:  hence
           the guidance we seek to give in this judgment), as well  as  the
           other factors relevant to the Article 8  balancing  exercise  in
           the particular case (which, again, may well vary from context to
           context and from case to case)."


   11.  Shortly  after  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   under
       examination here was promulgated, Elias LJ in  MA  (Pakistan)  [2016]
       EWCA Civ 705 at [13] and [21] set out:


            "45 ...  [in  deportation  proceedings]  wider  public  interest
            considerations must be taken  into  account  when  applying  the
            "unduly harsh" criterion. It seems to me that it must be equally
            so with respect  to  the  reasonableness  criterion  in  section
            117B(6) ... where the seven year rule  is  satisfied,  it  is  a
            factor of some weight leaning in favour of leave to remain being
            granted
            49 ... the fact that the child has been  in  the  UK  for  seven
            years  would  need  to  be  given  significant  weight  in   the
            proportionality exercise for two related reasons: first, because
            of its relevance to determining the nature and strength  of  the
            child's best interests; and second, because it establishes as  a
            starting point that leave should be  granted  unless  there  are
            powerful reasons to the contrary.
            73 ... It may be reasonable to require the child to leave  where
            there are good cogent reasons, even if they are not compelling."

   12. However, MA (Pakistan) is not directly addressing  the  situation  of
       the proportionality balancing exercise in a case  which  is  assessed
       wholly outside the Rules where there is no qualifying child  as  part
       of the family unit. In such an  appeal,  the  primary  focus  is  not
       simply on the question of "reasonableness",  identified  as  relevant
       both by Rule  276ADE(iv)  and  section  117B(6)  of  the  Nationality
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002; rather the requirement, once  it  is
       accepted that there is private life in play with which  the  decision
       appealed represents a significant interference,  is  to  balance  all
       relevant interests against one another.


   13. In this appeal, it is clear that that was done. A number  of  factors
       in favour of the Home Office decision to remove  being  proportionate
       are identified, such as  the  likely  continued  connections  of  the
       father of the family in Pakistan, and the poor immigration history of
       the parents. But the circumstances of the elder child  are  found  to
       outweigh those considerations,  the  key  factors  identified  within
       section  117B  of  the  2002  Act  having  been   given   appropriate
       consideration. The child's best interests are expressly  not  treated
       as a trump card, and nor is there  any  misunderstanding  as  to  the
       weight to be afforded her length of residence.

   14. I therefore conclude that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was
       properly open to it on the evidence, and that it is wholly lawful and
       rational.

   15. The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.

Signed                                       Date  12 January 2017
