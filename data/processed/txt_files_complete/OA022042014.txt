For the Respondent:    Mr Bandegani of Counsel, instructed by Sky
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1) This is an appeal on behalf of the Entry Clearance  Officer  against  a
    decision by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Petherbridge  allowing  an
    appeal by Mr Muhammad Aslam  Baig  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  "the
    applicant").

 2) The applicant was born on  9  September  1937  and  is  a  national  of
    Pakistan.  He applied for entry clearance as a  dependant  relative  on
    the basis that as a result of age, illness or  disability  he  requires
    long term personal care to perform everyday tasks.  The application was
    refused by the Entry Clearance Officer because the  applicant  had  not
    shown that the care required could not be provided in his home country.



 3) The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was that the  applicant  is
    an elderly man, aged 74, without any pension.  The applicant  has  five
    children, four of whom live in the UK.  One of the sons, the sponsor in
    this appeal, Ashraf, worked as an operations  clerk  and  earned  about
    �1,350 a month.  He is married with two children and his wife works  as
    an accountant, earning about �5,500 net per month.   The  fifth  child,
    Arshad, is married and lives separately in Pakistan with his  wife  and
    child.  The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was that Arshad has
    no contact with the applicant and had never been involved in his  care.



 4) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, at paragraph 32 of the  decision,
    had regard to the Home Office guidance on the requirements of an  adult
    dependant relative.  According to the guidance the applicant must as  a
    result of  age,  illness  or  disability  be  incapable  of  performing
    everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and cooking.  Evidence of  the
    applicant's physical or  mental  condition  giving  rise  to  inability
    should be provided from a doctor or health professional.  At  paragraph
    33 the judge noted  that  evidence  that  the  required  care  was  not
    available should be provided from a central or local  health  authority
    or a doctor or other health professional.

 5) The First-tier Tribunal had before it a letter dated 26  December  2015
    from the Office of the Medical Superintendent of the Services  Hospital
    in Lahore.  This states that the applicant was receiving  treatment  at
    the hospital and was suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary
    disease), high blood pressure, glaucoma and debility.  He suffers  from
    early fatigue and weakness as a result of which he  requires  permanent
    supervision and support in his daily  routine,  i.e.  taking  medicine,
    taking/consuming food,  using  bathroom  and/or  shower,  and  changing
    clothes, etc.  It is further stated  that  there  was  no  hospital  or
    facility that could offer such effective professional care  on  a  long
    term basis.  It was recommended that a responsible adult look after him
    at all times and be available for his care for 24 hours  a  day.   This
    would be required on a permanent basis until recovery of  the  patient.
    Regarding these last words, "until recovery of the patient", the  judge
    noted that  at  78  years  of  age  the  possibility  of  recovery  was
    speculative and indeed unlikely.

 6) The judge heard oral evidence from the sponsor's wife.  She stated that
    her mother-in-law, the applicant's wife, came to live in the  UK  three
    years previously and since then they had had to arrange for  full  time
    care for the applicant.  None of the carers whom they had employed  was
    satisfactory.  The carers could either provide  the  medical  attention
    required by the applicant or deal with the household  chores  but  they
    were unable to do both.   The  witness  found  that  "familiarity  bred
    contempt" and that after a short period the carers would take advantage
    of the applicant's inability to do anything for himself.  In all  three
    instances the standard of care left much to be desired.   This  was  so
    much so that the sponsor had had to give up his job to go  to  Pakistan
    where he had been since October 2015 looking  after  his  father.   The
    applicant's health had deteriorated since the application was  made  in
    2013.  He was  now  less  mobile.   He  needed  support  going  to  the
    bathroom.  Because of his loneliness he was suffering from  depression.
    Before going to Pakistan in October 2015 her husband used to  call  his
    father on a daily basis.  The situation where her husband was living in
    Pakistan to look after his father was  not  one  which  could  continue
    indefinitely.  The judge found the applicant's daughter-in-law to be  a
    credible witness.

 7)  According  to  the  submissions  recorded  by  the  judge,  the   only
    contentious  issue  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  related  to  the
    applicant's remaining son living  in  Pakistan.   He  was  said  to  be
    estranged from the family  but  he  had  provided  an  affidavit.   The
    evidence of the sponsor's wife was that her husband  had  pleaded  with
    his brother to provide the affidavit, which  he  eventually  did.   The
    judge appears to have concluded that the estranged son had an  interest
    in providing the affidavit because if the applicant was allowed to come
    to the UK he would be relieved of any responsibility for looking  after
    his father.  The judge accepted that the applicant's  son  in  Pakistan
    was estranged from his father and would not provide care.

 8) The application for permission to appeal was  made  on  behalf  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer on the basis that the medical  evidence  showed
    that although there was no hospital facility that could offer care  for
    the applicant, there was no finding to the effect that care  could  not
    be made available in Pakistan, whether provided by the "estranged  son"
    or by the family employing a carer on a long term basis.

 9) Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it was arguable that
    there had been no finding with reasons why care could not  be  provided
    in Pakistan either by the "estranged son"  or  by  a  long  term  carer
    employed by the family.

10) There did not appear to be a rule 24 notice on behalf of the  applicant
    but I was provided by Mr Bandegani with a skeleton argument.

Submissions

11) For the Entry Clearance Officer, Mr Avery submitted that  the  question
    was whether the judge  properly  dealt  with  the  issue  of  the  care
    required in Pakistan.  The judge looked at the care being  provided  by
    the family and the claim that the sponsor could not remain in  Pakistan
    indefinitely.  The family said that it had not been possible to find an
    individual to do the job properly but this did not mean it would not be
    possible to find a suitable person if more effort was  made.   Pakistan
    has a substantial population and a person could be found  even  if  the
    person did not meet all the specifications the family would like.   The
    fact the family had not found someone did  not  mean  that  no-one  was
    available.

12) Mr Avery referred to the letter from the hospital in Lahore, quoted  at
    paragraph 35 of the decision.  He  pointed  out  that  the  letter  was
    written in 2015 whereas the Entry Clearance Officer's decision was made
    in November 2013.  There was a discussion of the meaning  of  the  term
    "the circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision" in section
    85A(2) of the 2002 Act.  Mr Avery submitted that it was not clear  from
    the letter what the circumstances were at the  date  of  decision.   Mr
    Bandegani pointed out that this had not been raised in the  application
    for permission to appeal.  Mr Avery acknowledged this but said that the
    judge should have considered the point.

13) Mr Avery concluded his submission by saying  that  the  judge  did  not
    engage with the fact that in a country the  size  of  Pakistan  it  was
    difficult to believe that care for the applicant was not available.

14) It was pointed out that the judge had  to  be  satisfied  only  on  the
    balance of probabilities that care was not available.

Discussion

15) I indicated to Mr Bandegani that I did not require to hear from him.  I
    had before me his skeleton argument, to which  I  shall  now  refer  in
    summary.  It is submitted in the skeleton argument that the  appeal  is
    an attempt by the Entry Clearance Officer to re-open the merits of  the
    appeal where all the evidence was against the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    and in favour of the applicant.   No  issue  was  taken  by  the  Entry
    Clearance  Officer  in  relation   to   financial   considerations   or
    suitability requirements.  The evidence of the applicant's daughter-in-
    law, which was accepted by the judge, was that she and her husband have
    had to arrange full time care for the applicant for  over  three  years
    since her mother-in-law, the applicant's wife, came to live in the  UK.
    The judge considered  the  position  with  regard  to  the  applicant's
    estranged son and made a clear finding in favour of  the  applicant  to
    the effect that the son would not provide care.

16) According to the skeleton argument the care needs of the applicant were
    set out in the letter from the hospital in Lahore  and  in  affidavits,
    particularly one from the sponsor.   This  affidavit  stated  that  the
    sponsor had been unable to arrange suitable care for the  applicant  in
    Pakistan and this was supported by evidence from other members  of  the
    family.   This  evidence  was  consistent  with  the  evidence  of  the
    applicant's daughter-in-law.  The judge gave adequate reasons  for  his
    decision, having identified and recorded  all  the  matters  that  were
    critical to the outcome in such  a  way  that  the  decision  could  be
    understood.

17) I am satisfied that  the  decision  of  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal sets out findings of fact on the relevant issues based on  the
    evidence and supported by adequate reasons.  Although the  letter  from
    the hospital in Lahore post-dates the date of decision, this issue  was
    not raised before the First-tier Tribunal and was  not  raised  in  the
    application for permission  to  appeal.   The  statutory  provision  in
    section 85A  does  not  bar  consideration  of  post-decision  evidence
    provided it relates  to  circumstances  appertaining  at  the  date  of
    decision.  It was apparent from the evidence before the  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  that  the  applicant's  need  for  care,  and  the
    difficulties in providing it, had subsisted for at least  three  years,
    since before the refusal decision was made.   The  care  needs  of  the
    applicant are precisely those contemplated by paragraph  E-ECDR.2.4  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

18) The Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  correctly  identified  that  the
    issues for consideration were whether the required level of care  could
    be provided in Pakistan and whether there was no person in that country
    who could reasonably provide it.  On the latter point, the question was
    whether the applicant's remaining son in Pakistan would care  for  him.
    The son was  said  to  be  estranged  from  the  applicant.   He  lives
    separately and has a wife and child of his own.  His evidence was  that
    he would not care for the applicant.  The judge accepted this evidence.
     While there seemed to be an acknowledgement that the estranged son had
    an interest in refusing to care for his father,  the  evidence  of  the
    other members of the family  was  that  the  relationship  between  the
    applicant and this son had broken down.  The judge was entitled to make
    a finding to the effect that care was not available from the  estranged
    son.

19) Furthermore, strong evidence in support of the  difficulty  of  finding
    suitable care is to be found in the fact  that  the  sponsor  has  been
    living in Pakistan since 2015 to care  for  the  applicant.   His  wife
    understandably  said  that  this   arrangement   could   not   continue
    indefinitely.  Mr Avery was  reluctant  to  accept  that  in  Pakistan,
    because of its size, there was no person who could  reasonably  provide
    care.  The evidence of the family was that  there  had  been  at  least
    three attempts to employ carers, each of which ended in  failure.   Not
    only were the carers unable to attend to all of the  applicant's  needs
    but they sought to take advantage of him.

20) The standard of proof in this appeal is the balance  of  probabilities.
    The applicant does not need to show beyond this standard that there  is
    no-one in Pakistan who can reasonably provide  the  care  he  requires.
    The position is that  the  family  have  attempted  to  make  provision
    several times and have not been able to do so.  The judge was  entitled
    to find on the evidence that the requirement  in  paragraph  E-ECDR.2.5
    was satisfied and that care could not be provided in Pakistan.

21) As the Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  the  relevant
    requirements of Immigration Rules were met,  the  appeal  was  allowed.
    The judge did not err in law in so doing.

Conclusions

22) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error of law.

23) I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

24) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order for  anonymity.   I  have
    not been asked to make such an order and I see no reason  of  substance
    for doing so.
