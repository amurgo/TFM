                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

HH JUDGE STACEY: This is the substantive hearing of the applicant's
application for judicial review of the Secretary of State for the Home
Department's delay in determining the applicant's application for
indefinite leave to remain which was submitted on 7 August 2017.
Permission on the papers was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Gleeson on 8
August 2019. At the same time she also made various case management orders
including for the applicant to reply to the respondent's detailed grounds
by 3 October 2019 and for the applicant to lodge skeleton arguments and a
bundle for this hearing by 22 October 2019, none of which was done by the
due date.

Preliminary issue


On 4 November 2019 an application for an extension of time was served
together with the reply to the respondent's detailed grounds of defence and
the bundle which included, unusually, a witness statement from the
applicant himself for which no special permission had been sought.  The
skeleton argument was not served until yesterday, 11 November 2019.  It
caused additional work and inconvenience for the Government Legal
Department in chasing the applicant's solicitors

I find that the delay was not significant or substantial and there was
still sufficient time for all preparation to be undertaken in readiness for
today's hearing.  In spite of a lack of detailed explanation and a failure
by the applicant's solicitors to apply prior to the expiry of the time
limit, in light of the lack of prejudice to the respondent, I do,
exceptionally, extend time for compliance and allow the documents and
bundle to be before the tribunal.

The Secretary of State's concerns about the limited relevance of the
applicant's witness statement and lack of permission to rely on it were
well-made but is an argument which cuts both ways and I do not exclude it
from the bundle and will give it appropriate weight. No request was made to
cross-examine the applicant. I bear in mind the issues that this court has
to determine, which of course are not to assess the merits or otherwise of
the applicant's Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) application.

However Mr Claire and those who instruct him are reminded of the importance
of timely compliance with Orders of the Tribunal for the future and should
know that the issue was finely balanced and the decision could easily have
gone the other way.

Background facts

The background facts and history of the litigation are as follows.  On 22
August 2012 the applicant was recognised as a stateless person as a Kuwaiti
Bidoon and was granted asylum for a period of five years.  He applied for
ILR under the settlement protection route on 7 August 2017.  His
application has not yet been decided. The aim is for applications to be
decided within six to twelve months. The applicant was written to on 31
January, 14 May and 18 October 2018 and on 25 January 2019 and in May 2019,
explaining that because the application raised exceptionally complex issues
which required further time to consider and reach a decision, the intended
target would not be met.  In May of this year he was told it was very much
hoped that a decision would be made within four to six months, which would
take us until the end of November.

The evidence of the respondent was given in a statement from by Chris
Jones, Higher Executive Officer, Senior Caseworker of the Status Review
Unit (SRU), Refugee Revocation Team.  The exceptionally complex issues
referred to in the various letters are that on 19 July 2017 the applicant
was encountered at Baghdad Airport attempting to travel to the UK using an
Iraqi passport with the same first name as the one he is known by to the
respondent, Ahmed Fahad, but a different surname, Khalaf Al-Zubaidi.

As a result of that, his case was referred to the SRU for investigation.
The issue for investigation is whether he is a Kuwaiti Bidoon or an Iraqi
citizen, the respondent's concern being that if he is not the former it
calls into question the original grant of asylum and refugee status. If he
is in fact an Iraqi citizen and national, then different considerations
would apply and there could be issues of dishonesty perhaps. It is not my
role to decide, but merely to note the cause of the concern that made the
case exceptionally complex in the Secretary of State's view.

The respondent accepts that no investigation by the SRU commenced until May
2019 due to pressure of work and caseload levels.  As Chris Jones explains,
the volume and complexity of referrals into the SRU along with the limited
resources available in 2017 resulted in a delay to the unit being able to
commence investigations in Mr Al-Shammari's case but since then, the SRU
has expanded and has increased its capacity for pursuing investigations and
the delays are now being reduced and cases are being progressed. and I note
in passing that the defendant has produced some evidence in the form of
Chris Jones's statement about the manner in which the Secretary of State
has decided to deal with the claim and the steps being taken and the strain
on resources together with the need to investigate. Chris Jones's statement
about the manner in which the Secretary of State has decided to deal with
the claim and the steps being taken and the strain on resources together
with the need to investigate it was not challenged by the applicant.

The applicant was written to regularly, as already mentioned, explaining
the further delays even though no precise details were being given of any
steps being taken, presumably because none were being taken. He was well
aware of the respondent's concern over the passport he was found with in
Baghdad, which he has maintained was a false passport, so he may therefore
have required less information than might otherwise be the case.

No special features causing prejudice by the delay have been identified by
the applicant and I note his witness statement merely states that he urges
the Upper Tribunal to give the respondent a timeframe to decide his case
"as I cannot wait indefinitely for the respondent to decide my case".  No
special features or factors were identified by the Secretary of State
either.  His Leave To Remain has been extended under Section 3C Immigration
Act 1971 and his benefits and entitlements have therefore continued as
before whilst his application is pending.

In April of 2019 his solicitors wrote to the Secretary of State and a pre-
action Protocol letter was served on 20 May.  The application for judicial
review was lodged on 9 July and there is no suggestion that it was delayed
or lodged outside the applicable time limit.

On 12 September the applicant was served with a notice of intention to
cancel or revoke his refugee status.  In accordance with the procedure
observations were received from the UNHCR on 11 November and a final
decision is now anticipated by mid-December within the next four weeks, Mr
Anderson explained today.

The law

Turning to the law, there are a number of uncontroversial principles.
Firstly, there is an implicit obligation to decide applications within a
reasonable time.  What amounts to a reasonable time is a flexible concept
allowing the scope to consider what is reasonable in all the relevant
circumstances of any particular case.  The approach is that to be taken in
Article 6(1) cases on the right to a fair trial to a determination of civil
and other rights within a reasonable period.  That is a different exercise
entirely to a Convention 5(4) case where an applicant may be in detention.
That is not the case here.

Discussion and conclusions

The relevant factors in this case that I take note of in assessing what is
a reasonable period and whether there has been any irrationality and
unlawfulness in the Secretary of State's decision are as follows.

I accept that Chris Jones did not provide a very detailed statement and
other cases might require more detail but it is sufficient from that for me
to find that this was a complex case requiring investigation of the facts
and liaison with officials in Baghdad, an important and difficult
investigation of the facts which we know are disputed. This was not a run
of the mill ILR application after an uneventful previous 5 years of LTR. In
fact, the applicant's witness statement talks of his having two, not one,
Iraqi passports, and of his travelling to Lebanon and then on to the UK, so
the position may be even more complex than that suggested by the
respondent. Where issues of potential fraud and credibility are involved
rigour is required in an investigation and these things do unfortunately
take time, not helped by the fact that much of the information would be in
Iraq, and the current difficulties in that country.

Secondly, the applicant has had the continued benefit of LTR and refugee
status during the investigation and continued to receive the same support
as before. There has therefore been no deterioration or downgrading of his
rights and entitlements pending the decision.  Whilst I accept that there
are some additional benefits conferred by ILR, those are not significant in
the scheme of things in general terms and it is important to note that the
applicant has not identified any particular aspect of disadvantage. I infer
that if he had considered there to have been a particular disadvantage he
would have said so in his witness statement.

Thirdly, there are no other particulars of detriment identified by the
applicant that the Home Office has failed to alleviate.

Fourthly, the applicant has been updated and to some extent informed and
those letters are important because they have managed his expectations to
some extent to be prepared for a delay and explained that his case is still
being considered and he has not been entirely forgotten.  It was better
than receiving no letters at all although I accept that they could perhaps
have been more detailed, but he knew that the difficulty was his attempt to
travel to the UK from Baghdad on an Iraqi passport.

Fifthly, the period of delay in question is some two and a half years.
That is considerably less than the ten years, in, for example, the case of
SSHD v Said [2018] EWCA Civ 627 or the five year period in the case of
R(FH) and Ors v SSHD [2007] EWHC 1571, and in any event, the facts can be
distinguished from those two cases where the applicants were in more
vulnerable and challenging positions.

Two and a half years is, I accept, a long time to be kept waiting and I
accept that the uncertainty will have gnawed away at this young man and
engendered a sense of drift and perhaps even paralysis by his not knowing
the outcome of his application. But the respondent has provided a
reasonable explanation and in all the circumstances, the delay has not been
unreasonable.  It is not irrational and it follows that nor is it unlawful.

Considering the guidance in FH and the conclusion at paragraph 30 of that
case that claims based on delay are unlikely, save in very exceptional
circumstances, to succeed and it is only if the delay is so excessive as to
be regarded as manifestly unreasonable and to fall outside any proper
application of the policy or if the claimant is suffering some particular
detriment which the Home Office has failed to alleviate that a claim might
be entertained by the court, it is apparent and it follows that the case
before me of Mr Al-Shammari does not fall into their category.

Accordingly, the claim is dismissed.

On a summary assessment I order the applicant pay the respondent's costs of
�4,500 (inclusive of Counsel's fees and all other disbursements) payable by
11 December 2019 or within 14 days the date of promulgation of this
judgment, whichever is the later.

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
