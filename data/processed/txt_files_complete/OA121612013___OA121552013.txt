                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. Although no anonymity direction was made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    and there was no request for anonymity,  I  have  decided  to  make  an
    anonymity order pursuant to rule 14 of The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 because the second Appellant is a minor.

 2. The Appellants appeal against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Crawford promulgated on 24th April 2014.

 3. The Appellants are Indian citizens born 20th August 1980 and  16th  May
    2012 respectively.  They applied for entry clearance to enable them  to
    join the Sponsor L G, who is settled in the United Kingdom, and who  is
    the spouse of  the  first  Appellant  and  the  father  of  the  second
    Appellant.

 4. The applications were refused on 2nd May  2013  on  financial  grounds.
    The Respondent pointed out that the Sponsor needed to evidence a  gross
    annual income of at least �22,400 to satisfy financial requirements set
    out in Appendix FM.  The specified documents required by Appendix FM-SE
    had not been submitted with the  application  to  prove  the  Sponsor's
    annual gross income and therefore the applications  were  refused  with
    reference to E-ECP.3.1 in relation  to  the  first  Appellant,  and  E-
    ECC.1.6 of Appendix FM in relation to the second Appellant.

 5. The  Appellants'  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  contended  in
    summary, that the financial requirements of Appendix FM were satisfied,
    and that the decision to refuse entry clearance breached Article  8  of
    the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 6. The appeals were heard together by Judge Crawford (the judge)  on  11th
    April 2014.  It was agreed by the representatives before the First-tier
    Tribunal, that the only documents that had not been submitted with  the
    applications for entry clearance,  were  that  only  six  months'  bank
    statements  had  been  produced,  rather  than  twelve   months.    The
    requirement in Appendix FM-SE is that in a case such  as  this,  twelve
    months bank statements covering the same twelve  month  period  as  the
    Sponsor's tax return must be submitted.

 7. The judge found that twelve months bank  statements  for  the  required
    period had been submitted, although only six months had been  submitted
    with  the  application.   The  judge  found  at  paragraph  7  of   the
    determination, that  the  Respondent's  bundle  contained  overwhelming
    evidence that the Sponsor earned well in excess of �22,400,  which  was
    the required minimum annual amount.  However the judge decided that  he
    could not take into account, the bank  statements  that  had  not  been
    submitted with the application, as he could only decide the case on the
    evidence produced with the application to the Entry Clearance  Officer.
    Therefore for  this  reason,  the  appeals  were  dismissed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 8. The judge considered Article 8 of the  1950  Convention  and  concluded
    that because the Immigration Rules could not be satisfied,  refusal  of
    entry clearance was proportionate and did not breach Article 8.

 9. The Appellants applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,
    contending  in  brief  summary  that  the  judge  had  erred   in   his
    consideration of the financial requirements of Appendix FM  and  failed
    to properly consider Article 8.

10. Permission to appeal was granted,  and  directions  issued  that  there
    should be an oral  hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  ascertain
    whether the First-tier Tribunal determination  disclosed  an  error  of
    law.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

11. Mr Harrison conceded that the judge was wrong in  law  in  finding,  in
    paragraph 7 of the determination, that he could only decide the case on
    the evidence before the Entry Clearance Officer.  Mr Harrison  accepted
    that  the  judge  could  have  considered  bank  statements  that  were
    submitted after the application.

12. I therefore did not need to hear from Mr Ceesay in relation to error of
    law.  I decided Mr Harrison was right to concede an error of  law,  and
    that the judge could have considered the  six  months  bank  statements
    that were  submitted  after  the  application,  which  meant  that  the
    Appellants  had  then  submitted  the  twelve  months  bank  statements
    required by Appendix FM-SE.

13. In relation to re-making the decision, Mr Harrison  accepted  that  the
    only issue which caused the appeals to be  dismissed,  related  to  the
    twelve months bank statements and as it was accepted  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal could have taken those into account, and those statements
    did cover the required period,  that  being  the  same  period  as  the
    Sponsor's tax return, the appeals were not  opposed,  as  the  evidence
    proved that the Sponsor did have  annual  earnings  in  excess  of  the
    required amount of �22,400.

14. Mr Ceesay submitted that  the  appeals  should  be  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules, and that Article 8 need only be  considered  in  the
    alternative, if the appeal was dismissed under the rules.

15. I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

16. It is clear that it was accepted before the  First-tier  Tribunal  that
    the Sponsor's annual income was well in excess of the �22,400 required.
     The judge recorded that the evidence in the  Respondent's  bundle  was
    overwhelming.

17. The only issue related to the fact that six months bank statements  had
    been submitted with the application rather than  twelve  months,  which
    were required to cover the same period as the Sponsor's tax return.

18. In my view the  judge  erred  in  not  taking  into  account  the  bank
    statements that were submitted subsequent to the application.  This  is
    not an appeal under the points-based system, therefore  section  85A(4)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which restricts the
    Tribunal to considering evidence adduced by an Appellant only if it was
    submitted in support of and at the time of making the application, does
    not apply.

19. Paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE restricts an Entry Clearance  Officer  or
    the Secretary of State to only considering  documents  that  have  been
    submitted  with  the  application,  unless  certain  exceptions  apply.
    However in my view this paragraph does not apply to the Tribunal.

20. This is an appeal against refusal of  entry  clearance,  therefore  the
    Tribunal is restricted by section 85A of the 2002 Act,  to  considering
    the circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision  to  refuse,
    which was 2nd May  2013.   The  bank  statements  in  question  do  not
    postdate the date of refusal, therefore in my view they are  admissible
    in evidence.

21. I therefore conclude, having set aside the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, that the specified evidence required by Appendix  FM-SE,  has
    been submitted and that evidence proves that the financial requirements
    of Appendix FM are satisfied.  Therefore the appeals are allowed  under
    the Immigration Rules.  There  is  therefore  no  need  to  go  on  and
    consider Article 8.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeals are allowed under the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

I remind the parties that an anonymity  order  has  been  made  because  the
second Appellant is a minor.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As the appeals are allowed I have considered whether to make  a  fee  award.
I do not consider it appropriate.  The Appellants did  not  provide  all  of
the specified evidence to the Entry Clearance Officer.  There  is  therefore
no fee award.
