Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Spurling, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of the Ukraine born  on  3rd  January  1971.
    The Appellant entered the UK as a visitor with a  valid  visa  on  21st
    July 2007.  That visa expired in January 2008.  On 15th  November  2011
    the Appellant was issued with IS151A as  an  overstayer,  arrested  and
    detained.  The Appellant  was  released  on  13th  December  2011  from
    detention and on 31st December 2011 married Mr  Farooq  Dar  a  British
    citizen.

 2. On 4th July 2012  the  Appellant  lodged  an  application  pursuant  to
    Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights contending that it
    would breach her human rights to return her to the  Ukraine  a  country
    listed in Section 94(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002.  The Appellant's application of 4th July 2012  whilst  requesting
    that the Appellant's circumstances be  considered  under  the  European
    Convention of Human Rights also within an  accompanying  letter  raised
    issues  regarding  asylum  but  on  24th  March  2013  the  Appellant's
    instructed solicitors wrote to the  Home  Office  confirming  that  the
    Appellant would not be making an  asylum  claim  and  provided  further
    evidence  of  her  relationship  with  her  partner.   The  Appellant's
    application pursuant to the European Convention  of  Human  Rights  was
    refused by the Secretary of State on 21st February 2014.

 3. The Appellant appealed and the appeal  came  before  Immigration  Judge
    Braybrook  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  12th  March  2015.    In   a
    determination promulgated on 20th March 2015 the Appellant's appeal was
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

 4. On 7th April 2015 the Appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  On 18th May 2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Shimmin
    granted permission to appeal.  In  granting  permission  Judge  Shimmin
    considered that it was arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  had
    not taken the correct approach to the "insurmountable  obstacles"  test
    in the light of Sanade  and  Others  (British  children  -  Zambrano  -
    Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048.  He also considered that the judge may  have
    erred in law in refusing to factor into the Article  8  assessment  the
    Appellant's current inability to succeed in an application from  abroad
    under the Immigration Rules and the reasons why she would fail.

 5. It was on that basis that  the  appeal  came  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there had been a material error of law in  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal.  It was  Counsel's  submission  that  there
    were two principal errors of law in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge.  Firstly he contends that the judge's approach  to  the
    assessment of "insurmountable obstacles" is flawed  and  secondly  that
    the judge's approach to the assessment of the  facts  relevant  to  the
    Article 8 assessment is also flawed and that the judge  has  failed  to
    give proper consideration to  the  authorities  of  Sanade  and  Others
    (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048 and  Chikwamba
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40.

 6. Mr Spurling when addressing the issue of insurmountable obstacles  drew
    to my attention the IDIs 2013  that  were  in  place  at  the  date  of
    decision and submitted that the judge had failed to consider the impact
    of the assessment of the Sanade principle namely that whilst  accepting
    that in a case where a third country national  is  unable  to  claim  a
    right to reside it will not logically be possible  when  assessing  the
    compatibility of their removal or deportation with the  ECHR  to  argue
    that any interference with Article 8 rights could  be  avoided  by  the
    family unit moving to a country which is outside the EU.  He  submitted
    that it is necessary to look at paragraph EX.1 of the Immigration Rules
    and  submits  that  the  appeal  can  only  fail  if   there   are   no
    insurmountable obstacles in the Appellant returning to the Ukraine.  It
    was his submission that there has been  a  failure  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge to consider the  assessment  as  set  out  at  paragraph
    3.2.7(c) of the IDIs in force in May  2013  in  the  assessment  as  to
    whether or not there are insurmountable obstacles.  He  submitted  that
    the analysis of the judge places it within the Sanade principle.

 7. The Home Office submitted that paragraphs 15 and 16 of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge's  decision  addressed  the  issue  of   insurmountable
    obstacles and considered that the judge had addressed this  along  with
    the relevant authorities at paragraph 25.

 8. Mr Spurling's response contended that the difficulty of what the  judge
    had said at paragraph 25 was that he has refused to consider  the  real
    impact of requiring the Appellant to go back to the  Ukraine  and  that
    this was not straightforward because the Sponsor would not  only  need,
    if that situation arises, to have an income of  ï¿½18,600  but  he  would
    have to  have  had  this  for  six  months  immediately  prior  to  the
    application.  Consequently not only did the Sponsor therefore  need  to
    find a job for an application to succeed in such circumstances  but  he
    must have been in that job for a continuous period of six months.

 9. The Home Office indicated that the Secretary of State was aware of this
    and referred me to paragraphs 23  to  28  of  the  original  Notice  of
    Refusal which they claimed addresses this issue.  They acknowledged the
    position that the Appellant and Sponsor might find  themselves  in  but
    pointed out that the Immigration Rules are specific and are there to be
    followed.

10. Mr Spurling disagreed pointing out that paragraphs  23  to  28  of  the
    Notice of Refusal do not address the issue of Article 8  and  that  the
    guidance given in Sanade was neither mentioned nor considered.

11. On that basis I found that there was a material error  of  law  in  the
    approach adopted by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The judge  appeared
    only to have considered Article 8 rather than the  position  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  Whilst paragraph 25 of  the  decision  appeared  to
    accept the Sanade principles the methodology of approach seemed  to  be
    wrong in that the Rules should  be  considered  first  before  a  free-
    standing Article 8 application outside the Rules is looked at and it is
    necessary to look at the position that would arise under Sanade.  It is
    a matter for submission and argument if the Sponsor is not required  to
    go outside the European Union i.e. to the Ukraine as to whether or  not
    insurmountable obstacles actually arise.

12. Further the First-tier Tribunal did not appear to have given  full  due
    and proper consideration to the IDIs in place in May 2013  namely  that
    when assessing an application under paragraph EX.1.(b)  in  determining
    whether there are "insurmountable obstacles" the decision-maker  should
    consider the seriousness of the difficulties which  the  applicant  and
    their partner would face in continuing their family life outside the UK
    and whether they entail something that  could  not  (or  could  not  be
    expected to) be overcome, even with a degree of  hardship  for  one  or
    more of the individuals concerned.

13. In such circumstances having been satisfied that  there  were  material
    errors of law I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    and gave directions for the rehearing of this matter.  On 3rd  December
    2015 the matter came back before me  and  was  adjourned  with  further
    leave to the Appellants  to  vary  the  original  directions.   It  was
    recorded therein that the Appellant no longer sought  to  rely  on  the
    submission as to whether or not the First-tier Tribunal Judge took  the
    correct approach to the insurmountable obstacles test in the  light  of
    Sanade and others (British children - Sambrano -  Dereci)  [2012]  UKUT
    00048 and now relied on grounds pursuant to  the  Appellant's  skeleton
    argument  and   the   documentation   attached   to   the   Appellant's
    supplementary bundle filed on 25th November 2015.  Thereinafter I  gave
    further procedural directions leading to the rehearing of this  matter.
    It is on that basis that the appeal comes back before me for rehearing.
     The Appellant continues to be represented by her instructed Counsel Mr
    Spurling who has had considerable involvement in this matter  including
    attending court hearings and being the author  of  skeleton  arguments.
    On this occasion the Secretary of State  appears  by  her  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer Mr Duffy.

Evidence

14. The Appellant is in attendance  and  available  for  cross-examination.
    However Mr Spurling does not submit the Appellant for cross-examination
    and Mr Duffy  does  not  require  any  further  oral  testimony  to  be
    provided.  In that instance it is agreed that the matter will be  dealt
    with at this stage and hereinafter by way of submissions.

Submissions /Discussions

15. Mr Spurling starts by reminding me of the facts in  this  matter.   The
    Appellant is a Ukrainian national born on 3rd January 1971.  She is  44
    years old and has been living in the UK since she arrived  on  a  visit
    visa on 21st July 2007.  It is accepted that her visit visa expired  in
    January 2008 and she has overstayed.  She met her husband Farooq  Ahmed
    Dar, a British  citizen,  in  the  summer  of  2009.   They  started  a
    relationship soon after their meeting and by late 2009 they were living
    together and have lived together ever since  except  for  a  period  of
    about a month following 15th November 2011 when the Secretary of  State
    frustrated  their  first  attempt  to  get  married  by  arresting  the
    Appellant  on  their  wedding  day  and  taking  her  into  immigration
    detention.

16. The Appellant was released from detention on  13th  December  2011  and
    they successfully got married just two weeks later  on  31st  December.
    The current appeal stems from an application for  leave  to  remain  in
    reliance upon the Appellant's rights under Article 8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights which was  submitted  to  the  Secretary  of
    State as long ago as 4th July 2012.

17. Since then Mr Spurling points out that it  has  been  accepted  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge that the parties are  living  together  in  a
    genuine marriage in a relationship which has lasted at least since 2012
    if not earlier and that the parties intend living permanently together.
     However it is accepted, that the Appellant and  her  husband  did  not
    meet the minimum income requirements for Appendix FM  at  the  time  of
    decision and still could not do  so  at  the  time  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing.

18. In her determination the First-tier Tribunal Judge at paragraphs 16  to
    18 gave due consideration to the question of whether or not there  were
    "insurmountable obstacles to family life with Mr Dar continuing in  the
    Ukraine."  The judge found that the security situation and the level of
    racism in the Ukraine were not insurmountable objects and came  to  the
    conclusion that there were not insurmountable obstacles to family  life
    with Mr Dar continuing outside the UK.  The judge also found that if Mr
    Dar did not accompany his wife to the  Ukraine  the  interference  with
    family life was proportionate because it would be limited to the period
    necessary  to  enable  the  Appellant  to  make  an   entry   clearance
    application from the Ukraine.

19. It was against that background that I found that there was  a  material
    error of law and set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  As
    set out above the issue is now proceeding by way  of  submissions.   Mr
    Spurling submits that the real issue is a  factual  one  and  that  the
    court is required to assess whether requiring a non-EU citizen to leave
    the territory of the union would oblige the EU citizen to  leave  also.
    If so, it will have the effect of  depriving  the  EU  citizen  of  the
    "genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred  by  virtue
    of his status as a citizen of the union".   Mr  Spurling  continues  by
    stating that the First-tier Tribunal's error was its failure to  decide
    on the balance of probabilities whether the Appellant's  husband  would
    be compelled to leave with her if she were required to  return  to  the
    Ukraine and the reasons for and consequences of his  decision  whatever
    it may be.  He submits that  if  the  motives  and  consequences  of  a
    decision to leave relate to mere desirability or preference  i.e.  that
    they relate to obstacles that, although  they  may  be  unwelcome,  are
    nonetheless reasonably surmountable by the Appellant  then  the  Sanade
    line  of  cases  does   not   identify   anything   relevant   to   the
    "insurmountable obstacles test".  However he considers that  where  the
    reasons for a decision to leave cannot reasonably be  characterised  as
    relating to mere desirability or preference then he  contends  that  EU
    constitutional rights (as identified in the Sanade line of  cases)  are
    relevant to the insurmountable obstacles test and that in  the  instant
    case the judge had failed to make a finding about whether or not Mr Dar
    would accompany his wife to the Ukraine,  what  the  reasons  were  for
    whether he would stay or go and whether  they  amounted  to  choice  or
    compulsion.

20. He submits that Mr Dar is dependent upon his  wife,  both  economically
    and emotionally.  He acknowledges that he can survive  economically  in
    her absence because he is entitled to benefits but he cannot reasonably
    be expected to do so without her emotional support which he contends is
    obviously a matter of fundamental importance to him.  Consequently  the
    practical effect he contends of the Appellant having to return  to  the
    Ukraine is whether or not Mr Dar will go there with her  or  stay  here
    without her.  His contention is that, in ordinary language, that is not
    a matter of choice or mere fact of what is desirable but  a  matter  of
    compulsion which affects Mr Dar's "genuine enjoyment of  the  substance
    of the rights conferred by virtue of his status as  a  citizen  of  the
    union" and accordingly he submits that seen through the  prism  of  his
    European constitutional rights there are  insurmountable  obstacles  in
    this case.

21. Mr Spurling acknowledges that the question is what does  "choice"  mean
    but submits that in  this  instant  case  bearing  in  mind  where  the
    Appellant would have to return to that the choice of living together is
    effectively a matter of compulsion and it is necessary to look  at  the
    reasons why a British citizen would want to move to the Ukraine and  he
    submits that that must be more than just choice but an ability to carry
    on his life there.  Ultimately he submits the question is  can  Mr  Dar
    live in the Ukraine.  He submits that in this instant case  bearing  in
    mind where the Appellant would return to  is  a  matter  of  compulsion
    rather than choice.

22. He takes me to the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  determination  pointing
    out that at paragraph 16 Judge Braybrook considered  the  issue  as  to
    where the Appellant lived noting that it  was  very  near  the  Russian
    border  and  pointing  out  that  whilst  reference  is  made  to   the
    Appellant's sister her  sister  is  in  fact  a  Russian  citizen.   He
    acknowledges that at paragraph 70 Judge Braybrook did not consider  the
    current security situation in the east of Ukraine or  the  threat  from
    Russia to be an insurmountable obstacle to Mr Dar living there  but  he
    contends  that  factually  the  judge  was  wrong  in  coming  to  that
    conclusion based on the evidence.

23. Mr Spurling turns then to the second issue namely whether or not  there
    has been a flawed assessment of the facts relevant  to  the  Article  8
    assessment and the question remains as to what the relevant facts were.
     He reiterates that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  misdirected
    herself as to the effects of Sabir and  SB  (Bangladesh)  and  that  SB
    (Bangladesh)  was  not  authority  for  the  proposition  that  it   is
    irrelevant whether any alternative application under the Rules could or
    could not succeed.  He  contends  that  it  is  not  possible  to  know
    precisely how long it  would  be  before  the  Appellant  can  make  an
    application with reasonable prospects of success.  It  is  possible  he
    contends to know that it will be  at  least  six  months  and  probably
    considerably longer because the Sponsor  has  not  been  able  to  find
    durable employment at the level of income for at  least  the  last  two
    years.  He submits that if the Appellant and her husband are forced  to
    move to the Ukraine together the likelihood of earning an annual income
    of ï¿½18,600 and thus being able  to  return  becomes  considerably  more
    remote because the employment prospects and costs of living  there  are
    much lower than in the UK.  He submits that this is of relevance as  it
    goes to interference with the Appellant's private and family life.   He
    points out that the Appellant has been offered a job as an  interpreter
    which would produce for her an income in excess of the  ï¿½18,600  limit.
    He accepts at present the Appellant does not get past  the  Immigration
    Rules test as her earnings potential cannot be taken into  account  but
    that it is relevant to the Article 8 assessment and  he  refers  me  to
    references  within  the  Appellant's  bundle  as  to  the   Appellant's
    prospects  of  employment  and  that  her  prospective   employer   has
    previously given evidence in this matter.   He  acknowledges  that  the
    test is not one of undue harshness and that that would  only  apply  if
    this were an asylum case.  He asked me to allow the appeal.

24. In response Mr Duffy says that the correct approach is, he acknowledges
    following guiding case law, to look at the  concept  of  insurmountable
    obstacles but absent those it is a matter of choice  and  that  if  the
    test cannot be met it does not become a matter of choice.  Consequently
    even if the obstacles are not in the circumstances reasonably described
    as insurmountable that  is  only  one  material  fact  in  the  overall
    exercise.  He points out that the test set out in  VW  (Uganda)  v  The
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ  5  is  that
    the test is more than one of mere hardship.  Mr Duffy acknowledges that
    the case rises and falls on what constitutes  insurmountable  obstacles
    pointing out that "if you do not succeed under the Rules  the  guidance
    is that  you  are  not  likely  to  succeed  outside  the  Rules."   He
    acknowledges that paragraph EX.1 addresses the issue with regard to the
    test under Chikwamba as the Appellant does not meet the Rules then that
    cannot be the basis of an Article 8 claim.  If that were  the  case  he
    submits that there would be no point in having the Rules in  the  first
    place and that the test for insurmountable obstacle should be one  that
    involves proportionality.  He  acknowledges  that  each  case  is  fact
    sensitive but that there must be an element of consistency and  submits
    that the fact that the Appellant is a British citizen or that  he  does
    not wish to work in the  Ukraine  does  not  in  itself  constitute  an
    insurmountable obstacle.  He  does  acknowledge  that  if  the  British
    citizen was unable to integrate to the place that he would be  returned
    then that could constitute an insurmountable obstacle.

The Law

25. I start by first considering whether the Appellant is able  to  benefit
    under the applicable provisions of the Immigration  Rules  designed  to
    address Article 8 claims and where the Appellant does  not  meet  those
    requirements it is necessary for me to go on to make an  assessment  of
    Article 8 applying the criteria established by case law.   The  correct
    approach was originally set out in Gulshan (Article 8  -  new  Rules  -
    correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC).   That  was  the  approach  to
    appeals involving both Article 8 and the new Immigration Rules.   There
    is was found that the term  "insurmountable  obstacles"  in  provisions
    such as  Section  EX.1  are  not  obstacles  which  are  impossible  to
    surmount, they concern the practical possibilities of  relocation.   In
    the absence of such insurmountable obstacles it is  necessary  to  show
    other non-standard and particular features demonstrating  that  removal
    will be unjustifiably harsh.

26. In Haleemudeen v The Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 558 Beatson LJ held that where the Article 8 ECHR  element  of
    the Immigration Rules is not met refusal would normally be  appropriate
    but that leave can be granted where exceptional  circumstances  in  the
    sense of unjustifiably harsh  consequences  for  the  individual  would
    result.

27. It is no longer relevant to consider whether there  are  insurmountable
    objects to the family enjoying family life elsewhere.  VW (Uganda)  and
    AV (Somalia) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 5 established that the test is  not
    whether there are insurmountable obstacles but whether it is reasonable
    to expect the United Kingdom based person to move to another country.

28. In R (On the application of Agyarko) [2015] EWCA Civ 440  it  was  held
    that the "insurmountable obstacles" criterion is used in the  Rules  to
    define one of the preconditions set out in EX.1(v) which  needs  to  be
    satisfied before an applicant can claim to be entitled  to  be  granted
    leave to remain under the Rules.  In that context, it is not  simply  a
    factor to be taken into account.  However in the context  of  making  a
    wider Article 8 assessment outside the Rules it is a factor to be taken
    into account not an absolute requirement which has to be  satisfied  in
    every single case across the whole range covered by Article 8.

29. Regina (Agyarko) set out  that  the  test  as  to  whether  there  were
    'insurmountable obstacles' to a couple  continuing  their  family  life
    outside the UK was a stringent one.  It was more demanding than a  mere
    test of whether it would be reasonable to expect them to continue their
    family life outside the UK, although it was also to be interpreted in a
    sensible and practical rather than a purely literal way.

Findings

30. The Sponsor, it is accepted, cannot  meet  the  financial  requirements
    that are required under the  Appendix  FM  -  SE.   The  appellant  has
    applied to remain under the Rules.  In order to be allowed to  stay  on
    family  life  grounds  she  would  have  to   show   there   would   be
    insurmountable  obstacles.   Insurmountable  obstacles  as  defined  in
    Section Ex2 of Appendix FM  means  the  very  significant  difficulties
    which would be faced by the appellant  or  her  partner  in  continuing
    family life together outside the UK and which could not be overcome  or
    would entail very serious hardship for the appellant or her partner.

31. This case is fact specific.  The issue turns entirely on whether or not
    there are insurmountable  obstacles  that  would  prevent  the  Sponsor
    returning with the Appellant to her home in the Ukraine.  The Appellant
    comes from the east near Donetzk.  It is not disputed by the  Secretary
    of State that that is close to or even within the war zone.   The  fact
    that the Appellant's sister has Russian citizenship is  not  challenged
    either by the Secretary of State.  I have had  the  benefit  of  having
    both  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  before  me.   Their  financial
    circumstances and their emotional  connection  is  not  challenged.   I
    accept the evidence that it is not possible nor practical for Mr Dar to
    move to the Ukraine.

32. The appeal sets out clearly the basis  upon  which  a  claim  based  on
    insurmountable  obstacles  is  maintained.   The   test   is   one   of
    proportionality.   I  have  given  due  consideration  to  the  factual
    circumstances and in particular to the issues relating to the emotional
    health of Mr Dar.  I am satisfied that he  is  not  someone  who  could
    return with the Appellant to the Ukraine.  In such circumstances  I  am
    satisfied that he has an element of vulnerability but that  this  alone
    does not mean that he must succeed.  It is just one of the  factors  to
    be considered and that I am required to carry out a  balanced  judgment
    of what can reasonably be expected in the light  of  all  the  material
    facts.  As the Court of Appeal have said in Agyarko the  interpretation
    of insurmountable obstacles must be practical and sensible.   The  fact
    is that Mr Dar is a vulnerable  person  with  emotional  instabilities.
    His ability at present to earn is limited.  The  Appellant  can  obtain
    work as an interpreter and documentary evidence in support of  that  is
    not challenged.  The Appellant has stated that she could  not  relocate
    to Kiev.  Even if she could it is not, I find, reasonable to expect  Mr
    Dar to go there anymore than it is reasonable for him to go to  Donetzk
    albeit that clearly the closer he is to the war zone the  more  exposed
    to serious risk both he and the Appellant would be.  The  Secretary  of
    State no longer challenges the validity of the marriage.

33. In all the circumstances this is one of those exceptional cases where I
    am satisfied that it would not be possible for the Sponsor to integrate
    into the Ukraine and the result of refusing this  appeal  would  be  to
    separate the Appellant from the Sponsor in a  manner  that  it  becomes
    almost impossible for them to reunite in the UK.  In such circumstances
    for all the above reasons I am satisfied that this  is  an  exceptional
    case and that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  which  cannot  be
    overcome and the Appellant's claim pursuant to  the  Immigration  Rules
    succeeds.
