Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Wells (LR)
For the Respondent:    Mrs H Aboni (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Sri Lanka, who was born  on  26th
    November 1985.  He appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the
    decision  of  the  Respondent  dated  23rd  April  2015  refusing   his
    application for a residence card on the basis of being a dependant upon
    his brother, Mohamed Jiffrey, an EEA national exercising treaty  rights
    in the United Kingdom.

 2. Given that much of the Appellant's case rested upon the assertion  that
    his brother had been providing the Appellant with ï¿½200 on visits to Sri
    Lanka, for which there was no documentary evidence, the  judge  applied
    the country guidance case  of  ST  (Corroboration  -  Kasolo)  Ethiopia
    [2004] UKIAT 00119 (at paragraph 27) so as to be clear in his mind that
    corroboration was not necessary for  a  positive  credibility  finding.
    The judge then went on to make findings of fact (at paragraph 28).  The
    judge ruled that there was no prior dependency by the Appellant and  he
    had not established prior membership of the  brother's  household  (see
    paragraph 29).  The appeal was dismissed.

 3. At the hearing before me, Mr  J  Wells,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant, drew the Tribunal's attention to a preliminary issue,  which
    was that following the  Tribunal  decision  in  Sala  (EFM:  Rights  of
    Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411, which was promulgated on 16th  August  2016,
    there was no longer a right of appeal available for EU family  members.
    Given that the determination of Judge Green  was  promulgated  on  25th
    January 2016, and the grant of permission was dated 4th July 2016,  and
    the Rule 24 response was dated 7th July 2016, it  was  inevitable  that
    there would be no reference  to  the  case  of  Sala.   Mr  Wells  did,
    however, also add that whereas Sala itself was not  being  appealed  to
    the Court of Appeal, other cases were in the  pipeline  to  appeal  the
    ruling that no rights of appeal any longer existed.

 4. For her part, Mrs Aboni submitted that Sala was good law.  There was no
    right of appeal.  Whether or  not  the  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently
    changed the position adopted by the Tribunal remained to be  seen,  but
    at the moment there was no right of appeal.

 5.  Mr  Wells,  nevertheless,  went  on  to  make  the   following   three
    submissions, and invited me to proceed on the basis  that  a  right  of
    appeal did  exist.   First,  he  submitted  that  the  judge,  although
    referring to the case of ST (Corroboration -  Kasolo)  Ethiopia  [2004]
    UKIAT 00119, had then not applied the strictures of this  decision  (at
    paragraph 27) to the evidence that the Appellant had put forward, which
    was that the monies that he had received could not all be  corroborated
    with documentary evidence.  Second, he submitted  that  the  judge  had
    overlooked the oral testimony of the Appellant and his brother  because
    at paragraph 11(12) there was both oral and written evidence  available
    for the judge to consider.  Third, the judge applied the wrong standard
    of proof at paragraphs 28(iv) and 28(vi).

 6. Mrs Aboni submitted that this was nothing more than a disagreement with
    the decision of the Tribunal.  First, the judge did not  overlook  oral
    evidence.  He was plainly aware of the Appellant's case and  the  judge
    was alive to this issue because he went on to conclude that,  "however,
    the fact that corroboration was not  required  did  not  mean  that  an
    Adjudicator was required  to  leave  out  of  account  the  absence  of
    documentary evidence, which could reasonably  be  expected"  (paragraph
    27).  That conclusion was open to the judge and could not be faulted.

 7. Second, the judge had given clear reasons (at paragraph 28) as  to  why
    the  evidence  did  not  suggest  that  the  Appellant  was   receiving
    sufficient funds to enable him to meet his  essential  needs.   He  had
    ruled that the Appellant had established a rice mill business  in  June
    2015 with another partner and the judge did not accept the  Appellant's
    averment that the business did  not  generate  sufficient  income  from
    which he could make a living (see paragraph 28(iv)).

 8. On this basis, the judge was able to conclude that there was  no  prior
    dependency of the Appellant upon his brother, and any money he may have
    received was paid intermittently over a thirteen year period (paragraph
    29(i)).  What the Appellant was seeking to argue was that the judge was
    bound to come to the opposite conclusion simply  because  of  the  oral
    testimony of the Appellant and his witnesses.  This did not follow.

My Consideration of the Appeal

 9. I am satisfied that this Tribunal does not have  jurisdiction  to  hear
    the Appellant's appeal given what has been ruled in Sala  (EFM:  rights
    of appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 because the Appellant is the family member
    of an EU national.

10. Second, even were there to be jurisdiction, I am equally clear that for
    the reasons given by the Respondent's representative, Mrs Aboni,  today
    before this Tribunal, the Appellant cannot  succeed  because  what  has
    been said is simply a mere disagreement with  the  conclusions  of  the
    judge.  The judge was absolutely clear in paragraphs 27, 28 and  29  of
    the refusal letter in explaining why the Appellant  could  not  succeed
    and in showing why there was no prior dependency or prior membership of
    the household of the EU national.  That conclusion was entirely open to
    the judge on the basis of the evidence that was heard.

11. The judge considered the evidence as a whole and did not disregard  any
    particular aspect of the evidence, but took it  all  into  account,  in
    coming to a reasoned and considered view such that there is no error of
    law at all.

Notice of Decision

12. This appeal is dismissed.

13.  No anonymity direction is made.
