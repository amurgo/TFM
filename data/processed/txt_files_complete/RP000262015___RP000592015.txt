For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal comes back before me following a hearing on  4  April  2016
    which resulted in my finding that the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") erred
    in law in its consideration of an appeal by  the  appellant  against  a
    decision to make a deportation order, and whereby the FtT dismissed the
    appeal.  I set aside the decision of the FtT and directed that there be
    a re-making of the decision in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. I set out the error of law decision in full as follows:

                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

          1. The appellant is a citizen of Rwanda, born on  2  April  1984.
             He arrived in the UK on 19 March 1998, then aged 13, with  his
             sister.  He was granted refugee status and indefinite leave to
             remain ("ILR") on 21 September 1998.  The appellant's ILR  and
             refugee status were  granted  on  the  basis  that  he  was  a
             dependant on his sister's claim.

          2. The appellant has committed a number of criminal offences.  On
             7 March 2002 he was convicted in  the  Crown  Court  at  Inner
             London of two counts of robbery, and  on  15  April  2002  was
             sentenced to a term  of  four  years'  detention  in  a  young
             offenders' institution.

          3. On 11 May 2006 a decision to make a deportation order was made
             against him.  The appellant's appeal against that decision was
             dismissed on or about 21 March  2007.   A  signed  deportation
             order was made on 4 June 2007.  On 25  February  2008  he  was
             convicted in  the  Magistrates'  Court  of  possession  of  an
             offensive  weapon,  receiving  a   sentence   of   120   days'
             imprisonment.  On 30 May 2014 the deportation  order  dated  4
             June 2007 was revoked.

          4. A number of decisions made by the respondent were the  subject
             of an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT").  The first on
             29 April 2015 was a decision to cease the appellant's  refugee
             status  with  reference  to  Article  1C(5)  of  the   Refugee
             Convention and paragraph 339A(v)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
             The second was a decision on 18 May 2015 to make a deportation
             order against him pursuant to s.5(1) of  the  Immigration  Act
             1971 ("the 1971 Act").   The  appellant  lodged  a  notice  of
             appeal in respect of those  decisions.   The  respondent  also
             issued  a  certificate  under  s.72(2)  of  the   Nationality,
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") to the effect
             that the  appellant  had  been  convicted  of  a  particularly
             serious crime and constituted a danger to the community of the
             United Kingdom.

          5. Subsequently, on 5 August 2015, a further decision  was  made,
             being a decision to  refuse  a  protection  and  human  rights
             claim, with reference being made in that decision to the  s.72
             certificate, the cessation of  refugee  status  under  Article
             1C(5) and, notably, the decision to make a  deportation  order
             pursuant to s.5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971.

          6. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross ("the FtJ") upheld all  of  the
             respondent's decisions, that is to say, cessation  of  refugee
             status, the s.72 certificate and the deportation decision, and
             rejecting the human rights arguments.

          7. It appears that  initially  the  proceedings  before  the  FtJ
             related to the  decision  to  cease  refugee  status  and  the
             decision to deport the appellant, those decisions being  dated
             29 April 2015 and 18 May 2015, respectively.

          8. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal refer to the  fact
             that at the hearing before the FtJ an application on behalf of
             the appellant was made for an adjournment to allow  the  other
             proceedings, which were listed separately, being the  decision
             to refuse a protection and human rights claim,  to  be  joined
             with the proceedings listed before the FtJ.  It seems from the
             grounds  that  the  later  decision  was  listed  for  a  Case
             Management Review hearing on  6  October  2015.   Rather  than
             adjourn the hearing the FtJ decided to incorporate the  second
             set of proceedings in the appeal before him.  He  refused  the
             application for an adjournment.  The grounds contend that  the
             appellant had new representation and required further time  to
             collate further witness evidence.  The grounds  continue  that
             documents were compiled but insufficient notice had been given
             to witnesses, in particular the  appellant's  sister  who  was
             granted refugee status at the same time as the appellant,  and
             the appellant had been confused by  the  numerous  notices  of
             hearing he had received.  It is also said in the grounds  that
             the appellant had applied for an adjournment with a view to  a
             direction requiring the respondent to  produce  the  documents
             submitted to UNHCR requesting  cessation  of  refugee  status.
             The grounds contend that it was plainly not in  the  interests
             of justice to move the second set of  proceedings  forward  to
             the date of hearing on 18 September 2015.

          9. A second ground of complaint relates to the judge having dealt
             with the appeal in deportation terms with reference to s.32 of
             the UK Borders Act 2007 ("the 2007 Act"), because this was not
             the basis upon  which  the  respondent  made  the  deportation
             decision, it having been a decision to deport under  the  1971
             Act.

         10. Furthermore, the appellant in any event had the benefit of  an
             Exception to the automatic deportation provisions, namely that
             he was under 18 at the time of the conviction.

         11. Ground 3 asserts that in terms of the deportation decision, it
             was not correct of the FtJ to state  that  the  appellant  had
             failed to respond to all requests  for  information,  when  in
             fact his former representatives had made representations on 15
             June 2015.

         12. The grounds take issue with the FtJ's conclusions in  relation
             to the s.72 certificate, contending that the FtJ was wrong  to
             conclude that the  appellant's  conviction  for  possessing  a
             knife is a 'particularly serious' crime.  In terms of  whether
             he constitutes a danger to the community, it  is  argued  that
             given the length of time since the appellant's  offences,  the
             FtJ was wrong to conclude that he constituted a danger to  the
             community.

         13. Lastly, it is contended  that  the  FtJ  had  failed  to  give
             appropriate weight to the delay of 13 years between the "index
             offence" and the deportation order being made.  It  is  argued
             that the delay has meant that a "considerably  different  law"
             in respect of deportation applies, including in terms of s.117
             of the 2002 Act and paragraphs 398 and 399 of the  Immigration
             Rules.  Delay is relied on generally in terms of the  decision
             in EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
             [2008] UKHL 41.

         14.  It  is  also  said  that  the  FtJ  failed  to  consider  the
             exceptionality of the case outside the applicable  Immigration
             Rules.

         15. Before me, Mr Melvin relied on the  'rule  24'  response.   He
             submitted that even accepting that the FtJ had wrongly applied
             the automatic deportation provisions  of  the  2007  Act,  the
             outcome would have been the same even under the 1971 Act.

         16. The FtJ had referred to various drug-related  issues  and  the
             appellant's conviction for having an  offensive  weapon.   The
             presumption of deportation under paragraph 396 of the Rules is
             a parallel with the automatic deportation provisions.

         17. It was also submitted on behalf of the  respondent  before  me
             that there was a question  about  whether  the  FtJ  even  had
             jurisdiction to hear an  appeal  in  relation  to  deportation
             given that the decision dated 18 May 2015 indicated  that  the
             appellant had no right of appeal, and a deportation order  had
             already been made against him.  However, it was accepted  that
             examination of the decision letter, and  its  reference  to  a
             's.120 notice' made the position in that  regard  rather  more
             uncertain.

         18. In any event, immediately after the hearing and on the day  of
             the hearing Mr Melvin very helpfully provided  information  to
             the Tribunal in relation to the decision of 5 August  2015  to
             refuse a protection and human rights claim.  In  the  covering
             letter it is accepted on behalf of  the  respondent  that  the
             appellant was given a right of appeal  against  that  decision
             and in those circumstances the submissions to the effect  that
             there was no jurisdiction in the FtT  to  consider  the  other
             matters were withdrawn.

         19.  As  indicated  above,  the  appellant  appeared   before   me
             unrepresented.  He was not equipped to make submissions on the
             error of law issues.  He did however, explain why he  felt  he
             should not be returned to Rwanda, in terms of  his  appearance
             and how he would be treated on return,  and  referred  to  his
             family in the UK.

             My conclusions

         20. For reasons explained below, I am satisfied that the FtJ erred
             in law such as to  require  the  decision  to  be  set  aside.
             However, I am not satisfied that there is  merit  in  all  the
             grounds before me, such that  certain  aspects  of  the  FtJ's
             decision are not vitiated  by  any  error  of  law.   I  shall
             explain first the respect in which I  am  not  satisfied  that
             there is any error of law.

         21. I am not satisfied that there is any error of law in the FtJ's
             decision to deal with what could be described as both sets  of
             proceedings at the same time, bringing  the  later  appeal  in
             respect of the refusal of  the  protection  and  human  rights
             claim forward to be heard together with the other matters.  As
             the grounds  acknowledge,  given  that  the  two  appeals  had
             overlapping issues, it was appropriate  to  have  the  appeals
             heard at the same time.  Of course, the preference  on  behalf
             of the appellant was for the hearing before the FtJ  adjourned
             to a later date, but there was no reason in my  judgement,  on
             the facts of this appeal, as to why the hearing listed  for  a
             future date should not have been brought forward.  The grounds
             refer  to  the  appellant  having  new   representatives   and
             requiring time to collate further witness evidence.   However,
             what that further witness evidence was is not explained in the
             grounds.  Reference is made to the need for evidence from  the
             appellant's sister who was granted refugee status at the  same
             time as that of the appellant.  However, the FtJ  pointed  out
             at [17] that no further information was  provided  as  to  the
             whereabouts of the appellant's sister or why her evidence  was
             relevant.  The grounds  do  not  themselves  explain  how  the
             appellant was disadvantaged by a lack  of  evidence  from  his
             sister.  As appears from [18] the FtJ gave further time to the
             appellant's representative in order  to  obtain  a  manuscript
             statement from the appellant's partner.

         22. Although the grounds state that the appellant had also applied
             for an adjournment with the view to a direction requiring  the
             respondent  to  produce  the  document  submitted   to   UNHCR
             requesting cessation of refugee status, it is not  clear  from
             the grounds what the importance of the  respondent's  document
             or letter would  have,  as  distinct  from  that  provided  in
             response by the UNHCR.  At [36] the FtJ referred to the  UNHCR
             response and it is a document in the respondent's bundle,  the
             UNHCR letter being dated 7 November 2014.  In the  absence  of
             any explanation as to why, if this is what the grounds  intend
             to mean,  the  document  from  the  respondent  to  UNHCR  was
             significant, I cannot see how the  absence  of  that  document
             prejudiced the appellant in any sense.

         23. Ground 3 contends that the FtJ was incorrect at [42] to  state
             that the appellant had repeatedly failed  to  respond  to  all
             requests for information  in  relation  to  cessation  of  his
             refugee status.  The inaccuracy is said to  lie  in  the  fact
             that  the  appellant's  former  representatives  made  written
             representations on 15 June 2015.  The grounds in that  respect
             are correct, in that written representations were made by  the
             appellant's former representatives on 15 June  2015.   Indeed,
             their letter is in the respondent's bundle  which  would  have
             been before the FtJ.  However, the  grounds  merely  make  the
             assertion that the FtJ  was  wrong  in  his  comment  in  this
             respect, but the grounds do not explain what it is  about  the
             written representations that  the  FtJ  failed  to  take  into
             account.  It is not even clear from the grounds  whether  this
             complaint  relates  to  the  cessation  of   refugee   status,
             deportation, the s.72 certificate  or  the  appellant's  human
             rights, all of which are referred to, to a greater  or  lesser
             extent, in the written representations  dated  15  June  2015.
             Without the grounds particularising what it is that the FtJ in
             this respect had failed to take into  account,  I  cannot  see
             that what is  essentially  therefore  said  to  be  a  factual
             mistake, amounts to an error of law.

         24. For the avoidance of doubt, it is to be noted that so  far  as
             cessation of refugee status is concerned, at [40] the FtJ said
             that it was accepted by the appellant and not  argued  to  the
             contrary that the situation in Rwanda is no longer  such  that
             there is a risk of persecution.   He  referred  to  the  UNHCR
             letter in response to the notification by  the  respondent  of
             intention to cease the appellant's refugee status, in which it
             is accepted that the refugee status of  Rwandan  refugees  who
             fled the country between 1995 and 1998 as a result  of  inter-
             ethnic violence can now be brought to an end pursuant  to  the
             cessation  clauses  of  the  Refugee  Convention  and  related
             international instruments.

         25. As regards the complaint in the grounds  in  relation  to  the
             FtJ's conclusions on the  s.72  certificate,  it  is  said  at
             [4(a)] that the FtJ had stated that the appellant's conviction
             for possession of a knife is particularly  serious  given  the
             previous conviction.  This complaint is misconceived.  At [48]
             the FtJ characterised the offences  of  robbery  in  2002  for
             which  the  appellant  received  a  sentence  of  four  years'
             detention as constituting a particularly  serious  crime,  for
             the reasons he explained in that paragraph.  The reference  to
             possession of a knife is in [50] whereby the FtJ  referred  to
             the appellant having  continued  to  commit  serious  offences
             after his release from his long period of  detention,  stating
             that the possession of a knife with an  eight  inch  blade  is
             particularly serious, given  his  previous  conviction  for  a
             robbery involving weapons and extreme violence.

         26. There is nothing objectionable in the judge's characterisation
             of  the  appellant's  possession   of   a   knife   in   those
             circumstances as being  particularly  serious.   More  to  the
             point, it is plainly not the case that the FtJ  regarded  this
             as a particularly serious crime with  reference  to  the  s.72
             certificate, as I have explained.  It was however, relevant to
             the question of whether the appellant represented a danger  to
             the community.

         27. That assessment took  into  account  that  the  appellant  had
             continued to commit crimes and, as explained at [51], had  not
             stopped  taking  cannabis,   which   had   resulted   in   his
             experiencing psychotic  episodes  which  in  turn  had  caused
             direct or potential harm to members of the public.  Indeed, as
             the FtJ pointed out, in August 2015  the  appellant  assaulted
             someone in a random attack in those circumstances.

         28. There is  no  error  of  law  in  any  respect  in  the  FtJ's
             assessment of the s.72 certificate.

         29. However, it is clear that the FtJ erred in law in  considering
             the 'deportation appeal' with reference to s.32(5) of the 2007
             Act - automatic deportation.  That was self-evidently not  the
             basis upon which the respondent made the decision,  it  having
             been a decision to make a deportation order under the 1971 Act
             as being conducive to the public good.

         30. In principle, I do not accept that it is  any  answer  to  say
             that the outcome would have inevitably been the same  had  the
             FtJ  considered  the  appeal  within  the  correct   statutory
             framework.  That may or may not be the case, but it is in  any
             event not the point, as explained further below.

         31. Furthermore, I do not consider that the UK Borders  Act  could
             have applied in any event, given the date  of  the  conviction
             which is relied on as  prompting  the  decision  to  make  the
             deportation order.  The appellant was convicted of the robbery
             offences in 2002.  That is plainly well before the passing  of
             the 2007 Act.  If authority is needed for the proposition that
             the provisions of the 2007 Act do  not  apply  to  convictions
             arising before it  was  passed,  I  need  only  refer  to  the
             decision in AT (Pakistan) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
             Department [2010] EWCA Civ 567.

         32. Over and above what I have  already  said,  there  is  another
             reason for the FtJ having erred in law, even if the  2007  Act
             had applied.  That is because at the time of the  offences  of
             robbery which prompted the deportation decision, the appellant
             was under the age of 18.  Under s.33(3) an  Exception  applies
             where the Secretary of State thinks that the foreign  criminal
             was (just) under the age of 18 on the date of  conviction,  as
             this appellant plainly was  and  as  the  Secretary  of  State
             equally plainly knew.

         33. The 2007 Act reflects the heightened public  interest  in  the
             deportation   of   foreign   criminals,   expressed    through
             Parliament.  To the argument that that statutory regime  would
             or could make no difference to the outcome of the  appeal,  is
             the rhetorical question of why the legislation was  passed  in
             the first place if it contained nothing different  or  new  in
             terms of the approach to deportation.  I do  not  consider  it
             necessary to  elaborate  further  on  the  importance  of  the
             application  of  the  correct   statutory   framework   to   a
             deportation appeal.

         34. In the light of the error of law on the part  of  the  FtT  in
             terms of the  applicable  statutory  regime  relating  to  the
             appellant's deportation, it seems to me to be inevitable  that
             the conclusions in relation to Article 8,  whether  within  or
             outside the deportation Immigration Rules, must equally be  in
             error.  Apart from anything else, the FtJ stated at [73]  that
             "The failure to meet  the  requirements  of  Statute  and  the
             Immigration Rules  is  determinative  of  the  proportionality
             assessment under Article 8".  The  FtJ  squarely  related  the
             application of the 2007 Act to the  issue  of  proportionality
             under Article 8.

         35. To summarise therefore, the FtJ did not  err  in  law  in  his
             consideration of cessation of refugee status, or  in  relation
             to the s.72 certificate.  However, he did err in  law  in  the
             consideration of the deportation  issue  and  the  appellant's
             human rights claim which flows from that decision.  Having set
             aside that aspect of  the  FtJ's  decision,  it  requires  re-
             making.

         36. I do not consider it appropriate for the matter to be remitted
             to the FtT, having considered the Senior President's  Practice
             Statement at paragraph 7.2.  The decision can  be  re-made  in
             the Upper  Tribunal  for  which  a  further  hearing  will  be
             required.

         37. The appellant  is  presently  unrepresented.   Therefore,  the
             directions I make below, which the appellant must have careful
             regard  to,  reflect  the  fact  that  he   is   not   legally
             represented.

                                 DIRECTIONS

          1) It is noted that the appellant arrived about  two  hours  late
             for the above hearing before me.  He must ensure that he makes
             arrangements to be  present  at  the  next  hearing  on  time,
             failing which it is likely that the proceedings will  proceed,
             or start, without him.

          2) The appellant must make sure that any witnesses he proposes to
             rely on in support of his appeal attend the next hearing,  and
             that they attend on time.

          3) The appellant must bring  to  the  hearing  3  copies  of  any
             documents that he wishes to rely on.

          4) On the next occasion consideration will be given to the  issue
             of what findings of fact made by the First-tier  Tribunal  can
             be preserved.

 3. At the resumed hearing before me on 23  September  2016  there  was  no
    appearance by or on behalf of the appellant.  It was not expected  that
    any representative would attend because the appellant hitherto had been
    unrepresented  in  the  Upper  Tribunal.   I  was  satisfied  that  the
    appellant had been given notice of the time and place of  the  hearing,
    to the address provided to the Tribunal.   No  messages  were  received
    from the appellant prior to or on the day of the hearing indicating  he
    that was, for some  reason,  unable  to  attend.   There  had  been  no
    application for an adjournment by the appellant prior to the hearing.

 4. Mr Kandola provided me with the appellant's PNC printout  which  states
    that the appellant is wanted for breach  of  a  court  order,  being  a
    restraining order, the breach  described  as  being  in  terms  of  his
    attending the "victim's" home address on 2 August  2016.   I  was  also
    provided with the CID Notes printout which indicates that the appellant
    has not been reporting to the immigration authorities as required.

 5. I took into account that there was medical evidence, referred to in the
    decision of the FtT, to the effect that in the past the  appellant  had
    been admitted to psychiatric hospitals, on two occasions suffering from
    psychotic episodes, seemingly due to use of cannabis.   However,  there
    was nothing to indicate that the appellant was unable to attend  before
    me by reason of any mental health issue.

 6. In the circumstances, I decided to proceed  with  the  hearing  in  the
    absence of the appellant pursuant to rule 38 of the Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

 7. Mr Kandola indicated that as far as he was aware the appellant had  not
    been convicted of any further criminal offences since the last hearing,
    or indeed the hearing before the FtT.  He relied  on  the  respondent's
    decision letter dated  5  August  2015.   It  was  submitted  that  the
    appellant did not come within any of the provisions of the  deportation
    Rules so as to be able to resist deportation.  The whole of the Article
    8 enquiry is contained within paragraphs 398 and 399 of the Rules.

    My conclusions

 8. The appellant's circumstances are set out in full in the error  of  law
    decision quoted above.  To summarise, he is a citizen of  Rwanda,  born
    on 2 April 1984.  He arrived in the UK when he was  aged  13  with  his
    sister.  He was granted refugee status and indefinite leave  to  remain
    ("ILR") on 21 September 1998.

 9. His offending history, taken from  the  decision  letter  and  the  PNC
    printout is as follows:

       . On 11 August 2000, assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed
         on 2 December 1999, receiving a sentence of a conditional discharge
         for twelve months with compensation in the sum of �200.

       . Theft (shoplifting) on 22 June 2001, convicted  on  27  June  2001,
         receiving a fine of �50 and costs.

       . Two offences  of  robbery  committed  on  3  November  2001,  being
         convicted on 15 April 2002, resulting in a sentence of four  years'
         detention in a young offenders' institute.

       . On 24 April 2007, cautioned for possession of ammunition without  a
         certificate.

       . On 25 February 2008, convicted of possession of an offensive weapon
         in a public place, resulting in  imprisonment  of  120  days,  that
         offence being committed on 25 January 2008.

10. As can be seen from the error of law decision, a  number  of  decisions
    have been taken by the respondent in respect of the  appellant.   These
    can be seen from  [4]-[5]  of  that  decision.   The  First-tier  Judge
    ("FtJ") resolved against  the  appellant  the  appeal  in  relation  to
    cessation of refugee status and  in  terms  of  the  certificate  under
    s.72(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the  2002
    Act"), that being to the effect that the appellant had  been  convicted
    of a particularly  serious  crime  and  constituted  a  danger  to  the
    community of the United Kingdom.  Those decisions by the  FtJ  did  not
    involve any error of law and therefore stand.

11. What remains to be resolved is the appeal against the appellant's human
    rights claim, following  the  decision  to  make  a  deportation  order
    against  him.   This  involves  a  consideration  of  the   deportation
    Immigration Rules, in particular paragraph 398 and s.117A-C of the 2002
    Act.

12. Although I found that the FtJ had erred in law in certain respects,  he
    nevertheless made certain findings of fact which are  not  infected  by
    any error of law.  In addition,  it  seems  to  me  that  some  of  the
    evidence before the FtT, either in oral or  documentary  form,  is,  or
    was, uncontested.  I set out below what  that  evidence  is,  and  what
    findings were made by the FtJ, with paragraph numbers of  his  decision
    in square brackets.  The evidence before the FtJ, and before  me  which
    does not appear to be disputed is as follows:

      i) The appellant has a son from a "previous relationship" who was aged
         14 years at the date of the hearing before the FtJ (on 18 September
         2015).  The appellant went to prison when his  son  was  1-year-old
         and has never lived with him since then.  His son was  fostered  as
         his biological mother was unable to look after him.  At the time of
         the hearing before the FtJ his son was in youth detention [21].

     ii) The appellant had never returned to Rwanda and has no contact  with
         anyone there.  His wife, son, sister and brother all  live  in  the
         UK.  His wife was pregnant as at the date of the hearing before the
         FtJ and her baby was due to  be  born  the  following  month.   The
         appellant's wife is Ugandan and has no leave to remain  in  the  UK
         [22].

    iii) The appellant accepted that there was no threat to him currently in
         Rwanda in terms of the genocide that had endured when  he  came  to
         the UK.

     iv) The appellant accepted that the evidence before the Tribunal  in  a
         previous appeal included that he had  shown  violence  towards  his
         sister [25].

      v) The appellant underwent a religious marriage in 2013.  He does  not
         live with his wife, who lives with her sister.   Between  2001  and
         2014 he has never worked and  has  lived  on  unemployment  benefit
         [26].

     vi) The appellant's wife told the appellant when they met that she  was
         present in the UK unlawfully, having overstayed her  student  visa.
         Her evidence was that she would live in Rwanda with the  appellant,
         although her parents are in Ghana.

    vii) In March 2012 the appellant was taken  to  a  psychiatric  ward  by
         police as he was on the street, stripping off,  screaming  that  he
         was Jesus and talking about cutting off his penis.   This  was  the
         appellant's  first  presentation  to  psychiatric  services.    The
         diagnosis was mental  and  behavioural  disorders  due  to  use  of
         cannabinoids [28].

   viii) A further psychotic episode due to the use of cannabis occurred  in
         August 2015.  The discharge summary was  to  the  effect  that  the
         appellant was admitted to Newham Centre for  Mental  Health  on  11
         August 2015 to 20 August 2015.  During the assessment the appellant
         was very uncooperative and appeared very paranoid.  The  collateral
         history from his  brother  was  that  the  appellant  spontaneously
         assaulted a member of the public by pinning him to the  ground  and
         attempting to force feed him some peanuts that he had been  eating.
         The appellant's brother took him to the A & E Department of  Newham
         Hospital.  The police described the appellant as paranoid, rambling
         incoherently and talking about Jesus.

     ix) According to the appellant's brother, as indicated on the discharge
         summary from Newham Centre for Mental  Health,  the  appellant  had
         fallen out with  his  wife  and  is  not  staying  with  her.   The
         appellant had admitted to smoking a lot of cannabis  prior  to  his
         admission.  It also appeared that he was under  significant  stress
         following separation from his wife and also the impending arrest of
         his son who was wanted for assault [31].

      x) The appellant's son was born on 22 October 2001.  At  the  time  of
         the hearing before the  FtT  he  was  in  the  care  of  Wandsworth
         Council, having been removed from his birth mother.  The  appellant
         had contact with his son until mid to end of 2013 apart  from  when
         he was imprisoned or in immigration detention.  He has not had  any
         contact with his son since 2013.

     xi) The FtJ found that the recent medical evidence confirmed  that  the
         appellant had not stopped taking  cannabis,  which  is  the  direct
         cause of his psychotic episodes, which  in  turn  cause  direct  or
         potential harm to members of the public.   As  recently  as  August
         2015 he assaulted someone in a random attack [51].

    xii) The  appellant  represents  a  present  or  future  danger  to  the
         community in relation to particularly serious offending [52].

   xiii) The appellant has not been his son's primary carer since he was  1-
         year-old and has not had any contact with him since 2013.  His  son
         is in the care of the local  authority  and  at  the  time  of  the
         hearing before the FtJ in youth detention.  The appellant  has  not
         been granted any access rights to his son [63].

    xiv) The appellant's second child with his current wife was due to  have
         been born in October 2015 and is cared for by  the  child's  mother
         who is in the UK unlawfully.  The appellant does not live with  his
         wife or the child [64].

13. There was no further evidence before me to displace any of the findings
    made by the FtJ.

14. The sentencing remarks in relation to the robbery  offences  for  which
    the appellant received a sentence of four  years'  imprisonment  reveal
    that a number of items, including  mobile  telephones,  �500  worth  of
    mobile telephone vouchers and �326 in money were taken from a  shop  in
    Wandsworth.  It  appears  that  the  appellant's  girlfriend  had  been
    dismissed from the shop and  her  employment  terminated.   With  three
    other young men the appellant decided to take revenge on the owner  and
    manager of the shop.  They waited until the shop  was  closed  for  the
    evening, forced their way  into  the  shop  and  terrorised  the  staff
    working  there.   The  appellant   used   a   metal   clip,   used   in
    mountaineering, as a  knuckleduster,  violently  punching  one  of  the
    staff, who was to replace the appellant's girlfriend  as  a  member  of
    staff.  He was punched around the  head  repeatedly.   Another  of  the
    group produced a knife, putting it at the throat of two  of  the  other
    members of staff and forcing them to open the till.  One of  the  staff
    was made to go on his knees with the knife held  at  his  throat.   The
    incident lasted for several minutes and  the  victims  were  threatened
    about not reporting the incident.

15. The sentencing judge said that in  the  appellant's  case  the  extreme
    violence was  motivated  by  revenge  but  also  by  simple  greed  and
    dishonesty.   He  said  that  fortunately  there  were  no  serious  or
    permanent injuries.

16. The judge also said that the appellant had been involved in a  previous
    incident of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a security  guard
    at  the  shopping  centre  in  Wandsworth  for  which  he  received   a
    conditional discharge.  He referred to the appellant having  a  violent
    streak, noting that there had been violence between the  appellant  and
    his sister.  He said that he was prone to use violence  when  provoked.
    The appellant had pleaded not guilty but was convicted by a jury.

17. Paragraph 398 of the Rules provides as follows:

         "398.    Where a person claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
             contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the  Human
             Rights Convention, and

             (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                  the public good because they have  been  convicted  of  an
                  offence for which they have been sentenced to a period  of
                  imprisonment of at least 4 years;

             (b)   the deportation of the person from the UK  is  conducive
                  to the public good and in the public interest because they
                  have been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years
                  but at least 12 months; or

             (c)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                  the public good and in the public interest because, in the
                  view of the Secretary of State, their offending has caused
                  serious harm or they are a persistent offender who shows a
                  particular disregard for the law,

             the Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider
             whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the
             public interest in deportation  will  only  be  outweighed  by
             other factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances
             over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A."

18. S.117C of the 2002 Act further provides as follows:

         "117C:  Article 8: additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
             foreign criminals

             (1)  The deportation of foreign criminals  is  in  the  public
                  interest.

             (2)  The more serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
                  criminal,  the  greater  is   the   public   interest   in
                  deportation of the criminal.

             (3)  In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not  been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  four  years  or
                  more, the public interest requires C's deportation  unless
                  Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.

             (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

                  (a)  C has been lawfully resident in  the  United  Kingdom
                      for most of C's life,

                  (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                      Kingdom, and

                  (c)  there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
                      integration into the country to which C  is  proposed
                      to be deported.

             (5)  Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and  subsisting
                  relationship with a qualifying partner, or a  genuine  and
                  subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying  child,
                  and the effect of C's deportation on the partner or  child
                  would be unduly harsh.

             (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been  sentenced
                  to a period of imprisonment of at least  four  years,  the
                  public interest requires deportation unless there are very
                  compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described
                  in Exceptions 1 and 2.

             (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6)  are  to  be
                  taken  into  account  where  a  court   or   tribunal   is
                  considering a decision to deport a foreign  criminal  only
                  to the extent that the reason for  the  decision  was  the
                  offence or  offences  for  which  the  criminal  has  been
                  convicted."

19. The appellant is not able to resist deportation by reason of any of the
    factors set out in paragraphs 399 or 399A of the Rules because  he  has
    been sentenced to a custodial term of at least four years.  Although he
    was sentenced to a period of detention in a young offenders' institute,
    that is nevertheless a  'qualifying'  sentence  because  "a  period  of
    imprisonment" in the Rules is defined in the Rules as having  the  same
    meaning as set out in s.38(2) of the UK Borders  Act  2007.   That,  in
    short, includes a period of youth detention.

20.  I  must  decide  therefore,  whether  there   are   "very   compelling
    circumstances" over and above those described  in  paragraphs  399  and
    399A of the Rules.

21. There is no evidence that the appellant has a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with any child in the UK.  No  evidence  to  that
    effect was put before me and the findings made by the  FtJ  suggest  to
    the contrary.  He does not live with his 14-year-old son, and  has  not
    lived with him since he was aged 1 year.  He has not  had  any  contact
    with him since 2013.

22. In the absence of any evidence before me in terms of  any  relationship
    with the mother of his eldest child, or indeed with the mother  of  his
    youngest child, I am not satisfied that there is  any  such  subsisting
    relationship.  There is no evidence to indicate that he has any contact
    or relationship with his youngest child.

23. The appellant's private life in the UK has been punctuated by  criminal
    offending, with the lack of any real evidence of any  integration  into
    society in the UK.

24. It is true to say that he has been in the UK for 18 years, and there is
    nothing to indicate that he has returned to  Rwanda  in  the  meantime.
    He has his sister and brother in the UK, although neither of them  gave
    evidence before me.  The appellant does  not  live  with  his  wife  or
    youngest child.

25. So far as the best interests of the appellant's children are concerned,
    generally speaking it is in the best interests of a child to live in  a
    stable family environment with both parents.  However, that is not  the
    present situation with regard to the  appellant  and  his  eldest  son.
    Similarly, nothing before me indicates that he has a relationship  with
    his younger son or lives with the child's mother.  There is no evidence
    of any court order in terms of any contact with his youngest child.

26. The evidence does not indicate that the appellant's  return  to  Rwanda
    would compromise the best interests of either of his  children  in  any
    way.

27. In his witness statement the appellant says that he does not  have  any
    relatives in Rwanda, believing that his parents had been killed.  I  am
    prepared to accept that he has no relatives in Rwanda and would have no
    family support there on return.

28. I have also taken into account that there are  no  further  convictions
    recorded against  the  appellant,  although  the  recent  PNC  printout
    indicates that he is wanted for breach of a restraining order.   It  is
    not clear when, or in what circumstances,  the  restraining  order  was
    made, but the fact that there is a restraining order is indicative of a
    concern about the appellant's continued  risk  of  violence  behaviour.
    That he is wanted for  breach  of  a  restraining  order  is  at  least
    evidence of a reasonable suspicion  that  he  has  flouted  that  court
    order.

29. So far as his private life is concerned, there is some evidence in  the
    bundle that was before the FtT of  his  having  been  involved  with  a
    Christian church up to about 2014.  There is a letter of reference from
    the Victory Family Christian Centre dated 21 April 2013, and  a  letter
    from the Universal Church  of  the  Kingdom  of  God  Help  Centre,  an
    Evangelical Ministry, dated 6 July 2015 which refers to the appellant's
    attendance there at that time on  a  weekly  basis  from  August  2014.
    There are various letters of  personal  reference  in  the  appellant's
    bundle, including from someone who describes herself as the appellant's
    sister-in-law.   It  states  that  she  is  wheelchair  bound  and  the
    appellant has assisted her in various practical ways from time to time,
    although the letter is not dated.

30. Various certificates are included in the bundle from page 35  regarding
    various qualifications that the appellant has achieved, ordered by  the
    City and Guilds, and other organisations.  There are also  certificates
    in sports qualifications.

31. I have considered the Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice for
    Rwanda dated September 2016.  It refers to  Rwanda  being  generally  a
    safe country with crime levels being  relatively  low  although  street
    crime is said to occur.   Various  security  concerns  made  travel  to
    certain areas problematic.  The US State  Department  Report  on  Human
    Rights Practices for Rwanda dated 2015 refers to various  human  rights
    abuses committed by the security forces.  It states that the government
    generally respected the right of freedom of internal  movement.   There
    is no Home Office country information report for Rwanda.

32. The FtJ upheld the s.72 certificate which is to  the  effect  that  the
    appellant has been  convicted  of  a  particularly  serious  crime  and
    constitutes a danger to the community  of  the  United  Kingdom.   That
    finding was made in September 2015.  One year on, although there is  no
    further conviction, there is nothing to displace the  FtJ's  conclusion
    in that respect.  Indeed, the fact that the  appellant  is  wanted  for
    breach of a restraining order  suggests  that  he  still  represents  a
    danger to the community.

33. Nothing in the appellant's circumstances demonstrates  that  there  are
    very compelling circumstances indicating  that  the  deportation  order
    should not be enforced.  The appellant does not even come within any of
    the terms of the Rules which could, were he not sentenced to a term  of
    at least four years'  imprisonment,  have  assisted  him  in  resisting
    deportation.

34. Although the appellant does appear to have suffered from mental  health
    problems in the past, there is nothing to indicate  that  he  presently
    has any mental health issues which would have a bearing on his removal.
     His admissions to hospital for treatment for his mental health  appear
    to have been relatively short-lived.  Furthermore, it appears that  the
    appellant, at least up until the time of the hearing  before  the  FtJ,
    continued to take cannabis, which resulted in the most recent admission
    to a psychiatric hospital.

35. I am not satisfied that the evidence establishes  that  there  are  the
    very compelling circumstances necessary under the  Rules,  to  displace
    the public interest in the appellant's removal.  A consideration of the
    factors in s.117C of the 2002 Act does not indicate a different outcome
    in the material respects with which this appeal is concerned.

36. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal is dismissed.




    Decision

37. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  Its decision having been set aside, I  re-make  the
    decision, dismissing the appeal.
