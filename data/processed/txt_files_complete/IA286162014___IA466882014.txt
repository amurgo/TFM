For the Respondent:    Ms N Willcocks-Briscoe, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Shand QC) dismissing the appellants' appeals against a  decision
    taken on 4 November 2014 to refuse an application for further leave  to
    remain  as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and  dependent  and  to  remove  the
    appellants from the UK.

Introduction

 3. The first appellant is a citizen of  Pakistan  born  in  1983  and  the
    second appellant is his wife, also a citizen of Pakistan born in  1980.
    The appellants have previously been granted leave to remain in  the  UK
    as Tier 1 post study migrants. The applications were made  on  25  July
    2014. With his application the first appellant submitted a letter  from
    Bank Afalah confirming that he held 8.5 million rupees as  of  19  June
    2014 and that was equivalent to more than �50,000. The respondent wrote
    to the  first  appellant  on  25  September  2014  requesting  original
    documents to prove that the funds were still  available.  The  deadline
    was 29 October 2014. The representatives requested an  extension  until
    28 November 2014 and telephone conversations followed on 23 October and
    27 October. The representatives wrote to the respondent on  27  October
    2014 stating that they had been told that if they did not hear anything
    then they were to assume  that  the  extension  had  been  granted  and
    requesting written confirmation of the same. By 3.56pm  on  4  November
    2014 the first appellant had a balance of �51,986.32 in his UK  Natwest
    bank account.

 4.  The  Secretary  of  State  accepted  the  appellants'   identity   and
    nationality but concluded that the first appellant had failed to  prove
    that he still had access to the required funds.

The Appeal

 5. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and attended an oral
    hearing at Hatton Cross on 6 July 2015. They  were  represented  by  Mr
    Abbas. The First-tier Tribunal  found  that  the  first  appellant  had
    failed to submit the required evidence with his application  and  there
    was no obligation on the respondent to grant  an  extension  beyond  29
    October 2014 to produce the documents requested by  the  letter  of  25
    September 2014. The refusal decision was in accordance with the law and
    the Immigration Rules.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Eshun  on  4
    January 2016  on  the  basis  that  it  was  arguable  that  the  judge
    misunderstood that the matter before the First-tier  Tribunal  was  not
    connected to evidential flexibility but to the unfair behaviour of  the
    respondent.

 8. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

 9. Mr Abbas submitted that this was an appeal  where  the  respondent  had
    requested  further  evidence.  Common  law  fairness  was  not  applied
    correctly. There was a promise that a further deadline extension  would
    be granted. The first appellant had  provided  the  required  mandatory
    information at page 28 of the application form.

10. Ms Willcocks-Briscoe submitted that the first  appellant  had  to  show
    that the funds remained available to the appellant. He  had  failed  to
    satisfy the Rules. A deadline was given and the deadline had passed. In
    excess of 28 days was granted. The appeal was adequately considered  by
    the judge in terms of common  law  fairness  at  paragraph  14  of  the
    decision.

11. Mr Abbas submitted in response that the judge had approached the matter
    incorrectly. The judge was unaware that that this  was  a  request  for
    further evidence and  the  respondent  had  agreed  an  extension.  The
    respondent stepped outside her own policy guidelines and it  was  clear
    that an extension was  granted.  The  new  evidence  requested  by  the
    respondent was whether the money was still available. The query was not
    about the documents submitted with the application.

12. I find that the judge did not approach the issue of common law fairness
    correctly. It is not disputed that the  representatives  wrote  to  the
    respondent on 27 October 2014 stating that they had been told to assume
    that the extension to 28 November  2014  had  been  granted.  In  those
    circumstances, it was unfair for the respondent to proceed to  make  an
    adverse decision, particularly as the required funds were available  in
    the UK by 4 November 2014. This is an appeal which is peculiar  to  its
    own facts but it is clear that the  common  law  duty  of  fairness  is
    sufficiently wide to encompass those facts.

13. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the  appellants'
    appeal under the Immigration Rules involved the making of an  error  of
    law and its decision cannot stand.

Decision

14. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    remake the decision by allowing the appeals  to  the  extent  that  the
    respondent's decision of 4 November 2014 was not in accordance with the
    law and no  valid  decision  has  yet  been  made  in  respect  of  the
    applications. A fresh decision must now be made in due course.
