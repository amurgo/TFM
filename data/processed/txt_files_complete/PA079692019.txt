                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Martin, of Jain, Neil & Ruddy, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1.  This  is  an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  FtT  Judge  Handley,
    promulgated on 5 November 2019.

 2. The appellant's two grounds are set out in his application to  the  FtT
    dated 11 November 2019.

 3. The first ground says that the judge erred by not deciding whether  the
    appellant has lived in the UK, as he claims, for 20 years; and that  if
    that had been shown, the  appeal  should  have  been  allowed,  without
    consideration of "insurmountable obstacles"  to  his  reintegration  in
    China.

 4. The second ground alleges error in assessing risk arising from  alleged
    selling of books promoting Tibetan independence and Falun Gong.

 5. The FtT granted permission on 11 December 2019, saying  expressly  that
    ground 1 was arguable, but not restricting its grant.

 6. The FtT said in passing at [45] that the appellant "had been in the  UK
    for around 20 years", but at [49] that he "claims to have lived in  the
    UK for the past 20 years".  There is no discussion of the  evidence  on
    that issue, and the matter is left unresolved.

 7. The point might not have been the entire resolution of  article  8.  Mr
    Govan pointed out that by his own dates the appellant had  not  reached
    the 20 year mark at the date of  his  application,  which  governs  the
    rule, or perhaps even by the date of the hearing - although he had done
    so by the date of promulgation.   However,  I  gave  my  decision  that
    failure to resolve that obviously important issue is an error of law.

 8. Based on that indication, the following outcome was agreed.

 9. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.  (Although ground 2 was not debated, this
    remit is not restricted.)

10. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

11. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Handley.

12. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
