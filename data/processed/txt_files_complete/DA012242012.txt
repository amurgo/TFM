Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Dunlop, Counsel, instructed by Cleveland & Co
Solicitors
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. I see no need to for an anonymity order in this case.

 2. The respondent to this appeal, hereinafter "the claimant", is a  citizen
    of South Africa. He was born on 8 December 1978 and so is now  34  years
    old.  He appealed successfully to the First-tier Tribunal a decision  of
    the present appellant, hereinafter "the Secretary of State", to make him
    the subject of a deportation order.

 3. The Secretary of State was given  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal by First-tier Tribunal Judge Coates on 17 April 2013.

 4. The proper approach to be taken by the Tribunal in cases such as this is
    not uncontroversial and I intend to explain rather  carefully  both  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision and the grounds raised in the  notice  of
    appeal against that decision.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal's determination shows that the claimant appealed
    a decision of the Secretary of State, made on  26  November  2012,  that
    section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applied to this case  and  that
    therefore the  claimant  should  be  deported.  By  this  provision  the
    Secretary of State is obliged to make  a  deportation  order  against  a
    foreign criminal unless certain exceptions apply.

 6. The claimant has been in the United Kingdom since 7 April 1999.  He  has
    had permission to be in the United Kingdom throughout his  stay.  On  19
    December 2001 he  was  given  leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  his
    relationship with his partner who is a British  national.   In  December
    2003 he was given indefinite leave to remain.

 7. On 25 April 2012 he was convicted of two counts of thefts from a  person
    and two counts of fraud by  abuse  of  position  and  was  sentenced  to
    sixteen months' imprisonment concurrently on each count.





 8. The sentencing  judge  (whose  name  does  not  appear  in  the  papers)
    explained that the claimant was a financial controller and accountant in
    a small company that depended on his  performance.   Over  a  period  of
    about six months he dishonestly used a business credit card for personal
    spending in the order of about �32,500 and he took steps to conceal  his
    dishonesty from his employers. He pleaded  guilty,  albeit,  apparently,
    not at the first opportunity.  He paid back �10,000, being all  that  he
    could raise in the time available  to  him,  and  he  was  sentenced  as
    indicated. The judge recognised that  the  appellant's  criminality  may
    have been "exacerbated by undiagnosed mental health issues".





 9. The nub of the First-tier Tribunal's reasons for allowing the appeal was
    given at paragraph 25 which says:




         "The appellant has lived in the  UK  since  1989.  He  has  had  an
         ancestral visa and obtained indefinite leave to remain in the UK as
         the partner of a British  national  in  December  2003.   The  Home
         Office accepted the appellant's relationship with the sponsor  from
         2001 onwards and they are still together. We  were  impressed  with
         the obvious proximity of the relationship between the appellant and
         sponsor which was demonstrated before us. We  found  the  appellant
         and  sponsor  both  to  be  witnesses  of  truth  who  gave  highly
         impressive, credible and consistent evidence before us.  We  accept
         that the relationship between the appellant and  sponsor,  being  a
         committed relationship of approximately fourteen years  in  length,
         is highly indicative of the fact that the  parties  have  a  strong
         family life together.  We  accept  the  appellant's  removal  would
         interfere with that family life.   Further,  the  appellant  has  a
         close relationship with the appellant's family members in  the  UK,
         including his brothers and mother and also  with  his  8  year  old
         godson. The appellant also has large network  of  friends  and  has
         worked in the UK.  He is currently undertaking charitable/voluntary
         activities encouraging youths not to become involved in crime.  The
         appellant has lived in the UK for a  significant  period  of  time,
         being up to fourteen years, and we  find  that  the  appellant  has
         established a strong private life in the UK to  adapt  time  [sic].
         The appellant's removal will be in breach of his rights to a family
         and private life. We  need  to  consider  whether  his  removal  is
         disproportionate in respect of the requirement to maintain law  and
         order."




10. The Tribunal then found there were  "strong  circumstances"  making  the
    removal disproportionate.

11. The Tribunal noted that the appellant had been released on  licence  and
    had undertaken a drugs awareness course in prison and had been  assessed
    as "posing a very low risk of reoffending".   The  Tribunal  found  that
    the appellant posed no risk of reoffending.

12. The Tribunal also accepted that  the  claimant  committed  the  offences
    when he was "undiagnosed bipolar"  and  that  people  who  were  bipolar
    sometimes went on "spending sprees during their manic  period  which  is
    what  the  [claimant]  did".   The  Tribunal  noted  that  he  had  been
    "diagnosed and on appropriate medication".

13. The claimant was also deeply remorseful and had been a model prisoner.

14. The Tribunal noted that the claimant's partner's mother was an  86  year
    old lady who was grand mal epileptic and relied  on  him.   Nevertheless
    the claimant and his partner had considered  removal  to  South  Africa,
    where unemployment was running  at  25%,  and  had  concluded  that  the
    difficulties facing the claimant's partner in obtaining  work  in  South
    Africa and fracturing the relationship  with  the  claimant's  partner's
    mother as well as with  a  godson  and  other  family  members  made  it
    unreasonable to expect relocation in South Africa.   The  Tribunal  also
    found the claimant to be "highly supportive" of his 8 year old godson.

15. The Tribunal took  account  of  the  claimant's  remorse  and  realistic
    intentions of keeping out of trouble, the disruption to the private  and
    family life of the claimant's partner in the event of  removal  and  the
    difficulties of establishing himself in South Africa  and  concluded  in
    all the circumstances that removal was disproportionate.

16. The Tribunal then allowed the  appeal  under  the  Rules  and  on  human
    rights grounds.

17. There were six substantive points taken  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    grounds.

18. Ground 1 is complex and I set it out in full below.

         "The Immigration Judge has failed  to  given  proper  and  adequate
         consideration to the Secretary of State's policies and  has  failed
         to give adequate reasons for finding that the presumption to deport
         the [claimant] does not outweigh the [claimant's] Article 8 private
         and family life rights.  The [claimant] was  sentenced  to  sixteen
         months' imprisonment.  Paragraph 398(b) applies to this [claimant],
         and the [claimant] has not satisfied paragraph  399(a)  or  (b)  of
         339A, therefore it would only be in exceptional circumstances  that
         the public interest in deportation would  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors. The [claimant] has been convicted of  a  serious  offence,
         and although he has now been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, there
         is no independent evidence suggesting that  his  previous  offences
         were a direct result of this disorder.  The Immigration  Judge  has
         failed to identify any exceptional circumstances, the [claimant] is
         not in employment, and his partner's income is  determined  by  the
         clientele he raises and he is willing to relocate to  South  Africa
         if he has to.  While there may be an unusual circumstance it is not
         something that would lead to an unjustifiably harsh outcome and  it
         is submitted that it is therefore not exceptional  such  as  to  be
         disproportionate.  Exceptional in the context of Article 8 and  the
         Immigration Rules means circumstances in which  the  refusal  of  a
         claim would result  in  an  unjustifiably  harsh  outcome  for  the
         appellant.  It is not simply something that does not conform to the
         Rules or something that is unusual.  The [claimant's] godchild  has
         his natural parents to care for him and there is no  evidence  that
         this is a contributory factor that should outweigh the [claimant's]
         deportation."

19. The first part of this ground is uncontroversial.  The claimant is  not,
    and did not claim to be, in a parental relationship with a  minor  child
    in the United Kingdom and the claimant  has  not  lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom for fifteen years.

20. However the ground makes it plain that "therefore it would  only  be  in
    exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation  would
    be  outweighed  by  other  factors".   This  assumes  that   the   Rules
    encapsulate all the circumstances in which  an  appeal  can  be  allowed
    properly with reference to Article 8.  Plainly that was not the view  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  because  the  First-tier  Tribunal  expressly
    allowed the appeal with reference both to the Rules and to human  rights
    grounds.

21. Ground 2 is quite specific and complains that the Tribunal  adopted  the
    approach to Article 8 assessment  that  was  approved  in  MF  (Nigeria)
    [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC). The grounds contend  that  this  is  the  wrong
    approach and that the  requirements  of  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights are reflected properly in the Rules.

22. Ground 3 contends that the Tribunal should not  have  decided  the  case
    outside the Rules.

23. Ground 4 contends the Tribunal decided  the  case  wrongly  outside  the
    Rules by failing to apply show that  removal  was  not  disproportionate
    unless the interference consequent on removal  was  "more  than  a  mere
    hardship or a mere difficulty  or  mere  obstacle".   According  to  the
    grounds this contention was supported by VW (Uganda) v SSHD [2009]  EWCA
    Civ 5.

24. Ground 5 is, I find, a "catch all" ground complaining that the  decision
    was not sufficiently clear.

25. Ground 6 asserts that there was not sufficient reason  for  finding  why
    the claimant's deportation is "not conducive to the  public  good".   It
    also asserts that there was no "evidence  before  the  sentencing  judge
    that the appellant's conviction was linked  to  bipolar  or  indeed  any
    evidence since linking  his  offence  with  his  recent  diagnosis,  the
    respondent did not err by not taking this evidence into consideration".

26. I am aware of the decision in the Court of  Appeal  in  SS  (Nigeria)  v
    SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 550 which was published as recently as 22 May 2013.
    I drew it to the parties' attention but neither sought to rely on it.

27. Mr Walker complained of "an abject failure" to identify any  exceptional
    circumstances. The appeal should not have been allowed under the  Rules.
    He accepted the grounds asserted that the decision in MF  (Nigeria)  was
    wrong.

28. I regard the decision in  MF  (Nigeria)  is  good  law.   I  have  every
    intention of following the published decision of  this  Tribunal  unless
    and until a higher court or an Act of Parliament  tells  me  that  I  am
    wrong.  It follows therefore that I  reject  completely  any  contention
    that the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  wrong  because  it
    considered the case outside the Rules.  I do not make this decision  out
    of blind obedience to authority.  For  my  part  I  think  it  extremely
    unlikely that Rules could ever be  drafted  to  determine  properly  the
    balance between the competing interests of the public good  in  removal,
    the rights of the person to be removed and the rights of  other  persons
    affected by that person's removal.  Each case is very fact specific  and
    I consider it unlikely that the Rules are capable of being drawn in such
    a way as to incorporate  every  possible  permissible  finding  about  a
    person's human rights.  Further I do not consider that  rules  can  ever
    displace an individually assessed human rights  balancing  exercise.  If
    they could then the whole provisions of the Human  Rights  Act  and  the
    Convention could be circumvent by tight  definitions  and  strict  Rules
    that no-one could ever satisfy.

29. I am satisfied the Tribunal was right to make  a  decision  outside  the
    Rules.

30. Mr Dunlop contended that the Tribunal  was  right  to  make  a  decision
    under the Rules.   He  built  this  case  on  the  interesting  argument
    concerning the meaning of "exceptional  circumstances"  under  paragraph
    398.  He said the Secretary of State does not seem to have a  consistent
    understanding of the meaning of  "exceptional  circumstances".   In  the
    case of Izuazu (Article 8 -  new  Rules)  [2013]  UKUT  00045  (IAC)  at
    paragraph 28 the Upper Tribunal recorded that the Secretary of State had
    submitted that the Rules as amended served to restore  the  "exceptional
    circumstances test disapproved by the House of Lords  in  Huang  v  SSHD
    [2007] UKHL 11".  This contrasted rather with the  submissions  of  Miss
    Lisa Giovannetti QC in R (on the application of Nagrev)  v  SSHD  [2013]
    EWHC 720 (Admin) at paragraph 32 that:

         "It is not contended that the effect of the new Rules is to restore
         an exceptional circumstances test equivalent to  that  rejected  by
         the House of Lords in Huang (by reference to  the  old  Immigration
         Rules) and by the Upper Tribunal in Izuazu (by reference to the new
         Rules), by contrast with the position argued unsuccessfully by  the
         Secretary of State in Izuazu: see  [28],  [47]  -  [50]  and  [58].
         Rather, the Secretary of State accepts that  the  consideration  of
         possible Article 8 claims arising outside the new Rules involves  a
         broader consideration of cases by reference to the general  factors
         and approach set out in the new guidance on her residual discretion
         set out above."

31. I have reflected very carefully on this.  I find  that  the  meaning  of
    "exceptional circumstances" is not defined in the Rules and has not been
    determined authoritatively by any Tribunal.

32. Nevertheless as far as  I  can  see  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
    consider exceptionality at all and I do not understand how it managed to
    allow the appeal under the Rules. It  follows  therefore  that  to  that
    limited extent there is clearly an error but it is not  necessarily  one
    which I have to correct.  I see no point whatsoever in interfering  with
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal if the  decision  to  allow  the
    appeal on human rights grounds outside the rules was open to it.

33. I am satisfied that the decision to allow the  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds clearly was open to the Tribunal.  Since Huang  it  has  been  a
    matter for the judges to determine what is proportional  and,  whilst  I
    realise the law  may  change,  it  has  not  changed  yet.   It  follows
    therefore that the First-tier Tribunal  was  entitled  to  find  that  a
    person settled in the United Kingdom with strong community ties who  has
    committed one group of offences for which he has  shown  remorse  should
    not be removed because his deportation would be disproportionate to  the
    public interest in removal. As is so often the case in  appeals  against
    deportation decisions that are allowed on human rights grounds it is the
    rights of persons affected by the claimant's  removal  rather  than  the
    claimant's own rights that guide the decision.

34. I am not persuaded that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  materially  when
    it allowed the claimant's appeal.

35. It follows therefore that I dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal  and
    uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.
