                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the claimant: Mr S Medley-Daley, instructed by Broudie Jackson & Canter
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Ayodele Funmilola Adebayo, date of birth  19.6.68,  is  a
    citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley, who allowed the claimant's appeal
    on human rights grounds against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  to
    refuse her asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims  and
    to remove her from the UK as an illegal entrant.  The Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 6.11.13.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Froom  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    6.12.13.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 22.5.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. In the error of law decision promulgated 27.5.14 I  found  that  whilst
    there was no challenge to and no error in the findings and  conclusions
    of Judge Ransley in relation to the asylum and Article  3  claims,  the
    decision to allow the appeal under Article 8 ECHR involved  such  error
    of law that the decision could not stand and had to be  set  aside  and
    remade, preserving the findings and conclusions in relation to  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and Article 3. The error  of  law  decision  is
    annexed.

 6.  The  matter  then   came   back   before   me   on   27.1.15   for   a
    resumed/continuation hearing, restricted to the issue of Article 8 ECHR
    alone.

 7. As set out in the error of law decision, the relevant background to the
    appeal can be summarised as follows. The appellant arrived in the UK on
    29.12.06 as a family visitor, accompanied  by  her  husband  and  their
    child. The husband left her in 2007. She gave birth to a  second  child
    in 2010, fathered by a Nigerian national with whom she is no longer  in
    contact. The appellant has a father and four siblings in  the  UK,  all
    British citizens. The appellant claimed asylum on 9.7.13, with her  two
    daughters  as  dependants.  Her  claim  was  based  on  her   fear   of
    mistreatment due to her religion and that her daughter would be  forced
    to undergo FGM. She has also claimed that her  younger  daughter  would
    face mistreatment in breach of Article 3 on account of  the  stigma  in
    Nigeria attached to those suffering from epilepsy.

 8. At �28 of the First-tier Tribunal decision Judge Ransley concluded that
    the claimant's alleged fear of her daughter being forced to undergo FGM
    in Nigeria lacked credibility and dismissed the appeal  on  grounds  of
    being a member of a particular social group (PSG).

 9. At �37 of the First-tier Tribunal decision Judge Ransley also concluded
    that the claimant had failed to demonstrate that she would be unable to
    help her daughter access healthcare in Nigeria to manage  her  epilepsy
    and thus dismissed the Article 3 ECHR claim.

10. As explained in the error of law decision, the findings and conclusions
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  relation  to  asylum,   humanitarian
    protection, and Article 3, are sustainable and were  unchallenged,  and
    thus the appeal must be dismissed on those grounds.

11. Whilst the older child has now been in the UK for at least 7 years, she
    does  not  in  fact  meet  the  requirements  of  276ADE  because   the
    requirement is to be met at the date of  application.  However,  it  is
    relevant to any Article  8  ECHR  assessment  that  that  part  of  the
    requirement would have been met in a fresh  application.  Nevertheless,
    the remaining  requirement  would  have  been  as  to  whether  it  was
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK, even though the  7-year
    requirement had been met. For the reasons set out herein, I would  have
    found and do find on the facts of this case and for the reasons  stated
    herein that it is reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK.

12. Following recent case law, including Ganesabalan  v  SSHD  [2014]  EWHC
    2712 Admin), it is clear that there can be no threshold requirement  to
    consideration of Article 8 ECHR, unless the Rules are a complete  code,
    which they are not for consideration of Article 8 ECHR cases other than
    deportation. Further, it is likely that Article 8 has to be  considered
    because section 86 of the 2002 Act requires determination of a claim on
    the basis of human rights. I have therefore gone on  to  an  Article  8
    ECHR assessment outside the Rules.

13.  I  accept  that  in  general  terms  the  claimant  and  her  children
    established family and private life in the  UK  and  that  the  removal
    decision will amount to a sufficiently  grave  interference  so  as  to
    engage Article 8.  Their  family  life  will  continue  on  removal  to
    Nigeria, though they will be separated from other relatives in the UK.

14. However, for the reasons set  out  herein,  I  find  after  considering
    Article 8  ECHR,  applying  the  Razgar  5  steps  and  conducting  the
    proportionality balancing exercise between the rights of  the  claimant
    and her children on the one hand and on the other the  public  interest
    in the legitimate and  necessary  aim  of  the  state  to  protect  the
    economic well-being of the UK by immigration control that  the  balance
    comes down in favour of removal. In consideration of all  the  evidence
    in the round I find that  the  claimants  have  failed  to  demonstrate
    either that the removal decision is disproportionate to their rights to
    respect for their private and family life, or that the decision can  be
    regarded in any other way as unjustifiably harsh (Nagre).

15.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  have  taken  account  of  all  the
    documentary and oral evidence, whether or not  specifically  referenced
    in this decision, as well as the written and oral  submissions  of  the
    representatives of the claimant and the Secretary of  State,  including
    the skeleton argument dated 5.11.13. As the parties are fully aware  of
    the documents submitted and other evidence adduced, it  is  unnecessary
    to list that evidence here.

16. However, I have in particular considered the  new  evidence,  including
    the  social  work  report  and  other  documents  in   the   claimant's
    supplementary bundle of 67 pages handed in at the  hearing  before  me,
    together with a photograph of the claimant with her  family  and  other
    relatives, including her son and father, said to  have  been  taken  at
    Christmas 2014. I also heard oral evidence from the  claimant,  relying
    on her witness statement dated at the hearing.

17. I found the claimant a poor and unreliable witness. She claims that she
    has another child in the UK, an adult son who lives in London with  his
    British girlfriend. I found the claimant to  be  disingenuous  and  not
    truthful when she claimed that she did not know his actual  address.  I
    am satisfied that she  does  know  his  address  but  is  unwilling  to
    disclose it, perhaps fearful of immigration authorities finding out. It
    appears that her son is an overstayer and has no present application to
    remain in the UK, and thus no reason to  consider  that  there  is  any
    valid family life in the UK with that son. She claims that he is  shown
    in the Christmas photograph.

18. In relation to contact with her husband the claimant said that she last
    spoke with him in November 2014, when he was in Nigeria, and  last  saw
    him in 2006 when they all came to the  UK  together.  I  was  far  from
    satisfied that she was  being  truthful  about  her  contact  with  her
    husband. Later she said it was December 2014 that she last  spoke  with
    him. It was pointed out that he has a 5-year multi-visit visa  for  the
    UK, which she claimed not to know until told  recently.  Judge  Ransley
    did not accept that he was not the father of the  younger  child,  whom
    the claimant referred to as Stephanie, although she is Eyitayo, and  it
    is clear that his name  is  on  that  child's  birth  certificate.  The
    claimant asserts that the real father of that child has  fled  and  she
    has no contact with him. I note that when the father, Olayide  Adebayo,
    made his visit visa application he  said  he  was  visiting  his  three
    children in the UK and Tayo Adebayo with date of birth 24.1.12 is named
    both in the computer printed  part  and  the  handwritten  application,
    although in this second document the date of birth is  not  given.  The
    claimant denied this was  Stephanie,  but  in  the  light  of  all  the
    evidence I am satisfied  that  he  is  the  father  of  both  children,
    consistent with the birth certificates.

19. The husband's VAF suggests  at  8.8  that  he  was  going  to  visit  a
    'relative' named as  Babatunde  Olufisibe.  Asked  who  this  was,  the
    claimant said it might be his cousin. Asked if she had ever met him she
    said no. When it was pointed out to her that he was her sponsor on  her
    own VAF for application to come to  the  UK,  she  then  said  that  on
    arrival in the UK they stayed with him for  5  days  in  Dagenham.  She
    accepted that  she  had  met  him  but  declined  to  explain  why  she
    previously  said  she  did  not.  I  found  this  evidence   completely
    contradictory and reached the conclusion  that  the  claimant  was  not
    telling the truth and that I could place no reliance on any part of her
    evidence, including her assertion that her husband was not  the  father
    of Stephanie, the younger child, or that she was not in regular contact
    and on good terms with him.

20. I have also carefully considered section 55 of the 2009 Act in relation
    to the best interests of both children as a primary  consideration  and
    in particular the length of time, now over  8  years,  that  the  older
    child has spent in the UK; that she 'felt British;' and  that  she  has
    been in education in the UK since the age of 5;  and  that  she  cannot
    recall her early life in Nigeria.  I accept that lengthy  residence  in
    the UK can lead to development of social cultural and educational  ties
    that will be disrupted, but both children remain very young  and  their
    primary focus for emotional and social  development  and  support  will
    have centred on the family and the home.

21. In conducting the proportionality balancing  exercise  and  the  weight
    attributable to the children's best interests I have had regard to  the
    judgement of the Supreme Court in Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74. I have
    to bear in mind that neither child is British and they have no right or
    legitimate expectation to education, life and career in the UK. On  the
    facts of this case I find that the best interests of  the  children  in
    this case are to remain with their parent. On the  basis  that  I  have
    found that it is  reasonable  to  expect  the  claimant  to  return  to
    Nigeria, it is entirely reasonable to expect the children to  accompany
    her. It is also clear  that  if  either  of  the  children  could  have
    succeeded, then both children and the appellant must  also  succeed  in
    being able to remain in the UK.  There can be no question of separating
    the children from each other or the claimant.

22. Whilst the fear of FGM has been discounted by the preserved findings of
    the First-tier Tribunal, I have take  account  of  the  fact  that  the
    younger child has been treated for epilepsy.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    rejected  for  lack  of  credible  reliable  evidence  the   assertion,
    supported  by  the  report  of  Mr  Foxcroft,  that   she   will   face
    discrimination on return to Nigeria, or that there is a serious  stigma
    attached to epilepsy or risk of being accused of witchcraft. Whilst the
    evidence  presented  is  insufficient  to  cross  the  high  Article  3
    threshold, as found by the First-tier Tribunal,  I  take  into  account
    that in MM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 279, the Court  of  Appeal
    found that lack of equivalent medical care in  a  person's  country  of
    origin may engage Article 8, but only as an  additional  factor  to  be
    weighed in the balance with other factors which  by  themselves  engage
    Article 8. In that case the continuing medical care  of  the  appellant
    suffering schizophrenia depended on the  day  to  day  support  of  his
    family. That is not the situation in the present appeal. The First-tier
    Tribunal found  that  medical  facilities  for  treating  epilepsy  are
    available in Nigeria and also found that the first claimant  failed  to
    demonstrate that she would be unable to assist her younger daughter  to
    access appropriate healthcare facilities.  I  have  however  taken  the
    child's medical condition and needs, as well as a  potential  for  some
    degree of social discrimination because of epilepsy,  into  account  in
    the Article 8 balancing exercise.

23. I bear in mind that in Azimi-Moayed  and  others  (Decisions  affecting
    children: onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197 (IAC),  7  years  residence
    from age 4 is likely to be more significant to a child than the first 7
    years of life. I also  accept  that  the  elder  child  would  have  no
    significant memory of life in Nigeria.

24. However, I also have to take into account that neither the claimant nor
    her children meet the requirements of the Rules for leave to remain  as
    the parent of a child, or as children. That a claimant  does  not  meet
    the relevant Immigration Rules for leave to remain is a highly relevant
    factor that should be brought into account in the Article 8 assessment.



25. Having rejected the asylum claim, including the claimant's fear of  the
    child's father and his family in Nigeria I find that it may well be  in
    that child's best interest to have contact with the father in  that  in
    general terms it in children's best interests to have contact with both
    parents. The evidence summarised at  �24  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision was that the father had made a visit visa application in 2011,
    showing he was then in Nigeria and applying to visit  his  children  in
    the UK. The judge rejected the appellant's account  that  she  had  not
    been in contact with him. In the circumstances,  I  am  satisfied  that
    there is a degree of continuing contact with the father which  will  be
    better served in Nigeria, rather than by remaining in the UK.

26. I also have to take into account that none of  the  claimant's  family,
    nor any of their immediate relatives, have settled status in the UK. To
    that extent, I do not accept that their relationship to such  relatives
    can carry anything more  than  little  weight  in  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise. Those relatives have no right to be in the  UK  and
    should be in Nigeria.

27. In Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74, the  Supreme  Court  pointed  out  in
    respect of the best interests of children that  in  ZH  (Tanzania)  the
    court was dealing with children who were British citizens. In that case
    the children by virtue of their nationality had  significant  benefits,
    including  a  right  of  abode  and  rights  to  future  education  and
    healthcare in this  country,  which  the  children  in  this  case,  as
    citizens of Nigeria, do not. The benefits of British citizenship are an
    important factor in assessing whether it  is  reasonable  to  expect  a
    child with such citizenship to live in another country.  Those  factors
    do not apply to the children in this case. Neither the claimant nor the
    children could have had any legitimate expectation  of  being  able  to
    remain in the UK.

28. The Supreme Court also held that, "the decision-maker  is  required  to
    assess the proportionality of the interference with private and  family
    life in the particular circumstances in which the decision is made. The
    evaluative exercise in assessing the proportionality of a measure under
    Article 8 ECHR excludes any  "hard-edged  or  bright-line  rule  to  be
    applied to the generality of cases": EB (Kosovo) v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2009] AC 1159, per Lord Bingham  at  para  12.
    Secondly, as Lord Mance pointed out in H (H) (at para 98) the decision-
    maker must evaluate the child's best interests and in some  cases  they
    may point only marginally in one, rather than another, direction."

29. At �24 the Supreme Court stated on the facts of that case that,  "There
    is no irrationality in the conclusion that it  was  in  the  children's
    best interests to go with their parents to the Republic  of  Congo.  No
    doubt it would have been possible to have  stated  that,  other  things
    being equal, it was in the best interests of the children that they and
    their parents stayed in the United Kingdom so that  they  could  obtain
    such benefits as health care and  education  which  the  decision-maker
    recognised might be of a higher standard than would be available in the
    Congo. But other things were not equal. They were not British citizens.
    They had no right to future education and health care in this  country.
    They were part of a close-knit family with highly educated parents  and
    were of an age when their emotional  needs  could  only  be  fully  met
    within the immediate family unit. Such integration as had occurred into
    United Kingdom society would have been predominantly in the context  of
    that family unit. Most significantly,  the  decision-  maker  concluded
    that they could be removed to the Republic of  Congo  in  the  care  of
    their parents without serious detriment to their well-being."

30. In EV (Philippines) the Court of Appeal  held  that  in  answering  the
    question whether it is in the best interests of a child to  remain  the
    longer the child has been in the UK the greater the weight  that  falls
    into one side of the scales. "In the balance on the  other  side  there
    falls to be taken into account the strong weight to  be  given  to  the
    need to maintain immigration control in pursuit of the  economic  well-
    being of the country and the fact that, ex  hyopthesi,  the  applicants
    have no entitlement to remain." "If it is  overwhelmingly  the  child's
    best interests  that  he  should  not  return,  the  need  to  maintain
    immigration control may well not tip the balance. By contrast, if it is
    in the child's best interests to remain, but only on balance (with some
    factors pointing the other way), the result may be the opposite."  "The
    immigration history of the patents may also be relevant  e.g.  if  they
    are overstayers, or have acted deceitfully."

31.  I  find  in  conducting  the  balancing  exercise  that  it  there  is
    insufficient here to  demonstrate  an  overwhelming  best  interest  to
    remain. The children  are  not  British  and  have  no  entitlement  to
    education or life in the UK at the expense of the tax-payer. All things
    being equal their best interests would  be  to  remain  here  and  take
    advantage of the benefits of life in the UK. But, as has  been  stated,
    all things are not equal and the UK cannot educate the world.  Pursuant
    to EV (Philippines) and the skeleton argument I  confirm  that  I  have
    considered the following factors:

      a) The age of the child claimants;

      b) Length of time in the UK,

      c) Length of time in education;

      d) To what extent they have become distanced from life and culture  of
         Nigeria. I accept that they have no direct  experience  of  it  and
         there will be a difficult period of adjustment;

      e) How  renewable  their  connection  will  be.  The  family  will  be
         returning as a whole to a community and life and  culture  familiar
         to the first claimant and the children will have her support in the
         transition;

      f) To  what  extent  they  will  have  linguistic,  medical  or  other
         difficulties in adapting to their life in that country. As set  out
         herein, I accept that there will be difficulties of integration and
         adjustment, but as the children are young  they  will  be  able  to
         adapt with the support the first claimant;

      g) The extent to which the course proposed will interfere  with  their
         family life or rights  if  they  have  any)  as  British  citizens.
         Neither child is a British citizen, but I accept that the  decision
         to remove is a sufficiently grave  interference  so  as  to  engage
         Article 8.

32. Although it predates the coming into force of section 117B of the  2002
    Act, I have also carefully considered the President's guidance  in  the
    case of JO and Others (section  55  duty)  Nigeria  [2014]  UKUT  00517
    (IAC), and in particular the need to  be  adequately  informed  and  to
    conduct a scrupulous analysis of the children's best interests,  making
    a careful examination of all relevant information and factors.

33. In considering the best interests of the children, I  have  also  taken
    into account  all  those  factors  urged  upon  me  by  the  claimant's
    representative, as well as those considered by Judge Ransley, including
    the  children's  long  residence,  education  and  schooling,  and  the
    family's desire to settle in the  UK,  where  they  have  other  family
    members, and social life and activities. The extent of this integration
    by at least the elder child if not both  children  is  significant  and
    should not be underestimated. I also accept  that  all  the  children's
    friends and associates are in the UK and they speak  English  fluently.
    Life as they know it is English and Nigeria must be a remote factor  in
    their background. However, I have  to  set  all  of  these  matters  in
    balance against the  public  interest  and  the  background  facts  and
    history as set out above, including that they have  no  entitlement  to
    British life.

34. In considering that public interest in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise I am also obliged to have regard to section 117B of  the  2002
    Act:

           117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
           cases


           (1)    The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
           the public interest.


           (2)    It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-


              (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and


              (b) are better able to integrate into society.


           (3)    It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           financially independent, because such persons-


              (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and


              (b) are better able to integrate into society.


           (4)    Little weight should be given to-


              (a) a private life, or


              (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that  is
              established by a person at a time when the person is  in  the
              United Kingdom unlawfully.


           (5)     Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private   life
           established by a person at a time when the person's  immigration
           status is precarious.


           (6)    In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
           the public interest does not require the person's removal where-


              (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
              relationship with a qualifying child, and


              (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
              the United Kingdom.


35. It follows from section 117B that little weight should be given to  any
    private life established by the claimant or her  children,  given  that
    their immigration status was to say the least precarious, even with  3C
    leave, and that they overstayed in the UK for several years. It is also
    relevant that  the  claimant  is  not  financially  independent.  These
    factors are to be taken into the balancing exercise with their  private
    and family life in the UK.

36. Little assistance is gained by the claimant  or  her  children  in  the
    terms of 117B(6) as it amounts to the same test for the third  claimant
    under 276ADE: whether it is reasonable to expect the child to leave the
    UK.

37. In the  circumstances,  applying  the  above  case  law  and  statutory
    considerations to the facts of this case, there is no legitimate  basis
    for considering that the best interests of the children are  to  remain
    in the UK because of their family or private life, or  because  of  the
    schooling or associations with friends and teachers derived  from  such
    schooling to which they are not entitled.

38. Such private life as either of the children may have established in the
    UK is no more than one would expect in the circumstances, including the
    eldest being in school since she was  aged  5  and  starting  secondary
    school. The natural desires of the claimant and the children to  remain
    in the UK are but one factor to be considered  in  the  proportionality
    assessment.

39. In respect of the younger child, in the light of MM, referred to above,
    little assistance in  the  Article  8  assessment  can  be  derived  in
    relation to her ongoing treatment for epilepsy. There  is  no  reliable
    evidence of any likely social discrimination,  and  medical  facilities
    for treating epilepsy are available in Nigeria. This child is  not  yet
    at school and no issue arises about the ability of teachers to manage a
    child with epilepsy.

40. I take into account that the claimant has worked illegally in  the  UK,
    despite having children and thus there is no reason why she should  not
    seek work on return to Nigeria.

41. I have considered the medical and schooling records handed  in  at  the
    hearing of 14.7.14 and the more recent letter of  Dr  Belderbos,  dated
    8.10.14. This latter indicates that the second child is  being  treated
    with Keppra. It is stated that if she were unable to receive medication
    or seek emergency treatment in the event of  a  seizure  she  would  be
    likely to have recurrent and possibly prolonged seizures, with  a  risk
    of death in a prolonged seizure. I note that the last  time  the  child
    saw Dr Belderbos was in July 2014 and there has been no  recent  change
    in medication. In the circumstances, little weight can be  ascribed  to
    this issue in the proportionality balancing exercise and I am satisfied
    that appropriate medical treatment will be accessible to the  child  in
    Nigeria, based on the information in the COIS report for Nigeria, which
    shows the country has a functioning health system. Taken together  with
    the preserved findings of the First-tier Tribunal, there is no  genuine
    basis for any fear or risk of harm on return to  Nigeria.  Her  claimed
    fear of her in-laws  or  her  husband  I  find  to  be  a  fabrication.
    Similarly, I am satisfied that she invented the claimed fear of FGM.  I
    am also satisfied on the evidence  that  her  husband,  with  whom  she
    remains on good terms and  in  contact,  is  the  father  of  both  her
    children living with her.

42. It would appear that her husband was also dishonest in his VAF made  on
    19.12.11. At 4.17 the date of birth of Tayo is deliberately not  given,
    although he had given it correctly as 7.10.12 in a previous application
    listing Tayo as his daughter, the same date that appears in  the  birth
    certificate. At 4.14 he said that his spouse currently lived  with  him
    at the address given in Nigeria, when she was  in  fact  living  as  an
    illegal overstayer in the UK. 4.18 suggests  that  all  three  children
    were living with him at the same address. If in fact  he  had  admitted
    that his wife and children were still  in  the  UK,  having  overstayed
    their visa, it is most probable that he would not have been granted the
    visa.

43. In relation to the social work report, I  find  it  unsatisfactory  and
    that limited weight can be ascribed to it, though it is fairly  obvious
    that there will be some sadness and disruption if the family is removed
    to Nigeria. Amongst a number of concerns, I note that it was  based  on
    interviews with 5 people, two of which were by  telephone.  The  author
    does not appear to have had  access  to  any  of  the  case  documents,
    including  the  refusal  decision,  the  findings  of  the   First-tier
    Tribunal, or any witness statements. The report is  deficient  in  that
    the author is not aware of the correct factual  context  before  making
    any assessment. It also appears to take everything said at face  value;
    the claimant's account is accepted in its  entirety  and  there  is  no
    critical assessment. Some of the information upon which the  assessment
    is based is questionable, such as the claim at �17 that Simisola has  a
    close relationship with her older brother, referred to as Israel.  That
    appears inconsistent with the claimant's  account  of  limited  contact
    with him. More significantly, there is no indication that the author of
    the report is aware that the son in illegally present in the UK with no
    basis or even application to remain and thus no reason why he would not
    be able to return with the claimant and  the  rest  of  the  family  to
    Nigeria. It necessarily follows that assessments  as  to  relationships
    with  family  members  are  questionable  and  cannot  be   given   any
    significant weight.

44. Some of the comments and opinions in the report, including those at �42
    to �45, should be disregarded as they reflect a repeated  claim  as  to
    FGM and discrimination  on  the  basis  of  epilepsy,  which  has  been
    discounted by Judge Ransley. I further note that  the  only  source  of
    information in the report about attitudes to epilepsy appears to  be  a
    single, undated, study of one particular secondary school in a part  of
    Nigeria. The child with epilepsy is not at secondary school, or even at
    school at all, as I understand it. In the circumstances, the  value  of
    such a report is questionable. It is not clear on what basis the author
    of the report can speak with any authority about  stigma  attaching  to
    epilepsy in Nigeria. This evidence is in reality rather poor. For these
    reasons, I find that at best the expert report it is  a  one-sided  and
    incomplete assessment of the claimant's circumstances. Whilst I take it
    into account in the  balancing  exercise,  I  accord  it  only  limited
    weight.

45.  Balancing  all  these  matters  together,  in   the   round   in   the
    proportionality balancing exercise, I find  that  the  removal  of  the
    claimant and her children from the  UK  is  an  entirely  proportionate
    decision  and  whilst  it  may  cause  some  temporary  difficulty  and
    disruption, on the facts of this case it  is  neither  disproportionate
    nor for any other reason unjustifiably harsh. I find  on  the  evidence
    that it is entirely reasonable to expect both children and the claimant
    to return to Nigeria, even though the elder child has now been  in  the
    UK in excess of 8 years. The family unit will  remain  intact  as  they
    will leave together. Although there are ties with wider family  members
    in the UK, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that  these  are
    so close and intimate that there is a situation of  dependency  between
    these family members and those others, including the  claimant's  adult
    son, her father and other relatives. They  will  be  able  to  maintain
    contact through modern means of communication  and  through  occasional
    visits, for which there are immigration provisions.

46. I have to bear in mind that the asylum and Article 3 claims  have  been
    dismissed and thus that the claimant has been in  the  UK  deliberately
    and unlawfully for a long period of time, with no  attempt  until  very
    late to regularise her stay. Even then her application was rejected and
    her appeal dismissed. The claimant is not entitled to settle in the  UK
    just because she has chosen to remain her in breach of  the  conditions
    of entry and because she has managed to evade  immigration  authorities
    for so long. Whilst  I  have  taken  full  account  of  the  effect  of
    relatively long residence on the children, more than 8  years  for  the
    older child, and that this situation is no fault of either  child,  the
    fact remains that they have no  entitlement  to  remain  here.  I  take
    account of the significant length and age at which the older child  has
    established private life  in  the  UK,  as  well  as  the  evidence  of
    associations and friendships outside the family unit.  Mr  Medley-Daley
    submitted in error that Simisola was close to being entitled to British
    citizenship by virtue of 10 years residence, but  that  cannot  be  the
    case where the child was not born in the UK. In the circumstances, that
    submission has no relevance to the Article 8 assessment.

47. There are immigration rules for those seeking entry or to remain and it
    is clear that the claimant cannot meet any of those requirements, which
    is itself highly relevant to the Article  8  assessment.  However,  the
    strongest factors weighing against the claimant and  her  children  are
    those which were not in consideration by Judge Ransley and  which  came
    into force on 28.7.14. I am required to have regard to  the  fact  that
    little weight is to be ascribed to any private life accrued whilst  the
    claimant's was present illegally or her status was  precarious.  Taking
    these considerations into the balance, it is  clear  that  the  balance
    falls in favour of removal.

Conclusion & Decision:

48. For the reasons set out herein, I find  in  apply  the  Razgar  5  step
    assessment, of which the most crucial is  the  proportionality  balance
    between on the one hand the rights of the claimant and her two children
    and on the other the legitimate and necessary aim of the state  in  the
    public interest to protect the economic well-being of  the  UK  through
    the application of  immigration  control,  that  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State was proportionate to the  private  and  family  life
    rights of the claimant and her  two  children,  and  not  unjustifiably
    harsh. For the reasons preserved from the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
    the asylum, humanitarian protection  and  Article  3  claims  are  also
    dismissed.

                    The appeal is dismissed on all grounds.

Representation:
For the claimant: Mr S Medley-Daley, instructed by Broudie Jackson & Canter
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Ayodele Funmilola Adebayo, date of birth  19.6.68,  is  a
    citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley, who allowed the claimant's appeal
    on human rights grounds against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  to
    refuse her asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims  and
    to remove her from the UK as an illegal entrant.  The Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 6.11.13.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Froom  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    6.12.13.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 22.5.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Ransley should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    appellant  arrived  in  the  UK  on  29.12.06  as  a  family   visitor,
    accompanied by her husband and their child. The  husband  left  her  in
    2007. She gave birth to a second child in 2010, fathered by a  Nigerian
    national with whom she is no longer in contact.  The  appellant  has  a
    father and four siblings in the UK, all British citizens. The appellant
    claimed asylum on 9.7.13, with her two  daughters  as  dependants.  Her
    claim was based on her fear of mistreatment due  to  her  religion  and
    that her daughter would be forced to undergo FGM. She has also  claimed
    that her younger daughter would face mistreatment in breach of  Article
    3 on account of the stigma in Nigeria attached to those suffering  from
    epilepsy.

 7.  At  �28  of  the  determination  Judge  Ransley  concluded  that   the
    appellant's claimed fear of her daughter being forced to undergo FGM in
    Nigeria lacked credibility and dismissed the appeal on grounds of being
    a member of a particular social group (PSG).

 8. At �37 of the determination Judge Ransley concluded that the  appellant
    had failed to demonstrate that she would be able to help  her  daughter
    access healthcare in Nigeria to manage her epilepsy and thus  dismissed
    the Article 3 ECHR claim.

 9. However, between �38 and �51 the judge reached the conclusion that  the
    removal of the appellant would be disproportionate to her rights  under
    Article 8 ECHR and with reference to section 55  of  the  2009  Act  in
    relation to the children. The judge considered it was not in  the  best
    interests of the children to be removed to Nigeria. The older child had
    spent 6 years and  10  months  in  the  UK,  'felt  British,'  and  had
    established a strong private life, having been in education  since  the
    age of 5. The younger child was being treated for epilepsy and  it  was
    not in her best interests to be separated from her sister.

10. The grounds  of  appeal  submit  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    misdirected herself in law in failing to recognise that the Immigration
    Rules make clear that children who have spent less than 7 years in  the
    UK will not have developed a strong enough private life in  the  UK  to
    outweigh  the  public  interest  in  immigration  control,  outside  of
    exceptional  circumstances  rendering  such  a  decision  unjustifiably
    harsh. The Tribunal had no regard to  this  aspect  of  the  Rules  and
    simply proceeded to consider the appeal  on  the  basis  of  Article  8
    proportionality.

11. It is also submitted that the Tribunal failed to apply the principle in
    MM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 279,  which  found  that  lack  of
    equivalent medical care in a person's  country  of  origin  may  engage
    Article 8, but only as an  additional  factor  to  be  weighed  in  the
    balance with other factors which by themselves  engage  Article  8.  In
    that case the  continuing  medical  care  of  the  appellant  suffering
    schizophrenia depended on the day to day support of his family. That is
    not the situation in the present appeal.

12. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Froom found it  arguable  that,
    "the judge erred in conducting the proportionality  balancing  exercise
    and the weight attributable to the children's  best  interests  in  the
    light of the recent judgement of the Supreme Court in  Zoumbas  v  SSHD
    [2013] UKSC 74, given that, in this case, neither child is British. All
    grounds may be argued."

13. Ms Johnstone accepted that if one of the children succeeded, then  both
    children and the appellant must also succeed in being able to remain in
    the UK.

14. No issue was taken that after finding that the appellant failed on  her
    asylum and humanitarian protection claims, as well as Article  3  ECHR,
    the  judge  proceeded   immediately   to   consider   the   appellant's
    circumstances under  Article  8  ECHR,  without  reference  to  Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640  (IAC),  and
    subsequent authority promulgated after the First-tier Tribunal hearing.
    It was conceded that the appellant did not  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM and EX1, as the children had not  been  in  the  UK  for  7
    years, and neither  could  she  meet  the  requirements  of  276ADE  in
    relation to private life.

15. At �48-49, the judge  relied  on  Azimi-Moayed  and  others  (Decisions
    affecting children: onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197  (IAC),  and  the
    comments that 7 years from age 4 is likely to be more significant to  a
    child than the first 7 years of life.  The  judge  concluded  that  the
    elder child, then 11, had spent 6 years 10 months in the UK and had  no
    significant memory of life in Nigeria. The judge concluded that on  the
    basis of section 55 it would not be in  the  best  interests  for  that
    child to be removed to Nigeria with her mother.

16. I accept that the judge does not have to set  out  every  factor  taken
    into account,  but  it  must  be  clear  from  the  determination  that
    appropriate factors have been taken into account and that inappropriate
    factors have not been taken  into  account.  I  also  accept  that  the
    evaluative proportionality exercise may  not  have  bright,  hard-edged
    boundaries, but has to fairly consider all of the relevant evidence  in
    the round, both those factors in favour of the appellants  as  well  as
    those in favour of removal.

17. However, it is clear that the judge failed to take  into  account  that
    the appellant did not meet the requirements of the Rules for  leave  to
    remain as the parent of a child, as the children had not been in the UK
    for the necessary 7 years and it had not been shown that it  would  not
    be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK.  That  an  appellant
    does not meet the relevant Immigration Rules for leave to remain  is  a
    highly relevant factor that should be brought into account.

18. The judge also failed to consider the other aspects  of  Azimi.  Having
    rejected the asylum  claim,  including  the  appellant's  fear  of  the
    child's father and his family, the judge  failed  to  consider  whether
    returning to Nigeria and to contact with their father might in fact  be
    in the children's best interests, having contact with both parents. The
    evidence summarised at �24 was that the father had made  a  visit  visa
    application in 2011, showing he was then in  Nigeria  and  applying  to
    visit his children in  the  UK.  The  judge  rejected  the  appellant's
    account that she had not been in contact with him.

19. The judge also failed to take into account that neither the  appellant,
    nor the children, nor any immediate  relative  of  the  appellant,  had
    settled status in the UK, and that it would in  such  circumstances  be
    peculiar to take into account the children's close relationship to such
    relatives in the UK. They had no right to be in the UK and should be in
    Nigeria.

20. In Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74, the  Supreme  Court  pointed  out  in
    respect of the best interests of children that  in  ZH  (Tanzania)  the
    court was dealing with children who were British citizens. In that case
    the children by virtue of their nationality had  significant  benefits,
    including  a  right  of  abode  and  rights  to  future  education  and
    healthcare in this  country,  which  the  children  in  this  case,  as
    citizens of Nigeria, do not. The benefits of British citizenship are an
    important factor in assessing whether it  is  reasonable  to  expect  a
    child with such citizenship to live in another country.  Those  factors
    do not apply to the children in this case. Neither  the  appellant  nor
    the children could have had any legitimate expectation of being able to
    remain in the UK.

21. The Supreme Court also held that, "the decision-maker  is  required  to
    assess the proportionality of the interference with private and  family
    life in the particular circumstances in which the decision is made. The
    evaluative exercise in assessing the proportionality of a measure under
    Article 8 ECHR excludes any  "hard-edged  or  bright-line  rule  to  be
    applied to the generality of cases": EB (Kosovo) v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2009] AC 1159, per Lord Bingham  at  para  12.
    Secondly, as Lord Mance pointed out in H(H) (at para 98) the  decision-
    maker must evaluate the child's best interests and in some  cases  they
    may point only marginally in one, rather than another, direction."

22. At �24 the Supreme Court stated on the facts of that case that,  "There
    is no irrationality in the conclusion that it  was  in  the  children's
    best interests to go with their parents to the Republic  of  Congo.  No
    doubt it would have been possible to have  stated  that,  other  things
    being equal, it was in the best interests of the children that they and
    their parents stayed in the United Kingdom so that  they  could  obtain
    such benefits as health care and  education  which  the  decision-maker
    recognised might be of a higher standard than would be available in the
    Congo. But other things were not equal. They were not British citizens.
    They had no right to future education and health care in this  country.
    They were part of a close-knit family with highly educated parents  and
    were of an age when their emotional  needs  could  only  be  fully  met
    within the immediate family unit. Such integration as had occurred into
    United Kingdom society would have been predominantly in the context  of
    that family unit. Most significantly,  the  decision-  maker  concluded
    that they could be removed to the Republic of  Congo  in  the  care  of
    their parents without serious detriment to their well-being."

23. There was in the present case no expert evidence as to  the  effect  on
    the children of returning to Nigeria, or other satisfactory evidence of
    serious detriment to their well-being. Obviously there is a close  bond
    between the mother and the  children  and  one  would  not  be  removed
    without the others. Such private life  as  the  elder  child  may  have
    established in the UK was no more than one would have expected  in  the
    circumstances, including being in school since  she  was  aged  5.  The
    natural desires of the appellant and the children to remain in  the  UK
    were but one factor to be considered in the proportionality assessment.
    The judge highlighted no other significant factor in the  private  life
    other than relationship with relatives, whom, as mentioned above,  have
    no apparent right to be in the UK themselves.

24. In all the circumstances I find, for the reasons set  out  above,  that
    the proportionality exercise in relation to the elder child was  flawed
    in that it failed to bring into account  those  factors  in  favour  of
    removal of the children with the appellant.

25. In respect of the younger child, in the light of MM, referred to above,
    the judge applied too great weight  in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise, to the treatment for epilepsy of the  younger  child.  Having
    found it failed to cross the Article 3 threshold and  having  concluded
    that there was no reliable evidence of  likely  social  discrimination,
    and that medical facilities for  treating  epilepsy  are  available  in
    Nigeria. it makes no sense to exclude that as a factor under Article  3
    only to bring it back into play in respect of Article 8,  without  some
    compelling reason to do so. I  further  note  that  at  �50  the  judge
    appears to have considered the ability of teachers to  manage  children
    with epilepsy, when this child was not yet in school at the date of the
    determination.

26. Whilst if the decision is remade the Article 8 family and private  life
    considerations would have to be made on the basis of the  circumstances
    then prevailing, including that one of the children would have been  in
    the UK for over 7 years, that does not mean that  the  appellant  would
    necessarily succeed under EX1 of Appendix FM, as it would still have to
    be shown that it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
    the UK. 7 years alone is insufficient. In the circumstances,  I  reject
    the argument that the errors of law are immaterial because  the  appeal
    would have to be allowed.

27. In all the circumstances, whilst there  is  no  challenge  from  either
    party to the judge's findings in relation to the asylum and  Article  3
    decisions, for the reasons set out above, I find for  the  reasons  set
    out herein that the decision in respect of Article 8 cannot  stand  and
    must be set aside to be remade.

28. Having reserved my decision in respect of the error of  law,  it  would
    not be right to proceed to  remake  the  decision  without  giving  the
    parties the opportunity to make further submissions as to the Article 8
    factors, and I thus adjourn  the  appeal  for  a  continuation  hearing
    before myself at a date to be fixed.

Conclusions:

29. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision in respect of Article 8 ECHR.

                    I preserve the findings and conclusions in  relation  to
                    asylum, humanitarian protection, and Article 3 ECHR.

                    I  adjourn  the  appeal  for  a  continuation   hearing,
                    reserved to myself.

Consequential Directions

30. Either party has leave to adduce further evidence, limited to the issue
    of Article 8 private and family life.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case.
