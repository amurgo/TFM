                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For ease of reference, I shall refer to the parties as they were before
    the First-tier Tribunal. The Secretary of State is the  Respondent  and
    Miss Zeren is once more the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Parkes (the judge), promulgated on 3 September 2015,  in
    which he allowed the Appellant's appeal. That appeal  was  against  the
    Respondent's decisions of 10 March 2015,  refusing  to  vary  leave  to
    remain and to remove  the  Appellant  from  the  United  Kingdom  under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 3. The Appellant is a national  of  Turkey  and  her  application  to  the
    Respondent was based on  claimed  establishment  under  the  ECAA  (the
    Ankara Agreement). The application had been refused on the ground  that
    the Respondent believed the Appellant to have been working in breach of
    the conditions of her previous leave.



The judge's decision

 4. In a brief decision the judge sets out evidence from the  Appellant  on
    the breach of conditions issue which, on a fair reading of the text, he
    regarded as problematic to say the least (paragraphs  10-11).  However,
    there is no finding on the matter. In paragraphs 12  to  14  the  judge
    accepts that as at the date of hearing the Appellant had set herself in
    business and that the business was genuine.  On  that  basis  alone  he
    allowed the appeal.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 5. The Respondent challenged the decision on the basis that there  was  no
    finding on the breach of conditions issue, and that this was  important
    given the discretionary nature of paragraphs 4 and 21 of HC 510.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes on
    15 January 2016. In addition to the content of the grounds,  the  grant
    comments on the arguably erroneous approach taken by the  judge  as  to
    what was required by the Appellant in order for  leave  to  be  granted
    under the ECAA.



The hearing before me

 7. I received and took note of Ms Shaw's rule  24  response.  Mr  Richards
    relied on the grounds of appeal.

 8. I have little hesitation in finding that the judge materially erred  in
    law.

 9. It is apparent on the face of the decision that  there  is  no  express
    finding on whether the Appellant in fact breached the conditions of her
    previous leave. That was a live issue, as raised by the  Respondent  in
    her refusal notice. There was evidence on the issue before  the  judge.
    It might appear as though the judge was in effect finding  against  the
    Appellant on the point, but it required a clear expression.

10. The error was clearly material, as paragraphs 4 and 21 of  HC  510  are
    inherently discretionary in their nature and a matter such as breach of
    conditions is highly pertinent to the  outcome  of  an  application  or
    indeed an appeal.

11. Further, as highlighted in the grant of permission, the  judge  appears
    to have proceeded on the basis that all the Appellant needed to do  was
    show that she was in business as at the date of hearing.  That  is  not
    correct.

12. It is  also  true  that  notwithstanding  the  existence  of  financial
    information from the Appellant, there are no findings  on  whether  she
    was able to support herself from the profits of the enterprise.

13. In light of the above, I set aside the judge's decision.



Disposal

14. Both representatives agreed that this case should be  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal. Having regard  to  paragraph  7  of  the  Practice
    Statements, I do remit this case. As a result of the judge's failure to
    address particular matters, significant findings of fact are yet to  be
    made.

15. I issue relevant directions, below.



Anonymity

16. No direction has been sought and none is appropriate.



Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.


Directions to the parties:

   1. The judge's findings at paragraphs 12-14 are preserved insofar as they
      establish that the Appellant's business in Coventry is a genuine one;
   2. At the remitted hearing  the  issues  to  be  addressed  will  include
      whether or not the Appellant breached the conditions of  her  pervious
      leave, the effect  of  any  breach  (should  this  be  found  to  have
      occurred) on the Appellant's case, and whether  the  current  business
      provides sufficient profit to support her;
   3. Any further evidence relied on by either party must be filed with  the
      First-tier Tribunal and served on the other  side  no  later  than  10
      working days before the remitted hearing;
   4. Both parties must comply with any further  directions  issued  by  the
      First-tier Tribunal.

Directions for listing:

   1. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at the Sheldon Court
      hearing centre, to be heard on a date to be fixed by that centre;
   2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes shall not be involved in the remitted
      hearing;
   3. No interpreter is required for the remitted hearing;
   4. There is a 1 ï¿½ hour time estimate for the remitted hearing.



Signed                                       Date:  20 April 2016
