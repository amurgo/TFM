                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants who are citizens of Turkey and whose date of births  are
    2 February 1969 and 15 March 1996 appealed against the decision of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer in Istanbul made on 26 September 2013 to refuse
    to grant them entry clearances pursuant to paragraph E- ECP. 2.  6  and
    2. 10 of the Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the European Convention
    on Human Rights to leave to enter the United Kingdom,  as  a  wife  and
    child of the sponsor under  Appendix  FM.  Their  appeals  against  the
    respondent's decisions were dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  S
    Taylor following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 1  October  2014.   First
    -tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett refused permission to appeal  and  Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge Archer gave permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, stating that it was arguable that the Judge by  finding  that
    the decision does not engage Article 8 is a material error of law.

 2. The Judge in his determination stated the following. It was accepted by
    the Judge at paragraph 10 that the  appellants  are  related  to  their
    sponsor as claimed. The sponsor entered the United Kingdom in 1999  and
    there was no dispute that he was granted indefinite leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom in 2010  under  the  Legacy  Scheme.  After  he  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom,  the  sponsor
    has demonstrated by evidence his five visits to Turkey since  2010  and
    has also submitted a number of photographs of himself with  his  family
    in Turkey. He has also submitted evidence of  telephonic  contact.  The
    Judge stated "I am satisfied that the appellants  are  related  to  the
    sponsor as claimed and on the balance of probabilities I  am  satisfied
    that the sponsor has an ongoing relationship to the first appellant".

 3. The Judge stated that with regard to  the  financial  requirements  the
    respondent accepted that the sponsor had submitted six months  of  wage
    slips and an appropriate employment letter. It was  accepted  that  the
    appellant submitted a P60 for the relevant employment and an employment
    contract. The only  remaining  issue  was  only  three  months  of  the
    appropriate bank statements were submitted. The application was dated 5
    July 2013 so it is accepted there to would be six  months  of  matching
    payslips bank statements for the six months prior to  the  application.
    The last payslip that appeared to have been sent with  the  application
    and therefore matching documents from December 2012 would be expected.,
    the Judge found On close examination of the submitted  bank  statements
    that a bank statement for March 2013 indicated a cash deposit  of  �800
    which does not match the submitted payslip, and that bank statements of
    December 2012 and January 2013 which  indicate  cash  deposits  but  no
    matching deposit with the submitted payslip.

 4. The Judge found that on the evidence before him that  the  sponsor  has
    failed to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules by his failure
    to provide six months of payslips and matching bank  statement  showing
    the receipt of earnings. The  assertion  in  the  respondent's  refusal
    notice that  the  appellant  has  only  submitted  the  sponsor's  bank
    statements to matching his payslips for  only  three  out  of  the  six
    months prior  to  the  application  is  therefore  correct.  While  the
    appellants may have submitted the post decision P60 for the year  ended
    April 2014 and later bank statements which match submitted payslips, as
    the date of the application and decision, they have not  complied  with
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 5. In respect of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the
    Judge found that the respondent's refusal does  not  act  to  interfere
    with an established family life in the  United  Kingdom  and  that  the
    sponsor may continue to visit the appellant in Turkey and  the  refusal
    does not interfere with the level  of  family  life  that  the  parties
    currently  enjoy.  He  added  that  in  any  event  the   sponsor   has
    demonstrated that he is working in the United Kingdom and there  is  no
    apparent obstacle  to  the  appellant's  lodging  a  fresh  application
    without delay if they wish.

    The grounds of appeal

 6. The respondent refused the appellant's application and stated that  the
    appellant's relationship to the sponsor was not genuine and  subsisting
    and that the sponsor had  not  met  the  financial  requirements  under
    paragraph ECP. 1. 1 of appendix  FM/E-ECP.  3.  3  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 7. The first-tier Tribunal found that the relationship between the sponsor
    and the appellant's  was  genuine  and  subsisting  and  therefore  the
    requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  had  been  met.  However  he
    dismissed the appeals because  he  found  that  specified  evidence  in
    relation to the  financial  requirements  had  not  been  provided  and
    therefore  the  appellants  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of   the
    Immigration Rules.

 8.  The  Judge  further  found  at  paragraph  12  that  although  further
    documentation had been submitted with evidence  that  the  sponsor  had
    earned the required amount of �22,400 to maintain the appellant's,  the
    required documentation at the date of application and decision had  not
    been provided. He then advised that because the sponsor continued to be
    employed and remunerated in the United Kingdom,  the  appellants  could
    make fresh applications without delay and thus  the  interference  with
    their family life was not disproportionate.

 9. The respondent neither provided evidence nor appeared at the hearing to
    support her decision. The sponsor instructed that he had  provided  the
    necessary documentation to the respondent in relation to the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and provided  copies  he  himself
    had  within  the  appellant's  bundle  produce  for  the  hearing.  The
    respondent thus failed to provide evidence that the specified documents
    were not in fact presented to the Entry Clearance Officer, but, in  the
    absence of any copies of the documentation in the  sponsor's  position,
    the appellant's make the following submissions.

10. The applications by their nature involved considerations of the  family
    lives of the appellants and the sponsor. The Judge  having  found  that
    the relationship between the sponsor and the  appellants  were  genuine
    and subsisting, materially erred in law by failing to properly consider
    the appeals under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

11. The sponsor has leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  as  he  is  a
    British citizen, is  employed  and  supports  the  family  through  his
    employment, and consequently the family would suffer real  hardship  if
    he now had to relocate to live with them in Turkey. The Judge failed to
    consider the right to a family life of the second appellant, who is now
    18,  and  whether  her  exclusion  is  in  their  best   interests   in
    circumstances where she is dependent on her parents but  not  permitted
    to reapply to reside with her parents under the Immigration  Rules.  It
    was insufficient as a matter of law for the  Judge  to  have  concluded
    that the decision would not interfere with the  relationships  as  they
    currently exist and he should  have  considered  whether  the  decision
    showed a lack of respect for the private and family life which existed.
    If  the  Judges  approach  is  correct,  Article  8  could   never   be
    successfully raised in an entry clearance case  which  conclusion  runs
    contrary to both domestic and Strasbourg authority.

12. Finally the Judge indicated in his remarks at  paragraph  13  that  the
    appellants could make fresh applications "without  delay"  which  would
    meet the financial requirements and he was satisfied that, but for  the
    absence of certain specified documents at the date of  application  and
    decision, the sponsor met the substantive income  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules at the relevant date as he receives an annual  income
    of �22,400. There was thus  no  economic  public  policy  reason  which
    countermanded the family's right to family life together in the  United
    Kingdom. The Judge's determination of his consideration  of  Article  8
    was a material error of law.

13. The respondent in their Rule 24 response stated the following.

14. The respondent opposes the appellant's appeal and submit that the Judge
    directed himself appropriately. Although the Judge erred in the correct
    testing paragraph 13 of the determination, it is hard to see  how  this
    would be material in the light of the recently promulgated  SSHD  v  SS
    (Congo) & others [2015] EWCA Civ 387.

    Discussion and decision as to whether there is an error of law

15. I have considered the first-tier Tribunal  Judge's  determination  with
    care. The Judge's consideration of the Immigration Rules  is  flawless.
    He found that the appellants did not provide the documents as specified
    in the Immigration Rules because  only  three  months  statements  were
    provided and six months were required by law.  I  therefore  find  that
    there was no error of law  in  the  determination  in  respect  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

16. In respect of his consideration  of  his  article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights, his reasoning  was  flawed.  The  Judge  at
    paragraph 13 stated that the refusal does not  act  interfere  with  an
    established family life in the United Kingdom and that the sponsor  can
    continue to visit the appellant in Turkey  and  the  refusal  does  not
    interfere with the level of family  life  that  the  parties  currently
    enjoy.

17. I agree with the permission Judge that the Judge in  finding  that  the
    decision would not interfere with  the  appellant's  relationship  with
    their United Kingdom citizen sponsor as they currently exist, fell into
    material error.  The  Judge  should  have  considered  the  appellant's
    Article 8 rights pursuant to the Strasbourg jurisprudence.  The  Judges
    approach to Article 8 in the determination means that Article  8  could
    never successfully be raised in  any  entry  clearance  case  and  that
    cannot be right.

18. The Judge stated that the appellants  could  make  another  application
    without delay. The Judge thereby failed to consider the best  interests
    of the second appellant who is now  18  but  was  17  at  the  date  of
    application and who remains dependent  on  her  parents  and  would  be
    unable to reapply under the Immigration Rules.

19. There is a material error of law in  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Judge in respect of Article 8.

20. I therefore direct that the appeal be listed in the upper  Tribunal  on
    the first available date for submissions  to  be  made  in  respect  of
    Article 8. If possible, the appeal be reserved to myself.

    Hearing listed for 20 November 2015

21. On 20 November 2015, the appeal was set down for hearing submissions on
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights after the error of
    law hearing. I find it was an error of law in respect of Article 8  and
    the matter to be relisted for submissions only.

22. Before that date, the appellants' representatives wrote to the Tribunal
    on 18 November 2015 in which they asked for a withdrawal of the  appeal
    hearing listed for today. An Upper Tribunal Judge decided to leave  the
    case in the list and stated that the Presiding Judge on  the  day  will
    deal with the withdrawal or any other outstanding matters.

23. There was no appearance by the appellants or their  representatives  at
    the hearing. I satisfied myself that they had been properly  served.  I
    therefore consider their application for the appeal and accept that  it
    has been withdrawn.

Decision

24. The appeal is withdrawn and therefore dismissed
