                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                       NOTICE THAT APPEAL IS ABANDONED

1) Pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
   2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the  Upper  Tribunal
   or a Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any  form
   of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the original
   Appellant. This direction applies to, amongst others,  all  parties.  Any
   failure to comply with this direction could  give  rise  to  contempt  of
   court proceedings. I make this order because there is a slight risk  that
   publicity might create a risk for the Appellant's safety.

2) Pursuant to rule 17A of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
   2008, by letter  dated  4  November  2015  the  Respondent  notified  the
   Tribunal that on 28 October 2015 the Appellant was granted limited  leave
   to remain in the United Kingdom.

3) By reason of section 104(4B) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
   Act 2002 the Appellant's appeal should be treated a abandoned unless  the
   Appellant notifies the Tribunal that he wishes to pursue  the  appeal  on
   the ground that he is entitled to humanitarian protection.

4) In response to Directions abridging the time for notifying  the  Tribunal
   of the Appellant's intentions,  by  letter  dated  6  November  2015  the
   Appellant's solicitors notified that  Tribunal  that  the  Appellant  "is
   content for his appeal to be treated as abandoned".

5) In the premises the Appellant's appeal is abandoned.
