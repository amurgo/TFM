For the Respondent:    Mr Norton (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge M.A.Khan promulgated on the 1st September 2015 in  which
    he rejected the Appellant's appeal on asylum grounds and under Articles
    2, 3 and 8 of the ECHR.

Background

 2. The basis of the Appellant's claim is that he should be recognised as a
    refugee under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status  of  Refugees,
    on the basis that he has a well-founded  fear  of  persecution  in  Sri
    Lanka, as a result of him being gay. The Appellant's initial claim  for
    Asylum, Humanitarian Protection and/or for relief under  the  ECHR  was
    rejected in a refusal letter dated the 6th March  2015.  The  Appellant
    appealed that decision to the First-tier Tribunal, and that appeal  was
    heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M.A.  Khan  in   his   decision
    promulgated on the 1st  September  2015,  in  which  he  dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal.

 3. The Appellant sought to appeal that decision to the Upper Tribunal  and
    in the grounds of appeal, it is argued  that  there  were  inadequately
    reasoned credibility findings made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge and
    that the Judge's findings that both witnesses were "vague and  evasive"
    was  inadequately  reasoned,  as  was  the  Judge's  finding  that  the
    Appellant had made contradictory and inconsistent  statements  and  had
    changed his version of events. It is argued that  the  finding  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge at [43] that there is a "large gay  community
    in Sri Lanka and in  particular  in  Colombo  where  they  have  little
    problem with the authorities" is unsupportable, and that the finding of
    the Upper Tribunal in the case of LH and IP (gay men: risk)  Sri  Lanka
    CG [2015] UKUT that there is "a significant population  of  homosexuals
    and other LGBT individuals in Sri Lanka, in particular in Colombo"  did
    not equate with there being a large gay community and the community has
    connotations, not implied by there being a significant population.

 4. In ground 2 it is argued that  the  Judge  made  a  flawed  credibility
    finding regarding the Appellant's sexuality at [42], wherein the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge found that "the  Appellant  was  unable  to  simply
    explain his feelings as a gay person instead he went on to give details
    of his sexuality. Again with respect to Mr Spurling's submissions,  the
    Appellant was asked to explain his feelings as a gay person, he  simply
    failed to do so. I find that had he been a genuine  gay  person  as  he
    claims and been in gay relationships in Sri Lanka, South Korea and  the
    UK, he would have been able to describe his feelings in the  interview.
    The fact that he was unable to do so, indicates that the Appellant  has
    adopted a gay posture  rather  than  being  an  actual  gay  person.  I
    therefore do not believe the Appellant that  he  is  a  homosexual  gay
    person."

 5. It is argued by the Appellant  that  throughout  his  asylum  interview
    record he had given examples of where he  had  described  his  feelings
    between questions 51 and 117 and had also described his feelings within
    his witness statement. It is argued that the Judge's decision  in  this
    regard that the appellant  had  failed  to  explain  his  feelings  was
    contrary to the evidence and amounted to a  serious  error  because  it
    lead to a finding that the Appellant was not gay,  which  went  to  the
    core of his claim.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Nicholson on the 29th September 2015 on the ground that the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had stated specifically that he found that the Appellant
    was not gay because he had been unable to express his feelings as a gay
    person despite the Appellant saying that there were  numerous  examples
    of him expressing his feelings as a gay person, such that there was  an
    arguable  error  of  law.  Although  Judge  Nicholson  did  not  refuse
    permission on ground one, he stated that although the Judge had not set
    out the inconsistencies in the findings, when the decision was read  as
    a whole it was quite clear where they were.

 7. In her oral submissions before me, Miss Harris argued  that  the  Judge
    had materially erred at [42] of the determination and that he had given
    examples of where he had explained his feelings as a gay man, and  that
    the Judge's finding that he had failed to do so, was simply wrong.  She
    argued that he had expressed his feelings of how he  had  feared  being
    shunned, had an "kind of lust" and how he had not been able to  develop
    love for the opposite sex, she argued  that  the  Appellant  could  not
    realistically be expected to do more and that this was an error of  law
    that stemmed from an error of fact. She argued that an  error  in  this
    regard was material, and that it may have affected the Judge's findings
    on the credibility of the Appellant on other  matters,  in  respect  of
    matters such as the existence of an arrest warrant, as this would be  a
    significant risk factor  she  argued,  if  the  Appellant  were  to  be
    returned to Sri Lanka.

 8. She further argued in respect of ground one that the Judge had not  set
    out examples of the inconsistencies that he  found  was  said  to  have
    existed, and the Judge she argued  had  failed  to  give  adequate  and
    sufficient reasons. She further argued that the  Judge  had  not  given
    examples where the Appellant or his witness had been vague and evasive.
    She argued that the case should be  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for rehearing. She further sought to argue that  there  was  a
    difference between there being a community of gay  people  in  Colombo,
    and there being a "significant population".

 9. In his submissions on behalf of the Respondent,  Mr  Norton  sought  to
    argue that if one only looked at the first 5 ï¿½ lines of  paragraph  42,
    this may cause concern, but when looked at  the  case  throughout,  the
    Judge  had  applied  the  correct  standard  of  proof,  had   properly
    summarised the evidence and properly recorded the submissions and  that
    the  Judge  had  found  significant  credibility  issues,   given   the
    inconsistencies in the Appellant's evidence and  that  there  had  been
    clear findings  of  inconsistencies  in  respect  of  the  core  events
    regarding the attacks to which he was said to have been  subjected  to.
    He argued the Judge at [39] did not accept the Appellant had failed  to
    mention his detention on the advice of a lawyer or that  he  would  not
    have mentioned the warrant in his screening interview or have sought to
    obtain the copy of the warrant until July 2015. Further, he argued  the
    Judge had found that the documents in  the  police  report  stated  the
    Appellant was wanted for in connection with terrorist activities rather
    than a result of him being gay. Mr Norton  argued  that  the  Appellant
    being subject to persecution was found to be incredible by  the  Judge.
    However he argued that if there was an error of law, the case should be
    remitted back to the First-Tier Tribunal, not as a de novo hearing, but
    simply to determine whether he was gay, rather than whether or  not  he
    was at risk. Mr Norton further argued that if there  is  a  significant
    population of gay people in Colombo, this would amount to  a  community
    and  that  the  Judge  had  spelt  out  his  factual  findings  between
    paragraphs 38 and 41 of the decision.



My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

10. The First-tier Tribunal Judge in this case clearly found that  at  [36]
    that the Appellant's evidence  before  the  Tribunal's  was  vague  and
    evasive and that he had continued to  make  contradictory  inconsistent
    statements throughout the oral hearing, changing aspects of his case in
    relation to what he had previously stated in his  screening  interview,
    the asylum interview and his SEF statement. If the  Judge's  impression
    was that the Appellant's evidence was vague and evasive, I find that it
    was incumbent upon him to so state, but although the  Judge  has  given
    clear examples between [37] and [41] as to where the Appellant had made
    contradictory and inconsistent statements and given sufficient  reasons
    which were adequately explained within those paragraphs as  to  why  he
    rejected the Appellant's accounts of the attacks having taken place  on
    him, his detention in Sri Lanka and the existence of the arrest warrant
    and the fact that the  Judge  found  the  Appellant's  evidence  to  be
    contradictory and  inconsistent  did  not  necessarily  mean  that  the
    Appellant was being evasive or vague. The fact that the  Judge  appears
    to combine the two varying concepts, but without giving examples as  to
    how the evidence was vague or  evasive,  as  opposed  to  simply  being
    inconsistent and contradictory, has not been  adequately  explained.  A
    witness' evidence maybe contradictory and inconsistent,  without  being
    vague or evasive, and vice versa, and no proper  explanation  has  been
    given for the findings of the Appellant's evidence before the  Tribunal
    was vague or evasive. I do find that the Judge's find  in  this  regard
    was inadequately reasoned.

11. However, the more significant error I find lies at [42] of the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge. His finding that  the  Appellant  was
    simply unable to explain his feelings as a gay person  and  instead  he
    had given details of his sexual activity and that he had simply  failed
    to explain his feelings as a gay person and that had he been a  genuine
    gay person as he claims and being in gay relationships  in  Sri  Lanka,
    South Korea and the UK he would have been able to describe his feelings
    in the interview and the fact that he was unable  to  do  so  indicated
    that he adopted a gay posture rather than being an actual  gay  person,
    such that the Judge did not believe that the Appellant was a homosexual
    gay person, I find to be contrary  to  the  evidence  and  inadequately
    reasoned. The Judge in reaching the  finding  that  the  Appellant  had
    failed to explain his feelings of a gay person, has clearly  failed  to
    take into account the answers given  by  the  Appellant  in  interview,
    including at question 51 where he  described  being  fearful  of  being
    shunned by his society; the Appellant's  answer  to  question  66  when
    asked specifically "tell me how you felt around the other boys at  this
    time?" when the Appellant had answered "at some point I realised that I
    liked the boys and had a feeling for them. It developed a kind of  lust
    in my mind". Further, the  Appellant  at  question  67  when  asked  to
    describe how he felt around the other boys had stated clearly  that  "I
    could not develop a love or affection to the opposite  sex  and  having
    seen the boys and their movements and their behaviour I started  liking
    them and wanted to be physically united with them"  the  Appellant  had
    also stated in answer to question 70 that "when  I  was  liaising  with
    boys, I had a feeling of love". There is no evidence of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge having taken into consideration this  relevant  evidence
    on this issue.

12. Further, in his statement at paragraph 6 the Appellant had  stated  how
    he had liked looking at some of boys at school and how it made him feel
    shy and at paragraph 7 that he had become aware that for some people he
    felt desire as  well  as  just  friendship  and  the  people  he  found
    attractive were always boys and that he had never  had  those  kind  of
    feelings about girls. It  is  therefore  clear  and  I  find  that  the
    Appellant had  sought  to  describe  his  feelings  as  a  gay  man  in
    interview, and had gone on to further explain those feelings within his
    witness statement. The Judge's finding that the Appellant had failed to
    describe his feelings as a gay man, has not  been  adequately  reasoned
    and without clear reasons for that finding, appears to  be  unsupported
    by the evidence, given the answers the Appellant did in  fact  give  in
    interview. I therefore find that the Judge has failed to  take  account
    of material evidence in this regard, and that  his  reasoning  in  this
    regard is inadequate and insufficient.

13. Given that this error does amount to an error of law and was the  basis
    for the First-tier Tribunal Judge finding that the Appellant was not  a
    homosexual gay person and had simply adopted a gay posture rather  than
    being an actual gay person  at  [42],  although  the  Judge  has  given
    reasons for rejecting the Appellant's account regarding the two attacks
    said to have taken place against him, and for rejecting his explanation
    for not having mentioned his detention or his  failure  to  obtain  the
    arrest warrant earlier or its relevance,  given  that  the  Judge  when
    considering credibility, has to consider the evidence whollistically, I
    do not find that the Judge's error regarding the question as to whether
    or not the Appellant had described his feelings as a gay person and  as
    to whether therefore we was in fact gay, can simply  be  looked  at  in
    isolation, and that this error would not have possibly  influenced  the
    Judge's other findings. Although the question as to whether or not  the
    Appellant would be at risk as the result of him being gay,  as  opposed
    to the question as to whether or not he is gay, are separate questions,
    the Judge's findings that the Appellant was  not  gay,  may  well  have
    influenced his assessment of the relevance of the  inconsistencies  and
    the explanations given by the Appellant regarding the risk he faced  on
    return.

14. I therefore do consider that the errors in the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge, both in terms of him failing to  provide  adequate
    reasons as to why he said that the Appellant's evidence was  vague  and
    evasive, as opposed to being contradicting  and  inconsistent,  and  in
    particular his error in respect of his consideration as to  whether  or
    not the Appellant had described his feelings as a gay person at [42], I
    do consider to be material errors of law. I do  not  consider  that  in
    light of these errors, the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  findings  in
    respect of risk should remain, as  clearly  this  question  has  to  be
    considered in light of the primary question as to whether  or  not  the
    Appellant is gay. I therefore do  find  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's decision does contain material errors of  law,  should  be  set
    aside and that the case should  be  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for rehearing de novo on all aspects of the case.
