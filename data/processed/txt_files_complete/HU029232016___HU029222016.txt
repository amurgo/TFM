Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Norman
For the Respondent:    Mr Wilding


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants are citizens of Ukraine both born in  1980.   They  are
      partners.   They  entered  the  UK  with  leave  in  2002   and   2004
      respectively.  Both overstayed, the first  appellant  from  2002,  the
      second appellant from 2005.

   2. They have two children born in 2007 and 2009.  Both were born  in  the
      UK.

   3. On 22 October 2015 the appellants sought leave to remain on the  basis
      of their private and family life under paragraph 276ADE  and  Appendix
      FM of the Immigration Rules.

   4. The applications were refused on 26 January 2016.

   5. It was considered that there would not be very  significant  obstacles
      to the integration of the appellants to their home  country.   It  was
      also considered that it would not be unreasonable for the children  to
      leave the UK with their parents and live in Ukraine.

   6. They appealed.

First-Tier Hearing

   7. Following a hearing at Taylor House on 23  March  2017  Judge  of  the
      First-Tier Lucas dismissed the appeals.  His findings are at paragraph
      29ff.  In summary, he found that there would not be  very  significant
      obstacles to the parents' reintegration to life in Ukraine.

   8. As for the children, whilst they may face difficulties in adapting  to
      the life, language and  education  in  Ukraine  they  would  have  the
      support of their parents, both Ukrainian, and  their  grandparents  in
      adjusting to life there.  Their best interests  were  catered  for  by
      their remaining in the care of their parents and going to Ukraine as a
      family unit.

   9. The appellants sought permission to appeal which  was  granted  on  11
      October 2017.  The crux of the application was that in coming  to  his
      conclusions as to the reasonableness or otherwise  of  the  appellants
      returning to Ukraine with their children, the judge did not take  note
      of the respondent's guidance and case law, in particular, MA and Ors v
      SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 705. There was no engagement with s117B(6) of the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

Error of Law Hearing

  10. At the error of law hearing before  me  Mr  Wilding  agreed  with  the
      submission that the decision showed material error of law for  failing
      to pay heed to the guidance and case law.  By consent the decision was
      set aside to be remade.

  11. We were able to proceed to do so immediately.   Mr  Wilding  intimated
      that the appellants' elder child born in  2007  was  registered  as  a
      British citizen on 2 November 2017.  In light of that development  the
      respondent's position was that it would not be  reasonable  to  expect
      the children and their parents to go to Ukraine.  He  asked  that  the
      appeals be allowed.  I agreed.
