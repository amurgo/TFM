For the Appellant:     Ms Beach of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Staunton a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. The Respondent refused the Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
         remain as a spouse on 14 May 2015. He is a citizen of  Vietnam  who
         was born on 8 February 1988. He was required to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom. His spouse is [HV], a Vietnamese national, and  his  step-
         daughter is [VL] (born on 28 November 2012), a British citizen.

      2. His appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Wylie  ("the
         Judge") following a hearing on 3 February 2016.

The grant of permission

      3. Upper Tribunal  Judge  Perkins  granted  permission  to  appeal  (3
         November 2016). He said it is arguable that the  Judge  erred  when
         stating it is reasonable for [VL]  to  be  required  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom and European Union to ensure Ms [V]  could  continue
         to enjoy married life, as such a requirement may not be  lawful  in
         itself or consistent with Home Office  Policy.  He  said  that  all
         grounds could be argued.

Respondent's position

      4. In the reply notice (17 November 2016) it is said  that  the  Judge
         directed himself appropriately. Ms [V] only had  limited  leave  to
         remain. [VL] at the date of that hearing was only 3 years  old  and
         had formed no ties outside the family. Adequate reasons were  given
         for saying it would be reasonable for [VL] to leave.

Appellant's position

      5. As there is no evidence [VL]'s father is  unwilling  or  unable  to
         care for her, and it is in her best interest to remain with Ms [V],
         it would be unreasonable to require her to leave the United Kingdom
         to enjoy their family life. Consideration should have been given to
         whether the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006
         are engaged regarding derived residence rights. I  point  out  here
         that Ms Beach was unable to point me to any part of regulation  15A
         that may be of assistance to  her.  There  was  no  finding  as  to
         whether the Appellant cared for [VL] while  Ms  [V]  was  at  work.
         There were inadequate findings as to the nature of the relationship
         between [VL] and her father.

Judge's Determination

      6. It is found in the determination that,

             [20] "the appellant has a family life with  Ms  [V],  and  the
             child [VL]."

             [23] "the appellant met Ms [V] and [VL] when  he  was  in  the
             United Kingdom unlawfully; Ms [V]'s own immigration status  is
             precarious, as she only has limited leave to be in the  United
             Kingdom."

             [25] "[VL] is a British citizen... It is in her best  interest
             to be in the care of her mother, Ms [V]."

             [28] "Both the appellant and Ms [V] are Vietnam nationals. The
             appellant  has  lived  there  most  of  his  life."  Ms  [V]'s
             "passport shows visits to Vietnam between 1 January 2014 and 6
             February 2014; between 26 April 2014 and 13 March 2014; and 10
             January 2015 to  5  February  2015.  This  suggests  that  she
             continues to have ties there."

             [29] "Their soon to be  born  daughter  will  have  Vietnamese
             nationality."

             [34] "[VL] has not commenced formal education."

             [36] "She would lose direct contact with her father."

Discussion

      7. Ms Beach prayed in aid MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA  Civ  705  and  ZH
         (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4.

      8. I am  not  satisfied  that  the  Judge  adequately  considered  the
         intrinsic importance of citizenship to [VL] who  had  rights  which
         she would not be able to exercise if she moved  to  Vietnam.  There
         has been no adequate consideration to the fact that she would  lose
         the advantages of growing up and being educated here,  in  her  own
         culture (British) and language. There was no  finding  as  to  what
         language she spoke.  There is no equally assessment of whether  she
         is being denied her right to be brought up as a citizen of  Vietnam
         as there is no evidence as to whether she  is  Vietnamese  of  not.
         Whilst her level of integration here is limited  given  her  tender
         years, and nationality is not a "trump card", it is  of  particular
         importance in assessing her best interests. It is not enough to say
         that she might readily adapt to life in  Vietnam,  particularly  as
         she had lived in Britain all her life.

      9. Whilst Ms [V] and [VL] can visit the Appellant in Vietnam,  and  Ms
         [V] has been there on 3 occasions very recently and has ties  there
         which can include the Appellant, the Judge has not  considered  how
         their family life will continue in a completely different form  and
         the impact that may have on [VL].

     10. Whilst the links to her biological father were  tenuous  given  the
         limited contact, more detailed findings in relation to  that  would
         have helped to complete the picture of her life and links here.

     11. I am satisfied that there was therefore a material error of law  by
         the Judge as identified above [8-10].

     12. I agreed with both representatives that, given  the  lack  of  many
         core findings required  in  the  balancing  exercise  of  what  was
         reasonable for [VL], the matter would need to be  remitted  to  the
         First-tier Tribunal other than Judge Wylie. For  the  avoidance  of
         doubt, the findings referred to above [6] are preserved.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision.

    I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal for  rehearing  before  a
    Judge other than Judge Wylie.
