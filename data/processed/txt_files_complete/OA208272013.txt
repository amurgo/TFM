                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judges Suffield-Thompson and  Page)  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal against a decision of the ECO dated 31 October  2013
    refusing her entry clearance to join her husband, Mehmet  Aksahin  (the
    sponsor) in the United Kingdom under Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules (HC 395 as  amended).   The  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules but allowed it under Art  8  of  the
    ECHR.

 2. For convenience, I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey who was born on 28 February  1995.
    The sponsor is also a citizen of Turkey and was born on 1 June 1983.

 4. The sponsor came to the UK in 2003 and claimed  asylum.   On  23  March
    2012, the sponsor was granted discretionary leave to remain in  the  UK
    until 22 December 2014.

 5. The sponsor met the appellant in Turkey on  30  September  2012.   They
    became engaged on 10 October 2012.  The sponsor visited Turkey and they
    were married on 11 January 2013.

 6. The appellant made her application for  entry  clearance  as  a  spouse
    under Appendix FM on 24 July 2013.  On 31 October 2013, the ECO refused
    the appellant's application on the basis  that  her  sponsor  only  had
    limited leave to remain expiring on 22 December 2014 and therefore  she
    could not meet the requirement in E-ECP2.1  of  Appendix  FM  that  her
    partner was a British citizen; or was present and settled in the UK; or
    was in the UK with leave as a refugee or on the basis  of  humanitarian
    protection.

 7. The ECO's decision was upheld by  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  in  a
    decision dated 24 April 2014.

 8. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  Before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, it was  common  ground  that  the  appellant  could  not
    succeed under the  Immigration  Rules  (namely  para  ECP2.1),  as  the
    sponsor  only  had  discretionary  leave   to   remain   in   the   UK.
    Nevertheless, the Tribunal concluded  that  the  appellant's  case  was
    "exceptional" and allowed the appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR.

 9. The ECO sought permission to appeal on a  number  of  grounds.   On  12
    January 2015, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Frankish) granted the  ECO
    permission to appeal on the basis  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    arguably erred in law by failing to take into  account  s.117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "NIA Act  2002")  and
    in reaching its finding that, despite not qualifying under  the  Rules,
    there were "exceptional circumstances".

10. Thus, the appeal came before me.

The Approach to Art 8

11. The issues raised in the appeal require a consideration of the  correct
    approach to Art 8, in particular the issue of proportionality,  in  the
    light of the "new" Immigration Rules and Part 5A of the NIA  Act  2002.
    The Respondent's  argument  is  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed
    properly to apply Part 5A and reached an irrational conclusion that the
    public interest was outweighed by the  appellant's  circumstances  such
    that the refusal of entry clearance was a breach of Art 8.

12. As this is an entry clearance case, where the appellant was seeking  to
    join her husband in the UK, the First-tier  Tribunal  was  required  to
    consider whether the respondent's decision breached the  UK's  positive
    obligation under Art 8 to "respect" the private and family life of  the
    appellant and sponsor.  Although strictly Art 8.2  has  no  application
    when determining whether the "positive obligation" has  been  breached,
    the  Strasbourg  Court  has  adopted  an  analogous  analysis  to  that
    undertaken in cases involving an "interference"  with  an  individual's
    private and family life and thus directly engages Art  8.2  (see,  e.g.
    Draon v France (2006) 42 EHRR 40).  Central to  that  analysis  is  the
    issue of proportionality as it is when applying Art 8.2.  It  was  also
    the central issue for the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  determine  in  the
    appeal, namely whether the Entry Clearance  Officer's  decision  was  a
    proportionate  interference  or  disrespect  for  the   appellant   and
    sponsor's family life.  There clearly  was  'family  life'  established
    between them and the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  would,  at
    least, have some impact upon (or interference with)  their  ability  to
    carry on  that  family  life  in  the  future.   The  decision  was  in
    accordance with the law, namely the Immigration Rules and made for  the
    purpose of a legitimate aim, namely the  economic  well  being  of  the
    country and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (or, as
    it is often stated in this context effective immigration control) (see,
    Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 85 (IAC)).

13. In determining proportionality, there  is  a  two-stage  approach  (see
    Singh and Khalid v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ  74).   First,  a  Tribunal  is
    required to consider whether the  appellant  could  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  As I have already indicated, in this appeal it  was
    common ground between the parties that she could not do so because  the
    sponsor only had discretionary leave.  Secondly,  a  Tribunal  is  then
    required to consider whether an appellant should  succeed  outside  the
    Immigration Rules under Art 8 because the public interest, reflected in
    the fact that the appellant could not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules, is outweighed by the individual circumstances.

14. The issue of proportionality involves, as Lord Bingham of Cornhill said
    in R (Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 at [20]:

         "... involves the striking of a fair balance between the rights  of
         the individual and the interests of the community which is inherent
         in the whole of the Convention".

15. That decision has to be made in the context of the detailed Immigration
    Rules (introduced by HC 194 and numerous subsequent amendments  from  9
    July  2012)  dealing  with  Art  8  which  represent  a  particularised
    statement of policy balancing  the  interests  of  immigration  control
    against the rights and interests of individuals  wishing  to  enter  or
    remain in the UK (see Haleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ  558  at  [40]
    per Beatson LJ).  Those Rules are to be found principally  in  Appendix
    FM (family life) and para 276ADE (private life).   Paragraphs  A398-400
    deal with deportation and are not relevant to this appeal.   The  scope
    of the enquiry at the second stage will depend upon the circumstance of
    the  particular  case  including  whether  the  issues  raised  by  the
    appellant have been addressed under the Rules (see Singh and Khalid  at
    [64] per Underhill LJ).

16. The voluminous (and ever increasing) body of  cases  that  has  emerged
    both from the Upper Tribunal and the higher courts makes plain that  in
    assessing proportionality,  and  in  particular  balancing  the  public
    interest against the rights of others, the public interest reflected in
    the Rules is entitled to significant weight. That is particularly so in
    deportation cases but, albeit to a lesser extent, is also important  in
    removal and entry clearance cases.  The assessment must  be  undertaken
    "through their lens" (see AJ (Angola) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ  1636  per
    Sales LJ at [40]).  The case  law  identifies  the  need  to  establish
    "exceptional" or "compelling" circumstances not sufficiently recognised
    under the Rules in order to find that the public interest is outweighed
    (see, e.g. MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 (deportation);  and
    R (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) (refusal of  leave)).   Whilst
    the test is not one of "exceptionality" (see Huang v SSHD  [2007]  UKHL
    11; Cf SS (Congo) below), the importance and weight to be given to  the
    public interest where an  individual  cannot  satisfy  the  Immigration
    Rules, is  reflected  in  the  court's  recognition  that  "compelling"
    circumstances are required to outweigh the public interest  or,  as  it
    sometimes glossed, there must  be  "unjustifiably  harsh  consequences"
    before the public interest is outweighed (see Gulshan (Article 8 -  new
    Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC)).  In Chege  (section
    117D  -  Article  8  -  approach)  [2015]  UKUT  165  (IAC)  the   word
    "compelling" was stated to mean:

         "having a powerful and irresistible effect; convincing".

17. The new Part 5A of  the  NIA  Act  2002  (introduced  by  s.19  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014 with  effect  from  28  July  2014)  adds  further
    legislative  intervention  to  the  exercise  to  be  undertaken   when
    assessing proportionality ("the public  interest  question"  under  art
    8.2) (s.117A(1) and (3)). By virtue of s.117A(2)(a) in determining that
    issue a

         "... court or tribunal must (in particular) have regard -

               i. in all cases, to  the  considerations  listed  in  section
                  117B, ..... "

    (Section  117C  sets  out  additional  considerations  in  relation  to
    deportation cases involving "foreign criminals" and is not relevant  to
    this appeal.)

18. Section 117B of the NIA Act 2002 provides as follows:

         "117B  Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in  all
         cases

             (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
                  the public interest.

             (2)  It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
                  interests  of  the  economic  well-being  of  the   United
                  Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain  in  the
                  United Kingdom are able to speak English, because  persons
                  who can speak English -

                  (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

             (3)  It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
                  interests  of  the  economic  well-being  of  the   United
                  Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain  in  the
                  United Kingdom are financially independent,  because  such
                  persons -

                  (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

             (4)  Little weight should be given to -

                  (a)  a private life, or

                  (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that
                  is established by a person at a time when the person is in
                  the United Kingdom unlawfully.

             (5)   Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private   life
                  established by a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's
                  immigration status is precarious.

             (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
                  the public interest does not require the person's  removal
                  where -

                  (a)  the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

                  (b)  it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                  leave the United Kingdom."

19. The factors set out in s.117B are to be taken into account as  part  of
    the proportionality assessment  (see  Dube  (ss117A-117D)  [2015]  UKUT
    00090 (IAC) and Chege (section 117D - Article 8 - approach) [2015] UKUT
    165 (IAC)).  The tribunal need not necessarily  refer  specifically  to
    s.117B (and 117C if relevant) providing that the factors are taken into
    account: what is important is 'substance' and not 'form' (see Dube).

20. In the recent decision of SSHD v SS (Congo) and others [2015] EWCA  Civ
    387 Richards, Underhill and Sales LJJ), the Court of Appeal  considered
    the proper approach  to  Art  8  including,  in  particular,  where  an
    individual seeks entry clearance or leave to enter ("LTE").  The  Court
    drew together the threads of the existing case law.

21.  The  cases  concerned  applications  for  entry  clearance  where  the
    appellant could not establish that he or she  satisfied  the  financial
    requirements in Appendix FM.  Having considered the case  law  in  some
    detail, the Court of  Appeal  concluded  as  follows  at  [39]  of  its
    judgment:

         "39. In our judgment, the position under Article 8 in  relation  to
             an application for LTE on the basis  of  family  life  with  a
             person already in the United Kingdom is as follows:

             i)   A person outside the United Kingdom may have a good claim
                  under Article 8 to be allowed to enter the United  Kingdom
                  to join family members already here so as to  continue  or
                  develop existing family life: see e.g. G�l  v  Switzerland
                  (1996) 22 EHRR 93 and Sen v Netherlands (2001) 36 EHRR  7.
                  Article 8 does not confer an  automatic  right  of  entry,
                  however.  Article 8 imposes no  general  obligation  on  a
                  state to facilitate the choice made by a married couple to
                  reside in it: R (Quila) v Secretary of State for the  Home
                  Department [2011] UKSC 45; [2012] 1 AC  621,  para.  [42];
                  Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v United Kingdom  (1985)
                  7 EHRR 471, [68]; G�l v Switzerland, [38].  The  state  is
                  entitled to control immigration: Huang, para. [18].

             ii)  The approach to identifying  positive  obligations  under
                  Article 8(1) draws on Article 8(2) by analogy, but is  not
                  identical with analysis under Article 8(2):  see,  in  the
                  immigration context, Abdulaziz, Cabales and  Balkandali  v
                  United Kingdom, paras. [67]-[68]; G�l v Switzerland, [38];
                  and Sen v Netherlands [31]-[32].   See  also  the  general
                  guidance on the applicable principles given by  the  Grand
                  Chamber of the ECtHR in Draon v France (2006) 42  EHRR  40
                  at paras.  [105]-[108],  summarising  the  effect  of  the
                  leading authorities as follows (omitting footnotes):

                      "105.    While the essential object of  Art.8  is  to
                             protect  the   individual   against   arbitrary
                             interference by the public authorities, it does
                             not merely require the State  to  abstain  from
                             such interference: there  may  in  addition  be
                             positive  obligations  inherent  in   effective
                             "respect"  for  family  life.   The  boundaries
                             between  the  State's  positive  and   negative
                             obligations under the provision do  not  always
                             lend   themselves   to   precise    definition;
                             nonetheless,  the  applicable  principles   are
                             similar.  In both contexts regard must  be  had
                             to the fair  balance  that  has  to  be  struck
                             between  the   competing   interests   of   the
                             individual and the community as a whole, and in
                             both  contexts  the  State  is  recognised   as
                             enjoying  a  certain  margin  of  appreciation.
                             Furthermore, even in relation to  the  positive
                             obligations flowing from the  first  paragraph,
                             "in striking [the required]  balance  the  aims
                             mentioned in the second paragraph may be  of  a
                             certain relevance".

                      106.  "Respect"  for  family  life  ...  implies   an
                             obligation for the State to  act  in  a  manner
                             calculated  to   allow   ties   between   close
                             relatives to develop normally.  The  Court  has
                             held  that  a  state  is  under  this  type  of
                             obligation where it  has  found  a  direct  and
                             immediate link between the  measures  requested
                             by an applicant,  on  the  one  hand,  and  his
                             private and/or family life on the other.

                      107. However, since the concept  of  respect  is  not
                             precisely defined, states enjoy a  wide  margin
                             of appreciation in determining the steps to  be
                             taken to ensure compliance with the  Convention
                             with due regard to the needs and  resources  of
                             the community and of individuals.

                      108. At the  same  time,  the  Court  reiterates  the
                             fundamentally   subsidiary    role    of    the
                             Convention.   The  national  authorities   have
                             direct democratic legitimation and are, as  the
                             Court has held on many occasions, in  principle
                             better placed than an  international  court  to
                             evaluate  local  needs  and   conditions.    In
                             matters of general policy,  on  which  opinions
                             within  a  democratic  society  may  reasonably
                             differ widely, the role of the domestic policy-
                             maker should be given special weight."

             iii) In deciding whether to  grant  LTE  to  a  family  member
                  outside the United Kingdom, the state authorities may have
                  regard to a range of factors, including the pressure which
                  admission of an applicant may place upon public resources,
                  the  desirability  of  promoting  social  integration  and
                  harmony and so forth.  Refusal of LTE in cases where these
                  interests may be undermined may be fair and  proportionate
                  to the legitimate interests identified in Article 8(2)  of
                  "the  economic  well-being  of  the  country"   and   "the
                  protection  of  the  rights  and   freedoms   of   others"
                  (taxpayers and members of  society  generally).   A  court
                  will be slow to find an implied positive obligation  which
                  would involve imposing on the state significant additional
                  expenditure, which will necessarily involve a diversion of
                  resources from other activities of the state in the public
                  interest, a matter which usually calls  for  consideration
                  under democratic procedures.

             iv)  On the other hand, the fact that the interests of a child
                  are in issue will be a countervailing factor  which  tends
                  to reduce to some  degree  the  width  of  the  margin  of
                  appreciation which the state authorities  would  otherwise
                  enjoy.  Article 8 has to be interpreted and applied in the
                  light of the UN Convention on  the  Rights  of  the  Child
                  (1989): see In re E (Children) (Abduction: Custody Appeal)
                  [2011] UKSC 27; [2012] AC 144, at [26].  However, the fact
                  that the interests of a child are in issue does not simply
                  provide a  trump  card  so  that  a  child  applicant  for
                  positive action to be taken by the state in the  field  of
                  Article 8(1) must always have  their  application  acceded
                  to; see In re E (Children) at [12]  and  ZH  (Tanzania)  v
                  Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC  4;
                  [2011] 2 AC 166, at [25] (under Article  3(1)  of  the  UN
                  Convention on the Rights of the Child the interests of the
                  child are a primary  consideration  -  i.e.  an  important
                  matter - not the primary consideration).  It is  a  factor
                  relevant to the fair balance between  the  individual  and
                  the  general  community  which  goes  some   way   towards
                  tempering  the  otherwise  wide  margin  of   appreciation
                  available to the state authorities in deciding what to do.
                   The age of the child, the closeness of their relationship
                  with the other family member in  the  United  Kingdom  and
                  whether the  family  could  live  together  elsewhere  are
                  likely to be important factors which should  be  borne  in
                  mind.

             v)   If family  life  can  be  carried  on  elsewhere,  it  is
                  unlikely that "a direct and  immediate  link"  will  exist
                  between the measures requested by  an  applicant  and  his
                  family life (Draon, para. [106]; Botta v Italy  (1998)  26
                  EHRR 241, para. [35]), such as to provide the basis for an
                  implied obligation upon the state under  Article  8(1)  to
                  grant LTE; see also G�l v Switzerland, [42]. "

22. The Court of Appeal then concluded at ([40]-[41]) that in LTE cases the
    correct test was "compelling circumstances" and  contrasted  that  with
    "exceptionality" or "very compelling  circumstances"  in  the  case  of
    precarious family relationships and deportation cases:

         "40. In the light of these authorities, we consider that the  state
             has  a  wider  margin  of  appreciation  in  determining   the
             conditions to be satisfied before LTE is granted,  by  contact
             with the position in relation to decisions regarding  LTR  for
             persons  with   a   (non-precarious)   family   life   already
             established in the United Kingdom.  The Secretary of State has
             already, in effect, made some use  of  this  wider  margin  of
             appreciation by excluding section EX.1 as a basis for grant of
             LTE, although it is available as a basis  for  grant  of  LTR.
             The  LTE  Rules  therefore  maintain,  in  general  terms,   a
             reasonable relationship with the requirements of Article 8  in
             the ordinary run of cases.  However, it  remains  possible  to
             imagine cases where the individual interests at stake are of a
             particularly pressing nature so that a good claim for LTE  can
             be  established  outside  the  Rules.   In   our   view,   the
             appropriate general formulation for this category is that such
             cases will arise where an applicant  for  LTE  can  show  that
             compelling circumstances exist  (which  are  not  sufficiently
             recognised under the new Rules) to require the grant  of  such
             leave.

         41.  This formulation is aligned to that proposed in Nagre at  [29]
             in relation to the general position  in  respect  of  the  new
             Rules for LTR, which was adopted in this court in  Haleemudeen
             at [44].  It  is  a  fairly  demanding  test,  reflecting  the
             reasonable relationship between the Rules themselves  and  the
             proper outcome of application of Article 8 in the usual run of
             cases.  But, contrary to the submission of Mr Payne, it is not
             as  demanding  as  the  exceptionality  or  "very   compelling
             circumstances"  test  applicable  in  the   special   contexts
             explained  in   MF   (Nigeria)   (precariousness   of   family
             relationship  and  deportation  of  foreigners  convicted   of
             serious crimes)".

23. The Court of Appeal did not consider the impact of Part 5A of  the  NIA
    Act 2002 (namely ss.117A-D)  as  the  appeal  decision  predated  those
    provisions coming into force on  28  July  2014.   As  I  have  already
    pointed out, those "considerations" become  relevant  when  determining
    whether  the  individual  circumstances   are   "compelling"   or,   if
    appropriate,  "exceptional"  or  "very  compelling"  (the  latter   two
    applying in 'precarious family cases' and deportation appeals).

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

24. With that law in mind, I now turn to the First-tier Tribunal's  reasons
    for allowing the appeal under Art 8.

25. The basis of the  appellant's  case  was  set  out  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal at para 11 of its determination as follows:

         "11. The appellant's case is set out in her court bundle  and  also
             by virtue of the  evidence  given  orally  in  court  (via  an
             interpreter) from her sponsor.   She  set  out  her  claim  as
             follows:

             (a)  The appellant married the sponsor on 11 January 2013,  in
                  Turkey.

             (b)  The sponsor was given Discretionary leave to stay in  the
                  UK on the 23 February  2012  (sic  March  2012)  until  22
                  December 2012 (sic 2014).

             (c)  The sponsor has his own business here in the UK.  He is a
                  hairdresser and is self-employed.

             (d)  The sponsor owns his own home subject to  a  mortgage  of
                  �66,000.

             (e)  Her sponsor has sufficient monies and  accommodation  for
                  her to live in the  UK  without  having  recourse  to  the
                  public purse.

             (f)  The sponsor has worked very hard to build a  life  and  a
                  business in the UK and wishes to remain here permanently.

             (g)  The sponsor earns  in  excess  of  the  �18,600  the  sum
                  required under Appendix FM for the  settlement  under  the
                  Immigration rules".

26. Before the FtT, the respondent did not doubt  the  genuineness  of  the
    parties' relationship (see para 13 of the determination).

27. At paras 15-19, the First-tier Tribunal made a number  of  findings  as
    follows:

         "15. We find the sponsor to be a credible  witness  who  wishes  to
             remain in the UK and further that he is a hard working  person
             who is contributing to both the economy and  UK  society.   On
             this basis we do not find that it is viable for him to have  a
             family life in Turkey as his thriving  business  and  property
             are here and he has no immediate means of  supporting  himself
             or his wife if he leaves these behind.

         16.  We find that the appellant has an  arguable  claim  under  the
             ECHR, Article 8.  The sponsor has been allowed to stay in  the
             UK and build up  a  business  which  is  contributing  to  the
             economy.  He is in no way dependent on the state and  has  the
             funds  to  support  the  appellant  and   provide   her   with
             appropriate accommodation.  It is highly unlikely he  will  be
             refused further leave in December as he has not committed  any
             criminal offences nor behaved in a way that is contrary to the
             public good during his stay in the UK to date.  We  find  that
             he has a reasonable expectation that he  will  be  allowed  to
             remain here for another 3 years and achieve  indefinite  leave
             to remain thereafter.

         17.  We have been assisted in our decision by case law.   The  case
             of  Beoku-Betts  v  SSHD  [2008]  UKHL  39   clarified   that,
             notwithstanding the narrow wording of the ECHR, it  should  be
             construed widely and the family unit considered as a whole for
             Article 8 purpose.  Baroness Hale (paragraph 4)  said  that  a
             narrow approach is not only artificial and  impracticable  but
             "risks missing the central point about family life,  which  is
             that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."

         18.  The House of Lords, in Beoku-Betts, upheld  an  argument  that
             family members enjoy a single family life  so  when  making  a
             decision its effect upon all the  family  members  has  to  be
             looked at.  We must ask whether it is proportionate to keep  a
             couple apart in a situation where the appellant has to wait at
             least a further three years to join her  husband  and  in  the
             meantime  spend  significant  amounts  of   time   and   money
             travelling to and from Turkey to maintain a genuine  marriage?
             This Tribunal finds it is not.

         19.  Finally we find there is no public interest ground in  keeping
             the appellant and the sponsor apart".

28. As can be seen, the First-tier Tribunal  found  that  the  sponsor  was
    working in the UK and that  neither  he  nor  the  appellant  would  be
    dependent on the state if the appellant lived in the UK.  The  Tribunal
    also found that there was a "reasonable expectation" that the sponsor's
    three year discretionary leave would be renewed for another three years
    and that he would achieve indefinite leave to remain thereafter.

29. At paras 20-26 under the heading "Conclusion" the  First-tier  Tribunal
    reached the following conclusions in relation to Art 8:

         "20. After considering all of the evidence before us, including the
             evidence not specifically referred to in  this  determination,
             we have reached the following conclusions in this case.

         21.   The  appellant  does  not  meet  the  requirements   of   the
             Immigration Rules.

         22.  The appellant and the sponsor, as a  married  couple,  have  a
             right to enjoy their family life.  This cannot be the case  if
             he is to stay living and  working,  legally,  in  the  UK  for
             another three years and the appellant has to remain in Turkey.
              The ECtHR has ruled that "a lawful and genuine" marriage does
             amount to family life, even if the couple  has  not  yet  been
             able to establish a home together.   (Abdulaziz,  Cabales  and
             Balkandali v UK and Berrehab v Netherlands).

         23.  We  find  her  circumstances  to  be  exceptional.   It  is  a
             disproportionate  response  to  the  legitimate  aims  of  the
             Immigrations rules to refuse her entry.  The  public  interest
             effect of immigrations control is, in this  claim,  outweighed
             in these particular circumstances and we rely on Article 8  to
             make this finding.

         24.  The sponsor is being treated exceptionally outside  the  rules
             but the appellant herself is not.  We  were  assisted  by  the
             case of MF (Nigeria) and Article 8 of the ECHR  we  find  that
             this case fulfils the "exceptional criteria".

         25.  We dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.  Her appeal
             did not meet the criteria set out in them and her appeal under
             the rules is dismissed.

         26.  We allow the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR".

The Submissions

30. Mr Richards submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  had  made  a  clear
    material error of law in para 19 when it had stated that there was  "no
    public interest ground in keeping the appellant and the sponsor apart".
     He submitted that that was contrary to what was stated in s.117B(1) of
    the NIA Act  2002  that:  "the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    controls is in the public interest".  Secondly, he submitted  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal had irrationally  concluded  that  the  appellant's
    circumstances were "exceptional".  He submitted that the appellant  and
    sponsor had married at a time when it was clear  that  his  immigration
    status in the UK was "precarious" as he only had  discretionary  leave.
    Mr Richards submitted that  there  was  nothing  "exceptional"  in  the
    appellant's circumstances and that the  First-tier  Tribunal's  finding
    was, in effect, that the Immigration Rules breached Art 8 because  they
    did not contain a provision allowing a spouse to join a sponsor in  the
    UK who only has discretionary leave.  Mr Richards  submitted  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal was not entitled to  ride  "rough  shod"  over  the
    Immigration Rules in that way.  He invited me to find that there was  a
    material error of law and to reverse the decision so as to dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal under Art 8.

31. On behalf of the appellant, Ms Bayoumi  relied  upon  her  helpful  and
    detailed skeleton argument which she developed in her oral submissions.



32. First, she relied upon the Upper Tribunal's decision in Dube  (ss.117A-
    117D) [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC) that it was not necessary for a  Tribunal
    to make specific reference to the  "considerations"  listed  in  s.117B
    providing that the relevant  issues  were,  in  substance,  taken  into
    account by the Tribunal.  She submitted that the Tribunal had  done  so
    and had not, in para 19, wrongly concluded that there  was  "no  public
    interest".  She submitted that the Tribunal had  specifically  referred
    to the balancing exercise  and  the  public  interest  in  "immigration
    control" in para 23 of its determination.

33. Secondly, Ms Bayoumi submitted that the Tribunal was entitled  to  find
    that the appellant's circumstances were "exceptional".  Its  conclusion
    was not irrational on the basis of: (a) the sponsor's  status  and  the
    Tribunal was entitled to take into account that his leave was likely to
    be renewed; and (b) the sponsor's circumstances,  namely  that  he  had
    built up a business and that he had no immediate  means  of  supporting
    him and the appellant if he returned to Turkey to continue family  life
    with her.  There was no public interest in keeping  the  appellant  and
    sponsor apart.

34. Ms Bayoumi submitted that the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  should
    stand.  However, looking at all the circumstances, on the basis of  the
    First-tier Tribunal's findings, any remaking  of  the  decision  should
    again result in the appeal being allowed.

Discussion

35. In my judgment, the First-tier Tribunal failed  to  apply  the  correct
    approach to Art 8 in both respects relied upon by Mr Richards.

36. First, it is clear that the Tribunal did misdirect itself in para 19 of
    its determination by stating that: "there is no public interest  ground
    in keeping the appellant and sponsor apart". There clearly was a public
    interest engaged in relation to the appellant.  S.117B makes plain that
    the "maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the  public
    interest".  Here, the appellant could not meet the requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules and in the light of  that,  the  public  interest  in
    effective  immigration  control  was  engaged.   I  do  not  accept  Ms
    Bayoumi's submission that para 19 when read with para 23 makes it clear
    that the Tribunal in para 19 was only stating a conclusion - in  effect
    its assessment of the balance to be struck between the public  interest
    and  the  appellant  and  sponsor's  private  and  family  life.    The
    Tribunal's view in para 19 is expressed in its "findings" prior  to  it
    engaging, to the limited extent it  did  in  paras  23  and  24,  in  a
    balancing exercise in determining the issue  of  proportionality  under
    Art 8.

37. Secondly, and in any event, the First-tier Tribunal's  conclusion  that
    the  appellant's  circumstances  were  "exceptional"  cannot  withstand
    analysis.  This was a case where the Secretary of  State  had,  in  the
    Rules, excluded individuals such as the appellant who wished to join  a
    sponsor who had only limited or discretionary leave to  remain  in  the
    UK.  As a consequence, the Tribunal was required to  find  "compelling"
    circumstances.  Ms Bayoumi relied upon the sponsor's immigration status
    and that it might be renewed and the appellant's circumstances,  namely
    that he had established business in the  UK  and  would  not  have  any
    "immediate means" of supporting him and his  wife  in  Turkey.   In  my
    judgment,   those   circumstances   cannot   amount   to   "compelling"
    circumstances.

38. The sponsor's immigration status was the very category  of  case  which
    the Secretary of State had concluded should not lead to  the  grant  of
    entry clearance to a spouse.  It was simply  not  compelling  that  the
    sponsor's leave might in  the  future  (whether  he  had  a  reasonable
    expectation of it or not) be extended.

39. Further, the fact that the sponsor had developed a "thriving  business"
    and  "had  property"  in  the  UK  could  not  constitute  "compelling"
    circumstances.   Of  course,  his   and   the   appellant's   financial
    independence was a relevant factor (s.117B(3)).  However,  the  sponsor
    only had leave to remain in the UK since March  2012.   Previously,  he
    was  an  unsuccessful  asylum-seeker.   His  private  life   has   been
    established largely at a time when he was not here lawfully and when he
    has been here lawfully  his  status  has  been  "precarious".   Section
    117B(4) and (5)  requires that "little weight" should be given  to  the
    sponsor's private life formed in those circumstances.  The  fact  that,
    on the Tribunal's finding, he would not have the "immediate  means"  of
    supporting himself and his wife in Turkey, could  also  not  constitute
    compelling circumstances.  In fact, that finding is difficult,  if  not
    impossible, to square with the fact that he is a Turkish  national  and
    there is  no  reason  or  persuasive  supporting  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal for it to consider that he could not re-establish  himself  in
    his own country (personally and in business) where his parents continue
    to live even though he had been in the UK since  2003  and  has  family
    here also.

40. Also, the appellant and sponsor married at a time  when  the  appellant
    and she knew his immigration status was "precarious".  It  is  no  less
    "precarious" because he will have an opportunity to apply to extend his
    leave.  That is an application yet to  be  made  or  determined.   They
    married, in other words, at a time when the appellant knew she  had  no
    right to come to the UK.  Art 8 does not create a right for  a  married
    couple to choose the  state  in  which  they  wish  to  live.   As  the
    Strasbourg case law, and SS(Congo)  above  recognises,  in  'precarious
    status' cases only exceptionally will a claim under Art 8 succeed.

41. In SS (Congo) the Court of Appeal in a similar context raised in one of
    the appeals considered by it said this (at [87]):

         "In fact, the marriage was entered into at a time when it was known
         that FA had no right to come to the United Kingdom; moreover, there
         is no impediment to the husband going to continue family life  with
         her in Uganda.  The fact that he would lose his job in  the  United
         Kingdom and hence would prefer to establish family life  here  does
         not constitute compelling circumstances requiring the grant of  LTE
         outside the Rules: as the authorities make clear,  Article  8  does
         not create a right for married couples  to  choose  to  live  in  a
         Contracting State".

42. In my judgment, those words,  adjusted  to  cover  the  fact  that  the
    appellant and sponsor come from Turkey, are equally apt in this appeal.



43. This is also a case  which  more  aptly  can  be  said  to  engage  the
    "positive obligation" (rather than the "negative obligation") of the UK
    under Art 8.  The Strasbourg jurisprudence, accepted by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in SS (Congo), recognises that in such cases the  state  has  "a
    wider margin of appreciation" in determining  the  conditions  for  the
    grant of entry clearance for leave to enter.   That  was  done  in  the
    Immigration Rules  so  as  to  exclude  the  appellant's  circumstances
    because of her sponsor's immigration status.

44. Challenges based upon irrationality are frequently made but  much  less
    frequently  succeed.   That  is  because  a  finding  of  irrationality
    requires an appellate Tribunal to conclude that the finding is

         "... so outrageous in its defiance of logic ...  that  no  sensible
         person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could
         have arrived at it"

    (see Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the  Civil  Service
    [1985] 1 AC 374 at page 410 per Lord Diplock.)

45. In my judgment, for the reasons I have given, the First-tier Tribunal's
    conclusion that there were "exceptional" circumstances to  justify  the
    grant of leave outside the Rules under Art 8  was  irrational.   In  my
    judgment, the Tribunal was not entitled to  conclude  that  "compelling
    circumstances exist[ed] (which are not  sufficiently  recognised  under
    the new Rules) to require the grant of such leave" (see SS  (Congo)  at
    [40]).

46. For these reasons, therefore, the First-tier Tribunal materially  erred
    in law in allowing the appellant's appeal under  Art  8.   I  set  that
    decision aside.

47. The only proper conclusion that the Tribunal could have reached on  the
    basis of the appellant's circumstances was that she had not established
    "compelling" circumstances to justify the grant of  leave  outside  the
    Rules under Art 8.  The fact that the sponsor's leave has  subsequently
    been renewed cannot be taken into account as I can  only  consider  the
    "circumstances appertaining at the time of decision" (see ss.85(5)  and
    85A(2), NIA Act 2002).  Even if I could take it into account, it  would
    not have made good the appellant's claim that  there  are  "compelling"
    circumstances.

48. Consequently, I remake the decision dismissing the  appellant's  appeal
    both under the Immigration Rules and Art 8.
