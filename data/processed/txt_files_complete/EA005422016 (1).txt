                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr. T. Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1.     The Appellant is a national of  Nigeria,  born  on  14.2.76.  He
    applied for a residence card as confirmation of a right  to  reside  in
    the United Kingdom as a person in a durable relationship  with  an  EEA
    national. This application was refused by the Respondent in a  decision
    dated 24.12.15, with reference to regulation  8(5)  and  17(4)  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

    2.     His appeal came before First tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cameron  for
    hearing on the papers  on  24.4.17.  The  Judge  took  account  of  the
    decision in Sala (EFMs: right of appeal) [2016] UKUT  00411  (IAC)  and
    found there was no right of appeal and proceeded to dismiss the  appeal
    for want of jurisdiction.

    3.     An  application  for  permission  to  appeal  was  made  by  the
    Appellant, who is unrepresented, two days out of time.  In  a  decision
    dated 10.1.18, Judge of the First tier Tribunal Osborne extended  time,
    in the interests of justice and granted permission  to  appeal  on  the
    basis that the decision in Sala (op cit) had been  overturned  and  the
    Appellant is entitled to have his appeal re-listed.

    4.     No rule 24 response was filed by  the  Respondent  but,  at  the
    hearing before me, Mr Melvin accepted that in light of the decision  in
    Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755,  Sala  had  been  wrongly  decided  and  the
    appropriate course was for the appeal to be remitted back to the  First
    tier Tribunal for a substantive hearing.

    Decision

    5.     In light of a material change in the jurisprudence, the decision
    of First tier Tribunal Judge Cameron contains a material error  of  law
    viz that he had no jurisdiction to hear the  appeal  in  light  of  the
    decision in Sala (op cit).

    6.     I remit the appeal for a substantive hearing  before  the  First
    tier Tribunal.
