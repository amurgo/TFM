Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Adam Pipe (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr David Mills (Senior HOPO)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of India, who  was  born  on  24th
    February 1994.  She applied for entry clearance to  join  her  husband,
    Kasim Sheikh, under the partner route in Appendix FM of the Immigration
    Rules.  The Respondent refused that application on 28th September  2015
    on the basis that the Sponsor did not have the gross annual  income  of
    at least �18,600.

The Hearing

 2. At the hearing the judge had the evidence submitted by the Appellant of
    the Sponsor's pay slips, a P60, bank  statements,  and  a  letter  from
    Connect Distribution, where the Sponsor worked.

 3. The judge during the course of the hearing stated that, "At the end  of
    the hearing I gave a preliminary view that in  view  of  the  fact  the
    Respondent was conceding  that  the  Sponsor  met  the  Minimum  Income
    Requirement, I hoped that I might be in a position to  look  favourably
    on the Appellant's claim" (paragraph 3).  However, the judge  went  on,
    to then conclude that this was a "near miss" case whereby the Appellant
    could not succeed.

 4. In so concluding, the judge  recognised  that  the  Sponsor's  combined
    total gross income was �19,695 (see paragraph 7).  However, there was a
    single bank statement missing which did not comply with  the  Sponsor's
    P60 for the year ended April 2015.  The judge went on to refer duly  to
    Appendix FM-SE and, what is referred to as the "evidential flexibility"
    Rule, and noted the submissions made by Mr Manzoor  Hussain,  appearing
    on behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State, that it was open to the
    Respondent to have  requested  the  missing  bank  statement  from  the
    Appellant because the  bank  statement  existed  at  the  time  of  the
    application and could be considered (see paragraph 8).


Submissions


 5. Appearing before me on 13th July 2017, Mr Mills, appearing on behalf of
    the Respondent, stated that the minutes of notes  made  by  Mr  Manzoor
    Hussain on the day of the hearing, clearly shows that he was  conceding
    that the Appellant did comply with the requirement  of  the  Rules  and
    that the minimum threshold income of �18,600 could  be  verified.   The
    only barrier was the missing bank statement.  It was open to the  judge
    to resolve this by exercising the jurisdiction  under  the  "evidential
    flexibility" Rules, which the judge had expressly set out at page 4  of
    the determination, where he refers to the "sequence of documents"  that
    may be missing, in which the reference to  a  "bank  statement  from  a
    series" is clearly mentioned (at paragraph 8).  Mr Mills submitted that
    the appropriate course of action now was to make a finding of an  error
    of law and to allow the appeal outright.

 6. I have accepted the concessions made both by Mr Manzoor Hussain at  the
    hearing before Judge A.M.S. Green, and more relevantly, the  concession
    made by Mr Mills before this Tribunal.

 7. I find that the judge materially erred  in  law  as  contended  in  the
    grounds seeking permission to  appeal.   The  "evidential  flexibility"
    jurisdiction exists precisely for this kind of case and ought  to  have
    been exercised, particularly as the concession was made by  Mr  Manzoor
    Hussain at the time of the hearing.

 8. I remake the decision on the basis of  the  findings  of  the  original
    judge, and the evidence before him, and the  submissions  that  I  have
    heard today.  I have decided to allow this appeal.





Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal is  allowed.


No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have made a fee award of any fee which has been paid or may be payable.
