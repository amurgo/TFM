                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly.  This order  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.   Any
failure to comply with this order could  give  rise  to  contempt  of  court
proceedings.

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Telford, who  on  12  January  2018,  dismissed  an
    appeal against the respondent's refusal to grant her  and  her  British
    citizen daughter visas to  join  the  sponsor,  a  British  citizen  of
    Nigerian origin, here in the United Kingdom.  The  parties'  child  was
    conceived during a visit to the United Kingdom but was born in  Nigeria
    and has never visited or lived here: she is not an  appellant  in  this
    appeal, although its outcome affects her.

 2. During the course of the First-tier Tribunal  hearing  the  appellants'
    assertion that the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as
    amended) could be met was abandoned and the appeal proceeded solely  on
    the basis of Article 8 outside the Rules in  relation  to  the  British
    citizen child, who is now nearly 3 years old, and still lives with  her
    mother in Nigeria.

 3. The sponsor has visited his wife and daughter regularly in Nigeria  and
    he also has two other children by a former relationship who  live  with
    their own mother and not with the sponsor.   The  child  was  conceived
    while the appellant was in the United Kingdom on a multiple entry visit
    visa, returning properly within the currency of that visa.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the First-tier Judge
    had arguably erred in relation to the minimum  income  requirement,  in
    holding that the British citizen child required entry clearance,  which
    of course she does not, and in failing to  consider  the  child's  best
    interests pursuant to Section 55 of the Borders Act.

 5. On 21 December 2018,  I  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ordering that it be remade in the  Upper  Tribunal  and  noted
    that evidence in the form of bank statements and company documents  had
    been served, which were said to be evidence that the sponsor could meet
    the �18,600 income requirement for the appellant to join  him  here  as
    his spouse.  There had not been time for those documents to be analysed
    or for the respondent to consider them properly.

 6. At the hearing today, Ms Heybroek for the appellant accepted  that  the
    documents produced in December 2018 were not the required documents for
    Appendix FM-SE and that the Rules still cannot be met.

 7. Ms Heybroek further accepted that the  Section  55  obligation  on  the
    United  Kingdom  relates  only  to  children   who   are   within   the
    jurisdiction, but asserted that there is a generic  statutory  duty  in
    relation British citizen children which she was unable to locate in any
    particular statute.  It is right, of course,  that  a  British  citizen
    child has at all times a personal right of entry to and  abode  in  the
    United Kingdom.

 8. Ms  Heybroek  argued  that  the  appellant's  child  cannot  reasonably
    exercise that right, if  the  appellant  is  not  admitted,  since  the
    sponsor still cannot show that he has income of �18,600 or compensating
    savings, such that he is entitled to be joined by  the  appellant,  his
    spouse and the child's mother.

 9. The circumstances are unfortunate, but Ms Heybroek has been  unable  to
    identify any authority for the proposition that on  a  bare  Article  8
    case it is possible to allow an appeal for the purpose of upgrading the
    family life between the parties rather than simply respecting it.

10. On that basis, and not without sympathy for the position in which  this
    family finds itself, there is no statutory or jurisprudential basis  on
    which this appeal can be allowed and I dismiss it.

Decision


11. For the foregoing reasons, I remake the  decision  in  this  appeal  by
    dismissing it.
