Representation:
For the Appellant:          Ms R Popal (counsel instructed by Barnes
Harrild and Dyer)
For the Respondent:       Mr Melvin & Ms Cunha (Senior Home Office
Presenting Officers)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of RAA, a citizen of Iran  born  4  October  2001,
       against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge O'Malley) of 7
       December 2018 to dismiss  his  appeal,  itself  brought  against  the
       Respondent's decision of 29 May 2018 to refuse his application to  be
       recognised as a refugee.


    2. RAA arrived in the UK on 9 May 2017 in the back of a lorry.  Although
       his asylum application was  refused,  he  was  granted  Discretionary
       Leave to Remain on the basis of being an unaccompanied minor until  4
       April 2019.

    3. RAA's asylum claim was that he faced discrimination for being a  Kurd
       and a Sunni Muslim, and the prospect  of  serious  harm  due  to  his
       father's actions. His father worked as a prison guard. One evening in
       late February 2017 his father came home and told RAA and the rest  of
       the family that they  would  have  to  flee  the  country;  a  fuller
       explanation would be given once they were on their way.  His  parents
       packed up clothes and food for the  journey,  and  left  the  country
       together.

    4. Once in Greece, his mother told the Appellant  that  his  father  had
       been paid by a prisoner's relatives to arrange his release.  However,
       his father failed to secure the prisoner's  release,  notwithstanding
       having spent the money. His father was then threatened  with  serious
       consequences if he failed to either fulfil his side of the bargain or
       return the money. He travelled to the  UK  via  Turkey,  Greece,  and
       countries  unknown,  having  been  separated  from  his  family  when
       entering the lorry. In  the  course  of  his  account  the  Appellant
       referred to having an uncle and aunt remaining in Iran, in  Sardasht;
       social media searches had failed to re-establish  contact  with  them
       since he left the country.

    5. Supporting evidence included  a  number  of  reports  from  Professor
       Joffe. One report of 30 September 2012  stated  that  Kurdish  failed
       asylum seekers faced "an enhanced threat of being considered a priori
       to have defamed the Islamic Republic while abroad ... Previously  the
       Iranian authorities required positive evidence of offences that would
       be considered specifically political in nature  ...  Now  that  is  a
       basic assumption which an accused person will have  to  disprove,  so
       that the burden of proof has shifted significantly against an  asylum
       seeker who has been  returned  ...  returned  Kurds  face  particular
       scrutiny and thus  the  danger  of  further  accusations  being  laid
       against them." A further report of 2 March 2016 referred to  tensions
       running  high  through  Iranian  Kurdistan,  ensuring  that  official
       attitudes remained hostile  and  repressive,  and  that  any  Kurdish
       returnee  would  have  to  anticipate  serious   risk   of   official
       discrimination  if  not  persecution,  and  that  they   would   face
       "particular scrutiny"  given  that  Kurdish  protests  were  savagely
       repressed due to fears of external interference and Kurdish  activism
       over the  ISIS  threat;  the  Iranian  government  disproportionately
       targeted minority groups; legislation was employed against the  Kurds
       for exercising their rights to  freedom  of  expression;  Kurds  were
       frequently  and  disproportionately  punished  for  the   "catch-all"
       offences  of  "crimes  against  God";  and  the  execution  rate  had
       accelerated.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that it was not appropriate to make
       any credibility findings adverse to the Appellant,  bearing  in  mind
       the limited role he could reasonably be assumed to have  had  in  the
       decisions behind his family's flight from Iran and his journey to the
       UK. It accepted that his father was a prison guard, and  the  country
       evidence that bribery of such guards was widespread. It was plausible
       that the Appellant's father would have taken a bribe, given this  was
       a regular aspect of detention in Iran. However, no guarantee could be
       given that the  bribe  would  secure  the  release  of  its  intended
       beneficiaries, and it was inconsistent that a family with  the  reach
       and influence to seriously threaten the Appellant's family would rely
       on a payment to a prison guard who was discriminated against and held
       back from promotion (this being a matter of which RAA had  heard  his
       father complain).

    7. The Judge decided that Professor Joffe's reports  were  to  be  given
       limited weight, being generic in nature,  and  the  opinions  therein
       were not to be preferred to the  conclusions  in  Country  Guidelines
       decisions.

    8. The Tribunal went on to find that

      a) Whilst being Kurdish gave a Convention ground of membership of a
         particular social group, the Appellant would not face persecution
         on that basis, given that his father's lack of career advancement
         did not represent serious harm such as reach the persecution
         threshold and as there was no evidence of persecution of family
         members, and the Appellant's father's behaviour would not be
         considered to be out of the ordinary in the context of the
         expectations on prison officers;


      b) The Appellant was to be presumed to have left Iran illegally,
         given he would not have had a document to secure his lawful exit:
         the Judge was not satisfied that he did not have a passport when
         he left Iran, but accepted he lacked one by the time he reached
         the UK; the Appellant would not be at risk of serious harm for
         this reason, citing SSH and HR: "An Iranian male in respect of
         whom no adverse interest has previously been manifested by the
         Iranian State does not face a real risk of persecution/breach of
         his Article 3 rights on return to Iran on account of having left
         Iran illegally and/or being a failed asylum seeker. No such risk
         exists at the time of questioning on return to Iran nor after the
         facts (i.e. of illegal exit and being a failed asylum seeker) have
         been established. In particular, there is not a real risk of
         prosecution leading to imprisonment."


      c) The Appellant would not be at risk as a failed asylum seeker as
         his family were not suggested as being politically active, and he
         would have family to whom he could return in order to avoid him
         facing destitution.

    9. Grounds of appeal alleged the First-tier Tribunal had  erred  in  law
       because


      a) There was no valid reason to afford the report of George Joffe
         limited weight and it was unfair to do so, no challenge having
         been made to their contents by the Respondent, without giving
         notice of the possibility - accordingly the First-tier Tribunal
         had wrongly discounted the risks to Kurds, the growing concerns
         about Kurdish activism, the general targeting of minority groups
         and the continued tension in the area, and wrongly treated the
         risks faced by the Appellant to be governed only by SSH and HR
         without regard to HB (Iran);


      b) It wrongly treated SSH and HR as being Country Guidelines vis-ï¿½-
         vis the risks faced by returnees of Kurdish ethnicity when the
         Upper Tribunal had expressly confirmed the contrary in HB (Iran);


      c) It made speculative findings without an evidential basis:

          - As where it concluded that the payment of a bribe could not
            guarantee a prisoner's release, thereby inferring that this
            would be self-evident to anyone seeking to procure such a
            result who would therefore have no reasonable animus to cause
            them to pursue the Appellant's father;


          - In failing to take account of the possibility that the reason
            why the family had not suffered serious harm whilst in Iran was
            the speed of their flight from the country, and

          - In determining that the Appellant would have relatives to which
            to return in Iran without identifying any such extended family.




   10. Permission to appeal was granted on 8 January 2019 on the basis of no
       valid reasons being given for discounting the weight to  be  afforded
       the expert reports.


   11. A Rule 24 response submitted  that  the  reports  of  Dr  Joffe  were
       justifiably rejected, because they were generic in nature, dated from
       2012-2015, not related to this Appellant, not properly disclosable in
       these proceedings, failed to explain via  independent  evidence  that
       the opinions expressed therein had been judicially accepted, and  did
       not explain the basis upon which the report might justify depart from
       the previously extant Country Guidelines.

   12. Before me, Ms  Popal  submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
       overlooked material evidence and made conclusions  now  shown  to  be
       untenable in the light of HB (Iran). Mr Melvin submitted that it  was
       not tenable that all Kurds were at risk; this appeal  had  no  merit,
       and that was effectively recognised by the manner in which  the  case
       had been argued today, whose underlying case theory  sought  to  rely
       upon that very proposition. The new Country Guidelines decision could
       not undermine a First-tier Tribunal decision which pre-dated it.


  Decision and reasons - Error of law hearing

   13. The Country Guidelines regime is described in the Practice Directions
       of the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First tier Tribunal and
       the Upper Tribunal:


           "12.2 ... [a] country guidance  case  is  authoritative  in  any
           subsequent appeal, so far as that appeal:
           (a) relates to the country guidance issue in question; and
           (b) depends upon the same or similar evidence. ...
           12.4 Because of the principle that like cases should be  treated
           in like manner,  any  failure  to  follow  a  clear,  apparently
           applicable country guidance case or to  show  why  it  does  not
           apply to the case in  question  is  likely  to  be  regarded  as
           grounds for appeal on a point of law."


   14.  The  proper  approach  to  Country  Guidelines  decisions  has  been
       litigated  over  time.   The   following   propositions   have   been
       established.


      a) Stanley Burnton LJ in SG (Iraq) [2012] EWCA  Civ  940  ï¿½47  stated
         that "decision makers and tribunal judges  are  required  to  take
         Country Guidance determinations into account, and to  follow  them
         unless very strong  grounds  supported  by  cogent  evidence,  are
         adduced justifying their not doing so";


      b) Simon LJ  in ST (Afghanistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 2382  observed  that
         the headnote to a Country Guidelines decision showed  the  content
         that was  of  general  applicability  -  the  relevance  of  other
         findings will depend on the  particular  facts  of  the  case  and
         whether the issue depends on similar evidence;


      c) In PR (Sri Lanka) [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1946,  McCombe  LJ  cautioned
         against reliance on isolated passages of  evidence  in  a  Country
         Guidelines decision that had been cited for completeness and which
         appeared to play no part in the final decision;

      d) Wilson LJ (as he then was) at ï¿½24-25 of RK (Algeria)  [2007]  EWCA
         Civ 868 essentially held that the Tribunal remained seized of  the
         case until such time as the determination was  promulgated  on  16
         July 2014:

           "24. [counsel submitted that if] there is in the course of delay
           in the Tribunal's preparing or promulgating a decision a
           substantial change for the better in the relevant circumstances
           which obtain in the foreign country, it is highly undesirable
           that no cognisance can be taken of itI ... [Ravichandran] held
           that judicial determinations made within the immigration
           appellate structure were to be regarded as an extension of the
           decision-making process and so in principle should be based upon
           circumstances as they are at the time of those determinations
           rather than at any earlier stage. ...
           25. There has to come a time, however, at which the opportunity
           for judicial survey of up-to-date evidence stops. Under our
           system, and save in exceptional circumstances, it stops upon
           promulgation of the Tribunal's determination; and so it has
           stopped by the time when the case reaches this court."

      e) Flaux LJ in NA (Libya) [2017] EWCA Civ 143 [2018]  EWCA  Civ  2382
         concluded that as a general rule, the fact that a determination of
         the First Tier Tribunal is inconsistent with a Country  Guidelines
         case issued after its promulgation will not amount to an error  of
         law. However this analysis  would  not  apply  where  the  Country
         Guidelines decision has been promulgated before that of the  lower
         Tribunal.


   15. It can accordingly be seen that there was no material  error  of  law
       caused by the First-tier Tribunal failing  to  take  account  of  the
       decision  in  HB  (Iran):  the  Country   Guidelines   decision   was
       promulgated on 12 December 2018 whereas  the  decision  appealed  was
       promulgated on 7 December 2018. Accordingly the principle  identified
       in NA (Libya) governed the case: the Country Guidelines decision post-
       dated the First-tier Tribunal's decision, and  was  thus  not  to  be
       treated as governing similar factual issues.


   16. Nevertheless, it seemed to me that there were material errors of  law
       in the decision below. The issues  raised  in  the  country  evidence
       before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  required  careful  scrutiny.  That
       evidence included number of reports  by  Professor  Joffe,  which  Mr
       Popal informed me (and I have no reason to  doubt)  were  before  the
       Upper Tribunal in HB (Iran). It is clear that  the  opinion  evidence
       therein  demanded  close  attention.  As  HB  (Iran)  post-dated  the
       promulgation of the decision now appealed,  the  conclusions  of  the
       Tribunal there are not strictly  relevant  to  the  Upper  Tribunal's
       function in this appeal when identifying whether a material "error of
       law" has been committed.

   17. However, the fact that the HB (Iran) Tribunal clearly  accepted  that
       material of this nature was  relevant  to  its  conclusion  that  the
       situation for returning Kurds had worsened demonstrated  the  general
       force of the material. I accept that the First-tier Tribunal may well
       come to a different conclusion on the risk faced by the Appellant had
       it had regard to these reports rather than simply ruling them out  of
       account. I did not consider that the Secretary of State's  objections
       to reliance  on  these  reports  were  made  out.  Professor  Joffe's
       opinions have often been given weight  in  immigration  appeals;  his
       expertise speaks for itself. It was unnecessary for  the  reports  to
       justify the extent to which they  invited  departure  from  the  pre-
       existing Country Guidelines, because  there  were  no  such  relevant
       Guidelines.


   18. The First-tier Tribunal clearly considered that SSH and  HR  provided
       Country Guidelines for Kurds returning to Iran. However, that was not
       the case. This should have  been  clear  from  the  decision  itself,
       without the need for the point to be made in HB (Iran). However,  the
       new Country Guidelines decision makes the point clear  (via  language
       strongly indicating that this was self-evident from the text  of  SSH
       and HR itself) ï¿½98(1): "For the avoidance of doubt, that decision  is
       not authority for any proposition in relation to the risk  on  return
       for refused  Kurdish  asylum-seekers  on  account  of  their  Kurdish
       ethnicity alone."

   19. Accordingly observations on the country evidence on the risks  facing
       Kurdish returnees in SSH and HR fell to be treated in line  with  the
       reasoning in PR (Sri Lanka and ST (Afghanistan):  ie  as  potentially
       relevant material, but certainly not as  a  procrustean  bed  against
       which the Appellant's claim was to be exclusively measured.

   20. The crux of the Appellant's claim  was  that,  whether  or  not  some
       adverse action might be taken against his family  by  those  who  had
       bribed his father, he would face a  disproportionate  reaction  on  a
       return to Iran as a Kurd whose  father  had  taken  a  bribe  from  a
       powerful family in order to secure the  release  of  a  prisoner.  If
       questioned by the authorities on a  return,  the  Appellant's  father
       might well have to explain the fact that he had received a bribe  and
       chosen not to action it; that decision might  have  consequences  for
       his family members,  depending  on  the  authorities'  reaction.  The
       proposition that this would simply be discounted by  the  authorities
       without further investigation or punishment as run-of-the-mill prison
       officer behaviour seemed  highly  unlikely.  It  was  here  that  the
       evidence from  Professor  Joffe  referring  to  an  increase  in  the
       suspicions of officialdom in relation  to  Kurds  generally  demanded
       express treatment. HB (Iran) was to subsequently summarise the  Upper
       Tribunal's own conclusions, driven partly by his opinion evidence, as
       being that the authorities showed a "hair trigger" attitude in  their
       attitude to Kurdish returnees.

   21. I accordingly considered that there was a material error  of  law  in
       the decision appealed. As the remaining issues were of limited scope,
       it was appropriate to retain the appeal in  the  Upper  Tribunal.  No
       error of law having been alleged or identified in the  acceptance  of
       the Appellant's credibility,  those  findings  would  stand  for  the
       continuation hearing. However the appropriate inferences to be  drawn
       from those findings must be re-determined.

   22. In my error of law decision, I indicated that the Country  Guidelines
       in HB (Iran) would be relevant to the final decision on this  appeal,
       albeit that some of the opinion evidence of Professor Joffe on  which
       reliance was placed below  was  not  accepted  as  made  out  to  the
       relevant standard of  proof,  for  example  his  opinion  that  Kurds
       effectively faced a reverse burden of proof, and his suggestion  that
       all returning Kurds might face a real risk of persecution.

   23.  At  the  continuation  hearing,  the  parties  agreed  that  it  was
       appropriate  for  the  appeal  to  be  determined  on  the  basis  of
       submissions only, no factual issue remaining in dispute.

   24. Ms Popal submitted that the core  facts  were  that  the  Appellant's
       father had conducted himself in a way that  the  Iranian  authorities
       might well see as having made a stand against the country itself, and
       in consequence the Appellant had exited Iran illegally.  The  Iranian
       regime might well act in a way that would seem perverse  to  decision
       makers in a democracy, but that was nevertheless a real  possibility.
       The Country Guidelines showed that the consequences of  the  sins  of
       the parents might well be visited on their children, and this  was  a
       risk that had to be combined with  that  of  being  a  failed  asylum
       seeker, and with the evidence  that  the  authorities  took  a  "hair
       trigger" approach.  The Appellant had limited  family  ties  left  in
       Iran,  as  there  was  no  evidence  that  he  had  successfully  re-
       established contact with his uncle and aunt in Iran, and he had  lost
       contact with his father and mother in Greece, which was not untypical
       of events  during  the  flight  of  asylum  seekers  across  national
       borders. The very fact the Secretary of State had granted  him  leave
       to remain as a minor showed that it was established that  there  were
       no relatives remaining in Iran who would be available to care for him
       in  the  future.  Iimputed  political  opinion  was  central  to  the
       Appellant's claim, and the opinions attributed  to  Kurds  were  very
       broad, see  eg  HB  (8)  capturing  "social  welfare  and  charitable
       activities on behalf of Kurds."

   25. Ms Cunha submitted the grant of  leave  was  founded  on  section  55
       Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009  duties,  which  had  a
       protective  basis  and  should  not  carry  over  into   the   asylum
       determination process. It remained the case that he had relatives  in
       Iran who were shopkeepers which suggested that there were no  dangers
       to his father's relatives  generally  there.  Whilst  Iranian  prison
       conditions would pose a  real  risk  of  Article  3  violations,  the
       evidence  did  not  establish  the  Appellant  would  actually   face
       imprisonment on return. HB could be distinguished: the  illegal  exit
       of a minor per se would not cause problems on a return,  and  HB  was
       the son of KDPI political  activists  who  had  been  killed  by  the
       Iranian authorities, whereas here the father's activities were wholly
       apolitical, and there had been no  UK  political  activities,  so  it
       could not be said that the regime's approach to political  dissidence
       would carry over to his particular circumstances

   26. This appeal raises the relatively short point as to whether  the  son
       of a Kurdish prison  guard  who  grossly  failed  in  his  duties  by
       accepting bribes to secure a prisoner's release would be at risk from
       the authorities. I join with the First-tier Tribunal  in  ruling  out
       any real risk from the family whose bribe had failed to  procure  the
       intended result: they would be  non-state  actors  and  there  is  no
       evidence that they would have any reach across the territory of  Iran
       generally or even within the Kurdish areas.  However,  the  potential
       risk faced from the authorities is a rather different matter.

   27. The conclusions in HB (Iran) concentrate on the increasing  suspicion
       that attaches to Kurdish political activities  of  any  scale  rather
       than  on  the  possibility  that  a  person's   actions,   themselves
       ostensibly  politically  neutral,   may   attract   punishment   (for
       themselves or their family members) that is aggravated by racially or
       politically  motivated  considerations.  Nevertheless,  the   Country
       Guidance clearly has some value by analogy.

   28. The Upper Tribunal in HB  (Kurds)  Iran  CG  [2018]  UKUT  430  (IAC)
       concluded

       "(1)   SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016]
          UKUT 308 (IAC)  remains valid country guidance in terms of the
          country guidance offered in the headnote. For the avoidance of
          doubt, that decision is not authority for any proposition in
          relation to the risk on return for refused Kurdish asylum-seekers
          on account of their Kurdish ethnicity alone.
       (2)  Kurds in Iran face discrimination. However, the evidence does
          not support a contention that such discrimination is, in general,
          at such a level as to amount to persecution or Article 3 ill-
          treatment.
       (3)   Since 2016 the Iranian authorities have become increasingly
          suspicious of, and sensitive to, Kurdish political activity. Those
          of Kurdish ethnicity are thus regarded with even greater suspicion
          than hitherto and are reasonably likely to be subjected to
          heightened scrutiny on return to Iran.
       (4)   However, the mere fact of being a returnee of Kurdish ethnicity
          with or without a valid passport, and even if combined with
          illegal exit, does not create a risk of persecution or Article 3
          ill-treatment.
       (5)   Kurdish ethnicity is nevertheless a risk factor which, when
          combined with other factors, may create a real risk of persecution
          or Article 3 ill-treatment. Being a risk factor it means that
          Kurdish ethnicity is a factor of particular significance when
          assessing risk. Those "other factors" will include the matters
          identified in paragraphs (6)-(9) below.
       (6)   A period of residence in the KRI by a Kurdish returnee is
          reasonably likely to result in additional questioning by the
          authorities on return. However, this is a factor that will be
          highly fact-specific and the degree of interest that such
          residence will excite will depend, non-exhaustively, on matters
          such as the length of residence in the KRI, what the person
          concerned was doing there and why they left.
       (7)   Kurds involved in Kurdish political groups or activity are at
          risk of arrest, prolonged detention and physical abuse by the
          Iranian authorities. Even Kurds expressing peaceful dissent or who
          speak out about Kurdish rights also face a real risk of
          persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.
       (8)   Activities that can be perceived to be political by the Iranian
          authorities include social welfare and charitable activities on
          behalf of Kurds. Indeed, involvement with any organised activity
          on behalf of or in support of Kurds can be perceived as political
          and thus involve a risk of adverse attention by the Iranian
          authorities with the consequent risk of persecution or Article 3
          ill-treatment.
       (9)   Even 'low-level' political activity, or activity that is
          perceived to be political, such as, by way of example only, mere
          possession of leaflets espousing or supporting Kurdish rights, if
          discovered, involves the same risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-
          treatment. Each case however, depends on its own facts and an
          assessment will need to be made as to the nature of the material
          possessed and how it would be likely to be viewed by the Iranian
          authorities in the context of the foregoing guidance.
          (10)   The Iranian authorities demonstrate what could be described
          as a 'hair-trigger' approach to those suspected of or perceived to
          be involved in Kurdish political activities or support for Kurdish
          rights. By 'hair-trigger' it means that the threshold for
          suspicion is low and the reaction of the authorities is reasonably
          likely to be extreme."

   29. The Upper Tribunal also found, in HB ï¿½93: "In  relation  to  a  child
       whose parents disappeared  more  than  20  years  ago,  it  is  quite
       possible that a child would be regarded as equally dangerous  as  the
       parents.  It might be assumed that he would be hostile  towards  them
       for that reason alone.  The crucial thing is the male line."


   30. The Secretary of State has published a Country Policy and Information
       Note  Iran: Illegal exit (Version 5.0 February 2019) which states:

           "6.1.4 The 2018 DFAT report stated:  'According to Article 34 of
           the Penal Code, the penalty for leaving the country without a
           valid passport (or similar travel document) is between one and
           three years' imprisonment, or a fine of between 100,000 and
           500,000 rials (AUD4-20). A special court located in Tehran's
           Mehrabad Airport deals with [cases of people leaving the country
           without a valid passport or similar travel document] ... The
           court assesses the background of the individual, the date of
           their departure from the country, the reason for their illegal
           departure, their connection with any organisations or groups,
           and any other circumstances. This procedure also applies to
           people who are deported back to Iran and who are not in
           possession of a passport containing an exit visa. DFAT
           understands that illegal departure is often prosecuted in
           conjunction with other unrelated offences."

   31. Another relevant  document  from  the  Home  Office  is  the  Country
       Information  and  Guidance   Iran:  Prison  conditions  (Version  1.0
       February  2016):

           "2.4 Are prison conditions so poor  that prisoners are at real
           risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.


           2.4.1 Prison conditions in Iran are harsh and often life-
           threatening with severe overcrowding, poor ventilation, extreme
           temperatures, poor sanitary conditions including a lack of
           access to clean drinking water and a lack of sufficient toilet
           facilities. There is a serious lack of access to the appropriate
           medical care. In a number of cases sick prisoners have been
           denied adequate medical care, including medication.  Food at
           some prisons has a low nutrional value and they have been
           reports of many detainees being malnourished.  Authorities mixed
           violent and nonviolent offender populations. Political prisoners
           in some prisons are subject to forced labour.  2.4.2 Torture and
           mistreatment are also common within prisons in Iran.  Whilst
           officials claim that no one is subjected to torture  detained
           prisoners often report forced confessions, prolonged solitary
           confinement, rape, physical and psychological  torture and mock
           executions. There were reports of systematic rape of women
           prisoners as well as coerced virginity testing of female
           prisoners.
           2.4.3 The government does not permit independent monitoring of
           prison conditions and sometimes prisoners were subjected to
           threats after they lodged complaints with the authorities. The
           Iranian authorities have frequently failed to conduct
           independent investigations into allegations of torture and other
           ill-treatment by officials, which has contributed to a pervasive
           culture of impunity.
           2.4.4 Prison conditions in Iran are, in individual cases, likely
           to create a real risk of torture and/or inhuman or degrading
           treatment or punishment.
           2.4.5 Decision makers must consider each case on its facts. For
           the factors to be considered and further information, see
           Section 3.4 of the Asylum Instruction on Humanitarian
           Protection."

   32. Professor Joffe has repeatedly stated that "the  Iranian  authorities
       assume that all asylum seekers who are returned to Iran have  engaged
       in anti-regime activities  whilst  abroad,  especially  in  spreading
       false information about the Islamic republic"  (eg  ï¿½119  of  October
       2014 report).


   33. Drawing the themes together from this evidence, it seems to  me  that
       there is a real risk that the Appellant would face serious harm on  a
       return to Iran. He cannot be expected to lie on return, and is likely
       to have to justify his departure, given that it was presumably via an
       illegal exit. So it must be assumed  that  he  will  give  a  similar
       account to the Iranian authorities as to the Home Office here. It  is
       not difficult to envisage that a  repressive  regime  which  takes  a
       "hair trigger" attitude to Kurdish returnees will  look  unkindly  on
       the actions of a prison guard who took a bribe to release someone who
       was necessarily of interest to the authorities. As the Tribunal  once
       stated in Suleyman (16242; 11 February 1998):

           "It is clear to us that a repressive regime ... may well act  in
           ways which defy logical analysis. A person who  is  genuinely  a
           victim of such a regime may well find that the  partial  account
           he is able to give of its activities as they have  affected  him
           is not something which will  stand  up  to  a  strictly  logical
           analysis. The regime may seem to govern  by  confusion;  it  may
           engage  in  other  activities,  of  which  the  Appellant  knows
           nothing; it may simply behave in a way which a person sitting in
           safety in the United  Kingdom  might  regard  as  almost  beyond
           belief'."

   34. In the light of the evidence that  almost  any  conduct  can  attract
       adverse attention from the Iranian authorities, I  also  accept  that
       there is a real chance that their reaction would be  motivated  by  a
       political opinion being attributed to the Appellant's father.  It  is
       clear that any conduct capable of being seen as anti-regime may  lead
       to political suspicions.


   35. The more significant concern is whether the Appellant  himself  would
       be at risk. Absent any evidence either way,  I  would  probably  have
       inferred that he was not at risk; it  would  be  surprising,  in  the
       normal course of events, for a country's  authorities  to  visit  the
       consequences of a parent's behaviour on a child who was not otherwise
       associated with their activities. However, given the possibility that
       a  Kurdish  political  activist's  child  could  be  persecuted   for
       political reasons solely down to  a  parent's  actions  twenty  years
       after the relevant political activity, it seems to me that there is a
       real risk that a similar animus would be visited on the  child  of  a
       delinquent Kurdish prison guard a relatively  short  time  after  the
       original offence took place.

          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law and is set aside.
    The appeal is allowed.


    ANONYMITY ORDER


    Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  Appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify her or any member of her  family.   This  direction
    applies both to the Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
