For the Appellant:     Mr West, Counsel instructed by FR Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of India born on the  30th  May  1969.   He
    claims to have been living continuously in the United Kingdom since his
    arrival in January 1993.  The  burden  of  proof  to  prove  that  long
    residence is on the  Appellant,  and  it  must  be  discharged  on  the
    standard of 'a balance of probabilities'. If he can prove  that  matter
    of fact, it is common ground that he will be granted leave to remain on
    human rights grounds,  pursuant  to  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iii)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 2. The Respondent accepts, having had regard to the  documentary  evidence
    provided, that the Appellant has been  living  in  this  country  since
    2005/2006. It is not accepted that the Appellant was here  any  earlier
    than that.



    Case History

 3. This matter first came before me on the  12th  March  2021.  It  was  a
    remote hearing conducted by way of 'skype for business'. I was  sitting
    at Manchester Civil Justice Centre; the Appellant was represented by Mr
    West, as he is today, and the Respondent by Senior  Presenting  Officer
    Mr Bates.

 4. The appeal before me concerned the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge GA Black). Judge Black had dismissed the Appellant's  appeal  on
    the 19th February 2020. Permission to appeal against that decision  was
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly  on  the  21st  April  2021.
    Judge Kelly had considered it arguable that Judge Black  had  erred  in
    her approach to the evidence, and to the  test,  still  then  relevant,
    under 276ADE(1)(vi).

 5. My written decision of the 12th March 2021 is headed 'Decision on Error
    of Law and Directions'. In material part it reads as follows:

        "The First-tier Tribunal began by  noting  that  this  was  not  the
        Appellant's first appeal. An earlier human rights application,  made
        on grounds of long  residence,  had  been  rejected  and  an  appeal
        dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal in 2016 on the grounds that the
        documentary evidence only established the Appellant to have been  in
        the United Kingdom from about 2005. There was insufficient  evidence
        before the Tribunal on that occasion to support a  finding  that  he
        had been living here since 1993 as he claims.  That decision was the
        Tribunal's starting point. From there the Tribunal was  required  to
        evaluate the new evidence. This comprised the oral evidence  of  the
        Appellant plus four witnesses: the  Tribunal  directed  itself  that
        there was no further documentary evidence  produced,  in  particular
        nothing to show that the Appellant had been living in  this  country
        between 1993 and 2004.  The case therefore turned on the  Tribunal's
        evaluation of the witnesses.  The Tribunal concluded that  the  oral
        evidence given, by both Appellant and his witnesses, was unreliable,
        inconsistent and vague. It was not capable of discharging the burden
        of  proof  and  the  appeal  was   dismissed   with   reference   to
        276ADE(1)(iii) of the Immigration Rules.

        On the alternative limb of the  Appellant's  case,  that  concerning
        276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules, the Tribunal directed itself that it was
        for the Appellant to demonstrate  that  there  were  "insurmountable
        obstacles" to his integration in India. Having regard  to  the  fact
        that the Appellant grew up in that country,  is  familiar  with  the
        language and religious customs,  retains  familial  connections  and
        could receive medical care there, the  Tribunal  was  not  satisfied
        that this test was met, and the appeal was further  dismissed  under
        276ADE(1)(iii).

        The  written  grounds  of  appeal  challenge  both  aspects  of  the
        decision.




        Issue 1: 20 years' long residence

        As I allude  to  above,  the  key  question  here  was  whether  the
        Appellant had demonstrated  in  this  fresh  claim  that  there  was
        evidence to show that he was living in this country prior to 2005/6.
        In order to do this he relied primarily on the evidence of his  four
        witnesses, all of whom averred to have known  him  in  this  country
        prior to 2005. He did however also provide two items of  documentary
        evidence in support of his claim. The Appellant's bundle contained a
        letter dated 5th February 2010 from a firm based in  Banbury  called
        'Plastic Parts Direct Ltd (APM)'. This states that the Appellant was
        employed there between the 5th June 1995 and the  30th  April  2000.
        There was further a letter from the Guru  Nanak  Medical  Centre  in
        Southall stating that the Appellant had been registered as a patient
        there since 1995.  Before me the Secretary of State accepts that the
        First-tier Tribunal has erred in its approach  to  that  documentary
        evidence.

        As to the GP letter, the Tribunal simply  notes  that  it  had  been
        available before the previous Tribunal which had  "found  that  this
        alone was insufficient to show 20 years  continuous  residence"  [at
        �9]. The First-tier Tribunal then dealt with the  employer's  letter
        at its �10:

        "The appellant has been unable to provide documentary evidence  from
        HMRC to support his claim that he has worked in United Kingdom since
        1993. The HMRC evidence starts from  2006.  I  accept  that  he  has
        worked unlawfully but there is no evidence of employment from  1993.
        There is a copy of a letter dated 5.2.2010  from  APM  which  states
        that he was employed from 5.6.95 -  30.4.2000  but  I  place  little
        weight on this letter in the absence  of  supporting  evidence.  The
        documentary evidence establishes that the appellant has been in  the
        United Kingdom since 2006".

        Mr Bates accepts that two errors in approach arise here.  The  first
        is that having acknowledged  that  it  would  be  difficult  for  an
        illegal migrant to corroborate the claimed employment with reference
        to HMRC records, the Tribunal goes on attach "little weight" to  the
        letter itself without explaining why.  I accept that this  error  is
        made out. It would have been unarguably  open  to  the  Tribunal  to
        attach some  weight  to  this  document  but  nevertheless  find  it
        insufficient to discharge the burden of proof, but  the  formulation
        "little weight" suggests that the Tribunal  found  the  document  in
        some way to be intrinsically lacking in probative value. If that was
        the case, no reasons are given to explain why.   Secondly,  in  this
        credibility assessment the Tribunal was obliged, even in this  human
        rights claim, to take a Tanveer Ahmed approach to the  evidence.  It
        was required to weigh all of the evidence together.   Mr  Bates  did
        not consider it evident that this is  what  the  Tribunal  did,  and
        given the approach to the GP letter, I  would  have  to  agree.  The
        fact that a previous Tribunal had found  that  letter  alone  to  be
        insufficient did not obviate the need to weigh it  in  the  balance,
        with the remaining evidence,  in the present appeal.

        Mr Bates accepted that absent a holistic  Tanveer  Ahmed  assessment
        the entire credibility assessment of whether the Appellant lived  in
        this country prior to 2005 would need to be remade, and  this  would
        require a fresh evaluation of the witnesses.   It is  not  therefore
        necessary for me to address the  discrete  grounds  challenging  the
        approach taken to the oral evidence.   The decision  insofar  as  it
        relates to 276ADE(1)(iii) is set aside in its entirety and falls  to
        be remade.




        Issue 2: very significant obstacles to integration

        If the Appellant failed to demonstrate that he has  been  living  in
        the United Kingdom for a continuous period of 20 years  it  remained
        open to him to argue that he should nevertheless be granted leave on
        private life grounds under paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi).  This  requires
        him to show that there would be "very significant" obstacles to  his
        integration in India. At its  �17  the  Tribunal  twice  misdirected
        itself  that  he  had  to  demonstrate  "insurmountable"  obstacles.
        Before me Mr West very sensibly conceded that this  error  was  not,
        having regard to  the  Tribunal's  reasoning  overall,  in  any  way
        material. The findings were such that the Appellant could  not  hope
        to meet either of these very demanding tests,  which  in  any  event
        have been found to overlap in light of the  definition  set  out  in
        paragraph EX.2 of Appendix FM."

 6. I directed that the matter come back before me so  that  the  decision,
    insofar as it related to paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, could be remade.




    The Re-Made Decision

 7. The matter was listed for an all day, face to face, hearing because  at
    the stage that I gave my listing directions, I was under the impression
    that the Appellant would be calling four additional witnesses.   As  it
    happened,  on  the  day,  only  one  additional  witness  appeared,  Mr
    Dharmveer Singh Aujla.  His evidence, and that of  the  Appellant,  are
    summarised below.

 8. The Appellant and Mr Aujla were late to court. They were not  ready  to
    proceed until 12.00, despite the fact that the hearing had been due  to
    start at 10.00.  The Appellant explained to me that he had attended his
    solicitor's office in Hounslow this morning thinking that he  would  be
    giving evidence 'remotely'. He thought that because that is what he had
    been told by the solicitor.  I  noted  that  the  'notice  of  hearing'
    clearly stated that the hearing would be  at  Field  House.  I  further
    noted however, that the Tribunal had not  served  that  notice  on  the
    Appellant himself, only on the solicitors: the same solicitor  who  had
    allegedly told the Appellant that it would be by remote means.



    The Evidence

 9. The Appellant produced a large bundle of documents. Witness  statements
    were provided from five witnesses who were  not  in  attendance.  These
    were all signed and appended with  copies  of  the  deponent's  British
    passport. Each individual attested to having known  the  Appellant  for
    various lengths of time. Mr Avtar Singh Jhamat states that he has known
    the Appellant since 1995; Prem Singh Sandhu has known him  since  1993;
    Satinder Pal Singh since 1995; Parveen Kumar Dahiya some 17  years  and
    Dharamjit Singh  since  2004.  There  were  in  addition  a  series  of
    documents said to emanate from villagers in the Appellant's  home  area
    in the Punjab. The import of this evidence was that both of his parents
    have now passed away and that the family homestead has, in the  absence
    of any family, been taken over by other locals.

10. For the purposes of this decision  I  need  not  set  out  any  of  the
    documentary evidence relating to the period since  approximately  2005,
    since it has been accepted, at least since the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Richards-Clarke on  the  5th  February  2016,  that  the
    Appellant has lived continuously in the UK since that time.

11. The documentary evidence relating to the period prior to that is, as Mr
    West acknowledged, scant. The following material is advanced as capable
    of demonstrating residence in the UK prior to 2005:

               . A letter dated 13th December 2015 from Harjit  Singh,  Vice
                 President of the Gurdwara Sri Guru  Singh  Sabha  Southall,
                 stating that the Appellant has been personally known to him
                 for 16 years and that he volunteers at the Gurdwara

               . A letter dated 14th May 2019 from Virendra  Sharma  MP  for
                 Southall, stating that he has known the Appellant for "some
                 years". He writes "Mr Singh has been living in the UK since
                 1993, as I understand it and within my  constituency  since
                 2000"

               . A letter dated 1st February 2010 from a Dr Gulbash Singh of
                 the the Guru Nanak Medical Centre in Southall stating  that
                 the Appellant  has  been  registered  there  as  a  private
                 patient since 1995

               . A letter from 'Plastic Parts Direct Ltd' stating  that  the
                 Appellant was employed there as a 'general assistant'  from
                 the 5th June 1995 until the 30th April  2000  and  that  he
                 resigned from his job due to "personal reasons  and  family
                 circumstances"

12. The Appellant gave oral evidence  with  the  assistance  of  a  Punjabi
    interpreter. He averred that he entered the UK by  lorry  in  1993.  In
    response to Mr West's questions the Appellant said that when  he  first
    arrived he had lived with a friend Harjit, but after some  time  Harjit
    said that he didn't have room and so he took him to another house where
    a family were living. The Appellant rented a room  there.  The  son  of
    that family, then young at the time, was the  witness  Dharmveer  Singh
    Aujla.   The Appellant thinks he lived in that house between  1995  and
    2000.   He spent his time visiting the Gurdwara,  going  to  a  pub  in
    Southall called the 'Glassy Junction' and visiting his  friends  Harjit
    and Amardeep.

13. Mr Clarke put it to the Appellant that there was a  divergence  between
    his evidence, and that given in writing by Dharmveer Singh  Aujla.  The
    Appellant had just told the  Tribunal  that  he  lived  in  Mr  Aujla's
    household; Mr Aujla seemed to think  he  was  a  regular  visitor.  The
    Appellant said that Mr Aujla was very young at the  time,  and  as  the
    Appellant was coming and  going  maybe  he  had  not  understood.   The
    Appellant still visits that house, but he maintains that  he  did  live
    there. Mr Clarke put it to the Appellant that he  and  Mr  Aujla  could
    have concocted this story about them  living  together.  The  Appellant
    denied this.   The Appellant maintained that he had stayed at the Aujla
    family house in Uxbridge Road over a number of years.

14. Mr Clarke asked  the  Appellant  why  apart  from  Mr  Aujla,  none  of
    witnesses whose statements appear in the bundle, had attended court. He
    said one is in India, two could not come because  of  Covid.   They  do
    support his claim, they just couldn't come.

15. The Appellant was asked about the letter in the bundle from Mr Virendra
    Sharma  MP.  The  Appellant  confirmed  that  he  has  met  Mr   Sharma
    personally. The first time he met him was during  the  Vaisakhi  spring
    festival procession in Southall in 1994. His friend  Harjit  introduced
    them. He visited him at his office a couple of times after that and has
    also met him at the Gurdwara.  Mr Clarke put it to the  Appellant  that
    there was an apparent discrepancy on the face of the letter  since  the
    MP had written that the Appellant had been a resident of Southall since
    2000, whereas it was the Appellant's evidence that he had lived in  the
    area the whole time. The Appellant was unable to comment  on  that;  he
    reiterated that he had met the MP in a line of people serving  food  at
    the Gurdwara.

16. The Appellant said that when he first arrived he did ad hoc work for an
    builder. After that, from 1995, he worked  at  a  plastics  factory  in
    Banbury.   Then he got a job fitting windows.   He  also  worked  in  a
    shop.

17. Mr Clarke's cross-examination then proceeded to probe  the  Appellant's
    allegations about his previous solicitors, Malik Law Ltd.  The  sum  of
    these allegations is that Maliks did not manage his  case  competently,
    and that they asked witnesses to sign statements which were inaccurate.
       Mr Clarke took the Appellant to the witness statement signed  by  Mr
    Satinder Pal Singh: Mr Singh makes an allegation that  even  though  he
    has known the Appellant personally for 22 years, Mr Malik told  him  to
    say in a statement that it was no more than  11  years.  The  Appellant
    agreed that this was a serious allegation but  maintained  that  Maliks
    did not handle his case properly. He did however accept that he has not
    made a complaint against the  firm,  for  instance  to  the  Solicitors
    Regulatory Authority. He said it was because he was 'illegal', that  no
    one was guarding him,  and  he  was  unaware  that  such  a  thing  was
    possible. Mr Clarke suggested that perhaps  it  was  more  likely  that
    Satinder Pal Singh had changed his evidence  to  suit  the  Appellant's
    claim.   The Appellant simply said that Malik Law had  not  dealt  with
    the case properly.

18. Mr Clarke asked the Appellant about his evidence that he used  a  false
    National Insurance number over a number of years. He had written in his
    statement in 2019 that if he had "been given more time" he  could  have
    sought confirmation from HMRC that this other number had been used.  Mr
    Clarke asked why that evidence had not yet  been  produced,  given  the
    time that had  passed  since  the  statement  (over  two  years).   The
    Appellant said that he had called HMRC last year  but  they  said  that
    they do not have the records.  Mr Clarke queried why the Appellant  had
    not written to the HMRC. He explained that it was because they had told
    him over the phone that they did not have the records. He  agreed  that
    the solicitors should perhaps have written.  He  denied  inventing  the
    phone call. He said that a friend had  made  the  call  on  his  behalf
    because his English is weak. It was the friend who is  at  court  -  Mr
    Aujla.

19. A key part of the Appellant's case is the letter said to  be  from  the
    Appellant's previous employer. It is headed 'Plastic Parts Direct Ltd -
    Advanced Plastic Mouldings'. It states that the Appellant worked  there
    from 5th June 1995 to the 30th April 2000. The letter bears the address
    Unit 8 Overfield, Thorpe Way Industrial Estate.  Mr Clarke produced two
    documents which he submitted seriously  undermine  the  reliability  of
    that document.  The first is a  print  out  from  the  Companies  House
    record.  This  shows  that  'Plastic  Parts  Direct  Limited'  was  not
    incorporated  until  the  7th  August  2003;  it  gives  the  company's
    registered address as 10 Manor Park, Banbury.  The  record  shows  that
    APM was incorporated as  a  company  on  the  31st  October  1997;  its
    registered address in Kings Cross, London.    Mr Clarke put it  to  the
    Appellant that none of that information accords with  what  it  on  the
    letter he has produced. Mr Clarke further relied upon the terms of  the
    Company Limited Liability Partnership and Business (Names  and  Trading
    Disclosures) Regulations 2015 which make it a legal requirement  for  a
    company's registered address to appear on its stationary. The Appellant
    said that he cannot assist; all he can say is that he worked  there.  A
    friend had got him that job,  and  subsequently  got  him  that  letter
    confirming that he had worked there.  That friend is now in Canada.   I
    asked the Appellant to clarify what work he had done at the factory. He
    said that he had worked  in  the  packing  department.  He  packed  the
    plastic  components  into  boxes.  There  were  three  others  in   the
    department "like  him".  When  I  asked  him  what  he  meant  he  said
    "illegals". They were always paid in cash.

20. Mr Clarke asked  the  Appellant  to  explain  why  three  letters  from
    officials at the  Gurdwara  Sri  Duru  Singh  Sabha  in  Southall  gave
    apparently  conflicting  information.  One   of   the   temple's   Vice
    Presidents, a Mr Sohan Singh Sumra, wrote to say that the Appellant had
    been a regular worshipper there since 2008 and that  he  volunteers  in
    the langar (the kitchen distributing free food in accordance with  Sikh
    custom). A different Vice President, Mr Harjit Singh, wrote in 2015  to
    say that he had personally known the Appellant "for the last 16 years":
    this would place him at the Gurdwara in 1999.    The  Appellant  simply
    said that Mr Singh knew him much better than Mr Sumra.

21. The Appellant was asked about when he had first met Mr Jhamat,  someone
    who had written a statement and who had employed the Appellant  over  a
    number of years as a window fitter. The Appellant said that he had  met
    him in 1995. Mr Clarke put it to him that his  written  statement  says
    that it was 2002.  The Appellant explained that Mr  Jhamat's  statement
    had originally been drafted wrongly by the solicitor and  that  it  had
    subsequently been amended. They had met in the Gurdwara in  1995.    He
    had started working for him part time in 2004 and  after  a  couple  of
    years went full time. He worked fitting windows until 2017.  Mr  Clarke
    put it to the Appellant that according to a  letter  from  Mr  Jhamat's
    company 'Sunrise Glazing', the Appellant had been employed there  since
    2002.    The Appellant said that  the  "girls  must  have  changed  the
    dates", by which I understood him to mean the administrative  staff  at
    Sunrise Glazing.

22. The Appellant was asked about two letters he had produced from the Guru
    Nanak Medical Centre in Southall.   They are both purportedly  from  Dr
    Gulbash Singh. The first is dated 1st February 2010, and the second the
    7th March 2018. Mr Clarke put it to the Appellant that  the  signatures
    on the two letters were completely different.  The  Appellant  said  he
    could not explain that, he had  simply  asked  for  a  letter  and  had
    collected it from the reception.

23. In answer to my questions  at  the  close  of  his  oral  evidence  the
    Appellant confirmed that he had travelled into the UK in the back of  a
    lorry. He had sold the family  land,  which  he  had  farmed  prior  to
    leaving India, and had given it to an agent  who  had  facilitated  his
    journey. He said that having landed at Dover he was taken  and  dropped
    at Uxbridge Station where a friend  who  lived  in  Southall  came  and
    picked him up - this is the Harjit that he had referred to  earlier  in
    his evidence. Harjit is back in India now.     The Appellant said  that
    he had supported his parents thereafter by sending them what he  could.
    His mother died in 2014 and his father died in 2016.

24. The second witness was Mr Aujla. He adopted his written statements.  He
    confirmed that he believes that he met the  Appellant  in  about  1995,
    when he was around five years old: Mr Aujla was born in 1990.   He said
    that the Appellant had lived in his house. He remembers  the  Appellant
    taking him to school, shopping and to the park. He called him  "chacha"
    which means uncle, and  can  remember  the  Appellant  and  his  father
    sitting together in the lounge talking with other friends. This was  at
    his family home in Uxbridge Road. The Appellant slept  in  the  bedroom
    that Mr Aujla now occupies today.  Mr West asked Mr  Aujla  to  explain
    why he had not mentioned this in his witness statement, where he simply
    says that the Appellant was a regular visitor to the  family  home.  Mr
    Aujla said that sometimes the Appellant would come and go, depending on
    where he was working.   He agreed that it would have been more accurate
    to say that the Appellant stayed at the house rather than living  there
    - he did not, as far as  Mr  Aujla  could  recall,  keep  his  personal
    possessions there.  Mr Aujla was unable to comment on how the Appellant
    first came to know his family, as he was too young at the time.

25. The bundle contained a  series  of  photocopied  photographs  depicting
    family groups together in various locations.  Mr Aujla had  the  colour
    originals  with  him  and  they  were  shown  to  me.  There  were  ten
    photographs in total and Mr Aujla was given two coloured pens. He  drew
    pink circles around the individual in the pictures that  he  identified
    as the Appellant, and blue circles  around  pictures  of  himself.  The
    photos were said by Mr Aujla to depict the following:

              i) Images 1 and 9 show a family group of adults  and  children
                 outside the family home in Uxbridge Road. The Appellant  is
                 in the photograph, as is Mr Aujla. He estimated that he was
                 about 8 or 9  at  the  time,  which  would  mean  that  the
                 photograph was taken in 1998 or  1999.  He  pointed  out  a
                 young child who appears in the pictures whom he  identified
                 as is younger brother, who is seven years younger than him;

             ii) Image 2 shows three men and two  children  sitting  in  the
                 lounge of the house in Uxbridge Road. One of the men is the
                 Appellant, the other Mr Aujla's father  and  the  third  an
                 unknown 'uncle' with a little  girl.  Mr  Aujla  identifies
                 himself in the picture and estimates that he was about 6 or
                 7, which would mean that the image was  taken  in  1996  or
                 1997;

            iii) Images 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were all taken at a beach, which
                 Mr Aujla thought would be either  Brighton  or  Bournemouth
                 because that's where his family  always  went.  After  some
                 discussion (the beach is sandy  as  opposed  to  rocky  and
                 there are coloured beach huts in the background) he  agreed
                 it was Bournemouth. The Appellant is shown, along  with  Mr
                 Aujla and his family. Mr Aujla noted that  he  was  "a  bit
                 more chubby" at that stage and he thinks that this was when
                 he was about 10 or 11,  which  would  place  that  trip  in
                 approximately 2000 or 2001;

             iv) The final image shows the Appellant with two children on  a
                 sofa. Mr Aujla considered  that  he  looks  older  in  this
                 image: he thinks he was again about 10  or  11.  The  other
                 child is his younger brother,  who  would  then  have  been
                 about 3 or 4.

26. In cross examination Mr Clarke put it to Mr Aujla that we had no  means
    of knowing whether the individuals depicted in the photographs were  in
    fact him and the Appellant. Mr Aujla laughed and said that all he could
    say was that he knew it was him.




    Submissions

27. Mr Clarke asked me to find that the Appellant had failed  to  discharge
    the burden of proof upon him. The evidence relating to  the  period  in
    issue - technically July 2001 - 2005 but more broadly from 1993 on,  is
    scant and what there is can properly be found to be unreliable.  As the
    documentary evidence, the Secretary of State  pointed  out  that  there
    were deficiencies in each item.  The  letters  from  the  GP  were  not
    reliable as the signatures on  each,  both  ostensibly  from  the  same
    doctor,  were  patently  different.  The  letter  from   the   plastics
    manufacturer was wholly unreliable  as  it  bore  no  relation  to  the
    records for either of the companies mentioned held at Companies  House;
    furthermore the Appellant's evidence on how it  was  obtained  was  not
    credible.  The letter from the MP added little given that  the  MP  was
    vague as to when he had first met the Appellant, it was likely that  it
    was written by surgery staff relying upon information provided  by  the
    Appellant himself and as he had pointed out in his evidence,  MPs  meet
    hundreds of people all the time so Mr Sharma could not be  expected  to
    recall when he had met the Appellant.  The  various  letters  from  the
    Gurdwara were odd and raised yet more questions  given  that  different
    Vice Presidents apparently  thought  that  the  Appellant  had  started
    attending there at different times.  As to the oral evidence Mr  Clarke
    asked me to find the Appellant's evidence unhelpful  and  evasive.  His
    account of the telephone call to HMRC was not at all credible. He asked
    me to find  that  given  the  difference  between  Mr  Aujla's  written
    evidence - that his 'Chacha' was a regular visitor - and  the  evidence
    advanced orally that he  had  actually  lived  in  the  house,  it  was
    evidence that I could place only  a  little  weight  upon.  Finally  Mr
    Clarke asked me to place no, or little, weight on the photographs since
    it was not possible for me to say with any degree of certainty that the
    child shown was in fact Mr Aujla, or how old he was at  the  time  that
    the picture was taken.   Even if I was minded to accept that the  child
    was in fact Mr Aujla, the photographs were not in themselves sufficient
    to discharge the burden of proof given the difficulties with  the  rest
    of the evidence.

28. Mr West acknowledged that there were weaknesses in the  way  that  this
    case had been prepared. The GP letters were not  supported  by  the  GP
    notes  which  could  have  demonstrated  that  the  Appellant's   first
    consultation was in 1995.  The evidence of a number  of  witnesses  was
    only in writing, and untested as it was, he agreed  that  there  was  a
    limit  to  the  weight  that  it  could  be  given.  Mr  West   further
    acknowledged that the letter from the plastics manufacturer did not, on
    its face, appear to  comply  with  the  various  laws  and  regulations
    referred to by Mr Clarke. He however urged me to find that taken in the
    round, all of this evidence was capable of discharging  the  burden  of
    proof.  The photographs were powerful evidence that the  Appellant  had
    been in this country when Mr Aujla was a young  child,  and  given  the
    uncontested evidence that Mr Aujla was born in 1990, this was  strongly
    probative of his presence here in the relevant period.




    Findings and Reasons

29.  The  Appellant's  evidence  was  unsatisfactory  in   many   respects.
    Confronted by the various discrepancies  and  weaknesses  in  his  case
    during Mr Clarke's expert cross examination he repeatedly  resorted  to
    blaming others, most often his solicitors: Malik Law Ltd had not  acted
    competently, to the extent that they had included blatant  untruths  in
    witness statements that they had prepared; his current  solicitors  had
    failed to give him the correct information about the  hearing  and  had
    not "guided" him about what evidence he  should  produce.   "Girls"  in
    offices  and  doctor's  receptionists  appeared  in   the   frame   for
    inconsistencies in the documents.  The Appellant gave evidence which on
    its face made little sense.  He claimed, for instance, that the  letter
    from the plastics factory had been obtained by a friend because he,  as
    "an illegal", could not have asked them for a letter, and yet  this  is
    exactly what they gave him.  I have borne all of that in mind.

30. Mr Clarke was quite right to point to the deficiencies in some  of  the
    documents. I attach no weight to the letter from Mr Sharma MP, since  I
    agree that these letters are invariably produced on the basis  of  what
    the MP - or more accurately the MPs staff member - has been told.   The
    letter from the plastics manufacturer is extremely  problematic.  Apart
    from the issues identified by Mr Clarke, I would further  question  why
    the company would have kept a very specific record of the dates that an
    undocumented migrant, paid illegally  by  them  in  cash,  was  working
    there. The reference to him having left due to  "family  circumstances"
    makes little sense given that he has no family here.  I  am  minded  to
    accept Mr Clarke's submission that this letter is unreliable.  It  may,
    for instance, have  been  produced  by  the  Appellant's  friend  in  a
    misguided attempt to assist him in his appeal.

31. I am not however prepared to disregard all of the documents before  me.
    The letters from the GP are written on headed notepaper, with the  full
    contact details for the  practice.  Both  letters  bear  a  stamp,  and
    contain information that it is hard to imagine the Appellant being able
    to fabricate. The fact that the signatures on the letters are different
    is not, in my view, fatal to my assessment of  its  veracity:  one  can
    well imagine a busy GP practice having letters in the  out  tray  being
    signed by whoever is dealing with the post that day. The letter clearly
    states that the Appellant's first consultation there was in  1995,  and
    that is matter which attracts some weight.   Then there are  the  three
    letters from Mr Harjit Singh  of  the  Gurdwara  in  Southall.  He  has
    written these over a number of years to confirm that he has  personally
    known the Appellant since  1999.  I  do  not  agree  with  Mr  Clarke's
    submission that this was markedly inconsistent with the evidence of the
    Gurdwara's other Vice President, who placed him as a regular worshipper
    only since 2008. It is perfectly possible that Harjit  Singh  knew  the
    Appellant in another capacity - personally, as he says. Furthermore  it
    is also conceivable that in a busy temple different officials  come  to
    know different worshippers at different  times;  we  do  not  know  for
    instance when Mr Sumra even took office. I place  some  weight  on  the
    fact that Harjit Singh, an elected official of this place  of  worship,
    has been prepared to write repeatedly in the terms that he has.  I have
    attached some weight,  albeit  minimal,  to  the  various  letters  and
    statements that appear in writing, although untested, in the bundle.

32. As Mr West identified, the most significant  evidence  is  that  of  Mr
    Aujla.  It was not impressive that Mr Aujla and the Appellant attempted
    to inflate the evidence by  suggesting  in  their  testimony  that  the
    Appellant had lived in  that  house.  This  appeared  to  have  been  a
    deliberate exaggeration, designed to make it seem that they were closer
    that than they actually were. When the difference between his oral  and
    written evidence was put to him, Mr Aujla  reversed  his  position  and
    agreed that in fact the Appellant had only stayed  there  as  a  guest.
    That said, I do believe the core of Mr Aujla's evidence.  He  gave  his
    testimony in  a  natural  manner  with  a  good  level  of  detail.  He
    explained, for instance, that the room that the Appellant stayed in  is
    the bedroom he lives in today.   Importantly,  his  evidence  attracted
    powerful corroboration  in  the  form  of  the  photographs  that  were
    appended to his witness statement, and produced in original form at the
    hearing. I was  left  in  no  doubt  that  the  individual  shown,  and
    identified by Mr Aujla as the Appellant,  is  in  fact  the  Appellant.
    Although he appears much younger in the pictures, it is quite evidently
    him: I  did  not  understand  Mr  Clarke  to  argue  otherwise  in  his
    submissions. Mr Clarke did however submit that it was not possible  for
    me to say that the child shown was Mr Aujla. I disagree. Mr Aujla  has,
    he will I hope forgive me for saying so, a distinctive face.  In all of
    the images apart from number 2, where the child  in  question  is  much
    younger, I am confident in accepting that this is indeed Mr  Aujla,  as
    he claimed.  It looks like him, and he immediately, unhesitatingly  and
    credibly identified it as himself.  I  find  no  reason  to  doubt  his
    evidence on the matter: there is an obvious difference in an individual
    identifying himself  as  9  or  10  year  old  from,  for  instance,  a
    photograph of a baby. Mr Aujla was in no doubt that these were pictures
    of himself, other family members and the Appellant.

33. The First-tier Tribunal has determined, in 2016, that the Appellant has
    been living continuously in  the  UK  since  2005/2006.  The  remaining
    matter for me to decide, in this human rights appeal, is whether as  of
    today's date he has in fact been living here continuously from the 14th
    July 2001, such as to satisfy the terms of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii)  of
    the Rules. On the evidence before me I am satisfied that the  Appellant
    has discharged the burden of proof. Although I able to  attach  only  a
    little weight to the written statements of friends  and  acquaintances,
    and to some of the documentary evidence, I have  been  able  to  attach
    significant weight to  the  credible  evidence  of  Mr  Aujla  and  his
    photographs. I accept  that  these  depict  the  Appellant  in  various
    locations in the UK along with Mr Aujla at a time when the latter was a
    young boy of no more than 10-11 years old. Since Mr Aujla was  born  in
    1990 it follows that the photographs are  logically  probative  of  the
    claim that the Appellant was here in 2000-2001.  I weigh  that  in  the
    balance with the GP letter and the evidence from the Vice-President  of
    the Gurdwara.  Having done so I find that on a balance of probabilities
    the Appellant has lived continuously in the UK for at least  20  years.
    It follows that the appeal must be allowed.





    Decisions

34. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss the appeal on  human
    rights grounds is set aside.

35. I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing  the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds.

36. There is no order for anonymity.
