                                  DECISION

   1) Following consideration of the Respondent's letter  dated  24  January
      2019 in which it is conceded  that  the  preserved  findings  of  fact
      together with the application of SSH  and  HR  (illegal  exit:  failed
      asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 308 and HB (Kurds) Iran  CG  [2018]
      UKUT 00430 (IAC) are  such  that  the  appellant's  appeal  should  be
      allowed on asylum grounds, I gave directions indicating  my  intention
      to remake the appeal by allowing it on asylum grounds, subject to  any
      objection by either party before 4 February 2019.

   2) Having not received any objection to my proposed course, I remake  the
      decision by allowing the appeal on asylum grounds.
