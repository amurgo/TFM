                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, a citizen of Ghana born on 28th  November  1984  appeals
    with permission against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  panel
    (Judge S Taylor and  Mr  F  T  Jamieson  JP)  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 27th June 2013 dismissed his appeal against the decision
    of the Respondent to make a deportation order against him under Section
    32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.

The Background

 2. The history of the appeal is as follows.  The Appellant claims that  he
    entered the UK in 1999 using a Ghanaian passport which was not his, and
    remained in the UK illegally since that time.  It was  further  claimed
    that since his arrival he had stayed with an uncle  until  he  died  in
    2003/2005 and had not attended any schools or colleges.  He first  came
    to the attention of the immigration authorities at  HMP  Winchester  on
    3rd May 2012.

 3. The Appellant has a criminal record during the time of his residence in
    the United Kingdom.  On 18th March 2008, at Thames  Magistrates  Court,
    the Appellant was convicted  of  failing  to  provide  a  specimen  for
    analysis and was fined �250 and disqualified from driving for  eighteen
    months.  On 16th March 2011 at North West Hampshire Magistrates  Court,
    the Appellant was convicted of two  counts  of  battery  for  which  he
    received a community order on 12th April 2011.  On 22nd March 2012,  at
    North West Hampshire Magistrates Court, the Appellant was convicted  of
    possession of a class A drug, crack cocaine with intent to  supply  and
    also possession of heroin with intent to supply  and  possession  of  a
    class B drug namely cannabis/cannabis  resin.   He  was  committed  for
    sentence at  Winchester  Crown  Court  and  on  20th  April  2012,  the
    community order was revoked  and  he  was  sentenced  to  a  period  of
    imprisonment of sixteen months.  The details of  the  offence  and  the
    role played by the Appellant are set out  in  the  sentencing  remarks.
    The trial judge noted the  very  serious  nature  of  the  offences  of
    possession with intent to supply class A drugs namely crack cocaine and
    heroin.  He had been found with nineteen wraps of class A drugs, valued
    at between �300 and �400, whilst the judge accepted that the  Appellant
    became involved at the behest of others and of playing a  lesser  role,
    and giving credit for his early guilty  plea  it  was  noted  that  the
    Appellant  was  dealing  in  drugs  and  that  a  prison  sentence  was
    inevitable.  The Appellant was also in  breach  of  a  community  order
    which was revoked.  It appears from the criminal papers that there  was
    a charge relating to a prohibited  weapon.   The  Appellant  gave  oral
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that he pleaded guilty  to  the
    offence of possession of a prohibited weapon  which  was  a  taser  gun
    which he had in the house but he had claimed that he did  not  know  it
    was a prohibited weapon.  He had kept that in the house which he shared
    with his partner and children.

 4. On 18th May 2012 the Appellant was served with notice of liability  for
    deportation and representations on his behalf were made stating that he
    came within one of the exceptions on the grounds  of  his  private  and
    family life in the  United  Kingdom.   The  Respondent  reviewed  those
    representations and concluded that the Appellant did  not  fall  within
    any of exemptions from automatic deportation.  On 28th November 2012  a
    decision was made that  Section  32(5)  of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007
    applied.  The Respondent gave reasons for  the  decision  in  a  letter
    dated 28th November 2012.  The Appellant appealed against that decision
    and his appeal was heard  on  12th  June  2013  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, by a panel consisting of First-tier Tribunal Judge Taylor and
    Mr F T Jamieson JP.

Appeal before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal panel,  they  heard  oral
    evidence from the Appellant and his partner  Miss  Tyzack.   The  panel
    also considered a number of documents that had  been  produced  on  the
    Appellant's behalf.  In a determination promulgated on 27th  June  2013
    the panel dismissed the appeal against the  Respondent's  decision  and
    did not find that the Appellant  came  within  one  of  the  exceptions
    listed in Section 33 of the 2007 Act.  They reached the conclusion from
    the evidence in respect of his immigration history that he had  entered
    the UK illegally and made no attempt to make an application  for  leave
    to remain or to regularise his status in the UK  until  served  with  a
    deportation order.  They further found that contrary to  his  evidence,
    he had not entered the UK in 1999 but had only been  resident  for  the
    last three and a half years since 2010.  As to  his  family  life  with
    Miss Tyzack they rejected  the  evidence  that  they  had  been  living
    together for the period that they had maintained but  found  that  they
    had been in a relationship since the latter part of 2010 but that  they
    had not lived together until January  2012.   It  was  noted  that  the
    Appellant had a son with Miss Tyzack namely  Dwayne  who  was  born  in
    November 2011 but found that the Appellant had spent little time living
    with Dwayne and Miss Tyzack noting that Dwayne was 4 months old at  the
    time of his arrest and the Appellant had only spent three  months  with
    him since release from prison.  In respect  of  Hayden,  Miss  Tyzack's
    son, the panel found that the Appellant was not his natural father  nor
    did he have any  statutory  or  other  responsibility  for  him.   They
    rejected evidence that he would be distressed by  the  absence  of  the
    Appellant noting that the Appellant had lived with Hayden at most three
    to four months prior to his arrest and for a  short  period  since  his
    release.  As to the circumstances in which the relationship was  formed
    it was found that  the  Appellant  had  entered  illegally,  had  never
    applied for leave or sought to regularise  his  status  and  that  Miss
    Tyzack knew of this when entering into  the  relationship.   The  panel
    considered that the offences for which the Appellant had been convicted
    were serious offences as they involved the  supply  and  possession  of
    class A drugs which they found to  be  "a  danger  to  society".   They
    reached  the  conclusion  that  the  Appellant  could  not   meet   the
    Immigration Rules, indeed it had not been suggested that the  Appellant
    could and that after balancing all the factors reached  the  conclusion
    that the public interest outweighed  any  argument  the  Appellant  had
    raised by way of private or family life.

 The Proceedings before the Upper Tribunal

 6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought on behalf of  the
    Appellant and on 25th July 2013 permission to  appeal  was  refused  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Sommerville.  The same grounds were  reissued
    and an application was made to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Storey granted permission on 23rd August 2013.  The reasons given
    were as follows:-

         "But for what I say in the next paragraph I  would  have  concurred
         with  Judge  Sommerville  in  considering  that  in   the   overall
         assessment of proportionality the fact that the panel proceeded  on
         the incorrect basis that the Appellant was at a medium rather  than
         low risk of reoffending did not materially affect  the  outcome  of
         the appeal.

         Whether or not the panel  failed  to  address  the  relevant  legal
         issues to be decided in the correct order, it  is  plain  that  the
         Appellant could not succeed under the new Immigration Rules and the
         panel was quite entitled to find that paragraph 399  had  not  been
         met because the Appellant had failed to show there were exceptional
         circumstances.   However,  leaving  aside  the  extremely  confused
         nature of the grounds (the grounds at 3 totally  misread  what  was
         found by MF (Nigeria) in respect of the new  Rules),  it  does  not
         appear to me that the panel considered the Appellant's  case  under
         Article 8 outside the new Rules.  That is entirely contrary to  MF,
         Izuazu and other reported cases.  The panel did have regard to  the
         best interests of the child (see paragraphs 22 and 25) but  whether
         it did so in the context of Article 8 outside  the  Rules  is  very
         doubtful."

Appeal Hearing and Submissions:

 7. Thus the appeal came before the Tribunal  on  21st  October  2013.   Mr
    Akindele provided a skeleton argument upon which  he  placed  reliance.
    There are three grounds that were advanced on behalf of  the  Appellant
    by Mr Akindele.  Firstly, that the panel did not consider the Article 8
    claim of the Appellant under the  ECHR  standard  as  set  out  in  the
    decision of MF (Nigeria) and Izuazu, secondly that the  best  interests
    of the children  concerned  were  not  considered  in  accordance  with
    general Article 8 principles and thirdly that  the  panel  had  made  a
    mistake of fact when it noted that the Appellant had been found  to  be
    at a medium risk of reoffending and posing a medium risk of  harm  when
    the documentation referred to the Appellant presenting a  low  risk  of
    reoffending.

 8. In respect of the first ground he submitted that the panel  had  failed
    to follow the guidance in MF (Nigeria) and had failed to employ a  two-
    stage approach to the consideration  of  Article  8  namely  that  they
    should have considered whether the Immigration Rules were satisfied and
    if they were not to then consider the Article 8 claim  outside  of  the
    Rules under the ECHR  as  prescribed  by  the  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in MF (Nigeria).  Mr Akindele conceded that since the  grounds
    were submitted that that case had come before the Court of  Appeal  and
    had been reported at MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.  However
    Mr  Akindele  submitted  that  the  panel  had   not   considered   the
    proportionality factors properly in respect of this Appellant's case in
    that the Appellant was clearly able to demonstrate  that  there  was  a
    reasonable difficulty in the Appellant's family relocating to Ghana and
    the panel did not consider whether the breakup  of  the  family  was  a
    proportional one or not.  In  this  respect  at  paragraph  24  of  the
    decision, they applied  the  wrong  test  when  they  stated  that  the
    circumstances of Miss Tyzack were not exceptional.  The panel also  had
    failed to take into account or had any regard to  the  fact  that  both
    children were British citizens as was  Miss  Tyzack  and  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect them  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  with  the
    Appellant.  As Hayden was not the natural father of the  Appellant  and
    his natural father lived in the United Kingdom it was not reasonable to
    expect him to leave the UK either.  Thus it was  an  error  of  law  to
    state that that was an option open  to  the  Appellant's  partner.   He
    submitted  that  the  appropriate   question   was   whether   it   was
    proportionate to break  up  the  family  and  that  if  the  panel  had
    considered that question the appeal would have been  allowed  and  that
    there was no public interest in the breakup of this family.

 9. As to the second ground, he submitted that the panel did  not  consider
    the best interests of either Hayden or Dwayne his natural child and  it
    was incumbent upon the panel to determine the  best  interests  of  the
    children  and  weigh  that  against  the  public  interest  which  they
    identified in the case.  Nothing was said about the best  interests  of
    the children.

10. As to the third ground, the panel stated that it had  been  noted  that
    the pre-sentence report concluded that he  was  at  a  medium  risk  of
    causing serious harm and a medium risk of reoffending.  They went on to
    state that the Appellant had said there had been an assessment  of  him
    as a low risk of reoffending but the  panel  stated  that  he  had  not
    submitted a written report of this assessment.  The evidence at page 19
    (First-tier Tribunal bundle) did  state  that  the  Appellant  posed  a
    medium risk of serious harm to the public and was at a medium  risk  of
    reconviction.  However a later letter on 15th May 2013 at page 8  noted
    that upon release from licence  he  was  assessed  at  a  low  risk  of
    reoffending.  Thus it was a mistake of fact and  was  material  to  the
    outcome. He  submitted  the  determination  should  be  set  aside  and
    reheard.

11. Mr Allen on behalf of the Respondent submitted that the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal panel did not disclose any material error  of  law.
    He submitted that nowhere within the determination did the panel  adopt
    any  test  of  exceptionality  when  considering  the   proportionality
    assessment either  under  the  Rules  or  outside  of  the  Rules.   He
    submitted that the sole basis upon which permission had been granted by
    Judge Storey was  on the ground advanced that the  panel  arguably  did
    not consider the two-stage test. There had been no application to amend
    the grounds for permissions to appeal.  However  since  permission  has
    been granted the Court of Appeal's decision in  MF  (Nigeria)  made  it
    clear at paragraphs 43 to 44 that the new Rules were  a  complete  code
    and  that  the  question  of  proportionality  would  be  decided  when
    considering the new Rules in the same way as it would have  been  under
    the ECHR.  In this case the panel considered all the  relevant  factors
    which were of relevance and they were  addressed  by  the  panel.   The
    panel did consider the best interests of the  children  by  considering
    the relationship between the Appellant and the children and Miss Tyzack
    and found that the family life that he had was outweighed by the public
    interest element in this appeal.  That was a matter that  was  entirely
    open to them to make on the facts of this case.  There was no  need  to
    conduct a separate assessment under the ECHR as they did so within  the
    ambit  of  the  Rules  and  under   paragraph   398   of   "exceptional
    circumstances".

12. The panel's conclusion at paragraph 27  listed  the  factors  and  upon
    doing so noted that they had found no exceptional  circumstances.   The
    balance conducted by the panel demonstrated that they did carry  out  a
    proper weighing of the proportionality factors relevant in this  appeal
    and it has not been demonstrated that any such factors  had  been  left
    out of consideration.  The balance was a matter for the panel.

13. As to the risk of reoffending, it was  submitted  that  it  was  not  a
    mistake of fact.  At paragraph 19 there was a letter  which  the  panel
    relied upon stating that the Appellant posed a medium risk of harm  and
    was at a medium risk of reoffending.  That drew on  evidence  from  the
    presentence report.  Thus it was not a straightforward mistake of fact,
    it was simply a question of weight and whether or not the panel  should
    have given weight to the second letter which said that he was at a  low
    risk of reoffending.  In any event both Upper Tribunal Judge Storey and
    Judge Sommerville did not grant permission on that ground  noting  that
    any error would not have been material.  Looking at  the  determination
    as a whole, it could not be asserted that the First-tier Tribunal panel
    made any material error of law in this respect and that  it  was  plain
    from the determination that the balance was in  favour  of  the  public
    interest  element  of  deportation  irrespective   of   the   risk   of
    reoffending.

14. As to the best interests of the children, there was specific  reference
    to the best interests of the children at paragraph 25 and  that  matter
    was weighed in the balance by the panel also.  The panel noted  Section
    55 and the decision of ZH (Tanzania) thus they expressly considered the
    best interests of the children but having done so  did  not  find  that
    their interests outweighed the other  countervailing  factors  in  this
    case.  Thus he submitted the determination should be upheld.

15. Mr Akindele by way of reply reiterated his submission  that  there  had
    been a mistake of fact which should lead to the determination being set
    aside as a whole.  Secondly, he submitted that the  best  interests  of
    the children deserved more consideration than the panel had given it at
    paragraph 25.

16. At the conclusion I reserved my determination.

My Assessment

17. I commence by setting out the relevant provisions  of  the  Immigration
    Rules relating to deportation and  Article  8,  as  introduced  by  the
    Statement of Changes in HC 194 on 9th July 2012, at paragraphs  396  to
    399B.

    396. Where a person is liable to deportation the presumption  shall  be
           that the public interest requires deportation.   It  is  in  the
           public interest to deport where the Secretary of State must make
           a deportation order in accordance with  Section  32  of  the  UK
           Borders Act 2007.

    397. A deportation order will not  be  made  if  the  person's  removal
           pursuant to the order would be contrary to the UK's  obligations
           under the Refugee Convention or  the  Human  Rights  Convention.
           Where deportation would not be contrary to these obligations, it
           will only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the  public
           interest in deportation is outweighed.

    Deportation and Article 8


    398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary  to
           the UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
           Convention, and

           (a)    the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                the public good because  they  have  been  convicted  of  an
                offence for which they have been sentenced to  a  period  of
                imprisonment of at least 4 years;

           (b)    the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                the public good because  they  have  been  convicted  of  an
                offence for which they have been sentenced to  a  period  of
                imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months; or

           (c)    the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                the public good because, in the view  of  the  Secretary  of
                State, their offending has caused serious harm or they are a
                persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for the
                law,

           the Secretary of State in assessing  that  claim  will  consider
           whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it  does  not,  it
           will only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the  public
           interest in deportation will be outweighed by other factors.

    399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c) applies if -

           (a)     the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                relationship with a child under the age of 18 years  who  is
                in the UK, and

                (i)    the child is a British Citizen; or

                (ii)   the child has lived in the  UK  continuously  for  at
                    least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of  the
                    immigration decision; and in either case

                    (a)    it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                        leave the UK; and

                    (b)    there is no other family member who  is  able  to
                        care for the child in the UK; or

           (b)    the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
                a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled
                in the UK, or in the UK with refugee leave  or  humanitarian
                protection, and

                (i)    the person has lived  in  the  UK  with  valid  leave
                    continuously for  at  least  the  15  years  immediately
                    preceding  the  date   of   the   immigration   decision
                    (discounting any period of imprisonment); and

                (ii)   there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
                    with that partner continuing outside the UK.

    399A.    This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or  (c)  applies
           if -

           (a)    the person has lived continuously in the UK for at  least
                20 years immediately preceding the date of  the  immigration
                decision (discounting any period of imprisonment) and he has
                no ties (including social,  cultural  or  family)  with  the
                country to which he would have to go if  required  to  leave
                the UK; or

           (b)    the person is aged under 25 years, he has spent at  least
                half of his life living continuously in the  UK  immediately
                preceding the date of the immigration decision  (discounting
                any period of imprisonment) and he has  no  ties  (including
                social, cultural or family) with the  country  to  which  he
                would have to go if required to leave the UK.

    399B.    Where paragraph 399 or  399A  applies  limited  leave  may  be
           granted for periods not exceeding 30 months.  Such  leave  shall
           be given subject to such conditions as the  Secretary  of  State
           deems appropriate.  Where  a  person  who  has  previously  been
           granted a period of leave under paragraph 399B  would  not  fall
           for refusal under paragraph 322(1C), indefinite leave to  remain
           may be granted.

18. I have considered the grounds and the submissions made by the  parties.
    In the original grounds advanced on behalf of the Appellant before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and before Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Storey,  it  was
    asserted that the panel did not consider whether the Appellant was able
    to benefit under the Immigration Rules (see paragraph 3 of the  grounds
    as originally drafted) and that the panel failed to carry out Article 8
    analysis "outside the Rules".  The First-tier  Tribunal  observed  that
    the  grounds  seeking  permission  were  "difficult  to  follow"   (see
    paragraph 3) and also correctly observed at paragraph 4 that the  panel
    did consider the Immigration Rules and that in any event,  the  grounds
    did not contend that the appeal should have succeeded under the  Rules.
    Upon renewal of the grounds in the  same  form,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Storey also correctly identified that it was plain that  the  Appellant
    could not succeed under the new Immigration Rules but that  whilst  the
    panel were entitled to find that paragraph 399 had not been met because
    the Appellant had failed to  show  that  there  had  been  "exceptional
    circumstances", the panel did not consider the Appellant's  case  under
    Article 8 "outside the Rules" under the ECHR under a two-stage test  as
    envisaged by the case of MF  (Nigeria).   Both  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and before the Upper Tribunal, the grounds advanced on  behalf
    of the Appellant relating to the mistake of fact was not  found  to  be
    material to the outcome of the appeal.  Thus there was only one  ground
    upon which permission had been granted. No application has been made to
    amend the grounds.

19. Since permission has been granted, the decision  of  MF  (Nigeria)  has
    been the subject of further appeal before the Court of Appeal  and  now
    reported as MF (Nigeria) v  SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192.   Since  the
    grounds were settled, Mr Akindele has now produced a skeleton argument.
     The grounds upon which he seeks to challenge the panel's determination
    are set out at page 7, they are threefold, namely:-

      i) the mistake made in  the  assessment  of  risk  of  reoffending  is
         material  because  it  formed  the  part  of  the  matrix  for  the
         proportionality assessment,

     ii) the Tribunal did not consider the Article 8 claim of the  Appellant
         under the ECHR standards as prescribed by MF (Nigeria),

    iii) that the best interests of the  children  were  not  considered  in
         accordance with the general Article 8 principles.

    However it is plain from the oral submissions and the  content  of  the
    skeleton argument that the grounds now advanced and  the  emphasis  has
    changed from those that have been put before the Tribunal when  seeking
    permission.  They have changed from the ground advanced that the  panel
    did not consider the Article 8 claim of the Appellant  under  the  ECHR
    and that what really is the focus of challenge relates to their  actual
    assessment of the proportionality exercise, whether under the Rules  or
    outside the Rules. There has been no  application  made  to  amend  the
    grounds for permission to appeal. Nonetheless I  have   considered  the
    submissions made by Mr Akindele.

     The decision of the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) demonstrates  that
    the first step undertaken under the new Rules is to decide whether  the
    deportation of the Appellant  would  be  contrary  to  an  individual's
    Article 8 rights on the grounds that (i)  the  Appellant  falls  within
    paragraph 398(b) or (c) and one or more of the conditions  set  out  in
    paragraph 399(a) or (b) or paragraph 399A(a) or (b) applies.   In  this
    appeal the Appellant fell within paragraph 398(b)  as  deportation  was
    deemed conducive to the public good as he was convicted of  an  offence
    for which he was sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  less  than
    four years but at least twelve months.   Thus  the  appeal  had  to  be
    decided under the Rules under paragraphs 399 and 399A.  As observed  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Sommerville, whilst the grounds asserted that
    the panel should have considered the Immigration Rules, it was not  the
    Appellant's case that he could meet the Rules.   Indeed  he  could  not
    meet paragraphs 399 or 399A.  In that event, paragraph 398 applied  and
    that "it will only be in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the  public
    interest in deportation will be outweighed by other factors".

20. At paragraph 14 of the decision of MF (Nigeria)  the  Court  of  Appeal
    made reference to a document entitled "Criminality Guidance For Article
    8 ECHR Cases".  The latest version having been issued in March 2013  to
    assist caseworkers in applying the new Rules.  The document referred to
    what was said about the phrase  "exceptional  circumstances"  where  it
    appears in paragraph 398:-

         "In determining whether a case is exceptional, decision makers must
         consider all relevant factors that  weigh  in  favour  and  against
         deportation.

         'Exceptional' does not mean 'unusual' or 'unique'.  Decision makers
         should be mindful that whilst all cases are to  an  extent  unique,
         those unique factors do not generally render them exceptional.  For
         these purposes,  exceptional  cases  should  be  numerically  rare.
         Furthermore, a case is not exceptional just because the  exceptions
         to deportation in Rule 399 or Rule 399A have been missed by a small
         margin.   Instead,  'exceptional'  means  circumstances  in   which
         deportation would result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for
         the individual or their family such that deportation would  not  be
         proportionate.  That is likely to be the case only very rarely."

21. It is further clear from  the  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  at
    paragraph 39 that the new Rules do not import test  of  exceptionality.
    Nonetheless the decision further makes it clear that the new Rules  are
    a complete code and that the exceptional circumstances to be considered
    in  the   balancing   exercise   involve   the   application   of   the
    proportionality test as required by Strasbourg jurisprudence.  What  is
    required is applying a proportionality test whether under the Rules  or
    outside the Rules; what matters is that it is required  to  be  carried
    out if paragraph 399 or 399A do not apply.  Furthermore, paragraph  398
    expressly  contemplates  weighing  other  factors  against  the  public
    interest and this includes factors relevant  to  proportionality  under
    the ECHR.

22. It is now advanced on behalf of the Appellant that the  panel  did  not
    carry out a proper proportionality  assessment.   To  consider  whether
    they did carry out an assessment of proportionality  either  under  the
    Rules or outside the Rules, it is necessary to consider their  findings
    of fact.  The skeleton argument makes reference to  the  facts  of  the
    appeal at paragraph 15 it is stated: "In  the  appeal  the  close  bond
    between the Appellant and his partner and children are well evidenced --
    -"  However that wholly fails to take into account the findings of fact
    which were made in this appeal from the panel who had the advantage  of
    hearing the  witnesses  give  oral  evidence  concerning  a  number  of
    elements of the Appellant's private and family life.

23. The findings of fact made by the panel can be  summarised  as  follows.
    The  panel  made  the  following  findings  of  fact  relating  to  the
    Appellant's immigration history.  Whilst the Appellant claims  to  have
    entered the United Kingdom aged 15 in 1999 on  a  false  passport,  the
    panel found no record of his entry.  He claimed that he  had  travelled
    to the UK with an unknown person with tickets bought by a person who he
    thought was his father but later found out that it was his  uncle.   It
    is claimed that he lived with him until 2002 until he moved out to live
    with friends in South East London in 2010.  The panel  found  that  the
    Appellant had provided no supporting evidence  that  he  lived  with  a
    relative until 2002 or that he lived in South East  London  until  2010
    (see paragraph 20).  Therefore they made a finding  of  fact  that  the
    Appellant had entered the UK illegally and had made no attempt to  make
    an application for leave to regularise  his  status  in  the  UK  until
    served with a deportation order.  The panel considered evidence of  his
    residence and that of Beatrice Appiah (see paragraph 20).   They  found
    that she provided no evidence of the Appellant's life in the  UK  prior
    to his Crown Court conviction other than to say that he was brought  to
    the UK by his father.  They found that  she  had  no  direct  knowledge
    concerning this matter.  While she said that  he  had  lived  with  her
    father until his death in 2004 the panel observed that the  Appellant's
    evidence was that he had moved out in 2002 and that the uncle had  died
    in 2005.  Consequently the panel found that her evidence  added  little
    to the Appellant's evidence and found it  to  be  contradictory.   Thus
    when reaching a conclusion concerning his immigration history  and  the
    length of time that he had been in the United Kingdom, the panel  found
    no evidence to support the Appellant's claimed presence in the UK prior
    to 2010.  Thus they were not satisfied that he had been resident in the
    UK since 1999 and found that he had been in the UK  for  a  maximum  of
    three and a half years that is since 2010.  It is right  to  note  that
    the panel considered his account of an arrest in 2005 but did not  find
    any evidence in support of that.

24. In respect of his private life (see paragraph 20) when the panel  asked
    him how he had spent his life prior to 2010 he said that he had  had  a
    series of cash-in-hand jobs but that he had not attended any courses or
    took part in any studies in the UK.  The panel found that the Appellant
    had failed to provide an address  at  which  he  was  living  prior  to
    meeting Miss Tyzack and there was no evidence of a previous girlfriend,
    friends or jobs that he claimed had  been  paid  in  cash.   Thus  they
    concluded at paragraph 25 that the Appellant had  shown  no  record  of
    working or studying in the UK, apart from while serving  his  sentence,
    he had provided no evidence of positive engagement to  UK  society  and
    the Tribunal found "no evidence of the establishment  of  a  meaningful
    private life, after having been in the UK for three and a  half  years"
    (see paragraph 25).

25. As to his family life with Miss Tyzack  the  panel  accepted  the  oral
    evidence that the parties had been in a relationship since  the  latter
    part of 2010 but they were not satisfied  that  the  parties  had  been
    living together prior to that and found that they had not  been  living
    together until January  2012.   The  panel  set  out  its  reasons  for
    reaching that finding of fact namely that  neither  the  Appellant  nor
    Miss Tyzack had provided supporting evidence to  show  living  together
    prior to January 2012 (two months prior to his arrest in March 2012 for
    the drugs offences).   The  parties  were  in  a  relationship  at  the
    beginning of 2011 because Dwayne their child was born in November  2011
    and there was evidence to show  them  living  together  as  a  unit  in
    January 2012.  Furthermore in his evidence with regard  to  convictions
    of battery in  March  2011,  the  Appellant  stated  that  he  required
    accommodation for the night and did  not  mention  the  possibility  of
    spending the night with Miss Tyzack and thus that was a further  reason
    for reaching the overall conclusion that whilst  they  had  been  in  a
    relationship since the latter part of 2010 they  had  not  been  living
    together until January 2012, two months before the Appellant went  into
    prison.

26. Miss Tyzack had a child from  a  previous  relationship,  Hayden  Peter
    Tyzack, born on 3rd January 2008.  It was claimed that this  child  was
    treated as the Appellant's biological son and that he had always played
    an active role in Hayden's life.  The findings of the panel are set out
    at paragraph 22.  They found the Appellant not to be his natural father
    and he had no statutory or other responsibility for  him.   They  found
    Hayden's father remained in  contact  with  him  and  Miss  Tyzack  and
    visited on an infrequent basis.  The panel accepted that the  Appellant
    had taken Hayden to school since the end of April 2003 (six weeks prior
    to the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  panel)  but  the  panel
    rejected evidence that Hayden would be distressed by the absence of the
    Appellant.  They found that the Appellant had lived with Hayden at most
    for a period of three to four months prior to his arrest and had  lived
    with him since release in March 2013 for a further  three  months.   As
    they said:-

         "The Appellant is not the father of Hayden and  consider  that  two
         periods of approximately three months, separated by almost a  year,
         would be insufficient to establish a family life  with  Hayden  for
         the purposes of Article 8 of the ECHR".

    With regard to paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules, they found  that
    the Appellant was not the father of Hayden and therefore did not have a
    parental relationship with him, especially as Hayden's  father  remains
    in contact.  The Tribunal was not  satisfied  that  having  lived  with
    Hayden for just three months  after  his  release,  that  there  was  a
    "strong quasi parental relationship had been established".

27. The panel accepted that the Appellant was the natural father of  Dwayne
    born in November 2011.  As to  the  history  of  family  life  and  his
    relationship with Dwayne, the panel found that the  parties  had  lived
    together since January 2012 which was three months prior to his  arrest
    and had also lived together three months since  his  release.   At  the
    time of his arrest, Dwayne was only 4 months of age and  the  Appellant
    had spent only three months with him since  his  release  from  prison.
    The panel noted and took into account at paragraph 24 that for the last
    three months the Appellant had been living at the same address as  Miss
    Tyzack and his son Dwayne but noted the limited time that he  had  been
    able to demonstrate strong and deep family links.

28. As to the circumstances in which the relationship was formed they  were
    set out at paragraph 24.  The panel  found  that  the  set  of  factual
    circumstances were not those to  demonstrate  that  the  Appellant  had
    leave which had expired but noted that he had  entered  illegally,  had
    never applied for leave nor sought to seek  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom on the basis of any family life  until  after  the  deportation
    order and the basis of the family life relied upon had been for a  very
    limited period.  They found that his immigration  status  in  the  host
    state was precarious and that he had entered into a  relationship  with
    Miss Tyzack in the full knowledge that he had  no  leave  and  that  he
    would be liable for deportation or removal.

29. In relation to hardship for the family of the Appellant being separated
    from the children and Miss Tyzack , the panel set out its  findings  at
    paragraph 24.  It had been Miss Tyzack's evidence that  she  could  not
    cope without the Appellant in the UK and had  said  that  she  suffered
    from depression and also other life events that occurred recently.  The
    panel considered that oral evidence and took into  account  the  letter
    that had been produced on behalf of her GP which had reported that  the
    depression that she had was  due  to  several  problems  in  her  life,
    including the recent death of her mother as well as the absence of  the
    Appellant.  The panel did not find that there would be any hardship for
    Miss Tyzack in the absence  of  the  Appellant  in  the  event  of  his
    deportation.  They found that the past history demonstrated  that  Miss
    Tyzack was able to call on the  assistance  of  her  siblings  and  her
    father to a limited extent while the Appellant was in prison  and  that
    she could give no viable reason why she could not  call  on  family  or
    make other arrangements for the care of the children if  she  continued
    to work.  They found "no basis to conclude that  the  circumstances  of
    Miss Tyzack in the absence of the Appellant are exceptional".

30. It is in this context that  it  is  now  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that the panel failed to have regard to  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant's partner and children are British  citizens  and  thus  they
    were not required to leave the United Kingdom and secondly,  the  panel
    failed to have regard to the children's best interests.

31. From a careful reading of the determination, it is plain that the panel
    knew and took into account that the Appellant's partner, and Hayden and
    Dwayne were UK citizens.  There are references to their nationality and
    citizenship at paragraph 9 (where it was noted it was accepted that the
    Appellant was in a relationship with Vicky Tyzack and that she was a UK
    citizen), paragraph 15 in which Miss Tyzack's evidence that she  was  a
    UK citizen was set out again, at paragraph  16  the  evidence  of  Miss
    Tyzack again was clearly stated where it was noted "she had been living
    with the Appellant since 2010.  She would  not  go  to  Ghana,  as  the
    children were UK citizens.  Hayden was in a UK school and she would not
    resettle them in  Ghana".   The  submissions  made  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant were recorded at paragraph 18 where it was stated "it was now
    accepted that no UK citizen should be expected to leave the  UK".   The
    panel in its findings of fact at paragraph 25 were not stating that  it
    was reasonable for the family to relocate to Ghana nor  did  the  panel
    state that she was required to.  The panel merely stated that it was an
    option "open to her", that is an option of choice.

32.   It is further plain from the determination that the  panel  in  their
    findings of  fact  considered  the  effects  upon  the  family  of  the
    separation from the Appellant in the event of his deportation and  that
    is set out at paragraph 24.  The Appellant's partner gave evidence that
    she would find it difficult to cope without the Appellant and that  she
    was suffering from depression.  As set out  in  the  findings  of  fact
    recorded earlier the panel did not accept that evidence and reached the
    conclusion that she had been  able  to  call  upon  the  assistance  of
    siblings and her father to a limited extent whilst he was in prison and
    she gave no "viable reason" why she could not call on  family  or  make
    other arrangements for the care  of  the  children  if  she  wished  to
    continue to work.  Whilst  they  said  that  there  was  "no  basis  to
    conclude that the circumstances of Miss Tyzack in the  absence  of  the
    Appellant are exceptional", the panel were  not  importing  a  test  of
    exceptionality by saying that the circumstances  were  not  exceptional
    but were entitled to find that there would not be  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences using the words set out at paragraph 14 of  MF  (Nigeria).
    This was particularly so in the light and against the background of the
    findings made by the panel considering the short-lived  nature  of  the
    family life that the Appellant and Miss Tyzack and the children had  in
    the UK and what they  considered  to  be  the  limited  nature  of  the
    Appellant's family life.  Those findings in my judgment  reinforce  the
    view that the panel were not saying that Miss Tyzack and  the  children
    should relocate to Ghana but had considered the effect upon the  family
    of the separation and that was an issue in the  proportionality  issues
    that the panel considered.

33.  Contrary to the assertions in the grounds, the  panel  did  take  into
    account the best interests of both children.  The findings of fact made
    are of relevance in this  respect.   As  set  out  earlier  as  regards
    Hayden, the panel found that he was not his natural father and had  had
    no statutory duty or other responsibility for him, his  natural  father
    remained in contact with him and Miss Tyzack, that  the  Appellant  had
    taken him to school for a limited period of six weeks only and rejected
    evidence that  Hayden  would  be  distressed  by  the  absence  of  the
    Appellant noting that the Appellant had lived with Hayden at most three
    to four months prior to arrest and for a short period after release and
    that two periods  of  three  months  separated  by  one  year  did  not
    demonstrate that the Appellant had a quasi parental role with him  (see
    paragraph 24).  In relation to Dwayne it was noted that he was born  in
    November 2011 and was only 4 months old at the time the Appellant  went
    into prison.  It was accepted that the Appellant was  Dwayne's  natural
    father but in the light of the history he had had limited time with his
    son and the panel concluded that there was no long-term  commitment  to
    his care.  Drawing together  those  findings  the  panel  concluded  at
    paragraph 25:-

         "With regard to the interests of the children under Section  55  of
         the 2009 Act, the Appellant's stepson has his father in the UK, who
         retains an interest in  the  child  and  occasionally  visits.   No
         evidence has been available from the father  on  his  view  of  the
         involvement of the Appellant and his son's  upbringing.   Prior  to
         the last three months the Appellant had  another  short  period  of
         involvement with the children  before  his  sentence  and  saw  the
         children at five or six prison visits, he has not been able to show
         any long-term commitment to their care.  He was shown no ability to
         be  able  to  provide  for  the  children  without   resorting   to
         criminality.  The Tribunal finds that any claimed interest  of  the
         children as to  the  presence  of  the  Appellant  is  considerably
         outweighed by the public interest.  In accordance with both Section
         55 and ZH Tanzania, the welfare of the children is  a  primary  but
         not the only consideration. ...

         "... The Tribunal is satisfied that the welfare of the children has
         been given due weight when considered with  the  other  factors  in
         this appeal, and that the deportation is not contrary to Section 55
         of the 2009 Act."

34. It is plain from paragraph 25 that the panel did have regard to Section
    55 and the best interests of both children.   Even  if  the  panel  had
    identified that it was in  the  best  interests  of  both  children  to
    continue in their relationship with the Appellant by him living in  the
    UK, the panel correctly identified that the welfare of the children was
    a primary and not the only consideration and  that  on  the  particular
    facts of this case "that any claimed interest of the children as to the
    presence of the Appellant is  considerably  outweighed  by  the  public
    interest" (see paragraph 25).  The countervailing factors that had been
    identified by the panel  that  they  weighed  in  the  balance  are  as
    follows; firstly the gravity of the offence (the details of the offence
    were set out at paragraph 23), the merit  was  noted  that  he  pleaded
    guilty to serious offences and he was found to be  in  possession  with
    intent to supply nineteen wraps of class A drugs,  both  crack  cocaine
    and heroin, with the clear intention of supplying and dealing in drugs.
     This was  not  two  packages  but  involvement  in  an  enterprise  to
    distribute the drugs to a number of people on a commercial scale.   The
    panel noted that the judge continued his  remarks  by  underlining  the
    seriousness of the offence and the effect  that  drug  dealing  had  on
    people's lives.  Whilst it was recognised  he  did  not  have  a  large
    number of previous convictions, he  was  nonetheless  in  breach  of  a
    community service order which had been  imposed  as  a  result  of  two
    convictions for battery.  The panel also noted that had he not  pleaded
    guilty, the sentencing judge had noted that  the  sentence  would  have
    been one in the region of two years.  As to the charge relating to  the
    prohibited weapon, the panel took into account the oral evidence of the
    Appellant in which he claimed he  pleaded  guilty  to  the  offence  of
    possession of a prohibited weapon which was a taser gun  in  the  house
    which the police found upon their attendance but claimed  that  he  did
    not know it was prohibited.  Nonetheless he had kept that taser gun  in
    a house which he shared  with  his  partner  and  children.   Thus  the
    Tribunal found:-

         "The Appellant has been convicted of serious offences which  are  a
         danger to society, has criminal convictions of violence, being  two
         matters of burglary which the Appellant accepted involved  a  fight
         with a boyfriend of one of  the  Appellant's  female  friends.   In
         addition, the Appellant  has  accepted  in  evidence  that  he  was
         prepared to keep a prohibited weapon in his house, which he  shared
         with his partner and two young children."

    At paragraph 25, the panel noted again when weighing  the  question  of
    proportionality under Article 8 of the ECHR that: "this  Appellant  was
    found to be dealing in class A drugs, which wreck  people's  lives  and
    are a danger to society".  The panel took  into  account  his  criminal
    record concerning a number of offences that he has  been  convicted  of
    and his breach of the community  order,  the  fact  that  he  had  been
    dealing in drugs (paragraph 25).  The panel also took into account  his
    failure to meet the Immigration Rules (see paragraph 25).  The Court of
    Appeal in MF (Nigeria) recognised that in the balancing exercise, great
    weight should be given to the  public  interest  in  deporting  foreign
    criminals who do not satisfy paragraph 398, 399 or 399A (see paragraphs
    40 to 41).  A further countervailing  factor  taken  into  account  and
    weighed in the balance was his immigration history (see paragraph  24),
    the precarious nature of his existence, having  entered  illegally  and
    never applied for any form  of  leave,  that  he  had  entered  into  a
    relationship with Miss Tyzack in full knowledge that he had no leave to
    remain and would be liable for removal or deportation having  committed
    criminal offences.

      In those circumstances, it  was  open  to  the  panel  to  reach  the
    conclusion that any claimed interest of the children as to the presence
    of the Appellant which was that it was in their best interests for  him
    to remain, was considerably outweighed by the public  interest,  was  a
    finding that was entirely open to them on the evidence and the  balance
    of the countervailing factors that they identified as set out above.

35. One of the countervailing reasons referred to the risk  of  reoffending
    which the panel made reference to as a  "medium  risk  of  reoffending"
    (see paragraph 25).  It has been submitted on behalf of  the  Appellant
    that the panel made an error of  fact.   Mr  Allen  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State submits that it was not an error of fact but that it
    was a matter of weight that the panel preferred the evidence  from  the
    pre-sentence report to the evidence in the letter.

36.   I have considered the evidence that was before the panel in  relation
    to risk of reoffending and risk of  harm  to  the  public.   The  first
    document that refers to  any  risk  of  harm  is  at  page  19  of  the
    Appellant's bundle which is an undated letter from Officer Stockley  of
    the Offender Management Unit.  The letter states: "I have read the pre-
    sentence report regarding Mr Boateng which states that he is  a  medium
    risk of serious harm and also a  medium  risk  of  reconviction".   The
    presentence report was not before the panel but the presentence  report
    would have given details as to how the author of the report had made an
    assessment of the risk that the Appellant posed at the time that it was
    written.  In an updated bundle at page 8 there was a letter dated  15th
    May 2013 from a probation officer.  It was noted in the letter that the
    Appellant had attended for probation on  a  weekly  basis  since  being
    released on licence in March 2013.  It was noted that he  was  engaging
    well with supervision  and  sought  appropriate  help  and  support  to
    address issues he may  have.   Reference  was  made  to  the  Appellant
    working with education, training and employability and that he would be
    undertaking weekly literacy classes.  The letter goes on to state:  "he
    is assessed as posing a low risk of harm to  the  public  and  is  also
    assessed as a low risk of reoffending".

37. What the panel said about this is set out at paragraph 24.  They record
    the following:-

         "The letter from  the  Offender  Management  Unit  noted  that  the
         presentence report concluded that there was a medium  risk  of  the
         Appellant causing  serious  harm  of  reoffending.   The  Appellant
         stated that he had  been  assessed  as  being  at  a  low  risk  of
         reoffending but had  not  submitted  any  written  report  of  this
         assessment."

    At paragraph 25 the panel recorded again: "the Appellant was considered
    to be at a medium risk of reoffending".

38. As can be seen  from  paragraph  24,  the  panel's  recitation  of  the
    evidence from the letter of the Offender  Management  Unit  was  not  a
    mistake of fact.  There was  indeed  a  letter  which  noted  that  the
    presentence report concluded that  there  was  a  medium  risk  of  the
    Appellant causing serious harm of reoffending.   The  panel  were  also
    right in stating that the Appellant had told  them  that  he  had  been
    assessed at being a low risk of reoffending but had not  submitted  any
    written report of this assessment.  The letter at page 8 was not a risk
    assessment report although it is right to observe that  the  conclusion
    of the probation officer was that he had been assessed as posing a  low
    risk of harm to the public and assessed as a low risk  of  reoffending.
    No  such  assessment  had  been  provided  as  noted  by   the   panel.
    Nonetheless whilst I am satisfied there was no mistake of fact in  that
    respect, the letter of  15th  May  2013  notwithstanding  the  lack  of
    assessment report to support it, did state  that  he  was  assessed  as
    posing a low risk of harm to the public and  of  reoffending.   However
    even if it were an error of fact, I do not find it to be a material one
    or one which would have materially affected the outcome of this  appeal
    on its own particular individual facts as found by the panel.  As Upper
    Tribunal  Judge  Storey  and  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Sommerville
    observed,  there  were  a  number  of  weighty  countervailing  factors
    identified by the panel and that in any event the legitimate aim of the
    prevention of crime  is  not  confined  to  those  who  are  likely  to
    reoffend. The jurisprudence in deportation appeals,  indicate  that  in
    cases  affecting  public  confidence  in  the  criminal   justice   and
    immigration system, the deportation of offenders has a legitimate  role
    in the deterrence of others who might be minded to offend.   For  those
    reasons, I am satisfied that even if that was a mistake of fact it  did
    not materially affect the outcome of the appeal given  the  number  and
    weight of the other countervailing factors identified by the panel.

39. For those reasons I am satisfied that the panel did carry out a careful
    and correct assessment for proportionality factors in this  appeal  and
    that the decision that they made was  entirely  open  to  them  on  the
    particular facts of this case.

40. I am satisfied that the panel were entitled to  reach  the  conclusions
    that they did in this appeal after carrying out a careful assessment of
    the evidence and reaching a conclusion as to where the balance lay.  In
    this  case  they  found  that  it  lay  in   favour   of   deportation.
    Consequently I find that there is no error of law in the  determination
    of the panel.

Decision

41. The First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve the making of an error
    of law; the decision stands.  The appeal is dismissed.
