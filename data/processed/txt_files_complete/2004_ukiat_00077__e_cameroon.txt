Representation:

For the appellant:           Miss K Prendergast, Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the respondent:          Her sponsor's husband, Mr Nzembala Kabamba

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, Entry Clearance Officer,  appeals  with  leave  of  the
      Tribunal against the determination of an Adjudicator (Mr  G  Jamieson)
      allowing the visit appeal of the respondent, a citizen of Cameroon.

2.    The respondent, who now would be referred to as the claimant,  applied
      for entry clearance  to  the  United  Kingdom  to  visit  her  sister,
      Madeline Neh in Bedford to participate  in  her  sister's  traditional
      marriage to Nzembala Kabamba.    The Entry Clearance  Officer  refused
      the application by decision dated 24 April 2003, pointing out that her
      sister had already married in 1999,  and  that  the  claimant  and  no
      invitation to a traditional wedding and did  not  even  know  when  it
      would take place.  The claimant had also failed to produce evidence as
      to her sister's immigration status in  the  UK.     In  addition,  the
      Entry Clearance Officer considered  that  the  claimant  had  produced
      forged documents and her reliance on these documents seriously damaged
      her credibility as a genuine visitor.     He  also  doubted  that  the
      claimant was related to the sponsor.

3.    In  response  to  the  refusal  the  claimant  produced  a  number  of
      documents, including an invitation  to  the  traditional  wedding,  an
      endorsement of her sister's passport showing that her  sister  had  no
      time limit on her stay in the United Kingdom, a copy of  her  marriage
      certificate showing her husband to be a  medical  doctor.    She  also
      produced a bank statement showing that she had over  ï¿½4,000  available
      to her during her visit.     The Adjudicator was satisfied with  these
      documents and was  satisfied  that  the  claimant  would  be  able  to
      maintain and accommodate herself adequately without recourse to public
      funds.

4.    The Entry Clearance Officer had doubts about  the  documents  produced
      by the claimant in relation to her employment.   He  also  had  doubts
      about her place of employment, which was said to be A Z  International
      Ltd.

5.    It would appear from the determination that  the  Adjudicator  himself
      had doubts about the claimant's place of employment.     In  spite  of
      these doubts he did not agree with Entry Clearance  Officer  that  the
      claimant had produced forged documents in relation to a company  which
      either did not exist or in which she was not a Secretary.     The  ECO
      had telephoned the company and had said that the telephone number  was
      a call box and the person to whom she had spoken claimed not  to  know
      the claimant.   At paragraph 12 of the determination, it was  apparent
      that the Adjudicator himself had checked the website  address  of  the
      company on the internet on 8 July 2003 and had found that it  was  not
      available.    In spite of this he stated that these things can  change
      and therefore would not seek to draw from this that the  claimant  had
      produced forged documents from A Z International Ltd.

6.    The Adjudicator then allowed  the  appeal  and  issued  directions  in
      order to give effect to his determination.

7.    The appellant appealed against those directions on  the  grounds  that
      in asking the Entry Clearance Officer  to  make  enquiries  about  the
      claimant's place  of  employment,  the  Adjudicator  was  placing  the
      standard of proof on the wrong party.    Miss  Prendergast  relied  on
      the grounds of appeal.    She submitted  that  the  onus  was  on  the
      claimant to show that she is employed by A Z  International  Ltd  once
      the Entry Clearance Officer had found that she  did  not.    When  the
      Adjudicator set directions for the Entry Clearance  Officer  to  grant
      entry clearance, which Miss Prendergast said he was  entitled  to  do,
      his placement of a  condition  that  the  claimant  obtains  from  the
      Ministry  of  Commerce  and  Finance  in  Cameroon  proof  as  to  the
      incorporation of  A  Z  International  Ltd  as  a  bona  fide  company
      operating in Cameroon, undermined his earlier findings.

8.    In reply the sponsor stated that the Adjudicator  gave  directions  to
      the Entry Clearance Officer to carry out further investigations  about
      A Z International  Ltd.    We  pointed  out  to  him  that  the  Entry
      Clearance  Officer  was  under  no  obligation  to  carry   out   such
      investigation.    The onus was on the claimant  to  produce  proof  of
      evidence that A Z International was a bona fide company  operating  in
      Cameroon.  Mr Kabamba did not have proof of this.

9.    The duty of an Adjudicator is to allow or dismiss  an  appeal  and  he
      may issue directions in order to give  effect  to  his  determination.
      What the Adjudicator is not in a position to do  is  issue  directions
      amounting to an investigation of  the  part  of  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer or issue directions which appear contingent on  his  decision.
      The onus is on a claimant to prove their case.   In requiring the  ECO
      to undertake an investigation in order to prove the bona fides of A  Z
      International Limited, the Adjudicator was  effectively  shifting  the
      burden of proof on to the ECO.   This amounts to an error in law.

10.   In my opinion the existence of  the  company  the  claimant  said  she
      worked for was relevant to her credibility.  The Adjudicator obviously
      has doubts about this otherwise he would not have checked the  website
      address.  In this regard, I  should  say  that  it  is  generally  not
      satisfactory for an Adjudicator to make their own investigation on the
      internet without giving the parties an  opportunity  to  respond.   In
      this case the Adjudicator did not hold his  negative  finding  against
      the respondent so no unfairness was  caused.   Nevertheless  the  fact
      remains that, had the Adjudicator not had doubts about the company, he
      would not have  issued  a  direction  contingent  upon  production  of
      evidence from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry  in  Cameroon,  or
      some other suitable source, as to the incorporation of the company for
      which she works, A Z International Ltd  as  a  bona  fide  company  of
      rating in Cameroon.     In  view  of  the  doubts  that  he  had,  the
      Adjudicator should have dismissed the appeal.  He  erred  in  allowing
      the appeal and erred in issuing the directions in the terms set out in
      his determination.

11.   Therefore, on the totality of the evidence before us we cannot  uphold
      the Adjudicator's determination  and  directions.     The  appellant's
      appeal is allowed.
