                                   Before

                         UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE REEDS

                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

                               SHYRYRI ISMAILI
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr  Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    The appellant in person

                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL
  pursuant to Rule 17 (5) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
                                    2008

  1. By an application made orally, the Secretary of State has notified the
     Upper Tribunal that she wished to withdraw the appeal.



  2. Paragraph 17 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
     provides for a party to withdraw its  case  before  the  UT  with  the
     consent of the Tribunal but there is  no  provision  for  a  party  to
     withdraw  the  appeal  before  the  Upper  Tribunal.   Therefore   the
     Appellant's oral request that they do not intend to pursue the appeal,
     serves only as notice of withdrawal of their case before the UT  which
     takes effect because the UT now provides consent required by paragraph
     17(2).


  3. Therefore, pursuant to Rule 17(2) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
     Tribunal) Rules 2008, as a notice of withdrawal will not  take  effect
     until the Upper Tribunal consents to the withdrawal, I now  give  that
     consent.

OUTCOME

      The appeal is withdrawn.
