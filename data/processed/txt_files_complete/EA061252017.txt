Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Karnik, instructed by R & A solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the  appellant  in
this determination identified as SE.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
others, all parties. Any failure to comply with this  direction  could  give
rise to contempt of court proceedings

      1. SE, a Nigerian citizen, appealed a decision of the  SSHD  refusing,
         for reasons set out in a decision dated 14th June  2017,  to  issue
         him with an EEA family permit as the adopted child of OE, a Spanish
         national and his wife BE, a British Citizen. It is accepted by  the
         respondent that OE is exercising Treaty Rights and has a  permanent
         right of residence in the UK; that SE  was  adopted  in  accordance
         with Nigerian law on 15th  September  2015;  that  Nugent  Adoption
         approved  SE's  adoptive  parents  as  suitable  for   intercountry
         adoption for him and the Department of Education confirmed that the
         parents had been assessed and approved as eligible and suitable  to
         be adoptive parents in accordance with  Part  4  Adoption  Agencies
         Regulations 2005.

      2. The family permit was refused because an  adoption  under  Nigerian
         law is not recognised under the Adoption (Recognition  of  Overseas
         Adoptions (Order) 2013 and so the appellant was not a family member
         for EEA purposes.

      3. The appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Mark  Davies
         for reasons set out in a decision promulgated  on  4th  April  2018
         which, in summary, found that because the adoption of SE in Nigeria
         was not recognised as meeting  the  requirements  of  the  Adoption
         (Recognition of Overseas Adoptions) Order 2013, he could  not  meet
         the requirements of regulation  7  Immigration  (European  Economic
         Area) Regulations 2016. Although pleaded - albeit badly - the First-
         tier Tribunal judge refused to hear argument that the  decision  to
         refuse a permit breached Article 8, stating that Article 8 was  not
         engaged.

      4. Permission to appeal was sought on the following grounds:

             "The Immigration Judge erred in law  by  failing  to  consider
             Article 8 during the hearing.

             The Immigration Judge did  not  consider  the  fact  that  the
             appellant in  this  case  had  completed  fully  the  adoption
             process both in Nigeria and here in the United Kingdom and  as
             such qualifies to be considered under Article  8  as  well  as
             under the regulations."

      5. Permission to appeal was granted by UTJ Kebede on the grounds  that
         it was arguable the judge had failed to consider  Article  8  which
         had been pleaded  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal and was considered by the  ECM.  She  did  not  limit  the
         grounds of challenge.

      6. Before me, Mr Karnik sought to expand  the  grounds  of  appeal  to
         include a challenge to the refusal under the EEA regulations, in so
         far as permission may not have been granted, and for  an  extension
         of time for the ground to be argued: SM (Algeria) v ECO [2018] UKSC
         9 had not been brought to the attention of the First-tier  Tribunal
         judge; it is not  acte  clair  that  a  child  in  the  appellant's
         position is not to be  regarded  as  a  direct  descendant  of  his
         adoptive parents and thus it was wrong for the First-tier  Tribunal
         to reach the finding that the child was not a direct descendant for
         the purposes of the EEA Regulations.

      7. Mr Tan opposed the amendment/expansion: first any such  application
         was well out of time and secondly the appellant had had ample  time
         in which to  formulate  the  grounds  more  precisely.  He  however
         confirmed that if I were to grant the amendment/expansion  then  he
         did not require an adjournment to enable him to make submissions.

      8. I allowed the amendment/expansion of the grounds.  SM  should  have
         been brought to the attention of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge;
         although UTJ Kebede did not specifically grant  permission  on  the
         Regulations decision, it  was  pleaded  (albeit  sparsely)  in  the
         application for permission and she did not limit the grounds.

    Error of Law

      9. The respondent, at the date of the appeal, did not have  copies  of
         the documents that had been submitted with the application. A  copy
         of the covering letter of application for the residence permit  was
         not before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  (although  a  copy  was
         provided to me). I  did  not  take  that  letter  into  account  in
         deciding whether there was a material error of law.

     10. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal were:

             "The decision is not in accordance with the Immigration Rules.
             The Rules do not exclude Nigeria as a country  where  adoption
             should not be accepted. The Entry Clearance Officer has failed
             to apply the Immigration Rules appropriately on this  occasion
             especially when the previous refusal is considered alongside."

     11. I had a copy of the record of proceedings made  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal judge, which is stated in bold in capital letters to  have
         been typed verbatim onto a laptop computer in the hearing  room.  I
         read relevant extracts from the record to both parties who did  not
         object or disagree with the contents (I should note that neither Mr
         Karnik nor Mr Tan appeared  below,  but  the  notes  accorded  with
         whatever record they each had).

     12. According to the Record, the First-tier Tribunal judge:

           . Informed the appellant's representative that he  cannot  argue
             an Article 8 appeal under EEA Regulations;

           . That he, the judge, had 'totally  failed'  to  appreciate  the
             appellant's case;

           .  That  the  appellant's  representative  'totally  fails'   to
             appreciate that he cannot argue Article 8;

           . The respondent in submissions relied upon the Entry  Clearance
             Officer's decision and the Entry Clearance Manager's decision,
             that as an EEA decision the Immigration Rules do not apply;

           . The appellant's representative  relied  upon  his  handwritten
             skeleton argument, prepared on the day of  the  hearing  which
             said, inter alia, the sponsors had complied with the advice of
             adoption agencies, the ECO appeared  to  have  considered  and
             been satisfied that the sponsor/appellant met  paragraph  316A
             Immigration Rules; the appellant relies upon paragraph 309B of
             the Rules and s83 Adoption and  Children  Act  2002  and  thus
             regulation 7 is engaged.

     13. The First-tier  Tribunal  judge  did  not  permit  the  appellant's
         representative to make submissions regarding Article 8 even  though
         (albeit in badly formulated  grounds  of  appeal)  the  Immigration
         Rules were raised as an issue and, as per Sales LJ  in  Amirteymour
         [2017] EWCA Civ 353[1]  [33] "the  Immigration  Rules  have  always
         covered many if not most cases in which a right to enter or  remain
         could be established under Article 8... and a common way in which a
         claim based on Article 8 arises is as an adjunct to a  claim  based
         on the Immigration Rules themselves." Upon receipt of the  grounds,
         the ECM considered and reviewed  the  decision  of  the  ECO  under
         Article 8.  The First-tier  Tribunal  judge  gave  no  reasons  for
         refusing to hear the Article 8 appeal.

     14. It was not argued that the First-tier Tribunal judge had  erred  in
         concluding  that  adoptions  completed  under  Nigerian  law   were
         recognised.  As  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Davies   said,   the
         appellant's 'adoptive' parents appear to have been misinformed that
         his  Nigerian  adoption  order  was   recognised   under   Adoption
         (Recognition of Overseas Adoptions) (Order) 2013.

     15. It was accepted that the appellant had not made a paid  application
         for entry clearance to be issued in accordance with the Immigration
         Rules. The decision the subject of appeal states

             "You have applied for an EEA family permit to  accompany  [OE]
             to the United Kingdom as his adoptive child. I have considered
             your  application  under  regulation  7  of  the   Immigration
             (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

             ...

             You  are  entitled  to  appeal  against  this  decision  under
             regulation 36 of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
             regulations 2016 ...

             The appeal must be brought on the ground t hath  the  decision
             breaches your rights under the  EU  Treaties  in  relation  to
             entry to, or residence in, the United Kingdom ..."

    Ground 1- was there a human rights appeal that was not considered?

     16. Mr Tan submitted that Amirteymour was  a  complete  answer:  in  an
         appeal under the EEA Regulations it was not possible to introduce a
         new human rights claim in an appeal before the First-tier Tribunal;
         if an applicant wished to make a claim for leave to remain based on
         human rights a relevant application has to be made to the  SSHD  to
         rely upon those rights.

     17. Mr Amirteymour had, whilst in the  UK,  applied  for  a  derivative
         residence card as confirmation of his right of residence  under  EU
         law as a primary carer. He also sought to rely on Article 8 but had
         not made  an  application  under  the  relevant  immigration  rules
         (Appendix FM). In refusing the derivative residence card, the  SSHD
         had observed that Mr Amirteymour had not made an application  under
         the relevant Immigration Rules,  that  refusal  of  the  derivative
         residence card did not require him to leave,  that  if  he  had  no
         alternative  basis  for  staying  in  the  UK,   he   should   make
         arrangements to leave. No removal directions were made.  The  Upper
         Tribunal considered the rights of appeal under Regulation 26 of the
         EEA regulations; whether a human rights challenge to removal  could
         be brought in such an appeal when no s120 notice  had  been  served
         and where no EEA decision to remove had been  made.  The  Court  of
         Appeal confirmed that the Upper Tribunal was correct in  concluding
         that in an appeal  under  regulation  26  of  the  EEA  Regulations
         against a decision to refuse to issue a derivative  residence  card
         where no removal directions have been issued  and  no  s120  notice
         given, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain a  case  based
         on the Immigration Rules or on Article 8  outside  the  Immigration
         Rules (paragraph 21).

     18. Paragraph 22 of Amirteymour refers to  the  difference  between  an
         application for a derivative residence card  which  is  based  upon
         directly effective rights under EU law and an application for leave
         to enter or remain under the Immigration Rules  and/or  Article  8.
         Sales LJ held

             "27. In my judgment, the natural meaning of  the  phrase  "may
             appeal under these Regulations against an  EEA  decision",  as
             used in regulation 26(1), is that the  appeal  rights  thereby
             created is in respect of an EEA decision and is to proceed  by
             reference to grounds of claim and grounds of appeal of a  kind
             recognised as  creating  entitlements  under  the  Regulations
             themselves (recognising, as they  do,  entitlements  under  EU
             law). This interpretation means that  it  is  not  within  the
             jurisdiction of the FTT in this case to allow the appellant to
             introduce into his appeal under regulation 26 a claim directed
             to the exercise of  the  Secretary  of  State's  discretionary
             powers under the 1971 Act and based upon Article 8.

             28.  ... It might  arguably  be  acceptable  to  introduce  on
             appeal against an EEA  decision,  subject  to  the  Tribunal's
             procedural rules and the overriding objective, some new matter
             going to an entitlement under EU law and the EEA  Regulations,
             since those were the Regulations which the Secretary of  State
             had been asked to apply when making her decision under appeal,
             and hence it might be within the jurisdiction of the  Tribunal
             under regulation 26(1) to allow this (although  I  express  no
             concluded view about this). But  it  would  be  a  recipe  for
             procedural chaos and potentially unfair to  the  Secretary  of
             State to allow an applicant who applies to  the  Secretary  of
             State under EEA Regulations to change his case  completely  on
             an appeal under regulation 26 so as to rely  on  a  new  claim
             which  does  not  depend  upon  any  entitlement   under   the
             regulations at all, as has happened in the present case.  That
             would subvert to an unacceptable degree the intended  decision
             making process, which is supposed to begin with the  Secretary
             of State first having an opportunity to decide whether such  a
             case (here, the appellant's case based on Article 8)  is  made
             out  or  not,  followed  by  an  appeal  in  respect  of  that
             "immigration decision.

             29.  ... Regulation 26(2) to (3A) therefore indicate that  the
             jurisdiction of the Tribunal under regulation 26(1) was indeed
             confined to arguments based on the EEA Regulations.

             30.  Where a person applies to the Secretary of State for some
             right  or  benefit  under  the  EEA  regulations  based   upon
             entitlements under EU law,  such  as  a  derivative  residence
             card, if the Secretary of State made reference in her decision
             to Article 8 (say, by mistake or  because  the  applicant  had
             referred to  article  8  in  the  course  of  filling  in  his
             application form under regulation  18A)  as  well  as  to  his
             entitlements  under  the  EEA  Regulations,  that   would   be
             irrelevant surplusage. The Article 8 section of  the  decision
             in such a case would  not  form  part  of  the  relevant  "EEA
             decision"  and  there  would  be  no  right  of  appeal  under
             regulation 26 in respect of that section of the decision. This
             being so, it would be very odd to infer an  intention  on  the
             part of the drafter of  regulation  26(1)  that  the  Tribunal
             should nonetheless  have  jurisdiction  to  exercise  its  own
             discretion to allow an appellant to introduce such a  distinct
             Article 8 claim at  a  later  stage,  on  the  appeal  to  the
             Tribunal....(....if the  Secretary  of  State  did  happen  to
             address Article 8 arguments in her decision letter in  such  a
             case, it might be possible to say that the Secretary of  State
             had waived the requirement  for  an  application  form  to  be
             completed  in  respect  of  her  exercise  of   her   residual
             discretion under the 1971 Act by reference to  Article  8  and
             that she had then made two decisions,  an  "EEA  decision"  in
             relation to entitlements under  the  EEA  Regulations  and  an
             "immigration decision" within the scope of s82(1) of the  2002
             Act, with distinct rights of appeal under regulation 26(1) and
             under s82(1) respectively ..."

     19. Mr Karnik submitted that JM [2006] EWCA Civ 1402  established  that
         even where article 8 was not  raised  in  an  application  but  was
         subsequently raised during the course of an appeal  then  once  the
         human rights point was properly before the Tribunal,  the  Tribunal
         was obliged to deal with it.  JM was not an  appeal  brought  under
         the EEA Regulations but was an appeal  (with  a  rather  convoluted
         background) that was initially brought against  the  refusal  of  a
         protection claim. JM was decided  (as  was  Amirteymour)  when  the
         "old" statutory appeal regime which enabled an appeal to be brought
         against an immigration decision, defined as including a decision to
         remove a person from the UK. The grounds upon which such a decision
         could be appealed included that the decision was unlawful under  s6
         of the Human  Rights  Act  1998  as  being  incompatible  with  the
         person's Convention Rights.  Amirteymour (in [43]) noted that in JM
         a s120 notice had been served: it was held that JM was entitled  to
         raise human rights arguments regarding his right to remain  in  the
         UK.

     20. Mr Karnik also submitted that TY (Sri Lanka) [2015] EWCA  Civ  1233
         was not authority for the proposition that a public  authority  can
         decline to consider article 8 where it has been raised in  relation
         to a decision which potentially interferes  with  that  right.   TY
         considered whether the Tribunal  had  jurisdiction  to  consider  a
         claim for asylum/leave to remain on  human  rights  grounds  in  an
         appeal brought against a decision to refuse a derivative  right  of
         residence under the EEA Regulations[2]. Jackson LJ held:

             "27. Since there is  no  section  120  one  stop  notice,  the
             appellant is confined to the subject matter  of  the  original
             decision. That is a  decision  that  the  appellant  does  not
             fulfil the requirements of the EEA Regulations. That  decision
             was  unquestionably  correct.  However  strong  or  weak   the
             appellant's claims may be under the provisions of the  Refugee
             Convention and ECHR, those provisions could  not  entitle  the
             appellant  to  receive  a  residence  card   under   the   EEA
             Regulations.

             ...

             34.  ... the crucial feature of JM was that the  Secretary  of
             State served a section 120 one stop notice: see last  sentence
             of [23]. That has two consequences. First, if  M's  appeal  to
             the AIT failed the Secretary of State would be able to proceed
             to removal without giving M any  opportunity  to  raise  human
             rights  arguments  or  to  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds.
             Secondly, M was fully entitled to advance  all  his  arguments
             under ECHR and the AIT was obliged to consider them.  The  AIT
             filed to do so, because it misconstrued s84(1)(g) of the  2002
             Act. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal allowed M's appeal.  The
             present case differs from JM in a crucial respect, namely that
             there was no one stop notice under s120.

             35.  It is impossible to say that  the  Secretary  of  State's
             decision to withhold a residence card  (a  decision  which  is
             correct under the EEA Regulations) will or could cause the  UK
             to be in breach of the Refugee Convention or ECHR. The UK will
             only be in breach of those Conventions if in  the  future  the
             appellant makes an asylum or human  rights  claim,  which  the
             Secretary of State and/or the tribunals incorrectly reject."

     21. Mr Karnik submitted that an "entry clearance" case is fundamentally
         different to a case where a person  is  exercising  or  seeking  to
         exercise EU rights whilst in the UK. He submits that JM established
         that when  a  human  rights  issue  is  before  an  authority,  the
         authority is seized of that issue and is required to determine  it.
         He pursues the submission (which was not pursued by Ms Jegarajah in
         TY) that, through Recital  31  of  Directive  2004/38[3]  and,  for
         example Dereci (European Citizenship) [2011] EUECJ C-256/11,  there
         is an obligation under Community law to give effect to the right to
         respect for family life. He relied upon Akrich  (Free  movement  of
         persons) [2003] EUECJ C-109/01 [61]:

             "...

             Where a national of a member state married to a national of  a
             non-member State with whom she is  living  in  another  Member
             State returns to the Member State of which she is  a  national
             in order to work there as an employed person and, at the  time
             of her return, her spouse does not enjoy the  rights  provided
             for in Article 10 of Regulation 1612/68  because  he  has  not
             resided lawfully on the  territory  of  a  Member  State,  the
             competent authorities of the first mentioned Member State,  in
             assessing the application by the spouse to enter and remain in
             that Member State, must non the less have regard to the  right
             to respect for family life under Article 8 of the  Convention,
             provided that the marriage is genuine."

     22. Mr Akrich was subject to a deportation order signed in the  UK.  He
         and his wife, a British Citizen, had resided in Ireland  where  she
         had exercised Treaty Rights. She then returned to the UK. Mr Akrich
         applied to revoke the deportation order and for entry clearance  to
         the UK. After an interview,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  to
         revoke the deportation order and, refused the application for entry
         clearance on the grounds that the application did not  fall  within
         Case C-370/90 Singh [1992] ECR I-4625 (Surinder Singh: 'exercise of
         EU rights for 6  months  in  a  different  member  state  and  then
         return'). Mr Akrich appealed both decisions. The Tribunal  referred
         the following to the ECJ:

             "Where a national of a Member State  is  married  to  a  third
             country  national  who  does  not   qualify   under   national
             legislation to enter or reside in that Member State, and moves
             to  another  Member  State  with  the   non-national   spouse,
             intending to exercise Community law rights when  returning  to
             the Member State of nationality together with the non-national
             spouse:

                   1) Is the Member State of nationality entitled to regard
                      the intention of the couple, when moving to the other
                      Member State, to claim the benefit of  Community  law
                      rights  when  returning  to  the  Member   State   of
                      nationality,   notwithstanding    the    non-national
                      spouse's  lack  of   qualification   under   national
                      legislation, as a reliance on Community law in  order
                      to evade the application of national legislation: and

                   2) If so, is the Member State of nationality entitled to
                      refuse:

                        a) To revoke any preliminary obstacle to  the  entry
                           of the non-national spouse into that Member State
                           (on  the  facts  of  this  case  an   outstanding
                           deportation order); and

                        b) To accord the  non-national  spouse  a  right  of
                           entry into its territory."

     23. It is useful to consider the discussion in Akrich which led to  the
         conclusion relied upon by Mr Karnik:

             "46. By its questions, which  it  is  appropriate  to  examine
             together, the referring tribunal  is  essentially  seeking  to
             ascertain the scope of the judgment in Singh in regard to  a
             situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings.

             47.  In that judgment the Court held that Article  52  of  the
             EEC Treaty (which became Article 52 of the EC  Treaty  and  is
             now, after amendment, Article 43  EC)  and  Council  Directive
             73/148 must be interpreted as  requiring  a  Member  State  to
             grant leave to enter  and  remain  in  its  territory  to  the
             spouse, of whatever nationality, of a national of  that  State
             who has gone, with that spouse, to  another  Member  State  in
             order to work there as an  employed  person  as  envisaged  by
             Article 48 of the EEC Treaty (which became Article 48  of  the
             EC Treaty and is now, after  amendment,  Article  39  EC)  and
             returns to  establish  himself  or  herself  as  envisaged  by
             Article 52 of the Treaty in the State of which he or she is  a
             national. Under the  operative  part  of  that  judgment,  the
             spouse must enjoy at least the same rights as would be granted
             to him or her under Community law if his or her spouse entered
             and remained in another Member State.

             48.  The same consequences flow from  Article  39  EC  if  the
             national of the Member State concerned envisages a  return  to
             that Member State in  order  to  work  there  as  an  employed
             person. Consequently, where the spouse is a national of a non-
             Member State he must enjoy at least the same rights  as  would
             be granted to him by Article 10 of Regulation  No  1612/68  if
             his or her spouse entered and resided in another Member State.

             49.  However, Regulation No 1612/68  covers  only  freedom  of
             movement within the Community. It is silent as to  the  rights
             of a national of a non-Member State, who is the  spouse  of  a
             citizen of the Union, in regard to access to the territory  of
             the Community.

             50.  In order to benefit in a situation such as that at  issue
             in the main  proceedings  from  the  rights  provided  for  in
             Article 10 of Regulation No 1612/68, the national  of  a  non-
             Member State, who is the spouse of a  citizen  of  the  Union,
             must be lawfully resident in a Member State when he  moves  to
             another Member State to which the  citizen  of  the  Union  is
             migrating or has migrated.

             51.  That interpretation is consistent with the  structure  of
             the Community provisions seeking to secure freedom of movement
             for workers within the  Community,  whose  exercise  must  not
             penalise the migrant worker and his family.

             52.  Where a citizen of the Union,  established  in  a  Member
             State and married to a national of a non-Member State  with  a
             right to remain in that Member State, moves to another  Member
             State in order to work there as an employed person, that  move
             must not result in the loss of  the  opportunity  lawfully  to
             live  together,  which  is  the  reason  why  Article  10   of
             Regulation No 1612/68 confers on  such  spouse  the  right  to
             install himself in that other Member State.

             53.  Conversely, where a citizen of the Union, established  in
             a Member State and married to a national of a non-Member State
             without the right to remain in that  Member  State,  moves  to
             another Member State in order to work  there  as  an  employed
             person, the fact that that person's spouse has no right  under
             Article 10 of Regulation No 1612/68 to  install  himself  with
             that person in the other Member State cannot  constitute  less
             favourable treatment than that which they enjoyed  before  the
             citizen made use of the opportunities afforded by  the  Treaty
             as regards movement of persons. Accordingly,  the  absence  of
             such a right is not such as to deter the citizen of the  Union
             from exercising the rights in regard to  freedom  of  movement
             conferred by Article 39 EC.

             54.  The same applies where a citizen of the Union married  to
             a national of a non-Member State returns to the  Member  State
             of which he or she is a national in order to work there as  an
             employed person. If the citizen's spouse has a valid right  to
             remain in another Member State, Article 10  of  Regulation  No
             1612/68 applies so that  the  citizen  of  the  Union  is  not
             deterred from exercising  his  or  her  right  to  freedom  of
             movement on returning to the Member State of which he  or  she
             is a national. If, conversely, that citizen's spouse does  not
             already have a valid right to remain in another Member  State,
             the absence of any  right  of  the  spouse  under  Article  10
             aforesaid to install himself or herself with  the  citizen  of
             the Union does not have a dissuasive effect in that regard.

             55.  As regards the question of abuse mentioned  at  paragraph
             24 of the Singh judgment, cited above, it should be  mentioned
             that the motives which may have prompted a worker of a  Member
             State to seek employment in another Member  State  are  of  no
             account as regards his  right  to  enter  and  reside  in  the
             territory of the latter State provided that he  there  pursues
             or wishes to pursue an effective and  genuine  activity  (Case
             53/81 Levin [1982] ECR 1035, paragraph 23).

             56.  Nor are such motives  relevant  in  assessing  the  legal
             situation of the couple at the time of  their  return  to  the
             Member State of which the worker is a national.  Such  conduct
             cannot constitute an abuse within the meaning of paragraph  24
             of the Singh judgment even if the spouse did not, at the time
             when the couple installed itself in another Member State, have
             a right to remain in the Member State of which the worker is a
             national.

             57.  Conversely, there would be an  abuse  if  the  facilities
             afforded by Community law in favour  of  migrant  workers  and
             their spouses were invoked in  the  context  of  marriages  of
             convenience entered into in order to circumvent the provisions
             relating to entry and residence  of  nationals  of  non-Member
             States.

             58.  That said, where the marriage is genuine  and  where,  on
             the return of the citizen of the Union to the Member State  of
             which he is a national, his spouse, who is a national of a non-
             Member State and with whom he was living in the  Member  State
             which he is leaving, is not lawfully resident on the territory
             of a Member State, regard must be had to  respect  for  family
             life under Article  8  of  the  European  Convention  for  the
             Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed at
             Rome on 4 November 1950 (hereinafter 'the  Convention').  That
             right is among the fundamental rights which, according to  the
             Court's settled case-law, restated  by  the  preamble  to  the
             Single European Act and by Article 6(2) EU, are  protected  in
             the Community legal order.

             59.  Even though the Convention does not as such guarantee the
             right of an alien to  enter  or  to  reside  in  a  particular
             country, the removal of a person from a  country  where  close
             members of his family are living may amount to an infringement
             of the right to respect  for  family  life  as  guaranteed  by
             Article 8(1) of the  Convention.  Such  an  interference  will
             infringe the Convention if it does not meet  the  requirements
             of paragraph 2 of that  article,  that  is  unless  it  is  in
             accordance with the law, motivated  by  one  or  more  of  the
             legitimate aims  under  that  paragraph  and  necessary  in  a
             democratic society, that is to say  justified  by  a  pressing
             social  need  and,  in  particular,   proportionate   to   the
             legitimate aim pursued (Case C-60/00 Carpenter [2002] ECR I-
             6279, paragraph 42).

             60.  The limits of what is 'necessary in a democratic society'
             where  the  spouse  has  committed  an   offence   have   been
             highlighted  by   the   European   Court   of   Human   Rights
             in Boultif v Switzerland, judgment of 2 August 2001, Reports
             of  Judgments   and   Decisions 2001-IX   ��   46   to   56,
             and Amrollahi v Denmark, judgment of 11 July 2002, not  yet
             published in the Reports of Judgments and Decisions, �� 33  to
             44.

     24. Although there have been amendments to the  EEA  regulations  since
         the  cases  relied  upon  were  decided,  those  changes   do   not
         fundamentally affect the rights recognised under the Regulations.

     25.  A  residence  permit  issued  under  the  EEA  regulations,  which
         implement EU law, are declaratory of rights under EU law; they  are
         not a grant of permission to enter or remain  in  the  UK  but  the
         manifestation of a right. A person either has that  right  (at  the
         time the permit is issued)  or  does  not  and  that  right  exists
         according to the Directive, as implemented into UK law through  the
         Regulations.  Leave to enter/remain in the UK under the Immigration
         Rules within the statutory framework established to enable  such  a
         grant to be made is however a grant  of  leave  that  continues  to
         exist unless and until it is curtailed or expires.  Such  leave  is
         granted according  to  a  framework  established  and  approved  by
         Parliament. That framework sets out the  particular  criteria  that
         have to be met in order to be given that leave to enter or  remain.
         Although in practical terms they may be seen by a lay person to  be
         the same creature, they are not. The first is a right, enshrined in
         EU law; the second is a discretion of the UK government  to  enable
         entry and stay in the UK of particular categories  of  individuals,
         albeit a discretion the exercise  of  which  is  moderated  through
         Immigration Rules and  policies  established  through  a  statutory
         framework.

     26. Mr Karnik is correct that  where  the  Tribunal  is  seized  of  an
         Article 8 issue, the Tribunal is required to determine it. This  is
         well established. But the issue here is 'is the Tribunal seized  of
         an Article 8 issue?'. If the answer to that is 'yes',  then  First-
         tier Tribunal judge Davies erred in law in not determining  it.  If
         the answer to that is 'no' then there is no material error of law.

     27. That the appeals brought in JM, TY and Amirteymour were brought  by
         appellants in the UK and this appeal relates to an appellant not in
         the UK is not, in my view, of any  import.  This  appeal  has  been
         brought against an EEA decision. Akrich, as can be  seen  from  the
         discussion set out above  (although  not  fully  reflected  in  the
         paragraph relied upon by  Mr  Karnik)  makes  a  clear  distinction
         between appeals brought under  the  Regulations  and  the  separate
         requirements that can be imposed by a Member State to  control  the
         lawful entry  and  stay  in  its  country.  Such  controls  as  are
         implemented must not contravene the rights of freedom  of  movement
         and reference to Article 8 is referenced in Akrich in that regard -
         see paragraphs 58 and 59. Akrich makes  plain  that  where  a  non-
         Member State spouse was  not  lawfully  in  the  Member  State  the
         absence of a right under Article 10 of  1612/68  does  not  have  a
         dissuasive effect (see paragraphs 53 and 54).

     28. The EEA Regulations give effect to the framework of EU law.  If  an
         application  is  refused  and  the  appeal  dismissed  under   that
         framework, that is the end  of  the  matter.  Community  law  gives
         effect to the concept of family unity. If there  is  no  family  as
         defined in the EU framework, or there is some other reason  that  a
         person falls out with the  framework,  then  the  application  (and
         appeal) fails. That a person may be able to request an exercise  of
         discretion, including consideration of the proportionality  of  the
         decision, is not provided for in the Regulations. Member States may
         exercise their discretion differently, that is a matter for them.

     29. As paragraph 57 of Akrich makes clear, there would be an  abuse  of
         the facilities afforded by  Community  Law  if  Community  Law  was
         invoked in order to circumvent the provisions relating to the entry
         and stay of non-Member State nationals; this is  further  explained
         in paragraph 59. This does not mean that consideration of Article 8
         is an integral part of the consideration of  whether  a  person  is
         entitled to a residence permit. Whether a person is entitled  to  a
         residence permit is determined by whether that person meets the  EU
         law criteria. That there may be circumstances in  which  Article  8
         becomes a relevant consideration is not, as submitted by Mr Karnik,
         during the course of an appeal against the refusal of  the  permit,
         but during consideration of  an  application  for  leave  to  enter
         within the statutory framework where, if a person does not meet the
         criteria in the Immigration Rules, consideration should be given to
         whether the individual's circumstances are such as  to  render  the
         decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance  or  leave   to   remain   a
         disproportionate interference in the right to family life.

     30. In the case of Mr Akrich, who was subject to a  deportation  order,
         the ECJ drew attention to the considerations that should  be  taken
         into account in determining if, separate from the  Regulations,  an
         application for the revocation of the  deportation  order  and  any
         subsequent grant of leave to remain/entry clearance, they were such
         as to enable such a grant to be made.  That  is  not  consideration
         under the  EEA  regulations  appeal  but  consideration  under  the
         statutory framework implemented by the Member State, in  that  case
         the UK.

     31. The appeal structure of the Regulations does not refer to article 8
         ECHR or the wide discretion afforded  to  Member  States  to  grant
         permission to enter or remain in their country under their national
         framework. The Regulations  set  out  the  framework  within  which
         family unity is to  be  maintained  without  interfering  with  the
         freedom of movement of  the  national  of  the  Member  State.  The
         Regulations do not provide rights but deliver what the EU framework
         requires to deliver to enable freedom of movement. The  Regulations
         do not set out to consider Article 8 but to give effect to EU law.

     32. There is no obligation in the structure of an appeal under the  EEA
         regulations  to  undertake  an  article   8   consideration;   such
         consideration only arises if there  has  been  an  application  for
         leave to enter the UK  in  accordance  with  the  UK's  immigration
         framework.

     33. Mr Karnik submitted that the covering letter with  the  application
         for the residence permit constituted an application  under  Article
         8. I stated at the hearing before me that I  would  not  take  that
         letter into account in deciding whether there had been an Article 8
         application because it was not before the First-tier Tribunal judge
         either in the respondent's bundle or the bundle of documents relied
         upon by the appellant. For completeness however, I have  considered
         whether there was an application. The letter said:

             "Now that they have complied with the adoption process both in
             the United Kingdom and in Nigeria, we would urge you  also  to
             consider Section 55 of the Nationality Immigration and  Asylum
             Act 2002 (sic). It is in the best interest of  this  child  to
             join his adoptive parents in the United Kingdom. Article 8  is
             therefore engaged on this occasion."

     34. I assume the writer of the letter meant  s55  Borders,  Citizenship
         and Immigration Act 2009. The statutory duty  under  s55  does  not
         apply  to  children  overseas  although  UK  Border  staff  working
         overseas must adhere to the spirit of the  duty,  as  laid  out  in
         "Every Child Matters,  Change  for  Children"  guidance  issued  in
         November 2009. Other than fleeting reference to s55, the thrust  of
         the submissions before me on behalf of the appellant were  that  in
         accordance with Article 8 the child should have been granted  entry
         clearance; there was no submission that somehow there  was  a  duty
         under s55 which amounted to an application.

     35. Mr Karnik also referred  to  the  review  by  the  Entry  Clearance
         Manager, which referred to Article 8, as indicative of there having
         been an Article 8 application. That was, in the words of  Sales  LJ
         in Amirteymour, "irrelevant  surplusage".  Furthermore,  the  Entry
         Clearance Manager conducted a review; he did not make an appealable
         decision.

     36. There is a misconception as  to  what  constitutes  an  application
         under Article 8. First there has to  be  an  application  which  is
         framed  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  in  the  Rules.   That
         application is treated by the Secretary of State as a human  rights
         claim and is considered in the context of the Immigration Rules and
         statutory framework. If the applicant does not meet the criteria in
         the Rules (which are generally congruent with the UK's  obligations
         under the  ECHR),  consideration  is  given  to  whether  there  is
         something other than 'fits' within the  Rules  which  would  render
         refusal of the application disproportionate. In  this  case,  there
         has been no application, paid or  unpaid,  framed  as  meeting  the
         requirements of the Rules - it is accepted that the appellant  does
         not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.  A  statement
         that Article 8 "is engaged" is not and cannot be considered  to  be
         an application for leave to enter, even  if  Article  8  could  'be
         engaged' for an individual who  is  not  within  the  jurisdiction.
         There cannot be a statutory appeal arising out of such a statement.
         For a statutory appeal to ensue, there would have to be a waiver by
         the Secretary of State that, contrary to the statutory scheme, that
         phrase amounted to an application for  leave  to  enter.  That  has
         plainly not happened.

     37. In conclusion therefore, there  was  no  human  rights  appeal  and
         Article 8 could not be considered within the appeal  brought  under
         the EEA regulations. There was no material error of law  by  First-
         tier Tribunal judge Davies in refusing to hear argument on  Article
         8.

    Ground 2: SM (Algeria) had not been brought to  the  attention  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and had it been the outcome  would  or  could  have
    been materially different.

     38. SM (Algeria) was handed down on 14th February 2018. The  First-tier
         Tribunal hearing took  place  on  23rd  March  2018.  SM  (Algeria)
         considered two questions, one of which concerned the position of  a
         third  country  national  who  had  been  placed   in   the   legal
         guardianship of European Union Citizens under the Islamic  "kefala"
         system in her own country. The First-tier Tribunal  held  that  the
         child did  not  qualify  under  the  Immigration  Rules  for  entry
         clearance and nor did she fall within the  definitions  of  'family
         member', 'extended family  member'  or  adopted  child  of  an  EEA
         national under the EEA Regulations 2006. The Upper Tribunal  upheld
         the First-tier Tribunal decision that she did not fall  within  the
         definition of 'family member' but allowed the appeal on  the  basis
         that she came within the definition 'extended  family  member'  and
         returned the case to the SSHD for her to  exercise  the  discretion
         conferred upon her by regulation 12(2) of the 2006 EEA Regulations.
         The Court of Appeal allowed the ECO's  appeal  and  (correctly  the
         Supreme Court held) observed that the real question was not whether
         the child fell within  either  definition  but  rather  was  she  a
         'direct descendant' within the definition  of  'family  member'  in
         article 2.2(c)[4] of the Directive or whether she fell within  'any
         other family members...who in the country from which they have come
         are dependents or members of the household  of  the  Union  Citizen
         having the primary right of residence' -article  3.2(a)[5]  of  the
         Directive.

     39. The Supreme Court held that there was little  doubt  but  that  the
         child would fall within article 3.2(a) of the directive is she does
         not fall within article 2.2(c). her discretion. In paragraphs 17 to
         21 the Supreme Court set out the various considerations to be taken
         into account including the necessity for an  extensive  examination
         of the personal circumstances,  that  UK  legislation  relating  to
         foreign adoptions is clearly relevant but not  determinative,  that
         s55 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 was relevant  and
         that decision makers would have to bear in mind that the purpose of
         the Directive is to simplify  and  strengthen  the  right  of  free
         movement and residence for all Union Citizens.

     40. The Supreme Court said

             28.  We therefore cannot consider it  acte  clair  that  [this
             child] is not to be regarded as a  direct  descendant  of  her
             guardians for the purpose of article 2.2(c). ... We  are  also
             concerned that an  automatic  right  of  entry  for  "kefalah"
             children might lead to some of  them  being  placed  in  homes
             which domestically would have been rejected as unsuitable.

             ...

             33.  Thus, the Court refers the following three  questions  to
             the Court of Justice of the European Union for  a  preliminary
             ruling:

                  (1)  Is a child who is in the permanent legal guardianship
                  of a Union citizen or citizens, under  "kefalah"  or  some
                  equivalent arrangement provided for in the law of  his  or
                  her country of origin, a "direct  descendant"  within  the
                  meaning of article 2.2(c) of Directive 2004/38?

                  (2)  Can other provisions in the Directive, in  particular
                  articles 27 and 35, be interpreted so as to deny entry  to
                  such children if they are  the  victims  of  exploitation,
                  abuse or trafficking or are at risk of such?

                  (3)   Is  a  member  state  entitled  to  inquire,  before
                  recognising  a  child  who  is  not   the   consanguineous
                  descendant of the EEA  national  as  a  direct  descendant
                  under article 2.2(c),  into  whether  the  procedures  for
                  placing the child in the guardianship or custody  of  that
                  EEA national was such as to give sufficient  consideration
                  to the best interests of that child?

     41.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not  consider  whether  the
         appellant  could  be  treated  as  an   extended   family   member,
         restricting the consideration to whether the appellant was a direct
         descendant.

     42. In the light of SM (Algeria), the First-tier Tribunal  judge  erred
         in law in failing to consider if  the  appellant  was  an  extended
         family member.

     43. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge in so far
         as the appeal was dismissed under the EEA Regulation appeal.

    Remaking of the appeal under the Regulations.

     44. Mr Karnik submitted that in line with SM,  the  appellant  can  and
         should be treated as a family member and recognised as such  by  EU
         law. He submits that the evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         was such that it was sufficient to meet the requirements of EU  law
         to be found to be a direct descendant for the  purpose  of  article
         2.2(c). In [25] of SM, Lady Hale draws attention  to  the  contrast
         between article 2.2(b) which  relates  the  concept  of  registered
         partnership to the laws of the  Member  State  and  article  2.2(c)
         which does not reference  national  laws,  indicating  that  direct
         descendant should be given a "uniform interpretation throughout the
         Union".

     45. It is correct that in this appeal, in contrast to that in SM, there
         is evidence if suitability. Nevertheless, the  appellant  does  not
         meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules[6]  and  cannot
         therefore be said to meet the member States national  requirements.
         This is the very question that has been referred to the ECY by  the
         Supreme Court. I cannot find that the evidence before  me  is  such
         that the appellant meets the requirements of article 2.2(c).

     46. On  the  other  hand,  the  appellant  does,  it  seems,  meet  the
         requirements of article 3.2(a) in the light of SM. The  application
         for a family residence permit in this appeal  was  made  under  the
         2016 EEA Regulations. There is no appeal to the Tribunal  where  an
         extended family member permit is refused, as pointed out by Mr Tan.
         Although the vires of the Regulations is the subject of  challenge,
         the position at present is that  there  is  no  appeal.   I  cannot
         therefore allow this appeal on the  basis  that  this  child  falls
         within article 3.2(a) and that the Secretary of State is  therefore
         required  to  undertake  "an  extensive  investigation"  into   the
         personal circumstances of the appellant.

     47. I remake the appeal and dismiss it.

    Conclusions

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law under the EEA Regulations.

    I set aside set aside the decision made under the EEA Regulations.

    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it

    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

    I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
