For the Appellant:     Mr Kumar, Counsel instructed by UK Migration Lawyers
Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr A. McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Nepal born on the 23rd April  1982.   He
    appeals with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    (Judge French) to dismiss his appeal against refusal of a 'human rights
    claim' viz an application for entry clearance to settle in  the  UK  as
    the adult child of a former Gurkha soldier and his surviving widow.


 2. The Appellant's relevant personal history is as  follows.   His  father
    was Nil Bhadur Thapa (born on the 30th October 1935). Mr  Thapa  served
    in the Gurkha regiment between 1953 and  1968.   He  died  on  the  9th
    January 2000, having never been granted settlement in this country. The
    Appellant's mother is Man Maya Thapa, who has lived  in  the  UK  since
    2014.  She was given entry clearance under what were  then  termed  the
    'discretionary arrangements for the widows of Gurkhas'.   On  the  25th
    November 2019 the Appellant made an application for entry clearance  to
    join his mother.

 3. His application was refused on the 14th June 2020. The  letter,  surely
    incomprehensible to anyone but its author, essentially made two points.
    First, that the Appellant could not qualify under any of  the  relevant
    rules or published discretionary policies that pertain to Gurkha family
    members, nor under the standard 'adult dependent  relative'  paragraphs
    of the rules. Second, that his application could not succeed on Article
    8 grounds because he had not established that he shared a 'family life'
    with his mother.   Although he claimed to be financially dependent upon
    her this was not a dependency of necessity.   The Appellant  is  a  fit
    and healthy adult who has a number of siblings living in Nepal to  whom
    he could turn  for  support  if  support  was  required.   He  had  not
    therefore demonstrated that he had  "more  than  the  normal  emotional
    ties" to his mother.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal sets out in its decision the respective written
    arguments advanced in the ECO's decision and the grounds of appeal:  it
    is in this section that the Tribunal mentions legal authority  such  as
    Kugathas v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003]  ECWA  Civ
    31 and Ghising and Others [2013]  UKUT  00567  (IAC).   The  Tribunal's
    conclusions are set out in the final two paragraphs of its decision. At
    paragraph  12  it  notes  the  submissions  made  by  the   Appellant's
    representative in respect of the historic injustice perpetrated against
    soldiers of the Gurkha regiment but directs itself that this "is not in
    itself decisive". The Tribunal continues:

         "It seems to me that  it  is  critical  to  determine  whether  the
         Appellant is genuinely dependent on the sponsor for  his  essential
         needs. It is  my  view  that  there  were  inconsistencies  in  the
         evidence such as  to  undermine  credibility.  There  has  been  no
         explanation of why the Appellant was unable to find work in  Nepal.
         He said that he had applied for work but did not say how many times
         or what the jobs were. Specifically there was no explanation of why
         he was any  more  vulnerable  and  in  need  of  support  than  his
         siblings..."


    The decision here embarks on an analysis of Mrs Thapa's finances before
    continuing:


         "Aside from these issues I have also took into account the  Article
         8 argument about right to family  life.  However  the  sponsor  had
         chosen to come to the UK on her own in 2014. I was referred to  the
         sponsor's passport, but the only visa  stamps  which  were  legible
         showed there had been visits back to  Nepal  in  January  2017  and
         September 2018. This did  not  demonstrate  that  the  sponsor  and
         Appellant were a close family unit".


 5. Finding no "compelling reasons"  to  allow  the  appeal,  the  Tribunal
    dismissed it.


 6. The First-tier Tribunal granted the Appellant permission to  appeal  to
    this Tribunal on the 10th March 2021. In doing so  First-tier  Tribunal
    Neville helpfully distilled the discursive and  repetitive  grounds  as
    follows:

              i) It was  arguable  that  the  Judge  failed  to  make  clear
                 findings,  or  offer  adequate  reasoning,  in  respect  of
                 whether there was a family life between mother and son.  It
                 is  arguable  that  the  Tribunal  misdirected  itself   in
                 requiring a financial dependency of necessity;


             ii)  The  Judge  failed  to  make  clear  findings  on,  or  to
                 appropriately  direct  himself  to,  the  relevant  caselaw
                 addressing the  particular  situation  of,  and  historical
                 injustice faced by, Gurkha families.


    Discussion and Findings


 7. The parties before me agreed I need not embark on a lengthy analysis of
    cases such as Kugathas and Ghising,  since  the  Court  of  Appeal  has
    already done it for me, in the case of Jitendra Rai v  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, New Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320.  Jitendra Rai  was,  like  this
    Appellant, the adult son of a Gurkha veteran who sought entry clearance
    to the UK inter alia on the grounds that had his father  been  able  to
    settle in this country upon his retirement from service, as it  is  now
    agreed by parliament that he should have been, then the Appellant,  and
    indeed his siblings, would have been born British.  The Upper  Tribunal
    had dismissed Rai's case on grounds remarkably similar to the reasoning
    employed by Judge French in the present  case.  It  was  reasoned  that
    Rai's parents had elected to come to this country and leave their adult
    children in Nepal, it could not be said that any  financial  dependency
    was borne of necessity since there was no reasonable explanation as  to
    why Rai was not employed, and nor could it be said  that  this  was  an
    obvious nullification of Article 8 family life, since Rai had  siblings
    who remained in Nepal with him.


 8. Reviewing the uncontroversial legal principles,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    held as follows.  First,  that  Kugathas  has  been  too  restrictively
    applied in the past and ought to now be read in line with  developments
    from the domestic and Strasbourg courts:  Ghising (family life -adults-
    Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 160 (IAC)  and  Guring  [2013]  1  WLR  2546
    applied.    The question of whether an individual enjoys family life is
    ultimately one of fact. The Court cited  with  approval  the  following
    passage from Sir Stanley Burnton's judgment in  Singh  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Cic 630:

         24. I do not think that the judgments to which I have referred lead
         to any difficulty in determining the correct approach to Article  8
         in cases involving adult children. In the case of  adults,  in  the
         context of immigration  control,  there  is  no  legal  or  factual
         presumption as to the existence or absence of family life  for  the
         purposes of Article 8.  I  point  out  that  the  approach  of  the
         European   Commission   for   Human   Rights   cited    approvingly
         in Kugathas did not include any requirement of exceptionality. It
         all depends on the facts. The love and affection between  an  adult
         and his parents or siblings will not of itself justify a finding of
         a family life. There has to be something more. A young adult living
         with his parents or siblings will normally have a family life to be
         respected under Article 8. A child enjoying a family life with  his
         parents does not suddenly cease to have a family life  at  midnight
         as he turns 18 years of age. On  the  other  hand,  a  young  adult
         living independently of his parents may well not have a family life
         for the purposes of Article 8.

 9. There is then no presumption against family life with an  adult  child,
    nor is there any requirement of exceptionality.  The question is simply
    whether, on the facts, a family life exists.


10. In this case the Appellant and his mother both gave  evidence  to   the
    effect that she has always been close to him, and  that  he  has  never
    left the family home to start an independent life.  So it was that once
    they had saved sufficient money to make an application for a  child  to
    join her, it was him that  was  the  obvious  choice.  The  Appellant's
    mother averred that she misses her son a lot and maintains regular,  if
    not daily, contact with him. She has visited him three times since  she
    came to live in the UK. As an elderly  widow  she  is  concerned  about
    facing the end of her life on her own and would like the support of the
    Appellant. None of that evidence appears to feature in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's analysis about whether there is  a  family  life  here.  The
    analysis instead focuses almost  exclusively  on  whether  there  is  a
    financial dependency, which as  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  repeatedly
    stressed, is not the test.    I am therefore satisfied that the  First-
    tier Tribunal erred in its approach to whether there was a family life.
     It should have conducted a holistic assessment, and treated  financial
    dependency simply as one facet of whether  that  family  life  existed.
    Such a dependency can only serve as  evidence  of  a  family  life:  it
    cannot create it. Nor was there any requirement of  exceptionality,  as
    the Tribunal appeared to understand the test to be.

11. It follows that I need not address  any  further  grounds,  although  I
    recognise that Mr Kumar is right when he says that the Tribunal appears
    to have misunderstood the financial evidence, incorrectly  assuming  as
    it did that Mrs Thapa was paying her own rent when in fact that expense
    is met by housing benefit.   I would add that the Tribunal's  focus  on
    the choices made by this family - of mother to migrate to the  UK,  and
    of son to remain her financial  dependent  -  are  arguably  irrelevant
    considerations  in  light  of  the  decision  in  Rai  which  at  [�43]
    identifies the "perhaps crucial" point as  being  the  fact  that  this
    Gurkha and his family would have all applied  to  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom together had they been able to do so at the relevant time.



    Decision and Directions


12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for error of law.


13. The decision in the appeal is to be remade by a Judge of the First-tier
