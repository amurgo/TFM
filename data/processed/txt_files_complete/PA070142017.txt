                    Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officers


                                DETERMINATION


 1. This determination is to be read with:

      i)  The  respondent's  decision  dated  27  June  2017,  refusing  the
         appellant's claim.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, filed
         on 25 July 2017.

    iii)  The  decision  of  FtT  Judge  Handley,  dismissing  the   appeal,
         promulgated on 6 October 2017.

     iv) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal  filed  with  the  FtT  on  20
         October 2017.

      v) The decision of Designated Judge Woodcraft, dated 7 December  2017,
         refusing permission.

     vi) The grounds of  appeal  (substantially  the  same)  stated  in  the
         application for permission filed with the UT on 23 January 2018.

    vii) The decision of  UT  Judge  Finch  dated  5  March  2018,  granting
         permission.

   viii) The respondent's rule 24 response, dated  28  March  2018,  to  the
         grant of permission.

 2. The substance of my decision dated 5 and issued on 11 July on error  of
    law is repeated herein.

 3. The decision of the respondent, although dated 27 June 2017, was issued
    under cover of a letter dated 13 July and stamped as  received  by  the
    appellant's solicitors on 18 July.  The appeal was filed  on  25  July.
    On 26 July the FtT issued notice of a pre-hearing review  on  9  and  a
    hearing 23 August.

 4. By letter faxed to the FtT on  15  August  the  appellant's  solicitors
    sought an adjournment because an expert report had been  instructed  on
    risk to  the  appellant  in  Sri  Lanka  arising  from  his  sur  place
    activities in the UK.

 5. The FtT refused that application on 16 August, stating, "We see no need
    for an expert witness on the issue stated in the correspondence".

 6. The application for adjournment was renewed at the hearing.   Paragraph
    20 of the judge's decision notes the previous refusal, and goes on, "In
    the absence of any other information or evidence I did not consider  it
    was necessary or appropriate to adjourn the hearing for  production  of
    an expert report".

 7. In addition to the authority cited in the grounds, Mr MacKay founded on
    Nwaigwe [2014] UKUT 00418 for the test, "Was there any  deprivation  of
    the right to a fair hearing?"  He referred to paragraphs 32, 33 and  37
    of the decision where the judge refers  to  "little  or  no  evidence",
    "little evidence", and "no credible reports" of the risk  alleged.   He
    submitted that  these  comments  went  precisely  to  the  matters  the
    appellant sought to cover, if granted an adjournment.   He said that on
    the above timetable, there had been no delay in identifying an  expert,
    applying for legal aid, and instructing a report.  The expert had  been
    advised not to proceed further once it became clear  his  report  could
    not be produced  to  the  FtT.   Instructions  had  been  renewed  once
    permission to appeal to the  UT  was  granted.   The  report  had  been
    received  only  yesterday.    It   contained   material   which   might
    significantly have advanced the appellant's case.

 8. Mr Mullen did not adopt the line of the FtT.  He did not argue that  an
    expert could add nothing useful.  He pointed to the  longer  timescale,
    in that this is a repeat application by  way  of  a  fresh  claim,  the
    appellant having been in the UK since 2004.  He said that issues in the
    refusal letter could not have come as a surprise; the time  to  advance
    materials had been with the fresh submissions; and  that  overall,  the
    appellant had ample opportunity to prepare.

 9. Mr Mackay in reply said that materials advanced with fresh  submissions
    had been thought at the time likely to  be  sufficient,  and  that  the
    appellant could not reasonably have justified the expense of an  expert
    until he had the refusal decision.

10. I indicated that the decision of the FtT would be set aside.

11. Mr Mullen made a reasonable  case  of  the  appellant  having  time  to
    prepare, but cases evolve, and there was also  force  in  the  counter-
    argument that the report was sought promptly  and  at  the  appropriate
    stage.

12. More significantly, the adequacy of time to prepare was not the  reason
    given by the FtT for refusing to adjourn.  It gave no  reason  for  the
    view that an expert report could be of no value.  That matter  was  not
    so obvious as to speak for itself.  The expert is one  acknowledged  in
    the country guidance on related matters.   The  report  was  sought  on
    developing issues, precisely those on which the FtT went on  to  decide
    against the appellant for lack of evidence.

13. The appellant's case in fairness ought not to have been decided without
    enabling him to produce a  relevant  report  which  had  been  promptly
    instructed.

14. The case falls within the presumption of remaking by the  UT.   It  was
    agreed that a further hearing should be fixed  for  that  purpose,  and
    that no further oral evidence was likely to be offered.  The  case  was
    then listed for 28 September.

15. Mr Mackay presented the case for the appellant by reference to evidence
    of his website, "Sri Lankan Muslims against the Sri  Lankan  Government
    and Sinhalese Racist Groups", at pp 89 - 123 of his  FtT  Inventory  of
    Productions III; the report of Dr Chris Smith, senior  research  fellow
    at the Institute of Commonwealth studies, London, dated  4  July  2018;
    and further evidence submitted with an application dated  25  September
    under rule 15 (2A), to  show  the  appellant's  activities  on  various
    social media, YouTube  analytics  to  show  the  number  of  views  and
    comments made thereon.

16. Mr Govan did not oppose admission of the further evidence.

17. The respondent's decision accepted that the appellant was  an  internet
    blogger, writing and publishing articles about problems facing  Muslims
    in Sri Lanka, and that he had acted as a steward at protests in the UK.
     However, it was not accepted that his content  was  widely  viewed  or
    that it "would have gained the attention of the Sri Lankan  authorities
    from the millions of blogs on the internet", or  would  do  so  on  his
    return (paragraphs 20, 28 and 50).

18. The website materials are highly critical of the Sri Lankan government.
     The appellant's name is prominent on title pages and  as  the  author.
    The issue is not whether they are such as to give rise to  a  risk  but
    whether there is a risk of the authorities making the connection to the
    appellant on his return.  Any such connection would bring the appellant
    within the categories explained in GJ and others Sri  Lanka  CG  [2013]
    UKUT 00319 - in particular 7 (b),  as  a  journalist  or  human  rights
    activist critical of the government's human rights record.

19. The appellant has not shown show that he might be  on  a  "stop"  list,
    based on a court order or warrant, but the evidence might  support  the
    possibility of being on a "watch" list.

20. There are some weak points in the appellant's case.

21. The appellant exhibits total numbers of views of his website -  513,400
    - and of YouTube views, over 50% of which are from Sri Lanka - 4,954 in
    the last 90 days.  The numbers sound quite  large,  but  they  are  not
    shown to be more than minute fractions of  internet  activity  of  this
    type.

22. The appellant's  website  and  social  media  accounts  are  under  his
    control.  He could delete them.  If he has been acting in bad faith, he
    may be expected to do so, whenever that is in his interest.

23. The appellant entered the UK on his Sri  Lankan  passport.   He  claims
    since to have lost it, and it may well have expired.  However, there is
    nothing to suggest that he could not obtain an up-to-date passport.  He
    has not shown that his case should be considered on  the  basis  of  an
    enforced return.  Refusal to return voluntarily, where that  course  is
    available, does not qualify for protection: see Macdonald's Immigration
    Law and Practice, 9th ed., ï¿½12.24 and 12.28, and cases there cited.

24. The expert report says as a generality at the opening of paragraph 34:

         "Irrespective of whether the  appellant  returns  under  escort  or
         independently, he will be questioned at the airport in his capacity
         of a failed asylum seeker."

25. That is imprecise.  Going into further detail later in  the  paragraph,
    the following is found:

         "UK returnees escorted or presented by the airline are  immediately
         identifiable as returnees to the DIE [Department of Immigration and
         Emigration]. Unescorted returnees travelling on emergency passports
         issued by the Sri  Lankan  High  Commissioner  in  London  will  be
         questioned by DIE to ascertain  if  they  are  returnees.  However,
         unescorted returnees travelling on their original passports will in
         all probability not even be questioned by  DIE  unless  they  bring
         themselves to the immigration officers' attention in some other way
         e.g.  presenting  a  document  containing  forged  or  unauthorised
         endorsements."

26. There is nothing in the report to show that  the  appellant  could  not
    obtain his own passport and return unnoticed, as far as mode of  travel
    is concerned.

27. Mr Mackay suggested that even if the appellant applied routinely to the
    Sri Lankan authorities for an up-to-date passport, a file was likely to
    be opened and enquiries made, particularly as he would be seen to  have
    spent a long time in the UK without a lawful basis.  That  would  be  a
    matter of inference rather than direct evidence of such a practice.

28. Mr Mackay argued that the appellant's activities were such that he  was
    already likely to have been entered on the authorities' list of persons
    of interest; and that the authorities had available to  them  manifests
    with the names of persons returning routinely, and would be  likely  to
    scrutinise these also.

29. The country guidance and the evidence,  including  the  expert  report,
    shows  that  the  authorities'  approach  is  based  on   sophisticated
    intelligence.  It was accepted that there is no  specific  evidence  of
    how they monitor the internet or that anyone has been put at risk  only
    because of monitoring.  Mr  Govan  submitted  that  the  expert  report
    surmised without evidence about monitoring.   However,  the  nature  of
    intelligence and surveillance is such  that  organisations  hide  their
    methods.  The inferences drawn by the expert  are  reasonable.   As  he
    says at paragraph 17:

         "It is not clear how effective or efficient Sri Lankan intelligence
         is in relation to the diaspora, but the received  wisdom  considers
         that it has improved. If the Sri Lankan authorities have identified
         the appellant, this will provide an additional reason as to why his
         name will be on the electronic database and therefore on one of the
         lists."

30. Towards the end of submissions, by agreement, the appellant's name  was
    entered into the Google search engine by the presenting  officer.   The
    UT confirmed  the  outcome.   Although  the  appellant's  name  is  not
    obviously an uncommon one, it is the  first  result.   That  takes  the
    search not immediately to  his  website  but  to  the  well-known  site
    LinkedIn.  One further click leads to his website.

31. The appellant's activities may well  have  been  undertaken  cynically,
    given past findings about his case.  At best, they may have  had  mixed
    motives.  The only difference this makes goes to the extent to which he
    might be deemed likely to hide his traces.  The ability to delete would
    be a matter for an expert in  information  technology.   There  was  no
    evidence of that nature, and it was for the appellant to make his case.
     However,  the  appellant's  activities  are  not  all  within  private
    accounts such as Facebook, and I take it as reasonably likely that some
    internet trail, such as an archived website, would remain.

32. The respondent's decision is based on the appellant's activities  being
    so insignificant and obscure as to avoid attention; but the  ease  with
    which they can be found on the internet under  his  name  answers  that
    point.

33. There is a possibility that based on either (a) general surveillance of
    the internet or (b) scrutiny of appellant's name when he applies for  a
    passport  or  appears  on  a  passenger   list,   his   anti-government
    publications may come to the attention  of  the  authorities.   Only  a
    routine enquiry through a search engine would be required, not  methods
    unique to the security services.  The appellant might be able to return
    routinely and unnoticed; but there is a strong  enough  possibility  of
    identification to place him at risk.

34. The decision of the FtT has been set aside.  The appeal, as  originally
    brought to the FtT, is allowed.

35. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
