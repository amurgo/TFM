Without an  individualised  grant  of  leave  to  enter  by  an  immigration
officer, or express extension of the initial probationary  period  of  leave
to enter, a foreign spouse is extremely unlikely to  be  able  to  meet  the
requirements  for  indefinite  leave  to   remain   imposed   by   paragraph
287(a)(i)(a).

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and is married to  the  sponsor.
    She arrived in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2003 in  possession  of
    valid entry clearance as a spouse, issued  on  19  September  2003  and
    valid for a  year.   On  her  arrival,  under  the  provisions  of  the
    Immigration (Leave to Enter and  Remain)  Order  2000  (SI  1161/2000),
    arts. 3, 4(3)(b) and 5 that took effect as  leave  to  enter  until  19
    September 2004, with a condition prohibiting employment.  That was  the
    automatic effect of the visa under the Order: no one  appears  to  have
    given any other thought as to the period  for  which  leave  should  be
    granted.  On 12 August 2004 the appellant applied for indefinite  leave
    to remain as the spouse of a person present and settled in  the  United
    Kingdom.  That application was refused on 25 October 2004.  The  reason
    for the refusal was initially that the appellant had failed to  provide
    information requested by the Home Office.  That  reason  was  withdrawn
    when it became clear that the appellant had indeed replied to the  Home
    Office letter.  The application was then considered  substantively  and
    the refusal was maintained on the ground that the  Secretary  of  State
    was not satisfied that the marriage was subsisting and that the parties
    had been or intended living together permanently as husband  and  wife.
    The appellant appealed against the refusal, and the matter came  before
    an Immigration Judge on 18 April 2006.  The appellant  was  represented
    by Mr Hussain, as she was before us; there was no appearance by  or  on
    behalf of the respondent.  The Immigration Judge  heard  evidence  from
    the appellant, the sponsor and the sponsor's father and found  that  he
    was satisfied that the appellant met  the  requirements  of  the  Rules
    mentioned by the Secretary of  State  as  supporting  his  decision  to
    maintain the refusal.  He thus allowed the appeal.   The  Secretary  of
    State  then  sought  reconsideration  of  that  determination,   on   a
    completely different  ground.   It  is  set  out  in  the  grounds  for
    reconsideration as follows:

        "The Immigration Judge had allowed the appeal on the basis that the
        appellant meets the requirements  of  Rule  287  of  HC  395.   The
        Immigration Judge has  listed  the  requirements  of  Rule  287  at
        paragraph 3.  The Immigration Judge has noted that  Rule  287(i)(a)
        requires that the appellant was admitted for or given an  extension
        of stay for one year.


        However the Immigration Judge has misdirected himself in law  since
        Rule 289(i)(a) requires that the applicant  was  admitted  for,  or
        given an extension of  stay  for  two  years.   The  appellant  was
        admitted for one year  (see  attached  Explanatory  Statement)  and
        therefore did not meet the requirements of the Rule.


        The decision is fatally flawed and unsustainable."

 2. Reconsideration was ordered, the Senior  Immigration  Judge  who  dealt
    with the application noting that the change from one year to two  years
    had been by an amendment in Cm 6339, taking effect on 1  October  2004.
    Thus the matter comes before us.

 3. Unfortunately for the  appellant,  it  is  well  established  that  the
    respondent is entitled to raise at  a  late  stage  an  issue  of  non-
    compliance with an element  of  the  Immigration  Rules  that  has  not
    previously been mentioned.  That is  because  the  Notice  of  Refusal,
    Explanatory Statement and accompanying correspondence are  not  in  the
    nature of pleadings; and an Immigration Judge has  power  to  allow  an
    appeal in  these  circumstances  only  if  he  is  satisfied  that  the
    appellant did or does at the relevant date meet all the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules.  What is remarkable in the present case is  that
    the respondent appears to have erred again, because, contrary  to  what
    is stated in the grounds, the appellant was not admitted for one  year.
    She was admitted for a period beginning on 21 October 2003  and  ending
    on 19 September 2004 - a little less than eleven months in total.

 4. The appellant's  difficulties  in  this  appeal  appear  to  us  to  be
    characteristic of difficulties  arising  from  frequent  and  piecemeal
    changes in immigration law during the last  few  years.   In  order  to
    understand what has happened, we need to set out some elements  of  the
    history of immigration control generally, and of immigration control as
    it relates to those seeking settlement as spouses.  In what follows, we
    ignore asylum and human rights issues: where we make general statements
    they are intended to apply only to elective immigration law.   We  also
    ignore the different situation of EU nationals and  those  exempt  from
    immigration control: our  references  to  those  who  are  not  British
    citizens is to be taken those  who  are  not  British  citizens  or  EU
    nationals, and are subject to immigration control.

Before the 1999 Act

 5. Under s3 of the Immigration Act 1971, a person who  is  not  a  British
    citizen requires leave to enter the United Kingdom.  The power to  give
    or refuse leave to enter the United  Kingdom  is  exercisable  only  by
    immigration officers (s4(1)), and those who needed it therefore  sought
    it from an immigration officer on arrival in the  United  Kingdom,  and
    were granted  or  refused  leave  to  enter,  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules applicable to their situation.

 6. A person intending to come to the United Kingdom could make application
    at a British post abroad for entry clearance, and would do so in any of
    three situations.  First, nationals of the countries listed in Appendix
    1 to the Immigration  Rules  require  entry  clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom whatever the purpose of their proposed entry.  In  their  case,
    entry clearance, if granted, takes the form of a visa.  A  national  of
    one of the countries mentioned is a "visa national", and  will  not  be
    granted leave to enter the United Kingdom unless he is in possession of
    a visa on his arrival.  Secondly, the Immigration Rules  require  those
    intending to enter the United Kingdom  for  certain  purposes  to  have
    entry clearance whether or not they are visa nationals.  In particular,
    entry clearance is required for those intending to settle in the United
    Kingdom as spouses or dependent family  members,  but  the  requirement
    extends  also  to   various   other   categories,   including   working
    holidaymakers, domestic servants and ministers of religion.  Thirdly, a
    person not a visa national proposing to seek entry for a purpose  other
    than one for which entry clearance is required  could  and  can  simply
    present himself at a port and seek leave to enter.  But, if he prefers,
    he too can apply for entry clearance in order to save  the  possibility
    of a wasted journey.  Entry  clearance  is  in  all  cases  granted  or
    refused on the same basis under  the  Immigration  Rules  as  leave  to
    enter.

 7. A person who arrived in the United Kingdom with current entry clearance
    which had not been obtained by deceit or rendered invalid by  a  change
    of circumstances was, broadly speaking, entitled to be granted leave to
    enter: that is to say, the entry clearance  gave  a  sort  of  informal
    presumption that the immigration officer would  act  on  it  and  grant
    leave to enter.  Indeed a person arriving in the  United  Kingdom  with
    current entry clearance, who is refused leave to enter, had and  has  a
    right of appeal and can remain in the United Kingdom  to  exercise  it.
    The dichotomy between entry clearance and leave to enter was,  however,
    maintained.  Despite the fact that the same Immigration Rules  applied,
    and despite the effective presumption arising from the grant  of  entry
    clearance, on arrival in the United Kingdom a  person  who  was  not  a
    British citizen required the act of the immigration officer in granting
    him leave to enter before he could enter lawfully.  The  possession  of
    entry clearance gave of itself no right to enter  the  United  Kingdom.
    On his arrival in the  United  Kingdom,  he  would  present  his  entry
    clearance to the immigration officer, who would (normally after  asking
    a few questions) decide whether it was appropriate to  grant  leave  to
    enter and, if so, would grant leave to enter for an appropriate period,
    beginning, evidently, on the date of the grant.

After the 1999 Act

 8. This system was radically altered by the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    1999, which inserted a new s3A into the 1971 Act.  The relevant part of
    this section for present purposes is sub-section (3):

      "(3)  The Secretary of State may  by  order  provide  that,  in  such
             circumstances as may be prescribed -
            (a)  an entry visa, or
            (b)  such other form of entry clearance as may be prescribed,
            is to have effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom."


     Such an order has to be made by Statutory Instrument.  The  Instrument
    in question is that to which we have already referred, the  Immigration
    (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 (SI 1161/2000), which came  into
    force on 28 April 2000.  Under that Order, an entry clearance which (a)
    specifies the purpose for which the holder wishes to enter  the  United
    Kingdom and (b) is endorsed either with the conditions to which  it  is
    subject or an indication that it is to take effect as indefinite  leave
    to enter, is to have effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom.  That
    is the sense of Article 3  of  the  Order.   Article  4  of  the  Order
    prescribes the terms of the leave (for all purposes other than multiple-
    entry visit visas and dual-entry visit visas granted  pursuant  to  the
    ADS Agreement with China) as follows:


      "4(3) ... it shall have effect as leave to enter the  United  Kingdom
             on one occasion during its period of validity; and  on  arrival
             in the United Kingdom the  holder  shall  be  treated  for  the
             purposes of the Immigration Acts as having been granted  before
             arrival leave to enter the United Kingdom:
            (a)  in the case of an entry clearance which is endorsed with a
                  statement that it is to have a effect as indefinite  leave
                 to enter the United Kingdom, for an indefinite period;
            (b)  in the case of an entry clearance which is  endorsed  with
                 conditions,  for  a  limited  period,  being   the   period
                 beginning on the date on which the holder  arrives  in  the
                 United Kingdom and ending on the  date  of  expiry  of  the
                 entry clearance."

 9.  It appears that in conjunction with the  coming  into  force  of  this
    Order, Entry Clearance Officers were directed to change their  practice
    in issuing entry clearance.  Whereas previously entry clearances of all
    sorts had been valid for six months, enabling a  holder  who  travelled
    within that period of time to apply on arrival in  the  United  Kingdom
    for leave to enter and be granted it for an appropriate period, for the
    future the practice was to be that the entry clearance itself would  be
    valid for an appropriate period, depending on  the  purpose  for  which
    entry was being sought.  This  change,  however,  did  not  remove  the
    problem, as we shall see.

Leave to enter as a spouse

10. Entry for the purpose of settlement as a spouse has,  at  all  relevant
    times required prior entry clearance.  On arrival in the United Kingdom
    the holder of the entry clearance would seek leave to enter, which  was
    normally granted for one year in the first instance.  The  purpose  was
    for the Secretary of State and indeed the  parties  to  ensure  that  a
    trans-national marriage was indeed viable and that the parties intended
    to live together permanently in the United Kingdom  as  man  and  wife,
    having been given an opportunity to do  so.   During  that  first  year
    (while the person who was not a British national had current leave), if
    all went well, an application would be made  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain.  Paragraph 282 of HC 395 provides that a person  seeking  leave
    to enter the United Kingdom as the  spouse  of  a  person  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom "may be admitted for  an  initial  period
    not  exceeding  12  months"  provided  everything  else  is  in  order.
    Paragraph 287 required, as one of the conditions for  indefinite  leave
    to remain as the spouse, that "the applicant was admitted to the United
    Kingdom or given an extension of stay for a period of 12 months and has
    completed a period of 12 months as the spouse of a person  present  and
    settled here".

11. Those provisions  have  both  been  subject  to  subsequent  amendment,
    because it is now necessary to provide for certain other categories  of
    person.  They have also both been amended to change the period  of  one
    year to that of two years.  Paragraph 282 was amended by HC 538,  which
    took effect on 1 April 2003.  The amendment to paragraph 287 was by  Cm
    6339, which took effect on  1  October  2004.   The  relevant  part  of
    paragraph 287 is now as follows:

      "287(a)...(i)(a) The applicant was admitted to the United Kingdom  or
                    given an extension of stay for a period of two years  in
                    accordance with paragraphs 281 to 286 of these Rules and
                    has completed a period of two years as the spouse  of  a
                    person present and settled in the United Kingdom".

12. Paragraph 289 has, throughout, remained the same:

      "298. Indefinite leave to remain for the spouse of a  person  present
             and settled in the United Kingdom  is  to  be  refused  if  the
             Secretary  of  State  is  not  satisfied  that  each   of   the
             requirements of paragraph 287 is met."







The effect of the 2000 Order

13. In the present appeal the  grounds  for  reconsideration  rely  on  the
    change from one year to two years as  the  probationary  period.   They
    argue that, as the date of the decision was after 1 October  2004,  the
    appellant did not meet the requirements of the Rules  as  she  had  not
    been in the United Kingdom for two years as spouse.  We shall return to
    that difficulty shortly.  It is, however, important to  note  that  the
    present structure of the Immigration Rules, and the practice  in  their
    application, creates difficulties for all non-British  citizen  spouses
    who seek indefinite leave to remain.  That is because of the effect  of
    the  2000  Order.   Entry  clearance  is  granted,  abroad,   for   the
    appropriate period.  Following the change of the probationary period to
    two years, that will normally mean that the  entry  clearance  will  be
    valid for two years.  It is, however, in practical terms impossible for
    a person issued with such an entry clearance to obtain leave  to  enter
    the United Kingdom for a period of two years by using it.   Because  of
    the 2000 Order, it appears that immigration officers no longer give any
    independent thought to the question of the period for  which  leave  to
    enter should be granted by them in their discretion.  On  the  holder's
    arrival in the United Kingdom, the only leave to enter available to the
    holder is therefore that which the Order gives him.  But there is bound
    to be some interval between the grant of the entry  clearance  and  the
    arrival in the United Kingdom; indeed the interval is likely to  be  of
    at least a few days because a person would normally want to  make  sure
    of having entry clearance before paying for travel tickets.   Any  such
    delay eats into the period  of  leave  to  enter,  because  under  art.
    4(3)(b) of the Order, the period of leave to enter will not be a period
    of the same length as that the entry clearance was valid, but will be a
    period beginning on arrival and ending with the validity of  the  entry
    clearance.

14. So a spouse who arrives with entry clearance valid for two  years  will
    in practice necessarily be granted leave to enter for a period of  less
    than two years.  Unless such a person seeks  and  actually  obtains  an
    extension of leave, he or she cannot meet the requirements of paragraph
    287.  That is a matter of some importance, because of the provisions of
    paragraph 289.  A person who has  not  been  "admitted  to  the  United
    Kingdom or given an extension of stay for a  period  of  two  years  in
    accordance with paragraphs 281 to 286"  is  to  be  refused  indefinite
    leave to remain.  The fact that such a person,  by  making  an  in-time
    application, has leave extended by  s3C  of  the  1971  Act,  does  not
    assist, because that of itself does not affect the terms  of  admission
    or of being "given" any extension of stay.

15. Even a person who does arrive in the United Kingdom within a  few  days
    of the issue of entry clearance and waits until the last  possible  day
    for his application for  indefinite  leave  to  remain,  is  making  an
    application outside the Rules.  He cannot succeed under paragraph  287,
    because his leave was of less than two years.  He must  first  make  an
    application for extension for the few days that he needs  in  order  to
    make up the period of two years, and only when he has been  granted  it
    can he properly make an application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain
    under paragraph 287.  It is thus vital that such a  person  makes  this
    first (extension) application and does so specifically.   He  may  find
    himself in some difficulties if he makes an application in such a  form
    that it may be taken as an application for indefinite leave to  remain,
    because that is an application that cannot succeed under the Rules.

16. Even the seeking of an extension may not be without its difficulties in
    all cases.  An extension of leave for a person seeking leave to  remain
    as a spouse is governed by paragraph 284-286 of HC 395.  In its present
    form, paragraph 284(i) requires that:

        "The applicant has limited leave to enter or remain in  the  United
        Kingdom which was given in accordance with any of the provisions of
        these Rules other than whereas as a result of that leave  he  would
        not have been in the United Kingdom beyond six months from the date
        on which he was admitted to the United Kingdom on this occasion  in
        accordance with these  Rules,  unless  the  leave  in  question  is
        limited leave to enter as a fianc�".

17. In the usual case that will no doubt cause no difficulty.  But  it  may
    be that, for some good reason, the applicant's arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom has been delayed and that, as a result, when he arrives in  the
    United Kingdom his entry clearance has less  than  six  months  of  its
    validity left.  In those circumstances, under the terms of  the  Order,
    he will have less than six months leave to enter.  But he  is  entering
    as a spouse, not a fianc�, and  so  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 284.

18. We have set out these points because we do not  think  that  they  have
    previously received any serious attention.  There is a mismatch between
    the terms of the Immigration Rules and the effect of the Order.  Mr Raj
    confirmed to us that when entry clearance as a spouse is granted, it is
    granted for the appropriate probationary period, that  is  to  say  two
    years.  He acknowledged that this would normally mean  that,  when  the
    entry clearance took effect as leave to enter, the leave to enter would
    be for less than two years.  He told us  that  spouses  caught  in  the
    transition between the one year requirement and  two  year  requirement
    had received invitations to apply for  further  leave  to  bring  their
    leave up to two years.  He was, however, unable to confirm  that  there
    are any particular arrangements in place for  those  who  need  a  very
    short extension in order  to  be  able  to  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 287.

What is to be done?

19. It is not for us to cure these difficulties.  One possible way  forward
    would be for immigration officers to  grant  leave  of  an  appropriate
    period in spouse cases, rather than relying  on  the  slightly  shorter
    period effected by the Order.  Another possibility would be for  spouse
    entry clearances to be valid for, say, 27 months, and, when issued,  to
    be accompanied by a warning of the consequence of not using them within
    the first three months of their validity.  What is important  from  the
    point of view of the appeals process, is  that  paragraph  287(i)(a)(i)
    remains in force, and that a person who cannot show that he already has
    two years leave to enter  granted  to  him  (by  way  of  extension  or
    otherwise as a spouse) simply cannot meet the requirements of paragraph
    287, and is bound to be refused.  We are afraid that this may apply  to
    a  very  large  number  of  appeals  by  spouses  against  refusals  of
    indefinite leave to remain.

The present case

20. In the present case the position is that the appellant could  not  meet
    the requirements of paragraph 287 as it was at the date of the decision
    in her case.  It required her to have had two years leave to enter, and
    she had had only eleven months.  For this reason, which is  the  reason
    argued in the grounds for reconsideration although the calculations are
    wrong, we are satisfied that the Immigration Judge erred in law and  we
    shall substitute a determination  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal.
    The appellant cannot in law claim  a  right  to  have  her  application
    decided under earlier Rules (R v IAT ex parte Nathwani [1979-80] Imm AR
    9 QBD) but, with only eleven months' leave she did  not  meet  the  old
    requirements of the Rules either.

21. That is not the last problem with this appeal.  As we  have  said,  the
    appellant was granted an entry clearance  valid  for  one  year  on  19
    September 2003.  Mr Raj told us that one of  the  consequences  of  the
    change to paragraph 282 (which relates to  the  granting  of  leave  to
    enter for the probationary period for a spouse) on  1  April  2003  was
    that Entry Clearance Officers had been instructed, from that  date,  to
    issue spouse entry clearances valid for two years.  We have not seen  a
    copy of any such direction, but there seems little reason to doubt what
    Mr Raj said.  Although no doubt if the  appellant  had  made  a  proper
    analysis of the relevant law and the Immigration Rules and the  various
    changes in them she could have understood what to do, the grant of only
    a year (rather than two  years)  in  her  case  has  had  a  number  of
    unfortunate consequences.

22. The first is that it failed to draw to her attention the need  to  have
    two years leave to remain before making an application  for  indefinite
    leave.  The second is that her application was indeed made when she had
    been in the United Kingdom for a much shorter period of  time  than  is
    now envisaged under the Rules with their two-year probationary  period.
    Bearing in mind the points as to the subsistence of the marriage and so
    on which were taken against her by the Secretary of State, it may  well
    be that she was prejudiced by being led into making an  application  at
    that time.

23. The terms of the Secretary of State's grounds  for  reconsideration  in
    this case lead us to suppose that the particular point about the length
    of her leave, which we have dealt with above, might not have been taken
    against her and, at the proper time, she might not have  been  able  to
    satisfy the Secretary of State that she met the other  requirements  of
    the Rules without difficulty.  We do not know.   What  we  do  know  is
    that, having been granted entry clearance for the wrong period,  having
    been refused on the grounds of non-compliance when  she  had  complied,
    having then been refused on grounds on which the Immigration Judge  was
    in her favour, and then having lost  her  appeal  again  on  a  further
    ground of which the Secretary of State appears himself not to have been
    precisely aware, she may  well  feel  a  sense  of  injustice.   As  we
    indicated at the hearing, and as we understood Mr  Raj  to  agree,  the
    appellant needs a  remedy.   In  our  view  it  is  most  appropriately
    provided by the Secretary of State treating any application made by the
    appellant for indefinite leave to remain as a spouse, made within three
    months of the date of this determination, as being an application by  a
    person who meets the requirements of paragraph 287(a)(i)(a).

24. For the reasons we have set out earlier in this determination, however,
    we find that the Immigration Judge made a material error of law and  we
    substitute a decision dismissing this appeal.
