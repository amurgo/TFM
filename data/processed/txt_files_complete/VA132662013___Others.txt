                            DECISION AND REASONS



 1. These are linked appeals against the decisions of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge O'Garro promulgated  on  18  July  2014  dismissing  the  appeals
    against  the  Respondent's  decisions  dated  21  May  2013  to  refuse
    applications for entry clearance as visitors.

Background

 2. The Appellants are nationals of Bangladesh. Their personal details  are
    a matter of record on file. They are all members of  the  same  family:
    two parents and two adult children. Together they made applications for
    entry clearance as  visitors  in  order  to  see  three  further  adult
    children of the family, who are each  present  in  the  UK  as  British
    citizens, and their respective families.  In  their  visa  applications
    they indicated that a visit of approximately 4-6 weeks was intended. Of
    the family members in the UK, Ms Shayla  Pervin  was  advanced  as  the
    sponsor.

 3. The applications were refused for reasons set out in similarly  drafted
    respective Notices of Immigration Decision  dated  21  May  2013,  with
    reference to paragraphs 41(i), (ii), (vi) and (vii) of the  Immigration
    Rules. The First Appellant, the father  of  the  family,  was  said  to
    support the  other  Appellants.  Essentially  the  Respondent  was  not
    satisfied in respect of the First Appellant's  claimed  employment  and
    financial  circumstances.  Moreover  the  Respondent  noted   that   no
    documents in respect of the sponsor's circumstances had  been  received
    with the applications. In all of the circumstances the  Respondent  was
    not satisfied as to the family's circumstances in  Bangladesh,  and  in
    consequence was not satisfied that they were genuine visitors; nor  was
    the Respondent satisfied that the Appellants would  be  maintained  and
    accommodated in the UK adequately without recourse to public funds,  or
    that they could meet the cost of the return or onward journey.

 4. The Appellants appealed to the IAC.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the appeals for reasons set out
    in her Determination.

 6. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which was granted by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Simpson on 31 October 2014.

Consideration

 7. In  her  determination  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  set  out  the
    background to the appeal  and  the  issues  raised  by  the  Respondent
    (paragraphs  1-4),  summarised  the  Appellants'  grounds   of   appeal
    (paragraphs 5-6), and summarised the evidence heard  from  the  sponsor
    (paragraph 7-14). The Judge then directed  herself  to  the  applicable
    Immigration Rules (paragraph 15), and to the  burden  and  standard  of
    proof (paragraph 16, and reiterated at paragraph  32).  Thereafter  the
    First-tier Tribunal's  Determination  sets  out  the  Judge's  findings
    before stating her conclusion (paragraphs 17-34).

 8. Essentially, the First-tier Tribunal Judge reached the same conclusions
    as the  Respondent  -  and  indeed  did  so  for  similar,  though  not
    identical, reasons. With  reference  in  particular  to  the  sponsor's
    circumstances the Judge concluded that she was not satisfied  that  the
    Appellants would be  adequately  maintained  and  accommodated  without
    recourse to public funds (paragraph 25).  As  regards  the  Appellants'
    circumstances the Judge found that the First Appellant  had  not  dealt
    adequately with the valid concerns raised by the Respondent (paragraphs
    27 -28).

 9. Whilst it is to be acknowledged that there  is  no  specific  threshold
    requirements in respect of an applicant's income under paragraph 41  of
    the Immigration Rules, the particular circumstances of an  applicant  -
    including economic activity and financial  circumstances  -  may  be  a
    relevant  consideration  in  evaluating  his  intentions   within   the
    framework of the requirements of the Immigration Rules. Doubtless,  the
    Judge had this in my in identifying that  the  matters  raised  by  the
    Respondent were "valid concerns" (paragraph 27).

10. Those concerns were articulated in the Notice of  Immigration  Decision
    in the following way:

   "You stated that you are self-employed with  M/S  Abdul  Hye  Fish  Farm
         since 2005 earning BDT 100,000 (approximately �826...)  per  month.
         However you do not provide satisfactory evidence of your income, or
         your personal, economic and financial circumstances in  Bangladesh.
         You have submitted a Trade Licence as evidence  of  your  business.
         Trade Licences are obtained upon  payment  of  a  registration  fee
         without the need to demonstrate that the business exists or that it
         is  a  genuinely  financially  viable  business.  Whilst  you  have
         submitted land deeds, these do not show that you receive any income
         from this land. You have also submitted money  receipts  but  these
         are self-serving and in isolation do not confirm that  your  income
         is as claim. In addition, whilst you have submitted an  income  tax
         certificate, this does not state what tax you have actually paid to
         demonstrate that your income is truly as claimed by you. It is  not
         clear why you would provide an income tax certificate stating  that
         you have paid taxes, yet not stating how much actual tax  has  been
         paid and on what annual income, and this leads  me  to  doubt  that
         your income is as claimed. You claim to have run your business  for
         8 years therefore I would expect to see evidence of  actual  income
         tax payments for the last year at  the  very  least,  and  I  would
         expect to see a lot more documentation for  a  genuinely  operating
         business. I am not satisfied therefore that  you  are  employed  as
         claim, or that you receive the income as claimed."

And:

   "You have submitted a letter from Bangladesh Krishi  Bank  stating  that
         you have an account with them and  you  have  submitted  a  Deposit
         Receipt dated 24/03/13 which states that you have  deposited  funds
         of BDT 10 lakh (approximately �8264).  As  these  funds  have  been
         deposited in the month leading to your entry clearance application,
         I cannot discount the possibility that they have been deposited  to
         inaccurately inflate  your  financial  circumstances  to  aid  this
         application. In any case, you have not  provided  any  evidence  or
         statements as to the origins or history of these funds and as such,
         I am not satisfied that they are genuinely  available  to  you  for
         your exclusive use, or that they represent an  accurate  reflection
         of your current financial circumstances and commitments."

11. As noted above the Judge found that "the first appellant has not  dealt
    adequately or at all, in his grounds of appeal and in  the  documentary
    evidence he has submitted regarding the concerns  raised  by  the  ECO"
    (paragraph 28). In respect of the "large deposit recently  credited  to
    the first appellant's bank account" the Judge noted the First Appellant
    explanation that the money represented a loan that he  had  made  to  a
    relative which had been repaid (and also had regard to  the  supporting
    evidence submitted by the Appellants in this regard  -  paragraph  30),
    but observed "it is of note that no up to date bank statement has  been
    submitted with the appeal documents or for  the  appeal  hearing  which
    would have shown that this money has remained in the first  appellant's
    bank account since it has been credited to the bank account".

12. It is pleaded on behalf of the  Appellants  that  the  Judge  erred  in
    having regard to the absence of post-decision bank statements, as  this
    ran contrary to the requirement that the Judge should only consider the
    appeal on the basis of the facts  that  pertain  at  the  date  of  the
    Respondent's decisions.

13. I do not accept that any such error is made out. Whilst of course, this
    being an entry clearance appeal, it is to be acknowledged that pursuant
    to section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  the
    Tribunal may consider only the circumstances appertaining at  the  time
    of the decision, post-decision evidence is nonetheless admissible in so
    far as it relates  to  the  circumstances  at  the  date  of  decision.
    Accordingly evidence that the First Appellant continued to  retain  the
    funds that had been deposited in his bank account that gave rise to the
    Respondent's concerns, would have been admissible to support the  claim
    that the money said to be available to the First Appellant at the  date
    of the Respondent's decisions was genuinely his own funds.  It  follows
    that the Judge did not contravene the jurisdiction imposed pursuant  to
    section 85A by making reference to materials post-dating  the  decision
    that  might  have  assisted  the  Appellants   in   establishing   that
    circumstances were as they claimed at the date of decision.

14. I have also given consideration to the criticisms that have  been  made
    of the Judge's rejection of the affidavit evidence of the  relative  to
    whom it was claimed that monies had been loaned. It is plainly the case
    that the Judge did not disregard this affidavit  evidence:  rather  she
    took it into account in her overall assessment of the circumstances  of
    the "large deposit". I accept that there is something unsatisfactory in
    the use of the phrase "self serving" in the context  of  an  affidavit.
    Nonetheless I am not satisfied that the mere use of this phrase, on the
    particular facts of this case, renders the Judge's decision in some way
    in error of law. In this context I bear in mind that the unsatisfactory
    nature of the deposit in the bank account was but  one  aspect  of  the
    unsatisfactory nature of the  presentation  of  the  First  Appellant's
    general financial circumstances. Looking at the matter 'in the  round',
    I am not persuaded that there was any material error in the  evaluation
    of the deposit in the bank account bearing in mind not just the failure
    to provide any independent supporting evidence (e.g. by way of  further
    bank statements) but also the Judge's conclusions  in  respect  of  the
    First Appellant's failure otherwise adequately or at all to address the
    concerns of the Respondent.

15. As regards the Judge's finding that the First Appellant had  not  dealt
    adequately, or at all, with the other concerns raised by the Respondent
    I find that there is nothing objectionable to the Judge's  observations
    in respect of the Grounds of Appeal: there is nothing in those  Grounds
    that advances the Appellants' cases any further or otherwise makes  any
    proper attempt to engage with the  Respondent's  concerns.  Essentially
    the Grounds before the First-tier Tribunal assert  that  the  documents
    submitted with the application were adequate: necessarily that  is  not
    to address the particular concerns which, in my judgement, it was  open
    to the Judge to characterise as  being  "valid  concerns".  Nor  is  it
    apparent that any new or different  materials  were  submitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal to  address  those  concerns:  the  documents  that
    appear at pages 4-25 of the Appellants' bundle on the face  of  it  are
    the same documents that were submitted with the application. Mr Mustafa
    acknowledged that he was not able to suggest that they were in any  way
    different, or otherwise advanced the Appellants' cases any further.

16. In respect of the sponsor's circumstances Mr Whitwell acknowledged that
    the Judge appears  to  have  disregarded  the  fact  that  the  sponsor
    submitted a personal bank statement at the appeal hearing covering  the
    period 25 January 2013 to 19 March 2013. To that extent the  Judge  was
    in error at paragraph 24 in stating "I have seen no bank statement".

17. However, in my judgement,  such  a  mistake  does  not  invalidate  the
    Judge's observations at paragraph 23 as to the  dearth  of  documentary
    evidence relating to income and savings in circumstances where  it  was
    clear to the Appellants, the  sponsor,  and  the  representatives  that
    there was an issue in respect of the sponsor's ability to maintain  and
    accommodate the Appellants, and that such issue had arisen  because  of
    the absence of supporting evidence with the application - in particular
     "payslips, employment letter, P60" (as well as bank statements), which
    had not been seen by the Respondent.

18. In this context it is to be noted that the bank statement only covers a
    two month period some two months prior to  the  Respondent's  decision.
    Further, for the main part, the credits to the account are from  public
    funds,  be  that  by  way  of  carer's  allowance,  disability   living
    allowance, child tax credits, or housing benefit.  Moreover,  a  single
    bank statement is not in and of itself inevitably complete evidence  of
    the financial circumstances of a household. For example: it was said at
    the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal that the  sponsor's  husband
    works as a chef in Northern Ireland; whilst  there  are  some  deposits
    paid in Newtonabbey, there is no supporting evidence of  the  husband's
    employment or income level. There was not otherwise any attempt  before
    the First-tier Tribunal to set out household income and expenditure  by
    way of a suitable table or chart, and no supporting evidence beyond the
    bank statement identifying relevant  income  and  outgoings.  Moreover,
    when I enquired as to whether or not the  sponsor  was  in  receipt  of
    Child Benefit I was told that this  was  paid  into  a  different  bank
    account: this in itself demonstrates that the bank account presented to
    the First-tier Tribunal was in no way reliable as a reflecting  all  of
    the circumstances of the household's finances.

19.  Accordingly,  I  find  that  the  Judge  was  essentially  correct  in
    identifying that inadequate materials had been provided to  answer  the
    concerns in respect of the sponsor's financial circumstances raised  by
    the Respondent. The Judge's oversight in respect of the bank  statement
    was not, in my judgement, ultimately material to this outcome.

20. Although it is pleaded in the Grounds in support of the application for
    permission to appeal that the Judge was in error  in  failing  to  give
    individual consideration to whether each  of  the  Second,  Third,  and
    Fourth Appellants had sufficient ties  to  Bangladesh  such  that  they
    would be more likely than not to leave the  UK  at  the  end  of  their
    visit, such matters cannot avail the Appellants in circumstances  where
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  unimpugnably   concluded   that   the
    maintenance and accommodation requirements of the Rules were  not  met,
    and nor was the requirement in respect of  meeting  the  costs  of  the
    onward or return journey.

21. Accordingly in the circumstances I find no material error in the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge's assessment that the Appellants had not  addressed
    pertinent  legitimate  concerns  of  the  Respondent.  Accordingly  the
    decisions of the First-tier Tribunal stand.

Notice of Decision

22. The decisions of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  contained  no  material
    errors of law and stand.

23. The appeals are each dismissed.
