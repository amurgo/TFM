For the Appellant:     Mr. M Butt, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr. G Jack, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 20 September 1986.  He
    has been granted permission to appeal the determination of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Birrell dismissing his appeal against the decision of
    the respondent dated 4 October 2013 to refuse to vary his leave to
    remain in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.  The refusal
    was on the basis that the requirements of paragraph 245ZX ï¿½ of HC395
    were not met by reference to Appendix A Paragraph 118(b)(ii) (1)-(3).
    The appellant had claimed 30 points for his Confirmation of Acceptance
    for Studies (CAS).  However, the respondent was not satisfied that the
    appellant was either competent in the English Language at a minimum of
    Level B2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for languages
    (CEFR).

2.   The appellant claimed in his grounds of appeal against the
    respondent's decision that in March 2011 he was awarded an Edexcel
    Level 7, BTEC Advanced Professional Diploma in Management Studies by
    Whitechapel College.  He also stated that he was previously refused
    (13.2.2012) an application for leave as a Tier 4 Student on the basis
    that he was not exempt from the English Lange requirement.  A First-
    tier Tribunal Judge accepted that Edexcel Level 7 was equivalent to the
    United Kingdom Bachelor's Degree.

3.   First-tier Judge Birrell found that the fact that a previous First-
    tier Judge has accepted that this was equivalent to a bachelor's degree
    did not bind him.  It was for the appellant to satisfy him that his
    qualification was deemed by UK NARIC to meet or exceed the recognised
    standard of a Bachelor's Degree.  The appellant had provided no
    evidence from NARIC to demonstrate equivalence accordingly he must meet
    the language requirement.

4.   The judge said he was satisfied that the appellant could not meet the
    language requirement set out in Appendix O because he had provided 3
    certificates, one of which dated 22 February 2012 related only to
    Speaking whereas the certificates must show the scores meeting the
    grade for two components on one occasion.  The judge was therefore
    satisfied that the appellant did not meet the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules.

5.   Mr. Butt relied on the grounds of appeal against the judge's decision.
     It was submitted at paragraph 8 that the appellant's Edexcel Level &
    BTEC Diploma was equivalent to a UK degree level course and this is
    clearly mentioned in the CAS.  Mr. Butt was unable to show me where in
    the CAS this was mentioned.

6.   Mr. Jack relied on Appendix B 7.10 (i) which requires the appellant's
    academic qualification to be deemed by UK NARIC to meet the recognised
    standard of a Bachelor's degree, and confirmation from UK NARIC that
    the degree was taught or researched in English to Level C1 of the CEFR.

7.   In the absence of recognition and confirmation by UK NARIC that his
    academic qualification meets the recognised standard of a Bachelor's
    degree and that it was taught or reached in English to Level C1 of the
    CEFR, I find that the judge's decision was perfectly sustainable and
    disclosed no error of law.

8.   The judge's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.
