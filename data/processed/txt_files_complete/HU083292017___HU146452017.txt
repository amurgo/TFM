                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    R. L. Walker, promulgated on 25th May 2018, following a hearing on 18th
    May 2018 at Hatton Cross.  In the determination,  the  judge  dismissed
    the appeal of the Appellants,  whereupon  the  Appellants  subsequently
    applied for, and were  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are both citizens of Ghana.  They  are  siblings.   They
    are aged 11 and 16  years  respectively.   They  appealed  against  the
    decision of the Respondent dated 3rd July 2017 and  18th  October  2017
    refusing their applications for entry clearance to  the  UK  as  minors
    under paragraph 297 of HC 395.

The Appellants' Claims

 3. The essence of the Appellants' claims are that they wish to join  their
    sponsoring aunt, [GQ], because she has had  "sole  responsibility"  for
    them since 2014.  The Appellants had different mothers but had the same
    father.  They had been abandoned by their parents in 2003.   They  were
    looked after by their grandfather [QQ], until he died on  12th  October
    2014.  The Sponsor, [GQ], is the daughter of [QQ], and she is the half-
    sister of [AQ], who is the father of both of the Appellants.  After the
    death of the grandfather, the Sponsor made arrangements for them to  be
    looked after by a family friend who stayed with them from 2014 to 2016.
     Unfortunately he could no longer continue to do so.  They  then  moved
    in to live with their great-uncle, [NQ].  This was a temporary  measure
    because of his age and lack of accommodation.   The  Sponsor,  however,
    has been remitting funds to the Appellant since 2016 and has been fully
    responsible for them  since  that  date.   She  has  dealt  with  their
    respective schools and has arranged payment of their school  fees.   It
    is also said that the Sponsor obtained custody of  both  Appellants  in
    October 2016 and in 2017 took proceedings in order  to  formally  adopt
    them as children.  She says that she has developed a strong and genuine
    parental relationship with her nieces and believes their best interests
    are for them to live in the UK.  It is a feature of this case, however,
    that the Sponsor herself is in receipt of  public  funds,  whereby  she
    receives around �185 per week on state benefits, which  she  uses  both
    for herself and to provide remittances to the Appellants, her nieces.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge found that the Sponsor's claim that she has  been  exercising
    sole responsibility, was not proven.  This is because:

         "She has accepted that she has only been remitting  funds  to  them
         since the death of her father in 2014.  The evidence is limited  to
         remittances only since 2016.  There is  also  the  point  that  the
         Sponsor must have struggled to remit funds especially as she is  in
         long-term receipt of public funds in the UK.  This must  limit  her
         ability to remit funds" (see paragraph 19).

    The judge went on to say that the Appellant had given  evidence  before
    him that until the death of her father, the responsibility  financially
    for the children lay upon him.

 5. The judge went on to consider the question as to  whether  the  Sponsor
    had sole custody for the Appellants given the order  for  sole  custody
    dated 1st September 2016.  He observed that there was  an  application,
    an affidavit in support with annexures, and a  social  enquiry  report.
    However, the judge concluded that:

         "None of these documents have been provided.  There has  also  been
         produced two affidavits from [NQ]  dated  26  October  2017  and  2
         November 2017 agreeing to the adoption of  the  Appellants  by  the
         Sponsor.  These affidavits are post decision documents"  (paragraph
         21).

 6. The judge went on to say that the various documents  were  insufficient
    to show that there have been any formal custody, adoption  or  transfer
    of parental responsibilities to the Sponsor.  He went  on  to  conclude
    that, "as the relationship is a de facto one at best then there  is  no
    evidence, or indeed claim, that the  Appellants  have  lived  with  the
    Sponsor for the required period" (paragraph 22).

 7. The judge went on to consider that the Sponsor  had  provided  numerous
    documents relating to the benefit she was receiving:

         "But there has been nothing  to  show  that  the  Sponsor's  actual
         income can meet the income support equivalent.  If she is intending
         to support both Appellants then she is  going  to  need  more  than
         �199.20p and which is referred in the refusal for [M].  The Sponsor
         has confirmed she is unable to work so this would force her to rely
         upon public funds for whatever she and the Appellants  would  need"
         (paragraph 23).

 8. The judge held that there was no evidence to confirm the suitability of
    accommodation for both Appellants (paragraph  24).   Finally,  he  held
    that the Sponsor had only made three visits to Ghana since she came  to
    settle in the UK in  1991.   She  had  seen  the  Appellants  on  three
    occasions.  He concluded that "these highlight her limited  involvement
    with the lives of the Appellants" (paragraph 25).  Section  55  of  the
    BCIA 2009 did not demonstrate that the Appellants' best  interests  lay
    with living with the Sponsor in the UK.

 9. The appeals were dismissed.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that the judge conducted the appeal in
    a manner  that  was  procedurally  unfair.   There  was  no  Presenting
    Officer.  The Sponsor was the only person who attended the  hearing  on
    18th May 2018.  The judge had, at the outset of  his  consideration  of
    the appeal, stated that, "I have carefully considered  and  taken  into
    account all the documentation filed on behalf of  both  the  Appellants
    and the Respondent.  I have also considered the oral submissions of  Mr
    Coleman" (paragraph 16).

11. The grounds of challenge state that there appears to have been:

         "action by Mr Coleman for submitting an oral statement to the judge
         in the absence of the Appellants' representative  after  the  court
         hearing, for which they had failed to turn up and  the  judge  also
         accepting to consider those incorrect information  provided  by  Mr
         Coleman against the Appellants ..."

12. The grounds also state that Judge Walker  applied  the  incorrect  test
    when rejecting the evidence about  the  Sponsor's  remittances  on  the
    basis of the Sponsor's income, and that it appeared that  Mr  Coleman's
    "incorrect information" was also relied upon behind  the  back  of  the
    Sponsor who had attended the hearing.  The grounds further  state  that
    the judge was wrong  to  have  concluded  that  accommodation  was  not
    available for the Appellants because there had been  evidence  provided
    just shortly before the hearing that there was a two-bedroom flat which
    was occupied by the Sponsor alone, which would be available for the two
    Appellants.

13. Permission to appeal was granted on 24th July 2018 on  the  basis  that
    the judge was wrong in concluding that adequate accommodation  was  not
    available for  the  two  Appellants  because  such  evidence  had  been
    produced shortly before the hearing.   However,  what  gave  particular
    concern to the Tribunal granting permission was the reference to a  "Mr
    Coleman".  Although it could be that this was  a  typographical  error,
    this could not be  assumed.   If  such  a  person  was  in  attendance,
    clarification should have been provided by the judge,  and  until  such
    time as any concerns could be dispelled, there was an arguable error of
    law here.

Submissions

14. At the hearing before me on 25th September 2018, Miss  [GQ],  appearing
    as the sponsoring aunt of the Appellants, at the outset submitted  that
    there was no-one in attendance at  the  hearing  by  the  name  of  "Mr
    Coleman".  The Home Office did not field  a  Presenting  Officer.   She
    herself was in attendance only as a layperson.  The judge  was  correct
    in stating that "the hearing was dealt  with  by  way  of  an  informal
    discussion" (paragraph 15).  For her part, Miss  Holmes,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent, at this stage stated  that  this  could  only
    have been a cut and paste job, whereby a reference to a Mr Coleman from
    a previous determination had found its  way  into  this  determination.
    Certainly, it was not the case that the Tribunal had received  evidence
    behind the back of the Sponsor, after the hearing had come to  an  end,
    as this was not the  practice  of  the  Respondent  authority  in  this
    jurisdiction.

15. I have to say that I am satisfied completely that the reference  to  Mr
    Coleman is in error.  The name has crept into the  determination  quite
    by accident.  It is, in any event, something that sits  unhappily  with
    the judge's observation in the preceding paragraph that,  "the  hearing
    was dealt with by way of an informal discussion" given that  there  was
    no Presenting Officer and that the judge himself had asked "the Sponsor
    numerous questions" (paragraph 15).  There is, accordingly, nothing  in
    this point.

16. Miss [GQ] went on  to  rely  upon  the  grounds  of  application.   She
    submitted that the judge was wrong to have concluded that the order for
    sole custody could not be taken at face value on the basis  that  "none
    of these documents have been provided" (paragraph 21),  when  reference
    was made to an application, an affidavit in support with annexures, and
    a social enquiry report.  She stated  that  all  these  documents  were
    indeed provided.  However, she agreed that the two affidavits from [NQ]
    of 26th October 2017 and of  2nd  November  2017,  which  read  to  the
    adoption of the Appellants by the  Sponsor,  were  indeed  postdecision
    documents.  Miss [GQ] went on to say that she could point  to  evidence
    that she had made financial remittances for the Appellants.   She  also
    had accommodation  available  now.   The  appeal  ought  to  have  been
    allowed.

17. For her part, Miss Holmes submitted that the judge had  given  detailed
    reasons from paragraphs 19 to 25, for  refusing  the  appeal.   Nothing
    that the Sponsor today stated  could  gainsay  that.   The  only  issue
    really was whether there was a Mr Coleman in attendance at the hearing,
    or had provided information after the hearing, but  this  was  not  the
    case, and once it is accepted that the reference was  in  error  to  Mr
    Coleman, the grounds of application did not merit consideration.

18. In reply, Miss [GQ] stated that as a lone parent she only needs to show
    �73.10 for the necessary income support equivalent.  The Respondent, in
    making the decision to refuse the Appellants,  had  used  �185  as  the
    required threshold.  However, her income was twice  what  was  required
    for the purposes of this application.  Their appeal should be  allowed.



No Error of Law

19. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.

20. First, it is plain that the reference to Mr Coleman is in  error.   The
    judge's statement that, "I have also considered the oral submissions of
    Mr Coleman" (paragraph 16) was by way of an accident.  If the judge had
    done so, in a manner unbeknown to Miss [GQ], the judge would  not  have
    included such a reference at paragraph 16.  It was plainly  a  mistake.
    As a mistake, it does not amount to a material error by any stretch  of
    the imagination.

21. Second, there is the question of  the  availability  of  accommodation.
    Whilst I accept that this evidence was available prior to  the  hearing
    commencing before Judge Walker on 18th May 2018,  the  reason  why  the
    Appellant really fails in succeeding in this appeal is that the Sponsor
    was  unable  to  demonstrate  that  she  had   been   exercising   sole
    responsibility for the Appellants (see paragraph 19).  The judge  found
    that, not only had the Sponsor been  remitting  funds  only  since  the
    death of her father in 2014,  but  the  evidence  of  remittances  only
    exists from 2016, and the Sponsor "must have struggled to  remit  funds
    especially as she is in long-term receipt of  public  benefits  in  the
    UK".

22. Even if it is the case  that  documents  such  as  an  application,  an
    affidavit in support with annexures, and a social enquiry report,  were
    provided at the time of the hearing, and overlooked by the  judge,  the
    fact remains that the two affidavits from [NQ] of 2017, which agree  to
    the adoption of the Appellants by the Sponsor, are affidavits which are
    postdecision documents.

23. Moreover, the judge was entitled, against the background of this  case,
    to conclude that  there  had  been  no  formal  custody,  adoption,  or
    transfer of parental responsibilities  to  the  Sponsor.   This  was  a
    conclusion that was open to him given that he had  earlier  also  found
    that, "in both of the birth certificates issued in 2015 the Appellants'
    respective mothers appear as informants" (paragraph 8(2)).

24. Furthermore, the judge correctly found that  the  Appellants  have  not
    lived with the Sponsor for the  required  period  needed  for  adoption
    purposes (paragraph 22).  More  to  the  point,  the  Sponsor's  actual
    income did not meet the income support  equivalent,  according  to  the
    judge (paragraph 23).

25. The Sponsor was intending to support both Appellants.  The judge  found
    that she was going to need more than �199.20, which is referred  to  in
    the refusal for [M].  She was unable to work and she  had  to  rely  on
    public funds in the long term (paragraph 23).  The judge was also right
    to conclude that the Sponsor  had  only  been  able  to  show  "limited
    involvement with the lives of the Appellants" (paragraph 25).

26. In these circumstances, the  conclusions  reached  by  the  judge  were
    entirely open to him, in a determination which is otherwise  clear  and
    well set out with respect to the issues  at  hand,  which  have  to  be
    determined.



Notice of Decision
