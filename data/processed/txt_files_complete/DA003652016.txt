                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr J Bryce, Advocate, instructed by Maguire,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. By a decision promulgated on 12 October 2016 First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    McGrade dismissed the appellant's appeal against deportation under  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 2. The respondent conceded that the decision discloses error of law.

 3. At �20 the Judge said, "The appellant was  convicted  of  a  number  of
    serious offences in Latvia and I consider he therefore poses a genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of
    society"; but previous convictions  do  not  in  themselves  constitute
    grounds for deportation.

 4. It was common ground that the decision should be set aside and remade.

 5. Although the FtT judge said at �2 that the burden was on the appellant,
    it was also common ground before us that the burden in a case  of  this
    type is on the respondent.

 6. The appellant is presently in Latvia, having eventually  been  deported
    on 10 July 2017.

 7. The appellant relied in previous proceedings on the protective  effects
    on the appellant of relationships with his partner and with  his  older
    brother.   Mr  Bryce  properly  advised   us   that   the   appellant's
    relationship with his partner has ended and that his brother  has  gone
    back to live in Latvia.  However, we note that  Judge  McGrade  in  any
    event had not accepted  that  the  relationships  had  any  significant
    protective influence.

 8. The record supplied by the respondent  shows  that  the  appellant  was
    convicted in Latvia on 4 occasions, from 28 September 2009  to  23  May
    2014.  He was released from his last sentence  on  22  September  2014.
    Read along with his statement, the last date of offending seems to have
    prior to or not long after his 18th birthday.

 9. The appellant was taken into immigration detention in the UK on 13 July
    2016, apparently as the eventual outcome of a random check some  months
    previously of his immigration status.

10. The appellant committed quite serious offences at  an  early  age,  but
    before being taken into detention, he lived and worked in  the  UK  for
    two years without any criminal offending or any cause for concern  over
    behaviour which might pose a threat to the interests of society.

11. We cannot say that the risk of re-offending is absent, but  the  recent
    history shows ability to refrain from offending and to  lead  a  normal
    working life, suggesting a low risk.

12. We conclude that the respondent has failed to discharge the  burden  of
    showing that the appellant poses a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat to the fundamental interests of society.

13. The decision of the FtT is set aside, and  the  following  decision  is
    substituted: the appeal, as originally brought to the FtT, is allowed.

14. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
