                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellants

1.   The Appellants are both citizens of Pakistan and are husband and  wife.
     The first Appellant, who I shall refer to as the Appellant,  was  born
    on 25th July 1985.  The second Appellant who I shall refer  to  as  Mrs
    Abbas was born on 26th August 1989.  They appeal against a decision  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hamilton sitting at  Hatton  Cross  on
    10th February 2013 who dismissed their appeals against decisions of the
    Respondent dated 30th May 2013.  Those decisions  were  to  refuse  the
    Appellant's application for further  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant and for Mrs Abbas' appeal as  his
    spouse and to remove both Appellants.

2.   The Appellant came to the United  Kingdom  in  July  2008  having  been
    granted a student visa valid until September 2010.  He was subsequently
    granted a post-study visa valid until 23rd July 2012 and then granted a
    Tier 1 (General) visa valid until 18th May 2013.   On  3rd  April  2013
    shortly before that last period of leave was due to expire  he  applied
    for further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, the  refusal
    of which has given rise to these proceedings.   Mrs  Abbas  joined  the
    Appellant in the UK in September 2011 and her  leave  was  extended  in
    line with his until the present refusal.

3.   In order to satisfy the number of points  required  under  the  points-
    based system the  Appellant  needed  to  be  awarded  80  points  under
    Appendix A (Attributes) but was only awarded 55 points.   20  of  those
    points (for previous earnings) were refused. The Appellant  claimed  to
    have previous earnings of  �35,316.31  and  as  evidence  of  that  the
    Appellant provided pay slips and bank statements showing  his  earnings
    from a company called Centrica.  However the Respondent took  the  view
    that the two pieces of evidence supplied did not corroborate each other
    as the net payments shown on the  pay  slips  were  not  clearly  shown
    entering the bank  account  in  the  statements.   The  Appellant  also
    claimed points for  self-employed  earnings  of  �7,498  from  Hallmark
    Forest Gate and �25,107 from work in the security industry and supplied
    an accountant's  letter  and  accounts.  The  Respondent  rejected  the
    accountant's letter because the  gross  and  net  earnings  from  self-
    employment were not stated on the letter and could not be  corroborated
    with the accounts provided.   As  the  Appellant's  earnings  were  not
    accepted he was not awarded 5 points for UK  experience.  He  was  thus
    refused 25 points and awarded only 55. He was  awarded  10  points  for
    English Language and 10 points for Maintenance (Funds).

The Appeal at First Instance

4.   The Appellant appealed  against  that  decision  arguing  that  he  had
    provided all supporting documents with his  initial  application.   The
    accountant's letter clearly mentioned that  the  total  taxable  income
    received by the Appellant was �35,316.31.  The grounds of  appeal  made
    no mention of any claim under Article 8 but at the first appeal hearing
    the Appellants raised an additional ground  of  appeal  that  requiring
    them to return to Pakistan would  breach  their  rights  and  those  of
    members of their family under Article 8 (right to respect  for  private
    and family life).  The hearing was  adjourned  for  the  Appellants  to
    provide evidence in support of this claim and  for  the  Respondent  to
    consider the new grounds of appeal.

5.   At  the  resumed  hearing  the  Judge  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    Appellant, his wife and his father.   The  Appellant  stated  that  the
    annual turnover from the family business, a card shop was about �70,000
    with a net profit after tax and expenses of  about  �7,000  to  �8,000.
    The Appellant also worked as a relief manager for  a  security  company
    working two days a week for 28 hours.  Last  year  he  had  made  about
    �25,000 gross.  The Appellant assisted his  father  by  taking  him  to
    hospital and  other  health  appointments.   The  Appellant  worked  in
    security for two days a week on Friday and Saturday but because of long
    hours it was more like three days.  The Appellant worked  in  the  shop
    four days a week.  The Appellant's wife also was there.

6.   The Appellant's father said that if the  Appellant  had  to  return  to
    Pakistan the card shop business would be finished.  It  had  not  being
    doing very well when he transferred it  but  the  Appellant  had  since
    built it up. He had transferred the card shop  into  the  name  of  the
    Appellant because he, the father, was no longer able to cope  with  it.
    No one else could run the business.  He  did  not  know  how  much  the
    business was worth.

7.   In his determination the Judge indicated  he  was  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant had  failed  to  provide  Barclays  Bank  statements  showing
    deposits that matched the amounts  on  his  pay  slips  from  Centrica.
    Citing Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2 the Judge held that  the  Respondent
    was under no obligation to ask the Appellant  to  provide  the  missing
    information in  order  to  try  to  rectify  the  deficiencies  in  the
    documents.  The Appellants could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    family and private life provisions in the Immigration Rules.

8.    The  Judge  considered  the  Article  8  claim  at  some  length  from
    paragraphs 24 to 29. Although it was accepted that the Appellant had  a
    family life in the United Kingdom with his parents, sisters and brother
    and had established a strong private  life  here,  the  decisions  were
    proportionate to the legitimate aim of immigration control.  Article  8
    could not be used as a device to circumvent  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  While their circumstances might not be optimal when
    the couple initially return  to  Pakistan,  the  Appellant  was  young,
    healthy, educated and able to work and had family contacts there.   The
    Appellants' departure would not inevitably lead to the  demise  of  the
    family business.  The Appellant was not running the  family  card  shop
    business by himself as claimed.  The security work  took  up  the  best
    part of three days in the week but there was  no  adequate  independent
    evidence  to  show  that  the  business  had  actually  been   formally
    transferred to the Appellant.  There was no evidence for  example  that
    the lease on  the  shop  had  been  transferred  into  his  name.   The
    Appellant could not have been working the long  hours  he  claimed  and
    also caring for his father.

9.   There was no evidence to show that  the  Appellant  was  paying  bills,
    council tax or other family expenses.  The Judge did not find that  the
    Appellant's parents  were  economically  dependent  on  the  Appellant.
    Families did not have an unfettered right to choose where  they  lived.
    Although the Appellant's wife was pregnant and the Judge had considered
    the best interests of her unborn child as a primary  consideration,  it
    would not be entitled to UK citizenship and would have no right to live
    in the UK.  Its needs would be met by living in whichever  country  its
    parents were.  The removal decision did not breach the family's  rights
    under Article 8.

The Onward Appeal

10.  The Appellants appealed against the Judge's decision taking issue  with
    a number of findings made by the Judge.  The Judge had  found  that  it
    was implausible that the Appellant would be able to support  the  whole
    family of seven adults on the annual  profit  from  the  card  shop  of
    �7,000.  The grounds pointed out that the Appellant had a second job as
    a security manager which when  taken  into  account  showed  the  total
    taxable income was in excess of �35,000.  It was thus a material  error
    of law for the Judge to contend that the income from the shop supported
    the whole family.

11.  At paragraph 38 of  the  determination  the  Judge  had  noted  regular
    payments into the Appellant's bank account from what he described as "a
    relative of the first Appellant with the identifying references mum and
    dad".  The Judge said no explanation was provided  for  these  payments
    and they seemed inconsistent with the Appellant's claim to be the  sole
    support for the Appellant's parents. However he had asked no  questions
    about that during the hearing and it was not therefore open to  him  to
    speculate on what those entries might mean.

12.  The Respondent had not challenged the  assertion  that  the  card  shop
    business had been transferred  into  the  name  of  the  Appellant  and
    therefore it was not open to the Judge to challenge it.   Although  the
    Judge had  said  at  paragraph  41  that  he  did  not  hear  from  the
    Appellant's wife, he had also noted elsewhere that she had  given  oral
    evidence.  The grounds described the  Appellant's  wife's  evidence  as
    "lengthy".

13.   The  Judge  had   misconstrued   the   Appellant's   family's   actual
    circumstances by stating  "it  cannot  seriously  be  argued  that  the
    Appellant should be allowed to remain in the UK so that his sister  can
    save up for her next marriage".   That  had  never  been  part  of  the
    Appellant's case.  The Judge had misapplied the test  in  the  case  of
    Kugathas.  The family ties must be committed, real  and  effective  and
    involve a level of support for each other.  If the Judge  had  directed
    himself correctly on the Kugathas test he  could  not  reasonably  have
    come to the conclusion that family life was  not  engaged  between  the
    Appellant and the adult members of his family given that they all lived
    in the same household and had done  for  more  than  five  years.   The
    Appellant was at the very least  if  not  the  sole  provider  for  the
    family,  certainly  the  main  breadwinner.   The  level  of   material
    financial  and  emotional  support  between  them  went  beyond  normal
    emotional ties.

14.  The Judge concluded that Article 8 was not engaged for the purposes  of
    family life and had therefore failed to gauge  the  proportionality  of
    the Respondent's decision.  Not only did it affect  the  Appellant  but
    other close family members too.  It was a stark interference  with  the
    family's Article 8 rights.  Given the Appellant's contribution  to  the
    economy, the interference was disproportionate.  The Judge had referred
    to the family being able to revert  to  state  support  if  they  found
    themselves in financial difficulties.

15.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  White  on  13th  May  2014.   He  was
    satisfied that  the  Judge  had  made  an  arguable  error  of  law  in
    misdirecting himself and/or making inadequate  findings.   In  granting
    permission to appeal he gave three examples:

    "(a) At paragraph 37 of the determination in finding  that  the  profit
         from the shop was inadequate  to  support  the  family,  the  Judge
         appears to fail to take  into  account  that  the  first  Appellant
         claimed also to receive  an  income  from  working  as  a  security
         manager (paragraphs 10 and 39).


    (b)  At paragraph 42 of the determination the Judge states "I  did  not
         hear from the [Mrs Abbas] " but the Judge at paragraph  13  of  the
         determination indicates that he did hear oral evidence from [her].


    (c)  At paragraph 39 the Judge states that he does not  find  that  the
         Appellant was running the card shop for three years as  he  claimed
         yet also records that the Appellant's  claim  to  do  so  was  "not
         really challenged" by the Respondent."

The Hearing before Me

16.  At the hearing before me the issue was whether there was  an  error  of
    law in the Judge's determination such that it fell to be set aside  and
    the decision remade.  If there was not then the decision  would  stand.
    It was conceded that the Appellant could not rely on paragraph 245AA of
    the  Immigration  Rules  (the  Respondent's   interpretation   in   the
    Immigration Rules of the evidential flexibility policy)  and  therefore
    it was not submitted that the Appellant met the Immigration Rules.  The
    issue was whether the Judge had erred in his treatment  of  Article  8.
    There were a number of  errors  of  fact  made  by  the  Judge  in  his
    determination.  It was noted that the  hearing  took  place  at  Hatton
    Cross on 10th February 2014 (there is a typographical error on  page  1
    of the determination which refers to it as being heard on 10th February
    2013, a year earlier) and the date that the determination was signed by
    the Judge on 30th March 2014, almost seven weeks later.  The delay  may
    have led to the Judge misstating the evidence in his determination.

17.  I queried with Counsel whether the Appellant was able to  explain  what
    the references in the bank account to payments received from  "mum  and
    dad" signified.  Counsel replied that she had not asked  the  Appellant
    about that as this was not the forum to explore the facts.

18.  There was clear evidence by way of a deed of transfer in 2011  to  show
    that the Appellant's father transferred the card shop business to  him.
    There was a misconstruction of the evidence to jump to  the  conclusion
    that the Appellant could not support the family on  �7,000  per  annum.
    That  may  have  arisen  because  of  the  delay   in   preparing   the
    determination.  The Judge could not have come to  the  conclusion  that
    family life was not engaged if he had had the correct approach  in  his
    mind.  The family were living together in the  same  household.   There
    was one further point that  was  not  in  Counsel's  grounds  that  the
    Immigration Rules made no provision for the relationship between  adult
    family members and therefore the claim could only be dealt  with  under
    Article 8.  The Judge's  errors  of  fact  were  so  egregious  because
    Article 8 must have been engaged that it could not be  said  the  Judge
    had properly assessed proportionality.

19.  In reply the Presenting Officer stated that the  Judge  was  aware  the
    Appellant had two jobs.  At paragraph 39 the Judge  had  remarked  that
    the Appellant's security work took up the best part  of  three  days  a
    week.  The point the Judge was making at paragraph 37 was that  it  was
    not only the Appellant who was working and earning  money.   The  Judge
    was well aware that the Appellant's wife had given  evidence.   He  had
    summarised it at paragraph 13.  Her  evidence  was  brief  and  it  was
    unfair to say that the Judge had got his facts wrong.  It  was  more  a
    case that the Appellant did not like the decision rather than the Judge
    was significantly wrong.  The Appellant  and  his  wife  would  not  be
    separated as a result of the removal decisions.

20.  There was nothing in the evidence to  indicate  that  the  relationship
    between the Appellants and the other adult family members  went  beyond
    normal emotional ties.  There was no reason why the business would  not
    keep ticking over.  Private life was engaged and the Judge carried  out
    a full balancing exercise at paragraph 46 of his  determination  taking
    into account the family relationships and made a complete assessment of
    the circumstances.   When one factored in the  ratio  in  the  case  of
    Gulshan [2013] UKUT  640  the  instant  case  did  not  meet  the  most
    exceptional circumstances.  It was not  said  that  the  Appellant  was
    dependent on his relatives but that they were dependent  on  him.   The
    Judge's finding was they were all living together.  The  Appellant  did
    not satisfy the Rules. The Judge clearly had the  case  of  Gulshan  in
    mind when referring to the public  interest  at  paragraph  48  of  the
    determination.  The passage of time between hearing  and  determination
    did not materially affect the matter.

21.  Finally in reply Counsel argued that the Judge's comments at  paragraph
    46 of the determination could not possibly reflect the public interest.
     In that paragraph the Judge had said the Appellant's  departure  would
    not lead to the demise of the family business but even if it did it was
    a risk the family chose to take when they put the business in the hands
    of someone with limited leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom.   Even
    if, which the Judge did not accept,  the  Appellant's  departure  would
    cause the family serious financial difficulties, the  family  would  be
    entitled to state  support  if  they  were  unable  to  manage.   Those
    comments  it  was  argued  were  entirely  the  opposite  of  what  the
    Respondent would contend.  Far from being a burden on  the  state,  the
    Appellant stopped his family from being in that  position.   Errors  of
    fact made by the Judge amounted to  errors  of  law.   The  Appellant's
    sister was working part-time in Asda and  was  not  in  a  position  to
    contribute to the family finances.  She would not be  able  to  support
    them on the income she  had.   Although  no  one  was  suggesting  that
    Article 8 was always engaged, it was a low  threshold  and  the  family
    lived together as a unit.  It was thus  not  just  a  question  of  the
    financial dependency.  The Judge's decision should be set aside.

Findings

22.  The Appellant was not able  to  meet  the  Rules  because  he  had  not
    supplied the correct documentation to show his earnings.  Had  he  done
    so he might very well have been able to satisfy the Rules but there  is
    no such thing as a near miss and it was not in dispute before  me  that
    the Appellant was seeking to remain in the country and not  be  removed
    with his wife on the basis that their rights under Article 8  would  be
    breached.

23.  The burden of showing this rested upon the Appellants  which  they  had
    to discharge to the standard of  the  balance  of  probabilities.   The
    Judge found in relation to family life that the Appellants were  living
    with a number  of  adult  family  members,  and  that  as  this  was  a
    relationship of adults there were no more than normal  emotional  ties.
    As a result Article 8 was not engaged at all.  In relation  to  private
    life, this would be affected by the Appellant's removal but could be re-
    established in Pakistan.  The couple would not be turned out  onto  the
    street and the claim that they would be (by the Appellant's father) was
    an example of the Appellant's father's exaggeration which led the Judge
    to place little weight on that evidence.

24.  Before me the Judge's findings in relation to  private  life  were  not
    seriously disputed.  The issue turned on the Judge's treatment  of  the
    claim  to   have   an   established   family   life   that   would   be
    disproportionately  interfered  with.   The  argument  the  Appellant's
    behalf was that the relationship  between  the  adults  did  go  beyond
    normal emotional ties thus engaging Article 8(1).

25.  The Judge rejected the contention that there was a  dependency  by  the
    Appellant's parents on the Appellant.   He  did  not  accept  that  the
    Appellant's departure would lead to the demise of the family  business.
    Even if it did, that was a risk that the family had run in putting  the
    business in the hands of the Appellant.  The Judge's reference  to  the
    family being entitled to state support does not necessarily  mean  that
    the Judge expected that the family would claim income  support  if  the
    Appellant were to be returned to Pakistan.  State support  can  mean  a
    number of things including for example tax credits which are not  taken
    into account when assessing financial eligibility under the Immigration
    Rules.  However the more important point is  that  the  Judge  did  not
    accept that that situation would  arise.   His  finding  was  that  the
    Appellant's departure would not lead to the demise of the business.  It
    would not cause serious financial difficulties.   His  comment  in  the
    alternative, even if wrong, was therefore irrelevant and  little  turns
    on that objection to the determination.

26.   In  reality  the  grounds  of  onward  appeal  are  no  more  than   a
    disagreement with the result.  A number of relatively minor points were
    taken against the determination but when viewed as a whole it is  clear
    that the Judge gave cogent reasons why he did not  accept  the  claimed
    dependency.  I consider that there is also little in the argument  that
    due to a seven week delay between hearing the appeal  and  signing  off
    the determination errors may have crept into the Judge's  understanding
    of the facts.

27.  Whilst there does at first sight appear to be an inconsistency  between
    the Judge summarising the evidence of the Appellant's wife and  stating
    later on that he did not hear from her (at paragraph 41) he immediately
    went on to note that she was pregnant, evidence that she had  given  to
    him.  He referred to her pregnancy  again  at  paragraph  49.   He  was
    therefore  clearly  aware  of  her  evidence  when  arriving   at   his
    conclusions and based his conclusions on that evidence.  Any  "slip  of
    the pen" there might have been in stating that he did not hear from her
    was not of significance to the outcome of the case.

28.  The Judge's conclusion that it was implausible that  the  family  could
    be supported on profits from the shop of �7,000 per annum needs  to  be
    seen in context.  The Judge was well aware that the Appellant  had  two
    jobs.  At paragraph 39 he noted that the Appellant's security work took
    up the best part of three days a week.  The point  being  made  by  the
    Judge at paragraph 37 was that the family could not be supported on the
    proceeds of the card shop business alone.  That in turn has to be  seen
    in the context of the Judge's later remarks that if the Appellant  were
    to be returned to Pakistan the effect on the business would not  impact
    significantly on the family's finances as it was not enough  by  itself
    to support the whole family. The Judge's concern was that  he  had  not
    been given an accurate account of what  the  family's  income  actually
    was, hence his concerns about for example what the  Appellant's  sister
    was earning in her job.

29.  The difficulty for the Appellant's claim was  that  he  was  earning  a
    very substantial amount from his weekend work as a security manager but
    he was unable to prove that to the Respondent because of the failure to
    comply with the information requirements in the  Rules.   The  position
    before the Judge was very different to the Appellant's contention  that
    he was the major breadwinner earning substantial amounts of money  that
    were  supporting  him,  his  wife  and  five  adults.   There  was   no
    misunderstanding by the Judge of the dependency claim and it  was  open
    to the Judge to dismiss the appeal under Article 8 for the  reasons  he
    gave.  Without being able to establish dependency of the sort  claimed,
    the Appellants could not show that the decision engaged  Article  8(1).
    The various minor points in the determination mentioned in the grant of
    permission did not in my view significantly undermine the  validity  of
    the determination.

30.  In relation to the point that the Immigration Rules do not provide  for
    a relationship between adults, even if that is the case and I have  not
    heard sufficient detailed argument to find that, the  jurisprudence  on
    Article 8 particularly the case of Gulshan is clear that there must  be
    compelling reasons  why  someone  who  cannot  meet  the  Rules  should
    nevertheless be allowed to remain in a country outside the Rules.  That
    would only arise if there was compelling evidence that  a  relationship
    between adults should be allowed outside the  Rules.   This  case  fell
    short of that for the reasons given by the Judge.  There was  no  error
    of law in the Judge's determination and I therefore uphold his decision
    to dismiss the Appellants' appeal.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I uphold the decision to dismiss the Appellants' appeals.

Appeals dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

As I have dismissed the appeal no fee order is payable.



Signed this 29th  day of July   2014
