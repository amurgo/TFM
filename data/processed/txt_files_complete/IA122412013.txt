Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr O T Popoola, Community Legal Centre


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  by  Judge
   of the First-tier Tribunal Morgan allowing an appeal under Article  8  by
   Mr Chester Saleem St Martin (hereinafter referred to as "the applicant").



2) The applicant is a citizen of St Lucia.  He came to the UK  in  September
   2006 as a student.  In 2009 he made a successful application for leave to
   remain on the basis of marriage.  He was  granted  leave  until  February
   2012.  Prior to the expiry of his leave the marriage broke down  and  the
   appellant moved in with  his  current  partner.   In  February  2012  the
   applicant sought leave to remain as the unmarried partner  of  a  British
   national.  This was refused on 26 March  2013  and  it  is  against  this
   refusal that the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was brought.

3) Before the First-tier Tribunal the Secretary of  State  argued  that  the
   applicant did not satisfy the requirements of Appendix FM.  In particular
   he and his partner had not shown they had the required income or  savings
   to maintain themselves.

4) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal considered that Appendix FM did  not
   apply to the decision because the application was made in February  2012,
   prior  to  its  introduction  to  the  Immigration  Rules.    The   judge
   accordingly decided the appeal under Article 8.  The judge found that the
   applicant and his partner  started  cohabiting  in  January  2012.   They
   intend to marry.  The applicant's divorce was finalised 3 months prior to
   the hearing on 17 September 2013.  The applicant's partner is  a  British
   citizen who works as a deputy manager at a betting shop with an income of
   �21,500 per year.  The applicant works as a  courier  earning  �20,000  a
   year.

5) The judge went on to find that to expect the applicant to  return  to  St
   Lucia to apply for entry clearance was disproportionate.  He had  a  good
   immigration history and there was no sensible reason for requiring him to
   return to St Lucia simply to comply with the procedural  requirements  of
   entry clearance.  All the requirements for leave were  met  but  for  the
   requirement of entry clearance.  The financial provisions were satisfied.
    If the applicant's passport was returned the couple  would  be  able  to
   marry and satisfy the spousal provisions of the Immigration  Rules.   The
   judge went on to consider the delay between the application  in  February
   2012 and the refusal decision of March 2013.  The refusal decision was  a
   breach of Article 8.

6) Permission to appeal was granted on the application of the Respondent  on
   the basis that arguably the judge misdirected himself by not applying the
   appropriate test for return to St Lucia to apply for entry clearance.  It
   was further arguable that the judge failed to  identify  any  exceptional
   circumstances that would suggest that relocation by the applicant and his
   partner to St Lucia was an unjustifiably harsh outcome.

7) The  grant  of  leave  reflected  the  grounds  of  the  application  for
   permission to appeal.  These  contended  that  the  judge  was  wrong  to
   consider whether it was sensible or not to expect the applicant to  apply
   for entry clearance.  It was the duty of the Secretary of State to ensure
   that proper procedures  were  followed  and  there  were  no  exceptional
   circumstances that would  preclude  the  Secretary  of  State's  proposed
   course of action.  In  relation  to  the  meaning  of  "exceptional"  the
   Secretary of State sought to rely on the case of HH v  Deputy  Prosecutor
   of the Italian Republic, Genoa [2012] UKSC 25.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
   had not identified any features that would  mean  the  failure  to  grant
   leave would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences.

8) It was further submitted on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State  in  the
   application for permission to appeal that the judge made no  findings  on
   the option of relocation, as proposed by the Secretary of  State  in  the
   reasons for refusal letter.   There  were  no  exceptional  circumstances
   identified that would suggest that relocation was an unjustifiably  harsh
   outcome.  If it was found that the applicant would satisfy the provisions
   of the Immigration Rules then the applicant should made an application in
   line with the Rules.  There were no reasoned  findings  as  to  why  this
   would be an unreasonable course of action.

Submissions

9) At the hearing before me Mr Wilding, for the Secretary  of  State  sought
   to rely on the case of Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and the decision  of
   the Upper Tribunal in Green (Article 8 - New Rules) [2013] UKUT 254.   In
   assessing proportionality the judge  had  failed  to  consider  that  the
   applicant did not satisfy the Immigration Rules.   There  was  a  further
   error in failing to balance properly the conflicting interests of private
   life and the public interest.  It seemed to be inferred in paragraph 3 of
   the determination that the applicant could not meet the Immigration Rules
   but the question remained whether this was accepted by  the  judge.   The
   applicant could have sought to rely on paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM.  In
   terms of paragraph 48 of Nagre it was unlikely  the  applicant  would  be
   able to show a "good arguable case" why he should succeed under Article 8
   if he would not succeed under EX.1.   The  applicant  did  not  meet  the
   definition of an unmarried partner because he and  his  partner  had  not
   been cohabiting for 2 years.  There were no insurmountable  obstacles  to
   family life continuing outside the UK.  The applicant could not  rely  on
   Appendix FM as a fianc�.  The judge fell into error by not engaging  with
   public interest in firm and fair immigration control.

10) It was put to Mr Wilding that the phrase "no sensible reason" was  taken
   from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Hayat [2012] EWCA  Civ  1054.
   Mr Wilding questioned the  relevance  of  Hayat  because  the  judge  had
   ignored the issue of relocation to St Lucia as a couple.  This  made  the
   assessment incomplete.  The judge did not show how the Immigration  Rules
   were met.  The errors were material.  The decision should be remade  with
   further evidence and might be suitable for remitting  to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

11) For the applicant, Mr Popoola  submitted  that  the  judge  applied  the
   right test, which was one of reasonableness.  If the applicant went  back
   to St Lucia, he would  meet  the  rules  for  entry  clearance.   On  the
   question of relocation, the applicant and his partner chose to remain  in
   the UK.  The  position  of  the  Secretary  of  State  was  that  it  was
   reasonable for the applicant to return to St Lucia  to  apply  for  entry
   clearance.  However, the right test was applied and there was no error of
   law.  According to the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ
   1192, the test of insurmountable obstacles was to be equated with a  test
   of reasonableness.  Where the judge referred to there being  no  sensible
   reason, this could be equated to reasonableness.

12) In response Mr Wilding submitted that sensible did not  properly  equate
   to reasonable.  There were two aspects to  the  test  of  reasonableness.
   The first was the possibility of relocation and the second  was  that  of
   return to apply for entry  clearance.   The  judge's  decisions  on  each
   should be based on proper  findings.   No  findings  could  be  shown  in
   relation to this.  The determination was inadequate in this respect.
Discussion

13) The argument for the Secretary of State is based to a  large  extent  on
   an assumption that the application fell to be considered  under  Appendix
   FM of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  found
   that Appendix FM did not  apply  because  the  application  was  made  in
   February 2012, before Appendix FM came into force.

14) I note that according to Appendix FM it applies to  applications  "under
   this route made on or after 9 July 2012 and to applications under Part  8
   as set out in the Statement of  Changes made on  13  June  2012  (HC194),
   except as otherwise set out at  paragraphs  A277-A280."   This  is  given
   further  clarification  by  HC  194  itself,  which  states  that  if  an
   application for entry clearance, leave to remain or indefinite  leave  to
   remain has been made before 9 July 2012 and the application has not  been
   decided, it will be decided in accordance with the Rules in  force  on  8
   July 2012.

15) The terms of HC194 and Appendix FM support the view taken by  the  Judge
   of the First-tier Tribunal  that  Appendix  FM  did  not  apply  to  this
   application.   The  judge  was  therefore  entitled   to   consider   the
   application under Article 8 without specific reference to the changes  in
   the Immigration Rules made with effect from 9 July 2012.

16) The decision of the Court of Appeal in  Hayat  is  still  good  law,  at
   least so far as applications made  before  9  July  2012  are  concerned.
   Although the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not refer  specifically
   to Hayat, the test applied of there being no sensible reason  to  require
   the applicant to return to St Lucia to apply for entry clearance is taken
   directly from the judgment of Elias LJ at paragraph 30.  At paragraphs 27-
   29 of the judgment reference was  made  to  an  earlier  decision  in  MA
   (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA Civ 953, a case not dissimilar to the present one,
   where the Court found that the real question was not whether  there  were
   "insurmountable obstacles" to the applicant returning to his  country  of
   origin in order to make an application for entry  clearance  from  there,
   but whether there was any sensible reason as to why he should be required
   to do so.

17) This is the same approach that was taken by the Judge of the  First-tier
   Tribunal in the present appeal.  He found there was  no  sensible  reason
   why the applicant should be required to return to his country  of  origin
   to apply for entry clearance and the interference with  his  private  and
   family  life  resulting  from  a  requirement   to   do   so   would   be
   disproportionate.  This was a finding which the  judge  was  entitled  to
   make.  Whether the outcome would have been different had the  application
   been made after the coming into force of Appendix FM on 9  July  2012  is
   not a matter which I am  required  to  consider.   It  is  sufficient  to
   determine this appeal that having  regard  to  the  application  made  in
   February 2012 the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal was entitled  to  make
   the decision allowing the appeal under Article 8 and did not err in  law.





Conclusions

18) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error on a point of law.

19) I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

20) The First-tier Tribunal did not make a direction  for  anonymity  and  I
   see no reason to make such an order.
