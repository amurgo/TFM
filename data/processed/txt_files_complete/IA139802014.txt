For the Appellant:     Mr I Khan of Universal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

 1. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against the decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Napthine
    promulgated on 7th November 2014, who dismissed her appeal against  the
    Respondent's decision dated 6th March 2014, to refuse to vary leave and
    remove the Appellant from the United Kingdom.

 2. At a hearing on 25th February  2015  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was set aside as I found an error of law in that Article 8  of
    the 1950 European Convention on Human  Rights  had  been  raised  as  a
    Ground of Appeal but no findings had been made in relation  to  Article
    8.  The hearing had been adjourned so that the decision  could  be  re-
    made in relation to Article 8.

 3. Mr Khan indicated that the Appellant now wished to withdraw her appeal.
     Rule 17(2) of The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    states that a notice of withdrawal will  not  take  effect  unless  the
    Upper Tribunal consents to the withdrawal.  Mr Avery had no comment  to
    make on the withdrawal application.

 4. I  therefore  agreed  to  the  withdrawal  of  the  appeal.   There  is
    consequently no appeal before the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  Respondent's
    decision dated 6th March 2014 to refuse to vary leave to remain and  to
    remove the Appellant from the United Kingdom therefore stands.

No anonymity order is made.



Signed   Date 1st May 2015

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge M A Hall
