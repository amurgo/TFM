                                   Between

                                  THE QUEEN

                                                                   Applicant

Representation:

For the Applicant:           Mr. Paul Turner, Counsel, instructed directly
For the Respondent:    Mr. Nicholas Ostrowski, Counsel, instructed by the
                       Government Legal Department


   1)  Extra-statutory  immigration  policies  should  be   interpreted   in
      accordance with the objective meaning that a reasonable  and  literate
      person would ascribe to them.

   2) The Home Office discretionary leave  policy  should  not  be  read  as
      saying that, once it  is  decided  that  an  individual  continues  to
      qualify for further leave  on  the  same  basis  as  before,  he  must
      automatically be granted indefinite leave to  remain  after  6  years'
      continuous discretionary leave unless at the date of decision he falls
      within the restricted  leave  policy.  The  word  'normally'  is  used
      advisedly, so as to maintain the maximum possible discretion. Where  a
      policy governs what is to happen in the normal case, it  remains  open
      to the decision-maker to take a different course in a particular case,
      provided he or she takes account of the  policy  and  has  reason  for
      considering the case to be abnormal.

   3) There are four categories of cases  in  which  supplementary  reasons,
      supplied in response to an actual or threatened legal  challenge,  may
      be relied  upon:  first,  to  'elucidate'  reasons  previously  given;
      secondly, to constitute  a  'fresh  decision';  thirdly,  to  consider
      material not before the decision-maker at the time  when  the  earlier
      decision was taken; and fourthly, to  acknowledge  that  the  original
      decision was flawed but simultaneously make a  new  one  to  the  same
      effect.


   4) Even if the original decision is held to be unlawful, relief  must  be
      withheld pursuant to s.31(2A) of the  Senior  Courts  Act  1981  if  a
      further decision shows that it is highly likely that the outcome would
      not have been substantially different, unless the proviso in  s.31(2B)
      applies.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Claimant, Mr Michael Ellis, seeks judicial review of decisions of
    the Secretary of State on 21 March 2019 and 16 April 2019 to refuse his
    application for indefinite leave to remain ('ILR') and instead to grant
    him 3 years' Discretionary Leave ('DL').


 2. Permission to proceed was initially refused  on  the  papers,  but  was
    granted after an oral hearing on 18  October  2019  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Norton-Taylor, limited to one ground. This was that the  decision
    was unlawful given that the Secretary of State's policy  governing  the
    grant of DL outside the Immigration  Rules,  contained  in  the  Asylum
    Policy Instruction: Discretionary Leave, version 7.0, published  on  18
    August 2015 ('the DL Policy'), provides that  those  who  have  already
    completed two 3-year periods of DL should 'normally' be granted ILR.

Background


 3. Mr Ellis is a national of Jamaica. He entered the UK as a visitor on  7
    August 2000. His leave to remain was extended to 26  January  2001.  He
    married Jennen Blair in 2002 and, on 13 August 2003, applied for  leave
    to remain as the spouse of a settled person. That decision was refused,
    but not until 29 October 2010. In the intervening period,  he  had  met
    his current wife, Tinisha Elliston, with whom he had two children, both
    British citizens, born on 5 September 2006 and 6 December 2012.


 4. On 23 February 2010, Mr Ellis claimed asylum. That claim was refused on
    29 October 2010 and his appeal rights were exhausted on 25  June  2011.
    In the meantime, on 26 March 2010,  he  was  sentenced  to  12  months'
    imprisonment for obtaining property by deception.


 5. After the exhaustion of his appeal rights, Mr Ellis applied  for  leave
    to remain. DL was granted for 3 years from  14  September  2011  to  13
    September 2014. On 9 September 2014, he made an application  to  extend
    that leave. That was granted on 5 April 2016, for a  further  3  years.
    So, by 9 March 2019, when he made the application which  triggered  the
    challenged decision, he had been in the UK lawfully,  pursuant  to  two
    grants of DL, for 7 ï¿½ years.


 6.  There  had,  however,  been  one  potentially  significant  change  of
    circumstances. On 1 March 2017,  Mr  Ellis  had  been  sentenced  to  4
    months' imprisonment for perverting the course of justice.

Mr Ellis's application for ILR

 7. On 9 March 2019, Mr Ellis applied for ILR using form SET  LR.  This  is
    the form applicable to applications for settled status or  ILR  on  the
    basis of long residence. He declared his criminal convictions  and,  in
    the box seeking 'evidence of an active relationship  with  a  child  or
    parent or medical evidence such as evidence of ill health', said this:


         'I need to stay in the UK for the [sic] my children and my wife.  I
         am an active father in my children's life. I attend and participate
         in my children's extracurricular activities, I take them to  school
         and attend the school events (sports days,  summer  fairs  etc).  I
         participate in the  fundraising  events  they  attend  Boy  Scouts,
         Guitar Lessons, Swimming Lessons, Football Lessons and  Jigsaw  Art
         School. My wife is a Senior Staff Nurse in a Hospital and she works
         150 hours a month commuting four hours a day to North  West  London
         where she works a mixture of Long  Day  Shifts,  Night  shifts  and
         Weekend shifts, including  during  holidays.  There  is  no  OFSTED
         Registered childcare provider available from the  time  she  starts
         work to the time she finishes, I am the only  available  person  to
         take care of our children whilst she works  especially  during  her
         unsociable working hours. I contribute to the running of my  church
         by donating equipment, food and provide my services (catering) when
         our church have events.'




The Secretary of State's decision of 21 March 2019

 8. On 21 March 2019, an official acting on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State wrote to Mr Ellis in these terms:

         'We have considered your application and you  do  not  qualify  for
         indefinite leave to remain. The reasons for this  are  set  out  in
         Annex A to this letter.


         However, we are satisfied that you would fall to be granted limited
         leave to remain of 36 months on the basis of continuing to  satisfy
         the  Discretionary  Leave  policy,  were  you  to  make   a   valid
         application for such leave. The detailed reasons for this  are  set
         out in Annex A.'


 9. Annex A set out Mr  Ellis's  immigration  history  and  noted  his  two
    custodial sentences. Under the heading 'Reasons you do not qualify  for
    a grant of indefinite leave to remain', it said this:

         'We are not satisfied that you meet the requirements of  276B(i)(a)
         of the Immigration Rules because you do not have  10  years  lawful
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom. Your first period of DL  was
         granted on 14 September 2011, you have therefore only  completed  7
         years, 6 months of continuous lawful leave in the United Kingdom.'


10. It was also pointed out it was less than 7 years since the end  of  the
    sentence imposed as a result of his second conviction and that this was
    a ground  for  refusal  of  ILR  under  paragraph  322(1C)(ii)  of  the
    Immigration Rules. This was then said:


         'Therefore,  having  considered  all  the  circumstances  of   your
         particular case, it has been concluded  that  you  have  failed  to
         establish that there are any significantly compelling reasons which
         justify granting you settlement here on an exceptional basis.


         As your application is not being sought for a  purpose  covered  by
         the Immigration Rules and falls for refusal on the  basis  of  your
         criminal convictions,  it  is  refused  under  Paragraph  322(1)  &
         322(1C)(ii) of HC 395 (as amended).'

11.  Under  the  heading  'Reasons  you  would  qualify  for  a  grant   of
    discretionary leave',  after  noting  that  the  application  had  been
    considered under Appendix FM and paragraphs  276ADE(1)-CE  and  on  the
    basis of exceptional circumstances, the Secretary of State said this:

         'We are satisfied that you continue to meet the requirements of the
         discretionary leave policy.'



The claim for judicial review

12. After pre-action correspondence, Mr Ellis issued a claim  for  judicial
    review on 3 June 2019. The first ground of challenge was that,  in  the
    light of the policy on DL, the grant of 3 years' DR, rather  than  ILR,
    was unlawful. It was said that the decision-maker 'erred by  having  no
    proper regard to [Mr Ellis's] circumstances and little  regard  to  the
    policy'. As I have said, this is the only ground in  respect  of  which
    permission to proceed was granted.


The Secretary of State's supplementary letter


13. After permission was granted, the Secretary of  State  sent  a  further
    letter, dated 25 November 2019, to Mr Ellis. It was signed by the  same
    decision-maker (whose code was LIVSET 5) and said this:

         'As you are aware, your application was the subject of  a  decision
         letter dated 21 March 2019 which you  have  challenged  by  way  of
         judicial review. This letter supplements the decision letter  dated
         21 March 2019.


         We have considered your application and  you  do  not  qualify  for
         indefinite leave to remain. The reasons for this  are  set  out  in
         Annex A to this letter.


         However, we are prepared  to  exercise  discretion  to  grant  more
         limited leave because your circumstances have not changed since the
         first grant of Discretionary Leave, but  we  are  not  prepared  to
         exercise discretion to grant settlement. The detailed  reasons  for
         this are set out in Annex A.'


14. Annex A was similar to the previous version, save that the  heading  at
    the end read 'Reasons we are prepared to  exercise  the  discretion  to
    grant more limited leave' and in the final paragraph said this:

         'We are prepared to exercise discretion to grant more limited leave
         because your circumstances have not changed since the  first  grant
         of Discretionary  Leave,  but  we  are  not  prepared  to  exercise
         discretion to grant settlement considering the criminality that  is
         detailed above.'


The relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules and policy

15. Mr Paul Turner, who appeared for Mr Ellis and made helpful submissions,
    accepts that Mr  Ellis's  application  did  not  satisfy  the  relevant
    provisions of the Immigration Rules. It is therefore not  necessary  to
    burden this decision with detailed citation of those Rules.  In  short,
    the Secretary of State was correct to note that what was required under
    paragraph 276B(i) was 10 years'  continuous  lawful  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom (Mr Ellis had only 7 ï¿½ at the time of  application)  and
    that in any event he fell for refusal under  the  general  grounds  for
    refusal in paragraphs 276B(iii) and 322(1C)(iii) (because it  was  less
    than 7 years since the end of his last custodial sentence).


16. Mr Turner accepts that Mr Ellis used the wrong form for an  application
    for leave to remain outside the Rules (SET (LR) rather than SET O), but
    he submitted - in my judgment correctly -  that  this  did  not  matter
    because the Secretary of State went  on  to  consider  his  application
    under the DL Policy in any event.


17. The title of the DL Policy (Asylum  Policy  Instruction:  Discretionary
    Leave) is misleading because, as is made clear in  ï¿½1.1,  it  'explains
    the limited circumstances in which it may be appropriate  to  grant  DL
    and applies in both asylum and non-asylum cases  applying  from  within
    the UK'. The policy is 'intended to cover exceptional and compassionate
    circumstances and, as such, should be used sparingly'. At  ï¿½1.2,  under
    the heading 'Background' this is said:


         'The Immigration Rules are designed to cover the vast  majority  of
         circumstances in which migrants will be granted leave because  they
         are entitled to remain in the UK. However, there are a small number
         of Home Office policies that recognise there may be individuals who
         do not meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules,  but  there
         are none the less  exceptional  and/or  compassionate  reasons  for
         allowing them to remain here.'


18. ï¿½1.4, headed  'Application  in  respect  of  children  and  those  with
    children', provides as follows:

         'The application of  this  guidance  must  take  into  account  the
         circumstances of each case and the impact on children, or on  those
         with children, in the UK. Section 55 of  the  Borders,  Citizenship
         and Immigration Act 2009 places an obligation on the  Secretary  of
         State to take account of the need  to  safeguard  and  promote  the
         welfare of children in the UK when carrying out immigration, asylum
         and nationality functions.


         In practice, this requires a consideration to be made of  the  best
         interests of the child in decisions that have  an  impact  on  that
         child. This is particularly important where the decision may result
         in the child having to  leave  the  UK,  where  there  are  obvious
         factors that adversely affect the child, or where a  parent  caring
         for the  child  asks  us  to  take  particular  circumstances  into
         account. All decisions  must  demonstrate  that  the  child's  best
         interests have been considered as a primary,  but  not  necessarily
         the only, consideration...


         ...


         In  cases  where  it  is  considered  appropriate  to   grant   DL,
         caseworkers must also consider whether to  exercise  discretion  in
         relation to the length of leave to be granted. This  is  because  a
         decision about duration of leave granted outside the  rules  is  an
         immigration function to which section 55  applies.  The  length  of
         leave must be decided on the individual facts of  the  case.  While
         granted 30 months' leave will generally be appropriate,  leave  may
         be  granted  for  shorter  or   longer   periods,   including,   in
         particularly compelling circumstances, indefinite leave to  remain.
         Caseworkers must demonstrate they have had regard  to  the  child's
         best interests when  considering  the  type  and  length  of  leave
         granted following a decision to grant leave under the DL policy.'

19. The principles to be applied when deciding whether to grant  leave  are
    set out in ï¿½3. ï¿½3.6 requires caseworkers to consider the impact  of  an
    individual's criminal history before granting any leave. The  following
    guidance also appears:


         'In cases where there are exceptional reasons for  granting  DL  to
         someone with a criminal  history  who  does  not  fall  within  the
         restricted leave policy, the duration of leave to be granted, up to
         30 months will depend on the individual circumstances of the case.'


20. Duration of leave is dealt with at ï¿½5. Mr Turner  initially  relied  on
    ï¿½5.1, which provides as follows:

         'Where  removal  is  no  longer  considered  appropriate  following
         consideration of the exceptional factors set out in paragraph  353B
         of the  Immigration  Rules  and  guidance  in  chapter  53  of  the
         Enforcement Immigration Guidance (EIG), 30  months'  DL  should  be
         granted, unless one of the following situations applies:


            . where the UK  border  agency  (as  it  was)  made  a  written
              commitment that the case would be considered either before 20
              July 2011 or before 9 July 2012, but failed to do so, and  it
              is later decided that a grant is appropriate


            . where the UK Border Agency (as it was) made a decision either
              before 20 July 2011 or before 9 July 2012  that  a  grant  of
              leave on the grounds  then  listed  in  Chapter  53  was  not
              appropriate, but after that date reconsider that decision and
              - on the basis  of  the  same  evidence  (i.e.  the  evidence
              available to the original caseworker) - it  is  decided  that
              the earlier decision was wrong and  leave  should  have  been
              granted

         Where the above applies and the relevant date was  before  20  July
         2011, Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) outside the rules should  be
         granted. This is because before  20  July  2011  ILR  was  normally
         granted in cases which met the exceptional  circumstances  criteria
         in Chapter 53. Where the above applies and the  relevant  date  was
         before 9 July 2012, three years' DL should  be  granted,  with  the
         person normally becoming eligible to apply for settlement  after  2
         periods of 3 years' DL (6 years' continuous leave). This is because
         from 20 July 2011 to 8 July 2012 the UK border agency (as  it  was)
         granted  three  years  DL  in  cases  that  met   the   exceptional
         circumstances criteria in Chapter 53.'

21. Mr Turner initially placed considerable weight  on  this  part  of  the
    policy, but for reasons I shall explain the point  he  was  seeking  to
    derive from ï¿½5.1 is in any event evidenced from ï¿½10.1.


22. Further leave applications are dealt with  in  ï¿½7,  which  provides  as
    follows:


         'This section applies to those granted and an initial period of  DL
         on  or  after  9  July  2012.  See  section  10   on   Transitional
         Arrangements for cases where DL was granted before 9 July 2012.


         In most cases, a person will  not  become  eligible  to  apply  for
         settlement until they have completed a  continuous  period  of  120
         months' (10 years') limited leave.'


23. The transitional arrangements are set out in ï¿½10. At ï¿½10.1,  under  the
    heading 'Applicants granted DL  before  9  July  2012',  the  following
    appears:

         'Those granted leave under the DL policy in  force  before  9  July
         2012 will normally continue to be  dealt  with  under  that  policy
         through to settlement if they continue to qualify for further leave
         on the same basis as the original DL  was  granted  (normally  they
         will be eligible to apply for settlement after  accruing  6  years'
         continuous DL (or where appropriate a combination of DL and LOTR, C
         section 8 above)), unless at the date of decision they fall  within
         the restricted leave policy.


         Caseworkers must consider whether the circumstances  prevailing  at
         the time of the original grant of leave continue at the date of the
         decision. If the circumstances remain the same, the individual does
         not fall within the restricted leave  policy  and  the  criminality
         thresholds do not apply, a further period of  3  years'  DL  should
         normally be granted. Caseworkers must consider  whether  there  are
         any circumstances that may  warrant  departure  from  the  standard
         period of leave. See Section 5.4 [which deals with  modern  slavery
         cases, including trafficking].'

Submissions for Mr Ellis


24. Mr Turner's submissions on behalf of Mr  Ellis  may  be  summarised  as
    follows. The original decision of 21 March 2019 dealt  in  some  detail
    with the claim for ILR under the Immigration  Rules,  but  the  section
    dealing with the grant of DL was terse. That part of the  decision  did
    no more than state a conclusion: that the decision-maker was  satisfied
    that Mr Ellis continued to meet the requirements of  the  discretionary
    leave policy. It gave no reason at  all  for  concluding  that  it  was
    appropriate to grant 3 years' DL rather than ILR, which would have been
    'normal' under the DL policy for a person in Mr  Ellis's  position  who
    could show a continuous period of 6 years' lawful  residence.  In  that
    respect it was unlawful. The supplementary letter of 25 November  2019,
    which postdated the issue of this claim,  should  not  be  admitted  in
    evidence because it is an attempt to bolster the original  decision  by
    adding a  reason  that  was  not  previously  given:  that  Mr  Ellis's
    criminality itself supplied a reason for departing  from  the  'normal'
    position under the policy. Reliance  was  placed  on  the  judgment  of
    Underhill LJ (with which Beatson and Black LJJ agreed)  in  Caroopen  v
    Secretary of state for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 1307, [2017]
    1 WLR 2339. Even if the supplementary letter were  admissible,  it  too
    was inadequately reasoned. There was no consideration  of  the  factors
    advanced by Mr Ellis as relevant to his application - in particular the
    low  level  of  the  criminality  in  his  case,  the  extent  of   his
    relationship with  his  children  and  his  family  circumstances  more
    generally.


Submissions for the Secretary of State

25. For the Secretary of State, Mr Ostrowski submitted that  the  21  March
    2019 decision letter had to be read as a whole. For  that  proposition,
    reliance was placed on Zoumbas  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] UKSC 74, [2013] 1 WLR  3690,  at  [19]  (Lord  Hodge,
    delivering the judgment of the court). Read in that way, the  first  of
    the paragraphs quoted at [10] above should be understood as  applicable
    to the refusal of ILR under the DL policy as well as to the refusal  of
    ILR under the Immigration Rules. The letter clearly set out Mr  Ellis's
    history of criminality and it was obvious that this was the reason  for
    granting 3 months' DL, rather than ILR. That reflected a  rational  and
    (if it is necessary so to submit)  correct  interpretation  of  the  DL
    policy and a lawful application of it.  (Reliance  was  placed  on  the
    decisions of Maurice Kay J in R (Gashi) v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2003] EWHC 1198, [13]-[15], and Beatson J in R  (K)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWHC 3102, [45],  for
    the proposition that, in the immigration field at least, it is for  the
    Secretary of State  to  interpret  her  own  policy,  subject  only  to
    rationality review.) In any event, the supplementary letter  should  be
    admitted. It was merely an elucidation of  the  reasons  given  in  the
    earlier decision and so fell into the first category set out at [30] of
    Underhill LJ's judgment in Caroopen. If that were wrong, it was  a  new
    decision, which was adequately reasoned. That  being  so,  there  would
    therefore be no point in  granting  relief  in  respect  of  the  first
    decision. Indeed, such relief would be  barred  by  s.  31(2A)  of  the
    Senior Courts Act 1981, because it is not  only  'highly  likely',  but
    inevitable, that the outcome would have been the same  irrespective  of
    any failure to give reasons in the first decision.

My conclusions

26. The sole ground of challenge for which permission has been  granted  is
    that the decision to grant 3 years' DL, rather than ILR,  was  unlawful
    in this case given that, under the DL policy, a person  in  Mr  Ellis's
    position would 'normally' be granted ILR.

The duty to give reasons

27. What counts as adequate reasons depends on the circumstances. In  South
    Buckinghamshire District Council v Porter (No. 2) [2004]  1  WLR  1953,
    Lord Brown said this at [36]:


         'The reasons for a decision must be intelligible and they  must  be
         adequate. They must enable the reader to understand why the  matter
         was decided as it was and what  conclusions  were  reached  on  the
         "principal important  controversial  issues",  disclosing  how  any
         issue of law or fact was resolved. Reasons can be  briefly  stated,
         the degree of particularity  required  depending  entirely  on  the
         nature of the issues falling for decision. The reasoning  must  not
         give rise to a substantial doubt as to whether  the  decision-maker
         erred in law, for example by misunderstanding some relevant  policy
         or some other important matter or by failing to  reach  a  rational
         decision on relevant grounds. But such adverse inference  will  not
         readily be drawn. The reasons need refer only to the main issues in
         the dispute, not  to  every  material  consideration. They  should
         enable  disappointed  developers  to  assess  their  prospects   of
         obtaining some alternative development permission, or, as the  case
         may be, their unsuccessful opponents to understand how  the  policy
         or approach underlying the grant  of  permission  may  impact  upon
         future such applications.  Decision  letters  must  be  read  in  a
         straightforward manner, recognising  that  they  are  addressed  to
         parties well  aware  of  the  issues  involved  and  the  arguments
         advanced. A reasons  challenge  will  only  succeed  if  the  party
         aggrieved  can  satisfy  the  court  that  he  has  genuinely  been
         substantially prejudiced by the failure to  provide  an  adequately
         reasoned decision.'


28. This passage has been applied generally in public law cases,  including
    in the immigration field: see RG (Ethiopia) v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2006] EWCA Civ 339, [36] (Keene LJ).


The correct approach to  the  interpretation  of  non-statutory  immigration
policies


29. In Gashi, Maurice Kay J considered a  challenge  to  a  decision  taken
    under the Secretary of State's policy on the exercise of discretion  in
    safe third country cases. The Secretary of State made  two  alternative
    submissions: first that his  interpretation  accorded  with  the  'true
    construction' of the policy; second, and in the  alternative,  that  it
    was reasonably open to the Secretary of State to  read  the  policy  in
    that way: see at [5]. Maurice Kay J rejected the  first  submission  at
    [6]-[12]. In the course of rejecting the second, at [14], he posed  the
    question  'was  the  construction  placed  upon  [the  policy]  by  the
    Secretary of State nevertheless reasonably open to him?'  At  [15],  he
    answered that question in the negative.


30. In R (Raissi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008]  EWCA
    Civ 72, [2008] QB 836, the Court of Appeal held that,  in  interpreting
    an ex gratia compensation scheme made by a minister, the  test  was  to
    ask what a reasonable and literate man's understanding of it would  be,
    not whether the meaning attributed to it by the  decision-maker  was  a
    reasonable one.


31. The issue was considered further in R (SS) v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2008] EWHC 2069 (Admin), at [18]-[22]. There, Blair  J
    cited Raissi, noted that there was 'force' in the submission that  what
    he described as the Gashi approach (that the interpretation  of  policy
    was for the minister subject only  to  rationality  review)  should  be
    applied to policy whose purpose was to provide 'guidance  to  decision-
    makers within the department': see at [21]. However, as he  made  clear
    at [22], he did not need to determine the point.


32. In K, at [45], Beatson J observed that Gashi had decided that the court
    should  ask  whether  an  interpretation  of  policy   was   Wednesbury
    reasonable, noted that it had not been cited to the court in Raissi and
    suggested that the principles applicable to a policy  directed  'solely
    internally' may differ from those  applicable  to  a  policy  that  was
    'substantially published'.


33. For my part, I  do  not  consider  that  Gashi  is  authority  for  the
    proposition for which Beatson J cited it in K. In Gashi, there  was  no
    need  for  Maurice  Kay  J  to  decide  the  correct  approach  to  the
    interpretation of policy  because  the  claim  succeeded  even  on  the
    Secretary of State's deferential approach. As I read  Maurice  Kay  J's
    decision, he did not in fact decide which approach was the  right  one.
    But even if Gashi had decided what Beatson  J  thought  it  decided,  I
    would not follow it, even in the context of extra-statutory immigration
    decisions.


34.  There  are  some  jurisdictions  where  decision-makers   subject   to
    administrative law are permitted to interpret for themselves the  norms
    that govern their action, subject to  review  on  a  reasonableness  or
    rationality standard. This is the approach  adopted  in  United  States
    federal courts under the Chevron doctrine (Chevron USA Inc.  v  Natural
    Resources Defence Council Inc. 467 US 837 (1984)), which applies to the
    interpretation of statutes as well as policy. The UK courts have  never
    adopted this approach to the interpretation of statute. There were some
    planning and environmental cases concerned with the  interpretation  of
    policy, however, in which a similar  approach  was  adopted:  see  e.g.
    Cranage Parish Council v First Secretary  of  State  [2004]  EWHC  2949
    (Admin), [2005] 2 P&CR 23, [44]-[48]  (Davis  J).  All  this,  however,
    predates three significant  Supreme  Court  cases.  In  Mahad  v  Entry
    Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16, [2010] 1 WLR 48, at [10], Lord  Brown
    (with whom the other  members  of  the  court  agreed)  held  that  the
    Immigration Rules were to be construed objectively by the court.  In  R
    (Kambadzi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 23,
    [2011] 1 WLR 1299, at [36], Lord Hope (with whom Lord Kerr agreed) held
    that it is for the courts, not the Secretary of State, to interpret the
    Operational Enforcement Manual. And  in  Tesco  Stores  v  Dundee  City
    Council [2012] UKSC 13, 2012 SC (UKSC) 278, a planning  case  concerned
    with the interpretation of a development plan,  Lord  Reed  (with  whom
    Lord Brown, Lord Kerr and Lord Dyson agreed) said this at [18]:


         'The  development  plan  is  a  carefully  drafted  and  considered
         statement of policy, published in order to inform the public of the
         approach which will be followed by planning authorities in decision-
         making unless there is  good  reason  to  depart  from  it.  It  is
         intended  to  guide  the  behavior  of  developers   and   planning
         authorities. As in other areas of administrative law, the  policies
         which it sets out are designed to secure consistency and  direction
         in the exercise of discretionary powers, while allowing  a  measure
         of flexibility to be retained. Those considerations suggest that in
         principle, in this area of public administration as in  others  (as
         discussed, for example, in R (Raissi) v Secretary of State for  the
         Home  Department  [2008]  QB  836),  policy  statements  should  be
         interpreted objectively in accordance with the language used,  read
         as always in its proper context.'


35. The considerations mentioned by Lord Reed in this passage  are,  in  my
    judgment, no less applicable to  extra-statutory  immigration  policies
    such as the DL Policy than they are to development plans. The DL Policy
    is intended to promote consistency in the treatment  of  a  very  large
    number of applications.  Once  a  policy  such  as  the  DL  Policy  is
    published, it is difficult to see why the principles applicable to  its
    interpretation should  differ  according  to  whether  it  is  directed
    internally to decision-makers or intended to  be  relied  upon  by  the
    public. Whatever the purpose of the Secretary of  State  in  publishing
    it, members of the public are entitled  to,  and  do,  rely  on  it  in
    deciding  whether  to  spend  considerable  sums  of  money  in  making
    applications for leave  to  remain.  It  would  be  inimical  to  legal
    certainty if the Secretary of State were  permitted  (even  subject  to
    rationality review) to interpret it other than in accordance  with  the
    objective meaning that a reasonable and literate person  would  ascribe
    to it.


36. Auburn, Moffett  and  Sharland,  in  Judicial  Review:  Principles  and
    Procedure (Oxford, 2013) at ï¿½21.45, identify the approach attributed by
    Beatson J to Maurice Kay J in Gashi as founding a possible exception to
    the general rule of objective interpretation in  cases  concerning  the
    interpretation  of  non-statutory  immigration  policies.  At   ï¿½21.46,
    however, they say this:


         'It is difficult to see this exception to the  general  rule  being
         applied in the future, as the principled justification for adopting
         an objective approach to the  interpretation  of  policies  applies
         just as much, if not more so, in  the  immigration  context  as  in
         other contexts: immigration decisions can be of acute importance to
         individuals and immigration policies may  be  applied  across  very
         many cases. Further, in  light  of  the  fact  that  policies  must
         usually be published, the reason for the  exception  is  likely  to
         fall away. In addition, the fact that such policies are  likely  to
         impact on individuals' Convention rights also makes it likely  that
         they will have to be accorded a consistent and accessible meaning.'


    I agree.


The true construction of the DL Policy

37. ï¿½5.1 of the DL Policy, on which Mr Turner initially placed considerable
    weight, is not - on its true construction -  applicable  here  at  all.
    ï¿½5.1 makes clear the usual duration of DL  should  be  30  months.  The
    exceptions are the cases falling  within  the  two  bullet  points.  Mr
    Ellis's case plainly does not fall within either of these: there was no
    written commitment  in  his  case  to  consider  the  case  before  any
    particular date; and there was  no  decision  at  any  stage  that  any
    earlier decision had been wrong.  The  paragraph  appearing  after  the
    bullet point starts with the words  'Where  the  above  applies'.  This
    shows that it applies only to cases falling within one or other of  the
    two bullet points above. Since this case did not fall within either  of
    those two bullet points, the paragraph had no application to this case.


38. ï¿½10.1 does, however, apply. In my judgment, the  true  meaning  of  the
    passages set out at [23] above is as follows.


39. First, those (such as Mr Ellis) granted leave under the  DL  Policy  in
    force before 9 July 2012 will 'normally'  continue  to  be  dealt  with
    under that policy if they continue to qualify for further leave on  the
    same basis, unless they fall within the  restricted  leave  policy.  Mr
    Ostrowski accepts that, because the Secretary of State decided that  Mr
    Ellis continued to qualify for  leave  and  did  not  fall  within  the
    restricted leave policy, he fell to be dealt with  in  accordance  with
    the DL Policy applicable before 9 July 2012.


40. Second, the DL Policy applicable before 9 July 2012 was that those  who
    had accrued 6 years' continuous leave would 'normally' be eligible  for
    ILR. The words used are 'eligible to apply for ILR',  but  the  context
    here includes the second paragraph quoted at  [23]  above.  When  those
    paragraphs are read together, a reasonable and  literate  reader  would
    understand that - at least in a 'normal' case - an individual  who  has
    already been granted 3 years' DL will be granted a further 3 years'  DL
    on the second application and ILR on the third.


41. Third, caseworkers should consider whether there are circumstances that
    warrant a departure from the norm. The policy  does  not  specify  what
    might justify such a departure, but a  criminal  conviction  since  the
    last occasion when the  matter  was  considered  could,  in  principle,
    plainly do so.


42. It follows from the above that I do not read the DL  Policy  as  saying
    that, once it is decided that an individual continues  to  qualify  for
    further leave on the same basis as before,  he  must  automatically  be
    granted ILR after 6 years' continuous DL unless at the date of decision
    he falls within the restricted leave policy.  The  word  'normally'  is
    used advisedly, so as to  maintain  the  maximum  possible  discretion.
    Consistently with the usual position in  administrative  law,  where  a
    policy governs what is to happen in the normal case, it remains open to
    the decision-maker to take a different course  in  a  particular  case,
    provided he or she takes account of  the  policy  and  has  reason  for
    considering the case to be abnormal.

The challenge to the decision of 21 March 2019


43. The decision of 21 March 2019 must be read as a whole, bearing in  mind
    that its author is not a lawyer. Nonetheless, I am unable to accept  Mr
    Ostrowski's submission that the first paragraph set out at  [10]  above
    can be seen as giving a reason for the grant of  3  years'  DL,  rather
    than ILR, under the DL Policy. It is not simply that  the  position  of
    that  paragraph  strongly  suggests  that  it  was  directed   to   the
    Immigration Rules. The content does not address the question  that  the
    DL Policy required the decision-maker to answer.  The  conclusion  that
    'you  have  failed  to  establish  that  there  are  any  significantly
    compelling reasons which justify granting you  settlement  here  on  an
    exceptional basis' reflects  the  wording  of  paragraph  353B  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  (which  poses  the  question  whether   there   are
    'exceptional circumstances which mean  that  removal  from  the  United
    Kingdom is no longer appropriate'). But it is not apt  to  address  the
    separate and quite different question arising under  ï¿½10.1  of  the  DL
    Policy: whether there are  reasons  for  departing  from  the  'normal'
    position that a person granted  DL  prior  to  9  July  2012  would  be
    eligible for ILR after 6 years' continuous DL. Indeed, it is not  clear
    that the decision-maker directed his or her mind  to  the  duration  of
    leave at all.


44. As to the text under the heading 'Reasons you would qualify for a grant
    of discretionary leave', that merely  reports  a  conclusion  that  the
    decision-maker is  satisfied  that  Mr  Ellis  continues  to  meet  the
    requirements of the discretionary leave policy. I agree with Mr  Turner
    that no reason, let alone an adequate one, is given for departing  from
    the 'normal position' that ILR will be granted. Indeed,  the  terms  of
    the decision do not enable me to be satisfied that  the  decision-maker
    had the DL Policy in mind at all.


45. I have borne in mind that Mr Ellis's application was made on  form  SET
    (LR). That being so, it may  be  that  no  criticism  could  have  been
    levelled at the decision-maker had he or she not considered whether  to
    grant DL at all. But the decision-maker did choose to consider DL  and,
    having done so, had to consider it in accordance with the DL Policy and
    consistently with the  constraints  imposed  by  public  law.  For  the
    reasons I have given, the decision of 21 March 2019, read  on  its  own
    and without reference to  the  later  reasons,  was  unlawful  for  two
    reasons. First, because it contained nothing to indicate  that  the  DL
    Policy had been considered at all. Second, because (in  any  event)  it
    gave no reason for departing from the 'normal' position that ILR  would
    be appropriate after 6 years' continuous leave for an applicant  in  Mr
    Ellis's position.

The admissibility of the supplementary letter


46. In Caroopen, at [30]-[33], Underhill LJ identified four  categories  of
    cases in which supplementary reasons, supplied in response to an actual
    or threatened legal challenge, may be relied upon.


47. First, there are the cases in which supplementary reasons are  admitted
    to 'elucidate' reasons previously given. Here, it is important to  bear
    in mind the distinction between reasons which are truly elucidatory and
    those which are wholly new: see the analysis of Stanley  Burnton  J  in
    Nash v Chelsea College of Art and Design [2001] EWHC  538  (Admin),  at
    [27]-[36], distinguishing R v Westminster City Council v Ermakov [1995]
    EWCA civ 42, [1996] 2 All ER 302. As Underhill LJ made clear at [30] of
    Caroopen, however:


         'even in a case where there was no explicit statutory duty to  give
         reasons the courts should approach attempts to rely on subsequently
         provided reasons with caution; and... that was particularly  so  in
         the  case  of  reasons  put  forward  after  the  commencement   of
         proceedings and where important human rights are concerned'.


48. Second, there are cases where supplementary reasons  do  not  cure  any
    defect in the original ones, but constitute a  'fresh  decision'  which
    (if lawful) makes it futile to require reconsideration.  Reference  was
    made to the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan in Kerr v Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2014] UKUT 493 (IAC), in which he had
    quashed  the  original   decision   but   declined   to   require   its
    reconsideration and ordered the applicant her costs up to the  date  of
    the supplementary letter.


49. In the third category are cases where the supplementary reasons  relate
    to material not before the decision-maker at the time when the  earlier
    decision was  taken.  Here,  although  as  a  matter  of  analysis  the
    supplementary  reasons  constitute  a  fresh  decision,   it   may   be
    appropriate to consider this new decision as part of the  challenge  to
    the first: see e.g. R v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  ex
    p. Turgut [2000] EWCA Civ 22, [2001] 1 All ER 719.


50. Fourth, there are cases where the Secretary of State acknowledges  that
    the original decision was flawed but simultaneously makes a new one  to
    the same effect. Here,  although  the  reason  for  reconsideration  is
    different, Underhill LJ held at [33] of Caroopen  that  the  principles
    identified in Turgut should also be applied.


51. Finally, Underhill LJ observed that the four categories  may  often  be
    'blurred in practice' and accepted that it was open to the Secretary of
    State to contend, first,  that  the  original  reasons  were  adequate;
    second, that if not, the new reasons cured the defect; and third,  that
    if that too failed, the new reasons constituted a fresh decision.


52. I turn first to Mr Ostrowski's submission that the reasons given in and
    attached to the letter of 25 November 2019 can be seen  as  elucidating
    those given on 21 March 2019 so as to cure any defect  in  the  latter.
    The covering letter of 25 November  2019  claims  that  '[t]his  letter
    supplements the decision letter of 21 March 2019'.  It  might  be  said
    that, by this formulation, the decision-maker hedged his or her bets as
    to which of the Caroopen categories applied, but he  or  she  certainly
    did not say in terms that the reasons  given  were  an  elucidation  or
    further explanation of those on which the original  decision  was  made
    (rather than fresh reasons constituting a new decision). Nor was  there
    any evidence from the decision-maker, or  anyone  else,  to  assist  in
    identifying the reasons for the original decision. There is also  force
    in Mr Turner's submission that, in  circumstances  where  the  original
    decision gave no reason at all for granting 3  years'  DL  rather  than
    ILR, there was nothing to elucidate, so that any reason given was bound
    to be a new one. In any event,  in  line  with  the  caution  urged  by
    Stanley Burton J in Nash (endorsed by  Underhill  LJ  in  Caroopen),  I
    would in general be very reluctant in a case  such  as  this  to  admit
    reasons proffered for the first time in a document produced  after  the
    grant of permission, contemporaneously with  the  Detailed  Grounds  of
    Defence, when there had been no attempt to produce such reasons  either
    in response to the pre-action correspondence or in the summary  grounds
    contained in the Acknowledgement of Service. I have therefore concluded
    that the reasons contained in and attached to the letter of 25 November
    2019 are not admissible to elucidate or explain  the  reasons  for  the
    earlier decision of 21 March 2019. The latter falls to be considered on
    its own and therefore, for the reasons I have given, was unlawful.


53. The letter of 25 November  2019  (including  the  new  Annex  A)  must,
    therefore, be seen as constituting a fresh decision. It was accompanied
    by the Detailed Grounds of Defence,  which  acknowledged  the  'normal'
    position under ï¿½10.1 of the DL Policy. The cover letter indicated  that
    the decision-maker was prepared  to  grant  limited  DL,  but  'not  to
    exercise discretion to grant settlement'. The new Annex A provided what
    the earlier one had not: a reason for granting limited DL, rather  than
    ILR. The reason was 'the criminality that is detailed  above'.  As  was
    apparent from what was stated 'above', this included not only  the  12-
    month sentence imposed in 2010, which was known about before the  first
    grant of DL in 2011, but also the 4-month sentence for  perverting  the
    course of justice imposed in February 2017, which was a new development
    since Mr Ellis's last application. Read in context, the  reasons  given
    in the 25 November 2019 letter and  the  new  Annex  A,  though  hardly
    impressive, did not give rise to doubt as to whether the DL Policy  had
    been properly applied and  did  supply  a  reason  that  was  logically
    capable of constituting a basis for treating this case as abnormal  for
    the  purposes  of  ï¿½10.1  of  the  DL  Policy.  Although  this  was  an
    application  for  DL   outside   the   Immigration   Rules,   paragraph
    322(1C)(iii) attests to the significance that criminality resulting  in
    a custodial sentence of less than 12 months can have.


54. During the course of the hearing I  raised  the  question  whether  the
    decision of 25 November 2019 could be impugned for  failure  to  comply
    with s. 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009,  to
    which reference is made in ï¿½1.4 of the DL Policy quoted at [18]  above.
    The last part of that passage is of some relevance:


         'Caseworkers must demonstrate they have had regard to  the  child's
         best interests when  considering  the  type  and  length  of  leave
         granted following a decision to grant leave under the DL policy'.


    Ultimately, however, it would in my judgment be wrong to entertain such
    a challenge when it had not been pleaded and was not  within  the  sole
    ground on which permission to proceed was granted. Insofar as it  might
    be said that the failure to consider the impact of the decision  on  Mr
    Ellis's children (or partner)  was  part  and  parcel  of  the  reasons
    challenge, there are two important contextual  factors  which  must  be
    borne in mind. First, it is not immediately obvious what direct  effect
    a decision to grant limited DL (rather  than  ILR)  would  have  on  Mr
    Ellis's two children, who are British citizens. Second, and  relatedly,
    although Mr Ellis mentioned his children and partner on his application
    form (see [7] above), he did so as support for the submission  that  'I
    need to stay in the UK'. The challenged decision allows him to stay  in
    the UK for the time being. There was nothing in what  he  had  said  to
    suggest any particular direct effect on his children or partner of  the
    decision as to the duration of DL to be given. In the circumstances  of
    the case, the effect of the duration decision on  Mr  Ellis's  children
    and partner was not, in  the  language  of  Lord  Brown  in  the  South
    Buckinghamshire case, among the 'main issues  in  the  dispute'.  There
    was, therefore, no duty  to  give  reasons  which  addressed  any  such
    effect.


55. In all the circumstances, I consider that the  letter  of  25  November
    2019, read together with the new  Annex  A,  gave  a  legally  adequate
    reason for concluding that Mr Ellis's case should not be treated  as  a
    'normal' one: namely, his criminality.


56. So, although the later reasons are inadmissible to cure the  defect  in
    the earlier ones, they constitute a fresh decision,  which  is  legally
    valid. This case therefore falls into the second category identified by
    Underhill LJ in Caroopen. It would be futile to require  the  decision-
    maker to retake  the  21  March  2019  decision.  A  similar  situation
    obtained in Kerr, where Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan  decided  that  the
    appropriate course was to quash the first decision but grant no further
    relief. Kerr, however, was decided in  2014,  before  the  coming  into
    force of s. 31(2A) of the Senior Courts  Act  1981,  which  applies  to
    judicial review in  this  Tribunal  by  virtue  of  s.  15(5A)  of  the
    Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. Section 31(2A) requires the
    refusal of relief 'if it appears to the court to be highly likely  that
    the outcome  for  the  applicant  would  not  have  been  substantially
    different if the conduct complained of had not occurred', unless it  is
    appropriate to disregard this requirement 'for reasons  of  exceptional
    public interest' (pursuant to s. 31(2B)).


57. Here, the 'conduct complained of' is the failure, in the light  of  the
    DL Policy, to give adequate reasons in the decision of 21  March  2019.
    Because the later, adequately reasoned decision of 25 November 2019 was
    made by the same decision-maker and had the same outcome, it  is  (now)
    possible to be confident that, but for the conduct complained  of,  the
    outcome would have been the same. Section 31(2A) therefore applies: see
    by analogy R (British Telecommunications plc) v HM Treasury [2018] EWHC
    3251 (Admin), [2019] Pens LR 9,  [199]  (Hamblen  LJ  and  Whipple  J).
    Because this claim raises no issue of exceptional public  interest,  s.
    31(2B) does not apply. It follows that I am required to refuse relief.

Result

58. Although the challenged decision of 21 March 2019 was unlawful, it  has
    been superseded by a fresh decision with the same outcome contained  in
    the letter of 25 November 2019 and its Annex. That decision,  taken  by
    the same decision-maker, was lawful.  Pursuant  to  s.  31(2A)  of  the
    Senior Courts Act 1981, the claim therefore falls to be dismissed.
