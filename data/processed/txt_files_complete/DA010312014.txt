Representation:

For the Appellant:     Unrepresented
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Egypt and his date of birth  is  19  June
    1991.

2.   The Secretary of State made a decision to deport the  appellant  on  30
    May 2014 pursuant to Section 32(5) of the  UK  Borders  Act  2007.   He
    appealed against this decision and his appeal was dismissed by Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Mayall following a hearing on 10 October  2014.
    The decision was promulgated on 12 November 2014.   The  appellant  was
    granted permission to appeal by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P J  G
    White.  Thus the matter came before us.

3.   At the start of the  hearing  the  appellant  made  an  application  to
    adjourn because he had not secured legal representation as a result  of
    lack of funding.  We noted that  the  matter  had  been  listed  on  30
    October 2015 and on  this  occasion  the  Upper  Tribunal  allowed  the
    appellant's application to adjourn, in order  to  enable  him  to  seek
    legal representation.  The appellant informed us that he hoped that  by
    mid-January 2016 he would be put in funds as a result of an inheritance
    which was due to his mother.  He  informed  us  that  his  partner  had
    agreed to give him �1,000 by the end of this month and that he had �500
    available to him. However, he needed  �2,000  to  �3,000  in  order  to
    secure legal representation. In addition  to  the  funding  issue,  his
    mother and partner, were unable  to  attend  the  hearing  for  reasons
    explained in an email that was sent to the Upper Tribunal on 3 December
    2015.

4.   We explained to the appellant that in our view it was in the  interests
    of justice to proceed with the hearing and although we sympathised with
    his position there was no certainty that he would be able to fund legal
    representation by January 2016. The  appellant  has  not  produced  any
    letters  from  his  partner  or  his  mother  confirming   the   future
    availability of funds. We noted that the grounds seeking permission  to
    appeal have been drafted by Counsel  who  represented  him  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The matter had been listed for an  error  of  law
    hearing and it was not necessary for his mother or partner  to  attend.
    However, we indicated to the appellant that if became necessary to hear
    evidence from family members we would agree to  adjourn,  but  that  we
    intended to proceed to consider whether the judge had made an error  of
    law.

5.   The appellant's immigration history can be summarised.  He came to  the
    UK in 2006 aged 15 with  his  mother  and  younger  siblings.   He  was
    granted leave to enter as his mother's dependant until May 2008.   This
    was extended until 5 July  2010.   On  11  June  2010  he  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain.  On 29 October 2013  he  was  convicted  of
    intention to supply class A  and  class  B  drugs  and  he  received  a
    custodial sentence of two years' imprisonment.  As a result of  this  a
    deportation order was made pursuant to paragraph 32(5) of the 2007 Act.


The Decision of the First-Tier Tribunal


6.   The judge  heard  evidence  from  the  appellant,  his  mother  (Salwar
    Elshafey) and his wife (Shahida Shah), whom he married  in  an  Islamic
    ceremony.  It was submitted on his behalf that the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 399 (b) of the Immigration Rules (IR).

7.   The judge made findings at [58]  to  [70]  and  [76]  to  [77].  It  is
    necessary to quote the following paragraphs:

         "60. The fact that the  appellant  still  does  not  recognise  the
             extent of his offending and still  seeks  to  absolve  himself
             from a large portion of the blame,  causes  me  to  doubt  his
             protestations as to his change of heart and lifestyle.  I have
             no OASys Report setting out the risk  of  reoffending  in  the
             Probation Services' view.  The only document  I  have  is  the
             monthly progress report from  the  Home  Office.   Whilst  not
             entirely clear this suggests that his release carries a medium
             risk of public harm.  Later it says that  there  is  a  medium
             risk that he will reoffend and he  is  assessed  as  posing  a
             serious risk of  harm  to  the  public  as  a  result  of  his
             offences.


         61.  On the basis of the evidence before me I  also  consider  that
             there is a medium risk of reoffending in  this  case.   If  he
             does reoffend the risk to the public is of serious  harm  from
             drug dealing and, in particular, in class A drugs.
         ...


         64.  I accept that he has a close relationship with his mother  and
             younger brother.   That  is  to  be  expected.   Although  his
             younger  brother  would,  quite  naturally,  look  up  to  the
             appellant as his older brother, I do  not  consider  that  the
             appellant has been the father figure to  the  younger  brother
             that he makes out.  His use  of  cannabis,  including  in  the
             garden of the house, which he must have known his mother found
             completely unacceptable, does not suggest that he  is  a  good
             role model to the young boy.
         ...
         69.  There was, however, no evidence put before me to suggest  that
             [Ms Shah] would be unable to find employment in Egypt.   There
             was no suggestion that she would face difficulties as a result
             of her ethnicity in Egypt.  Again, I would expect  her  to  be
             able to put into good effect her fluency in  English  and  her
             work experience in the UK.


         70.  Their life together faces severe problems whether in the UK or
             in anywhere else as a result of what I am told is her family's
             probable opposition to this marriage.  It seems unlikely  that
             she would have the support of her family in the UK.
         ...
         78.  As set out above, however, it seems to me that  there  was  no
             evidence to suggest that it would  be  unduly  harsh  for  his
             partner to live in Egypt because of  compelling  circumstances
             over and above those described in paragraph EX.2  of  Appendix
             FM.  That paragraph provides as follows:


                  'EX.1.   This paragraph applies if


                        (b)    the applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting
                             relationship with a partner who is  in  the  UK
                             and is a British Citizen, settled in the UK  or
                             in the UK with refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
                             protection,  and   there   are   insurmountable
                             obstacles to  family  life  with  that  partner
                             continuing outside the UK.


                  EX.2.     For   the   purposes   of   paragraph   EX.1.(b)
                        'insurmountable   obstacles'   means    the    very
                        significant difficulties which would  be  faced  by
                        the applicant or their partner in continuing  their
                        family life together outside the UK and which could
                        not  be  overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious
                        hardship for the applicant or their partner.'


         79.  As stated, whilst it would undoubtedly be  a  wrench  for  the
             partner to leave the UK and forge a new life for  herself  and
             her partner in Egypt, there was nothing before me  to  suggest
             that there were compelling circumstances over  and  above  the
             insurmountable obstacles as defined in EX.2.
         ...
         80.  Furthermore, I bear in mind that this  is  a  relationship  in
             which the purpose of the marriage, as  the  appellant  himself
             said, was to enable them to have sexual  relations  and  still
             remain true to Islamic  principles.   They  have  never  lived
             together.  They both live with their respective  families  (at
             least, so far as the appellant is  concerned,  before  he  was
             imprisoned).  There are no immediate plans to  live  together.
             In these circumstances, even  if  the  appellant  were  to  be
             removed to Egypt and the partner, as she said, were not to  go
             with him, I do not consider that it would be unduly harsh  for
             her to remain in the UK without him.  The  position  would  be
             not a great deal different from what it  is  at  present.   In
             essence, given the limited nature of the  relationship,  I  do
             not consider that it would be unduly harsh for her  to  remain
             in the UK without the appellant.


         81.  To put it in terms of the statute,  I  do  not  consider  that
             exception 2  in  paragraph  117C  applies  because  I  do  not
             consider that the effect on her would be unduly harsh.


         82.   There  is  nothing  exceptional  or  compelling   about   the
             relationship between the appellant and the  remainder  of  his
             family which could possibly bring him within the exceptions in
             the Rules or the Act."


 Conclusions




8.   We heard oral submissions from Mr Duffy and the appellant. We  did  not
    consider the grounds in sequential order. Ground 2 maintains  that  the
    judge failed to consider the evidence relating to risk  of  reoffending
    when he concluded that the appellant posed a medium risk.

9.   There was no OASys Report, printout  of  the  appellant's  convictions,
    PSR or NOMS assessment before the First-tier  Tribunal.   There  was  a
    monthly progress report of  2  October  2014  (B2  of  the  appellant's
    bundle) which indicated that the appellant's release carried  a  medium
    risk of harm  to  the  public.   There  was  an  HDC  pre-release  home
    suitability assessment of 29 July 2014 in which the author had assessed
    the appellant at low risk of harm to the public.

10.  There was a letter from Dr India Beason of 19 September 2014  (C27  and
    C28 of the appellant's  bundle).   Dr  Beason  is  a  volunteer  mentor
    working with the Trailblazers organisation in order to reduce the  risk
    of reoffending amongst young offenders and the  evidence  contained  in
    the letter was that she had had a number of sessions with the appellant
    and her evidence was as follows:

         "The  mere  fact  that  Amr  has  registered  with  the   mentoring
         organisation and engaged positively  during  our  weekly  sessions,
         indicates to me that he is not only a dedicated individual, but  he
         is also committed to reducing the likelihood that he will reoffend.
          His probation officer has also conducted an assessment which shows
         Amr to be at low risk of reoffending."



11.   There  was  no  application  for  an  adjournment  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant in order to obtain the OASys Report, PSR or NOMS  assessment.
    The respondent had failed to comply with directions of the Tribunal  in
    relation to the filing and service of evidence.  At the hearing  before
    us the appellant told us  that  there  was  in  fact  no  PSR  produced
    following his conviction for the trigger offence. He  had  received  an
    immediate custodial sentence, the judge having considered  a  PSR  that
    had been prepared in relation to an earlier conviction for the  offence
    of perverting the course  of  justice.  He  had  received  a  suspended
    sentence for this.  There was no list of  previous  convictions  before
    the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  judge  was  not  aware  of  any  other
    convictions and no other convictions  have  been  relied  upon  by  the
    Secretary of State.

12.  Mr Duffy in oral submissions accepted that the monthly progress  report
    was not a reliable assessment of risk, but submitted that the judge was
    entitled to make his own assessment on the evidence before him  and  he
    was entitled to take into account the appellant's evidence in  relation
    to the offence. The finding in relation to  the  appellant  having  not
    accepted responsibility was  one  that  was  open  to  the  judge.   In
    addition the judge was entitled to conclude that drug-dealing puts  the
    public at risk of serious harm.

13.  It would have been preferable in our view for the  judge  to  have  had
    before him a  proper  assessment  of  risk  conducted  by  a  probation
    officer.  However, the judge was entitled to proceed without  this  and
    to make an assessment on the evidence before him.  The  judge  made  no
    reference to the correspondence  from  Trailblazers  in  his  decision.
    However, it is clear from [11] and  [20]  that  he  was  aware  of  the
    appellant's evidence in relation to Trailblazers  and  that  he  had  a
    volunteer mentor. The weight to attach to the evidence  of  the  letter
    was a matter for the judge in the context  of  all  the  evidence.  The
    judge took into account the sentencing remarks by the Crown Court Judge
    which were not consistent with the appellant's evidence in  respect  of
    his involvement in the offence and it was open to the judge to  take  a
    dim view of this. We note  that  the  judge  sentencing  the  appellant
    concluded that he had a significant role in the offence considering the
    texts which were discovered on one of the mobile phones  and  the  drug
    dealing paraphernalia found in his possession.

14.  We conclude that it was open to the judge to assess risk on  the  basis
    of the evidence before him. We conclude that the judge did not rely  on
    the monthly progress report, but on the appellant's oral  evidence  and
    the sentencing remarks. The weight to attach  to  the  letter  from  Dr
    Beason was a matter for the judge.  The  assessment  of  risk  was  not
    flawed. We will consider the materiality, should be wrong  about  this,
    later in our decision.

15.   Ground 3 asserts that the judge did  not  consider  the  correct  test
    under Section 117 C (5) of the 2002 Act.  The relevant part of  Section
    117 (C) reads as follows;

                ...


                (3)    In the case of a foreign criminal ('C') who  has  not
                    been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years
                    or more, the public interest  requires  C's  deportation
                    unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.


                (5)    Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and
                    subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or  a
                    genuine and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a
                    qualifying child, and the effect of C's  deportation  on
                    the partner or child would be unduly harsh."

16.  The basis of this submission is that the judge imported  an  additional
    test which  is  not  in  Section  117C  (5)  at  [79]  namely  that  of
    "compelling circumstances over and above..." However, there is no merit
    in this assertion.  At [79] the judge considers paragraph 399(b) of the
    IR which reads;

         "399.    This paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
             applies if -


             (b)  the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
                  a partner who is in the UK and is  a  British  Citizen  or
                  settled in the UK, and


                  (i)  the relationship was formed at a time when the person
                      (deportee)  was  in  the  UK   lawfully   and   their
                      immigration status was not precarious; and


                  (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live  in
                      the country to which the person is  to  be  deported,
                      because of compelling circumstances  over  and  above
                      those described in paragraph EX.2.  of  Appendix  FM;
                      and


                  (iii)    it would be unduly  harsh  for  that  partner  to
                      remain in the UK without the  person  who  is  to  be
                      deported."


17.  At  [79]  the  judge  properly  considered  the  appeal  under  the  IR
    (paragraph  399  (b)  (ii)).   Section  117C  (5)  does  not  refer  to
    compelling circumstances, but the impact of deportation on the  partner
    (or child). The IR do not  import  a  more  stringent  test  than  that
    enshrined in primary legislation.  The IR at  paragraph  399  (b)  (ii)
    simply seek to distinguish insurmountable obstacles from  unduly  harsh
    and to inform us that the latter is a  more  stringent  test.   In  any
    event, whether or not the judge properly applied the test in  paragraph
    399 (b) (ii) is not material, because he found that the appellant could
    not meet paragraph 399 (b) (iii). Thus the appeal fell to be  dismissed
    under the IR in any event.  We conclude, for  the  reasons  we  explain
    below, that this finding was open to the  judge  and  grounded  in  the
    evidence.

18.  The judge's assessment of unduly harsh was sufficiently  comprehensive.
     He conducted an assessment in accordance with MAB (para  399;  "unduly
    harsh") USA [2015] UKUT 00435.  The grounds assert that  he  failed  to
    consider unduly harsh in the context of Ms Shah's  family's  opposition
    to relocation, but there is no merit in this.  What the judge found  at
    [70] is that her family oppose the marriage whether she is in the UK or
    in  Egypt.   There  was  no  persuasive  evidence  that  the   family's
    disapproval would be a bar to relocation. It had  not  been  a  bar  to
    their marriage.

19.  We have considered [69] of the judge's decision  and  conclude  that  a
    language problem would not be sufficient to establish  that  relocation
    would be unduly harsh.

20.   The finding of the judge at [80] is not perverse. It was open  to  the
    judge to consider the quality of the marriage and conclude that it  was
    lacking in maturity and depth.   This  is  not  inconsistent  with  the
    finding that the marriage was genuine and subsisting.

21.  We now turn to ground 1. Contrary to the assertion  contained  therein,
    the IR are a complete code in respect of deportation.  Having concluded
    that the appellant could not meet paragraph 399 it was incumbent on him
    to consider 398. This reads as follows;

         "398.    Where a person claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
             contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the  Human
             Rights Convention, and


             (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                  the public good and in the public  interest  because  they
                  have been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;


             (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                  the public good and in the public  interest  because  they
                  have been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years
                  but at least 12 months; or


             (c)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                  the public good and in the public interest because, in the
                  view of the Secretary of State, their offending has caused
                  serious harm or they are a persistent offender who shows a
                  particular disregard for the law, the Secretary  of  State
                  in assessing that claim will  consider  whether  paragraph
                  399 or 399A applies  and,  if  it  does  not,  the  public
                  interest in deportation will only be outweighed  by  other
                  factors where there are very compelling circumstances over
                  and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A."

22.  At [82] the judge considered paragraph 398.  The paragraph is  succinct
    and if one is  to  consider  it  in  isolation  the  finding  could  be
    considered inadequately reasoned; however, it must be considered in the
    context of the decision as a  whole.  It  is  clear  from  the  judge's
    findings  generally  that  there  were  no  compelling   circumstances,
    identified by the appellant's representatives at the hearing, over  and
    above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

23.    We gave the appellant the opportunity to address us in  some  detail.
    He told us what he thought the judge had not taken into account, but we
    were satisfied that the judge properly assessed the evidence.  Both the
    appellant's mother and his brother produced statements of evidence.  It
    is clear that they both want the appellant to stay in the UK  and  that
    their relationship with him is close, but the grounds do  not  disclose
    that the judge failed to take account of this evidence. The judge  took
    into account the impact of deportation on them. He  accepted  that  the
    appellant's relationship with both was close, but  he  did  not  accept
    that his relationship with his brother was akin to that of  father  and
    son.

24.  Ground 4 maintains that the  judge  did  not  follow  the  guidance  in
    Maslov v Austria [2008] ECHR 246 and he  misunderstood  Akpinar  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 937. The judge did not misunderstand  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    decision in Akpinar (see [73]) and he  did  not  misdirect  himself  in
    relation to it or the case of Maslov.  The appellant in this  case  was
    not a juvenile, but an adult when he committed the offence and  he  has
    not spent most of his childhood here.  It was incumbent on the judge to
    consider the appellant's Article 8 claim through the lens of the  Rules
    and the 2002 Act.

25.  We have taken  into  account  the  case  of  Balogun  (Application  no.
    60286/09) which Mr Duffy relied on at the hearing before us. We  accept
    that the  appellant's  circumstances  can  be  distinguished  from  the
    appellant in Balogun.  However, there is no error of law in judgment of
    the judge and he was not obliged to identify very  serious  reasons  to
    justify the appellant's expulsion. He gave sufficient  weight,  in  our
    view, to the appellant's immigration history, but he  was  entitled  to
    consider that this did not amount  compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above those in 399 or 399A.

26.  We now return to the assessment of  risk  and  whether,  if  the  judge
    erred in his assessment of risk whether this  would  be  material.  The
    judge considered unduly harsh in the  context  of  the  impact  on  the
    appellant's wife without conducting an assessment of the  wider  public
    interest.  He therefore preferred the approach of the Upper Tribunal in
    MAB (para 399; "unduly harsh") USA [2015] UKUT 00435 rather  than  that
    in KMO (section 117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT  00543.   There
    is no challenge to this in the appellant's  grounds  and  there  is  no
    cross-challenge by the respondent. In the light of this we  cannot  see
    how the risk of offending would impact  on  the  assessment  of  unduly
    harsh.  Had the judge  considered  unduly  harsh  taking  into  account
    public interest considerations, it would  not  in  this  case,  make  a
    material difference to the outcome whether there was a  low  or  medium
    risk. Indeed it would only  have  served  to  make  matters  even  more
    difficult for the appellant as it would present further hurdles in  the
    light of Section 117 C (1) and (2). The risk of reoffending is only one
    facet of the public interest and in the case of very serious crimes not
    the most important facet.  The appellant has, by any account, committed
    a very serious crime and deterrence and public revulsion are  important
    considerations which apply here.

27.    The appellants appeal is dismissed. There is  no  material  error  of
    law and the decision of Judge Mayall is maintained.
