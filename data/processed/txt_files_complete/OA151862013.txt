Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Rahman, Legal Representative, instructed by
                    Jalalabad Law Associates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Mrs Nesa is a citizen of Bangladesh and I shall refer  to  her  as  the
    claimant.  She applied for entry clearance as a partner under  Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules and her  application  was  refused  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) and again by the Entry Clearance  Manager
    (ECM) although there was a concession in connection  with  the  English
    language test.  However, in respect of the financial  requirements  the
    ECM maintained the decision and the claimant's  subsequent  appeal  was
    allowed by Judge T Jones in a decision dated 11th November 2014.

 2. The grounds of application set out that the judge had no regard to  the
    Rules on specified evidence as set out in Appendix  FM-SE  and  it  was
    clear that the Appellant could not meet the requirements of Appendix FM-
    SE for the six month period prior to the date  of  application.   Given
    that these were mandatory requirements it is said  that  the  Appellant
    cannot succeed under the Rules. It was said that when the  Sponsor  was
    paid in cash for the gross income to be taken into account all of those
    monies received from employment must be paid directly into the bank and
    this was a mandatory requirement.  The sums paid by the Sponsor varied,
    ranging between �15,080 at the very  least  and  �18,720  at  its  very
    highest.  Given that the deposits at  their  highest  point  were  only
    slightly above the threshold it was reasonably likely that the  Sponsor
    had not deposited sufficient  income  over  the  six  month  period  to
    demonstrate the financial requirements were met.

 3. The grounds were found to be arguable and permission to appeal granted.
    Thus the matter came before me on the above date.

 4. For the Home Office Mr Melvin submitted that the judge had  misdirected
    himself in law.  There was  insufficient  evidence  to  show  that  the
    Appellant had complied with the necessary  requirements.  As  such  the
    decision should be set aside and a fresh decision made  dismissing  the
    appeal.

 5. For the claimant Mr Rahman relied on his skeleton argument. Therein  it
    is said that the crux of the judge's  conclusion  was  at  paragraph  9
    where he noted that it was unfortunate cash was  paid  to  him  but  he
    accepted that the Sponsor would not pay all of the cash into  the  bank
    but keep  day-to-day  living  expenses  in  his  pocket.  The  skeleton
    argument narrates that this was not likely to happen on any commonsense
    view where the wages are not going directly and  automatically  into  a
    bank account.  If they  are  paid  cash  in  hand  the  employee  would
    sometimes  put  in  more  and  sometimes  put  in   less.    In   these
    circumstances the judge had allowed the appeal and that conclusion must
    be right in law.

 6. Mr Rahman accepted that, as stated in the grounds  of  application  and
    the refusal notice, the specified documents had  not  been  lodged  but
    maintained that the judge was entitled to look at all the circumstances
    and had been correct to allow the appeal.  It  was  important  to  note
    that in paragraph 9 of the decision the judge had  noted  a  concession
    from the Presenting Officer that the Appellant was paid  in  cash.   In
    all the circumstances Mr Rahman indicated that there  was  no  material
    error in law and the decision should stand.

 7. I reserved my decision.

Conclusions

 8. As the grounds of application say, the Rules on specified evidence  are
    comprehensively set out in Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE of the Rules.
     The Rules are strict and prescriptive.  They do not allow for any near
    miss.  An Appellant  must meet those requirements.   As  noted  by  the
    ECO, and unchallenged  before  me,  the  total  cash  payments  in  the
    qualifying six month period shown from 4th August 2012 to 4th  February
    2013 were payments of �8,900 giving  an  equivalent  annual  income  of
    �17,800.  It is true as Mr Rahman pointed out  that  as  noted  in  the
    rules under Appendix FM -SE A1. (m)  that  cash  income  on  which  the
    correct tax has been paid may be counted as income under  the  Appendix
    but as the rule says   that  is  subject  to  the  relevant  evidential
    requirements of the Appendix.  Payslips covering a period of six months
    prior to the date of application must be provided.

 9. The judge appears to be relying on what was the P60 for  2012/13  which
    suggested a shortfall which the judge found was made  up  by  the  cash
    payments.  Even if that is so, that does not come close to meeting  the
    specified document test set out in Appendix FM-SE. As stated Mr  Rahman
    did not attempt to argue that it did but did argue that the  judge  was
    entitled to look at all the evidence placed before him and on the basis
    of that go on and allow the appeal.

10. However the case law consistently tells us that this  approach  is  not
    permissible.  Unless the Appellant meets the  precise  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE the appeal  cannot  be  allowed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules. Unfortunately for the Appellant there is no scope for judges  to
    be satisfied by evidence not of a nature specified in the  rules  which
    appears to have been the position adopted by Judge Jones.

11. The Appellant does not argue that the Secretary of  State  should  have
    exercised her discretion differently in terms of paragraph 245AA of the
    Rules and no human rights  argument  has  been  presented.   Given  the
    acknowledged  failure  of  the  Appellant  to  produce  the   necessary
    documentation under the Rules there is a material error in law  in  the
    decision of Judge Jones which must be set aside and  a  fresh  decision
    substituted dismissing the appeal. There is no need  for  an  anonymity
    order.

Notice of Decision

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

13. I set aside the decision.

14. I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.
