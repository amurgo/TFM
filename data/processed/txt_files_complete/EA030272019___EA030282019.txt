                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 3 September 2020 the Upper Tribunal found an error  of  law  in  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Traynor issued on 31 January 2020
    and set aside that decision to be remade in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The parties have now provided a signed consent order dated 4  September
    2020 indicating agreement that either the appeals should  be  withdrawn
    or allowed  where  the  respondent  accepts  that  the  appellants  are
    entitled to EEA residence cards reflecting their right to  reside.  The
    Tribunal follows the latter disposal, allowing the appeal.



Notice of Decision

 3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal disclosed an error on  a  point
    of law and was set aside to be remade.

 4. The appeal under the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    is allowed.
