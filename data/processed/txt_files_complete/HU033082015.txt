                            DECISION AND REASONS


      The Appellant

   1. The Appellant is a citizen of Ghana born on 14th  December  1984.  She
      appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 13th July 2015  to
      refuse to grant her leave to remain. Her appeal was allowed  by  Judge
      of the First Tier Tribunal Cohen sitting at Taylor House on 27th  June
      2016. The Respondent appeals with leave against that decision and  for
      the reasons which I set out in more detail below (see paragraph 11)  I
      have set aside the decision of the First-Tier and re-heard the appeal.
      I therefore continue to refer to the parties as  they  were  known  at
      first instance for the sake of convenience.

   2. The Appellant  entered  the  United  Kingdom  in  2003  with  a  valid
      visitor's Visa. Before this expired she applied for leave to remain on
      the grounds of family/private life but this was  refused  on  2  April
      2014 with no right of appeal. The Appellant thereafter had no leave to
      remain in this country. On 13th of  July  2015  she  was  served  with
      illegal entrant papers following the Respondent's  decision  which  is
      the subject matter of this appeal.

   3. The basis of the  Appellant's  application  was  that  she  was  in  a
      relationship with a British citizen Mr Lewis  Foster  ("the  Sponsor")
      with whom she had had a customary marriage and also a  marriage  in  a
      Baptist church although  that  church  was  not  authorised  to  issue
      marriage certificates. The relationship itself  was  accepted  by  the
      First-Tier Judge as  being  genuine  and  subsisting  and  the  appeal
      proceeds  on  that  basis.  The  Appellant  argued  that  there   were
      insurmountable obstacles to the Sponsor travelling to Ghana with  her,
      a country which he had never visited and where he would find  it  very
      difficult to obtain a  job.  The  Sponsor's  father  was  admitted  to
      hospital because of serious health problems and the Sponsor's presence
      in the United Kingdom was  necessary  to  care  for  his  father.  The
      Appellant's parents and her six siblings all lived  in  a  one-bedroom
      house in Ghana. The Appellant and Sponsor sent them  money  when  they
      could.

   4. The Respondent refused the application because the Appellant  had  not
      provided evidence of a valid marriage certificate. The  Appellant  had
      submitted a customary marriage certificate and also  evidence  of  her
      marriage to the Sponsor in a Baptist church but that  church  was  not
      authorised to grant official marriage certificates. The Appellant  had
      failed to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating that  there  would
      be very significant obstacles to her  reintegration  back  into  Ghana
      considering  the  length  of  time  she  had  spent  in  Ghana  before
      travelling  to  the  United  Kingdom.  There   were   no   exceptional
      circumstances warranting the Appellant being granted leave  to  remain
      in the United Kingdom outside of the Immigration Rules.

      The Decision at First Instance

   5. The Judge who heard oral evidence from both the Appellant and  Sponsor
      found at paragraph 18 of the determination that the Appellant's appeal
      under the human rights provisions as incorporated into the Immigration
      Rules was bound to fail. Although no formal notice of cross-appeal has
      been submitted to the Upper Tribunal that that finding  is  challenged
      by the Appellant I permitted argument on the point. I deal  with  that
      issue in more detail below. At paragraphs 23 to 27 the Judge gave  his
      reasons why he found the interference with the Appellant's family  and
      private  life  resulting  from  the  Respondent's   decision   to   be
      disproportionate. He wrote:
              "The Sponsor has a good job in the UK and I find  that  he  is
         capable of maintaining and accommodating the Appellant  in  the  UK
         without recourse to public funds. The Appellant and Sponsor met  in
         church and I find that they have strong links with their church and
         community in the UK. Based upon the Appellant living in the UK  for
         13 years and the very poor circumstances in which  her  family  are
         living in Ghana, I find that the Appellant has tantamount  to  lost
         all connections with Ghana. Based upon the circumstances concerning
         the parties academic and employment history, I find that they would
         not be able to support themselves in Ghana if removed from the UK."




         The Judge found that allowing the Appellant and Sponsor to  remain
      in the United Kingdom provided taxable income to support  the  economy
      and provided social care to elderly  parents  and  grandparents  which
      would otherwise fall on the public  purse.  The  Appellant's  negative
      immigration history did not outweigh these factors.

      The Onward Appeal

   6. The Respondent appealed against  that  decision  arguing  that  having
      found the Appellant's appeal failed under  the  Rules  the  Judge  had
      embarked on a  free  standing  Article  8  proportionality  assessment
      allowing the appeal without considering whether there were  compelling
      circumstances which led the Judge to consider  the  situation  outside
      the Rules. The proportionality assessment undertaken by the Judge  was
      wholly inadequate in its reasoning as the Judge had  not  referred  to
      section 117 B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The
      Judge had failed to direct himself that little weight should be  given
      to a private life or a relationship with a qualifying partner that  is
      established when a person is in the  United  Kingdom  unlawfully.  The
      Appellant had entered the United Kingdom in 2003 but  overstayed.  The
      Judge's  finding  that  the  Appellant  had  tantamount  to  lost  all
      connections with Ghana  was  inconsistent  with  the  Appellant's  own
      evidence that her parents and 6 siblings were still in Ghana and  that
      she supported them  financially  when  she  could.  This  finding  too
      undermined the Judge's proportionality assessment.

   7. The application for permission to appeal came  on  the  papers  before
      First -Tier Tribunal Judge Holmes on 28th of  October  2016.  Granting
      permission to  appeal  he  wrote:  "the  Appellant  accepted  in  oral
      evidence that her parents and 6 siblings remained in  Ghana  and  that
      she supported them when she could. The finding that she had no ties to
      Ghana would  in  those  circumstances  arguably  meet  the  perversity
      threshold; Miftari. The Appellant  was  present  unlawfully  when  she
      formed a relationship she relied upon and indeed has been since  2003.
      It is well arguable that the Judge's approach to section 117  A-D  was
      flawed, not least because there  is  no  reference  to  the  statutory
      provisions or the relevant jurisprudence in the decision".
   The Error of Law Stage

   8. As a result of this grant the  matter  came  before  me  to  determine
      whether in the first place there was a material error of  law  in  the
      first instance decision. If there was then that decision would be  set
      aside and I would re-determine the matter. I  heard  submissions  from
      both representatives. For the Respondent the Presenting Officer argued
      that the grounds were succinct but clear. The Appellant's  application
      was one that was bound to fail. The Judge had  carried  out  a  Razgar
      assessment  but  had  failed  to  take  into  account  the   statutory
      provisions in section 117 A-D. There were no insurmountable  obstacles
      to relocation.

   9. For the Appellant it was argued that the grounds of onward appeal were
      wrong in suggesting that the Judge should consider whether there  were
      compelling circumstances before going on  to  consider  the  situation
      outside the Rules. What  had  happened  in  this  case  was  that  the
      Respondent had conflated the private and family life  claim  when  the
      crux of the appeal was the Appellant's  relationship  with  a  British
      citizen. The Judge had not made a fee award in this case because a lot
      of the evidence had been  produced  at  the  hearing.  The  issue  was
      whether the Appellant could satisfy the provisions of section  EX.  1.
      The Sponsor's job was based on the amount of time he had been  working
      for his company but he would be unable to replicate that in Ghana.  In
      any event if the Appellant met the Rules the proportionality  exercise
      (which would involve a consideration of section 117 B)  did  not  come
      into  play.  Although  the  Respondent  argued  that  the  Appellant's
      relationship with the Sponsor began when she was here  unlawfully  and
      thus little weight could be afforded to it there were factors  in  the
      Appellant's favour. There would be no cost to  the  public  purse  for
      example.

  10. In response the Presenting Officer indicated that he relied  upon  the
      case of Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 74 which approved an earlier decision of
      Nagre that the main points for consideration in relation to Article  8
      will be addressed by decision-makers applying the  new  Rules.  It  is
      only if after doing that that there  remains  an  arguable  case  that
      there may be good grounds for granting leave  to  remain  outside  the
      Rules by reference to Article 8 that it will be necessary for  Article
      8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
      circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the new Rules to grant
      such leave. The case of Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440 defined  what  was
      meant  by  insurmountable  obstacles.  In  this  case  it   would   be
      appropriate for the Appellant to go back to Ghana to apply  for  entry
      clearance from there. In response counsel  for  the  Appellant  argued
      that nothing turned on the ratio in Singh.

  11. At the conclusion of these arguments I indicated to the parties that I
      found a material error of law in the first instance decision such that
      it felt to be set aside. The Judge had not looked  at  the  Article  8
      claim through the prism of the Rules as he was required to do. He  had
      made no mention of  the  statutory  provisions  which  appertained.  I
      considered the Upper Tribunal authority of Foreman [2015] UKUT 412. It
      was not possible in this case for the loser to understand why they had
      lost as the problem was not  that  the  Judge  had  merely  failed  to
      mention the statutory provisions but nevertheless applied them  rather
      that there was no indication from the determination that the statutory
      provisions  had  been  considered  or  applied  at  all.  I  therefore
      indicated that the matter would proceed to a rehearing.  After  taking
      instructions Counsel for the Appellant indicated that he would not  be
      seeking to submit any further evidence but would rely  on  submissions
      only. I indicated that even though there was no cross-appeal  I  would
      permit further submissions on the Appellant's argument that she had in
      fact satisfied the Immigration Rules in relation to her claim to  stay
      here with a partner and thus the Judge had not  needed  to  go  on  to
      consider Article 8 outside the Rules. The rehearing would  proceed  on
      the basis of the findings of fact made by the Judge at first  instance
      although not necessarily the  conclusions  or  inferences  drawn  from
      those facts.

      The Rehearing

  12. Counsel for the Appellant argued that since the Judge had found  there
      was a genuine and subsisting relationship between  the  Appellant  and
      the Sponsor the issue was whether the Appellant  could  succeed  under
      the Rules, that is to say whether there were insurmountable  obstacles
      to family life being continued in Ghana. Unlike in the case of Agyarko
      there were other factors which posed difficulties for the Sponsor such
      as the social care he was providing which otherwise would fall on  the
      public purse. The Sponsor earned between �1600 and  �1800  per  month.
      Looking at the matter outside the Rules Article 8 (1) was engaged  and
      therefore one looked at the factors under section 117B. The  Appellant
      spoke English and was not a burden on the state as she  was  supported
      by the Sponsor. It was  acknowledged  that  subparagraph  (4)  of  the
      section meant that little weight could  be  given  to  a  relationship
      formed whilst the Appellant was here unlawfully but one had to look at
      all the circumstances. The parties have  been  together  more  than  2
      years and the public interest test was therefore met.

  13. For the Respondent  the  Presenting  Officer  commented  that  he  had
      already made the majority of his  submissions  at  the  error  of  law
      stage. The Sponsor had 6 siblings in the United Kingdom including  one
      who was living with the  Sponsor's  father  therefore  there  will  be
      someone to take care of the father. In any event the Judge had had  no
      specific medical evidence of the father's  needs.  There  was  someone
      besides the Sponsor who could take care of the Sponsor's father in the
      United Kingdom. That the Sponsor had not been to Ghana  before  as  an
      objection to relocation was now settled by the case of Agyarko against
      the Appellant. The Appellant could not be  deemed  to  be  financially
      independent as she was  dependent  on  the  Sponsor.  There  would  be
      nothing to prevent the Sponsor from obtaining reasonable employment in
      Ghana. In any event the Appellant could return for a short  period  to
      apply for entry clearance from there. Although the Presenting  Officer
      did not have the facts and figures on consideration of applications to
      hand, they were available publicly on the UKBA website.  The  majority
      of applications were considered by entry clearance officers  in  Ghana
      within one month and 100% within 60 days.

  14. Finally, for the Appellant it was commented that  there  had  been  no
      evidence in  Agyarko  to  substantiate  the  claim  of  insurmountable
      obstacles but that was not the case  here.  The  Sponsor  was  looking
      after his grandfather because he was the only one who could drive.  It
      was difficult to see how the Appellant could survive in Ghana  and  it
      was disproportionate to make her return.

      Findings

  15. I consider first the Appellant's argument  that  she  is  entitled  to
      succeed under the Rules because the Judge found  that  she  was  in  a
      genuine and subsisting relationship with the Sponsor. The  application
      was refused by the Respondent because it was  not  accepted  that  the
      Appellant and Sponsor were in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship.
      The Sponsor was a British citizen present and settled  in  the  United
      Kingdom but section E-LTRP. 2. 1. prescribed  that  an  applicant  for
      leave to remain on the basis of family life as a partner could not  be
      in the United Kingdom as a visitor or with valid leave for less than 6
      months or on temporary admission or temporary release  unless  section
      EX. 1. (b) applied. This provided that the Appellant had to show there
      were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  the   Sponsor
      continuing outside the United Kingdom. Insurmountable obstacles  meant
      very significant difficulties which  would  be  faced  by  either  the
      Appellant or the Sponsor in  continuing  their  family  life  together
      outside the United Kingdom and which could not be  overcome  or  would
      entail very serious hardship for the Appellant or the Sponsor.


  16. The difficulty with the Judge's consideration of section EX.1 was that
      he  proceeded  to  consider  it  (at  paragraphs  16  and  17  of  the
      determination) as it related to the Appellant's private life claim. As
      was submitted to me by Counsel for  the  Appellant  the  private  life
      aspect of the claim was not the crux of the matter. What was important
      was the family life claim and this the Judge did  not  consider  under
      the Rules. Before one could properly look at  this  case  outside  the
      Rules one had to properly look at it within the  Rules.  The  question
      then arose as to  whether  the  Appellant  could  show  insurmountable
      obstacles to family life  with  the  Sponsor  continuing  outside  the
      United Kingdom. If she could then she could succeed  under  the  Rules
      section EX.1. Whilst the Judge did indicate a number of  problems  for
      the couple in the event that they were required to relocate he did not
      look at those difficulties in the light of whether they were  or  were
      not insurmountable obstacles rather he looked at them in his Article 8
      exercise  outside  the  Rules  as  to  whether  the  interference  was
      sufficiently serious to make the decision disproportionate.  That  was
      the wrong test.

  17. I do not accept the attempt made to distinguish the  case  of  Agyarko
      from the facts in this case. Whilst  the  Sponsor  has  no  particular
      qualifications, he has shown  a  capacity  for  hard  work  which  has
      enabled him to progress with his employer. He would be able  to  bring
      that skill to bear if required to relocate  with  the  Appellant.  The
      Appellant would have no difficulties, on the  evidence  that  was  put
      before the First -Tier, in being able to relocate to Ghana. Her family
      live there and there is no particular reason why they could not assist
      her and the Sponsor in setting up home in the Appellant's  country  of
      origin. Whilst the Appellant's family's accommodation appears somewhat
      overcrowded, that of itself does not prevent the Appellant and Sponsor
      from finding their own accommodation. That the Appellant  and  Sponsor
      sent money to the appellant's family as and when they could was  clear
      evidence of continuing contacts and links with Ghana contrary  to  the
      Judge's assessment of that evidence.


  18. A further difficulty  in  relocation  was  said  to  be  the  problems
      concerning the Sponsor's father but as was  submitted  to  me  on  the
      evidence that the Judge received  there  were  other  members  of  the
      Sponsor's family present in the United Kingdom. Whilst the Judge found
      as a fact that the Sponsor was taking responsibility  for  parents  or
      grandparents the Judge appears not to have received  any  evidence  to
      indicate no one  else  could.  What  the  Judge  found  was  that  the
      obligations of the Sponsor meant  that  he  could  not  accompany  the
      Appellant to Ghana even whilst the Appellant submitted application for
      entry clearance. As I have indicated I do not think that  that  was  a
      correct inference for the Judge to draw from the facts before him.  In
      any event given what appears to  be  the  case  that  entry  clearance
      applications are  decided  within  a  relatively  short  time,  it  is
      difficult to see why the Appellant could not return  to  Ghana  for  a
      short period to make  an  application  for  entry  clearance  with  or
      without the Sponsor.

  19. I do not find on the facts before the Judge that the  Appellant  could
      establish there were insurmountable obstacles either  to  the  parties
      continuing their  relationship  outside  the  United  Kingdom  or  the
      Appellant returning to Ghana for a short period to make an application
      from there. In considering the issue of  a  temporary  return  I  have
      considered whether this is a case where  it  is  so  obvious  that  an
      application for entry clearance would succeed that no  useful  purpose
      would be served by requiring the Appellant to return to go through the
      formalities of entry clearance. The evidence appears to  be  that  the
      Sponsor satisfies the  financial  criteria  in  Appendix  FM  and  the
      parties are in a genuine and subsisting  relationship  but  given  the
      Appellant's poor immigration record it is not I find so  certain  that
      entry clearance would be granted  that  the  requirement  for  her  to
      return could be dispensed with.

  20. For different reasons to those given by the Judge at first instance  I
      come nevertheless to the same conclusion  that  the  Appellant  cannot
      satisfy the Immigration Rules. To succeed in this appeal, she must  be
      able to show that there are compelling circumstances  such  that  this
      appeal should be allowed outside the Rules. The Appellant and  Sponsor
      have established a family life together in this country and  it  would
      be interfered with either by requiring  the  Appellant  to  return  to
      apply for entry clearance from Ghana or by requiring the Appellant and
      Sponsor to relocate permanently there. That interference would  be  in
      accordance with the legitimate aim of immigration  control  since  the
      Appellant has been in this country for several years now  without  any
      form of leave  and  is  an  overstayer.  The  issue  is  thus  one  of
      proportionality and in considering that I bear in mind the factors set
      out in the statute. The Appellant established  her  relationship  with
      the Sponsor at a time when she  was  present  in  the  United  Kingdom
      unlawfully. By virtue of subsection (4) to section 117 B little weight
      should be given to that relationship. Given my findings that there are
      no insurmountable obstacles to the relationship continuing outside the
      United Kingdom and given that little weight is to be afforded to  that
      relationship in the proportionality exercise, it is very difficult  to
      see how the Appellant's appeal could succeed in this case.  Whilst  it
      is correct that the Appellant can speak English and even if I were  to
      accept the argument that she is financially independent these are  not
      positive factors to advance her case. Their significance  is  if  they
      are negative factors which  might  adversely  affect  the  Appellant's
      case. In short they do not assist the Appellant. The Appellant  cannot
      show in my view compelling circumstances  why  her  appeal  should  be
      allowed outside the Rules in relation to her claim for family life.


  21.  I have not dealt  in  this  determination  in  any  detail  with  the
      Appellant's claim to have established a private life  which  would  be
      disproportionately interfered with. As will be seen from my summary of
      the submissions made to me the claim under  a  private  life  was  not
      advanced with any force. The Appellant is here unlawfully  and  little
      weight can be afforded to that private life. That  the  Appellant  has
      been here several years means that she has established a private  life
      of sorts but again the legitimate aim  of  immigration  control  means
      that the interference with that private life is for a lawful  purpose.
      The little weight to be attached to her private life  cannot  outweigh
      the substantial weight on the Respondent's side of  the  scales  given
      the poor immigration record of the Appellant. I therefore dismiss  the
      Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to  refuse  leave
      to remain.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First -Tier tribunal involved the making of  a  material
error of law. I  have  therefore  set  it  aside  and  substitute  for  that
decision a decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

Appellant's appeal dismissed

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
