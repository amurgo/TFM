For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                                   NOTICE

 1.  On  the  19th  May  2014  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  M  Symes)
    promulgated a determination purporting to be the decision in an  appeal
    lodged by Mr Ahmed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State  to
    refuse to issue him with certificate of entitlement.


 2. In fact no such appeal was before the  Tribunal,  since  Mr  Ahmed  had
    given notice that he withdrawn his appeal four days before  the  matter
    was listed before Judge Symes.   The determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is therefore a nullity and should be disregarded.
