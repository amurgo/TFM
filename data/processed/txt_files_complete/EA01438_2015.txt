Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Z Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr K Siaw, Solicitor from R Spio & Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to  the  parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Therefore the Secretary of State is the  Respondent  and  Mrs
    Owusu-Amponsah is once more the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Plumptre (the judge), promulgated on 14  November  2016,
    in which she allowed the Appellant's appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    decision of 28 September 2015, refusing to issue a permanent  residence
    card under the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006
    (the Regulations).  The Appellant has at all times been  married  to  a
    Dutch national.

 3. By an application made on 18 April 2015, the  Appellant  asserted  that
    she had by that point acquired a permanent right of residence  pursuant
    to Regulation 15 of the Regulations.  In refusing the  application  the
    Respondent had asserted that there  was  no  evidence  that  the  Dutch
    national had been a qualified person within the meaning of Regulation 6
    for the requisite period of five years.




The judge's decision

 4. The judge found that the Dutch national had in fact worked  from  March
    2009 to May 2010 (I will return to the end  date  of  this  employment,
    below).  She found that he had been working since 27 November  2013  to
    the date of the hearing before her in October 2016.  In relation to the
    interim period 2010 to 2013, the judge found that he had been  claiming
    jobseeker's allowance.  The judge found that  the  Dutch  national  had
    always intended to find employment after being made redundant from  his
    previous job, and in order to enhance his prospects  had  undertaken  a
    number of courses.  The judge clearly found the Dutch national to be  a
    credible witness.  Having referred to various aspects of  the  evidence
    and relevant case  law  from  the  Administrative  Appeals  Chamber  in
    relation to  the  meaning  of  the  phrase  "genuine  chance  of  being
    engaged", the judge found that the Dutch  national  had  satisfied  the
    requirements of Regulation 6(2)(b) of the Regulations over  the  course
    of the requisite five year  period.   On  this  basis  the  Appellant's
    appeal was allowed.

 5. Of significance in the appeal before me, paragraph 22 the judge states:

         "In  this  appeal  the  Appellant's  Sponsor  was  in  receipt   of
         jobseeker's allowance for three years and one month and the reality
         is that without  considerable  further  training  provided  by  the
         taxpayer the Appellant had little chance of being employed".

 6. Then at paragraph 26 the judge stated, "absent any relevant evidence at
    all as to Mr Ampopo's efforts to obtain employment it is  difficult  to
    determine whether or not during this period of three years he  had  had
    genuine chance of being engaged."




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The Respondent's grounds of appeal assert  that  there  is  a  material
    contradiction in the judge's findings  as  between  what  she  says  in
    paragraphs 22 and her ultimate conclusion that the Dutch  national  had
    been a qualified person throughout the period of unemployment.

 8. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison  on
    4 May 2017.




The hearing before me

 9. Ms Ahmad relied on the grounds of appeal and concentrated on  what  was
    said in paragraph 22 of  the  judge's  decision.   She  submitted  that
    before the advent of any training courses the Dutch national had had no
    real chance of being employed, and this is what in effect the judge has
    said in paragraph 22.  The genuine chance test involved both subjective
    and objective elements to it.

10. Mr Siaw asked me to consider the judge's decision as a whole.  She  had
    found the Dutch national to be a credible witness.  As a matter of fact
    he had been intent on finding employment throughout the relevant period
    and had in fact obtained a job in 2013.  This was  good  evidence  that
    his prospects of finding work prior to that had been genuine throughout
    the relevant period.




Decision on error of law

11. With some hesitation I find that the judge has materially erred in  law
    by failing to provide clear reasons, and in certain respects failing to
    make relevant findings, on material issues.

12. Notwithstanding the judge's  positive  view  of  the  Dutch  national's
    overall credibility, she  stated  in  paragraph  22  that  without  the
    further training courses undertaken, he  had  little  chance  of  being
    employed.  On the face of it that reads as though his chances of  being
    engaged prior to  undertaking  the  courses  were  less  than  genuine,
    applying both a subjective and objective test as stipulated by relevant
    case law from the Administrative Appeals Chamber.  I appreciate what is
    said in paragraphs 25 and 29 of her decision, and bear in mind that  of
    course the Dutch national ultimately  found  employment,  although  not
    until late 2013.

13. The uncertainty surrounding the judge's  view  of  the  genuine  chance
    issue is really only compounded by what she says in the second sentence
    of paragraph 26.  In my view there is either a failure to make a  clear
    finding on a relevant issue or a failure to provide adequate reasons.

14. I have concluded that the errors are material albeit, as  I  will  make
    clear below, my own conclusions when  remaking  the  decision  will  be
    favourable to the  Dutch  national,  and  of  course  in  turn  to  the
    Appellant herself.  The threshold of what is or is not  material  is  a
    somewhat grey area, but in my view the  face  of  the  decision  itself
    needs to be sufficiently clear to allow both parties to understand  why
    they have either won or lost.  It is not  the  case  with  the  judge's
    decision here.

15. I therefore set aside the judge's decision.

Remaking the decision

16. Both representatives were agreed that I could remake  the  decision  on
    the evidence before me, and this I now do.

17. Having looked at the evidence for myself, and there being no dispute as
    to the reliability of either documentary  evidence  or  that  from  the
    Appellant or Dutch national themselves, I find that the latter in  fact
    worked between 2009 and October 2010.   My  finding  on  the  end  date
    differs slightly from that of the judge because of  the  evidence  from
    HMRC at page 7 of the Appellant's bundle, in which it  states  the  end
    date of that employment to be 22 October 2010,  and  not  May  of  that
    year.

18. I  find  that  very  shortly  thereafter  the  Dutch  national  claimed
    jobseeker's allowance.  This  is  indicative  of  his  desire  to  find
    further work as soon  as  possible.   I  have  considered  the  various
    training certificates contained in the Appellant's bundle, beginning at
    page  19.   These  are  certificates  awarded  after   the   successful
    completion of various courses.  Certificates were awarded between  July
    and December 2011.  It follows, in my view, that the courses leading to
    the award of these certificates must have  begun  sometime  previously.
    Although I have not been provided with  specific  evidence  as  to  the
    particular duration of these courses, I draw the  reasonable  inference
    that they would have lasted for about six  months  at  least.   Working
    back from the award of most of the certificates  (that  being  November
    and December 2011), I find  that  the  Dutch  national  had  undertaken
    relevant training courses to assist his chances of employment in  early
    2011.  This was only a very short period after he was  made  unemployed
    from his previous work.

19. In turn, having regard to the relevant case law on the genuine  chances
    test I find that the combination of the Dutch national's own intentions
    and the objective enhancement of his employment  prospects  created  by
    the undertaking of the various courses, and the fact that he did obtain
    employment eventually, all go to  show  that  his  prospects  of  being
    engaged were indeed genuine throughout the relevant period.

20. It follows that he remained a  qualified  person  under  Regulation  6,
    having retained the worker status  that  he  previously  enjoyed.    In
    turn, he had acquired a permanent right  of  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  More importantly for the appeal before me, the Appellant,  as
    his family member, also acquired such a right.

21. The appeal succeeds on this basis.

22. Alternatively, if there had been a break in the qualification status of
    the Dutch national prior  to  him  undertaking  the  courses,  I  would
    nonetheless find that as at the end of 2011, once he had completed  all
    of the various courses  referred  to  in  the  Appellant's  bundle  his
    prospects of him being engaged were at the very latest, genuine by that
    stage.   He was a jobseeker thereafter and eventually became  a  worker
    upon finding employment in November 2013.  It follows from this that he
    has been a qualified person for a period in  excess  of  the  requisite
    five years in any event.

23. Therefore, on this alternative basis the Appellant herself has acquired
    a permanent right of residence.

24. The appeal is allowed on this alternative basis as well.




Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.



No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140.00. The Appellant has succeeded on the basis  upon  which  she
applied to the Respondent.
