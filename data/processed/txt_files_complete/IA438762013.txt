Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss Iqbal, Counsel, instructed by Fisher Meredith


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent, who I shall refer  to  as  the  appellant  as  she  was
    before the First-tier Tribunal, is a citizen of Zimbabwe and  her  date
    of birth is 18 November 1986.  She made  an  application  to  vary  her
    leave to remain in the UK on 5 September  2013  on  the  basis  of  her
    private life.  She came to the UK on 29 August 2004 as a student having
    been granted a student visa until 31  October  2006.  She  was  granted
    further leave until 9 September 2013.  The appellant was aged  17  when
    she first came to the UK.

2.   The Secretary of State refused the  application  under  the  Rules  and
    Article 8 of the 1950 Convention on Human Rights  on  7  October  2013.
    The appellant appealed against this decision and her appeal was allowed
    under Article 8 by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Meates  in  a
    decision 29 April 2014 that was promulgated on 1 May 2014  following  a
    hearing on 26 March 2014.  On 28 May 2014 the Secretary  of  State  was
    granted permission to appeal against the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Permission was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Ransley. Thus the matter came before me.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

3.   The First-tier Tribunal heard  evidence  from  the  appellant  and  her
    father, Mr J Matanga.  The appellant's evidence was that her  immediate
    family; namely her mother, father and brother, in the  UK.  Her  mother
    had come to the UK in 2004 having been granted a visa pursuant  to  the
    highly skilled migrant programme and the appellant's father  came  here
    as her dependant.  The appellant came to the UK as a student.  She  has
    finished her degree here and she has qualified as  a  pharmacist.   She
    works  as  a  locum  pharmacist  at  various  hospitals.    She   lives
    independently from her family with a cousin in London and  her  parents
    and her younger brother (who is presently studying A levels in the  UK)
    live in Northampton.  The appellant has returned  to  Zimbabwe  on  two
    occasions once in 2006 and once in  2011.  Her  maternal  and  paternal
    grandmothers live in Zimbabwe and she speaks to  them  sporadically  on
    the telephone.  The appellant and her family came to the UK as a result
    of the political climate in Zimbabwe at that time  and  her  father  is
    affiliated to Morgan Tsvangirai. The appellant's father's evidence  was
    that he was in the  process  of  starting  a  wholesale  pharmaceutical
    business selling products to Africa and that his daughter was the lynch
    pin to this business given her qualifications.

4.   The judge made findings at paragraphs 17 to 22 of the determination  as
    follows:

         "17.  In this appeal the burden of proof is on the appellant to the
             normal civil standard, namely on the balance  of  probability.
             It  is  accepted  that  the  appellant  does  not   meet   the
             requirements of the grant of leave under the Immigration Rules
             namely paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM.   In  line  with  the
             decision in MF [2012] UKUT 00393, approved in (Article 8 - New
             Rules) [2013] UKUT 0045 I go on to  consider  the  appellant's
             Article 8 claim by reference to the established case law.


         18.  In assessing the appellant's Article 8 claim I adopt the  five
             stage process set out in the case of R (Razgar)  -  v  -  SSHD
             [2004] UKHL 27.  In  considering the first stage of that  test
             I asked whether the removal of the appellant would  amount  to
             an interference with the exercise of her right or  respect  of
             private and family life. The appellant arrived in  the  United
             Kingdom on 29 August 2004  aged  17.  She  has  completed  the
             latter part of her education in the  United  Kingdom  and  has
             now engaged in her chosen profession,  clinical  pharmacy,  on
             the basis of educational qualifications obtained  in  the  UK.
             Thus I accept that private life has been  established  in  the
             UK. In addition, albeit  the appellant  is  an  adult,  it  is
             clear that there is a degree of  family  life  in  the  UK  as
             between her, her mother and father and her brother. Her sister
             lives in Canada.


         19.  Obviously should the appellant be removed from  the  UK  there
             would been an interference with that private and  family  life
             that she has established of such gravity to engage  Article  8
             of the ECHR. The  issue  therefore  is  whether  the  proposed
             interference  is  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  for   a
             legitimate public end. There has been no suggestion  that  the
             interference would be other than in accordance  with  the  law
             and I conclude that it would be for a  legitimate  public  end
             that is to maintain an effective immigration control.


         20.   The  crucial  issue  is  therefore   whether   the   proposed
             interference is proportionate  to  this  legitimate  end.   In
             considering the appellant's  relationship  with her  family  I
             conclude that they do not exceed the level for ties  envisaged
             in Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31 as it the case that  the
             relationship between the appellant  and  her  parents  can  be
             characterised as  a  relationship   exercising  no  more  than
             normal emotional ties. It is the appellant's case that she has
             established a business with her parents the intention of which
             is to export pharmaceutical products to Africa.  However  this
             is a business arrangement which does not take the relationship
             beyond the normal emotional  ties  as  outlined  in  Kugathas.
             Indeed the appellant's parents have  indicated  that  as  they
             would not  be  able  provide  for  her  financial  support  in
             Zimbabwe although this is at  odds  with  the  representations
             submitted on the appellant's by behalf under cover  to  letter
             of 5 September 2013 in which it is  stated  that  her  parents
             provide her with additional financial support in the amount of
             ï¿½500 per month. I find it unlikely that her parents would  not
             be able to make some  funds  available  to  provide  practical
             financial support to the appellant if she were to be  returned
             to Zimbabwe.


         21.  The appellant claims that she would  not  be  able  to  secure
             employment in Zimbabwe as a pharmacist.  She claims that there
             are no pharmacies in the area where either of her grandmothers
             live. This may well be the case.  However there is  no  reason
             whether or not the appellant cannot  establish  herself  in  a
             major  city  initially  with  the  financial  support  of  her
             parents. Whilst the appellant may experience some difficulties
             in practising as a  clinical  pharmacist  I  do  not  believe,
             without  time  and  a  degree  of  retraining  as  a  clinical
             practices, she would not be able to eventually practice in her
             chosen profession. Thus whilst the appellant  has  established
             private life in the United Kingdom there is nothing at all  in
             her circumstances, that would lead me to conclude that private
             life could  be re-established  to  some  degree  in  Zimbabwe.
             Having said that the real issue is proportionality.   The fact
             of the matter is that this appellant as remained in the United
             Kingdom lawfully for some nine and  a  half  years.   She  has
             obtained UK qualifications and I accept, to some  degree  that
             these  qualifications  will  not  be  easily   recognised   in
             Zimbabwe.  From these qualifications she has managed to secure
             employment within the  NHS  as  a  clinical  pharmacist.   She
             therefore continues to make a contribution to them in terms of
             the nature and fact of her employment.  Indeed her  employment
             is as a result of a lengthy, and it would  appear  successful,
             education within the UK education system.  Whilst  her  family
             life does not go beyond the normal emotional ties, the fact is
             that the majority of  the  appellant's  immediate  family  now
             reside  in the UK and the  ties  that  have  been  established
             would not  continue  in  the  same  form  were  the  appellant
             required to leave  the  UK.   It  is  beyond  doubt  that  the
             appellant would have a particular difficulty in  returning  to
             the UK even as a visitor.


         22.   This  is  a  case  in  which  the  proportionality   of   the
             respondent's decision is finely balanced. However  bearing  in
             mind the above, as well as the fact that  the  appellant  will
             shortly achieve 10 years' residence in the  UK,  a  period  at
             which the respondent herself recognisees that a grant of leave
             is appropriate, I conclude the decision of the  respondent  is
             not proportionate.  In my view it would not be reasonable  for
             the appellant to be required to relocate to Zimbabwe."

5.   The judge accepted that the appellant could not meet  the  requirements
    of the Rules and he went on to consider the appeal under Article  8  in
    accordance with Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27.   He  accepted  that  the
    appellant had a family and private life here and that there would be an
    interference with this and that the interference would be necessary. He
    went on to find  that  the  decision  would  not  be  proportionate  at
    paragraph 22.


The Grounds Seeking Leave to Appeal and Oral Submissions

6.     The grounds seeking leave to appeal argue  that  the  judge  did  not
    take into account relevant jurisprudence including MF (Nigeria)  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 1192, Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00060 (IAC) and  Nagre  [2013]  EWHC
    720 (Admin).  It is argued that the Immigration Rules  are  a  complete
    code and the First-tier Tribunal did  not  give  adequate  reasons  why
    there were compelling circumstances that would allow  the  Tribunal  to
    allow the appeal outside the Immigration  Rules.   It  is  argued  that
    there were no exceptional circumstances and there was no reason why the
    appellant could not continue private and family life in Zimbabwe.
7.   Mr  Melvin  made  oral  submissions  in  the  context  of  the  written
    submissions that he had submitted at the start of the  hearing  and  he
    expanded on the grounds seeking permission in  oral  submissions.  Miss
    Iqbal submitted that although there was no reference by  the  judge  to
    relevant case law, the judge completed  the  necessary  exercise  under
    Article 8 and she referred me specifically to paragraph 21 which in her
    view sets out why the judge found that there were arguably good grounds
    for granting leave outside the Rules.

Conclusions

8.   It is my view that the judge materially  erred  in  law.   He  did  not
    apply the guidance  in  Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
    approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC), R  (Nagre)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720
    (Admin) and this was  a  material  error  because  the  proportionality
    assessment carried out by the judge was  flawed.   He  did  not  attach
    weight to the fact  that  the  appellant  was  unable  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules (the relevant Rule in  this  case
    being that under paragraph 276ADE). The appellant  cannot  satisfy  the
    Rules because she has not been here for twenty years and  she  has  not
    established that she has no ties with Zimbabwe. The appellant  accepted
    that she did not meet the requirements of  the  Rules  at  the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal. The judge did not  identify  compelling
    circumstances  and  the  balancing  exercise  under   Article   8   was
    inadequate.

9.        I set aside the decision to  allow  the  appeal  under  Article  8
    pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement
    Act 2007 and I remake it pursuant to Section 12(2)(b)(ii).  No  further
    evidence has been submitted in accordance with the directions issued by
    the Upper Tribunal on 10 June 2014 and the  directions  made  it  clear
    that in the event that an error of law is found the decision  could  be
    remade at the hearing before me.

10.  Mr Melvin argued  that  I  should  remake  the  decision.   Miss  Iqbal
    requested that the matter be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a
    rehearing.  She indicated that there has been further  developments  in
    the appellant's father's business.  I went on to  remake  the  decision
    without a further hearing on the evidence that was  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, the appellant having been  given  ample  opportunity  to
    submit further evidence and has not done so.

11.   There  was  an  appellant's  bundle  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    comprising 107 pages and there is  no  challenge  to  the  evidence  as
    recorded by the judge in his determination.  There is no  challenge  to
    the primary findings of fact.  It is a fact that the appellant does not
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules and it  has  never  been
    argued  otherwise.    The  appellant  is  aged   27   and   she   lives
    independently from her parents.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that
    there was no family life in the Kugathas v  SSHD  [2003]  EWCA  Civ  31
    sense and there is no reason for me to go behind this finding.  However
    it is obvious that the appellant has a private life here and  that  she
    has a family life within the context of her private life.

12.  The appellant came here with her family when she was aged 17  in  order
    to study. The family came on  a  temporary  basis  only.  There  is  no
    persuasive evidence that the appellant or other family members would be
    at risk of persecution or serious harm should they return  to  Zimbabwe
    and it is a fact that there has  been  no  asylum  claim  made  by  the
    appellant or her parents. The appellant has returned to Zimbabwe on two
    occasions.  The appellant's father has a business  here  and  it  seems
    that it is intended that the appellant will  play  a  pivotal  role  in
    that.

13.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  it  was  unlikely   that   the
    appellant's parents could not  provide  her  with  support  should  she
    returned to Zimbabwe.  The judge found that there was no reason why the
    appellant could not establish herself in a city in Zimbabwe  where  she
    would eventually be able to practise as a pharmacist.   The judge found
    that she could establish private life in Zimbabwe.    I have taken into
    account that the appellant was a teenager when she came to the  UK  and
    the family's decision to come here should be viewed in the  context  of
    the political problems in Zimbabwe at the time.   She  and  her  family
    have been here for a significant period of time.  There is no reason to
    challenge the appellant's father's evidence that  he  has  as  business
    here and intends for his daughter to play a significant role  in  this.
    However, these factors in my  view  do  not  amount  to  arguably  good
    grounds for granting leave outside the Rules.

14.  There is no requirement for me to consider an assessment under  article
    8 in accordance with Razgar, R (on the application of)  v  SSHD  [2004]
    UKHL 27, but I will go on to do so. It is clear that  the  first  three
    questions should be answered in the affirmative.  Once  this  stage  is
    reached the burden of justification rests on the  Secretary  of  State.
    In my view the decision is necessary in pursuance of the legitimate aim
    (the economic wellbeing of  the  country  through  the  maintenance  of
    immigration control).  The appellant cannot meet  the  requirements  of
    the Rules and I attach  significant  weight  to  this.   There  are  no
    compelling or exceptional circumstances in this case.

15.  There are no compelling or exceptional circumstances and  the  decision
    is proportionate. The immigration Rules in this case interfere with the
    appellant's right to private life but this interference is justifiable,
    proportionate and lawful.  I remake  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and dismiss the appeal under Article 8 of the 1950  Convention
    on Human Rights.
