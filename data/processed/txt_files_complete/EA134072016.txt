Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Forrest, instructed by Sterling & Law Associates
LLP.
For the Respondent:    Mr Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Ukraine.  On 1 December 2009 she married
    a Polish national, Dariusz Reda.  On 21 September 2010 she entered  the
    United Kingdom as his EEA Family Member.  She was granted an EEA Family
    Permit valid until 20 May 2016.  It appears that the  marriage  was  in
    difficulties and the appellant  left  the  matrimonial  home  in  2014.
    Divorce proceedings were initiated on 9 February 2016 and  the  parties
    were divorced by decree of the Edinburgh  Sheriff  Court  on  21  March
    2016.

 2. On 16 May 2016 the appellant made an application for a residence  card.
    The form used was form EEA(PR).  In it, at page 15 of 85, the appellant
    has ticked the following statement:

         "I'm a non-EEA National and I am applying for a permanent residence
         card."

 3. At section 3 of the form, asked to indicate "the basis on which  you're
    applying  for  permanent  residence",  the  appellant  has  ticked  the
    following:

         "I've retained my right of residence after my EEA  national  family
         member died or left the UK, or their marriage or civil  partnership
         ended in divorce, annulment of dissolution, and I've lived  in  the
         UK for a continuous period of five years (including time spent as a
         family member)."

 4. In section 8 of the form "Retained Right of Residence",  the  appellant
    has entered the dates  to  which  we  have  already  referred,  and  at
    question 8.35, that at the date when the marriage ended,  Dariusz  Reda
    was a qualified person.  That meant that she had to give details of his
    activity whilst the marriage continued.  The details  in  question  are
    given as follows in sections 9.4 - 9.6.  In summary, his  activity  was
    that from November  2009  to  November  2013  he  was  "working";  from
    November 2013 to the present he was "self employed".  The names of  two
    employers, covering the period  November  2009  to  November  2013  are
    given.  So far as concerns self employment, the name and address of the
    business, and the type of business, are entered  as  "not  known".   At
    section 11, again, in the context of applying for a permanent residence
    card, the appellant sets out her relationship with her ex-husband.   In
    section 18,  again  in  the  context  of  qualifying  for  a  permanent
    residence card, the appellant has  indicated  which  documents  she  is
    enclosing with the forms.  At section 19, she has signed a  declaration
    beginning with the words:

         "I   hereby   apply   for   a   document    certifying    permanent
         residence/permanent residence   card".

 5. The application form was sent to the respondent under cover of a letter
    from D. Dhuheric & Solicitors of Edinburgh asserting that the appellant
    "has retained her right of residency in the UK and as such is  entitled
    to be granted permeant residency as a family member  who  has  retained
    the right of residence."

 6. There can,  we  think,  be  no  doubt  that  the  application  was  for
    documentation confirming a permanent right of residence.

 7. That application was refused on 2 November 2016.  The letter of refusal
    accepts the appellant's claim in relation to her marriage and  divorce;
    and accepts that the appellant's marriage subsisted for at least  three
    years, during one of which she  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom.  (In
    reality, there is no doubt that she has resided in the  United  Kingdom
    since 2010.)  The letter continues as follows:

         "You would also need to provide evidence that the EEA national  was
         a  qualified  person  and  that  you  were  therefore  residing  in
         accordance with the Regulations at the point of divorce.  In  order
         to do this you would need to provide evidence that the EEA national
         was exercising free movement rights when the decree was issued.

         You have not provided  any  evidence  that  your  EEA  sponsor  was
         exercising treaty rights at  the  time  your  decree  absolute  was
         issued.

         In order to meet the requirements of regulation 10(6) you also need
         to provide evidence that since the date of your  divorce  you  have
         been a worker, a self employed person or a self sufficient  person.
         As you have submitted evidence of your own employment in  the  form
         of wage slips and an employers letter since the date of divorce, it
         is accepted that you meet the requirements regulation 10.6.

         You have failed to provide evidence that you meet the  requirements
         of regulation 10 (5) and you have therefore not retained the  right
         of residence following divorce.

         As you have not provided evidence of  your  former  spouses  treaty
         rights up to the point of  your  divorce  you  cannot  satisfy  the
         requirement of regulation 15.1.f.

         Your application was also considered to see if  you  qualified  for
         permanent residence during the period of your marriage.   In  order
         to qualify you would need to demonstrate that your EEA sponsor  was
         exercising treaty rights  for  five  continuous  years  during  the
         period of your marriage.

         As evidence of your EEA sponsors treaty rights you  have  submitted
         p60's dated April 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.  These  documents  are
         sufficient to demonstrate that between April 2009  and  April  2013
         your EEA sponsor was employed.  However this only covers  a  period
         of 4 continuous years.

         It is noted that you have provide a PAYE coding notice addressed to
         your former spouse for the years April 2013-2014 and April  2014  -
         2015.  These documents by themselves are  not  sufficient  to  show
         that your EEA sponsor was employed during these years,  they  would
         need to be supported by either wage, slips, p60's or  an  employers
         letter.

         Therefore you have failed to demonstrate that  you  have  qualified
         for permanent residence during the period of your marriage and that
         you satisfy the requirements of regulation 15.1.f."

 8. The appellant appealed against the refusal.   The  grounds  of  appeal,
    settled by the same solicitors, are as follows:

         "The appellant applied  for  permanent  residency  as  someone  who
         retained the right of residency under regulation 10(5) of  the  EEA
         Regulations 2006.   The  evidence  provided  with  the  appellant's
         application was sufficient to  show  that  the  appellant's  former
         husband was exercising  the  treaty  rights  at  the  time  of  the
         divorce.  The respondent did not assess the evidence on the balance
         of probability."

 9. The appellant's appeal was heard by Judge  P.  A.  Grant-Hutchinson  in
    Glasgow on 5 February 2018.  The appellant  gave  oral  evidence.   The
    judge regarded her evidence as credible.  The decision  is  short  one.
    The reasons given are as follows:

         "9.  In coming to a decision I have to consider the  Home  Office's
             decision  to  refuse  the  Appellant's   Residence   Card   as
             confirmation of a right to reside with reference to Regulation
             10A of the EEA Regulations 2006.  The Regulation requires  the
             Appellant to provide  evidence  that  her  former  spouse  was
             exercising free movement rights in the United Kingdom and that
             her former spouse exercised Treaty rights continuously  for  5
             years up to  that  date.   The  burden  of  proof  is  on  the
             Appellant  and  the  standard  of  proof  is  the  balance  of
             probabilities.

         10.  The only documentary evidence that has been produced is  proof
             of an overpayment in the relevant years and a payment into the
             ex-spouse/sponsor's account.  The  Appellant  also  speaks  to
             having seen the  sponsor/ex-spouse  working  on  one  occasion
             during the relevant period.

         11.  The Appellant speaks to her relationship having broken down in
             2014.  It is often the case that when  a  relationship  breaks
             down individuals such as the Appellant experience considerable
             difficulties in proving  that  their  sponsor  was  exercising
             Treaty rights.  I  found  the  Appellant  to  be  an  entirely
             credible witness.   Nonetheless  the  Sponsor's  past  working
             history, the documents  lodged  and  her  oral  evidence  only
             create the mildest inference that the Sponsor  was  exercising
             his Treaty rights continuously for the relevant period.  I  am
             constrained to refuse the appeal under the said Regulations.

         12.  For the reasons above, I  accept  the  reasons  given  by  the
             Respondent in the refusal to issue a  Residence  Card  to  the
             Appellant.  The Appellant has not  discharged  the  burden  of
             proof and the reasons given by the Respondent do  justify  the
             refusal."

10. The appellant then applied to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to
    appeal.  The grounds of appeal  are  a  little  surprising.   After  an
    introductory paragraph they begin as follows:

         "2.  The ground of appeal is that the Judge materially erred in her
             interpretation of Article 12(2) of Directive 2004/38/EC of the
             European Parliament and of the Council  dated  29  April  2004
             ("the Citizens' Directive"), and the corresponding  Regulation
             10(5) of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
             2006 ("the 2006 Regulations").

         The legal issue in this appeal: a summary

         3.   The question of law to be determined by  FT  Tribunal  ("FTT")
             was as follows:

                  "In order to demonstrate a  retained  right  of  residence
                  under Regulation 10(5) of the  2006  Regulations,  must  a
                  third-country national demonstrate  that  his  former  EEA
                  national spouse was exercising his/her  Treaty  rights  in
                  the United Kingdom:

               a) at the date when divorce proceedings were initiated; or

               b) up until the date of decree absolute?"

         4.   The Appellant maintains her position as it was advanced before
             the FTT.  In summary, she submits that, correctly interpreted,
             Regulation 13(2) of the Citizens' Directive requires a  third-
             country national former spouse to demonstrate that his/her EEA
             national former spouse was exercising Treaty rights until  the
             date of the initiation of the divorce proceedings.

         5.    It  follows  that  the  Judge  materially  erred  in  law  in
             concluding that the Appellant  had  to  demonstrate  that  her
             former husband was a "qualified person" (within the meaning of
             the Regulation  10  of  the  EEA  2006  Regulations)  and  was
             exercising Treaty rights continuously for 5 years up  to  date
             of the decree absolute [�9]."

11. As can be seen, paragraph 9 of the judge's decision  does  not  mention
    any date in particular.  Further, the argument raised  in  the  grounds
    appears  not  to  have  been  advanced  previously.   The   appellant's
    "position as it was advanced for the FTT" is comprised  in  a  skeleton
    argument which makes no mention of any distinction between the date  of
    the initiation of the divorce and the date of the decree  absolute:  it
    refers only to "the date of the divorce".  There is no  trace  anywhere
    in the file, or in the judge's determination, of the question of law to
    be determined by the First-tier Tribunal, as set out in paragraph 3  of
    the grounds.  Permission was, however, granted by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Mailer.  He made no reference to the  discontinuity  between  the
    grounds and the previous proceedings.

12. In his submissions before us, Mr Forrest said that he  relied  only  on
    paragraph 13 of the grounds.  That paragraph is as follows:

         "13.  It  further  follows  that   the   Appellant   had   provided
             satisfactory evidence of  her  ex-husband's  exercise  of  his
             Treaty rights in the UK.  For the reasons set out above,  this
             appeal would have a real prospect of success.  It also  raises
             an  important  point  or  principle  regarding   the   correct
             interpretation of the previsions of Community law."

13. Mr Forest  also  told  us  that  he  did  not  reply  upon  any  ground
    complaining that the appellant should not have been refused recognition
    of a permanent right of residence.  He said he accepted that if she had
    asked for permanent residence it was rightly refused.

14. The point of law that is said to be so important in  the  determination
    of this appeal was settled so far as the United Kingdom is concerned by
    the judgment of Singh LJ in Baigazieva v SSHD  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1088.
    In his judgment Singh LJ explores and  confirms  a  position  statement
    which had been submitted by the Secretary of State by reference to NA v
    SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 995 and the decision of  the  CJEU  in  Singh  and
    Others v Ministry for Justice and Equality  (C-218/14)  in  particular.
    The statement forming the basis of  the  consent  order,  confirmed  by
    Singh LJ is as follows:

         "A third country national, in order to retain a right to reside  in
         the UK in reliance on Regulation 10(5), does not need to show  that
         their former EEA spouse exercised Treaty  rights  as  a  "qualified
         person" until the divorce itself.  Rather, it is sufficient to show
         that the former EEA spouse exercised treaty  rights  until  divorce
         proceedings were commenced."

15. This issue of law, however, makes  no  perceptible  difference  to  the
    present appeal.  The problem is not, and never was said to be, that the
    evidence of Mr Reda's activities was  different  on  the  date  of  the
    initiation and the date of the finalisation of  the  divorce  in  2016.
    The problem is that there was no sufficient evidence of his  activities
    after 2013.  So the position is that not only was the point  raised  by
    the grounds not in issue in the present appeal, nor was it  dealt  with
    by the judge; it could not have made any difference in any  event.   It
    is true that the letter of refusal specifically refers to the  date  of
    the  decree  absolute,  and  that  Judge  Grant-Hutchinson's   decision
    endorses the conclusion reached by the Secretary of State: but, in  the
    circumstances, it is very difficult indeed  to  see  why  Judge  Mailer
    granted permission to appeal.

16. Mr Forrest's submissions were directed to  showing  that  the  evidence
    adduced to the Secretary of  State  with  the  application,  and  again
    before the judge, was sufficient to establish that the appellant had  a
    right to continue to reside in the United Kingdom.   That  may  be  so,
    but, as Mr Govan pointed out, the application was for recognition of  a
    permanent right of residence; Mr Forrest had accepted that such a claim
    could  not  succeed;  and  the  appellant  had  not  made   any   other
    application, although she was at liberty to do so.

17. We agree.  Insofar as the judge may have  thought,  in  line  with  the
    letter of refusal, that the appropriate date was the date of the decree
    absolute rather than that of the initiation of the divorce,  she  erred
    in law.  If she did so,  her  error  is  immaterial,  because,  on  the
    evidence before her, her conclusion would  necessarily  have  been  the
    same even without the error.  It is now conceded that the Secretary  of
    State's decision refusing the appellant's application was  the  correct
    response to the application that was made.  We dismiss the  appellant's
    appeal to this Tribunal.
