For the Appellant:     Mr Okunowo a Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background


    1. The respondent  refused  the  appellant's  application  for  an  EEA
       Residence Card on 5 January 2015. His appeal was dismissed by First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Nightingale ("the Judge") following a hearing on
       17 September 2015.

The grant of permission


    2. Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer granted permission to appeal (11  April
       2016) stating that:


             "It is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal (FTT) applied  too
             high  a  threshold  when  determining  whether   or   not   the
             appellant's EEA wife was self-employed."

The Judge's determination

    3. The Judge noted the evidence within the determination that;


            "18. His wife was now working doing private  tuition  and  also
            managing artists and performing. She had been  doing  this  for
            about 6 months before she graduated as she had met some artists
            while she was on her course. She was self-employed.


            19.... She was an artist and she worked very hard...


            21. She was now self-employed  as  an  artist  and  gave  music
            lessons and she played. She had been doing this from after  her
            degree and she had no other job. I  asked  her  if  her  entire
            income for the last tax year amounted to a  profit  of  �1,092.
            She  said  yes,  that  was  right.  I  asked  how  she  managed
            financially on that amount and she said that  she  was  married
            and they were a  team.  The  appellant  supported  her  in  her
            passion and she was very lucky that he supports her."


    4. The Judge stated that;


            "33... I have very considerable doubts that the witness may, at
            the present time,  be  regarded  as  a  qualified  person.  She
            graduated in the summer of 2014  and,  it  is  said,  has  been
            operating as a self-employed person in the music industry since
            that time. There is very little before me with  regard  to  her
            economic endeavours save for accounts for the  year  ended  5th
            April 2015. In that time, her gross income was �2,858  and  her
            net profit only �1,092. Having graduated in the summer of 2014,
            this is a business which was set up and running for,  at  least
            eight months by April 2015. I cannot find earnings, after  tax,
            of �1,092 in an eight month period amounts to economic activity
            which is presently genuine and effective.   On  that  level  of
            income, I cannot regard her economic activity as anything other
            than marginal and ancillary. She freely admitted that  she  is,
            to  a  very  large  extent,  financially  dependent  upon   the
            appellant. On earnings which amounts to little more  than  �125
            per month,  she  would  not  be  meeting  the  minimum  earning
            threshold were she a worker.


            34. I have borne in mind  that  the  witness's  business  is  a
            relatively new endeavour and, indeed, fully accept that in  due
            course she may well become a qualified person as  her  business
            develops and her income  increases  so  as  to  make  her  work
            genuine and effective. However, at the present time  I  am  not
            satisfied on the balance  of  probabilities  that  she  may  be
            regarded as a qualified person ..."


Respondent's position

    5. Mr Walker relied on the Rule 24 notice (17 May  2016)  which  stated
       that the Judge was entitled to find  that  the  appellant's  spouses
       activities and earnings are marginal and ancillary.


Appellant's position


    6. Mr Okunowo submitted that  the  Judge  should  not  have  considered
       whether the work was effective or genuine. This was a new venture as
       permitted within regulation 4 [1][b] of  the  Immigration  (European
       Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the regulations").


Discussion

    7. The relevant parts of the regulations state

            "4.- "Worker", "self-employed person",...
            (1) In these Regulations-
            (a) "worker" means a worker within the meaning of Article 45 of
            the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;
            (b) "self-employed  person"  means  a  person  who  establishes
            himself in order to pursue activity as a  self-employed  person
            in accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty on the  Functioning
            of the European Union;

            6.- "Qualified person"
            (1) In these Regulations, "qualified person" means a person who
            is an EEA national and in the United Kingdom as-
            (a) a jobseeker;
            (b) a worker;..."


    8. I am not satisfied that Yusuf (EEA -  ceasing  to  be  a  jobseeker;
       effect) [2015] UKUT 00433 (IAC), AG and others (EEA  -  jobseeker  -
       self-sufficient person - proof) Germany [2007] UKAIT 00075,  and  RP
       (EEA Regs - worker - cessation) Italy [2006] UKAIT 00025 are of  any
       assistance as the appellant's spouse was not a jobseeker and had not
       ceased work.

    9. The Judge was plainly relying upon Begum (EEA worker  -  jobseeker)
       Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00275 (IAC) which states that a person who does
       not pursue effective and genuine activities, or  pursues  activities
       on such a small scale as to  be  regarded  as  purely  marginal  and
       ancillary or which have no economic value to an employer, is  not  a
       worker.  In this context, regard must be given to the nature of  the
       employment relationship and the rights  and  duties  of  the  person
       concerned to decide if work activities are effective and genuine.


   10. In my judgement this is not a relevant case to draw guidance from as
       the appellant's spouse was not claiming to be a worker (as in Begum)
       but to be self-employed. The tangential relevance of any work to  an
       employer is not the same as the impact a  self-employed  person  can
       have on the person to  whom  he  or  she  provides  services.  I  am
       satisfied the Judge has therefore materially  erred  in  applying  a
       threshold of economic value and marginality to an  employer/employee
       relationship when no such relationship existed. I therefore set  the
       decision aside.


   11. Both representatives agreed that, if I so found,  it  would  not  be
       appropriate to remit the matter or adjourn the hearing to a  further
       date as no further evidence was required.


Rehearing


   12. I am satisfied that on the facts as found the appellant's  wife  had
       established herself in order to pursue activity as  a  self-employed
       person. She had trained in a particular field,  set  up  a  business
       towards the end of that training, sought  out  clients,  and  earned
       money. It is not unusual that during the first few  months  of  such
       activity, profits will be low as work builds up.


   13. Accordingly, I allow the appeal.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

      I set aside the decision.

         I allow the appellant's substantive appeal.
