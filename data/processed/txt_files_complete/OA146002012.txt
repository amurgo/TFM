Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms. S Iqbal instructed by Chesham and Co
For the Respondent:    Mr. P. Deller Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

              DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. On 21 May 2013 we issued our ruling finding a material error of law in
      the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, setting aside  that  decision
      and giving directions for remaking that  decision.  A  copy  of  those
      directions is set out annex A.
   2. On 20 June 2013 Ms Iqbal supplied us with a skeleton argument  and  on
      26 June 2013 an opinion from Syed Ahmad, an advocate  of  the  Supreme
      Court of India. These materials suggested that  the  marriage  between
      the parties celebrated in  the Mumbai mosque at  on 6 April 2012 was a
      valid marriage by two different routes:-


                 i) Route One was that the registration of the  marriage  by
                    the Marriage Officer Karnataka   on  15  September  2012
                    under  the  s.  15  Special  Marriage  Act  1954   (SMA)
                    validated the religious marriage as of the date  of  its
                    celebration.


                ii) Route Two was the proposition that Indian law recognised
                    a marriage between two muslims celebrated in a mosque as
                    a valid marriage in the absence of registration if  they
                    had the capacity to marry.


   3. The Entry Clearance Officer  has  not  adduced  any  new  evidence  or
      submitted any reasons why the facts as we understood them to be at the
      time we issued the directions should not be applied in the remaking of
      this decision. Accordingly, the only issue of fact is whether  at  the
      time of the ECO's decision on 12 July 2012 the  parties  were  validly
      married.


   4. Mr Deller helpfully indicated that in the light of the evidence as  it
      stood before us, he did not dispute that they were married and in  the
      circumstances there was  no  reason  why  the  appeal  should  not  be
      allowed.

   5. We accordingly indicated that the appeal would be  allowed  and  brief
      reasons would follow.

   6. On our primary findings the sponsor's previous relationship in the  UK
      was not a in law a marriage and did not require any formal dissolution
      to give the sponsor capacity to marry according  to  the  law  of  his
      domicile: English law.

   7. The requirements of a valid marriage celebrated in India are those set
      out  in  the  procedural  requirements  of   local   law   (lex   loci
      celebrationis).  We are persuaded by the opinion of Mr Ahmad that  the
      civil law in India defers to the  personal  law  of  the  parties  and
      recognises a bare nikah as a valid marriage if  both  parties  to  the
      marriage were muslim by professed faith and had the capacity to  enter
      the marriage  under  their  personal  law  (see  Muslim  Personal  Law
      (Shariat) Act 1937). There is apparently no  Muslim  Marriage  Act  as
      such.   Although there was a local law requiring registration of  such
      marriages, Bombay Registration of Marriages Act 1953, s.7 of that Act,
      quoted in the opinion, makes plan that failure to  register  will  not
      invalidate the marriage. There  is  nothing  in  the  opinion  or  the
      materials annexed to it to indicate that these principles  only  apply
      to muslims who are domiciled in and /or nationals of India.

   8. There is,  therefore,  some  evidence  before  us  that  the  couple's
      marriage in April 2012 was a valid one and none to suggest that it was
      not. Proof of foreign law is a matter of fact and accordingly  we  are
      satisfied on balance of probabilities that the marriage was valid, and
      in the circumstances, every relevant requirement  of  the  Immigration
      Rules has been met.

   9. We do not need to consider Ms Iqbal's route 1 that may have  contained
      a number of problems about receipt of  post-decision  evidence  and  a
      possible  conflict  between  the  declaration  on  the  face  of   the
      certificate and the terms of s.18 of the SMA.

  10. We add that it may be prudent for a UK domiciled sponsor  who  marries
      by religious ceremony in India to apply to register the marriage under
      s.15 SMA as it resolves possible  doubts  that  might  exist  in  such
      cases. It would appear from a Government of India Press  release  that
      on  12  April  2012  the  cabinet  approved  a  Bill  for   compulsory
      registration of all marriages.

  11. We further add, that had it been necessary to do  so,  we  might  well
      have concluded that the interference with enjoyment of  family  caused
      by the refusal of entry clearance in this decision, was not  justified
      in the particular circumstances of this case.  Before she applied  for
      entry clearance the appellant through the sponsor asked the  perfectly
      sensible question of the ECO whether registration was needed, to which
      no sensible response was given. To rely on the absence of registration
      as a sufficient basis to refuse the application when  nothing  in  the
      application form, or the response to the  question  suggested  it  was
      needed would be so unfair as to be unjustifiable. The ECO has  already
      received a very substantial fee for processing  this  application;  it
      would be disproportionate to insist in a fresh application  and  fresh
      fee to permit the couple to live together in the United Kingdom.

  12.  However, on the evidence before us and in the light  of  Mr  Deller's
      express acceptance of it, we allow this appeal because  the  appellant
      met the relevant requirement of the  immigration  rules  to  join  the
      sponsor.

  13. We express the hope that entry clearance can now be  granted  speedily
      on receipt of this determination. We give liberty to apply within  six
      weeks of  the  date  of  this  decision  for  the  appellant  to  seek
      directions in the event that entry clearance has not been  granted  by
      then.




     The Hon Mr Justice Blake

     Chamber President

     5 July 2013






Appendix A:  Ruling and Directions  21 May 2013


   1.   The appellant is a citizen of India born in 1976.  She  appeals  the
      decision of Judge Morris sitting in the First-tier Tribunal  dated  22
      March 2013.  In that decision she  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal
      against a refusal of entry clearance to join the sponsor in the United
      Kingdom as his wife. The  sponsor  is  Mr  Master  who  is  a  British
      citizen.


   2.     The basic narrative of events is as follows:-

        i. Mr Master had a previous partner in the United Kingdom Ms H.
       ii. Mr Master and Ms. H are both muslims by religion and  celebrated
           their union in a nikah ceremony in their home.
      iii. Such a ceremony may have made them man and wife for the purposes
           of Islamic law but did not do  so  for  the  purposes  of  their
           respective civil status in the law of the United Kingdom.
       iv. The couple were in a personal relationship as man and wife  from
           around 1997 to 2005.  Two children were born to their union  now
           aged 13 and 11.
        v. The couple lived for a time 28 Forburg Road London N 16.
       vi. The couple state they ceased living together as man and wife  in
           about 2005.
      vii. It seems that Ms H married someone from India in  that  year  by
           Islamic ceremony who was admitted to the United Kingdom  as  her
           spouse but the marriage subsequently broke down.
     viii. In 2011 Mr Master wanted a new  partner  and  asked  family  and
           friends in India to assist him to find one for him.
       ix. The appellant was identified.  She lived in Bangalore.
        x. In January 2012 the sponsor travelled to Bangalore  and met  the
           appellant; they decided to marry. The sponsor returned to  India
           in February and again in April 2012.
       xi. They went through  an  Islamic  marriage  in  the  Khatib-E-Imam
           Mosque  Mumbai on 6 April 2012.
      xii. The following day the entry clearance application was made.
     xiii. This was refused on 12 July 2012.

   3. There is an unusual feature in this case that caused  both  the  Entry
      Clearance officer and the judge concern. Mr. Master and Ms H continued
      to share a house after their separation. In January 2012, the house at
      Forburg Road was sold for �725,000. Mr Master bought another house  at
      Rush Green Romford for �222,000. This was registered in the sole  name
      of Ms H. A balance of �199,000 was paid into his account  at  Barclays
      in February 2012.  In 16  January  2012  his  conveyancing  solicitors
      stated that an unspecified sum was being retained by them for  him  to
      purchase a new home in the future.


   4. In the meantime he moved to Romford  with  Ms.  H  and  on  his  entry
      clearance application he proposed to live there with his wife  in  the
      short term in the event that entry clearance was granted.   The  house
      had four bedrooms, a living room and  dining  room  and  there  was  a
      report from  an  Environmental  Health  Consultant  stating  that  the
      accommodation was adequate in size for the two households:  Mr  Master
      and the appellant, and Ms H and her two children.


   5. The Entry Clearance Officer  Mumbai refused the application because:-

        i. He was not satisfied that  Mr  Master  was  free  to  marry  the
           appellant because of his previous relationship with Ms. H.
       ii. He was not satisfied that the marriage ceremony in India  was  a
           valid marriage because it  had  not  been  registered  with  the
           competent authority in the state marriage register.
      iii. He was not satisfied that the couple intended to  live  together
           as man and wife having regard to the  short  duration  of  their
           relationship and the sponsor's ties to Ms H.
       iv. He was not satisfied that the offer  of  free  accommodation  in
           Romford to the couple by Ms H was durable and stable.

   6. When the case came before the Judge, the appellant  had  provided  two
      bundles of material. In the first bundle there was a statement from Ms
      H expressing her willingness for the sponsor and his new wife to  live
      rent free in her home in Romford  until  they  established  themselves
      elsewhere. She pointed out that the sponsor had provided her with  the
      house in the first place and was actively involved in  the  upbringing
      of their children.


   7. There  was  evidence  of  the  sponsor's  self-employment  with  gross
      earnings of �18,012 and his tax  liabilities  were  up  to  date.  His
      Barclaycard account stood at �103,000 as of 24  February  2012;  there
      was �6,627 in his account at Lloyds Bank at the same date.

   8. There was extensive evidence of his visits to India  in  February  and
      April 2012, the wedding invitation and travel to Mumbai  and  a  hotel
      accommodation following the wedding. There was a supplementary  bundle
      that included post decision evidence  including  evidence  of  further
      visits to India by the sponsor in May, June and August  2012,  medical
      evidence as to the pregnancy  of  the  appellant  and  the  subsequent
      registration of the marriage with the civil authorities  in  September
      2012.

   9. The sponsor and Ms H both gave evidence.  They  explained  that  their
      previous relationship was terminated by a talaq in January  2005,  but
      they continued to live in the same house albeit in separate  bedrooms.
      They both explained that the sponsor plays a role  with  the  children
      driving one child to motor sports and  martial  acts  activities,  the
      latter required a  45  minutes  car  journey  from  Romford  to  Stoke
      Newington N 16. Ms H confirmed she was still happy to accommodate  the
      sponsor and his wife, who was now seven months pregnant and  would  be
      happy to do when the baby arrived.

  10.  In the course of submissions Ms. Shafiq who appeared below and before
      us submitted some internet material to  the  effect  that  an  Islamic
      marriage was valid in India and there was no requirement  for  such  a
      marriage to be registered with the  civil  authorities.   One  of  the
      information sheets referred to the Special Marriage Act of India 1954.
       Ms Shafiq also referred to the fact that on 5 March 2012 the  sponsor
      has emailed the visa inquiries section of the High Commission  stating
      that he was about to have a religious marriage ceremony and  inquiring
      whether the certificate of the religious ceremony was  sufficient  for
      entry clearance purposes and if not could the marriage  be  registered
      in the British Embassy. There is a reply in the bundle from  the  High
      Commission dated 12 March to the  effect  that  each  application  was
      dealt with on its merits and that it was left to the discretion of the
      entry clearance officer to be satisfied to issue a  visa  and  it  was
      open to the parties to submit what  documents  they  considered  would
      satisfy the ECO.

  11. The judge reached the conclusion at paragraphs 14 and 15 she  was  not
      satisfied that the appellant's alleged marriage  to  the  sponsor  was
      subsisting and the parties intended to live together as man and  wife.
      She acknowledged that it was arguable that the Indian marriage did not
      need to be registered in India.  She gave in effect seven reasons  for
      this conclusion:

        i. No evidence had been adduced to support the testimony  that  the
           sponsor and Ms were no longer in a relationship.  They continued
           to cohabit.
       ii. The witness to the talaq divorce between in January 2005 was not
           present at the hearing.
      iii. There was no evidence to show how Ms H and the sponsor had first
           married at the onset of their relationship.
       iv. Ms H produced evidence of her marriage to Mr H in December  2005
           but this had not been produced to the ECO and  was  not  in  the
           appeal bundle but only handed up at the hearing, and she was not
           willing to attach weight to it.
        v. The reasons why  the  sponsor  and  Ms  H  shared  a  roof  were
           conflicting. They both said it  was  because  of  the  continued
           connection with the children but the sponsor also added  he  was
           waiting to buy another house when the price was right.
       vi. The judge did not think that the fact that the sponsor drove the
           child to martial arts was a good enough reason for him to remain
           in contact with Mr. H. She did not  seem  to  think  that  a  45
           minute drive for a 14 years old was a long distance to travel or
           one that could not be undertaken by public transport.
      vii. The judge was not willing to place any weight on other offers of
           accommodation for the sponsor.

  12. The judge went on to make adverse  findings  as  the  evidence  as  to
      maintenance and accommodation and discounted the evidence  of  nuptial
      visits to India in the light of her  doubts  as  to  the  relationship
      between the sponsor and Ms H.


   Error of Law


  13.  We are  satisfied  that  the  determination  of  the  judge  involved
      significant errors of law material to her findings.  We  announced  at
      the conclusion of the hearing that we would set aside her decision and
      remake it for ourselves. We now give our reasons for doing so.


  14.  The founding error, common to both  the  ECO  and  the  judge  was  a
      misunderstanding as to the legal status of the relationship between Ms
      H and the sponsor.  There was never a suggestion that either  of  them
      had entered into a marriage valid in the law  of  England  and  Wales.
      Both remained free to marry another person whatever the state of their
      personal connections with each other.

  15.  Whilst it was understandable that practising Muslims would undergo  a
      religious ceremony in the  United  Kingdom,  there  was  no  point  in
      proving such a ceremony on appeal as it had no relevance to the  issue
      of capacity to marry as it was clearly no legal  impediment  to  doing
      so. The record demonstrates that Ms Sharif was alert  to  this  during
      the hearing but the judge appears not to have listened or understood.

  16. An immigration appeal is  not  a  confessional  life  history  of  the
      parties or their witnesses, but an informed and economical hearing  of
      material relevant to the issues.  The judge's reasons at paragraph  11
      (iv)   above is symptomatic of her  error of approach.  The  sponsor's
      previous partner supported her witness statement that her relationship
      as spouse with the sponsor had terminated in January 2005. She pointed
      out that she had married someone else in December 2005  who  had  been
      admitted to the UK  for  this  reason  and  she  produced  a  marriage
      certificate.  It was helpful of her to do so; but she was not on trial
      or making an application for entry clearance with a burden of proof to
      discharge. No reasonable judge properly directing herself  could  have
      drawn  an  adverse  conclusion  from  the  late  production  of   such
      supporting information.


  17. We have carefully examined  each of the reasons of the judge that   we
      have summarised above and conclude that each was materially flawed and
      combined together none of them remotely founds  a  rational  basis  to
      reject the oral and documentary evidence before the judge.

  18. In particular we note as to i) cohabitation means living  together  as
      man and wife and not living together under the same roof and the judge
      mis-states the  common  evidence  that  the  parties  were  living  in
      separate bedrooms under one roof;  ii) the  evidence  of  the  Islamic
      ceremony that founded the relationship between Ms H and the talaq that
      ended was  irrelevant  to  the  capacity  to  marry;  iii)  there  was
      additional evidence independent of the parties indicative of the  fact
      the sponsor and Ms H were no  longer  in  a  matrimonial  relationship
      including her 2005 marriage and successful  sponsorship  of  a  person
      from abroad, the sale of  the3  house  and  the  registration  of  the
      Romford property in Mr H's sole name  and  indeed  the  fact  that  Mr
      Master had wanted to marry someone else; iv)  there  was  no  conflict
      between the reasons given by the  witnesses  as  to  why  the  sponsor
      continued to live under the same roof as Ms H,  the fact that  he  was
      waiting to buy a new home was a second but not a  conflicting  reason;
      v) the judge's doubts as to whether a  14 year could  be  expected  to
      travel by public transport from Romford to  Stoke  Newington  suggests
      that  she  does  not  understand  the   geography  of  London,  public
      transport, or child care.


  19.  We would accept that the post-decision evidence  of  alternatives  to
      accommodation to with the sponsor was irrelevant  to  the  appeal  and
      could be discounted, but this  was  not  a  reason  to  doubt  Ms  H's
      evidence that she was willing to let the father of  her  children  who
      had provided her with a house in her own name live rent free with  his
      wife until he established himself.   We  accept  the  arrangement  was
      unusual and may not have appealed to  many  former  couples,  but  the
      sponsor was frank and honest  about  this  from  the  start,  and  the
      arrangements were not so unusual as to be incapable of belief. In  the
      real  world  of  terminating  relationships  with  extravagant  London
      property prices and the practical need for  former  couples  to  share
      child care, the arrangements are  far  from  being  either  unique  or
      unreasonable.

  20. Taking the clear and consistent evidence between Ms H and the  sponsor
      as whole we can simply find no sensible reason for  rejecting  it  and
      certainly none that has been identified by the  judge.   In  fact  the
      judge has never stated that she rejects Ms H's evidence in  terms.  We
      are not surprised. We note that Ms  H  works  as  a  police  community
      support officer and there is nothing  known  to  her  discredit.  Some
      relevant or cogent reason for rejecting her evidence would  be  needed
      before it could be discounted.  The supposed absence of  corroboration
      does not amount to such a reason. If her evidence is  accepted  as  we
      conclude it should have been  in  these  circumstances,  the  concerns
      about  the  appellant's  relationship  with  the   sponsor   and   the
      availability of adequate accommodation fall away.

  21. The ECO took no issue  on  maintenance  apart  from  the  question  of
      accommodation. Neither should the judge.  The  sponsor  obviously  had
      enough funds to support himself and his wife, from his gross  earnings
      and extensive capital assets.

 Remaking

  22.  We have no doubt that all of the judge's findings should be set aside
      and the decision remade.


  23.  Strangely the one issue with which the judge took  no  issue  is  the
      most difficult  for  the  sponsor.   This  is  whether  the  religious
      marriage in Mumbai is a lawful one for immigration purposes.  We  have
      seen no evidence that it is.  We handed to the parties a copy  of  the
      Special Marriage Act 1954 (SMA) downloaded from the  internet  at  the
      date of hearing. If the text of the Act is accurate as of the date  of
      the marriage, it would appear that the religious marriage did not meet
      the requirements for validity under this Act.  There  is  no  evidence
      that:  a notice of  intended  marriage  was  served  on  the  Marriage
      Officer as required  by  s.5,;  the  marriage  was  published  in  the
      Marriage Book as required  b  s.6;  a  declaration  was  made  in  the
      presence of the Marriage Officer as required  by  s.11;  or  that  the
      marriage was solemnized and registered as required by ss. 12  and  13.
      Section 15 enables but does not require marriages celebrated in  other
      forms to be registered under the SMA. This was not done at the time of
      the decision but has been performed subsequently in September.

  24. There would be little reason to now doubt that the parties are married
      but that is not the issue on an entry clearance appeal where the focus
      is the evidence of events at the time of the decision.


  25. If the appellant is to succeed under this appeal  she  would  need  to
      establish by cogent  and  reliable  evidence  that  a  nikah  ceremony
      celebrated in a mosque in Mumbai between a British  citizen  domiciled
      in the UK and a woman resident in Bangalore was a valid marriage.   We
      would be surprised if this turned out to  be  the  case,  but  we  are
      willing to adjourn the case until 2nd July 2013  for this matter to be
      fully explored with evidence.  We do so because  the  ECO  appears  to
      have been open to the proposition in the response  to  the  email  and
      because the issue is of some general importance.

  26.  We will remake the decision on  the  same  primary  evidence  as  was
      before the ECO and the judge.  For reasons we have  already  explained
      in the error of law decision, we see no reason to conclude other  than
      that the sponsor was free to marry the appellant,  the  appellant  and
      the sponsor intend to live together in a married relationship that  is
      still subsisting, the couple have  suitable  accommodation  when  they
      first live together in the United Kingdom, and the sponsor is able  to
      support his family without recourse to public funds.  Absent some  new
      evidence emerging to throw doubt upon this data, these are not matters
      that need to be re-argued on the next occasion.

  27. We agree with Mr Deller that the  argument  made  in  the  grounds  of
      appeal that the ECO should have considered the appellant as a  fianc�e
      is without substance. No application was made in such category and  it
      would have been necessary to have indicated that a UK  marriage  would
      take place shortly after arrival and there was no such evidence.

  28. We accept that Article 8 is an issue for examination  on  the  factual
      predicate of 23  above.  Although  the  appellant  would  normally  be
      expected to meet the rules a s a spouse, she could readily  have  done
      so if the response to the pre-application inquiry had explained that a
      civil registration of the marriage was required.

  29.  If the ECO was prepared to waive the requirement  of  a  valid  civil
      marriage if the relationship was otherwise genuine, then  there  is  a
      compelling case for admission under Article 8 if the facts turn out to
      be as we have  indicated.  If  the  ECO  was  well  aware  that  civil
      registration  was  required  then  the  answer  given  was   seriously
      misleading. Where an applicant pays something in the order of �800 for
      an entry clearance application to be  processed,  they  are  at  least
      entitled to an accurate answer to a reasonable question.

Directions:

  30.  The same panel will remake this case on 2 July 2013.   The  appellant
      must supply any  further  evidence  on  the  validity  of  the  Indian
      marriage by 18 June 2013 together with  a  skeleton  argument  on  the
      marriage and Article 8 issue. This material should be  served  on  the
      Tribunal marked for the attention of the president and  on  Mr  Deller
      personally who has indicated will retain conduct of  this  appeal  for
      the respondent.


  31.  The respondent should file a written response to  this  material  and
      these directions by 25 June 2013. This  should  indicate  whether  any
      cross-examination of the appellant's witnesses is sought.

  32. We anticipate that in the absence of oral hearing  1  hour  should  be
      sufficient to determine this appeal
