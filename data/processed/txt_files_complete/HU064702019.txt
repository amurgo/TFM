For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Judge Sarwar  sitting  in  Manchester  who  dismissed  his  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse his application for
    indefinite leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  with  reference  to
    paragraph 322(5) and deception.

 2. The facts of this application are set out at [9] - [14]  and  [20]-[29]
    in the First-tier Judge's decision, the core facts being at [24]:

         "24. However checks with HMRC confirmed that in the Appellant's tax
             return  for  the  year  2010/2011  he  declared   were   [sic]
             �15,071.00 profit from self-employment  and  �0  PAYE  income.
             However, this was amended on  the  22  September  2016,  after
             applying  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain.   The  Appellant
             increased his profit from self-employment  to  �50,556.00  and
             declared �2,893.00 PAYE income."

Balajigari and fairness

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge was referred to the decision of the Court
    of Appeal  in  Balajigari  v  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2019] EWCA Civ 673 which gives the  following  guidance  to
    Tribunals in the judgment of Lord Justice  Underhill,  with  whom  Lord
    Justices Hickinbottom and Singh agreed:

         "92. The principal substantive consequence of our finding that  the
             refusal of T1GM ILR on paragraph 322 grounds will  (typically)
             engage article 8 is that in any legal challenge  the  Tribunal
             will be obliged to reach its own  conclusion  on  whether  the
             interference  is   justified,   rather   than   conducting   a
             rationality review: as to this, see para. 104  below.   In  an
             earnings discrepancy case that  means,  principally,  that  it
             will have to decide for itself whether the discrepancy was the
             result of dishonest conduct by the applicant in the  supplying
             of figures to either HMRC or the Home Office.  If it  was,  in
             the generality of cases such a finding will be sufficient, for
             the purposes of the final  Razgar  question,  to  justify  the
             applicant being refused leave to remain  and  in  consequence,
             which  is  the  relevant  interference,  becoming  liable   to
             removal.  The situation  is  analogous  to  that  in  Ahsan  v
             Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
             2009, where the claimants' article 8 rights were  in  practice
             dependent on whether they had cheated  in  their  TOEIC  tests
             (see paras. 76 and 88 of the judgment  of  Underhill  LJ)  and
             this Court held that they were entitled to have that  question
             determined by the Tribunal as a matter of fact.  There may  be
             exceptional cases in which it can be argued that removal would
             be disproportionate despite the applicant's  past  dishonesty,
             and that issue too would in principle have to be judged by the
             Tribunal for itself, while giving due weight to  Secretary  of
             State's assessment of  the  public  interest.   But  paragraph
             322(5) itself likewise allows  for  the  possibility  of  such
             exceptional cases (see para. 39 above), and there need  be  no
             difference in  the  nature  of  the  exercise  whether  it  is
             expressed as the exercise of a public law discretion or  as  a
             proportionality assessment under article 8. ...

         105. The Tribunal, as well as the Secretary of State, of course has
             an obligation to act  with  procedural  fairness.   Where  the
             Secretary of State has alleged dishonesty, that will  normally
             require the Tribunal - whether the FTT on an appeal, or the UT
             on a claim for judicial review  -  to  give  the  claimant  an
             opportunity to adduce evidence in rebuttal;  and,  given  that
             credibility will be in issue, that will  normally  include  an
             opportunity to give oral evidence himself  or  herself  and/or
             call relevant witnesses (e.g. their accountant) to  give  oral
             evidence."

 4. Subsequent to the  Balajigari  decision,  but  after  the  hearing  and
    determination  of  this  case,  in  Abbasi  (rule  43;   para   322(5):
    accountants' evidence) [2020] UKUT 27 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal  in  its
    headnote, gave the following guidance:-

         "3.  In a case involving a decision under paragraph 322(5)  of  the
             immigration  rules,  where  an  individual  relies   upon   an
             accountant's letter  admitting  fault  in  the  submission  of
             incorrect tax returns to Her Majesty's  Revenue  and  Customs,
             the First-tier or Upper Tribunal  is  unlikely  to  place  any
             material weight on that letter  if  the  accountant  does  not
             attend the  hearing  to  give  evidence,  by  reference  to  a
             Statement of Truth, that explains in detail the  circumstances
             in which the error came to be made; the basis  and  nature  of
             any compensation; and whether the firm's insurers  and/or  any
             relevant  regulatory  body  have  been  informed.    This   is
             particularly so where the letter  is  clearly  perfunctory  in
             nature."

Grounds of appeal

 5. The appellant challenges the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    four ways, none of which is material, for the reasons I now set out.

 6. Ground 1.         The appellant asserts that the First-tier Judge erred
    in setting out the burden of proof in these cases because  at  [5],  no
    doubt in standard text which this judge uses in all  cases,  he  stated
    that the burden of proof was upon the appellant  and  the  standard  of
    proof was the balance  of  probabilities.   That  is  a  correct  self-
    direction as to the generic burden of proof in an immigration appeal.

 7. However, at [47]-[48], the Judge set out the correct  burden  of  proof
    which is a shifting burden with the  Secretary  of  State  required  to
    establish a basis  for  a  conclusion  of  dishonesty  from  which  the
    Tribunal  is  entitled  to  draw  an  inference  where   no   plausible
    explanation is given, with the  appellant  then  required  to  show  an
    innocent  explanation  to  displace  the  prima  facie   inference   of
    dishonesty.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge reminded himself of the applicable  civil
    standard of proof, balance of probabilities, which applies to assessing
    whether an appellant has been dishonest in relation to his tax  affairs
    with the consequence that he is denied settlement in the UK.  That is a
    correct statement of the standard and burden of proof and in  the  rest
    of the decision and in particular at [64] it is clear that that is  the
    standard and burden of proof which this judge applied.  Ground 1 is not
    made out.

 9. Ground 2.         The  appellant  disputes  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    finding of fact that he had advanced no explanation for  the  error  in
    his tax returns.  The appellant's oral  evidence  was  that  he  relied
    entirely on his accountants and did not check his tax  returns,  simply
    signing  them  as  drafted.   He  is  the  taxpayer   and   the   legal
    responsibility for accounting correctly to HMRC for his  income  is  on
    him.  It is not an irrelevant fact that HMRC did  impose  penalties  on
    the appellant for non-disclosure, rather than just accepting the unpaid
    tax and interest.

10. The appellant relies on a letter from his accountants which appears  at
    page 23 of his bundle, but which provides no explanation at all save to
    acknowledge the error.  That letter falls  within  the  description  in
    Abbasi of a letter  which  is  'clearly  perfunctory  in  nature'.   In
    particular, there is no evidence that having made  such  a  significant
    error in a client's accounts, the  accountants  took  any  professional
    steps.  They do not appear to have informed either  their  professional
    body or their insurers that they had  made  such  a  serious  error  in
    dealing with this appellant's tax affairs.

11. At [55] the judge says that he attached 'due weight' to the  letter  at
    page 23 'but no explanation is offered as to how the error came about':
     he observed at [56] that the appellant  had  not  formally  complained
    about the accountant's conduct and there had been no  repercussions  on
    the individual accountant.   In  his  oral  evidence,  both  in  cross-
    examination and re-examination, the  appellant  confirmed  that  to  be
    correct.  The criticism in the grounds of appeal of 'due weight' as  an
    inadequate description  of  the  weight  attached  is  unsound:  it  is
    difficult to see how the Judge could attach any  weight  at  all  to  a
    letter in such perfunctory terms and I am satisfied that the Judge  did
    not err in his appreciation of the weight to be accorded to it.

12. The First-tier Tribunal Judge was unarguably entitled  to  characterise
    the appellant's explanation of  the  error  as  'no  explanation':  the
    appellant's response and the accountant's letter were no explanation at
    all.  The contention in the grounds of appeal to the contrary does  not
    provide a proper basis for interfering with the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    finding of fact applying the standard at paragraph 90 of R (Iran) & Ors
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982

13. Ground 3. The appellant contended that it was not open to the judge  to
    have regard to whether there were any individual repercussions  on  the
    individual accountant.  But that forms part  of  the  overall  evidence
    before and  indeed  the  oral  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  and  is
    unarguable.  Mr Dingley for the appellant did not  seek  to  go  beyond
    what was stated in the grounds of appeal.

14. Ground 4.     This ground  relates  to  the  proper  interpretation  of
    Balajigari.  The appellant relies on the Secretary of  State's  failure
    to serve a 'minded to refuse' notice, Balajigari having not been  heard
    and decided in the Court of Appeal when the refusal letter was written.



15. The appellant submits that it is Robinson obvious that the Secretary of
    State ought to have done so but I confess that pre-Balajigari it  would
    not have been Robinson obvious and indeed that given that the appellant
    has had  the  opportunity  to  bring  his  evidence  and  provide  such
    explanation as he would have relied upon,  had  a  'minded  to  refuse'
    notice been issued, and the inadequacy  of  that  evidence,  I  am  not
    satisfied that any error (if, which I do not accept, there was such  an
    error) is material, on the factual matrix of the present appeal.

16. The grounds of appeal disclose no material error of either fact or  law
    in the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  which  is  upheld.   This
    appeal is dismissed.

Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.
