                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr O Yekini, Solicitor, Supreme Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss A Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting
Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing the appeal of the appellants  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent on 16 December 2014 to remove them from  the  United  Kingdom
    under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The first  and
    second appellants are married to each other.  The  remaining  appellants
    are their children. Although the children are minors I see no reason  to
    restrict reporting. There is nothing in this decision that I  regard  as
    confidential or potentially embarrassing.

 2. On 26 June 2015 the fourth appellant appears to have  become  a  British
    citizen.  He was born in 2005 and, I assume, relied on 10  years  lawful
    residence to establish his claim to citizenship. It seems very  unlikely
    that that appellant can be removed.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed  each these appeals and, before me, it
    was agreed that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal cannot be  right
    because it did not have proper regard to the consequences of one of  the
    children being a British citizen.

 4. The parties further agreed that the  change  of  facts  meant  that  the
    entire decision of the Secretary of State  in  each  case  was  unlawful
    because it was based on facts which are not true and  that  therefore  I
    should set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  substitute
    a decision in each case that the decision is not in accordance with  the
    law. It remains for the Secretary of State to make a lawful decision  in
    each case taking note of the changed status of the fourth appellant.

 5. I therefore make that order as the parties agreed.

    Notice of Decision

 6. The appeal is allowed.
