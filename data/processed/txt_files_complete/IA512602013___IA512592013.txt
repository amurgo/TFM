Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Khan, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are appeals by the above named Appellants  who  are  citizens  of
    Pakistan born respectively on 6th February 1981 and  11th  April  1984.
    Their immigration history is set out as at paragraphs 2 and  3  of  the
    determination of the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  Appellants  had  made
    application  following  previous  leaves  which  had  been  granted  as
    students and thereafter as Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrants  for  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrants  under
    the points-based system and for a biometric  residence  permit.   Those
    applications were refused by the Secretary of State  on  20th  November
    2013.

 2. The Appellants appealed and the appeal came before Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Devittie sitting at Taylor House on 8th August 2014.   In
    a determination promulgated on  12th  September  2014  the  Appellants'
    appeals were dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Appellants lodged Grounds of Appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  and  on
    24th October 2014 Designated Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  McClure
    refused permission to appeal.  The Appellants renewed their application
    for permission to appeal on 13th November 2014 contending within  those
    grounds that Judge McClure had totally ignored the Appellants'  Grounds
    of Appeal and refused to grant permission without engaging  with  those
    grounds.  On 19th December  2014  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Warr  granted
    permission to appeal.  He indicated that there were  a  number  of  odd
    features about the case and that in the Grounds of Appeal  it  was  not
    expressly stated that  the  Presenting  Officer  had  conceded  matters
    although the Appellants had lodged statements stating that they had and
    those statements were dated 4th December 2014.  It was noted  that  the
    renewed Grounds of Appeal differed from  the  earlier  grounds.   Judge
    Warr went on to state

         "I have concluded, not without considerable hesitation, that it  is
         right to grant permission to appeal on the Grounds of Appeal  as  a
         whole.  The Respondent should endeavour to see  if  the  Presenting
         Officer can assist on the issue of the concession".

 4. On 7th January 2015 the Secretary of State lodged  a  response  to  the
    Grounds of Appeal under Rule 24 requesting an oral hearing.  It  is  on
    that basis that the appeal comes before me.

 5. The Appellants appear by their instructed Counsel Mr Khan.  Albeit that
    this is Mr Khan's first involvement with this matter, he has produced a
    very helpful skeleton argument to  supplement  the  Grounds  of  Appeal
    drafted by his colleague Mr Iqbal.  The Secretary of State  appears  by
    her Home Office Presenting Officer  Mr  Shilliday.   Mr  Shilliday  has
    knowledge of this matter being the author of the Rule 24 response.   It
    is on that basis that the appeal proceeds before me solely to determine
    whether there is a material error of law in the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.

Preliminary Issue

 6. I am taken to the point as to whether or not there were any concessions
    made by the Secretary of State.  Helpfully  a  considerable  number  of
    documents have been produced with regard to this.  Mr Khan acknowledges
    that it is accepted that the Grounds of Appeal do not state that  there
    was a concession but that the Appellants  were  under  that  impression
    because no further issues were taken once the  Presenting  Officer  was
    satisfied with the cross-examination  that  the  source  of  funds  was
    consistent.  He submits that whilst the Secretary of  State  may  never
    have made a concession, when there is a point  not  taken  his  clients
    were entitled to conclude that by implication that  was  the  de  facto
    position.

 7. This issue is very thoroughly aired  in  documentation.   Mr  Shilliday
    relies on a witness statement of Amy Cooke.  Ms Cooke  is  a  barrister
    and has appeared on many occasions since August 2012 on behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State in the  First-tier  Tribunal.   She  has  adduced  a
    witness statement which appends an attendance note sent to her  client,
    the Respondent,  the  day  after  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 8. The relevant extract from that attendance note is as follows

         "The Appellants had given consistent evidence on why the money  was
         put into Mr Ayaz's account then put into the joint  account.   Miss
         Habiba said that she gave the remaining money of �2,600 to Mr  Ayaz
         in cash then the cashier said put it all  into  Mr  Ayaz's  account
         then transfer the whole �50,000 to the joint account.  I relied  on
         the refusal letter in this regard but made no further submissions".

    At paragraph 3 of her witness statement Ms Cooke makes reference to the
    issue of money within this attendance note.  In her opinion  she  notes
    that the account given was in her view "consistent" and that she relied
    on the refusal letter in this regard but made no  further  concessions.
    She states that  she  did  not  make  any  concession.   That  view  is
    reaffirmed in the Rule 24  response  served  by  Mr  Shilliday  whereby
    having seen the note and the witness statement of Ms Cooke he states

         "It is denied that there was any concession made before the  First-
         tier Tribunal Judge.  Therefore all matters were  live  before  him
         and he was entitled to  come  to  the  conclusion  he  did  on  the
         evidence.  It is submitted that  the  learned  judge  appropriately
         directed himself and that the determination  contains  no  material
         error".

 9. Thereafter I am taken to Mr  Iqbal's  statement.   Mr  Iqbal,  like  Ms
    Cooke, is a member of the Bar and he was instructed  to  appear  before
    the First-tier Tribunal on the Appellants'  behalf.   He  is  also  the
    author of the Grounds of Appeal.  I am specifically taken by Mr Khan to
    paragraph 9 of his witness statement where he states

         "I am in agreement with what Ms  Cooke  has  said  in  her  witness
         statement and I am also in agreement with the hearing note prepared
         by Ms Cooke.  On behalf of  the  Respondent  both  Appellants  were
         thoroughly cross-examined on the issue of viability and credibility
         of the source of money and then no submissions  were  made  on  the
         Respondent's behalf  challenging  credibility  of  the  Appellant's
         evidence on this very point.  Indeed, it  was  this  point  that  I
         attempted to make in the Grounds of Appeal".

10. All documents fully explain the position.  The arguments can  basically
    be reduced to two sentences.  Mr Shilliday's conclusion  based  on  the
    above that as all matters were live before him the judge  was  entitled
    to come to the conclusion he did on the evidence,  and  to  Mr  Iqbal's
    statement emphasised by Mr Khan both  in  his  skeleton  and  his  oral
    submission that no submissions were made  on  the  Respondent's  behalf
    challenging the credibility of the Appellants' evidence once  they  had
    been thoroughly cross-examined  on  the  issue  of  the  viability  and
    credibility of the source of the money.

General Submissions/Discussions

11. Mr Khan takes me to his skeleton argument.  He submits that the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge ignored the oral evidence given by  the  Appellants
    and that the very  fact  it  is  accepted  they  were  robustly  cross-
    examined, despite this the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to  mention
    that evidence.  He takes me in particular to paragraphs 11  and  12  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge's determination.  He points out  that  at
    paragraph 11 the  judge  had  indicated  that  he  was  satisfied  that
    plausible explanations to most of the concerns raised  in  the  refusal
    letters had been provided, and  that  thereafter  at  paragraph  12  he
    merely mentioned that the Respondent takes issue with the inadequacy of
    the evidence regarding the Appellants' source of funds.  He  reiterates
    the point that Ms Cooke has confirmed that the Appellants' evidence  is
    consistent and that she has no further submissions to make on the point
    and therefore Mr Khan submits that that is proof that the Secretary  of
    State was happy about the position regarding the Appellants' funds.  He
    points out that the judge does not explain the witness  statements  and
    the affidavit from a third party that had  been  provided  at  all  and
    submits that there is, as a result, a failure to  properly  assess  the
    credibility of the Appellants and he relies on the guidance given by Mr
    Justice  Ousley  in  MM  (DRC  -  plausibility)  [2005]  UKIAT   00019,
    submitting that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not  apply  the
    required approach in reaching his credibility findings.  He asked me to
    find that there is a material error of law, to set aside  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal and to  remake  the  decision  allowing  the
    appeal.

12. Mr Shilliday submits that it really is immaterial to  try  and  surmise
    whether or not Ms Cooke on behalf of the Secretary of State was or  was
    not satisfied about the provision of  funds  by  the  Appellants.   The
    important fact is whether or not the judge was persuaded  that  he  was
    satisfied and it was clear from his determination that he was not.   He
    submits  that  paragraph  16  of  the   First-tier   Tribunal   Judge's
    determination is fatal to the Appellants' appeal.  He points  out  that
    the Appellants can have no complaint given that they were  allowed  the
    opportunity to provide evidence and that once that  evidence  had  been
    provided they still failed to persuade the judge.  He acknowledges that
    perhaps the judge should have made further reference  to  the  evidence
    but the fact that he did not specifically refer to it, bearing in  mind
    the conclusions reached at paragraph 16, do not constitute an error  of
    law.  Further he submits that the approach adopted in seeking  to  rely
    on MM (DRC - plausibility) Democratic Republic of  Congo  [2005]  UKIAT
    00019  is  wrong  in  that  that  was  an  asylum  appeal  and  it   is
    inappropriate where there is a lower standard of proof to try and apply
    an asylum authority to the evidence that is provided in a  points-based
    system appeal.  He submits that there is no material error of  law  and
    he asked me to dismiss the Appellants' appeal.



The Law

13.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account   immaterial   consideration,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

14. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

15.  Applications  for  leave  to  remain  as  Tier  1  entrepreneurs   are
    acknowledged as being complex.  The Rule requirements need to be met to
    the letter.  One of the requirements is that applicants genuinely  need
    to have access to at least �50,000 to invest in their business and that
    the money is disposable in the United Kingdom.  The Secretary of  State
    in refusing the Appellants' application was  not  satisfied  that  such
    monies were available and consequently refused  the  application  under
    paragraph 245DD(k) of the Immigration Rules which provides that if  the
    Secretary of State  is  not  satisfied  with  the  genuineness  of  the
    application in relation to a points-scoring requirement in  Appendix  A
    those points will not be awarded.  Other concerns raised in the refusal
    letter were addressed  at  paragraph  11  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's determination where the judge accepted that the Appellants  had
    provided plausible explanations to most of the concerns raised  in  the
    refusal letter, such as the poor quality of the website, the allegation
    that the website was plagiarised and the claim that the  business  plan
    was also plagiarised.  However, he found that the Appellants had  still
    failed to adequately explain the source of funds available and that the
    Respondent  had  taken  issue  with  the  inadequacy  of  the  evidence
    regarding their source of funds.

16. Much has been made by Mr Khan and previously by Mr Iqbal in the Grounds
    of Appeal that the failure of the Secretary of State  to  cross-examine
    on this point constitutes to all intents and purposes a concession that
    the Secretary of State was satisfied with regard to the adequacy of the
    funds.  It is now, for reasons set out in some detail  above,  accepted
    that there was no concession on this point.  The issue  remains  as  to
    whether or not the finding of the First-tier Tribunal Judge was in such
    circumstances plausible.

17. I am satisfied that it was and I agree with the detailed comments  made
    with regard to paragraph 16 of the determination by Mr Shilliday.   The
    judge has at paragraphs 11 to 14 set out the factual analysis  that  he
    has made with regard to the provision of such funds.  He has considered
    the provisions of paragraph 245DD of the Immigration Rules and  he  has
    made findings which he is entitled to make.  It is  important  to  note
    the judge has set out that  he  has  considered  the  evidence  in  its
    totality, including the documentary evidence and the explanations  that
    had been offered by the Appellant.  I acknowledge that  merely  stating
    that does  not  guarantee  that  there  is  no  error  of  law  in  the
    determination but when looked at as a whole it is clear  that  in  this
    instant case the judge has considered fully the provision of funds  and
    has concluded having heard the evidence that the Appellants had  failed
    to prove to him the sources  of  their  funds.   The  judge  heard  the
    evidence and he thereafter made conclusions that  they  had  failed  to
    show to him that they had established on  a  balance  of  probabilities
    that they had genuinely intended to invest in the  United  Kingdom  and
    that the funds in the account would remain available to them for use in
    the business.

18. In such circumstances I am satisfied that this was a finding  that  the
    judge  was  entitled  to  make.   Submissions   consequently   of   the
    Appellants' legal representatives amount to nothing more than  argument
    and disagreement.  I remind myself that it is not the role of the Upper
    Tribunal to per se rehear matters merely because one party or the other
    disagrees with the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  Upper
    Tribunal's role inter alia is to correct errors.   This  decision  does
    not disclose any errors and whilst it is always debatable as to whether
    or not another  judge  would  or  would  have  not  come  to  the  same
    conclusion, the fact remains that Judge Devittie heard all the evidence
    and  made  findings  of  fact  that  he  was  entitled  to.   In   such
    circumstances the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  discloses  no
    material error of law and the Appellants' appeal is dismissed  and  the
    decision of the Secretary of State is maintained.

Notice of Decision
