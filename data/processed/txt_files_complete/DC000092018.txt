Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Turner, Imperium Chambers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless we  will  refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    described before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  that  is  Mr  [P]  as  the
    appellant and the Secretary of State as the respondent.

 2. Following a hearing on 1st May 2019 we promulgated a  decision  on  2nd
    May 2019 finding an error of law in the determination of the First-tier
    Tribunal dated 21st February 2019, which had allowed the appeal against
    the decision of the Secretary of State  dated  14th  February  2018  to
    deprive the appellant of British citizenship under Section 40(3) of the
    Nationality Act 1981.  We set aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) in order to remake the  decision  under
    section 12(2) (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007 which we now proceed to do.

 3. The full history and background  to  the  appeal  is  set  out  in  our
    appended error of law decision.  Our  reasons  for  setting  aside  the
    decision are contained in that determination.

 4. By way of history, the appellant had been granted entry to  the  United
    Kingdom as a student in 2002  and  applied  for  subsequent  grants  of
    further leave. On 16th July 2010 the he applied for  further  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  1  General  migrant.   He  was
    required to show an income of at  least  �40,000  and  he  declared  an
    income of �43,625. One  of  the  companies  from  which  the  appellant
    derived an income in the relevant period was IT  Verticals.   The  Home
    Office subsequently mounted  an  investigation,  through  an  operation
    named Cudgegong, of a number of companies involved in facilitating self-
    employment for those who were seeking leave to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom. The investigation revealed a scam perpetrated by, inter  alia,
    IT Verticals, which recycled money through bogus companies  to  falsely
    inflate income for applications for immigration leave purposes.

 5. The Secretary of State in the deprivation decision  asserted  that  the
    appellant had engaged the services of, for  example,  IT  Verticals  to
    inflate his income for the purposes of obtaining leave in 2010 and thus
    fraudulently.  His subsequent grant of Indefinite Leave  to  Remain  on
    27th January 2013 on the basis of 10 years lawful  residence  was  also
    obtained by fraud.  Had that information been before the respondent the
    appellant would not have been granted Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain  or
    following that British nationality by  naturalisation  on  27th  August
    2014.

 6. The Secretary of State exercised his discretion under section 40 (3)(c)
    of the British Nationality Act 1981 and the  decision,  expressly  made
    reference to  the  Nationality  Instructions  and  confirmed  that  the
    appellant  failed  to  disclose  previous  immigration  fraud  in   his
    application  for  naturalisation.   The  Secretary  of  State  in   his
    deprivation decision recorded at paragraph 10 that the  appellant  made
    an application as a Tier 1  Highly  Skilled-General  Migrant  and  this
    application was successful.  Finally, on 27th June 2012, the  appellant
    lodged a Long Residency (10 year) application and on 27th January  2013
    the appellant was finally granted  Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain  which
    ultimately led to his application for  British  citizenship  which  was
    granted on 27th August 2014. It was concluded at  paragraphs  11-30  of
    the  deprivation  decision  that  this  was  through   deception.   The
    assessment was made on the balance of probabilities.  The Secretary  of
    State wrote to advise the appellant that he was  considering  depriving
    him of his British citizenship because he had used  fraud  and  invited
    his submissions to which his legal  representatives  responded  on  1st
    March 2017 and  14th  June  2017.   In  the  deprivation  decision  the
    Secretary of State referred to  'Chapter  18  and  The  Good  Character
    Requirements' and noted that

         'the Secretary of State must be satisfied that an applicant  is  of
         good character on the  balance  of  probabilities.   To  facilitate
         this, applicants must answer all questions asked of them during the
         application process honestly and in full'.

    The decision noted at paragraph 32

         'in view of your involvement in immigration fraud,  as  highlighted
         in the above paragraphs, it is clear that you were not a person who
         could be considered of good character and you deliberately withheld
         information that would have had a bearing on whether  or  not  your
         application succeeded'.

    Further at paragraph 32 the Secretary of State wrote

         'To support further the view that you were not  of  good  character
         reference is also made to the document that would have  accompanied
         your naturalisation application form, Guide AN Naturalisation as  a
         British Citizen -A guide for applicants (Annex C -refers).  Section
         3: Good Character states the following:  Sub  Section  3.7  -  3.12
         states: You must say whether you have  been  involved  in  anything
         which might indicate that you are not of good character.  You  must
         give information about any of these activities no matter  how  long
         ago  this  was.   Checks  will  be  made  in  all  cases  and  your
         application may fail and your fee will not be fully refunded if you
         man(sic) an untruthful declaration.  If you are in any doubt  about
         whether you have done something, or it has been  alleged  that  you
         have done something which might lead us to think that you  are  not
         of good character you should say so'.

 7. In our error of law decision we specifically preserved the findings  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  at  paragraphs  39  to  45  in  relation  to
    deception.  The findings of the First-tier Tribunal were not subject to
    any challenge and are as follows:

         "[39]    I believe  I  have  the  following  issues  before  me  to
         determine.  Firstly, whether the Respondent had established, on the
         balance of probabilities and not on a higher standard of  proof  as
         suggested by the appellant's representatives,  that  the  appellant
         was knowingly involved in the fraud.  If so, secondly,  whether  he
         had shown that he  had  motivated  the  grant  of  citizenship  and
         therefore necessarily precluded that grant. In other words, whether
         the deception had motivated the acquisition  of  that  citizenship.
         Lastly, whether I am  satisfied  that  the  reasonably  foreseeable
         consequence of the deprivation would violate the obligations of the
         United Kingdom government under the Human Rights  Act  1998  and/or
         there was some exceptional feature of  the  case  which  meant  the
         discretion should have been exercised differently.  These questions
         are instilled from the  guidance  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  the
         decisions that I have referred to above.

         [40]     The appellant was born on 24 May 1978.   He  came  to  the
         United Kingdom on 20 July 2002 when he was 24 years  old.   He  was
         educated in India and came to  the  UK  for  further  studies.   He
         completed his studies and made the  2010  application  for  further
         leave to remain when he was 32 years old.  As his  academic  record
         had shown, he is a very bright and intelligent man.

         [41]     On 30 October 2009 and  16  January  2010,  the  Appellant
         received a total of �5,000 from IT Verticals which  he  claimed  in
         respect of services rendered.  Immediately before  receiving  those
         payments, he had himself paid into  the  account  of  IT  Verticals
         �2100 on 27 October 2009 (RBI, F6) and �1500  on  18  January  2010
         (AB1, F7).  The appellant claimed before me that  he  had  provided
         services to IT Verticals in terms of  training  for  which  he  was
         paid, and he had issued invoices to  them.   However,  he  had  not
         explained  why  he  himself  had  made  payments  to  IT  Verticals
         immediately before they made  payments  to  him  in  the  decision,
         similar method of recycling money was followed in  respect  of  the
         other

         In the absence of a credible explanation, it is clear  to  me  that
         the money was recycled to look like the Appellant was  earning  the
         money as a self-employed person.  As the Respondent  noted  in  the
         decision, a similar method  of  recycling  money  was  followed  in
         respect of the other company.  The Appellant had made  payments  to
         Juluru who was connected  with  the  whole  fraud  operation.   The
         Appellant would have me believe that Juluru was known to  him  from
         India and the payments that he  made  were  to  discharge  personal
         debts.  He also referred to some monies being transferred from  his
         account into his personal account and yet provided no personal bank
         accounts for the relevant period'. [41]

         [42]     It is my finding that the Appellant was  clearly  involved
         in the scam set up by those who were running IT Verticals  and  the
         other companies.    The  appellant  claimed  that  he  went  to  IT
         Verticals as recommended by a friend.   I  totally  discount  that.
         The appellant was known to those who were  running  the  companies.
         He knew what he was doing.  Had his involvement with the scam  gone
         a little further than simply utilising their illegitimate  services
         of recycling his own money, he  too  may  have  been  arrested  and
         possibly prosecuted.  He was  not  a  na�ve  person  but  a  highly
         educated man.

         [43]     The respondent never  suggested  that  the  appellant  was
         himself involved in setting up or running the scam. His  role  was,
         and  I  accept  that  assertion,  to  benefit  from  the  scam   by
         circulating his own money around to give the impression that  money
         had been earned  by  him  as  a  self-employed  person.  He  issued
         invoices to IT Verticals which in fact were settled  with  his  own
         money with the result that no money was earned  on  self-employment
         basis insofar as those funds  were  concerned.   I  find  that  the
         appellant was knowingly involved in the scam as the beneficiary  of
         the scam, in order to qualify himself for further leave  to  remain
         by showing that his total yearly earnings were  at  least  �40,000.
         The  appellant  has  provided  no  innocent  explanation   of   his
         involvement in the scandal as the  beneficiary.  I  therefore  find
         that the respondent has discharged the  burden  of  proof  in  that
         regard.

         [44]     For the same reasons as mentioned above, I find that there
         was no evidence before  me  of  an  innocent  explanation  for  the
         appellant's involvement in the scam as one of the beneficiaries.

         [45]     To summarise, I find that the Respondent has  established,
         on the balance of probabilities, that the Appellant was involved in
         the scam as a beneficiary which led to the respondent granting  him
         the 2010 leave to remain.  He was involved in  the  scam  knowingly
         and there was no innocent explanation for his involvement."

 8. The British Nationality Act 1982 reads as follows




      Section 40

      ...

      "(2) The Secretary of State may by order deprive a person of a
      citizenship status if the Secretary of State is satisfied that
      deprivation is conducive to the public good.




      (3) The Secretary of State may by order deprive a person of a
      citizenship status which results from his registration or
      naturalisation if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the
      registration or naturalisation was obtained by means of-

           (a)fraud,

           (b)false representation, or

           (c)concealment of a material fact.

      (4) The Secretary of State may not make an order under subsection (2)
      if he is satisfied that the order would make a person stateless.

      ..."

 9. The above  may  apply  to  a  person  where  the  person  acquired  the
    citizenship or status as  a  result  of  his  or  her  registration  or
    naturalisation on or after 1st January 1983.

10. Chapter 55 of the Nationality Instructions is entitled 'Deprivation and
    Nullity of British citizenship' and sets out

         '55.4    Definitions

         55.4.1   "False representation" means a  representation  which  was
         dishonestly made on the applicant's part i.e. an  innocent  mistake
         would not give rise to a power  to  order  deprivation  under  this
         provision.

      2. "Concealment of any material fact" means operative concealment i.e.
         the concealment practised by the applicant must have had  a  direct
         bearing on the decision to register or, as  the  case  may  be,  to
         issue a certificate of naturalisation.

         55.4.3   "Fraud" encompasses either of the above.

         55.4.4   "Conduciveness to the Public Good" means depriving in  the
         public  interest  on  the  grounds  of  involvement  in  terrorism,
         espionage, serious organised  crime,  war  crimes  or  unacceptable
         behaviours.'

11. Paragraph 55.7 reads as follows:

         '55.7    Material to the Acquisition of Citizenship

         55.7.1   If the relevant facts, had they been known at the time the
         application for citizenship was considered, would have affected the
         decision to grant citizenship via  naturalisation  or  registration
         the caseworker should consider deprivation.

         55.7.2   This will include but is not limited to:

                . Undisclosed convictions or other information  which  would
                have affected a person's ability to meet the good  character
                requirement

                . A marriage/civil partnership which is found to be  invalid
                or void, and so would have affected a  person's  ability  to
                meet the requirements for section 6(2)

                . False details given  in  relation  to  an  immigration  or
                asylum application, which led to that status being given  to
                a person who would not  otherwise  have  qualified,  and  so
                would have affected a person's ability to meet the residence
                and/or good character  requirements  for  naturalisation  or
                registration

         55.7.3   If the  fraud,  false  representation  or  concealment  of
         material fact did not  have  a  direct  bearing  on  the  grant  of
         citizenship, it will  not  be  appropriate  to  pursue  deprivation
         action.

         ...

         55.7.7   Deliberate

         55.7.7.1 The caseworker should  be  satisfied  that  there  was  an
         intention to deceive: an innocent error or genuine omission  should
         not lead to deprivation.'

12. The preserved finding  at  paragraph  45  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination above found that the appellant was indeed involved in the
    scam which led to the grant of the 2010  leave  to  remain.  Thus,  the
    leave granted in 2010 was on the  basis  of  partly  false  information
    about the appellant's self-employed earnings which he had submitted  to
    the respondent in support of his 2010 application.

13. The Secretary of State's deprivation decision at paragraph 31 recorded

         "31       At  Section  3:  Good  Character   Requirement   of   the
         naturalisation application form which  you  completed  (Annex  A  -
         Naturalisation Application Form refers) sub section 3.18 it states:

             Have you ever engaged in  any  other  activities  which  might
             indicate that you may not  be  considered  a  person  of  good
             character, you ticked the box marked 'No'.   Your  application
             form is dated 23/03/2014, which means you indicated  you  were
             of good  character  even  though  you  have  been  engaged  in
             immigration fraud prior to lodging your application."

14. As set out above in the Secretary  of  State  deprivation  decision  at
    paragraphs 32-33 the Secretary of State found that  the  applicant  had
    not disclosed his  activities  and  was  not  of  good  character.   At
    paragraphs 34 and 36 the Secretary of State noted

           "... it is clear from the guidance that was in place at the time
           of your application [for naturalisation] that  you  deliberately
           withheld your illegal activities in initially obtaining leave to
           remain in the United Kingdom via immigration fraud.   Ultimately
           this fraud then assisted you in obtaining  British  citizenship.
           It is evidence that you are not of good character  and  if  your
           activities had been known to the  nationality  caseworker,  your
           application would have failed the good character requirement"

           "For the reasons given above it  is  not  accepted  there  is  a
           plausible, innocent explanation for the  misleading  information
           which led to the decision to grant citizenship in  circumstances
           where your application(s) would have been  unsuccessful  if  you
           had told the truth.  It is therefore considered that  the  fraud
           was deliberate and material to the acquisition.

           It is acknowledged that the decision to deprive on  the  grounds
           of fraud is at the Secretary of State 's discretion."

15. BA (deprivation of citizenship: appeals) [2018] UKUT 00085 (IAC) held:

         "(1)     In an appeal under section 40A of the British  Nationality
         Act 1981, the Tribunal must first establish  whether  the  relevant
         condition precedent in section 40(2) or (3) exists for the exercise
         of the Secretary of State's discretion to deprive a person  (P)  of
         British citizenship.

         (2)      In a section 40(2) case, the fact that  the  Secretary  of
         State is satisfied that deprivation is conducive to the public good
         is to be given very significant weight and will  almost  inevitably
         be determinative of that issue.

         (3)      In a section  40(3)  case,  the  Tribunal  must  establish
         whether one or more of the means described  in  subsection  (3)(a),
         (b) and (c) were used by P in order to obtain British  citizenship.
         As held in Pirzada (Deprivation of citizenship: general principles)
         [2017] UKUT  196  (IAC)  the  deception  must  have  motivated  the
         acquisition of that citizenship."

16. The questions are (i) whether the failure to disclose the fraud in  the
    naturalisation application at question  3.18  was  dishonest  and  (ii)
    motivated the grant of  naturalisation.   Bearing  in  mind  the  clear
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal which we preserved  and  identified
    above, which found the appellant had been involved in a fraud in  order
    to obtain his 2010 grant of leave, the Secretary of State has shown  on
    the balance of probabilities that the appellant was indeed dishonest in
    his previous obtaining of leave.  In his application for naturalisation
    the applicant did not disclose that he had engaged in activities  which
    would indicate he was not a person of good character.  As found by  the
    First-tier Tribunal the appellant had undertaken a fraud to obtain  his
    previous leave and he chose not to  disclose  that  in  his  subsequent
    applications including that for naturalisation.  Indeed, the  appellant
    denied that he had undertaken any type of fraud.   As set out in detail
    by the Secretary of State the applicant had engaged in  fraud  and  had
    failed to disclose and concealed that fact.

17. It is clear that the concealment was material and as set out under  the
    Nationality Instructions: it fell  within  the  last  bullet  point  of
    55.7.2

         'False details given  in  relation  to  an  immigration  or  asylum
         application, which led to that status being given to a  person  who
         would not otherwise have qualified, and so would  have  affected  a
         person's ability  to  meet  the  residence  and/or  good  character
         requirements for naturalisation or registration'

18. In effect false details were given in  the  2010  application  and  not
    disclosed in the later 2014 naturalisation application.

19. The correct interpretation of  'motivated'  must  be  the  natural  and
    ordinary meaning, such that the Secretary of State was  prompted,  lead
    or  influenced  to  grant  the  naturalisation  on  the  basis  of  the
    information or lack of information provided.  Had the true  facts  been
    known the decision-maker, that is that  the  appellant  had  previously
    committed fraud, the Secretary of State would not have been 'motivated'
    to grant the application. Section 40 (3) (c) refers to concealment of a
    material fact in the naturalisation application  itself.   It  was  the
    absence of information, or rather  concealment,  as  explained  by  the
    Secretary of State in his deprivation  decision,  that  influenced  the
    grant.

20. Mr Turner argued that BA had made it  clear  that  only  acts  directly
    related to the acquisition of  nationality  should  be  considered  and
    adopted  a  restrictive  approach.   We  reject  that  approach.    The
    appellant had originally obtained  leave  through  fraud  which  was  a
    criminal offence under Section 24 of  the  Immigration  Act  1971.   It
    cannot be argued that this was too remote. In Sleiman  (deprivation  of
    Citizenship; conduct) [2017] UKUT 00367 it was held that in  an  appeal
    against a decision to deprive a person of citizenship because of fraud,
    false representation of a material fact, the impugned behaviour must be
    'directly material' to the decision  to  grant  citizenship.   In  this
    case, there was a direct material link between  the  obtaining  of  the
    grant of leave in 2010 and the  obtaining  of  the  naturalisation  was
    evident.  In particular, the deception took place prior to the grant of
    leave in 2010 and the ongoing reliance on that grant  was  instrumental
    in the  ultimate  naturalisation.  The  grant  of  leave  in  2010  was
    axiomatic to the grant of naturalisation and indeed there  was  ongoing
    misrepresentation  as  to  the  obtaining  of  the  2010  grant   which
    underpinned the naturalisation and the grant of citizenship.

21. Even if that were not the case  the  Secretary  of  State  has  clearly
    identified that concealment was deployed in the obtaining the grant and
    the provisions as to direct materiality apply equally  to  concealment.
    Albeit only one subsection is required, we conclude that  both  Section
    40 (3) (b) and (c) apply in this case.

22. BA (deprivation of citizenship: appeals) [2018] UKUT 00085  (IAC)  also
    held

         "(4)     In both section 40(2) and (3) cases,  the  fact  that  the
         Secretary of State has decided in the exercise of her discretion to
         deprive P of British citizenship will in practice mean the Tribunal
         can  allow  P's  appeal  only  if  satisfied  that  the  reasonably
         foreseeable  consequence   of   deprivation   would   violate   the
         obligations of the United Kingdom government under the Human Rights
         Act 1998 and/or that there is some exceptional feature of the  case
         which means the discretion in the subsection  concerned  should  be
         exercised differently.

         (5)      As can be seen from AB (British citizenship:  deprivation:
         Deliallisi  considered)  (Nigeria)  [2016]  UKUT  451  (IAC),   the
         stronger P's case appears to the Tribunal to be for  resisting  any
         future (post-deprivation) removal on ECHR grounds, the less  likely
         it will be that P's removal from the United Kingdom will be one  of
         the foreseeable consequences of deprivation.

         (6)      The appeal  is  to  be  determined  by  reference  to  the
         evidence adduced to the Tribunal, whether or not the same  evidence
         was before the Secretary of State when she  made  her  decision  to
         deprive."

23. At the hearing we permitted Mr Turner to  submit  further  information,
    under Rule 15(2)A of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    for the assessment of  Article  8  within  the  compass  of  reasonably
    foreseeable circumstances, in particular statelessness.  We made  clear
    that we did not accept  his  evidence  in  relation  to  the  deception
    findings which had already been decided by the First-tier Tribunal  and
    which had been preserved.

24. The appellant and his wife adopted their statements.    The  appellant,
    aged 41 years, had been in the UK for 17 years and  developed  personal
    and social ties here.  He was by profession a data  analyst  with  many
    years of experience.  His wife, also a British citizen, had come to the
    UK in 2010 from India and was settled in her job.  She was in  the  Top
    50 for Engineering but she wished at the age of 37 years wished to have
    children. As a couple they were undergoing  fertility  treatment  which
    would be difficult to recommence should they have to return  to  India.
    The appellant was  now  however  undergoing  low  moods  and  financial
    strain.  There was medical evidence from his GP, Dr Shah  that  he  had
    been suffering with low mood for several months and this was  affecting
    his sleep and he was stressed.  It would be  an  'uphill  struggle'  to
    remake life elsewhere and it would be difficult to obtain work  now  at
    the age of 41 years.  Furthermore, he no longer had Indian nationality.
    The appellant and his wife  had  also  bought  a  home  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

25. Mr Melvin submitted in a  Rule  24  written  response  that  given  the
    marriage to a  British  citizen,  the  appellant's  application  'would
    succeed  with  reference  to   the   Immigration   Rules   to   acquire
    discretionary leave as the spouse of a British citizen'.   He  did  not
    wish to give an oral undertaking but it was the  Secretary  of  State's
    position that the decision to revoke his British citizenship would  not
    reveal circumstances that demonstrated a breach of the Human Rights Act
    1998.

26. Mr Turner countered that the appellant could not fulfil the Immigration
    Rules owing to the application of the suitability requirements.  It was
    most likely that  the  Secretary  of  State  would  reject  any  future
    application on the basis of the presence of  the  appellant  not  being
    conducive to the public good because his conduct or character would  be
    deemed undesirable to allow him to remain in the  UK  (S-SLTR  1.6)  or
    further to paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

27. In relation to statelessness, we were taken through  the  documentation
    which showed that the appellant had revoked his Indian passport in 2014
    and was no longer an Indian national.  Mr Turner resisted  Mr  Melvin's
    submission that an Overseas Citizen of India Card ('OCI') was available
    which entitles the holder to travel to and from India and to reside and
    work there without restriction. That did not afford Indian citizenship.
      However, Mr Turner submitted there was no evidence of  insurmountable
    obstacles to the appellant's relocation to India and little by  way  of
    exceptional circumstances.  The medical factors in the appellant's case
    would not assist his Article 8 claim.

28. Mr Melvin did not accept that the appellant would not be  able  to  re-
    acquire Indian citizenship and we were referred to Part V of the  India
    Citizenship Rules 2009 [Renunciation and Deprivation of Citizenship  of
    India], Section 24 which detailed the  route  to  re-acquisition.   The
    Indian Citizenship Act 1955 (as amended) was  not  produced  by  either
    party.

29. Deliallasi (British citizen: deprivation  appeal:  Scope)  [2013]  UKUT
    00439(IAC), recognised that Section  40A  of  the  1981  Act  does  not
    involve any statutory hypotheses that the  appellant  will  be  removed
    from the UK in consequence of the deprivation decision but  found  that
    the Tribunal  is  required  to  determine  the  reasonably  foreseeable
    consequences of deprivation which may depending on  the  facts  include
    removal.

30.  In  relation  to  Article  8  following   AB   (British   Citizenship:
    deprivation; Deliallisi considered) Nigeria [2016] UKUT 00451,

         "(2)     Whilst the  Tribunal  considering  a  section  40A  appeal
         cannot pre-judge the outcome of any future legal challenge that the
         appellant might bring  against  a  decision  to  remove,  following
         deprivation, the Tribunal must  nevertheless  take  a  view  as  to
         whether, from its present vantage point,  there  is  likely  to  be
         force in any future challenge: cf section 94  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  and  paragraph  353   of   the
         immigration rules. The stronger the potential case, the less likely
         it  will  be  that  the  reasonably  foreseeable  consequences   of
         deprivation will include removal."

31. It is clear from the authorities that if the appellant is  deprived  of
    British citizenship he would not fall to be  treated  as  someone  with
    Indefinite Leave to Remain.  On acquisition of British citizenship, his
    Indefinite Leave to Remain was  extinguished.  The  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971.

32. According to BA (deprivation of citizenship: appeals) the Tribunal  can
    allow  the  appellant's  appeal  only  if  the  reasonably  foreseeable
    consequence of deprivation would violate the obligations of the  United
    Kingdom or that there is some other  exceptional  feature  which  means
    that discretion should be exercised differently.    In AB and prior  to
    this conclusion the Tribunal found that if the appellant had a strongly
    arguable human rights claim which if rejected by the  respondent  would
    have at least a realistic prospect of success before a Tribunal it  was
    not reasonably likely that the appellant would indeed be  removed  from
    the UK and thus the appellant's human rights would not be so  breached.



33. Mr Turner specifically argued  that  a  weaker  Article  8  case  would
    increase the chances of success in the deprivation matter. We were not,
    however, directed  by  the  representatives  to  the  Court  of  Appeal
    authority in Aziz v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 1884 and KV (R on  the  application  of)  Secretary  of  State
    [2018] EWCA Civ 2483.  We were surprised as Mr Turner appeared  in  KV.
    Nonetheless, at paragraph 24 of Aziz, and which predated KV,  Sales  LJ
    held the following in relation to the proleptic analysis of what  might
    ultimately happen

         '24.     Conversely, by this reasoning, the weaker the case for the
         individual,  the  more  likely  it  will  be  that  the  reasonably
         foreseeable consequences of deprivation will include  removal  from
         the UK, which presumably should then be brought into  account  when
         considering whether  deprivation  of  citizenship  is  lawful.  The
         effect is to draw the tribunal  into  considering  on  a  proleptic
         basis the legal merits in relation to deportation or removal of  an
         individual, as the FTT did in the present cases under appeal'.

         ...

         In my judgment, the Secretary of State and, in turn, the  FTT  were
         entitled to make these assessments. It was unnecessary for the  FTT
         to go further, as it did in each  case,  and  conduct  a  proleptic
         analysis of whether each appellant would be likely to  be  deported
         or removed at a later stage. The Secretary  of  State  had  already
         been successful in showing that the making of a  deprivation  order
         in each case would be lawful and compatible with Convention rights,
         without needing to go on to establish whether the  appellant  would
         or could lawfully be deported later on. It  was  known  that  if  a
         deportation order was  sought  to  be  made  after  deprivation  of
         citizenship had occurred, the relevant  appellant  would  have  the
         opportunity of making representations and  presenting  full  up-to-
         date evidence at that stage to contest the making of such an order;
         and that he would have a  full  right  of  appeal  to  present  his
         arguments and relevant up-to-date evidence to the  FTT.  Since  the
         rights of the appellants and their children as regards  deportation
         (as distinct  from  deprivation  of  citizenship)  would  be  fully
         protected by the procedures to be followed  at  that  later  stage,
         there was in these cases no possibility that the making of an order
         of deprivation of citizenship at the earlier stage could itself  be
         assessed to be incompatible with their Article 8 rights or with the
         duty under section 55 by reason that there might  ultimately  be  a
         deportation later on'.

34. In this case, we were not persuaded that there would be  any  violation
    of the appellant's human rights on the deprivation decision itself.  We
    note that Section 40 (4) of the British Nationality whereby  there  may
    be no deprivation if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the order
    would make a person stateless (with some caveats)  does  not  apply  to
    Section 40(3), that is to a person who has citizenship  resulting  from
    his registration or naturalisation.  The deprivation must, nonetheless,
    be compliant with Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

35. With regard the argument on statelessness, in KV (R on the  application
    of) Secretary of State  [2018] EWCA Civ 2483 Leggatt LJ said this:

      1. It is a further question whether the  exercise  of  the  discretion
         should be approached on the basis that deprivation  of  citizenship
         involves interference with a right and that any  such  interference
         should be no greater than is necessary to  achieve  the  legitimate
         aim of the interference. It is well established that such a test of
         proportionality is applicable where there is  interference  with  a
         right protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, such as
         the right to  respect  for  a  person's  private  and  family  life
         guaranteed  by  article  8.  However,   although   deprivation   of
         citizenship may result in interference with article 8  rights,  the
         right to a nationality is not itself a right protected by the Human
         Rights Convention.

      1. Although a right not to be made stateless is recognised under other
         international treaties, no such right applies in  a  case  where  a
         person's nationality has been obtained  by  fraud.  In  particular,
         article  8(1)  of  the  1961  Convention  on   the   Reduction   of
         Statelessness (which the UK has ratified) prohibits deprivation  of
         nationality which would render  a  person  stateless;  but  article
         8(2)(b) provides  an  exception  where  the  nationality  has  been
         obtained by misrepresentation or fraud. Likewise, article 7(1)  and
         (3) of the 1997 European Convention on Nationality  (which  the  UK
         has not in fact ratified) does not  prohibit  a  state  party  from
         depriving a person of his nationality, even if he  thereby  becomes
         stateless,  when  that  nationality  was  acquired  by   means   of
         fraudulent  conduct,  false  information  or  concealment  of   any
         relevant fact attributable to the applicant. More broadly,  article
         15 of the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights,  adopted  by  the
         United Nations General Assembly in 1951, declares that everyone has
         the right to a nationality and that no  one  shall  be  arbitrarily
         deprived of his nationality. But as the CJEU recognised in Rottmann
         v Friestadt Bayern (Case C-135/08) [2010] QB 761, para 53,  when  a
         state deprives a person of  his  nationality  because  of  acts  of
         deception,  legally  established,  that   deprivation   cannot   be
         considered to be an arbitrary act.

      1. Where, as in the present case, it  is  established  not  only  that
         deception was  used  but  that,  without  it,  an  application  for
         naturalisation as a citizen would not have been granted,  it  seems
         to me that it will be an unusual case in which  the  applicant  can
         legitimately complain of the  withdrawal  of  the  rights  that  he
         acquired as  a  result  of  naturalisation.  That  is  because  the
         withdrawal of those rights does  no  more  than  place  the  person
         concerned in the same position as if he had not been fraudulent and
         had acted honestly in making the application. The position  may  be
         different, however, in a case where, as a result of naturalisation,
         the individual has lost other rights previously enjoyed which  will
         not  or  may  not  be  restored  if  he  is  now  deprived  of  his
         citizenship. In such a case depriving  the  person  of  citizenship
         will not simply return him to the status quo ante  but  will  place
         him in a worse position than if he had not been granted citizenship
         in the first place.

      1. That may occur where a person who was a national of  another  state
         has lost that nationality as a result of becoming a British citizen
         and would not be entitled  to  resume  his  former  nationality  if
         deprived of his British citizenship. In such a case  the  decision-
         maker (whether it be the Secretary of State or the tribunal  on  an
         appeal) will need to consider whether deprivation of citizenship is
         justified having regard to that consequence.  Relevant  factors  in
         making that determination are likely to include both the nature and
         circumstances of the deception by means of which naturalisation was
         obtained but also, on the other side of the scales, the  likelihood
         (if any) that the individual would be able to re-acquire his former
         citizenship and the extent to which the inability  to  do  so  will
         have practical  detrimental  consequences  for  the  individual  or
         others. Although  it  does  not  seem  to  me  necessary  that  the
         assessment should have to be conducted using the formal four  stage
         test of proportionality adopted in cases such as Bank Mellat  v  HM
         Treasury (No 2) [2013] UKSC 39; [2014] AC 700,  para  74,  it  will
         necessarily involve a balancing  exercise  and  a  judgment  as  to
         whether in all the  circumstances  deprivation  of  citizenship  is
         proportionate.

36. First, although we recognise that the OCI would entitle  the  appellant
    to travel, work and residence in India, all of which were  significant,
    we realise that it does not entail citizenship.  We were not,  however,
    persuaded that the appellant, on the evidence provided, would be unable
    to obtain Indian citizenship because at  page  28  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle there was  specific  reference  to  the  acquisition  of  Indian
    citizenship at 2 ii by a person of  Indian  origin  who  is  ordinarily
    resident in any country or place outside undivided  India.   There  was
    nothing before us to the effect that having once revoked citizenship it
    could not be re-acquired. Without specific expert evidence we cannot to
    conclude that the appellant would be unable to re-acquire  citizenship.
    That said, as Mr Turner argued in his grounds of appeal, the  appellant
    has revoked his Indian citizenship and the Secretary of State would  be
    likely to grant some form of limited leave whilst he  attempts  to  re-
    acquire citizenship.  There is, however, no decision on removal.

37. In effect the burden of proving statelessness lay  with  the  appellant
    and at it requires evidence of foreign law  which,  under  the  general
    rule can only be done by adducing evidence from an expert  witness  and
    as stated at [26] of KV

         'Likewise, I see no  reason  why,  before  depriving  a  person  of
         citizenship on the ground that his naturalisation as a citizen  was
         obtained by fraud, the Secretary of State  should  be  required  to
         investigate whether that person has,  or  previously  had,  another
         nationality. If a person  who  has  been  shown  to  have  obtained
         citizenship by fraud wishes to argue that  he  should  nevertheless
         not be deprived of his citizenship because this would have  further
         particular adverse consequences in his case over and above the loss
         of citizenship itself, then it seems to me that the burden must lie
         on him to identify and prove the further consequences on  which  he
         seeks to rely. That includes any assertion that the person will  be
         made stateless'.

38. We considered the questions  of  whether  the  appellant  could  resume
    citizenship and had a realistic prospect of the same was material.

39.  We  repeat  that  we  had  specifically  directed  that  evidence   on
    statelessness should be provided at the resumed hearing. In the context
    of Indian law, which in the  documentation  provided  is  described  as
    difficult, expert evidence  might  have  been  expected  to  have  been
    provided to confirm that appellant would be rendered statelessness  and
    without prospect of resumption of citizenship.  That said, KV found the
    requirement for  expert  evidence  was  not  always  required  and  the
    documentation provided in this instance pointed to  the  position  that
    the appellant would not be rendered stateless.

40. We were provided with internet articles and  sections  from  Wikipedia.
    We were shown a ''Surrender Certificate of Indian Passport  dated  24th
    September 2014' and a copy of the passport of the appellant  which  the
    stamp across it 'Acquired British Foreign Nationality'.   The  evidence
    provided by the Secretary of State noted at Rule 23 of the  Citizenship
    Rules 2009 that 'Renunciation of Citizenship'  required  a  declaration
    under Section 8(1) [of the Citizenship Act 1955] which in turn included
    formalities.  There was no evidence of a declaration to that effect  in
    the bundle.  The evidence provided by the appellant at page  29  stated
    that

         '... any citizen of India who by  naturalisation,  registration  or
         otherwise voluntarily acquires, or has at any time between the 26th
         January 1950 and the commencement of this Act, voluntarily acquired
         the citizenship of another country shall, upon such acquisition or,
         as the case may be, such commencement, cease to  be  a  citizen  of
         India.

    There was no suggestion that the appellant had acquired his citizenship
    by 'voluntary means' or that he was an Indian citizen by anything other
    than 'descent'.  The evidence filed also noted that it  was  'generally
    difficult to have dual citizenship'.  It did not say it was impossible,
    (page 46 of the appellant's bundle).

41. In the Wikipedia article, however, there was  a  reference  to  Section
    9(1) of the Citizenship Act 1955 which states  that  'any  citizen'  of
    India who by naturalisation or registration acquires the citizenship of
    another country shall cease to be a citizen of India.

42. The evidence that was provided however, as we state, indicated that the
    applicant could indeed resume his citizenship.  The  Citizenship  Rules
    2009, which were provided by the Secretary of State, confirmed at  Rule
    24 that it was possible to resume Indian citizenship and  the  evidence
    provided by the appellant identified that the resumption of Citizenship
    by registration was provided for under Section 5 of the Citizenship Act
    1955 (as amended) as follows:

         'a person of Indian  origin  who  is  ordinarily  resident  in  any
         country or place outside undivided India'.

    There appeared to be no requirement for that person to reside in  India
    for any length of time. The applicant was a citizen of India  owing  to
    his birth not  by  acquisition  and  we  conclude  that  owing  to  the
    provisions for  the  resumption  of  citizenship  he  had  a  realistic
    prospect of the same even if an  official  order  needed  to  be  made.
    Nothing produced by the appellant indicated the  opposite;  rather  the
    reverse.

43. We conclude therefore that the evidence did not  demonstrate  that  the
    deprivation decision would make the appellant stateless or without  the
    option of resumption of Indian citizenship.

44. Although we are not required to make  a  proleptic  analysis,  and  the
    Court of Appeal decision in Aziz predates that of KV, it is now open to
    the appellant to make a human rights claim which must be considered  by
    the Secretary of State under the Immigration Rules, and which may  well
    involve the suitability provisions but any decision must comply with  R
    (Agyarko) [2017] UKSC 11 and it  is  for  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    consider whether there would be any unjustifiably harsh consequences on
    his removal.  Owing to the Secretary of State's Policy on Certification
    it is most unlikely that, as a family case with a British citizen wife,
    any refusal would be certified, and it is  open  to  the  appellant  to
    appeal.

45. There has been no decision to date to remove the appellant and there is
    a mechanism to examine whether there would  be  any  violation  of  his
    Article 8 rights.  The Secretary of State made clear  in  the  decision
    that there would be an intention to remove the appellant within 8 weeks
    of the deprivation order subject to  representations  being  made.   To
    date, however, those representations on human rights grounds  have  not
    been made to the respondent and we repeat it is not  for  us  pre-judge
    the outcome of any appeal or make an analysis based on  the  prediction
    of removal.  What the appellant would need to do is  to  make  a  human
    rights claim setting out the factors and appeal  any  refusal  of  that
    claim.

46. Crucially, as Mr Melvin indicated the appellant would be able to  raise
    the factors in relation to his British  citizen  wife,  his  length  of
    residence in the UK, and any medical grounds in any human rights claim.
    Those factors can be argued on the up to date evidence.  The  point  on
    statelessness would be one which would need to be argued, if necessary,
    with expert evidence. Mr Turner asserts any  claim  would  not  have  a
    prospect of success and thus the deprivation  should  not  be  enforced
    but, we repeat, on the basis of Aziz we are not required to undertake a
    'proleptic' (forecasting)  analysis.   There  has  been  no  notice  of
    removal yet served and accordingly, we  were  not  satisfied  that  the
    deprivation per se, despite his length of residence and his wife  being
    present in the United Kingdom, would violate the obligations of the  UK
    government under the Human Rights Act 1998.

47. The question is  whether  the  decision  is  proportionate.   There  is
    significant weight attached to the public interest as  set  out  at  BA
    which held

         'the tribunal will be required to place significant weight  on  the
         fact that the  Secretary  of  State  had  decided,  in  the  public
         interest, that a person who is  employed  deception  et  cetera  to
         obtain British citizenship should be deprived of that status".

48. The appellant has been found  to  have  deployed  deception  to  obtain
    British citizenship and there is a requirement  to  uphold  the  public
    confidence in the system.  We have considered the  circumstances  which
    included the appellant's length of residence in the United Kingdom  and
    his loss of benefits of  British  citizenship.   In  the  circumstances
    although we find the deprivation of citizenship  involves  interference
    with a right, that interference is no  greater  than  is  necessary  to
    achieve the legitimate aim of protecting and maintaining confidence  in
    the UK immigration system and the public  interest  in  preserving  the
    legitimacy of British nationality. The system  of  granting  leave  and
    naturalisation is significantly undermined by the use of deception.

49. Considering the evidence as we have done, including  the  arguments  on
    statelessness and in the absence  of  some  other  exceptional  feature
    which means the discretion under  Section  40(3)  should  be  exercised
    differently, we find that the exercise of discretion on deprivation was
    exercised correctly.  We conclude that the discretion of the  Secretary
    of State under section 40(3) of the British  Nationality  Act  1981  to
    deprive  the  appellant  of  his  British  citizenship  was   exercised
    correctly in the light of the evidence that  a  deprivation  order  may
    make him stateless but that he is in a position  to  re-acquire  Indian
    citizenship. No expert evidence was provided to the  contrary;  indeed,
    the evidence provided indicated that the appellant could resume  Indian
    citizenship without a residence requirement.

50. The appeal is dismissed.
