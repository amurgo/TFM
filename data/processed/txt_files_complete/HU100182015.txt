Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr C Howells, Counsel, instructed by N.C. Brothers &
                    Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nepal who applied for entry clearance  as
    the adult dependent son, of his father, a retired member of the Brigade
    of Gurkhas.  That application was made on 16 September 2015, and it was
    refused by the Entry Clearance Officer on 14  October  2015.   At  that
    date the Appellant was aged about 28ï¿½.  His  father  had  gained  entry
    clearance for the purposes of settlement in the  UK  in  2010  and  his
    mother and younger brother had travelled and settled in the UK in 2011.

 2. The Appellant's appeal against the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  came
    before Judge Abebrese sitting at Birmingham on 22  February  2017,  and
    the appeal was allowed on Article 8 grounds by decision promulgated  on
    9 March 2017.

 3. The Respondent applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    on two grounds and  permission  was  granted  on  them  by  First  tier
    Tribunal Judge Chamberlain by way of his decision of 6 September  2017.
    Those grounds complained that the  Judge  had  misdirected  himself  in
    relation to the proper approach to  the  question  of  whether  "family
    life" existed at any relevant date between the Appellant and the family
    members living  in  the  UK,  and,  to  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise. When the appeal was called  on  for  hearing,  Mr  Jarvis  on
    behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer abandoned the second ground.   We
    need say no more about that. So the matter comes before  us.   This  is
    the decision of us both.

 4. The appeal has therefore been pursued today  on  the  sole  basis  that
    Judge Abebrese's decision fails to make a  clear  finding  upon  a  key
    issue, namely whether there was in  existence  "family  life"  for  the
    purposes of Article 8 between  the  Appellant,  his  parents,  and  his
    younger brother at the date that they each left Nepal to settle in  the
    UK, or, latterly at the date that he applied for and was refused  entry
    clearance, or even more latterly, at the date of the hearing.

 5. Whilst this is a relatively brief decision, given the material that was
    under consideration, we are satisfied that neither the credibility  nor
    the substance of the evidence placed before the judge in the form of  a
    written witness statement from the Appellant made in February 2017  for
    the purposes of the appeal hearing, and a witness  statement  from  his
    father supplemented by his  oral  evidence,  was  the  subject  of  any
    material challenge.  The Entry Clearance Officer's position as advanced
    by his representative at the hearing was instead  to  seek  to  analyse
    that evidence by way of argument as to what, in law,  were  the  proper
    conclusions to be drawn from it, rather than to seek to challenge  that
    evidence as in any way untrue, or deserving of little weight.

 6. It is also clear to us, and indeed this  view  was  not  challenged  in
    argument before us, that Judge  Abebrese's  decision  does  demonstrate
    that he did have in mind the relevant jurisprudence; he refers to it in
    the course of his decision.  Thus he refers himself specifically to the
    guidance of the Court of Appeal to be found in Gurung & Ors [2013] EWCA
    Civ 8 and also to the guidance of the Upper Tribunal  to  be  found  in
    Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) Nepal [2012]  UKUT  160.
    Whilst he did not refer to the later decision of the Upper Tribunal  in
    Ghising & Ors (Ghurkhas: historic wrong; weight) [2013] UKUT 567  there
    is nothing in his decision to suggest that he did not have the relevant
    principles expressed therein, in mind. The Judge did not of course have
    the benefit of course of the decision of the Court of Appeal in  Rai  v
    Entry Clearance Officer, New Delhi [2017] EWCA  Civ  320  because  that
    decision was only promulgated on 28 April 2017.  Again, however,  there
    is nothing to be found within his decision to suggest that he  did  not
    have the relevant principles in mind.  The  decision  of  M  Jarvis  to
    abandon the second ground before us was undoubtedly  correct,  and  the
    proper approach.

 7. The focus before us today has been entirely on the question of  whether
    or not his decision demonstrates that Judge Abebrese made the requisite
    finding that family life existed at any  relevant  date,  or,  if  not,
    whether his findings of primary fact would allow us to go  on  to  make
    that finding for ourselves. Looking at his decision, we can see that he
    rehearsed in the course  of  his  findings  and  his  analysis  of  the
    evidence the Appellant's position in Nepal as an unemployed man who had
    completed his education in Nepal, and continued to live in  the  family
    home.  We can see that in paragraph 24 the  judge  takes  note  of  the
    following:

         "I do make a finding on the evidence before me that  the  Appellant
         who was aged 28 at the time of the application had not  and  indeed
         has still not at the date of  the  hearing  formed  an  independent
         family life of his own.  He is still very much  maintained  by  the
         sponsor  and  he  relies  on   them   for   his   maintenance   and
         accommodation.  He is single and he has not obtained employment  in
         Nepal.  I find the  evidence  credible  that  it  is  difficult  in
         respect of the obtaining of full-time gainful employment in  Nepal.
         The Appellant is now 29 years old, he has always lived at home with
         his parents as a student until they settled in the UK.  His  father
         in 2010 came to this country and his mother followed him  in  2011.
         I find on the facts that he has continued with his  studies  whilst
         residing in the family home in Nepal.  I do make a finding that the
         sponsor on the basis of advice provided to  him  did  not  make  an
         application for the Appellant to join the rest of the family in the
         United Kingdom.  I find that the decision of  the  Respondent  does
         acknowledge this to be credible and that previous versions  of  the
         policy did indeed prevent the Appellant from  joining  his  parents
         sooner.   It  would  therefore   in   my   view   be   unfair   and
         disproportionate  to  hold  the  fact  of  separation  against  the
         Appellant and his family and that on the basis of  the  documentary
         and oral evidence before me the sponsor has continued  to  maintain
         the Appellant financially during the period of separation."

 8. He went on in paragraph 25 to find that the documents placed before him
    to corroborate the oral evidence as to the sending of  money  to  Nepal
    for the support of the Appellant to be  credible  and  to  support  the
    sponsor's evidence in that respect. These passages follow  the  Judge's
    conclusion in paragraph 20 that "Article  8(1)  and  Article  8(2)  are
    indeed engaged in this instance".

 9. In our judgment it is quite clear when the decision is read as a whole,
    as the judge is entitled to have it read, that he did indeed find  that
    "family life" for the purposes of Article 8  existed  between  all  the
    members of the immediate family at the date that the Appellant's father
    left Nepal in 2010. It is also clear, to us at least,  that  the  judge
    accepted that that "family life" continued until the point at which the
    Appellant's mother and younger brother left Nepal in 2011. Again, it is
    clear to us, that the judge accepted that  the  only  reason  that  the
    Appellant did not apply for entry clearance  in  2011  along  with  his
    mother and younger sibling, was the advice the family had received that
    he did not qualify for it. Finally, it is clear to us, that  the  judge
    accepted  that  "family  life"  between  these  individuals   continued
    thereafter, up to, and including, the date of the hearing. Those  being
    the Judge's findings, in order for the Respondent to succeed, she would
    need to establish that the perversity test was made out. The grounds do
    not suggest that it is, and quite properly so.

10. That being our finding, it is accepted before us by Mr Jarvis that  the
    decision displays no material error of law, and that  the  decision  to
    allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds should indeed be confirmed.

Notice of decision


      The Decision of the First Tier Tribunal which  was  promulgated  on  9
      March 2017 did not involve the making  of  an  error  of  law  in  the
      decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds, that requires  that
      decision to be set aside and  remade.  That  decision  is  accordingly
      confirmed.
