For the Respondent:     Ms F. Allen, of Counsel

                                  DECISION

   1. It is common ground and agreed between  the  parties  that  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Majid made material errors of law in  determining  this
      appeal and that his decision to allow the appeal  cannot  be  defended
      and so must be set aside. It is also agreed between the  parties  that
      the inevitable consequence is that the appeal must be remitted to  the
      First-tier Tribunal to be determined afresh  by  a  judge  other  than
      Judge Majid.


   2. In the face of such consensus, it is necessary for me only  to  record
      that I have no doubt that the parties are correct and that  for  those
      reasons the determination of Judge Majid must be set aside.


   Summary of decision:
   3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Majid made errors of  law  material  to  the
      outcome of this appeal and his decision to allow  the  appeal  is  set
      aside.

   4. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed to  the  extent  that  the
      appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined  afresh
      by a judge other than Judge Majid.
