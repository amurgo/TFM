                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born in 1994.


    Anonymity Order

 2. This case concerns a claim for international protection, of a young man
    who arrived in this country as a minor; as a care leaver  he  continues
    to be classed as vulnerable.  Having had  regard  to  Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I  therefore  consider  it
    appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify the Appellant or  any  member
        of his family.  This direction applies to, amongst others, both the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. The Appellant's claim to international  protection  is  a  depressingly
    familiar one. He is from a village in Nangarhar province. This,  it  is
    accepted, is a part of Afghanistan where the Taliban have a significant
    presence, and where  recent  years  have  seen  a  marked  increase  in
    violence, both between government troops and the militants, and between
    competing  extremist  groups,  the  Taliban  and  'Islamic  State'   in
    particular.  The Appellant left because he feared being drawn into this
    violence. He claims that his father was a member  of  the  Taliban  who
    instructed the  Appellant's  older  brother  to  join  the  jihad.  The
    Appellant's brother did so  and  was  very  quickly  killed.  When  the
    Appellant's  father  intimated  that  it  was  his  intention  for  the
    Appellant  to  follow  his  brother  into  martyrdom,  other  relatives
    arranged for his departure from Afghanistan.  The Appellant fears  that
    his father will force him into the organisation. The Appellant  further
    fears detention and ill-treatment on  arrival  should  the  authorities
    come to know that he is from a family of two Taliban fighters.


 4. The First-tier Tribunal rejected the account. The  Appellant  had  been
    unable to provide a consistent chronology for  the  dates  of  the  key
    events  in  his   narrative,   and   his   evidence   was   vague   and
    unsubstantiated.   The Appellant had relied on a report by  Dr  Antonio
    Giustozzi which made clear that the Taliban do  not  in  fact  practice
    forced recruitment into their ranks. Whilst boys may  well  come  under
    substantial pressure from their families to do so,  in  this  case  the
    Appellant said that his father "never spoke to him about it" [at  �28].
    This  was  not  consistent  with  Dr  Giustozzi's  view  that  in   the
    patriarchal tribal structure of Afghan society, boys  are  expected  to
    follow - or in the  First-tier  Tribunal's  estimation  "indoctrinated"
    into following - their father's political alignment.   The  appeal  was
    thereby dismissed.

 5. On appeal  the  Appellant  has,  in  essence,  two  complaints.  It  is
    submitted that the First-tier Tribunal erred in the following respects:

          i) Failing to give the Appellant an  opportunity  to  respond  to
             points taken against him in  the  determination:  reliance  is
             placed on RR (challenging  evidence)  Sri  Lanka  [2010]  UKUT
             00274 (IAC);


         ii) Failing to take material evidence into account.

    Discussion and Findings


 6. There were matters that the Appellant frankly  admitted  he  could  not
    give detail about. He was unable to say, for instance,  if  his  father
    held any rank in the Taliban.  Nor  could  he  say  exactly  where  his
    father was during the periods that he was away from  the  family  home,
    nor give the exact date that his father had joined the  group.  In  his
    witness statement he explains that he did not  feel  able  to  ask  his
    father questions about such matters. His father was a "cruel  man"  and
    he was afraid of him. At  paragraph  28-29  of  the  determination  the
    Tribunal notes this lack of knowledge and finds that it  extends  to  a
    lack of knowledge about why the Appellant's father allegedly  supported
    the Taliban at all. Noting Dr Giustozzi's evidence that members of  the
    Taliban would expect their sons to adopt their ideology,  the  Tribunal
    finds the Appellant's lack of knowledge to be indicative of an  absence
    of indoctrination, this in turn indicating  that  his  father  was  not
    actually a Talib. See for instance �28: "it seems to  me  that  if  his
    father was an adherent to the ethos of the Taliban that  the  appellant
    would be in no doubt about it".


 7. Mr Moriarty submits this  reasoning  to  be  unfair  for  two  reasons.
    First, he submits, the evidence indicated that Appellant  had  in  fact
    been subject to such indoctrination. He had consistently said that  his
    father would "talk a lot" about  the  Taliban.  He  opposed  NATO,  the
    Americans and the western involvement in Afghanistan. He did  not  like
    the Afghan government because he did not consider them to  be  Islamic.
    He told the Appellant the history of the Taliban and how they had  come
    from the Mujahideen who had fought the  Russian  army  in  a  religious
    struggle. He told his son that life was better - more religious -  when
    the Taliban were in power because then everyone prayed  [see  interview
    record at Q35, witness statement at paragraph 7].  This was  consistent
    with the Appellant's evidence that prior to  joining  the  Taliban  his
    father had been an Imam at a madrassa.  Mr Moriarty submits  that  this
    evidence is hard to square with the finding at �28 that the Appellant's
    father had not "gone out of his way to indoctrinate his  son".  To  the
    contrary, the evidence supported the contention that he had.


 8. The second limb of Mr Moriarty's challenge in respect of these findings
    is that the  Appellant  was  not  put  on  notice  of  the  point.  The
    Respondent's refusal letter had queried why  he  could  not  give  more
    detail about his father's movements, but was silent on  the  matter  of
    ideology. The Appellant was asked at the hearing whether his father had
    spoken to him in the past about joining the  group;  he  had  confirmed
    that he had, and was asked no further questions. Had the  Tribunal  had
    any concerns about the Appellant's  alleged  lack  of  knowledge,  this
    should have been put to him. Had he been asked "what  did  your  father
    tell you about the Taliban's ideology", he  would  have  been  able  to
    answer the question.

 9. I am mindful that the Appellant's alleged lack of knowledge was not the
    only negative credibility finding made. It  is  apparent  however  that
    this was a central matter of concern for the Tribunal, consuming as  it
    does the whole of paragraphs 28 and 29. I am satisfied that this ground
    is made out.  The findings made are difficult  to  reconcile  with  the
    Appellant's evidence. Had there been concerns, these should  have  been
    put to him.


10. The same error is said to have occurred in respect of another  area  of
    the evidence. The Appellant had said that after his  brother  had  died
    his father had dispatched a letter to his wife  congratulating  her  on
    her son's martyrdom and instructing her to  prepare  the  Appellant  to
    follow his brother.  Unbeknownst to him, his  wife  had  died  after  a
    short illness and the Appellant had already been taken to live with  an
    uncle approximately two hours away. There was therefore a delay of some
    45 days before the letter came to be delivered  to  the  family,  by  a
    neighbour from their home village. In her refusal letter the Respondent
    had queried why a neighbour would go all that way  just  to  deliver  a
    letter.  This was a matter  addressed  in  the  Appellant's  subsequent
    witness statement:  he  had  explained  that  the  neighbour  had  been
    travelling to that place anyway and so had brought the letter with him.
    The determination rejects  the  entire  account  as  "little  short  of
    preposterous".  The Tribunal did not accept that the Appellant's father
    would have sent his wife such a letter when he knew that she  would  be
    opposed to the idea, and questioned how the  Appellant,  duly  prepared
    for battle, would be able to locate his  father's  group.  Mr  Moriarty
    submits that none of those matters were put to  the  Appellant  at  the
    hearing, and he cannot reasonably be expected to know that the Tribunal
    had those concerns, since they had not been raised by the Respondent.


11. Ms Ahmed submitted that this was a  species  of  finding  of  the  sort
    considered in Maheshwaran [2002] EWCA Civ 173.  The Appellant knew that
    this part of his account had been challenged and the Tribunal cannot be
    expected to deal with every nuance in the evidence at the hearing.  The
    Tribunal had weighed up the evidence and reached a  conclusion  on  it.
    Whilst the guidance given in Maheshwaran is  undoubtedly  wise  counsel
    for Tribunal judges,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  in  this  particular
    instance it is apposite.  This was not a case where the  appellant  had
    given obviously inconsistent statements. He did not,  as  Lord  Justice
    Schiemann puts it, manifestly have a forensic problem.   An  aspect  of
    the account had been questioned, and he had given  an  answer  to  that
    question. The matters raised in the determination at �30 were  entirely
    different points on plausibility.

12. The remaining grounds are concerned  with  the  approach  taken  to  Dr
    Giustozzi's report. In summary Dr Giustozzi had said that there were no
    known instances of press-ganging, but that young men were subjected  to
    more nuanced pressure  to  join  the  Taliban.  They  will  likely  for
    instance be subject to a societal expectation that they will follow the
    political alignment of their tribe, or their fathers. It  is  submitted
    that the Tribunal failed to appreciate that distinction. I would  agree
    with Ms Ahmed that this is not a fair reading of the determination. The
    Tribunal expressly recognises the evidence given  by  Dr  Giustozzi  on
    this point.   It was simply - for the reasons explored above - that the
    Tribunal had concluded that the Appellant had faced  no  such  pressure
    from his father.

13. Before me the parties were in agreement that the  credibility  findings
    made by the Tribunal  went  to  the  heart  of  the  decision.  If  the
    Appellant satisfied me that there were errors in approach to  the  fact
    finding, the appeal would need to be re-heard. I am satisfied that  the
    Tribunal did err in failing to give the  Appellant  an  opportunity  to
    respond to a forensic challenge, and further that it  appears  to  have
    overlooked  obviously  material  evidence.    It   follows   that   the
    determination must be set aside in its entirety.


      Decisions


14. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law and
    it is set aside.


15. The parties before me were in  agreement  that  due  to  the  extensive
    nature of the  fact-finding  required  in  this  appeal,  it  would  be
    appropriate if the matter was remitted to the First-tier Tribunal


16. There is an order for anonymity.
