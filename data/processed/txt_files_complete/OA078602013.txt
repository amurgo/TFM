                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
                         FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

Introduction

1.   The appellant applied for entry clearance as the  spouse  of  a  person
    present and settled in the UK on 14th December 2012.  That  application
    was refused by the ECO on 11th March 2013.  A review was carried out by
    the entry clearance manager (ECM) but he upheld the original  decision.
    The appellant, whom I will refer to as "Mrs Nisar", to avoid confusion,
    appealed to the First Tier Tribunal.  Judge of the First Tier  Tribunal
    Ferguson (the Immigration Judge) decided to allow her appeal, it seems,
    on the grounds that she qualified under the Immigration Rules.

Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

2.   The  present  appeal  is  by  the  respondent  before  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal, whom I will refer  to  as  "the  Secretary  of  State".   The
    Grounds of Appeal state that the First  Tier  Tribunal  erred  in  that
    Appendix FM and FM-SE contained a complete code for  the  determination
    of the evidence to be supplied to the ECO in support of an  application
    for entry clearance.   In particular, Mrs Nisar was  required  to  show
    that she had a gross annual salary  of  �18,600  and  this  had  to  be
    demonstrated in certain documents such as bank statements,  wage  slips
    and  so  forth.   She  had  not  satisfied  these   requirements   and,
    accordingly, the Immigration Judge ought to have dismissed  her  appeal
    to the First Tier Tribunal.   His decision  to  allow  the  appeal  was
    contrary to the law.  An alternative basis for attacking  the  decision
    of the First Tier Tribunal (that the Immigration Judge had  erroneously
    allowed the appeal under Article 8 of  the  ECHR)  was  not  maintained
    before the Upper Tribunal.  Both advocates accepted that Article 8  had
    not been considered by the Immigration Judge and, in so far as could be
    established, the only decision the Immigration Judge  made  related  to
    whether  or  not  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules   were
    fulfilled.

3.   Judge of First-tier Tribunal Ransley, who granted permission to  appeal
    to this Tribunal on 7th February 2014, identified a number of  arguable
    errors in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, specifically:

    (1)  There were only four payslips for the appellant's second employer,
         Azan Dawah, totalling �840. These were for the period between  July
         and October 2012. Additional payslips were provided at the  hearing
         for April 2013. Therefore, there was a gap between October 2012 and
         April  2013.    The  application  was  made   in   December   2012.
         Therefore, it appeared inaccurate  for  the  Immigration  Judge  to
         state (as he did at Paragraph 13 of his  Determination)  that  "All
         the requirements of Appendix FM-SC (sic) were met  in  relation  to
         the employment with Azan Dawah ..."   In fact, the sponsor  was  in
         Pakistan from November 2012 when he married the appellant  and  the
         entry clearance being made in December 2012.

    (2)  The combination of the P60 and payslips established that Mr Abbas,
         the sponsor, was earning �210 a month from his  second  employment.
          However, it was incorrect to say that these employments  took  the
         sponsor's earnings over the threshold of �18,600.   Clearly,  there
         was an issue as to whether or not the requirements of Appendix  FM-
         SE were met given that two months' payslips were missing  from  the
         requisite sequence even at the appeal stage.  Therefore, it was  at
         least  arguable  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         contained a material error of law.

The hearing

4.   Directions were sent out notifying the parties of  the  hearing  before
    the Upper Tribunal as well as standard directions to  the  effect  that
    evidence not before the First Tier Tribunal would not be considered  by
    the Upper Tribunal unless the latter had specifically decided to  admit
    such evidence.   No applications were made to admit fresh  evidence  by
    either party, although Mr Ahmed submitted that in the event I  found  a
    material error of law I should convene a fresh hearing for that  to  be
    considered.

5.   At  the  hearing  Mr  Ahmed  initially  indicated  that  he  no  longer
    maintained his application to adjourn the matter.  This is set  out  in
    Paragraph 1 of his Skeleton Argument handed to me at the hearing.    Mr
    Smart began by pointing  out  that,  although  the  Grounds  of  Appeal
    referred to the  decision  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  also  a
    decision under Article 8 of  the  ECHR,  in  fact  the  attack  on  the
    decision of the Tribunal below was directed to the decision  under  the
    Immigration Rules.   Indeed, both advocates agreed that the Immigration
    Judge appeared to have made no decision under Article 8;  at  least  no
    reasoned decision.

6.   Mr Smart submitted that Paragraph 9 of the  Determination  contained  a
    correct statement of the issue before the Tribunal, namely: whether the
    evidence satisfactorily  established  "in  a  manner  required  by  the
    Immigration Rules" that Mr Abbas earns above �18,600 per annum?   As to
    that issue, Mr Smart pointed to several ways in which the evidence fell
    short of that required by the  Immigration  Rules.    Specifically,  Mr
    Smart pointed to the following:

    (1)  The sponsor's Tesco payslips which had been submitted to  the  ECO
         did not include the month of June 2012.  Mr Smart  pointed  to  the
         requirements of Appendix FM, a copy of which he helpfully handed in
         to the Tribunal.   These included the financial requirements of the
         relevant sub-paragraphs of the Immigration Rules under Appendix FM.
         The  appellant  had  to  provide  evidence   that   the   necessary
         requirements were met for each permitted source  of  income  relied
         upon.   In the case of wage slips for salaried employment in the UK
         they had to cover a six month period  prior  to  the  date  of  the
         application under Paragraph 2(a)(i).  Accordingly, this requirement
         was not met.

    (2)  In relation to  the  sponsor's  employment  by  Azan  Dawah,  this
         employment had only begun  in  July  2012  and  therefore,  it  was
         accepted,  six  months'  wage  slips   could   not   be   supplied.
         Nevertheless, later in his submissions Mr Smart  pointed  out  that
         this situation is dealt with by Appendix FM, Paragraph 13(b)  which
         provides that where a person in salaried employment in the  UK  has
         been employed for less than six months their  gross  annual  income
         would be the total gross annual salary from employment  as  at  the
         date of the application.   I was also referred to Paragraph  15  of
         Appendix FM which requires the gross income for  the  twelve  month
         period prior to the application to  be  looked  at,  but  this,  he
         stated, still only came to �840. Mr  Smart  pointed  out  that  the
         sponsor still fell short of the requirements of  the  Appendix,  as
         calculated  by  the  ECO.   The  bank  statements  themselves  were
         unsatisfactory in that they did not cover the  required  six  month
         period stipulated by the Rules and specifically Appendix FM-SE.   I
         was referred to Paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE and in particular  to
         sub-paragraph (c) thereof.  That paragraph stipulated that personal
         bank statements had to correspond to the same period  as  the  wage
         slips relied on and show that the salary had  been  paid  into  the
         account in the name of the person  concerned  or  in  the  name  of
         another person and their partner.   A number of gaps  in  the  bank
         statements were pointed out.  These included the statement for  the
         period ended 29th June 2012 where there was no salary paid into the
         account, the statement dated 31st July 2012  which  showed  only  a
         salary from Tesco and the statement dated 31st  August  2012  which
         showed a salary of �168 from Azan  Dawah,  the  second  employment.
         There was no Tesco salary deposited on  the  statement  dated  28th
         September 2012.

7.   In the light of these gaps in the evidence I was  invited  to  conclude
    that the Immigration  Judge  was  wrong  to  conclude,  as  he  did  at
    Paragraph 13 of  his  determination,  that  "all  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE were met."   Clearly, a number of requirements were  not
    met; indeed, the Immigration Judge himself pointed to some deficiencies
    in the evidence at Paragraphs  10  -  11.    At  Paragraph  11  of  the
    Determination the Immigration Judge erroneously referred to  a  payment
    of �168 in July 2012 (this  was  in  fact  not  apparent  on  the  bank
    statement concerned).  Consequently, the Immigration Judge was wrong to
    allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

8.   In response, Mr Ahmed submitted that there were some documents  in  the
    ECO bundle which he did not accept were before the  Immigration  Judge.
    In other words, he did not accept the "gaps" in the evidence to be made
    out.

9.   Secondly, it was not accepted that issue  had  been  taken  before  the
    First Tier Tribunal with  the  sponsor's  Tesco  wages.   All  relevant
    evidence had been supplied at the date of the application, but if there
    were gaps or deficiencies it reflected the true state of  affairs,  for
    example, that the sponsor had not in fact been in  employment  for  any
    longer period than he had supplied wage slips for.

10.  Mr Ahmed appeared to submit at one  point  that  it  was  open  to  the
    Immigration Judge to consider evidence which post-dated the decision if
    it was pertinent to that decision.   However, I pointed out the  effect
    of Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

11.  It was pointed out again that the appellant had only been  employed  by
    Azan Dawah  since  July  2012  and  thus  could  not  comply  with  the
    requirements of the Rules.

12.  The Secretary of State  responded  by  referring  me  to  the  relevant
    provisions of Appendix FM-SE and specifically Paragraphs 13 -  15.   He
    said that the correct calculation had been carried out by the ECO.

13.  Mr Smart also submitted  that  there  was  no  reason  to  allow  fresh
    evidence to be adduced at this late stage.

14.  However, Mr Ahmed submitted that new evidence may need to be called  to
    deal with the suggestion that the Tesco wage slips were  incomplete  or
    did not justify the figures put forward by his client.

15.  At the end of the  hearing,  partly  on  time  grounds,  I  decided  to
    reserve the question of whether there had been a material error of  law
    in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Discussion

16.  Mr Ahmed suggested that the full bundle of  documents  before  the  ECO
    had not been provided to that Tribunal.   He raised this point in a fax
    to the Upper Tribunal on 10th April 2014. With respect, it is not clear
    why his client is unable to indicate  what  information  was  supplied.
    If there were additional documents before the ECO that  were not placed
    before the First-tier Tribunal there is no indication of  this  judging
    from the documents supplied to  this  Tribunal.   It  is  unclear  what
    documents Mr Ahmed now says were missing and how they  are  alleged  to
    have gone astray. But it was the appellant's responsibility  to  ensure
    that all documents supplied with the application were placed before the
    First-tier Tribunal.

17.  Mr Ahmed also suggested that the Tesco wages  had  not  been  in  issue
    before the Tribunal below, but the typewritten note of hearing prepared
    by the Immigration Judge suggest that both sources  of  income  to  the
    sponsor were referred to in the course of  evidence.   The  appellant's
    representative at that hearing, Mr Nawas Chatha,  accepted  that  there
    were gaps in the documentation supplied  by  his  client,  particularly
    relating to the sponsor's employment.   Unfortunately, these gaps  have
    not been satisfactorily explained or  filled.   The  onus  was  on  the
    appellant to show on the standard of a balance  of  probabilities  that
    she  satisfied  each   of   the   requirements   of   Appendix   FM-SE.
    Furthermore, following the commencement into force of  Section  85A  on
    23rd May 2011, the appellant was required to submit all her evidence at
    the time of making  her  application.   There  are  limited  exceptions
    arising out of the respondent's duty to act fairly, for example,  where
    a minor piece of information may easily be obtained.

18.  I accept the submissions made on behalf of the Secretary of State  that
    there were at least three gaps in the documentation  supplied.   First,
    there were the limited payslips for the employment at Azan  Dawah.  The
    total obtained from the Azan Dawah employment only came to  �840  which
    was well short of that required to make  the  total  up  to  the  total
    required by the Rules.  Given that that employment had  only  commenced
    in July 2012 it seems that it was encumbent on the  appellant  to  show
    that the gross income from salaried employment earned  by  the  sponsor
    was at least the equivalent of the gross annual salary from  employment
    required by the Immigration Rules  at  the  date  of  the  application.
    Clearly the appellant was unable to demonstrate this.  Secondly,  there
    was at least one Tesco payslip missing. More significantly,  the  total
    earned from working in Tesco combined with the  Azan  Dawah  employment
    equated to an annual income of �15,823.60.  It was inadequate  for  the
    purposes of Appendix FM.  Additionally, the  bank  statements  did  not
    verify the income from employment as they were  required  to  do  under
    Appendix FM, Paragraph 2(c).

19.  The Immigration Judge noted gaps in  the  documentation,  although  not
    all the gaps (see Paragraph 11).   He seems to have  had  regard  to  a
    P60, which post-dated the  decision  by  some  several  weeks,  as  the
    appellant's representative acknowledged.   It  was  incorrect  for  the
    Immigration Judge to state at Paragraph 13 of  his  determination  that
    "all the requirements" of the Appendix were met.   It  seems  that  the
    Immigration Judge was of the view that because an explanation was given
    for the failure to meet those requirements therefore the appellant  did
    not need to meet them.    With respect this  appears  to  misunderstand
    the Rules.

Conclusions

20.  Having carefully considered the decision of the  First  Tier  Tribunal,
    the Immigration Judge erred in his application  of  the  Rules  to  the
    facts.   The respondent has made out her principal  ground  of  appeal,
    namely that the specified evidence did not show  that  for  six  months
    prior to the date of the application the sponsor was in  receipt  of  a
    gross annual salary of at least �18,600.  It seems that,  as  Mr  Smart
    suggested, the Immigration Judge "adopted  his  own  approach"  to  get
    around the deficiencies in documentation.

Decision

The decision of the First Tier Tribunal contains a material error of law.  I
am satisfied that it is necessary to set aside that decision.

I substitute decision my decision which  is  that  the  appeal  against  the
decision of the ECO should be dismissed.

No anonymity direction was made pursuant to Rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

FEE AWARD

In the light of my decision I have decided to make no fee award.
