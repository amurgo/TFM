Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Snape made following a hearing at Birmingham on 29th July 2014.





Background

 2. The first claimant is a citizen of Zimbabwe born on 26th  August  1962.
    The second is his wife and the third and fourth are their children.

 3. The first claimant came to the UK  in  September  1979  as  a  student,
    leaving in September 1984 to return  to  Zimbabwe,  where  he  remained
    until 1990.  He  then  lived  with  his  wife  in  the  United  States,
    obtaining  an  MBA  from  the  University  of  Pennsylvania,  and   was
    subsequently employed by an American bank before being  transferred  to
    London.  He stayed in the UK between 1992 and 1998 when he returned  to
    Zimbabwe.  The family lived there between  October  1998  and  December
    2000 when they  moved  to  Johannesburg  in  South  Africa  where  they
    remained until December 2006.

 4. The claimant came to the UK as a highly skilled migrant on 4th November
    2007  accompanied  by  the  second  claimant.   The  third  and  fourth
    claimants had arrived in the UK  earlier,  on  8th  September  2006  on
    student visas.

 5. The visas were renewed until 25th November 2012.  On 24th November 2012
    they applied for indefinite leave to remain  but  the  application  was
    rejected for insufficient funds.  On 22nd December 2012 they  gave  the
    required fees to their lawyer but the applications  were  not  in  fact
    submitted until 14th January 2014.  They were refused on 19th  February
    2014 without a right of appeal.  An appeal was nevertheless  lodged  on
    6th March 2014.  It was argued that the claimants did have a  right  of
    appeal because in substance the application was self-evidently a  human
    rights application at the  initial  stage  because  it  included  three
    dependants two of whom were minors in full-time education in the UK  (R
    Jirshe) v SSHD [2010] EWHC 2043).

The Judge's Determination

 6. The judge recorded that no consideration was given  to  the  claimants'
    rights under paragraph EX of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    because they had not made an application and  paid  the  required  fee.
    However the respondent considered whether it would  be  appropriate  to
    allow the family to remain in the UK outside the Immigration Rules.

 7. The judge set out the law.   She  said  that  it  was  clear  that  the
    children were both gifted young men, able and  willing  to  participate
    fully in the educational system and it was highly  unlikely  that  they
    would be able to be educated to  a  similar  level,  were  they  to  be
    returned to Zimbabwe.  They had lived in the UK for most of their lives
    and were  well-integrated  into  UK  society.   The  first  and  second
    claimants were highly skilled and would in all likelihood  be  able  to
    obtain employment in the UK.

 8. She noted that the third and fourth claimants  had  spent  very  little
    time in Zimbabwe.  The elder had been there for two years whilst a very
    young child and the younger child had only lived there for a couple  of
    months.  Both had been in the UK for just short of eight  years.   They
    were funded by one of the most prestigious public schools  in  the  UK,
    Eton, and it was clear that both boys were extremely talented.

 9. The first claimant was highly skilled and  had  considerable  expertise
    and the second was a lawyer who wanted to continue her legal  practice.
    They should have been able to qualify in 2012 for indefinite  leave  to
    remain but were unable to do so because of a debt of ï¿½34,000 owed by  a
    former client.

10. She concluded as follows:

         "I do not consider that the  interests  of  the  third  and  fourth
         appellants would be safeguarded and protected by obliging  them  to
         leave the UK to face an uncertain educational future  in  Zimbabwe.
         Given the degree of their integration in UK society and the  length
         of time that they have resided in this country with their parents I
         do not find that the  removal  decision  is  proportionate  to  the
         legitimate public end sought to be achieved namely the  maintenance
         of immigration control and on that basis the appeals are allowed."

The Grounds of Application

11. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had erred in law by failing to have regard  to  the  relevant
    requirements in the Immigration Rules as a  relevant  consideration  in
    the assessment of proportionality.  The requirements of the Rules  were
    a relevant consideration and a factor to be accorded great weight.

12. Second, in assessing the family's case with reference to the children's
    interests, the judge had erred in  failing  to  consider  the  test  in
    paragraph 276ADE(iv) of the Rules which would  allow  the  children  to
    remain on the basis of private life only if they are under the  age  of
    18 years, had lived continuously in the UK for at least seven years and
    it would not be reasonable to expect the applicants to  leave  the  UK.
    That test captures the essential elements in any Article  8  assessment
    absent compelling features not recognised in the Rules  of  which  none
    were identified.  Had the test been considered in the  context  of  the
    parents'  immigration  position  and   general   public   interest   in
    immigration control, the judge would have found it reasonable  for  the
    children to leave the UK.

13. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Nightingale on  17th  October
    2014.  Judge Nightingale stated that it was arguable that the judge had
    erred in failing to consider in the first instance the requirements  of
    Appendix FM and/or paragraph 276ADE  with  regard  to  Article  8.   He
    observed that it might be that the outcome would have been the same  in
    view of the findings of fact made which  were  not  challenged  in  the
    grounds pleaded and the lack of any adverse immigration history.

Submissions

14. Mr Diwnycz relied on his grounds.  Although invited to do so,  he  said
    that he was not seeking to enlarge them.

15. Mr Pipe acknowledged that there was some merit in the grounds but  that
    even if there had been an error in law it would have made no difference
    to the decision.

Findings and Conclusions

16. The  first  issue  before  the  judge  relates  to  jurisdiction.   The
    application made by the first claimant was after his leave had  expired
    and the refusal of that application does  not  therefore  in  principle
    carry a right of appeal.  Removal decisions were made against all  four
    claimants on 19th February 2014.   The  Secretary  of  State's  initial
    position was that the  decisions  attracted  only  an  out  of  country
    appeal.

17. The matter came before Judge Law at Arnhem House in Leicester  on  24th
    March 2014.  He said that the  appeal  relies,  inter  alia,  on  human
    rights grounds which were referred to  in  the  Notice  of  Appeal.   R
    (Jishe) v SSHD [2010] EWHC 2043 (Admin)  and  Anwar  and  Adjo  v  SSHD
    [2010] EWCA Civ 1275 suggested that incorporating a human rights  claim
    may satisfy the definition of claims with the IAC to be regarded  as  a
    designated place for claims to be lodged.  He directed that the  appeal
    should proceed before an Immigration Judge so  that  the  Secretary  of
    State could pursue any validity  arguments  before  the  judge  at  the
    hearing.

18. The Presenting Officer at the hearing before Judge Snape did not  argue
    that there was no in-country right of appeal.  It seems  to  have  been
    agreed between the parties at the hearing, and  not  challenged  since,
    that this  appeal  falls  within  Section  92(4)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on the basis that the claimant has made
    a human rights claim and therefore,  under  Section  92(1)  may  appeal
    against the removal decision whilst he is in the UK.

19.  The  reasons  for  refusal  letter,  unsurprisingly,  deals  with  the
    application which was made by the first claimant for  indefinite  leave
    to remain following leave as a Tier 1 Migrant.  The Secretary of  State
    specifically  excluded  from  her  considerations  paragraph  EX.1   of
    Appendix FM because no specified application on the basis of family and
    private life had been made.  In  effect  the  judge  adopted  the  same
    approach as the Secretary of State and did not address the Rules.

20. The provisions of Appendix FM could not assist the  claimant  since  no
    application on the  basis  of  the  partner  or  parental  route  could
    succeed.  To that extent the grounds are arguably correct and the judge
    should have taken as her starting point the fact  that  the  appellants
    cannot succeed within Appendix FM.

21. However, the more relevant Rule is that set out in paragraph  276AD(iv)
    which would allow the third and fourth claimants leave to remain on the
    basis of private life if they

         "are under the age of 18 years and have lived continuously  in  the
         UK  for  at  least  seven  years  (discounting   any   periods   of
         imprisonment)  and  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
         applicants to leave the UK."

22. In this case the children have lived in the UK for  over  seven  years.
    Both have been here for just short of eight years.

23. The question therefore is whether the judge addressed  herself  to  the
    question of whether it would be reasonable to expect them to leave  the
    UK.

24. The judge recorded as follows:

         "The third and fourth appellants have spent over seven years living
         in the  UK  and  have  successfully  obtained  scholarships  to  an
         extremely prestigious school.  It is clear  they  are  engaged  not
         only in school activities but also in sporting activities and  with
         the local community in religious observance.

         I have seen letters written by both boys at pages 17 and 18 of  the
         Appellants' bundle of evidence and it is clear that they are gifted
         young men who are able and willing  to  participate  fully  in  the
         educational system.  It is highly unlikely that they would be  able
         to be educated to a similar level were they to be obliged to return
         to Zimbabwe.  In their letters they say they have had  very  little
         contact with Zimbabwe and on that basis  it  is  clear  that  their
         education would be prejudiced."

25. As at the date of hearing the boys were 14 and 16 years  old  and  both
    were about to embark on A level and GCSE courses at Eton College.

26. It is quite clear that the judge had at the forefront of her  mind  the
    question of reasonableness of return, even though there is no  specific
    reference to paragraph 276ADE.  She recorded  that  both  had  obtained
    scholarships to Eton College and were at  a  critical  stage  of  their
    education.  She also took into account the fact that neither had  spent
    any significant time in Zimbabwe.  The older child had lived there  for
    two years between 1998 and 2000 when he  was  a  baby/toddler  and  the
    younger had only been there for a few months as a baby.

27. Judge Nightingale was correct in the grant  of  permission  to  observe
    that, even if the judge had cited the relevant Rule,  the  outcome  was
    likely to have been the same.

28. This case was heard the day after Section 117 of the 2014 Act came into
    force.  The judge recorded that she was required to consider the public
    interest question and the factors set out in Section 117.

29. Section 117B states as follows:

         "(1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
             public interest.

         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English -

             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic wellbeing  of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons -

             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to -

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that  is
                  established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in
                  the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
             a person at a time when the  person's  immigration  status  is
             precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where -

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom."

30. The judge accepted that the claimants  had  an  impeccable  immigration
    history and that the first and second claimants were highly skilled and
    would in all likelihood  be  able  to  obtain  employment  in  the  UK.
    However, she did  not  address  herself  to  the  question  of  Section
    117B(5), namely that little weight should be given to  a  private  life
    established by a person at a time when the person's immigration  status
    is precarious.

31. No reference to any error of law is made in the grounds in relation  to
    Section 117B.  Mr Diwnycz was invited to state  whether  he  wished  to
    apply to enlarge his grounds and he specifically stated that he did not
    wish to do so in relation to 117B(5).

32. It is not for me to make the Secretary  of  State's  case.   I  am  not
    prepared to find an error of law in a decision where  no  challenge  is
    made by the Secretary of State either in the grounds or at the  hearing
    on the issue of whether the judge erred  in  law  in  relation  to  her
    consideration of precariousness.

33. Finally, with respect to EV (Philippines), cited in the grounds,  there
    is no inconsistency between this decision and  that  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in this case.  At paragraph 58 Lord Justice Lewison stated:

         "In my judgment therefore the assessment of the best  interests  of
         the children must be made on the basis that the facts are  as  they
         are in the real world.  If one parent has no right  to  remain  but
         the other parent does that is  the  background  against  which  the
         assessment is conducted.  If neither parent has the right to remain
         then that  is  the  background  against  which  the  assessment  is
         conducted.  Thus the ultimate question will be: is it reasonable to
         expect the child to follow the parent with no right  to  remain  to
         the country of origin?"

34. The judge did address herself to that question.  These two children are
    enjoying opportunities in the UK which simply could not be  matched  in
    Zimbabwe.   They  are  at  a  particularly  critical  stage  of   their
    education.  The loss to them of removal at this time would be huge.  It
    would of course have been open to the Secretary of State to argue  that
    the children could remain boarding at Eton and their parents  could  be
    removed, but that is not her position  since  she  has  issued  removal
    decisions against all of the members of the family.

Decision

35. The original judge did not err  in  law.   Her  decision  stands.   The
    Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
