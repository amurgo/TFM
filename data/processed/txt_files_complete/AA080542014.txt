                                   Before

                    MR C. M. G. OCKELTON, VICE PRESIDENT

                                   Between

                                  WAQAR [A]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REMITTAL


 1. The determination of this appeal has been set aside  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal: [2019] EWCA Civ 302.  It is apparent from paragraph  [63]  that
    the Court envisaged remittal to the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. In the light of that  indication  I  wrote  to  the  parties  proposing
    remittal without more  ado.   There  has  been  no  response  from  the
    Secretary of State; the appellant agrees  with  the  course  of  action
    proposed.

 3. Following the decision of the Court of Appeal I set aside the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal in this case.  I remit  the  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for redetermination.




                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
