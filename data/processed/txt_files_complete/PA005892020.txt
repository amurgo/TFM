                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq born  in  1994.   He  appeals  with
    permission against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Shimmin) to dismiss his appeal on protection and human rights grounds.

 2. The basis of the Appellant's claim before the First-tier  Tribunal  was
    that he faces a real risk of 'honour' based violence in his  home  area
    of Iraq. He claimed to have had a relationship with a married woman (Z)
    whose family discovered the affair. They raided the Appellant's  family
    home and have declared an intention to kill him.

 3. The Tribunal did not believe any of that. In its decision of  the  17th
    March  2020  the  Tribunal  gave  several  reasons  for  rejecting  the
    Appellant's account. This  appeal  is  concerned  with  some  of  those
    findings, and whether the Tribunal erred in law in  reaching  them.   I
    note at the outset that at its �33 the Tribunal said this:

         "Whilst individually any one of these credibility points might not,
         on its own, persuade  me  that  the  appellant  was  an  incredible
         witness, when I consider the various points here and in the reasons
         for refusal letter cumulatively, I come to the conclusion that  the
         appellant was not credible".

    As a result of this self-direction the Secretary of State has before me
    been compelled to concede that if any of the grounds are made out, then
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be set  aside,  no  matter
    how cogent the remaining reasons for dismissing this claim  might  have
    been.

 4. In  reaching  my  decision  I  have  taken  into  account  the  written
    submissions of Senior Presenting Officer  Mr  Bates,  and  the  written
    submissions of Ms Khan of Counsel, the grounds prepared by Ms Bashow of
    Counsel and the oral submissions.

    Discussion and Findings

 5. The first ground is that the Tribunal failed to take  material  matters
    into account when it applied section 8  of  the  Asylum  (Treatment  of
    Claimants etc) Act 2004 to the Appellant's case. The Tribunal had found
    that the  Appellant  had  failed  to  avail  himself  of  a  reasonable
    opportunity to claim asylum in Italy or France en route to  the  United
    Kingdom; it found it to be reasonably likely  that the agents that  the
    Appellant had engaged would be "very willing to take less risk and have
    less expense by depositing the appellant in one of these safe countries
    rather than going through another difficult border".   In  her  grounds
    Counsel submits that the Tribunal has failed to take into  account  the
    well-established facts that agents place their  charges  under  duress,
    and that they make more money in getting people to the United  Kingdom:
    see for instance R (on the application of Q and  Ors)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA  Civ  364  [at  �40]  and  AA
    (unattended children) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00016 (IAC) [at �115].

 6. I fully accept that many  thousands  of  migrants  who  are  trafficked
    across the borders of Europe are at the mercy of  the  criminal  agents
    who facilitate this trade. The evidence presented in both of the  cases
    referred to by Counsel in her well researched grounds was that migrants
    can in such situations be subject to  pressure,  threats  and  in  some
    cases violence. I agree that it was unduly speculative for the Tribunal
    to opine that it would be easier  for  the  smugglers  to  leave  their
    'customers' in Italy  or  France  -  there  may  be  many  reasons,  in
    individual cases, why they would not do so. I am not however  satisfied
    that this assists the Appellant. The Appellant is a grown  man  who  is
    fit and well. He was twice fingerprinted by  the  authorities  in  safe
    third countries: on the 25th June  2017  in  Italy  and  in  France  on
    approximately the 20th July 2017.  He has nowhere suggested that he was
    inhibited from claiming at these points by any kind of intimidation. It
    follows that he did fail to avail himself of a  reasonable  opportunity
    to seek protection and the Judge was fully entitled to apply s8 AI(TC)A
    2004 in those circumstances.

 7. The second ground is that the Tribunal misunderstood, or made  mistakes
    of fact, as to the evidence. At its �31 the Tribunal found that if  the
    Appellant cared for Z, he would have taken her with him with  he  fled.
    In fact the evidence, in both the asylum interview and at the  hearing,
    was that the Appellant had tried to take Z with him: he had  pulled  at
    her hand and tried to get her to come but she was in state of shock and
    couldn't move.

 8. I am not satisfied that any  error  of  fact  or  misunderstanding  has
    arisen. It is apparent from the face of the decision  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal knew what the evidence was: it is set  out  at  �30.  The
    point is that the Tribunal rejected  that  evidence  as  not  credible:
    "Both he and [Z] would be well aware of the fatal consequences that [Z]
    would face. If he cared for her, and she for him, he would  have  taken
    her with him".  Whilst Ms Khan wisely reframed this ground as a failure
    to engage with the Appellant's evidence rather than an error of fact, I
    do not find ground two to be made out.  The  point  that  the  Tribunal
    makes is that the Appellant would not - where his lover  is  facing  an
    'honour' killing - have simply left her because she was in shock.  That
    was a finding open to it on the evidence.

 9. Third, the Tribunal is said to  have  erred  in  its  approach  to  the
    identity of Z's  father.   At  its  �26  the  Tribunal  concludes  "the
    appellant was not able to  give  any  relevant  information  about  her
    father's position as a high ranking official". As a matter of fact,  it
    was wrong to say that the Appellant had provided no information at all:
    he had at his asylum interview provided  details  when  asked.  He  had
    given the man's full name, identified the district where he works, said
    where the PUK offices are there  and  explained  his  role  within  the
    organisation.   The question posed was whether any of that was, as  the
    First-tier Tribunal put it, "relevant".  It is hard to  know  what  the
    Tribunal  meant  here.  All  of  that  was  plainly  relevant  to   the
    Appellant's claim that this man exists, and is a PUK  official  in  his
    neighbourhood of Darbandikhan.  It may, as Mr Bates  points  out,  have
    fallen short of establishing that  he  was  regarded  in  the  locality
    as"famous and wealthy" but it is hard to say that it was  not  relevant
    to the Appellant's claim, which presumably rested on the connection  to
    the PUK rather than how well known he was.  I am  satisfied  that  this
    ground is made out.  I should add that the  reasoning  on  this  matter
    contains a further error: at �27 the Tribunal properly  directs  itself
    that it is legally impermissible to  require  corroboration  in  asylum
    claims, before going on to draw adverse  inference  from  the  lack  of
    corroborative evidence.   It is one thing for a  lack  of  evidence  to
    mean that a claimant cannot  discharge  the  burden  of  proof:  it  is
    another to hold, as here, that his "credibility is damaged" because  of
    a failure to do so.

10. Finally, the Appellant submits that the Tribunal applied too  high  and
    standard of proof/acted irrationally in requiring  him  to  provide  an
    exact timeline. The Tribunal held at its �23  that  the  Appellant  had
    failed to provide a "reasonable and credible" timeline of when  he  met
    Z, how often they met, and  when  he  proposed  marriage  to  her.   It
    rejected, without reasons, the Appellant's explanation that  he  cannot
    remember the dates with any  greater  precision.  The  very  well-drawn
    grounds point to scientific research, the Appellant's own evidence  and
    caselaw to submit that it is unrealistic to  expect  applicants  to  be
    able to give the precise dates and times for events in their lives. The
    Appellant himself had never claimed to have a  precise  recall  of  the
    dates. He had explained at his asylum interview that the dates  he  was
    giving  were  approximations.  This,  it  is  submitted,  is   entirely
    consistent with what is known about the limits and variations in  human
    memory. The interview took place in October 2019, the hearing in  March
    2020, and the Appellant was being asked to give the  dates  for  events
    that took place in March 2016.

11. I am satisfied that this ground is made out. The weight to be  attached
    to evidence such as dates  should  always  be  assessed  with  caution,
    particularly where, as here, the  events  narrated  allegedly  happened
    some time ago and there were no particular  events  to  act  as  'pegs'
    pinning down the memory - the evidence did not for instance  concern  a
    particular demonstration  or  anniversary.  Rather  the  Appellant  was
    recounting informal encounters between him and a customer in  his  shop
    spread over a period of some months. Absent any particular  reason  for
    him to have committed to memory the dates that Z appeared in his  shop,
    it is difficult  to  see  why  his  evidence  was  not  "reasonable  or
    credible".

    Conclusion

12. There are, as identified in the  Respondent's  refusal  letter  and  Mr
    Bates' submissions, significant credibility problems for the Appellant.
    It remains the case however that his evidence must be assessed  on  the
    lower standard of proof in a manner compatible with  the  jurisprudence
    on asylum claims. Had the  Tribunal  said  nothing  at  all  about  the
    chronology, or Z's father, this is a decision that would have survived.
    But the errors having been established, it follows from the  Tribunal's
    paragraph 33 that it now falls to be remade by a judge other than Judge
    Shimmin.




    Decisions

13. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains material error of
    law and it is set aside.

14. The decision is to be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.

15. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"
