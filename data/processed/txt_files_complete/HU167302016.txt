Representation:

For the Appellant:                  Mr A Rahman (Legal Representative, JKR
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:               Ms A Everett (Home Office Presenting
Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh, he entered the UK on the 25th
   of February 2006 as a student with leave to remain until the end of May
   2009. There were a number of extensions of leave to the 9th of May 2015.
   On the 8th of May 2015 a further application was made but refused with no
   in-country right of appeal, an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was
   rejected for want of jurisdiction and was followed by judicial review
   proceedings which were unsuccessful, notification of the refusal being
   given on the 1st of February 2016. On the 8th of February 2016 made the
   application forming the basis of these proceedings. That application was
   refused but with an in-country right of appeal which the Appellant
   exercised.

2. The Appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Gillespie
   at Taylor House on the 8th of December 2017. The Appellant's appeal was
   dismissed for the reasons given in the decision promulgated on the 5th of
   January 2017. It was common ground that the Appellant could not show that
   he had 10 continuous lawful residence in the UK, the Home Office accepted
   in the Refusal Letter that the Appellant had been without leave since the
   24th of September 2015. The Home Office took the time without leave to
   the date of the application, the 8th of February 2016, making the total
   time without leave as 137 days.

3. In the decision at paragraph 30 the Judge calculated the time without
   leave as running from the 9th of May 2015 to the 8th of February 2016 and
   stated that came to "a full eight months and 46 days short of the 10-year
   qualifying period." That was followed by an assessment of the Appellant's
   private life in the course of which the Judge found that the Appellant's
   removal would be proportionate. There is clearly a typing error in the
   number of days which perhaps should have read "16 days". For this
   decision that is neither here nor there.

4. The grounds argue that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in respect of
   the nature of the Appellant's presence, it was argued that the Judge was
   wrong to characterise it as precarious when that term was understood to
   mean unlawful. It is also argued that the Judge erred in respect of the
   length of the gap in the Appellant's lawful residence in the UK, the date
   should have been take from the 24th of September as stated by the
   Secretary of State. Consequent upon that it was argued that the Judge had
   not properly considered how nearly the Appellant had missed the 10 year
   period when assessing proportionality and had not considered the
   Appellant's explanation for the gap and its length.


5. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth on the
   22nd of February 2018. It was arguable that the period that the Appellant
   was without leave was less than that indicated by the Judge. It was
   arguable that an exact calculation should have been set out. Consequently
   it was arguable that the arguments regarding exceptionality could be
   viewed as having received less weight. There was no rules 24 response
   from the Secretary of State.


6. The submissions are set out in the Record of Proceedings and are
   referred to where relevant below. The Home Office indicated that the
   Judge might well have been correct in the analysis of the length of the
   gap in the Appellant's residence but conceded that in the Refusal Letter
   the period of 137 days was the time given in any event the Home Office
   maintained that the decision was proportionate even on the shorter
   period. I asked of Mr Rahman given that the rules could not be met what
   compelling circumstances existed to justify a grant of leave under
   article 8, he replied that taking into account the public interest the
   proportionality exercise would go in the Appellant's favour.


7. The Appellant's explanation for the gap and the applications he made was
   based on the advice he received from the solicitors he had at the time.
   The Appellant was represented but it was only at the hearing that this
   was raised, given that this was a point that was in issue and relevant it
   is not clear why it had not been addressed before. There was nothing from
   the Appellant's then representatives before the Judge to explain. Even if
   the Appellant had made a further application it is speculative as to the
   consideration that it would have received at that time.


8. As it stood the Appellant sought to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in
   an application that was bound to fail and did so being rejected for want
   of jurisdiction. The application for judicial review was a justified
   mechanism for challenge but in the event did not assist the Appellant.


9. In my view the length of the gap that the Home Office had accepted in
   the Refusal Letter was the one to be applied to the Appellant's
   circumstances is not materially different from the longer period
   calculated by the Judge. 4� months compared to 8 to 9 months of the
   Judge's decision is not particularly significant. The judge was
   considering a private life claim which attracts less significance than a
   family life claim and the observations in the cases referred to in
   paragraph 31 are relevant. The point was reinforced by Patel and Others v
   Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 72 which the Judge
   did not refer to but would have been pertinent.


10. In paragraphs 33 and 34 the Judge discussed the Appellant's
   circumstances and the statutory regime that applied. The Judge has to be
   taken to have found that there were nothing compelling about the
   Appellant's circumstances that would justify a grant of leave outside the
   rules and there was nothing in the evidence that Mr Rahman could point to
   that would have led to a different conclusion. As the Judge observed in
   paragraph 33 his private life was of a fairly ordinary character and he
   retained links to Bangladesh. In the circumstances while it can be argued
   that the Judge considered a longer period than had been agreed by the
   Secretary of State that period, at 4� months, was in the context of an
   unexceptional private life not material. The Judge was entitled to
   dismiss the appeal for the reasons given and the decision contains no
   error of law.


11. As a foot note I would add that the claim that the term precarious
   would have to mean illegal has no merit. The case of AM (S 117B) Malawi
   [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) clearly drew the distinction between a person whose
   presence depended on grants of leave being precarious and those without
   leave being in the UK illegally.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

Fee Award

In dismissing this appeal I make no fee award.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
