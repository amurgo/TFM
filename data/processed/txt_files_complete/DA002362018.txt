For the Respondent:    Mr R Spurling, instructed by Clapham Law LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  against
the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing  Mr  Ratnasingham's  appeal
against a decision to  deport  him  from  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to
regulation 23(6)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
2016 ("the EEA Regulations").

For the purposes of  this  decision,  we  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
Secretary of State as the respondent and Mr Ratnasingham as  the  appellant,
reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the  First-tier
Tribunal.

The appellant is a citizen of France, originally from Sri Lanka, born on  29
April 1961. He claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom in  1997.  On  6
July 2006, and again on 11 August 2010, he was issued  with  a  registration
certificate. On 9 August 2016 he was convicted  at  Harrow  Crown  Court  of
fraud by abuse of position and on 21 September  2016  he  was  sentenced  to
three years' imprisonment and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of �120.  On
16 November 2016 he was served with a liability for deportation  notice  and
on 18 September 2017 the respondent made a  decision  to  deport  him  under
regulation 27 of the EEA Regulations.

In the deportation decision,  the  respondent  accepted  that  the  evidence
produced by the appellant of his employment in  the  UK  was  sufficient  to
demonstrate that he had acquired the right to permanent residence.  However,
owing to large gaps in the evidence from 2004 to 2008 and 2014 to 2015,  the
respondent did not accept that the appellant had been continuously  resident
in the UK for 10 years in accordance with the EEA  Regulations.  Accordingly
consideration was given to whether his deportation was justified on  serious
grounds of public policy. The respondent noted  that  the  circumstances  of
the appellant's offence was that over a period of 17 months  he  had  abused
his position of trust by defrauding his employer of a sum  of  approximately
�58,000. The respondent considered there to be  insufficient  evidence  that
the appellant had addressed his offending behaviour, that there  remained  a
risk of him re-offending and that he continued to pose a  risk  of  harm  to
the public. The respondent considered that the appellant  posed  a  genuine,
present and sufficiently serious threat to the interests  of  public  policy
and that it would not be unduly harsh to expect him  to  return  to  France.
The respondent considered there to be a lack of evidence to  show  that  the
appellant had  a  subsisting  relationship  with  his  wife  and  two  adult
children in the UK. It was  considered  that  the  decision  to  deport  the
appellant was  proportionate  and  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of
regulation 27(5) and (6) of the  EEA  Regulations  and,  further,  that  his
deportation would not breach his Article 8 rights under the ECHR.

The appellant appealed against that decision and his  appeal  was  heard  in
the First-tier Tribunal on 10 May 2018 by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M  A
Khan. The appellant appeared without a legal representative. He  produced  a
witness statement for his appeal, in which he set out his circumstances.  He
explained in his statement that he had arrived in the UK in  1997  with  his
wife and two children and was given a ten year  residency  card  on  arrival
which was renewed in 2007. His children were  currently  at  university  and
working part-time and his wife worked. He had been living in the UK  for  21
years and had bought a house here. He had worked since shortly after  coming
to the UK, at a food factory for seven years and then as a shop  worker  for
11 years. He had always been in full-time  employment  in  the  UK  and  had
never been in receipt of benefits. He had always been a law-abiding  citizen
until he committed the offence which was stupid and out  of  character.  His
wife was not working at the time and he was struggling to pay the bills  and
to pay his mother's medical expenses in Sri Lanka. His mother was  dying  at
the time and had since passed away. He  had  completed  several  courses  in
prison and had shown genuine remorse for his  actions.  He  had  no  one  in
France and did not want to go back there.

The appellant adopted his statement as his evidence and  gave  further  oral
evidence before the Tribunal, explaining that he had sent  the  money  which
he had defrauded from his employer to  his  mother  in  Sri  Lanka.  He  was
currently separated from his wife and was living with a friend  in  a  flat.
His sons  were  at  university.  The  submissions  made  on  behalf  of  the
respondent accepted that the appellant had  established  that  he  had  been
living in the UK for five years but  not  for  10  years,  although  it  was
accepted that he had been issued registration documents on two occasions.

Judge Khan noted that the appellant was unable to demonstrate his  10  years
of residence in the UK by way  of  documentary  evidence  and  accepted  the
appellant's explanation that his passport and registration certificates  had
been  taken  by  the  police  when  he  was  arrested.  He  noted  that  the
respondent's own records showed that the appellant had been in  the  UK  for
more than 10 years in any event. The judge considered the relevant  test  to
be that in regulation 19(3)(b) of the EEA Regulations 2016,  with  reference
to "serious grounds"  of  public  policy.  He  found  that  the  appellant's
offending behaviour was a one off event at his age and he did not  pose  any
further risk of committing serious crime. He found that the  respondent  had
failed to establish  that  the  appellant's  deportation  was  justified  or
proportionate and he allowed the appeal.

The respondent sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the
grounds that the judge had failed to consider in any substance  whether  the
appellant posed a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  and
whether serious grounds were made out and that  the  judge's  reasoning  was
totally inadequate.

Permission to appeal was granted in the First-tier Tribunal on 9 July 2018.

In a Rule 24 response submitted by legal representatives who had since  been
instructed by the appellant, it was accepted that the  judge  had  erred  in
identifying and  applying  the  correct  law  and  regulations  but  it  was
submitted that that was not a material  error.  The  judge  had  effectively
accepted that the appellant met the ten year period  of  residence  and  the
respondent had failed to show that there were imperative grounds  of  public
security to justify deportation.

Appeal hearing and submissions

The appellant was legally represented before us and  produced  a  bundle  of
documentary evidence including  evidence  that  was  before  the  First-tier
Tribunal and evidence of employment and other matters  which  had  not  been
before the First-tier Tribunal. Both parties made submissions.

Mr Wilding submitted that there was  an  absence  of  reasoned  findings  in
regard to the risk of re-offending. There was no assessment of  whether  the
appellant posed a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat.  It  was
not accepted that the judge's errors in identifying the law and  regulations
were immaterial. It was not sufficient  for  the  judge  to  find  that  the
appellant had been in the UK for ten years in order for him to benefit  from
the imperative grounds test, but he was required to then go on  and  made  a
qualitative assessment of whether  the  appellant's  integrative  links  had
been broken as a result of his imprisonment. Mr Wilding relied on  the  case
of B (Citizenship of the European Union - Right to move and reside freely  -
Enhanced protection against expulsion - Judgment) [2018] EUECJ  C-316/16  in
that respect. With regard to his findings  on  serious  grounds,  the  judge
failed to consider the gravity of the offence and the lack  of  courses  and
rehabilitative work undertaken by the appellant.

Mr Spurling submitted that the judge had accepted the  appellant's  evidence
about his employment and therefore accepted  that  the  appellant  had  been
residing in the UK for over ten years prior  to  his  imprisonment.  In  the
case of B it was considered that imprisonment did  not  automatically  break
the integrative links where 10 years had been established prior to  custody.
The respondent had failed to show that  the  appellant's  integrative  links
had been broken. There had been no challenge to the judge's findings on  the
appellant's length of residence and exercise of treaty rights in the UK  and
there was therefore  sufficient  for  the  imperative  grounds  test  to  be
engaged. Even if the test was serious grounds, the  judge's  decision  still
stood. The judge had considered risk of re-offending at [25] and  noted  the
evidence that the offence had been committed for a reason  and  not  because
the appellant was a serial fraudster. There was no propensity to  re-offend.
The judge's errors were therefore not material.

We advised the parties that we did  not  consider  the  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge to have materially erred in law such that his decision  needed  to  be
set aside. Our reasons for so concluding are as follows.

Consideration and findings.

There cannot be any doubt that the judge's decision is  not  a  thorough  or
well-written one. It refers to the 2006 Regulations  rather  than  the  2016
Regulations, it  is  lacking  in  detailed  reasoning  and  it  lacks  clear
findings on the distinct tests of serious grounds  and  imperative  grounds.
The relevant question,  however,  is  whether  the  decision  is  materially
flawed to the extent that it cannot stand and must be  set  aside.  We  find
that there is sufficient reasoning for the decision to stand  and  that  the
errors made by the judge are not ultimately material.

As Mr Wilding properly submitted, the fact that  ten  years'  residence  and
exercise of treaty rights prior  to  imprisonment  is  accepted  is  not  in
itself sufficient to entitle an applicant to the benefit of  the  imperative
grounds threshold,  as  there  has  to  be  an  assessment  of  whether  the
integrative links to the UK have been broken by the criminal  offending  and
the imprisonment. Plainly the judge did not specifically undertake  such  an
analysis. However, as Mr Spurling submitted, he did  give  consideration  to
the appellant's circumstances overall and to the nature of  and  reason  for
his offending, in line with the reasoning in B at [72] and [73].  The  judge
clearly accepted the appellant's account of his circumstances and length  of
residence in  the  UK  and,  as  Mr  Wilding  confirmed,  those  credibility
findings have not been challenged. Accordingly the  judge's  assessment  was
made on the basis of his acceptance that the appellant had been  living  and
working in the UK for 18 years before his conviction, that  he  had  a  wife
and two sons in the UK (albeit that he was at the time  separated  from  his
wife), that he had no ties to France and that he regretted having  committed
the offence which was a one-off offence resulting  from  a  desire  to  send
money to his mother to pay for her medical care in Sri Lanka. In  the  light
of such accepted evidence we find merit in  Mr  Spurling's  submission  that
there was sufficient for the judge to find that appellant  was  entitled  to
benefit from the imperative grounds threshold.

However, and in any event, it seems from [25] that the judge's decision  was
ultimately made on the basis  of  the  serious  grounds  test  and  we  find
sufficient reasoning to conclude that he was entitled to  allow  the  appeal
on that basis. The respondent's grounds assert  that  the  judge  failed  to
consider whether the appellant posed a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
serious threat and Mr Wilding submitted that the  judge  gave  no  reasoning
for concluding that the appellant did  not  pose  a  risk  of  re-offending.
However the judge did offer some reasoning at  [25],  albeit  brief,  namely
that it was a one-off offence committed by a man of his  age.  Plainly  that
was a reflection  of  the  Crown  Court  Judge's  sentencing  remarks  which
referred to the appellant being a man of 55 years with no previous  blot  on
his otherwise good character.  Further,  whilst  the  respondent's  skeleton
argument refers to a failure by the judge to refer to the OASys  report,  it
is clear from the judge's decision at [7]  that  he  took  the  report  into
account. In any  event  there  is  nothing  in  that  report  to  support  a
conclusion that the appellant posed any risk of re-offending.

It was Mr Wilding's submission that there was no consideration by the  judge
of the appellant's  recognition  of  the  gravity  of  the  offence  and  no
evidence of any courses undertaken by the appellant  in  prison  to  address
his offending. However that was a matter addressed by the appellant  in  his
statement at [5] and [6] and which was supported by evidence of  courses  he
had undertaken in prison. The judge at [18] of his  decision  accepted  that
he had considered all of that evidence and at [21] he made it clear that  he
accepted the appellant's evidence. It is clear that  he  therefore  accepted
the appellant's account of his reason for committing  the  offence  and  his
expression of regret and remorse and that he was aware of the  efforts  made
by the appellant to improve  himself.  Accordingly  we  are  persuaded  that
there was sufficient reasoning provided in  the  judge's  decision  for  the
parties to know why the judge considered that the deportation  decision  was
not justified under the EEA Regulations and why he had allowed  the  appeal.
We are, furthermore, satisfied that it was open to the judge  to  reach  the
conclusions that he did and to allow the appeal on the basis  that  he  did.


For all of these reasons we have decided to uphold the judge's decision.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve  an
error on a point of law requiring it to  be  set  aside.  The  Secretary  of
State's appeal is accordingly dismissed and the decision of  the  First-tier
Tribunal to allow Mr Ratnasingham's appeal stands.
