                                                                  Respondent
Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Adeolu, Lonsdale & Mayall Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as  the  secretary  of  state  and  the
      respondent as "the claimant".


   2. The claimant is a national of Nigeria. His appeal against the decision
      of the secretary of state dated 28 May 2014  to  refuse  to  vary  his
      leave to remain in the UK and to remove him by way of directions under
      s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006  was  allowed
      by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  A  A  Wilson,  in   a   determination
      promulgated on 6 February 2015.


   3. The claimant applied on 1 October 2013 for further leave to remain  as
      the spouse of a person present and settled in the UK.


   4. It was noted that  the  claimant  entered  the  UK  as  a  student  in
      September 2010 and was granted further leave as a Tier 1 HS Post Study
      Migrant until 28 October 2013.


   5. His application was considered under Appendix FM R-LTRP 1.1 (c) of the
      rules. This requires that for limited leave to remain as a partner the
      applicant  must  not  fall  foul  for  refusal  under  Section  S-LTR:
      Suitability Leave to Remain  -  and  meets  all  the  requirements  of
      eligibility to remain as  a  partner.  The  relationship  between  the
      applicant and his partner must be genuine and subsisting and they must
      intend to live together permanently in the UK.


   6. The secretary of state stated that the claimant and  his  partner,  Ms
      Omotayo-Amoa Barnidele, were interviewed in May 2014. There were  many
      discrepancies noted between their accounts. The secretary of state was
      thus not satisfied that  the  marriage  is  subsisting  or  that  they
      intended to live together permanently.


   7. The secretary of state did not determine whether the claimant met  the
      minimum income requirements under R-LTRP 1.1as she had an  outstanding
      legal challenge before the courts relating  to  the  income  threshold
      requirement.  However,  regardless  of  whether  the  minimum   income
      requirement had been met, his application fell for refusal  under  the
      rules.


   8. The secretary of state considered the application under  EX.1  but  it
      was not accepted that their relationship was  genuine  and  subsisting
      and they therefore failed to fulfil EX.1 (b) of Appendix FM.


   9. The application was also refused  under  paragraph  276ADE(1)  of  the
      rules.


  10. Nor were there any exceptional circumstances warranting  consideration
      by the secretary of state of a grant of leave outside the requirements
      of the Immigration Rules.


  11. The claimant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  asserted
      that the claimant's relationship  with  his  sponsor  is  genuine  and
      subsisting and they intend to live together permanently in the UK.  It
      was  also  asserted  that  the  sponsor's  combined  salary  and  self
      employment income exceeds the required financial level requirement  of
      �18,600 per annum.


  12. Judge Wilson referred to the decision to call  the  claimant  and  his
      spouse for an interview. It was not  accepted  that  the  relationship
      with his partner is genuine and subsisting. Judge Wilson  stated  that
      "you therefore failed to  fulfil  EX.1  (b)  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
      rules"[2].


  13. However, as noted, the secretary of state had refused his  application
      under the five year route and  was  not  satisfied  that  he  met  the
      requirements of R  LTRP.1.1  (c)  setting  out  the  requirements  for
      limited leave to remain as a partner.


  14. In his application on FLR (M) the claimant claimed on the basis of his
      being  married  to  his  partner.  He  asserted  that  the   financial
      requirements were  met.  His  sponsor's  total  combined  income  from
      salaried employment was stated to be �30,727.36.


  15. Judge Wilson did not expressly refer to the fact that the secretary of
      state refused the application as he did not meet the requirements of R-
      LTRP.1.1(c) of the Rules.


  16. Judge Wilson had  regard  to  the  claimant's  interview,  noting  the
      discrepancies relied on.


  17. The claimant and his sponsor attended the hearing and  gave  evidence.
      There was no  supporting  evidence  from  his  wife's  family  or  his
      stepchildren. They had wished for the son to  attend  but  he  had  to
      commence work at noon. The matter could only be dealt  with  by  Judge
      Wilson as a float later on.


  18. Both the claimant and his spouse were extensively  questioned  by  the
      Home Office Presenting Officer.  It was accepted  through  photographs
      produced at the hearing that there clearly had been a wedding ceremony
      attended by various persons and friends. There was some  documentation
      in relation to utility bills to the same address, which  however  post
      dated the decision.


  19. Mr Adeolu who also represented  the  claimant  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal submitted that there was a genuine marriage and in accordance
      with the normal rules if leave was granted it would be for  a  limited
      period.


  20. The Judge stated that this was an application  under  the  Immigration
      Rules and that the  burden  was  on  the  claimant  to  show  that  he
      satisfied the requirements [12]. There was a burden  on  him  to  show
      that the marriage is subsisting. He had regard in that respect to  all
      the circumstances. Both  parties  stated  that  they  met  before  the
      marriage and after marriage they are indeed living together.


  21. The Judge found that apart from their age  difference,  there  was  no
      evidence that could lead to a finding that  this  was  a  marriage  of
      convenience. On the balance of probabilities, he  was  satisfied  that
      the parties  are  in  a  genuine  relationship.  Accordingly,  he  was
      satisfied that the respondent's decision  was  made  on  an  erroneous
      assessment of the facts.


  22. Following submissions, he required the parties to submit  whether  the
      case should then be remitted to the secretary of state for  a  further
      decision is his finding was in favour of the claimant  or  whether  he
      should make the decision itself. The difficulty was that the secretary
      of state had not considered whether the  minimum  income  requirements
      had been met as the claim fell under the primary consideration of  the
      rules [13].


  23. As this had not been considered at all by the secretary of  state,  he
      was satisfied that this was an appropriate case for the matter  to  be
      returned to the secretary of state for a lawful decision.


  24. Judge Wilson then stated under the heading "Notice of  Decision"  that
      the "appeal [is] allowed." In a further paragraph below that he  found
      that EX.1 (b) was satisfied in that the claimant  has  a  genuine  and
      subsisting relationship with a partner who is  in  the  UK  and  is  a
      British citizen settled here and there are insurmountable obstacles to
      family life with the partner continuing outside the UK.


  25. On 26 February 2012,  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Garratt granted the secretary of state permission to appeal.


  26. The grounds submitted in the application for permission contended that
      the Judge had erred in applying the burden of proof, which constituted
      a flawed approach. However, Mr Whitwell however stated that he did not
      seek to rely on the first ground.   I agree that  there  is  no  error
      such error.


  27. The second ground referred to the Judge's conclusion that the claimant
      is in a genuine and subsisting marriage and  that  the  appellant  had
      satisfied  the  provisions  of  paragraph  EX.1(b).  However,  it   is
      contended  that  the  Judge  had  not  established  that  there   were
      insurmountable obstacles in this case. No reference was  made  to  any
      factors that would preclude the parties  from  enjoying  their  family
      life together outside the UK. That constituted a material error.


  28. Judge Garratt  stated  that  the  consideration  of  section  EX.1  is
      arguably flawed because of the Judge's failure to consider the  second
      limb of that requirement.


  29. Mr Adeolu submitted that the application was made  under  Appendix  FM
      and not under EX.1. The claimant was required to show that there was a
      subsisting and genuine relationship. The issue on appeal  was  whether
      or not there was a genuine relationship and that the parties  intended
      to live together permanently in the UK.


  30. Having assessed  the  evidence,  the  Judge  was  satisfied  that  the
      claimant had  shown  that  the  marriage  was  subsisting.  The  Judge
      considered  the  facts  presented  and  has  giving   proper   reasons
      justifying that finding.


  31. He submitted that there was no reason for  the  Judge  to  add,  after
      allowing the appeal, that he found that EX.1(b) was satisfied,  namely
      that there was a genuine and subsisting relationship  and  that  there
      are insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.




  32. Mr Adeolu  submitted  that  the  facts  were  in  any  event  properly
      "pleaded" before the Judge. He  referred  to  the  witness  statements
      presented to the Judge. The claimant set out in detail the effect of a
      move to Nigeria. He had established himself in employment  within  the
      limit of the law and scope of his leave  (paragraph  12).  His  family
      cannot move to Nigeria as  his  wife  and  children  are  all  British
      citizens. He will not be able to look after them. He will not be  able
      to secure employment there. He has no savings in  Nigeria  or  a  home
      there. His family would  be  subjected  to  living  in  degrading  and
      inhuman conditions.  If removed, this would have a devastating  effect
      on his wife and stepchildren and on the family as a  whole.  It  would
      have a detrimental psychological and emotional effect on them as  well
      as himself.


  33. In his wife's witness statement, she too set out  from  paragraphs  13
      onwards what the effect of his removal would be. He would not be  able
      to maintain their relationship. She would not be able to visit him  in
      Nigeria as frequently as she would wish, having regard to  the  costs.
      He would obviously not be able to visit the UK for the same reason.


  34. She referred  to  the  emotional  and  psychological  effects  of  his
      removal.  Her  children  would  be  adversely  affected  as  they  are
      beginning to enjoy having a father in their life.


  35. Mr Adeolu submitted that in the  circumstances,  although  no  reasons
      were given at the end of the determination, it  is  evident  from  the
      evidence presented and the Judge's acceptance of their  evidence  that
      there would be  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  his
      partner continuing outside the UK.


  36. Mr Adelou also submitted that in  the  reasons  for  her  refusal  the
      secretary of state considered paragraph EX.1.  She did not accept that
      the relationship  was  genuine  and  subsisting.  There  had  been  no
      reference to the insurmountable obstacles component in EX.1(b) as part
      of that decision.


  37. He further submitted that even assuming that there is an error of law,
      in the circumstances it was not material.


  38. With regard to the financial requirements, it had been agreed  between
      the parties  that  the  maintenance  requirement  in  the  application
      remained outstanding.


  39. Mr Whitwell noted that the claimant stated in his application that  he
      was applying as the spouse of a person present and settled in the  UK.
      Mr Whitwell also submitted that the secretary of  state  had  in  fact
      refused the application under EX.1(b), which included the  requirement
      that there be  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing
      abroad.


     Assessment


  40. The secretary of state refused the claimant's  application  under  the
      relationship requirements of Appendix FM, finding that he had not  met
      the suitability requirements for leave to remain. That was because she
      was not satisfied that the  marriage  was  subsisting  and  that  they
      intended to  live  together  permanently  as  husband  and  wife.  The
      secretary of state went on to  consider  the  claim  under  EX.1  also
      finding that they did not have a genuine and subsisting relationship.


  41. It also appears that the secretary of state stated in  terms  that  he
      failed to fulfil EX.1(b) of Appendix FM without  limiting  herself  to
      the nature of the relationship. I do not accept Mr Adeolu's submission
      that there was a concession, implied or  otherwise,  that  there  were
      insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing abroad.


  42. Judge Wilson found that the claimant had however met the  requirements
      of Appendix FM R-LTRP.1.1 (c) and that the marriage was subsisting. He
      has given full reasons for coming to that conclusion and  in  granting
      permission to appeal Judge Garratt in fact refused permission  on  the
      grounds  asserting  that  there  had  been  a  material   misdirection
      regarding the finding that the marriage was genuine.


  43. Permission was given only in  relation  to  EX.1  which  was  arguably
      flawed  for  the  failure  to  consider  the  second  limb   of   that
      requirement.


  44. It is evident that the claimant applied on the  appropriate  form  for
      leave to remain as the spouse of a person present and settled  in  the
      UK. The secretary of state considered his application on that basis.


  45. Judge Wilson found that the secretary of state's  assertion  that  the
      relationship was not genuine and subsisting  and  that  they  did  not
      intend to live together permanently as husband and wife in the UK, was
      wrong.


  46. He found that  the  claimant  had  therefore  satisfied  the  relevant
      requirements for limited leave to remain as a partner  in  section  R-
      LTRP.


  47. Having come to that conclusion Judge Wilson decided that the issue  of
      maintenance  should  be  returned  to  the  secretary  of  state   for
      consideration, and ordered that a full lawful decision should be made.
      That was the only matter outstanding. That was a course that had  been
      agreed as appropriate by the parties at the hearing.


  48. Judge Wilson further stated after expressly allowing the  appeal  that
      he was satisfied that EX.1(b) was satisfied and that included the fact
      that there were insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  continuing
      outside the UK.


  49. It may not have been necessary for Judge Wilson to find that EX.1  had
      been satisfied, having already concluded that  the  claimant  met  the
      relevant requirements for limited leave to remain as a partner and  R-
      LTRP.1.1(c).


  50. However, he was also satisfied that EX.1  (b)  had  been  met  and  in
      particular that there were insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
      with his partner continuing outside the UK.


  51. Although there are no reasons set out in the paragraph at the  end  of
      the determination, it is  evident  that  he  had  had  regard  to  the
      evidence given by both the claimant and his  spouse.  There  had  been
      extensive cross examination by the Home Office Presenting Officer.


  52. Part of that evidence  related  to  the  reasons  given  by  both  the
      claimant and his wife in their witness statement as to the devastating
      effect that his return to Nigeria would  have  both  on  the  claimant
      himself as well as on his spouse and stepchildren.


  53. Although it might have been advisable to set this out  again,  I  find
      that the decision as  a  whole  makes  sense,  having  regard  to  the
      material which was accepted by the Judge.


  54. I have had regard to the decision in Shizad (Sufficiency  of  reasons:
      Set aside) [2013] UKUT  00085(IAC).  The  Tribunal  also  stated  that
      although a decision may contain an error of law where the requirements
      to give adequate reasons are not met, the  Upper  Tribunal  would  not
      normally set aside a decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  when  there
      has been no misdirection of law, the fact finding  process  cannot  be
      criticised and the relevant  country  guidance  has  been  taken  into
      account, unless the conclusions the Judge draws from the primary  data
      were not reasonably open to him.


         Notice of Decision


    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    any material errors of law and shall accordingly stand.


         No anonymity direction is made.
