For the Appellant:     Miss L Appiah, Counsel, instructed by Charles Annon
& Co
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer

1. Neither Boultif v Switzerland [2001] 33 EHRR 50 nor Amrollahi  v  Denmark
(11 July 2002) is authority for the proposition that  the  burden  of  proof
lies on  the  respondent  to  show  that  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  an
applicant's family to accompany him to his own country of origin  (where  he
has a right of  residence  and  where  it  is  probable  his  country  makes
provision in its immigration law for family reunion).

2. The European Court of Human Rights has not seen  a  period  of  delay  of
limited duration (before an applicant can be considered for re-admission  to
the country where he had established family ties) as in itself  giving  rise
to disproportionality: see e.g. Kaya v Germany Appn. No.  31753/02  28  June
2007), [2007] Imm AR 802, para 68.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Algeria.  In a determination notified on
    6 March 2008 a Tribunal panel (Immigration Judge Freestone  and  Mrs  M
    Padfield JP) dismissed his appeal against a decision dated 21  December
    2007 to make a deportation order  under s.5(1) of the  Immigration  Act
    1971.   The  appellant  was  successful  in  obtaining  an  order   for
    reconsideration in respect of his Article 8 claim only.

2.   The first two grounds for reconsideration take issue with  the  panel's
    finding that it was reasonable to  expect  the  appellant's  family  to
    accompany him to Algeria. It  is  said  that  this  finding  evinced  a
    failure to take into account judgements of the European Court on  Human
    Rights (ECtHR), in particular that of Boultif v Switzerland  [2001]  33
    EHRR 50 and Amrollahi v Denmark (11 July 2002) which indicated that  in
    assessing this issue the burden of proof lay on the respondent, not (as
    the Immigration Judge stated at paragraph 33) on the appellant.  It  is
    next said that this finding also involved a failure  to  give  adequate
    reasons  or  take  accurate  account  of  the  true  position  of   the
    appellant's family members. Once again reference was made to  judgments
    of the ECtHR, Boultif, and Sezen v Netherlands (31  January  2006),  as
    well as two UK cases, Huang [2007] UKHL 11, [2007] 2  WLR  581  and  AB
    (Jamaica) [2007] EWCA Civ 1302.  The third ground  for  reconsideration
    contends that in reaching its alternative finding (that the appellant's
    deportation was proportionate, even if it is unreasonable to expect his
    family to accompany him to  Algeria) the panel erred in law in  failing
    to take into account the appellant's side of  the  scales  and  thereby
    failed to conduct any kind of meaningful balancing exercise at all.

3.   I have some difficulty with the submission dealing  with  the  question
    of upon whom the burden of proof lies  to  show  that  the  appellant's
    partner and children could not accompany him to live in  Algeria.   The
    two ECtHR cases cited in support, Boultif and Amrollahi, only refer  to
    it "not been established" by the respondent government that the  couple
    and family could live "elsewhere" other than in the applicant's country
    of origin.  In  Boultif v Switzerland  the applicant was  Algerian  and
    the issue was raised by the respondent as to whether the  couple  could
    live in Italy; in Amrollahi v Denmark the applicant was Iranian and one
    of the issues raised by the respondent was that the couple  and  family
    could live in Turkey or Greece.  Neither  case  is  authority  for  the
    proposition that the burden of proof lies on  the  respondent  to  show
    that it is reasonable to expect an applicant's family to accompany  him
    to his own country of origin (where he has a  right  of  residence  and
    where it was probable his country makes provision  in  its  immigration
    law for family reunion). And indeed in the appellant's case Miss Appiah
    conceded that there was no reason to think  that  Algeria  lacked  such
    laws.

4.   Nevertheless I am prepared to accept that the panel's treatment of  the
    issue of the partner and her family accompanying him to live in Algeria
    was legally flawed, since they failed to address adequately  the  issue
    of the additional difficulties the family would encounter in Algeria in
    living there together as a family, notwithstanding the fact  they  were
    not married. The panel appeared to consider that they did not  need  to
    address this issue, since there was no  independent  evidence  to  show
    that the appellant's partner could not gain entry to  Algeria  "as  the
    unmarried partner of an  Algerian national" (paragraph 33) or  that  he
    was estranged from his family in  Algeria due his relationship with his
    partner (paragraph 44). However, the  relevant  criterion  set  out  in
    Boultif and other ECtHR cases  for  evaluating  the  reasonableness  of
    expecting  a partner to accompany an applicant back to his own  country
    is the "seriousness of the difficulties" or the existence or  otherwise
    of "insurmountable obstacles". Given the known fact that Algeria is  an
    Islamic country which has experienced in recent years conflicts between
    the government and fundamentalists, the panel was not entitled,  simply
    by virtue of the lack of "independent evidence" to assume that the lack
    of either a civil or religious (Muslim) marriage tie  would  not  cause
    the couple difficulties, possibly serious ones. It must also  be  borne
    in mind here that their child is, in law, illegitimate.


5.   It may also be that the appellant is entitled to say that  the  panel's
    approach to this issue betrays a failure to apply the guidance given by
    the Court of Appeal in AB (Jamaica).  Whilst  I  maintain  doubts  that
    this case lays down any legal rule about the burden of  proof  (see  VW
    and MO (Article 8  -  insurmountable  obstacles)  Uganda  [2008]  UKAIT
    00021), it is difficult to see that the panel weighed properly  in  the
    balance here the fact that the appellant's partner (like the spouse  in
    AB (Jamaica)) was a British citizen.

6.   However, I do not consider that  the  above  failing  resulted  in  any
    material errors of law on the panel's part.  That is because they  went
    on, in the alternative,  to  find  that  even  if  they  had  found  it
    unreasonable  to  expect  the  appellant's  partner  and  children   to
    accompany him to Algeria, the decision would  still  be  proportionate.
    This alternative  finding  was  based  on  their  assessment  that  the
    appellant  had  a  viable  option  of  entry  clearance.  Despite   the
    appellant's representative's (Mr Jorro's) submissions to  the  contrary
    (see paragraph 20), the panel counted against the appellant that he had
    failed to leave the UK when his leave expired and make  an  application
    in Algeria for entry clearance as a fiancï¿½ (para 35).  The  panel  took
    into account that deportation meant that the  appellant  would  not  be
    able to make an application to return (for a "number  of  years"),  but
    concluded nevertheless that  "this factor is outweighed by  the  nature
    and seriousness of the offending".

7.   I am not persuaded that this alternative finding  was  legally  flawed.
    In arguing to the contrary, the grounds (ground  3)  contend  that  the
    panel  "failed to take any account of  A's  side  of  the  balance  and
    thereby fail[ed] to conduct any kind of meaningful  balancing  exercise
    at all". That argument is totally wrong.  From paragraph 34 onwards the
    panel conducted a careful balancing exercise taking into  account,  not
    only factors counting against the appellant,  but  also  those  in  his
    favour.

8.   At panel 20 the panel  had  noted  the  factors  which  Mr  Jorro  said
    weighed in  his favour:

         "The lack of any previous convictions; the acknowledgement  by  the
         sentencing judge that he had had an 'industrious life';  his  entry
         to the UK on a valid issue; his immediate  admission  of  guilt  on
         arrest; the lack of violence, arson, sex or drugs in his offending;
         the relatively low sentence;  his  inability  to  apply  for  entry
         clearance  for  a  number  of  years  after  deportation  and   his
         relationship which is akin to marriage and  fulfils  the  criterion
         laid out by the respondent in  DP3/06."

9.   In other paragraphs the panel showed that it  took  into  account  that
    the couple lived as a family unit (consisting of the two of them, their
    own child, and his partner's two children from her previous  marriage),
    that they had made an attempt to marry in a civil ceremony  in  October
    2004 and had also sought  to  undergo  a  religious  marriage  ceremony
    (unsuccessfully  due  to  the  mosque's  concerns  about  her  previous
    marriage being still extant), and that the appellant  had  some  health
    problems.

10.  The panel made clear in their decision that  whilst  they  weighed  all
    these factors in the appellant's favour, they had qualifications  about
    several or them, in particular they noted: that both partners must have
    known when they first sought to marry that the appellant's  immigration
    status was precarious; that the appellant's stepchildren  were  not  in
    contact with their father; that despite the sentencing judge describing
    him as "industrious" and working hard to support this family,  in  fact
    (on his own evidence to the panel) he had no permission to work and had
    only  worked  for  a  short  period;   that  the  evidence  about   the
    behavioural difficulties of one of his partner's children (M)  did  not
    show that these were caused by the appellant's  previous  absence;  and
    that the  medical  evidence  he  had  submitted  provided  no  analysis
    assisting the panel  as to  the  nature  and  severity  of  his  health
    difficulties.

11.  For the most part the  grounds  for  reconsideration  do  not  seek  to
    challenge the panel's above qualification of certain factors.  In  para
    13 of the grounds there is a suggestion  that  the  panel  should  have
    attached more weight to the appellant's stepchildren's ties with  their
    natural father, but the panel were fully justified in pointing out that
    there was no real evidence of such ties.

12.  It is true that some  of  the  above  factors  were  identified  and/or
    evaluated in the context of examining the issue of  the  reasonableness
    of the appellant's partner and children accompanying  him  to  Algeria,
    but is quite clear that the panel sought to decide the  separate  issue
    of the viability of the entry clearance option by reference to the same
    balancing of factors in favour and against the appellant. The panel was
    entirely correct to consider that both issues  had  to  be  decided  by
    reference to the overall balancing of factors. Indeed if it had  sought
    to decide such matters by reference to a different balancing  exercise,
    it would have fallen into legal error.

13.  The grounds also suggest that  the  panel  disregarded  completely  the
    interests of the two stepchildren, H, in particular  (ground  22).  But
    the panel clearly understood and took account  of  the  fact  that  the
    family unit consisted of three children (see paragraph 27).

14.  The principal thrust of ground 3 was that the panel had failed to  take
    any account of a number of  factors  relating  to  the  nature  of  the
    appellant's  criminal  offence  and  conviction:  seven   factors   are
    mentioned. However,  these  were  all  factors  which  the  appellant's
    representative had raised in written and oral  submissions.  The  panel
    clearly understood that the appellant's conviction was for two offences
    of possessing false documents with the  intention of  using  them  (see
    para 44); that he had admitted his offence on being challenged; that he
    was sentenced to the minimum punishment  for  this  offence;  that  his
    offence did not involve violence, arson, sex or drugs; that he was  not
    a re-offending risk; and that his twelve  months  prison  sentence  put
    him at the very bottom of  the  level  at  which  the  respondent  will
    generally consider deporting non-EEA nationals.  There  is  nothing  to
    indicate that they considered he had used  a  false  ID  to  enter,  or
    attempt to  enter  the  UK.  Clearly  the  panel  considered  that  the
    appellant's offences were "serious" (para 44), but it cannot  seriously
    be suggested that they were not.  We note also that the panel  did  not
    describe  the  offences  (as  the  grounds  suggest)  as  "particularly
    serious".

15.  It must be borne in mind that  even  if  the  appellant  had  not  been
    convicted of a criminal offence, he was still  an  overstayer  and,  as
    such, the interests of  the  state  in  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control had to be considered as  counting  heavily  against
    the appellant.

16.  Miss Appiah submitted that  the  panel  had  failed  to  take  adequate
    account of the serious disruptions in the appellant's and his  family's
    relationships that deportation would cause, bearing in  mind  that  (as
    someone subject to a decision to deport) he would not be considered for
    entry clearance for three years.  However, leaving aside the fact  that
    the three year rule is only stated in the Immigration Rules to apply in
    cases concerned with revocation of a deportation order  (para  390,  HC
    395), whereas this appellant will only be made subject to a deportation
    order if, following exhaustion of his  appeal  rights,  he  refuses  to
    leave  voluntarily,  the  panel  plainly  did  take  into  account  the
    understanding that he would not be able  to  be  considered  for  entry
    clearance "for a number of years" (paragraph 39). In the light  of  the
    panel's  assessment  of  the  evidence  about  the  appellant  and  the
    different family members, they were quite entitled to find  that  there
    were no exceptional circumstances  excluding the appellant  from  being
    required to return to  Algeria and make an application from  there  for
    entry clearance even though that would not  be  possible  for  "several
    years".  I note that the appellant had the option in  October  2004  of
    returning to Algeria and applying  for  entry  clearance  to  join  his
    partner then, but chose to remain unlawfully.  I  note  also  that  the
    European Court of Human Rights has  not  seen  a  period  of  delay  of
    limited duration  (before  an  applicant  can  be  considered  for  re-
    admission to the country where he had established family  ties)  as  in
    itself giving rise to disproportionality: see e.g. Kaya v Germany Appn.
    No. 31753/02 28 June 2007), [2007] Imm AR 802, para 68 (and  the  cases
    referred to therein, Benhebba v France and Jankov v Germany).

17.  As Mr Walker pointed out, if the panel failed to take into account  any
    relevant factor here, it was a  further  factor  counting  against  the
    appellant,  namely  that  there  would   be  nothing  to  prevent   the
    appellant's partner and children visiting the appellant whilst  he  was
    in Algeria.  Whatever difficulties they might face in efforts to reside
    there as a family, they would be most unlikely to apply in the  context
    of a relatively short visit.

18.  For the above reasons I consider that the  panel's  decision  that  the
    appellant had a viable option of entry clearance was well-reasoned  and
    unaffected by actual (and possible) legal errors.  Error infected  only
    their treatment of  the  separate  issue  of  whether  the  appellant's
    partner and children could accompany him to  Algeria  to  resume  their
    family life there.

19.  For the above reasons the panel's decision to dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal must stand.

  1. The Tribunal is satisfied that, at the  time  the  Appellant  made  the
     Section 103A application and for the reasons  indicated  in  the  SIJ's
     order for reconsideration, there was a significant  prospect  that  the
     appeal would be allowed upon  reconsideration.  Accordingly  it  orders
     that  the  Appellant's  costs  in  respect  of  the   application   for
     reconsideration and in respect of the reconsideration are  to  be  paid
     out of the relevant fund, as defined in  Rule  33  of  the  Asylum  and
     Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005
