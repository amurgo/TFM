Introduction

      1. This application for judicial review raises the issue of  when,  on
         removal by the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  ("the
         Secretary of State") of a  dependent  child,  born  in  the  United
         Kingdom  along  with  his  adult  parent,  there  needs  to  be  an
         independent review of the merits of the child's distinct asylum and
         human rights claims. In this case the Secretary  of  State  removed
         the mother, BF, who was unlawfully  in  the  country,  to  Nigeria,
         along with her son, RA, aged 5, who was born in the United  Kingdom
         when she had no leave to remain here. It is said that the Secretary
         of  State  acted  unlawfully  in  removing  mother  and  son,   not
         considering RA's own position as a claimant in  his  own  right  or
         properly as a dependant within a fresh claim made by him and/or his
         mother, and without  in  his  best  interests  planning  for  their
         reception and protective integration on return to Nigeria.  RA,  it
         is contended, has  an  in  country  right  of  appeal  against  the
         decision to remove him.

      2. The application was expedited for a rolled up hearing. On 17  March
         2015 UT Judge Storey and UT Judge Rintoul refused interim relief in
         the form of the  immediate  return  of  BF  and  RA  from  Nigeria.
         Specifically, the application challenges the Secretary  of  State's
         decisions of 22 and 23 January 2015  to  refuse  to  treat  further
         submissions as a first claim by RA or as a fresh  claim  under  the
         Immigration Rules. RA's litigation friend is  Mrs  KH,  his  foster
         carer in 2013 as we describe later in the judgment. The  Children's
         Commissioner  as  Intervener  has   provided   written   and   oral
         submissions as to what are said to be the general principles to  be
         applied. During the course of the hearing we granted permission  to
         apply for judicial review.

Background

      3. BF is a citizen of Nigeria, presently  45  years  old.  She  is  of
         Yoruba ethnicity and has said that she last  lived  in  Nigeria  in
         Abeokuta, Ogun state. In various statements she has said  that  she
         worked as a prostitute in Nigeria, and later in the United Kingdom.
         She was encountered working illegally in a shop in London, using  a
         false Dutch passport.

      4. On 30 April 2007 BF made a claim for leave to remain in the  United
         Kingdom on the basis of long  residence:  she  said  that  she  had
         entered the United Kingdom and had resided here  since  1991.  That
         was rejected and her appeal came before Immigration Judge McWilliam
         in January 2008, who found  that  she  had  not  been  continuously
         present since 1991. BF had not attended the hearing  since  at  the
         time she was in prison for using the false Dutch  passport,  having
         been sentenced to 9 months imprisonment in October 2008.

      5. RA was born on 28 August 2009.  BF  has  stated  that  RA's  father
         disappeared when she was two months pregnant and there has been  no
         contact since.

      6. On the 6  April  2010,  BF  made  an  application  for  asylum  and
         humanitarian protection on the basis that  she  feared  persecution
         and ill-treatment on return to Nigeria. On her account she lost her
         parents and siblings in a car accident and her  father's  relatives
         tried to get her to marry someone she did  not  love  and  who  was
         older than she was. She had an uncle and aunt but  they  would  not
         accept her with an illegitimate child.  On  one  interpretation  of
         what she said she had been educated up to her late  teens.  RA  was
         named in the asylum application as BF's dependant.

      7. The application  was  refused,  the  refusal  letter  containing  a
         fleeting reference to BF having a son.  The  Secretary  of  State's
         section 10 notices of removal were served on both  BF  and  RA,  RA
         being said to have an out of country right of appeal.

      8. The grounds of appeal were three: that she was a Nigerian  national
         who had been outside her country for twenty years, that she  had  a
         valid fear to return to Nigeria and  the  Secretary  of  State  had
         failed to  take  account  of  the  objective  information  and  the
         availability of protection or relocation, and that she had  Article
         8 rights with her length of residence in the  United  Kingdom  (her
         long residence). There was no reference made to any claim  made  on
         behalf of RA.

      9. BF appealed unsuccessfully. No separate appeal was brought  by  RA,
         who was at that time only a year old and the determination  records
         that BF had not made any separate statement of  additional  grounds
         under section 120. BF was present at the  hearing,  she  gave  oral
         evidence and was represented. In the  determination  of  18  August
         2010 Immigration  Judge  Cope  confirmed  the  earlier  finding  of
         Immigration Judge McWilliam and rejected BF's claim to having  been
         in this country since 1991: the documents supporting the claim were
         in the main fabricated. Coupled with other  matters  (for  example,
         clearly conflicting accounts of how she came  to  Britain  and  the
         length of time taken before making her claim for asylum) the  judge
         said that BF could not be accepted as a witness of truth. Indeed he
         did not accept  anything  BF  said  about  events  in  Nigeria.  He
         considered the  case  advanced  on  Article  8  grounds  and  after
         conducting a proportionality assessment reached the conclusion that
         it was not a case where the interests of BF and her son  outweighed
         the  interests  of  society  as  a  whole.  As  a  result  of   the
         determination, BF became appeal rights exhausted.

     10. On 24 August 2012 the solicitors who acted for BF until she and  RA
         were removed earlier this year made further representations to  the
         Secretary of State as a fresh claim under  the  Immigration  Rules.
         These made reference to the  existence  of  RA  and  his  wellbeing
         should  they  be  removed.  He  was  at  a  crucial  stage  of  his
         development  and  the  difficulties  his  mother  would   find   in
         reintegrating into Nigerian society would have adverse implications
         for him. The Secretary  of  State  refused  to  treat  the  further
         representations as giving rise to a fresh claim.

     11. BF was now living in Gateshead with RA  in  accommodation  arranged
         through the Secretary of State and in receipt of some ï¿½96.90 weekly
         (the rate at the point  of  departure).  She  was  in  the  country
         unlawfully and liable to be removed. As such the Secretary of State
         had a continuing interest in her and  she  was  obliged  to  report
         periodically. On 1 March 2013 the Secretary of State contacted  the
         local  authority's  social  services  department  in  Gateshead  to
         inquire if BF and RA were known to them. She was  told  that  there
         had been two referrals to social services, one due to  there  being
         no answer when a health visitor called, the other from a nurse when
         RA was ill and taken to hospital. No further action had been  taken
         in either case. Three days later, on 4 March,  when  reporting,  BF
         stated that RA  had  speech  and  language  problems  and  a  sugar
         allergy. BF was advised to speak to RA to explain that he  may  not
         be able to remain in Britain and to inform RA's nursery.  Barnardos
         leaflets about available assistance relevant for RA were  given  to
         BF.

     12. On the 15 March 2013 the Secretary of State set removal  directions
         for BF and RA. Appeal forms were served on both BF and RA, the  one
         for RA stating that his right of appeal was out of country.

     13. On 18 March 2013 BF's solicitors made what  they  asserted  was  "a
         fresh  asylum  and  human  rights  application  under  the  Refugee
         Convention,  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  and  the   EU
         Qualification Regulations 2006". BF, they said,  would  be  a  lone
         woman returning to  Nigeria  without  any  family  or  support  and
         destitution would be  the  result.  To  place  a  child  into  that
         situation would be contrary to his welfare. It was against his best
         interests to remove him when he was three and at a  vital  time  in
         his development. He had a private life here.

     14. As part of the  representations  there  was  an  expert  report  of
         Professor Mario Aguilar dealing with BF and another Nigerian woman.
         He could not  grasp  how  the  two  women  or  the  children  could
         reintegrate in Nigerian society when they had  no  welfare  support
         there. He stated that single women on their own  in  Nigeria  faced
         the risk of  trafficking  and  being  regarded  as  witches.  Their
         children faced the same risks. The police were ineffective. We note
         that the expert Aguilar report  also  stated  that  their  children
         faced these risks.

     15. The Secretary of  State  replied  on  23  April  2013.  The  letter
         referred to the solicitors' representations raising Article 8  ECHR
         issues for BF and that it would be in RA's best interests to remain
         here. The letter stated that there was no evidence that BF did  not
         have extended family in Nigeria. RA was only young and could easily
         adapt to Nigeria. The  representations  were  refused  as  a  fresh
         claim.

     16. When reporting on 27 March 2013 BF stated that RA was fine  and  at
         school. When BF became upset, she was advised to consider  applying
         for Assisted Voluntary Return, to prepare her son  for  return  and
         not to scare him. Early the following month, the Secretary of State
         received  medical  records  from  BF's  GP.  On  5  April  2013  BF
         telephoned that  RA  was  in  hospital  on  a  drip  with  constant
         vomiting. When  reporting  five  days  later,  BF  brought  RA.  On
         inquiry, BF said that RA had been  discharged  from  hospital,  was
         drinking only water and eating little, but there  were  no  further
         problems and his return to nursery  on  the  Monday  was  expected.
         Social services were  contacted  but  there  had  been  no  further
         referrals. On 17 April 2013, BF advised that RA was  well  and  had
         returned to nursery. When reporting on 24  April  2013,  BF  stated
         that RA was OK and at nursery.

     17. RA's school and a local MP became involved. BF had told the  school
         that if they were returned to  Nigeria  BF  would  be  forced  into
         marriage and RA  killed.  The  Secretary  of  State's  process  for
         removal was explained to the school. On 24 April RA's head  teacher
         emailed the local MP expressing grave concerns that BF  might  harm
         herself and RA if they were returned to Nigeria. The  Secretary  of
         State attempted to contact the school, telephoned social  services,
         and prepared a safeguarding referral form and a letter to  the  MP.
         The following day,  the  Secretary  of  State  contacted  the  head
         teacher and social services.  The  head  teacher  stated  that  the
         concerns were her own, not that BF had stated that she  would  harm
         herself or RA. She reported that RA was absent from school one  day
         as BF reported feeling very weak, but he was now  back  in  school,
         although unusually quiet and tearful at  times.  The  head  teacher
         said that she would advise social services of BF and RA's behaviour
         later in the week.

     18. On 26 April 2013  the  Secretary  of  State's  officials  contacted
         social services for  an  update.  A  social  worker  had  not  been
         allocated to the case but a duty social worker had  spoken  to  the
         school and BF. BF had stated that she was extremely low  but  there
         was no risk to herself or RA.

     19. BF and RA were due to be removed to Nigeria on 30 April 2013.  They
         failed to show for a  self  check  removal.  That  day  the  school
         reported that RA was away from school. BF could not  be  contacted.
         Social services were involved. On 3  May  2013  a  local  authority
         social worker advised the Secretary of State that BF  had  admitted
         herself to a psychiatric ward due to her mental state and  thoughts
         of drinking bleach.

     20. For some time BF had received medical care for her  mental  health.
         In 2010 she was recorded as being depressed and  suicidal  and  was
         prescribed  medication  for  hypertension.  There  was   continuing
         contact with the GP  in  the  following  years.  In  hospital  BF's
         allocated nurse concluded that BF's condition was reactive  to  her
         current situation, not psychosis. The  psychiatric  assessment  was
         that BF was not psychotic but had  circumstantial  depression.  She
         responded well to  treatment.  The  consultant  said  she  had  low
         mood/depression,  no  prominent  problems  or   explicit   suicidal
         ideations, and  that  her  mental  health  issues  related  to  her
         immigration status. She did not  want  to  be  discharged  but  the
         consultant told her that her treatment had been successful and  she
         would be given a community psychiatric nurse. After seven weeks  in
         hospital she was discharged.

     21. At the time BF was in hospital, on the 3 May 2013, a social  worker
         visited RA who had been placed with  a  friend  of  BF's.  She  was
         described as an unfamiliar adult who was struggling to care for  RA
         as well as  her  own  children.  The  hospital  advised  the  local
         authority that at the time BF did not have the capacity to  consent
         to RA being placed in voluntary foster care (as a  placement  under
         section 20 of the  Children  Act  1989)  and  therefore  the  local
         authority made a decision to issue care  proceedings  and  seek  an
         interim care order. This order was made by Newcastle  County  Court
         on the 21 May 2013  to  enable  the  local  authority  to  complete
         assessments  concerning  BF's  mental  health  and  her   parenting
         capacity. The interim care order was in force for  5  months  until
         the 11 October 2013.

     22. After BF was discharged from hospital RA was not  returned  to  her
         care for some four months. An independent social worker engaged  by
         BF's current solicitors opined in a report in March 2015 that  this
         was a lengthy separation for such a young child and  indicated  the
         high level of safeguarding concerns. However, we note that in early
         July 2013 BF had stated to a social worker that she  wanted  RA  to
         remain in foster  care.  The  social  worker  thought  someone  had
         advised BF to say this and so asked BF if  this  would  affect  her
         immigration status.

     23. When RA was placed in foster care the  experienced  foster  carers,
         Kath and David Hayward, noted that his  speech  and  language  were
         delayed; his eating patterns  and  habits  were  abnormal;  he  had
         inappropriate trust in strangers;  and  his  compliance  and  self-
         sufficiency  suggested  a  lack   of   positive   stimulation   and
         interaction from his mother. RA  did  very  well  with  his  foster
         parents. BF in turn  responded  well  with  her  supervised  access
         sessions with her son. The Secretary of State had  agreed  to  vary
         BF's reporting schedule so  she  could  attend  parental  nurturing
         classes. RA expressed the wish to return to his mother.

     24. On the 28 August 2013 a decision making meeting was held to discuss
         the progress made by BF, including  her  work  with  mental  health
         professionals in which  her  issues  were  addressed.  The  meeting
         identified  that  any  further  mental  health  support  would   be
         available for BF from her GP. BF had  also  completed  a  parenting
         assessment which was described as positive. As a result a  decision
         was taken that RA should return to the care of his mother under the
         auspices of a Supervision Order to provide support for BF's  mental
         health and support for her parenting of RA.

     25. On the 11 October 2013, a hearing took place  at  Newcastle  County
         Court. Whilst this was prior to the legislative changes made in the
         guidance set out in Practice  Direction  12A  (Public  Law  Outline
         2014) and the other relevant changes  to  Part  12  of  the  Family
         Procedure  Rules  2010  (as  now  amended),  an  Issues  Resolution
         Hearing("IRH") took place. Where it is possible for all the  issues
         in the court proceedings to be resolved at the IRH, the  court  may
         treat the IRH as a final hearing and make orders disposing  of  the
         proceedings. This took place and a Supervision Order  was  made  in
         favour of the local authority for one year's duration.

     26. (We note that neither the applicants' legal representatives nor the
         Secretary of State have not sought  to  obtain  disclosure  of  the
         documentation generated  in  the  care  proceeding,  including  the
         Guardian's report or a copy of the care plan. As the hearing at the
         IRH was treated as a final hearing, the court would  have  recorded
         on the face of the order (or in a separate document attached to the
         order) how the threshold criteria were met under section  31(2)  of
         the Children Act 1989, either by agreement between the  parties  or
         by the judge reaching a decision on the evidence. While  we  accept
         that it is only if the threshold  is  crossed  that  a  supervision
         order could be made, we observe that we have not had sight  of  any
         such documentation. We note that the key distinction between a care
         and  supervision  order  is  that  a  care  order  gives   parental
         responsibility for a child to the  local  authority  and  gives  it
         power to determine the  extent  to  which  a  parent  may  exercise
         parental responsibility: see section  33(3).  Under  a  supervision
         order parental responsibility remains with the parent but the local
         authority have a duty to advise, assist and befriend the supervised
         child supported by the powers in Schedule 3, parts 1 and 2.)

     27. The Secretary of State had decided in August 2013 not to remove  BF
         and RA while any supervision order was in force.

     28. On 19  March  2014  the  solicitors  acting  for  BF  made  further
         representations.  There   was   substantial   repetition   of   the
         representations of the previous year. Passages from the Country  of
         Origin Information Report of 14 June  2013  were  inserted  in  the
         letter. Mother and son were  at  risk.  It  was  not  in  his  best
         interests to be removed since he  was  at  a  vital  stage  of  his
         development.  The  letter  did  not  refer  to  BF's  admission  to
         hospital, RA being  taken  into  the  interim  care  of  the  local
         authority or  the  circumstances  leading  to  the  making  of  the
         supervision order.

     29. The Secretary of State rejected the 19  March  2014  claims  on  25
         September 2014. When doing so she referred to  the  representations
         being made on behalf of BF and her dependant son as a fresh  asylum
         claim and as a claim under Articles 3 and  8  ECHR.  Amongst  other
         things the Secretary of State concluded that the risk of  BF  being
         forced into prostitution was speculative. Neither BF  nor  her  son
         had demonstrated that there was a real  risk  to  their  Article  3
         rights. As to the Article 8 rights of the two, they  did  not  fall
         within the Immigration Rules. The letter referred to section 55  of
         the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009.  No  reasonable
         circumstances had been adduced which would prevent RA's  return  to
         Nigeria with  his  mother.  There  was  no  evidence  that  he  had
         developed  any  significant  private  life   outside   his   family
         environment.  Education  and  health  services  were  available  in
         Nigeria. It was in the best interests of RA to accompany his mother
         on her return to Nigeria.

     30. During 2014 there were exchanges of information between  the  local
         authority and the Secretary of State. On  11  September  2014,  the
         local authority was informed that the plan would be for BF  and  RA
         to be removed to Nigeria when  the  supervision  order  expired  in
         October but that BF was not to be told in advance  because  in  the
         past this severely affected her  mental  health.  On  29  September
         2014, the local authority sent the Secretary of State its child  in
         need assessment, the child in need plans and the care team minutes.

     31. The supervision order expired on the 18 October 2014.It is recorded
         in the statement of Zoey Hughes dated 27 January 2015, to which  we
         return later in the judgment, that after RA had  been  returned  to
         her  care  in  October  2013,  and  during  the  operation  of  the
         supervision order, BF had engaged in all necessary  support  ,  was
         aware of her Wellness Recovery Action Plan (if  required)  and  had
         completed work with Children North East  (dealing  with  issues  of
         routines and boundaries) and also two  programmes  to  develop  her
         parenting  skills,  the  Magic  123  programme  and  the  nurturing
         programme.

     32. When the Secretary of State contacted the  local  authority  on  14
         October 2014, it reported that BF was upset at the rejection of her
         latest submissions and appeared to need more contact. However,  she
         was hopeful since her solicitor was looking  for  a  loophole.  The
         social worker reported that the supervision order was due to expire
         on 18 October, and that there was to be a meeting to  downgrade  RA
         from being a child in need and to end the involvement of the  local
         authority children services department.

     33. On 12 November 2014 the Secretary of State conducted  a  heath  and
         welfare interview with BF. BF stated that her son was  healthy  but
         her own health was not good. That  day  the  Secretary  of  State's
         family engagement manager spoke to the  Office  of  the  Children's
         Champion within the Home Office  to  discuss  the  case.  A  family
         welfare form was opened so that it could be provided  to  the  Home
         Office Family Return Panel. The  family  welfare  form  provided  a
         background to the case, including the psychiatric problems which BF
         had had, and the history of developmental problems of  RA  and  the
         care history. The following week, a list of BF's medicines was sent
         to the Secretary of State's family team to consider.

     34. The last of the local authority child in need meetings about RA was
         held on 26 November 2014. It identified a risk that RA might not be
         provided with a safe and secure environment at  home  due  to  BF's
         mental health. It could affect his health and well-being. The local
         authority considered closing the case but  BF  had  requested  that
         they remain involved because she felt incredibly low.

     35. On 16 December 2014 the Home Independent Office Family Return Panel
         met. It was attended  by  a  representative  of  the  Secretary  of
         State's Office of the Children's Champion. Its purpose was to  make
         arrangements for the removal of BF and RA to Nigeria. It considered
         the history of the local authority's involvement, BF's  history  of
         mental illness, RA's history of delayed speech, his  schooling  and
         the significant progress he had made when living  with  his  foster
         parents. It noted that a child in need plan was in place and  there
         were no immediate concerns regarding  RA.  BF  had  undertaken  two
         parenting courses. BF had two bank  accounts  and  a  partner.  The
         panel chair noted that the local  authority  would  not  have  been
         "prepared to let them go if there was anything  further  that  they
         could do for the family". The meeting also  considered  support  on
         return. The record of the meeting was sent to the local authority.

     36. BF saw her GP, Dr Rana, on 19 December 2014. The GP had recorded  a
         series of depressive episodes in the past.  On  this  occasion  she
         recorded BF's low  mood  and  increased  her  anti-depressant  dose
         (Fluoxetine) to 40mg daily.

     37. BF and RA were detained on 20 January 2015. Directions for  removal
         had been issued again and appeal forms  (with  an  out  of  country
         right of appeal in respect of RA) again served. A medic was present
         who assessed  BF  and  approved  the  detention.  RA's  school  was
         informed. The following day the family seemed to have settled  into
         Cedars, the  immigration  centre,  very  well  and  there  were  no
         concerns. RA interacted well  with  the  staff  and  Barnardos  had
         planned activities for him for the day.

     38. On 22 January 2015 BF advised Barnardos that RA had asked why  they
         were at Cedars and she  told  him  they  were  being  detained  but
         nothing further. She would not agree to  Barnardos  talking  to  RA
         about their removal to Nigeria. RA continued to engage and interact
         well with staff at Cedars and had activities planned for  the  day.
         There were no issues with his eating or drinking. Barnardos had  no
         concerns regarding BF's parenting capabilities.

     39.  That  day,  22  January  2015,  BF's   solicitors   made   further
         representations on behalf of "our client", BF, as  a  fresh  claim.
         The application  began  with  BF's  mental  illness,  the  risk  of
         deterioration if removed, the deficiencies in mental health care in
         Nigeria, and the consequent breach of her Article 3 and 8 rights on
         return. Secondly, BF would be  unlikely  to  obtain  employment  in
         Nigeria with no childcare. The likely destitution "would provide an
         additional risk to the health and  wellbeing  of  herself  and  her
         young child, and present an additional Article 3 breach."

     40. Thirdly, the  letter  stated,  BF  and  her  son  had  built  up  a
         significant private life here. BF's strong links with the community
         were shown by the fact that 4,000  people  had  signed  a  petition
         opposing their removal. In respect of RA, he was at a vital time in
         his development and removal would  have  an  extremely  detrimental
         effect on his well-being. The law required that regard  be  had  to
         RA's best interests. The family had nothing to return to and  there
         was a risk of homelessness and destitution. It  was  in  RA's  best
         interests  to  remain  here.  It  was  likely  that  removal  would
         exacerbate BF's condition  and  RA  needed  a  secure  environment.
         Citing information from the Home Office Country of  Origin  Report,
         June 2013, the letter stated that Nigeria would not be safe  for  a
         child in the position of RA. He would face destitution,  be  unable
         to access education, and risked becoming a street child.  He  would
         be extremely vulnerable and it would be completely  detrimental  to
         his well-being.

     41. Included with the letter were copies of BF's medical records and  a
         letter from BF's GP,  Dr  Rana,  dated  21  January,  opining  that
         removal would exacerbate her mental health issues.

     42. Dated 22 January 2015 was a report from Zoey  Hughes,  one  of  the
         local authority's safeguarding and care  planning  social  workers.
         After summarizing its intervention she wrote that BF and RA

             "have a lovely and warm relationship and [RA] appears happy in
             the care of his Mum...[RA] remains as a Child in Need, this is
             due to concerns regarding [BF]'s  mental  health  difficulties
             [which] appear to centre around the  possibility  of  her  and
             [RA] being deported back to Nigeria. At present  [BF]  appears
             to be managing well with parenting... Despite [BF]'s low mood,
             [RA] has continued to present well; they (sic)  have  been  no
             concerns from  school...  At  the  last  care  meeting  on  20
             November 2014, closing [RA]'s case was discussed, due to there
             being  no  further  safeguard  concerns.  However  [BF]   felt
             concerned that her current low mood would impact  upon  [RA]'s
             well-being... Therefore, it was agreed to review the  decision
             to close at the following Care Team Meeting."

     43. The Secretary of State responded to these  further  representations
         the same day, 22 January, refusing to accept them as a fresh claim.
         She referred to Zoey Hughes' positive report,  while  acknowledging
         Dr Rana's opinion that removal to  Nigeria  would  exacerbate  BF's
         mental health issues and that the treatment in Nigeria would not be
         comparable to what is available in  the  United  Kingdom.  However,
         that did not meet the high Article 3  threshold.  The  relationship
         between BF and RA was caring and positive and there was  no  reason
         to presume that this  would  change  after  they  had  left.  Since
         February 2013 BF had been offered support to  re-establish  herself
         in Nigeria. BF's  human  rights  would  not  be  infringed  by  her
         removal. Family life could continue in Nigeria. There could  be  no
         private life claim under the Immigration Rules and no fresh  claim.
         There  was  a  reference   back   to   the   solicitors'   previous
         representations and the Secretary of State's responses.

     44. The next day, 23 January 2015, officials at the immigration  centre
         noted:

             "No safeguarding concerns at present. Barnardos observed  that
             [BF] interacted well with her  son  yesterday."  Exceptionally
             the Secretary of State authorised a payment of ï¿½500  to  cover
             hotel and immediate living expenses on return to  Nigeria.  BF
             had refused to administer anti-malaria medication to RA.  Nets
             and medication were to be packed in their baggage."

     45. The solicitors made further representations that  day,  23  January
         2015, asserting that the Secretary of  State  had  failed  to  have
         regard  to  the  previous  day's  representations  "concerning  the
         wellbeing and possible Article 3 breach upon return of  our  client
         and her son". The letter then extracted verbatim the previous day's
         representations, adding that the public support - a  petition  with
         8000 signatures  -  gave  rise  to  exceptional  circumstances  and
         warranted a grant of discretionary  leave.  With  the  letter  were
         newspaper reports of the concern of RA's head teacher, the progress
         he had made and the school's concern about his safety and emotional
         well-being. There was also  a  letter  from  MIND  confirming  BF's
         referral to counselling.

     46. The Secretary of State replied the same day. "[You] have asked that
         further consideration is given to Article 3 of the ECHR in relation
         to [RA]...". BF had not been accepted  as  a  credible  witness  by
         Immigration Judge Cope in 2010, who had found that she had probably
         arrived in Britain in 2006, which cast doubt on her assertions that
         she was completely without  family  and  friends  in  Nigeria.  The
         letter acknowledged that life for RA  would  not  be  the  same  in
         Nigeria,  but  that  "it  cannot  be  accepted  that  his   changed
         circumstances will be such that they could  amount  to  inhuman  or
         degrading treatment such that the high threshold in Article 3 could
         be breached." BF would be given cash on departure and had been also
         given  information  in  a  resource  pack  about  organisations  to
         approach for assistance there. It was clear that BF would try to do
         whatever she could to safeguard her son  and  ensure  his  welfare,
         including his  schooling.  There  was  no  fresh  claim  under  the
         Immigration Rules.

     47. Later that day, BF and RA were placed on a flight  to  Nigeria.  On
         return to Lagos, for some reason  BF  could  not  access  the  ï¿½500
         provided on the pre-loaded payment card the Secretary of State  had
         provided. A Good Samaritan assisted and  Mrs  Hayward,  the  foster
         carer, contacted the Office  of  the  Children's  Commissioner  who
         spoke to the British High Commission in Abuja. Following  this  the
         High Commission sent a driver to pay BF ï¿½350 in cash sufficient for
         two night's accommodation at a hotel. Subsequently, BF and RA  have
         been provided with financial support by Mrs Hayward personally  and
         from funds she has been able to  raise  from  the  local  Gateshead
         Community. Mrs Hayward has also arranged and paid for medical  care
         for BF.

Post-removal evidence

     48. Following the removal of BF and RA to Nigeria, the  new  solicitors
         acting for them have  obtained  a  number  of  expert  reports  and
         additional materials.

     49. The first expert report  is  by  Carolyne  Willow,  an  experienced
         social worker in both the public and  NGO  sectors,  at  local  and
         national level. She was unable to interview BF and RA  but  on  the
         basis of her review of the documents and experience  has  concluded
         that the Secretary of State should have conducted a 'best interests
         assessment' regarding RA. By the age of 4 or 5 a  child  will  have
         developed significant attachments  to  other  children  and  adults
         outside the family. In RA's case, he had strong attachments in  the
         United Kingdom and no experience of Nigeria. The Secretary of State
         should have considered the likely effect on his being uprooted  and
         removed to Nigeria.

     50. Ms Willow states that the assessment would have covered a range  of
         matters, including the relationship between BF and RA, the  history
         of local authority intervention, the identification of risks to his
         welfare and his mother's capacity to care for him, an  analysis  of
         conditions and social provision for children in Nigeria, the likely
         immediate impact on his welfare of removal, and whether there  were
         available  substitute  carers  should   BF   require   periods   of
         hospitalisation once in Nigeria. When in the United Kingdom RA  had
         been vulnerable and his needs had  not  been  met  by  his  mother.
         Considerable  intervention  from  the  local  authority  and  other
         agencies had  been  necessary.  It  was  of  real  concern  that  a
         vulnerable child had been forcibly uprooted  without  any  detailed
         preparation by the education and social care professionals  working
         with him. If the local authority  had  been  asked  to  provide  an
         opinion on RA's needs  and  best  interests,  it  would  have  been
         required to give due consideration to his own wishes and  feelings.
         That could possibly have involved communication with him  but  also
         with others. Overall there was no adequate assessment of  his  best
         interests and human rights in relation to his removal.

     51. Secondly, Dr Naomi Hartree, a GP with experience  in  the  care  of
         patients with mental  illness,  has  also  provided  a  preliminary
         medico-legal report dated 26  March  2015.  That  has  involved  an
         internet and a mobile telephone call, both lasting about one  hour.
         Dr Hartree used a PHQ-9 questionnaire and assessed BF's  depression
         as  severe.  That  was  in  keeping  with  Dr  Hartree's   clinical
         impression. BF did not  appear  to  have  any  constructive  coping
         methods for dealing with her anxieties. Her  symptoms  suggested  a
         possible diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.  She  had
         reported suffering the loss of all her family and having a troubled
         past. Overall, she presented as someone having a  severe  level  of
         mental ill-health, significantly affecting her functioning. Without
         treatment and support it was very likely  that  her  mental  health
         would relapse and deteriorate.

     52. Dr Hartree saw little of RA  in  her  internet  communication  with
         Nigeria. However, she did  have  significant  concerns  about  BF's
         ability to parent RA adequately with her mental health issues.  She
         thought BF was motivated to care for RA and was  trying  her  best,
         but without support and treatment that was insufficient to overcome
         the effects of her depression and psychological distress.  Overall,
         her opinion was that there was a high risk that significant neglect
         of RA  may  occur,  if  she  lost  support  and  failed  to  obtain
         alternative community support, and that  her  mental  health  would
         relapse if she lacked treatment and support.

     53. Thirdly, there is a report from Ms Adeagbo-Sheikh,  an  experienced
         social worker of Nigerian heritage. She spoke to BF and RA via  the
         internet. As regards RA, she reports  that  she  was  not  able  to
         observe the quality of interaction between BF and  RA  but  RA  did
         state that he would like to return to the United Kingdom.  When  he
         was asked if he liked Nigeria he repeatedly stated that he did  not
         like it.

     54. Amnesty International has also prepared a special report as regards
         the current claim. Ordinarily it does not undertake  this  type  of
         exercise but exceptionally has done so in this case.  It  sets  out
         the high cost of housing in Lagos and describes  the  slums  there.
         Abeokuta, Ogun state, does not have the same  population  pressures
         but is also developing slums. It will be extremely difficult for BF
         to find employment and there is the risk for  her  of  prostitution
         and for RA of child labour. Child labour is a  serious  problem  in
         Ogun state. RA will face difficulties in getting access to schools.
         Given BF's serious mental health difficulties she will be  unlikely
         to receive the treatment and support she  needs.  BF  and  RA  face
         substantial risks.

     55. In a second witness statement, Mrs Hayward reports on  the  support
         she has been able to provide to BF and RA from the  United  Kingdom
         by use of contacts both here and in Nigeria. While she had no doubt
         about the love for each other between BF and RA, it  was  clear  to
         her that RA insulated himself emotionally from his mother's sadness
         and distress. She and her husband had already sent another ï¿½700  so
         that the hotel was paid for up to Easter.

     56. Further, the local  authority  has  confirmed  to  the  applicants'
         solicitors that it was never asked by the  Secretary  of  State  to
         comment on whether there were concerns about RA  being  removed  to
         Nigeria with his mother. The local authority adds, however, that at
         the time of removal RA did not have any unmet needs.  If  asked  to
         comment on RA, the local authority would explain  that  he  had  no
         additional needs. The only comment to be made was that RA would  be
         returning to a culture with which he was not  familiar.  The  local
         authority was never in a position to give an informed opinion about
         the likely circumstances the family would face on return.

Statutory and policy framework

     57. Section 82 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
         ("the 2002 Act") sets out the type of decisions which give rise  to
         an appeal. At the relevant time  (between  1  August  2008  and  19
         October 2014 when it was amended) it provided:
             "(1) Where an immigration decision is made  in  respect  of  a
             person he may appeal to the Tribunal.
             (2) In this Part "immigration decision" means-
             (g) a decision that a person is to be removed from the  United
             Kingdom by way of directions under  section  10(1)(a),(b),(ba)
             or (c) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (c.33)  (removal
             of person unlawfully in United Kingdom..."

     58. Section 10(1)(c) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 ("the  1999
         Act") provides that removal directions may be served on the  United
         Kingdom born and non-British citizen children of those  subject  to
         administrative removal under section 10.)

     59. Section 73 of the 2002 Act allows removal directions to be given to
         United Kingdom born children of illegal entrants.

     60. The grounds of appeal in section 84 of the 2002  Act  include  that
         the decision is unlawful under section 6 of the  Human  Rights  Act
         1998 as being incompatible with the appellant's  Convention  rights
         (s. 84(1)( c)) and that the  removal  of  the  appellant  from  the
         United Kingdom in consequence of  the  immigration  decision  would
         breach the our obligations under the Refugee Convention or would be
         unlawful under section 6 of the Human  Rights  Act  1998  as  being
         incompatible with the appellant's Convention rights (s 84(g)).

     61. A person may not appeal under section 82(1)  while  he  is  in  the
         United Kingdom unless his appeal is of a kind to which the  section
         applies: s 92(1). Section 92(4) of  the  2002  Act  applies  to  an
         appeal against an immigration decision if the  appellant  "(a)  has
         made an asylum claim, or a human rights claim, while in the  United
         Kingdom".

     62. Section 113 of the 2002 Act defines an asylum claim as a claim that
         to remove the person from  or  require  him  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom would breach the United  Kingdoms'  obligations  under  the
         Refugee Convention; a human rights claim  means  a  claim  that  to
         remove the person from or require him to leave the  United  Kingdom
         would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

     63. Section 92(4) of the 2002 Act is subject to  section  94(2),  which
         states that the person may not bring an appeal if the Secretary  of
         State certified that  the  claim  or  claims  "is  or  are  clearly
         unfounded".

     64. Whilst an appeal under section 82(1) of the 2002 Act is pending the
         Secretary of State is prohibited from removing the person from  the
         United Kingdom: s. 78 of the 2002 Act.  Section  104  (1)  provides
         that an appeal is pending "during the period (a) beginning when  it
         is instituted  and  (b)  ending  when  it  is  finally  determined,
         withdrawn or abandoned (or when it lapses under section 99.

     65. Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009
         ("section 55 of the Borders Act")  provides  in  material  part  as
         follows:

             "(1)  The  Secretary  of  State  must  make  arrangements  for
             ensuring that -
                  (a)  the  functions  mentioned  in  subsection   (2)   are
                  discharged having regard to  the  need  to  safeguard  and
                  promote the welfare of children  who  are  in  the  United
                  Kingdom, and
                  (b) any services provided by another  person  pursuant  to
                  arrangements which are made by the Secretary of State  and
                  relate  to  the  discharge  of  a  function  mentioned  in
                  subsection (2) are provided having regard to that need.
             (2) The functions referred to in subsection (1) are
                  (a) any function of the Secretary of State in relation  to
                  immigration, asylum or nationality;
             (3) A person  exercising  any  of  those  functions  must,  in
             exercising the function, have regard to any guidance given  to
             the person by the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  purpose  of
             subsection (1).
             (6) In this section-
                  children" means persons who are under the age of 18;
             (7) A reference in an enactment (other than this Act)  to  the
             Immigration Acts includes a reference to this section."

     66. Section 54A of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009
         constitutes  an  independent  family  returns  panel,   which   the
         Secretary of State is to consult in "family return cases".

     67. Section 55 of the Borders Act 2009 was introduced into national law
         in order to reflect the  content  of  Article  3.1  of  the  United
         Nations Convention on the Rights of  the  Child:  ZH  (Tanzania)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 2 AC  166,  [23],
         per Baroness Hale. Article 3.1 reads:

             "In all actions concerning  children,  whether  undertaken  by
             public or private social welfare institutions, courts of  law,
             administrative authorities or  legislative  bodies,  the  best
             interests of the child shall be a primary consideration."

         Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules provides:

             "When a human rights or an asylum claim has  been  refused  or
             withdrawn or treated as  withdrawn  under  paragraph  333C  of
             these Rules and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer
             pending,  the  decision  maker  will  consider   any   further
             submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they
             amount to a fresh claim. The  submissions  will  amount  to  a
             fresh claim if  they  are  significantly  different  from  the
             material which has previously been considered. The submissions
             will only be significantly different if the content:

                  (i) had not already been considered; and

                  (ii)  taken  together  with  the   previously   considered
                  material,  created  a  realistic  prospect   of   success,
                  notwithstanding its rejection."

     68. The Secretary of State's Asylum Policy Guidance on Handling Claims,
         states in respect of the process of identifying  protection  claims
         that if a person expresses an  unwillingness  to  return  to  their
         country of nationality or habitual residence because  they  believe
         they would be in danger, "we should assume that they are attempting
         to  make  an  asylum  claim".  Paragraph  2.1  of   Asylum   Policy
         Instruction: Dependants and Former Dependants provides that  family
         members "can simultaneously remain dependent  on  another  person's
         claim whilst also making a claim in their own right". It adds  that
         if  an  independent  claim  is  made  this   must   be   considered
         individually in accordance with  paragraphs  328  to  333B  of  the
         Immigration Rules". Paragraph 5.1 reads:

             "In the majority of cases, the principal applicant  should  be
             able to provide details of the  asylum  claim  for  the  whole
             family  unit...  However,  caseworkers  must  be  aware   that
             dependants may  raise  issues  independent  of  the  principal
             applicant which may give rise to a protection claim  in  their
             own right... Caseworkers must gather and assess  all  relevant
             information to fully consider  the  protection  needs  of  the
             family  unit  which  may  involve  interviewing  one  or  more
             dependants. Where necessary and bearing in mind  the  need  to
             consider the best interests of  the  child  to  avoid  putting
             children through an interview unnecessarily, where  the  child
             is of an appropriate age, caseworkers should consider  whether
             hearing from the child is necessary."

     69. The Asylum Policy Instruction: Processing  Family  Cases  (1  March
         2011) provides:

             "1.4 Involving children in decisions that impact on them

             "[The Secretary of State] should  not  assume  that  the  best
             interests of a child, on  the  one  hand,  and  those  of  its
             parents (or any other adult with parental  responsibility  for
             the child), on the  other,  will  be  the  same.  Where  those
             interests are not aligned, appropriate steps must be taken  to
             elicit and assess the child's views, as well as those  of  the
             parent(s) or any other adult with parental responsibility  for
             the child."

Issue 1: Does RA have a separate claim?

     70. The first issue is whether RA made  a  separate  asylum  and  human
         rights claim apart from his mother and therefore had  a  suspensive
         in country right of appeal in accordance with section 92(4) of  the
         2002 Act.

     71. Ms Harrison QC advanced the argument that RA had a separate  asylum
         and human rights claim firstly as a matter of principle. There  is,
         she submitted, strong authority that what constitutes  a  claim  in
         section 113 of the 2002 Act is not  to  be  construed  narrowly  or
         technically: R v Uxbridge Magistrates Court ex parte  Adimi  [2001]
         QB 667. Moreover, there are no  written  procedures  or  prescribed
         application forms for asylum or human rights claims. There is  also
         the  Secretary  of  State's  own  policy,  quoted  earlier  in  the
         judgement, which recognises that a purposive approach is  required;
         that a family member can simultaneously remain dependent on another
         person's claim, while also making a claim in their own  right;  and
         that case workers need to be sensitive to where independent  claims
         are  being  made.  Importantly,  under  the  Secretary  of  State's
         guidance she must be astute when immigration decisions  affect  the
         rights and interests of children to ensure that their  position  is
         separately and distinctly considered from that of adults: see  also
         SS (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2012]
         EWCA Civ 945, [17]. In the circumstances of this case, Ms  Harrison
         submitted, the Secretary of State should have recognized  that  the
         solicitors were advancing a separate claim on behalf of RA  and  on
         the facts his separate treatment was demanded.

     72. Acting pro bono for the Office of the Children's  Commissioner,  Ms
         Gallafent QC reminded us that a child may be at  risk  of  harm  on
         return, contrary to the Refugee Convention,  or  to  Article  3  or
         Article 8 the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  ("ECHR")  in
         circumstances where a comparably placed adult would not be at risk.
         For example a child might be at risk of a form  of  harm  that  can
         only be inflicted on a child such  as  pre-puberty  female  genital
         cutting,  or  a  child  may  apprehend  a  level  of  physical   or
         psychological harm which would not reach the requisite threshold in
         the case of an adult: see R (SQ (Pakistan)) v Upper Tribunal [2013]
         EWCA  Civ  1251,  [17].  Secondly,  Ms   Gallafent   made   helpful
         submissions  about  what  has  been  termed  the  invisibility   of
         accompanied children: despite the fact that  a  child  may  have  a
         stronger independent asylum or human rights claim  than  an  adult,
         their claim is overlooked and treated as inseparable from  that  of
         an accompanying family member.

     73. Mindful of these considerations  we  accept  that,  notwithstanding
         that no separate claim may be expressly advanced  on  behalf  of  a
         child, the circumstances may be  such  as  to  warrant  independent
         treatment. Whether the Secretary of State must identify a  separate
         claim will be fact sensitive. There may be  a  clear,  and  obvious
         conflict between the interests of a parent  and  child  to  justify
         separate treatment. But that will be very unusual. Just because the
         interests within a family diverge does  not  mean  that  the  child
         should be treated as having advanced a separate claim.  Differences
         in matters such as the prospect of success  of  family  members  if
         they claimed separately can be accommodated within the  one  claim.
         Moreover, the child's interests will be protected as a result of  a
         best interests inquiry through the operation of section 55  of  the
         Borders Act.

     74. The issue on judicial review  is  whether,  on  the  facts  of  the
         particular case, the Secretary of State can be said to be in  error
         in not treating a child in a family application as having  advanced
         a separate claim. We put  the  matter  that  way,  and  not  as  Ms
         Harrison submitted, that the question is one of precedent fact.  No
         authority was advanced to support  that  proposition;  indeed  such
         authority, as it exists, is against it: see Green J's review of the
         authorities in R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of  State
         for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 2494 (Admin); [2015] 1 All E.R.
         1057, at [70].

     75. In our judgment BF's then  solicitors  could  not  be  said  to  be
         advancing a separate claim for RA  in  the  annual  representations
         beginning in 2012, nor was the Secretary of State in error  in  not
         treating RA as having made a separate claim. The representations in
         2012 and 2013 mentioned RA, as a child born here for  whom  removal
         to Nigeria would be detrimental to his development,  who  would  be
         subject to risks in Nigeria and who had a  private  life  here.  In
         relation to Article 8, and the  best  interests  of  her  son,  the
         Secretary of State's response was that RA was in BF's care, she was
         fulfilling  all  his  fundamental  needs  and  it  had   not   been
         demonstrated that it would be unreasonable for them to return as  a
         family unit.

     76. That approach was in line with the  decision  of  Azimi-Moayed  and
         others (decisions affecting children;  onward  appeals)  [2013]UKUT
         197(where the Upper Tribunal held that the length of residence  was
         an important factor and observed that seven years from the age four
         is likely to be more significant to a child than  the  first  seven
         years of life and that very young children are  focussed  on  their
         parents rather than their peers and are adaptable), and E-appellant
         (Article 8-best interests of  a  child)  Nigeria  [2011]UKUT  00315
         (where the Tribunal stated  that  during  the  child's  very  early
         years, he or she will be primarily focused on self and  the  caring
         parent or guardian). By no stretch of the imagination  could  these
         representations be interpreted as advancing a separate claim for RA
         or that a separate treatment of RA was justified.

     77. The representations of 19 March 2014  repeated  much  of  what  was
         contained  in  the  18  March  2013  letter.  As  regards  RA,  the
         representations made reference to him as "a dependent on her [BF's]
         asylum claim" and  the  representations  repeated  the  point  that
         removal would be detrimental to his development with a reference to
         his best interests. Nothing was said about what had happened to the
         family over the preceding year and no point  was  taken  about  how
         this might affect the position. On the face of  the  letter,  there
         was  no  suggestion  that  those  events  had  any  relevance.  The
         Secretary of State did not reply  immediately,  no  doubt  in  part
         because she had decided to take no  action  until  the  Supervision
         Order in relation to RA had run its course. By this time,  she  had
         had periodic updates about the family. When she  did  reply  on  25
         September 2014, she treated the 19 March representations  as  being
         made on behalf of BF and RA. There was also some discussion of RA's
         best interests, as we have described earlier. A  challenge  to  the
         decision in the letter is well out of time so there is no need  for
         us to canvas what legal avenues the solicitors  could  have  taken.
         What we can say is that at this point there  was  no  flaw  in  the
         Secretary of State's approach in considering RA' claim  along  with
         his mother's.

     78. There were then the eleventh hour representations in  January  2015
         when BF and RA were about to be removed. Again, there  is  no  need
         for us to explore what legal avenues were available but not pursued
         by BF's then solicitors as regards removal. The representations  of
         22 January  2015  focused  on  BF's  claims  with  mention  of  the
         implications for RA. For the first time, RA's foster care  in  2013
         was mentioned and it was suggested (drawing  on  the  GP's  letter)
         that return would exacerbate BF's mental  health  issues  'and  the
         child would need to be in a secure  and  comfortable  environment'.
         That is hardly the language of a separate claim for BA. The  letter
         of the following day did not take the matter further.

     79. By this time, the Secretary of State had a  wealth  of  information
         about the family including the Child in Need assessments. But there
         was also the advice to the Independent Family Return  Panel  on  16
         December 2014, from its experienced chair, that the local authority
         would not be prepared to let them go if there was anything  further
         they could do for them.  (After  the  meeting  of  the  Panel,  the
         information was sent to the local authority  which  did  not  raise
         concerns.) Importantly, there  was  the  positive  summary  of  the
         position by the social worker, Zoey Hughes.  In  the  Secretary  of
         State's replies she referred to Ms Hughes' assessment and concluded
         that the 'lovely and warm relationship' between BF and RA which  Ms
         Hughes had identified was unlikely to  change  after  removal.  The
         Secretary of State acknowledged BF's mental health  issues  and  Dr
         Rana's opinion about its exacerbation in Nigeria but did not accept
         that BF had no friends or family in Nigeria to assist. Against that
         background, we cannot conclude that the Secretary  of  State  acted
         irrationally  or  otherwise  unlawfully   in   not   treating   the
         representations as advancing a separate claim for RA. The interests
         of BF and RA were different but not in conflict. In  our  judgement
         at no point on the facts of this case did the  Secretary  of  State
         err in treating RA's claim as running together with  those  of  his
         mother.

Issue 2: Does RA have a separate in country right of appeal?

     80. Since we have  concluded  that  there  was  no  error  because  the
         Secretary of State did not treat RA as having made a separate claim
         on asylum or human rights grounds for BF,  he  has  no  in  country
         right of appeal. The only appealable decision with regard to RA  is
         the section 10 decision made in 2010, which carries only an out  of
         country appeal. No other immigration decision within the meaning of
         section 82 of the 2002 Act  has  been  taken  as  regards  him.  Ms
         Harrison canvassed the legal  and  practical  disadvantages  of  RA
         having an out of country right of  appeal.  However  purposive  the
         approach to construing the legislation, and however crucial is  the
         principal of access to justice, the  legislation  simply  does  not
         give RA an in country appeal.

     81. We would offer two comments. First, in an out of country appeal, RA
         will still be able to challenge his removal on the grounds, broadly
         stated, that the decision is unlawful under section 6 of the  Human
         Rights Act 1998; that the decision was not in accordance  with  the
         Immigration Rules or is not in accordance with the law; and that in
         taking the decision, the Secretary of State should  have  exercised
         her discretion under the Immigration Rules  differently.  Secondly,
         the grounds of appeal ably drafted by Ms  Cronin  for  the  out  of
         country appeal cover the essentials of RA's  complaints  about  his
         removal. The Secretary of State accepted before  us  that  material
         after 2010 would be usable in RA's out of country appeal.

Issue 3: Fresh claim and best interests

     82. Ms Harrison's alternative submission was that RA's asylum and human
         rights claims should have been accepted as giving rise to  a  fresh
         claim in his own right or as part of BF's fresh claim. Since RA has
         never made a claim, we cannot see how he  can  have  made  a  fresh
         claim. Rather, the issue in our view is whether in considering  the
         January 2015 representations advanced by BF's then solicitors,  the
         Secretary of State rationally concluded that RA's asylum and  human
         rights representations did not  give  rise  to  a  fresh  claim  as
         advanced by BF.

     83. There is no dispute as to the correct approach to be  adopted  when
         dealing with an application under paragraph 353 of the  Immigration
         Rules. It is set out in the judgment of Buxton  LJ  in  R  (on  the
         application  of  WM(DRC)  v  Secretary  of  State  for   the   Home
         Department[2006] EWCA Civ 1495, [6]-[11]. The  Secretary  of  State
         has  to  consider  whether  there  is   new   material   which   is
         significantly different from that already  submitted,  and  if  so,
         whether that material, taken together with the  previous  material,
         creates a realistic prospect of success  in  a  further  claim.  In
         doing so, the Secretary  of  State  must  be  informed  by  anxious
         scrutiny of the material.

     84. Ms Rhee submitted that in refusing to treat BF's representations as
         a fresh claim, the Secretary of State properly considered the  best
         interests of her son, RA, pursuant to section  55  of  the  Borders
         Act.  At  all  times  she  considered  RA's   interests   lawfully,
         reasonably and sensitive to his needs.  The  Secretary  of  State's
         contacts with the local authority and RA's school  illustrated  her
         careful and proactive approach to discharging  her  best  interests
         duty, consistent with her guidance and SS (Sri Lanka)  v  Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 945,  [17].  Those
         contacts  informed  her  relevant  decision  making.  Further,  she
         postponed removal until the Supervision Order  was  discharged  and
         until, at  the  last  care  meeting,  there  were  no  safeguarding
         concerns. The Office of the Children's Champion was  involved.  The
         Independent Family Return Panel carefully considered the  mechanics
         of return but  against  the  broader  background.  BF  had  refused
         Assisted Voluntary Return which would have meant more financial and
         other assistance on return, but exceptionally BF was provided  with
         ï¿½500 as well as the resource pack. When  the  money  could  not  be
         accessed, the British High Commission in Nigeria provided  ï¿½350  in
         cash. In Ms Rhee's submission, a diagnosis  of  depression  with  a
         parent does not per se demonstrate a threat to a child's welfare.

     85. Notwithstanding all this we have concluded that  the  Secretary  of
         State's decisions of 22 and 23 January of this year do not evidence
         the regard to the best interests of RA as a primary  consideration.
         We acknowledge that the representations which for  the  first  time
         raised the issue of the potential risks for RA associated with BF's
         mental health arrived on the very eve of his intended removal along
         with the mother. We also acknowledge that the  Secretary  of  State
         drew on Zoey Hughes' conclusion that BF and RA  had  a  lovely  and
         warm relationship. However, the Secretary of  State's  letters  did
         not address the risks associated with any decline  of  BF's  mental
         health for RA's future in Nigeria. The local  authority  had  never
         been asked to address those risks and would  not  necessarily  have
         had the expertise to do so if it had been.

     86. There can be no challenge to the Secretary of State's  reasons  for
         rejecting the representations as a fresh claim as regards BF on her
         own. In  ordinary  circumstances  that  would  be  conclusive  with
         respect to RA's interests as  well:  young  children  like  RA  are
         removable with their parents and their best interests are served by
         being with them. But in the special circumstances of this case,  in
         not taking into account the implications of BF's mental health  for
         RA, and the risk of that degenerating in the Nigerian context,  and
         the likely consequences on removal, the Secretary of  State  failed
         to have regard to RA's best interests as a  primary  consideration.
         We do not consider that the  Secretary  of  State  discharged  that
         duty. By failing to take into account the matters we have set  out,
         we have concluded that the Secretary of State  did  not  take  into
         account  material  considerations  and  thus  did  not  employ  the
         requisite anxious scrutiny required. Thus  the  decision  that  the
         representations did not demonstrate a realistic prospect of success
         before an immigration judge was in our judgment flawed.

Conclusion

     87. For the reasons we have given we grant judicial review.
