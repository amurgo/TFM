                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Hawden-Beal, promulgated on 15 June 2016,  dismissing  the
         Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's  decision   of   21
         September 2015 refusing his protection claim.



   Background


      2. The Appellant is a national of Gambia, born on 18 February 1987. He
         first entered the UK on 20 July 2011 as the dependent partner of a
         Tier 4 Student. His entry clearance was valid until 22 June 2013.
         He formally claimed asylum on 23 March 2015. Although he had not
         been involved in any political activities in Gambia he claimed to
         have engaged in sur place political activities in the UK rendering
         him at risk of persecution from the Gambian authorities.


      3. The asylum claim was refused by the Respondent. The Respondent did
         not accept that the Appellant was of interest to the Gambian
         authorities. The Respondent noted that the Appellant had married an
         ardent supporter of the Gambian regime who was working for the
         government. The Respondent was not satisfied that the Appellant
         sufficiently explained why he suddenly became politically active.
         The Respondent accepted that the Appellant attended protests in the
         UK and that he posted an online article critical of the Gambian
         government that contained his photograph on a website known to be
         observed by the Gambian authorities. There was said to be no
         evidence as to why the Appellant felt compelled to post a prominent
         picture of himself instead of writing his comment anonymously. The
         Respondent did not find it credible that the Appellant would
         voluntarily expose himself to an unnecessary fatal risk whilst
         being aware of the repercussions from the Gambian authorities for
         speaking out against the government. As such, the Respondent
         believed the Appellant publish the article in bad faith.


      4. The Respondent referred to pictures of the Appellant found the
         "Kibaaro" and "Gainako" websites but these were said to have been
         taken in the long- shot and it was not possible to identify him as
         one of the group. Although the Respondent noted there were
         photographs of the Appellant holding up anti-regime placards in
         what appeared to be a European capital, there was no evidence to
         show that these were actually taken at the protests he mentioned.
         The Respondent noted that nothing had happened to the Appellant's
         brother in Gambia, who was said to be a police officer, and that
         there was no evidence that his family members had been targeted as
         a result of the publication of the article. The Respondent
         concluded that the Appellant had no political profile in Gambia and
         that he would be able to return without any reasonable likelihood
         of risk of persecution.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      5. The Appellant gave evidence before the first-tier Tribunal in
         English. His appeal was supported by a bundle of documents running
         to 231 pages. This included stills from YouTube videos in which he
         could be seen, the article entitled "Jammeh Must Go" (Mr Yahya
         Jammeh being the president of Gambia) which was published online on
         20 August 2014, general background reports relating to political
         dissent in Gambia published by, inter alia, Amnesty International,
         news reports from the BBC and Reuters, and the Respondent's
         Operational Guidance Note (OGN) on Gambia dated January 2014, and
         the December 2015 Country Information and Guidance report (CIG)
         'Gambia: opposition to the government'.


      6. The judge recorded the evidence given by the Appellant. The
         Appellant confirmed that he had not been interested or involved in
         politics in Gambia and that it was only when he arrived in the UK,
         following the execution of 9 death-row inmates in Gambia, that he
         became politically aware. This political awareness grew following
         the withdrawal by Gambia from the Commonwealth in 2014. The
         Appellant's wife was a strong supporter of the Gambian president
         and they had a fight that eventually led to their separation. She
         returned to Gambia with their daughter, who was born in 2012, and
         was said to be the financial attach� to the Gambian embassy in
         Spain.


      7. The Appellant claims his ex-wife threatened to report his political
         opposition to the Gambian government. The Appellant did not however
         know whether she had done so. The Appellant claimed that, following
         a failed coup attempt at the end of 2014, his cousin, who was in
         the army, died. The Appellant said that he submitted his photograph
         with his published article because he had the freedom to do so in
         the UK and he wanted the community to be aware of what was
         happening. He believed the Gambian authorities would read the
         article because no one in Gambia could publish it as the media was
         controlled by the president and his tribe. The Appellant said he
         knew a law had been passed banning anyone criticising the
         government or taking part in demonstrations. The Appellant gave
         details of his attendance at demonstrations in the UK - two in
         April 2014, one in July 2014, one in January 2015, one in February
         2016 and one in April 2016.


      8. The judge accepted that the background evidence showed the Gambian
         authorities intolerant of any criticism either from those in Gambia
         or those outside the country. The judge stated that the question
         she had to decide was whether the Appellant's sur place activities
         in the UK 'since December 2014' were such that he would be known to
         or identified by the Gambian authorities as a 'bad element' or
         someone who had portrayed Gambia in a 'negative light' [25]. It is
         curious that the judge restricted her consideration of the sur
         place activities to December 2014 when the online article pivotal
         to the Appellant's claim was posted on 20 August 2014.


      9. The judge accepted that the Appellant wrote an article published
         online in August 2014 calling for the overthrow of the president
         [26]. The judge found that the article had been read 1205 times and
         not the 3000 times as claimed by the Appellant in his interview,
         but found that reference to calls for the armed forces to overthrow
         the president 'by any means necessary' had to include violent
         means. The judge considered the photographs provided by the
         Appellant relating to his claimed attendance at demonstrations in
         the UK but found some of them to be of poor quality making it
         difficult to identify the Appellant. The judge additionally made
         reference to screenshots of a YouTube video of a demonstration in
         London in July 2014. It is apparent that the judge did not look at
         the YouTube video herself and the screenshots were said to be very
         dark preventing the judge from being able to identify the
         Appellant. The Appellant was not named in the published articles
         concerning the demonstrations.


     10. The judge indicated that she considered BA (Demonstrators in
         Britain - risk on return) Iran CG [2011] UKUT 36 (IAC) and had
         applied the guidelines contained therein. The judge found that the
         Appellant was merely a member of the crowd in all of the 5
         demonstrations. There was said to be no evidence that he addressed
         the crowd or lead the chanting although it was apparent that he
         held a placard in one of the 2006 demonstrations. The judge did not
         consider that the Appellant was a regular participant at the
         demonstrations. There was said to be no independent evidence that
         the demonstrations reached the Gambian population given that only
         13 to 14% of the population had access to the Internet and given
         that the media was controlled by the government. The judge was not
         satisfied that the demonstrations were viewed online in Gambia or
         listened to via radio station broadcasts. The judge found that the
         YouTube coverage of the various demonstrations only had a limited
         number of views (ranging from 9,200 to 5,600). There was said to be
         no evidence that the YouTube postings had been seen by the Gambian
         authorities, or that there was any evidence that the Gambian
         authorities had been filming or recording the demonstrations.


     11. At [31] the judge stated, "... the evidence from the OGN of 2014 at
         paragraph 3.17.15 states that only 12 Gambians living abroad in a
         variety of countries, including the UK, was subject to possible
         surveillance by the security forces. This could either indicate
         that only 12 people at that stage were of interest to the
         government or that they only had the capacity to subject to these
         12 to surveillance. Whichever it is, 12 is an extremely small
         number, given the number of Gambians known to be living outside of
         their home country." Although she referred to an article at page 56
         of the Appellant's bundle concerning a member of the Gambian
         Embassy in Senegal caught filming a demonstration, the judge was
         not consequently satisfied that the demonstrations in the UK reach
         the Gambian population or that they were filmed by the regime. The
         judge also stated that there was no evidence to indicate that the
         Gambian authorities had access to facial recognition technology
         sufficient for them to be able to identify the Appellant.


     12. At [32] the judge stated, "I take account of the publication of his
         article in December 2014 and the fact that his photograph was also
         attached to the publication but I find that that is insufficient
         evidence to say that this would have attracted the attention of the
         Gambian authorities."


     13. Citing his lack of any involvement in politics in Gambia and his
         former marriage to the financial attach� to the Gambian embassy in
         Spain the judge was not satisfied the Appellant was a committed
         opponent of the Gambian government. The judge did not accept that
         the Appellant and his wife separated as a result of a difference of
         political opinion and there was said to be no evidence that she had
         carried out her alleged threat of informing the government of his
         political opposition. Having noted that the Appellant's family
         still lived in Gambia, and in the absence of any evidence to show
         that they had been arrested, detained, questioned or ill-treated as
         a result of his activities in the UK, the judge concluded that the
         sur place activities undertaken by the Appellant would not bring
         him to the adverse attention of the Gambian authorities.

The grounds of appeal

     14. The grounds contend that the judge failed to give adequate reasons
         for concluding that the publication of the Appellant's online
         article would not bring him to the adverse attention of the Gambian
         authorities. It was submitted that the judge failed to take into
         account material evidence indicating that online papers were
         accessible to the public in Gambia, and that the Gambian government
         constantly monitored those online papers. It was further submitted
         that the judge inaccurately quoted from the OGN of 2014 as the
         adjective 'only' did not appear in the document and that this
         materially altered the meaning she ascribed to the extract. It was
         further submitted that the judge failed to take into account
         background evidence suggesting that the Gambian authorities might
         video or photograph those in demonstrations and legal authority
         relating to the likelihood of such filming (TM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD
         [2010] EWCA Civ 916.

Discussion

     15. Following submissions from both representatives I indicated that I
         was satisfied that the judge materially erred in law by failing to
         take account of the evidence before her indicating  that the
         Gambian authorities do monitor and block websites critical of the
         government, and, in light of this evidence, by giving inadequate
         reasons for concluding that the online article published on 20
         August 2014 would not have come to the attention of the
         authorities.


     16. The article was published on a website that the Respondent herself,
         in her Reasons For Refusal Letter, noted was an "online site known
         to you to be observed by the GMB authorities." Neither in the
         Reasons For Refusal Letter, nor at the hearing before the First-
         tier Tribunal, nor indeed at the Upper Tribunal hearing before me,
         has the Respondent ever challenged the legitimacy of the
         'kibaaro.com' website. Although there is a slight discrepancy
         between the article as it appeared in the Respondent's bundle
         (which indicated that it had been read 3356 times) and the article
         as it appeared in the Appellant's bundle (which indicated it had
         been read 1205 times), there has never been any suggestion that it
         was not published online and this was, in any event, accepted by
         the judge. The website was, prima facie, genuine and legitimate,
         and hosted comments and articles that were critical of the current
         Gambian government. The article itself clearly indicated that it
         was written by the Appellant and was accompanied by a prominent
         photograph of him. The article was highly critical of the Gambian
         president. It stated that the president had lost the legitimacy to
         rule Gambia and criticised government attacks on demonstrators. It
         claimed that the Gambian authorities committed unlawful arrests,
         undertook false prosecutions, committed 'brutal killings' and
         torture. It referred to the current regime is being 'dictatorial
         and brutal'. It called for the president to be relinquished of
         power "by all means necessary".


     17. The judge herself noted that the Gambian authorities did not
         tolerate any criticism of those from inside and outside Gambia
         [25]. There was before the judge a copy of the December 2015 CIG
         report on Gambia. This stated, at 4.1.7,


          The USSD also noted: 'There were numerous reports of politically
          motivated disappearances during the year. A number of persons were
          reported missing after being arrested by the National Intelligence
          Agency (NIA)... Observers believed the government monitored
          citizens engaged in activities that it deemed objectionable...
          Individuals who publicly or privately criticized the government or
          the president risked government reprisal... The constitution and
          law provide for freedom of assembly; however, police
          systematically refused requests for permission to hold
          demonstrations, including peaceful ones, and occasionally refused
          to issue permits to opposition parties wishing to hold political
          rallies.'


     18. 5.1.1 of the same report stated:


          In July 2013, the National Assembly passed the Information and
          Communication (Amendment) Act, allowing for penalties of up to 15
          years' imprisonment and hefty fines for offences including:
          criticizing government officials online; spreading "false news"
          about the government or public officials; making derogatory
          statements against public officials; and inciting dissatisfaction
          or instigating violence against the government.


     19. 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 of the same report read:
          Freedom House's Press Freedom report of 2014, published 1 December
          2014, stated: 'About 14 percent of the population had access to
          the internet in 2013. The Gambia's media landscape includes a
          substantial number of online news sites and blogs, many of which
          are based overseas and operated by Gambian expatriates, among them
          exiled journalists. Government restrictions on the internet
          include blocking websites that are critical of the government,
          which limits the diversity of information and viewpoints available
          to the country's residents, as well as other information-sharing
          applications.'
          'There were few government restrictions on access to the internet
          or credible reports that the government monitored private online
          communications without judicial oversight. Internet users,
          however, reported they could not access the websites of foreign
          online news blogs such as Freedom Online and occasionally other
          domestic dissident blogs.

     20. This background material indicated that the Gambian government did
         place restrictions on the Internet that included the blocking of
         websites that were critical of the government. Logically the
         Gambian authorities would need to monitor such websites first. The
         passing of the Information and Communication (Amendment) Act in
         2013 highlighted the government's concern with online criticism.
         Having regard to these reports I am satisfied that there was a
         strong evidential basis to support the Appellant's claim that the
         publication of his article online was, on the lower standard of
         proof, likely come to the adverse attention of the authorities. The
         failure by the judge to properly engage with the background
         material or to offer any satisfactory reason to support her
         conclusion constitutes a material error of law.

     21. I am satisfied that the above error is sufficient to render the
         judge's decision unsafe. Any finding by the judge that the
         Appellant published the article in bad faith does not eradicate the
         risk of harm that he may face from the Gambian authorities. This
         much was recognised by Mr Bramble and is reflect in a range of
         authorities dating back to Danian v Secretary of State for the Home
         Department [1999] EWCA Civ 3000 and, more recently, in YB (Eritrea)
         v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 360.


     22. I am additionally concerned that the judge's inaccurate reference
         to 3.17.15 of the January 2014 OGN, in which she added the word
         "only", rendered unreliable her assessment of the likelihood of the
         demonstrations attended by the Appellant in the UK being monitored.


     23. The relevant extracts reads:


          Those perceived as political opponents of the Government are also
          subject to threats and monitoring while living outside of the
          country. For example, in January 2011, Gambia's Justice Minister,
          Edward Gomez, noted that any Gambian dissident who portrayed the
          country in a negative light while abroad would be prosecuted
          should they return home. He stated that "These are unfortunately
          evil members of The Gambian society who took refuge abroad putting
          every nonsensical story on papers and on radios to tarnish the
          good image of The Gambia government," and that "We will wait here
          for them to come". Furthermore, Amnesty International has obtained
          a copy of a letter which appears to have been sent by the Gambian
          Police Force in February 2013 to the heads of all the security
          forces and which orders the surveillance of 12 Gambians living
          abroad in a variety of countries, including the UK.


     24. The addition of the adjective 'only' before '12' suggests either
         that only 12 individuals had been targeted by the Gambian
         government for surveillance, or that the government only had the
         resources to target 12 individuals. This is clearly stated by the
         judge at [31]. The extract however indicates no such restriction.
         It merely states that, in a particular letter, 12 individuals had
         been targeted. By misreading the extract the judge has failed to
         properly consider the background material relating to the
         likelihood of surveillance of anti-government activities outside
         Gambia. In my judgement this is a further factor rendering the
         judge's decision unsafe.


    Remaking the appeal


     25. With the consent of both representatives, and having identified
         material errors of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,
         I proceeded to hear further submissions from both parties in order
         to remake the decision. Both representatives agreed that I could
         watch the YouTube videos from which the screen still is contained
         in the Appellant's bundle were extracted.


     26. I have considered the YouTube video published on 23 July 2014. This
         does show clearly the Appellant at a demonstration in London. The
         Appellant can also be seen in a further video, published on 23
         February 2016, holding a placard critical of the Gambian
         authorities. In a further video, published on 27 April 2016, the
         Appellant is clearly seen on several occasions wearing a T-shirt
         critical of the regime and holding a loudspeaker and leading
         chants. The last 2 videos were published by VoxAfrica, a pan-
         African satellite TV channel.


     27. It is clear from the CIG and OGN extracts refer to above that there
         is a considerable amount of suppression of political opponents, or
         perceived political opponents, in Gambia. Given the background
         evidence that the government monitors and, on occasion, blocks
         websites critical of the government, I am satisfied, on the lower
         standard of proof, that there is a real risk that the Gambian
         authorities would have become aware of the highly critical article
         published by the Appellant on the kibaaro.com website. I have
         considered the possibility that the Gambian authorities may
         consider or be persuaded that the Appellant's activity was
         opportunistic and insincere. Given the nature of the article, which
         is extreme and calls for the overthrow of the government, I do not
         regard this as a realistic possibility. Therefore, on the basis of
         the published article alone, I am persuaded that the Appellant
         would face a real risk of persecution if removed to Gambia.


     28. I am however reinforced in my conclusion by reference to the
         relatively prominent role played by the Appellant in at least 3
         protests that are recorded on YouTube, each of which has been
         viewed several thousand times. Given that this website is publicly
         accessible there exists, again on the lower standard of proof, a
         real risk that the videos could have been seen by the Gambian
         government. The Appellant's photograph and name were prominent in
         the article published in August 2014. The fact that the Appellant
         held placards, wore a shirt with slogans critical of the
         government, and used a loudspeaker to lead anti-government chants
         is likely to reinforce any perception held by the Gambian
         authorities that the Appellant is a person holding views critical
         of the government.


     29. For the above reasons I am satisfied that the Appellant has
         discharged the burden of proving that he faces a real risk of
         persecution if removed to Gambia.


Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made a material  error  of  law.  I  remake  of  the
decision allowing the Appellant's asylum claim.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any member of his family. This direction  applies
both to the Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure to  comply  with  this
direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
