                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Farrelly, promulgated on 7 February 2017.   His  grounds  may  be
    summarised as follows.

      Error when assessing internal relocation.

      (1) The FtT erred at �30 as there was no or insufficient evidence that
      the Kurdish authorities had pre-cleared the appellant: AA [2015]  UKUT
      00544 headnote 17 and �150.  If  the  appellant  does  not  have  pre-
      clearance he would have to exercise internal  flight  to  Baghdad:  AK
      [2007] Imm AR 81.  The FtT made no assessment of factors  relevant  to
      reasonability of such  relocation.   The  appellant  has  no  ties  in
      Baghdad, is Sunni, and faces the risk of kidnapping.

      (2) The FtT also erred when finding that the appellant could fly  from
      Baghdad to Erbil.  He would not be able to as he would be returned  on
      a laissez passer valid for only one journey, which would be taken from
      him on return, and would have no documentation to fly from Baghdad  to
      Erbil: AA at �25.  The FtT  reached  findings  not  supported  by  the
      evidence, or failed to exercise anxious scrutiny.

Submissions for appellant.

 2. The grant of permission was on ground (2) only.  The appellant did  not
    seek to advance ground (1).

 3. The appellant's position was that he had no documents.  The  ground  of
    appeal should be read under deletion of reference to a laissez  passer.
    The case should have been decided on the basis that the appellant would
    have no document enabling him to travel from Baghdad to Erbil.

 4. In that respect, the appellant relied on the observation of  the  judge
    granting  permission,  "The  reasonable  prospect  of   the   appellant
    travelling from Baghdad to another part of Iraq (including Erbil) would
    have afforded the appellant a safe outcome but,  arguably,  had  to  be
    considered in terms of whether there was a realistic prospect  of  this
    being achieved in practice; route, method of transport, cost etc.".

 5. The judge did not at paragraph 28 or elsewhere in the decision  make  a
    finding on whether the appellant has any documents.  At  paragraph  30,
    there was a failure to reach a conclusion on his position  assuming  he
    has no documents. The country guidance imposed a requirement to look at
    the practicalities of travel.

 6. The judge appeared at paragraph 11 and elsewhere to approach  the  case
    as if the appellant's  account  of  events  was  accepted.  That  might
    explain the lack of a specific finding. If that had  been  the  judge's
    view, he should have allowed the appeal on the basis that the appellant
    would have no documents, had no family connections  to  enable  him  to
    replace them, and would be unable to access the IKR.

 7. Alternatively, if the judge failed to reach a finding  on  whether  the
    appellant could relocate in Baghdad, a fresh decision should be reached
    by reassessing that option. There being no basis for  finding  that  he
    had the ability to obtain a document or the assistance of  his  family,
    that point should be resolved in his favour, and the appeal  should  be
    allowed.

 8. As a further alternative, if it were thought that the  error  could  be
    resolved only by further findings after fresh hearing of the  evidence,
    the case should be remitted to the FtT.

Submissions for respondent.

 9. Paragraphs 28 - 30 were plainly to the effect that the appellant  could
    be returned to Iraq by way of Baghdad and could relocate in the IKR. At
    the end of paragraph 30, the judge said, "He could reasonably relocate,
    [most] likely to the  IKR"  [typographical  correction  agreed  by  the
    parties].  That  was  a  finding  that  he  would  have  the  means  of
    travelling on. That derived from the narration at paragraph 27: country
    guidance indicated that although not removable directly to the IKR, not
    being from that area, the appellant could travel  there  from  Baghdad,
    supported by AA at paragraphs 24 and 171, to both of  which  the  judge
    referred.

10. It was for the appellant to make his case, and he had  not  established
    that there would be any difficulty in taking a flight from  Baghdad  to
    Erbil. There are been nothing drawn to the judge's attention to suggest
    any difficulty in that respect. Essentially he now sought  to  argue  a
    point which had not been put to the FtT. In any event, it was not shown
    to have any substance.

Response for appellant.

11. The obligation was not on the appellant  to  establish  his  case  but,
    unusually, in this respect on the SSHD, based on AA at paragraph 170.

12. The appellant said in his witness statement at paragraph 14 that he did
    not have identity documents when he came to the  UK.  It  was  accepted
    that his evidence was ambivalent as to  whether  he  had  documents  in
    Iraq, and  that  it  might  be  implied  that  he  did.  The  issue  of
    practicality of return had been before  the  judge,  as  had  been  the
    availability of assistance of friends and family. The judge noted these
    matters but reached no decision. It was not apparent from the  decision
    that the judge had appreciated that ability  to  board  a  flight  from
    Baghdad to Erbil might be a relevant issue.  This was not  the  raising
    of a new point after the hearing.

13. Even if this was a new  point,  the  matter  was  important  enough  to
    deserve being admitted in the discretion of the court, or as an obvious
    issue.

Discussion and conclusions.

14. The appellant relies heavily on parts of two paragraphs in AA:

      25.  Dr Fatah ... did not think that the laissez passer  used  ...  to
      return from the UK ... could be used for an onward trip  to  the  IKR.
      The laisser passer is a document valid for one trip and likely  to  be
      taken by the authorities on arrival in Baghdad.

      170. ... If the position is that the Secretary of State  can  feasibly
      remove an Iraqi national, then  she  will  be  expected  to  tell  the
      tribunal whether and if  so  what  documentation  has  led  the  Iraqi
      authorities to issue the national with passport or laissez passer  (or
      signal their intention to do so). The tribunal will need to  know,  in
      particular, where the person concerned has a CSID. It  is  only  where
      return is feasible but the individual concerned does not have  a  CSID
      that the consequences of not having one come into play.

15. The appellant seeks to place more weight on those  passages  than  they
    properly bear.

16. Paragraph 25 comes from narration of evidence, not from conclusions.

17. The nature of a laissez passer is  that  it  is  issued  by  the  Iraqi
    authorities in the UK for the return of a national.  The appellant does
    not refer to any evidence that it is  a  document  relevant  to  travel
    within Iraq, nor  to  any  evidence  about  documentation  required  by
    providers of travel within Iraq.  The passage of evidence does not bear
    the construction that if a laissez passer is taken from  an  appellant,
    that bars onward travel.

18. Paragraph 170 comes within the discussion of internal  relocation.   It
    is framed in terms of what a tribunal may expect from the SSHD,  but  I
    find that it does not support this appeal, for three reasons:

    (1) The terms of the paragraph  do  not  reach  quite  so  far  as  the
    appellant contends.  If there is any obligation on the SSHD  then  even
    at highest she does not have to prove in each case what  documents  are
    required for an appellant to book and board an internal flight in Iraq,
    and that he possesses or can  obtain  them.   It  is  enough  that  the
    general availability of travel is  established,  and  that  is  not  in
    dispute.

    (2) The form of words used in the paragraph does not find its way  into
    the guidance which is set out at paragraph 204 and headnote 20, thus:

          Whether a  Kurd,  if  returned  to  Baghdad,  can  reasonably  be
          expected to avoid any potential undue harshness in that  city  by
          travelling to the IKR, will be fact sensitive; and is  likely  to
          involve an assessment of (a) practicality of travel from  Baghdad
          to the IKR (such as to Erbil  by  air);  (b)  the  likelihood  of
          securing employment in the  IKR;  and  (c)  the  availability  of
          assistance from family and friends in the IKR.

    (3) In so far as paragraph 170 suggests that the burden  on  the  SSHD,
    the passage is of no binding  effect,  is  not  incorporated  into  the
    guidance, and I respectfully disagree.  The proposition is contrary  to
    principle.  The respondent makes travel arrangements after  not  before
    conclusion of an appeal.  It would be unworkable to have  to  put  such
    arrangements in place prior to appeal hearings.  Many cases  include  a
    claim to fear the national authorities, and so to approach  them  might
    well be unlawful.  Issues about return in the event of an  unsuccessful
    appeal are for resolution later  (if  necessary,  by  way  of  judicial
    review) not while the appeal process remains live.

19. The judge was not shown that he had to delve any further  than  he  did
    into the question of documentation needed to book and board a flight to
    Erbil, or directed to any evidence on that point which might have  made
    the appellant's case.

20. For these reasons, I find that the  grounds  and  submissions  for  the
    appellant do not show that the making of the FtT's decision of the  FtT
    involved the making of an error on a point of law. That decision  shall
    stand.

21. An anonymity direction was  made  in  the  FtT.   The  matter  was  not
    addressed in the UT, so anonymity has been preserved herein.
