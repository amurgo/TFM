For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.   In this decision I will continue to  refer  to  the  parties  by  their
    designations before the First-tier Tribunal (FtT).

2.   The background to this appeal is set out in the  decision  and  reasons
    dated 29 January 2015 which I issued following  the  hearing  at  Field
    House on 12 November 2014.

3.   At that hearing, following representations by both parties,  I  decided
    that the FtT had made a material error of law such  that  the  decision
    had to be set aside.  However, the findings of fact  of  the  FtT  were
    preserved.

4.   Directions were made for the further conduct of the  appeal,  including
    a further hearing at which both parties were to return to with  a  time
    estimate of two hours.  The  parties  were  to  file  updated  evidence
    limited  to  developments  since  the  decision  of  the  FtT  and   an
    interpreter was required for the adjourned hearing.

5.   The hearing was listed before me on 14 January 2016  at  10am.   Again,
    both parties attended and were represented.

The Hearing

6.   At the outset of the hearing Mr Farhat  confirmed  that  the  following
    documents would be required:
    (1)  the bundle for the first FtT;
    (2)  his client's witness statement.

7.   Mr Farhat notified the Tribunal that FC's application  for  nationality
    had been successful.

8.   In the paragraphs that follow I will refer to the page numbers  in  the
    original appeal bundle  before  the  FtT  as  "AB"  and  those  in  the
    supplemental bundle as "SB".

9.   Mrs Borda confirmed that her witness statement at page  26  of  SB  was
    correct.  She said that her son, FC,  had  achieved  a  high  level  of
    competence in maths.  He was regarded as being well ahead  of  his  age
    group.  I was referred to some certificates that he had achieved.   Her
    son was also a keen swimmer.  He had progressed from  being  afraid  of
    the water to being skilled and accomplished at stage 9.  He was also  a
    top table tennis player.  As to his  language  ability,  the  appellant
    said she did not think her son could express himself in Spanish but  he
    could speak some of the language.  He could not read or write it.   She
    thought it would damage his confidence if he had to return to  Columbia
    or Bolivia.

10.  Mr Nath challenged the assertion that FC would  find  it  difficult  to
    pick up a higher level of proficiency in Spanish.  In  answer  to  some
    further questions from Mr Nath, Mrs Borda said that she had  a  mother,
    uncle and cousins in Columbia but  that  she  was  an  only  child  and
    therefore had no siblings.  She stated that her mother  and  her  uncle
    were still in Columbia.  Only five cousins were left in  Columbia,  the
    others having left that  country.   Both  her  mother  and  uncle  were
    getting  elderly.  They  lived  together  in  the  same   two-bedroomed
    property.  As far as FC's identity was concerned,  he  did  not  regard
    himself as being either Bolivian or Columbian.  Mrs Borda was  able  to
    name her cousins but said she had not talked to them for  "many  years"
    save for the cousin called Astor, whom she had spoken to more recently.



11.  The appellant also had friends in Columbia  but  she  claimed  to  have
    lost touch with some of them.

12.  As far as her husband's  family  is  concerned  he  had  a  mother  and
    brother living in Bolivia.  Mrs Borda claimed that she had  no  contact
    with her mother-in-law.  She was  "not  really"  in  touch  with  other
    family members either.

13.  It was put to the appellant that although the  cost  of  educating  her
    son may be greater in South America than it  is  in  the  UK,  all  the
    extracurricular activities that her  son  enjoyed  would  be  available
    there.  She seemed to suggest that the standard of  education  is  more
    basic than it is here and the extracurricular activities would have  to
    be bought at some expense.

14.  Mr Nath then suggested that Mrs Borda's English language  skills  would
    stand her in good stead when taking up  paid  employment  in  Columbia.
    However, her husband achieved only modest  earnings  as  a  waiter,  of
    anything between �600 and �2,500  a  month  net.   However,  Mrs  Borda
    worked for an American company arranging travel workshops for its staff
    and other events.

15.  Rolando Castellon was then called to give  evidence.   He  referred  to
    his witness statement at page 24 of SB.  He said that his son had  kung
    fu  lessons  and  had  progressed  to  the  "orange"  level.    Rolando
    Castellon, having been excluded from the hearing room during his wife's
    evidence,  gave  a  slightly  different   version   of   his   family's
    relationship with his wife.  Mr Castellon  had  a  mother,  a  brother,
    nephews, nieces and two sisters.  However, the sisters were at the time
    of the hearing living in Spain.  He said that they stayed in touch with
    each other and that his sisters went to see  his  mother  who  was  not
    well.  They also stayed in touch with his son FC.  Mrs Borda  regularly
    spoke to his mother because she was not well.  Their son also stayed in
    touch with his mother.  Mrs Borda had no problems with  Mr  Castellon's
    family but had not actually met his mother; only his sister.

16.  Mr Castellon said that he had been in the UK for fourteen years but  if
    he did return to Bolivia would have to find somewhere to live.  He  had
    worked in his present job in the UK for four years, he thought, earning
    approximately �400 per week.  He said that the "basics of life" in  the
    UK were different from those in Bolivia.

17.  It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the burden rested  on
    the appellants to prove the extent of their private and/or family  life
    in the UK.  There were good quality schools in Bolivia and Columbia and
    it had not been established that FC would  receive  a  worse  education
    there.  Mrs Borda worked for an American company which should  make  it
    easier for her to gain employment in a Latin American company and  both
    partners had extended family members in their respective  countries  of
    origin.  Accommodation was probably  available  for  them.   Certainly,
    there is no evidence that they were homeless when  they  left  Columbia
    and Bolivia respectively.  The adult appellants were probably fluent in
    both Spanish and English and both had been able to find  employment  in
    the UK.  I was referred to the case of AM Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC).
     In particular, I was referred to the sixth paragraph of the  headnote.
    As far as 117B (6) of the 2002 Act  was  concerned,  the  question  was
    whether it was reasonable to expect a child to follow  his  parents  to
    their country of origin.  I was also referred to the case of SS (Congo)
    where, at paragraph 39, the Court of Appeal reiterated that it was  not
    open to a couple to choose which state to form a family life  in.   The
    state was entitled to control immigration.  The right under  Article  8
    to a protected private  or  family  life  was  operated  negatively  to
    prevent the respondent interfering with  that  right  in  circumstances
    where the Convention was engaged.  Finally, I was referred to the  case
    of Bassadi (reference not supplied).   The  reasons  for  refusal  were
    relied on in  full  and  I  was  invited  to  conclude  there  were  no
    satisfactory documents to support the earnings claimed.

18.  The appellant submitted that FC  had  become  well-established  in  the
    English school system  and  compelling  reasons  would  be  needed  for
    disrupting his education.  I was referred to the case of Moayed  [2013]
    UKUT 00197 (IAC)  where,  at  paragraph  3  of  the  headnote,  it  was
    emphasised that the Tribunal had to act on the evidence.  It was stated
    in that  case  that  the  period  between  the  age  of  4  and  7  are
    particularly important in the life of a child.   Azamin  Moayed  was  a
    foreign national whereas FC had now  been  given  British  citizenship.
    Although the presence of a child in the UK was not a  "trump  card"  it
    was necessarily a weighty factor.  ZH  (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC  4  was
    authority for the proposition that there is a duty not to deprive a  UK
    citizen of the benefits of his nationality.  It was also submitted that
    FC's Spanish would not be  sufficiently  good  to  engage  in  as  many
    activities as he had done in the UK.  Both parents  provided  a  stable
    home for FC and his subsisting relationship with the child  means  that
    they should not be removed at least while he is a child.  An additional
    factor, which does not appear in the respondent's papers,  is  that  Mr
    Castellon had assisted the police with a murder enquiry.

19.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision as to the  outcome  of
    the appeal.

Discussion

20.  Mrs Borda first came to the UK in November 2001  with  entry  clearance
    valid until April 2002. As a result of various extensions to her leave,
    on the basis of being a student, and as a  result  of  various  appeals
    that were pursued, she was allowed to stay until May 2006.  Since  then
    she has not been in the UK  legally  as  her  appeal  rights  had  been
    exhausted, although she has, from time to time, been working.

21.  Mr Castellon is also an illegal overstayer who has not  had  any  right
    to be in the UK since 2003.

22.  Their son, FC, was born here in  May  2005  and  has  lived  here  ever
    since.  He has been educated  at  the  taxpayer's  expense  in  English
    schools and is presently aged 10.  He has  recently  become  a  British
    citizen.

23.  The appellant's representatives have made a number of valid  points  in
    their "brief outline of case" dated 14 January 2016 and I  am  grateful
    to both parties for their submissions.  Essentially, Mr Farhat  focused
    on the degree of  cultural  and  educational  assimilation  of  FC  and
    pointed out that FC's welfare was a primary consideration in this  case
    having  regard  to  the  provisions  of  Section  55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 ("2009  Act").   The  respondent's
    own guidance (in  a  document  headed  "Every  Child  Matters")  places
    emphasis on the need to safeguard and promote the welfare  of  children
    in  relation  to  immigration  decisions  as  well  as  support   their
    intellectual, emotional, social  and  behavioural  development.   Other
    points that were emphasised in submissions included  the  fact  that  a
    child's development between the age of 4 and approximately the  age  of
    11 are likely to be particularly important  to  his  long-term  future.
    Those years have been spent by FC in the English school system.

24.  A persuasive point in the appellants' favour  is  that  there  must  be
    compelling reasons for removing FC or, to put as Moses LJ put it in the
    case of Jagot [2000] INLR 501, a child is  not  responsible  or  to  be
    punished for the behaviour of his parents.  FC as  a  British  national
    has every right to be educated  here  and  to  receive  the  same  high
    welfare rights as fellow citizens.  His removal will inevitably  result
    in a significant interference with these rights.  Do FC's welfare needs
    outweigh other considerations?

25.  First of all, the extensive submissions,  orally  and  in  writing,  in
    support of FC's welfare need to be qualified by the fact that he has in
    fact completed or  is  about  to  complete  the  seventh  year  of  the
    important "four to seven years" referred to in the case of Azimi-Moayed
    [2013] UKUT 00197 (IAC).  If he does need to be moved this may not be a
    bad time to move him.  He  has  a  much  better  relationship  with  Mr
    Castellon's family in Bolivia than Mrs Borda  was  prepared  to  admit.
    Indeed, his relationship with his grandparents appears to be  good  and
    it will possibly develop further if he lived in  the  same  country  as
    them.  Exposure to the Latin American culture and a close  relationship
    with his extended family are undoubtedly positives to be  weighed  into
    the balance of any suggestion that his welfare will be disrupted by his
    removal with his parents.  Some disruption inevitably flows from moving
    school but many children have to endure this.  I do not accept that the
    removal of FC will have a negative long-term impact on  his  education,
    although it will undoubtedly cause some short-term disruption.

26.  The fundamental point here is that this family is likely to  leave  the
    UK as one unit.  Regrettable though it is that FC will not continue  to
    enjoy all the  benefits  of  the  English  education  system,  he  will
    undoubtedly  gain  other  benefits  mentioned.    With   respect,   the
    appellants' submissions do not attach proper weight to the respondent's
    interest in the need to maintain effective  immigration  control.   The
    fact cannot be ignored that FC's parents are  two  illegal  overstayers
    who have remained in the UK in circumstances where they must have known
    that their private or family life was  precarious.   They  acknowledged
    that they do not qualify under any of the Immigration Rules which  were
    put in place to ensure that  those  settling  in  the  UK  meet  proper
    criteria, including financial criteria, before being  given  indefinite
    leave to remain.  Their  claim  is  put  forward  on  a  "freestanding"
    Article 8 basis but  in  recent  authorities  it  is  clear  that  some
    exceptional reasons are needed to justify considering  a  case  outside
    the Immigration Rules, which are intended to provide a  complete  code.
    Those rules appear to cater adequately for settlement in cases such  as
    this one.

27.  The respondent has a powerful argument in saying that consideration  of
    the merits of removing FC cannot be the end of  the  discussion.   FC's
    parents have no right to be in  the  UK  and  this,  along  with  other
    factors, distinguishes the case from ZH (Tanzania),  a  case  involving
    one foreign parent, two British national children and a British parent.
     Additionally, it is not the case that FC has no connection with either
    Bolivia or Columbia.  He undoubtedly would have been exposed on a daily
    basis to the Spanish language at home and there may be some  refinement
    to his written and linguistic skills but both parents will be going  to
    a country with which they are culturally and  linguistically  familiar.
    As I have  said,  the  consequential  connection  between  FC  and  his
    extended family in one of those Latin American countries is undoubtedly
    a positive in my view.

28.  Both appellants are well-educated and  would  have  good  prospects  of
    obtaining employment in their respective countries.   Additionally,  Mr
    Castellon acknowledged that his family would provide  accommodation  if
    he was unable to provide accommodation for his wife and child.  I  note
    that there was apparently no problem in finding accommodation when  the
    adult appellants last lived in their respective countries.

Conclusions

29.  The circumstances where neither of them satisfied the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules. This is not an exceptional  case  in  which  the
    claim fell to be considered outside the Immigration Rules. I  have  not
    accepted that the adult appellants should be allowed to stay in the  UK
    for the purposes of providing an environment  for  their  child  to  be
    brought up in the English education system when there  is  no  adequate
    evidence that FC cannot be educated in either Bolivia or Colombia.

Notice of Decision

Having carefully  appraised  the  facts  afresh  I  am  satisfied  that  the
decision of the respondent  to  refuse  leave  to  remain  on  human  rights
grounds was correct.  Accordingly, that  decision  stands  and  the  present
appeal by the respondent against the decision of the FtT is allowed and  the
decision of the FtT is set aside.

No anonymity direction is made.
