                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Porter  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
    against refusal of asylum by a decision promulgated on 22 June 2017.

The grounds of appeal to the UT

 2. The grounds, all centred on ï¿½26 and 27 of the decision, in summary  are
    these:

      (i) absence of reasoning for adverse conclusions reached;

      (ii) acceptance of reasoning in the respondent's  refusal  letter  and
      submissions, constituting a failure to assess the facts;

      (iii) founding on a change in the appellant's evidence about  when  he
      was pressed  by  his  father  to  become  a  suicide  bomber,  without
      considering his explanation;

      (iv) findings made  on  state  protection,  without  consideration  of
      background  evidence  of  inability  of  the  state  to  provide  such
      protection;

      (v) finding on internal relocation, reached without  consideration  of
      background evidence of circumstances of IDP's;

      (vi) not accepting appellant would become  an  IDP,  based  on  family
      connections, when his family was the source of risk;

      (vii) failure to make a finding  on  whether  appellant's  father  and
      uncle were members of the Taliban;

      (viii) cumulatively, errors such as to require a rehearing.

Respondent's rule 24 response to the grounds of appeal

 3. The judge set out the challenges  to  the  appellant's  credibility  at
    paragraph 13, and the responses on his behalf at paragraphs 16 to 18.

 4. The judge carefully recorded all the evidence on  which  she  made  her
    findings.

 5.  At  paragraph  26  she  addressed  the  credibility  issues  and   the
    submissions made on the basis of the cross-examination.

 6. Having heard and noted the evidence, the judge was entitled to  make  a
    finding on what she considered the core of the claim,  "the  change  in
    testimony relating to when [the appellant's] father first asked him  to
    be a suicide bomber".

 7. Having heard the  appellant's  answers  to  the  challenges  in  cross-
    examination, the judge was entitled to find those answers inconsistent,
    evasive and highly implausible.

 8. It was trite law that the judge need not make findings on  all  aspects
    so long as she addressed the core of the  claim  and  relevant  country
    guidance.

 9. The judge found the appellant not credible on the core of his account.

10. Alternatively, the judge had found internal relocation open  to  Kabul,
    as the background evidence did not point against the country guidance.

Submissions for appellant

11. Grounds (i) - (iii) overlap. The overriding error was the  adoption  of
    the reasoning of the respondent, a one-sided approach. The judge failed
    to give her own reasons.   Submissions  made  for  the  appellant  were
    recorded, but not dealt with. The judge founded upon  inconsistency  in
    the appellant's evidence, without addressing his explanation, a  matter
    which went to the core of the claim.

12. In respect of a medical report, the  judge  put  the  cart  before  the
    horse. She evaluated the report after stating  an  adverse  credibility
    finding.

13. Grounds (iv) - (vi) were also interrelated. They disclosed a failure to
    deal with the background evidence.  It  was  accepted  that  for  those
    grounds to become relevant, the appellant would firstly  have  to  show
    error in terms of grounds (i) - (iii).

14. At paragraph 27, the judge appeared to base  her  decision  on  matters
    which she had previously rejected.  She could not have it both ways.

Submissions for respondent

15. The rule 24 response was well made.

16. It was not best practice but not necessarily an error for  a  judge  to
    adopt submissions by one party.  The issue had to be  examined  in  the
    context of the case. The judge fully set  out  the  positions  of  both
    sides, and the evidence. The decision made it clear why she decided  as
    she did.

17. The challenge to the treatment of the medical evidence was not  covered
    by the grounds of appeal. The order of approach to the medical evidence
    was unfortunate and the wording perhaps imperfect, but in any event the
    medical evidence had not gone above showing  a  level  of  consistency,
    which the judge recognised.

18. The alternative conclusions would stand even if the  challenge  to  the
    credibility assessment was made out.

19. No reason was shown to set aside the decision.

Reply for appellant.

20. The submission about the medical report was  sufficiently  grounded  in
    the challenge to the adequacy of the judge's reasoning.

21. The judge said that  she  founded  on  evasive  answers  given  by  the
    appellant, but she attached no examples to her reasoning.  She did  not
    refer back to the evidence which she set out.

22. In reaching conclusions in the alternative, the judge did not refer  to
    the background evidence about  the  reach  of  the  Taleban,  or  about
    difficulties facing IDP's.  The issues of sufficiency of protection and
    internal relocation were inadequately addressed.

Discussion and conclusions.

23. Reading grounds (i) - (iii) and only  paragraph  26  of  the  decision,
    those grounds have some apparent force; but that dissipates on  reading
    the decision as a whole.

24. The discrepancies and weaknesses in the appellant's evidence are  fully
    narrated, and the judge was entitled to find that they were not  merely
    elaborations, as submitted on his behalf.  Little further needed to  be
    said.

25. The essence of the appellant's case was that his father tried to  press
    him into becoming a suicide bomber.  Paragraph 7 of the decision brings
    out clearly the central self-contradiction, which was over whether that
    pressure was applied  over  the  appellant's  lifetime  (for  about  20
    years), or not until the moment when he saw  a  suicide  belt  at  home
    (when he was aged 22 or 23).  The appellant's explanations are set  out
    and so are the competing submissions.  The judge found there to  be  no
    sensible explaining  away  of  the  contradiction.   That  finding  was
    properly reached.

26. Whether to state which submissions she preferred, or  to  re-frame  the
    reasons as her own, was a matter of choice and of style, rather than of
    substance.

27. The judge had the advantage of hearing the evidence, and  was  entitled
    to consider how the appellant dealt with questions.  It would have been
    better to quote examples, or to specifically cross-refer to passages of
    evidence recorded, but that is another counsel of perfection.

28. Reading the decision fairly and as a whole, the appellant is left in no
    doubt why his evidence has fallen short of persuading the judge.

29. The "cart before the  horse"  challenge  is  not  foreshadowed  in  the
    grounds.

30. The appellant does not disagree with the assessment  that  the  medical
    report disclosed only scars  consistent  with  his  account,  but  non-
    specific, and attributable to a number of other  possible  causes.   It
    was not going to take the appellant any further than  the  judge  said:
    "no significant bearing on my assessment of credibility".

31. The extent to  which  the  medical  report  supported  the  appellant's
    account should have been set out  before  turning  to  credibility.  It
    should not have been evaluated in a way which reads as  if  credibility
    was decided, and then it was asked if the  report  made  a  difference.
    However, the report contains nothing which suggests  any  chance  of  a
    different outcome if the matter  had  been  approached  the  right  way
    around.

32. To succeed on grounds (iv) - (vi), the appellant  would  have  to  show
    that he made a case on background evidence which required the judge  to
    go beyond country guidance on sufficiency of  protection  and  internal
    relocation.  Background evidence was filed, but no case  was  developed
    that these were materials of a nature different to those considered  in
    the country guidance cases, so as to require departure  from  authority
    (cf. Practice Direction 12).

33. In absence of any such analysis by the appellant, the case was bound to
    fail in any event on the alternative conclusions, even if grounds (i) -
    (iii) had been made out.

34. The decision of the FtT shall stand.

35. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
