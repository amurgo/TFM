Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance by or on behalf of the respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   There was no appearance on behalf of the respondent.  I  was  satisfied
    that the notice of hearing had been sent to the claimant  in  Pakistan,
    Sky Solicitors Limited in London and her sponsor in Newport.  As  there
    was no explanation for the non-appearance, I proceeded with the hearing
    in the absence of any representation on her behalf.

2.   The appellant, (the ECO) has been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rowlands  allowing  the
    respondent's appeal against refusal to grant her entry clearance to the
    UK as the spouse of a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant under the Points-
    Based System as being not in accordance with the law and also  allowing
    the  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds.   The  judge   dismissed   the
    respondent's appeal on immigration grounds.

3.   The respondent, who will now be referred  to  as  the  claimant,  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan born on 4 July 1991.  Her application  was  refused
    because she had not supplied acceptable specified evidence to establish
    the required funds of �600 for 90 days prior to the application,  which
    she had made on 7 December 2012.  The claimant had  submitted  Barclays
    Bank statements from her husband  to  demonstrate  funds  available  as
    maintenance  for  her.   However  the  statements  were  a  mixture  of
    originals, photocopies and scanned copies which the ECO  said  did  not
    conform to the  specified  documents  required  as  evidence.   He  was
    therefore not able  to  take  them  into  account  in  considering  her
    application.  In light of this, the ECO was not  satisfied  that  there
    was a sufficient level of funds available to the claimant, as specified
    in Appendix E of the Immigration Rules, 319C(g).

4.    The  judge  found  that  copy  statements  were  supplied   with   the
    application relating to a Barclays Bank account in the sponsor's  name,
    for the period 23 August to 21  December  2012.   At  the  hearing  the
    sponsor produced specified copies  of  those  statements,  meeting  the
    requirements of Appendix C of the Rules and bearing the official  stamp
    of the bank on every page.  He found that those statements  established
    that the said account was in credit for a sum in excess of  �2,000  for
    the continuous period from 23 August 2012 to 21 December  2012,  a  sum
    well in excess of the required amount.

5.   Nevertheless the judge  considered  that  the  ECO's  decision  was  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules because  the  documents  supplied
    with the application did not meet the specified criteria.  He dismissed
    the appeal on immigration grounds.

6.   The judge said that between the date of the application on  7  December
    2012 and the date of the  ECO's  decision  on  31  December  2012,  the
    provisions of paragraph 245AA had changed with the deletion  of  "will"
    to be replaced by "may".  He found that the circumstances of this  case
    equated to the circumstances in paragraph 245AA  where  the  respondent
    "may" (prior to 13 December 2012 - will) contact the applicant  or  his
    representative and request the correct documents.  The sole  basis  for
    refusal was that the bank statements supplied were in the wrong format,
    all were copies and not an original document.  He found that this was a
    case  in  which  no  contact  was  made  with  the  claimant   or   her
    representative.  The decision not  to  contact  the  claimant  was  not
    justified by any reason that would have led to the grant being  refused
    in any event.


7.   The judge relied on the decision in Thakur and found that  the  failure
    to afford the claimant  the  opportunity  of  correcting  the  omission
    amounted to an unfairness.   Consequently,  he  found  that  the  ECO's
    decision was not in accordance with the law and allowed the  appeal  on
    this basis.

8.   The judge also found that the claimant and her sponsor  enjoyed  family
    life together.  He found that the ECO's decision did not meet the  UK's
    responsibilities to facilitate family reunion.  Having found  that  the
    ECO's decision was not in  accordance  with  the  law,  and  served  no
    legitimate  purpose  in  enforcing  consistent  and  fair   immigration
    control,  he  found   that   the   decision   under   Article   8   was
    disproportionate.  The  claimant  had  sufficient  funds  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.  The ECO could and should have contacted the
    claimant in order that correct documents could be supplied and if  such
    contact had been made, that  the  correct  documents  would  have  been
    supplied.  To refuse the opportunity of reunion against that background
    was disproportionate.

9.   Mr Wilding submitted and I agreed with him that  paragraph  245AA  does
    not apply to this case at all.  The evidential  flexibility  policy  in
    245AA only applies to an application under part 6A of  the  Immigration
    Rules  in  relation  to  the  Points-Based  System.    The   claimant's
    application was made under part 8 of the Immigration Rules, which is in
    respect of an entry clearance application  made  by  an  applicant  who
    wants leave to enter as a partner of  a  relevant  Points-Based  System
    migrant.  The relevant Rule is paragraph  319C(g).  This  is  the  Rule
    applicable to  the  claimant.   This  rule  requires  the  claimant  to
    establish that she had a sufficient level of funds available to her  as
    set out in Appendix E.  Sub-paragraph (j) of Appendix  E  requires  the
    claimant to provide specified documents, and  these  are  specified  at
    Appendix C  (1B)(a).   They  are  personal  bank  or  building  society
    statements which cover a consecutive 90 day period of  time,  the  most
    recent statement must be dated no earlier than 31 days before the  date
    of application, and the statements must be either printed on the bank's
    or building society's letterhead; electronic bank or  building  society
    statements from an online account, bearing the official  stamp  of  the
    bank or building society on every page.

10.  It can be seen from the above that the bank statements supplied by  the
    claimant did not satisfy any of these requirements.  As paragraph 245AA
    did not apply in this case,  the  judge  materially  erred  in  law  in
    placing reliance on Thakur to allow the claimant's appeal.

11.   I set it aside and re-make it.

12.  The claimant did not submit  original  documents  as  required  in  the
    Appendices to the Immigration Rules.  The ECO's decision  refusing  the
    claimant entry clearance was in accordance with the law.

13.  I find that the judge also erred  in  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.   I  agree  with  the  submission  in  the
    grounds on behalf of the ECO that the claimant and her husband  do  not
    currently enjoy family life together.   As  the  judge's  decision  was
    partly based on his erroneous finding that the ECO's decision  was  not
    in accordance with the law, I find  that  his  decision  on  Article  8
    cannot also stand.  I set that decision aside.

14.  The claimant's appeal against the ECO's decision is dismissed.
