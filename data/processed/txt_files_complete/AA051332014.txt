Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Hussain, of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Albania born 8th March 1992. She  appeals
    with permission the decision of FtT Judge  Bagral  who  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 22nd September 2014, dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the Respondent's refusal to grant her asylum and to remove  her
    from the UK by the way of directions.



Background

 2. The Appellant's  history  is  that  she  left  Albania  in  March  2013
    travelling to Belgium on her own Albanian passport. She was  trafficked
    to Belgium by her boyfriend G; and once  there  forced,  by  him,  into
    prostitution. She became pregnant and  asked  a  friend  who  was  also
    working as a prostitute to help her leave. Her friend helped her find a
    lorry which was travelling to the  UK  and  she  arrived  here  on  5th
    November 2013.  She made an application  for  asylum  on  6th  November
    2013. She subsequently gave birth to her child on 12th February 2014.

 3. Her claims to a need for protection can be summarised as follows;

      i) She cannot return to Albania on account of being  a  single  female
         with an illegitimate child. She claims  that  single  females  with
         illegitimate children are in danger  of  being  rejected  by  their
         family members and relations or killed;

     ii) She cannot live in another part of Albania, due to the insecurities
         there;

    iii) She cannot seek protection in Albania as the  authorities  and  the
         police  force  in  Albania  do  not  take  victims  of  trafficking
         seriously.

 4. The Appellant's appeal came before FtT Judge Bagral who noted  at  [28]
    and [29] in her decision  the following,

         "The factual background is uncontentious.  The  Respondent  accepts
         the entirety of the Appellant's factual account. Having  considered
         the evidence before me, I agree that that concession  was  properly
         made. I accept the Appellant's account is credible  the  background
         to which, I have set out above, and I find accordingly.

         I am satisfied on the basis of the accepted  factual  account  that
         the Appellant is a victim of trafficking and has experienced sexual
         exploitation and abuse at the hands  of  G  who  she  trusted.  The
         Appellant was befriended by him and  he  arranged  for  her  travel
         documents and persuaded her to leave the country  enabling  her  to
         travel to Belgium. Such a practice of targeting young women who are
         perceived to be vulnerable  is  noted  in  the  background  country
         information."

 5. The Judge then went on to assess what was recorded as the issues before
    her namely, sufficiency of protection and internal flight alternative.

 6. Having considered those matters, the Judge made a  finding  that  there
    was sufficiency of protection for the Appellant  as  it  would  not  be
    unreasonable  for  her  to  relocate  to  Tirana.  In  coming  to  that
    conclusion she took into account that an IOM package would be available
    for the Appellant on return.

 7. Permission to appeal the Judge's decision was sought and granted. It is
    clear from the grant of permission that the only arguable point is  one
    relating to whether the IOM package set up for  the  Appellant  by  the
    Respondent will adequately cater for the Appellant's assimilation.  The
    relevant parts of the grant of permission are as follows.

         "...The core finding is that the IOM package set up on  1.11.13  on
         behalf of the respondent will adequately cater for the  appellant's
         re-assimilation. The key country guidance (AM  &  BM)  states  that
         women in the appellant's position are likely to be (a) abandoned by
         their families; (b) forced to abandon their illegitimate child; (c)
         re-trafficked. It is arguable that an error arises from omitting to
         consider (a) how long the package will last and (b) the  extent  to
         which an infant can be catered for while the appellant develops  an
         alternative skill such as hairdressing (ï¿½ 52) as envisaged."

Upper Tribunal Hearing

 8. The appeal came before me on 17th  December  2014as  an  error  of  law
    hearing.  I  heard  submissions  from  Mr  Hussain  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant and Mr Diwnycz on behalf of the Respondent.

 9. Mr Hussain sought to rely on the  grounds  drafted  seeking  permission
    which were drafted by him.  He submitted that the FtT Judge  had  erred
    in her assessment of internal flight to Tirana. He said that  ground  3
    disclosed two reasons amounting to error.

      i) The country guidance case of AM and BM CG [2010] UKUT 80  (IAC)  is
         clear. The Appellant now has a child conceived out of wedlock.   He
         accepted that there are temporary shelters in Tirana for  women  in
         this position, but said that no thought had been given to  how  the
         Appellant would sustain herself in the  long  run.  The  Judge  had
         failed to engage with and means that there is a risk factor  making
         internal flight alternative non-viable.

     ii) Mr Hussain submitted that there was no detail whatsoever as to what
         the IOM package would involve. He said that he accepted it was  for
         the Appellant to establish her evidence that she would be  at  risk
         but it was the Respondent who was claiming that there  is  no  risk
         factor because of the IOM package.

10. Mr Diwnycz relied on the Rule  24  response.   He  submitted  that  the
    Judge's determination is a well constructed one. The  Judge  has  given
    clear reasons for her findings that the Appellant and her  child  would
    not be at risk on  return  to  Albania.  She  has  had  regard  to  the
    background country material and taken into account that the  IOM  makes
    provision for individuals being returned with children. The Judge  also
    properly considered whether the Appellant would be at risk of being re-
    trafficked and found that there is no risk in  this  Appellant's  case.
    The determination is sustainable and the decision should stand.

Consideration

11. The basis of Mr Hussain's  submissions  is  that  the  Appellant  fears
    relocation to Tirana away from her home area because;

      i) She will find herself with a very young child and have limited  and
         temporary support only  from shelters;

     ii) The additional risk  factor  is  that  she  is  the  mother  of  an
         illegitimate child;

    iii) With a young child to care for and being  unable  to  work  without
         someone caring for the child, the Appellant is at risk of having to
         turn to  her  family  in  desperation  and  this  could  result  in
         relocation being unreasonably harsh for her.

    Consequently the Judge erred in not considering  adequately  the  long-
    term future of the Appellant.

12. I disagree with this and my findings for so doing are set out below. It
    is clear that the Judge kept in mind the country guidance  case  of  AM
    and BM. She was clearly aware of it because she specifically refers  to
    it in [39]. Most particularly she refers to these sections of AM and BM
    which states,

         "..."(vi) Trafficked women from Albania may well be  members  of  a
         particular social group on that account alone. Whether they are  at
         risk of persecution on account of such membership and whether  they
         will  be  able  to  access  sufficiency  of  protection  from   the
         authorities  will  depend  upon  their   individual   circumstances
         including but not limited to the following: (a) The  social  status
         and economic standing of the trafficked  woman's  family;  (b)  The
         level of education of the trafficked woman or her family;  (c)  The
         trafficked woman's state of health, particularly her mental health;
         (d) The presence of an illegitimate child; (e) The area  of  origin
         of the trafficked woman's family; and (f)  The  trafficked  woman's
         age.""

13. Having kept that guidance in mind, the Judge in paragraph [51] to  [55]
    of her determination directs her mind to those  very  points  which  Mr
    Hussain says causes concern.

14. In paragraph [51] the Judge states,

         "...Mr Hussain submitted  that  the  report  did  not  sufficiently
         detail the  extent  of  the  support  being  offered  through  this
         package,  but  as  the  evidence  points  out,   support   includes
         accommodation, education, vocational  training,  start-up  business
         activity, employment subsidiary salary and medical support. Support
         is tailored to the needs of the individual and I have no reason  to
         believe that the  Appellant's  circumstances  as  a  single  mother
         cannot be catered for. I remind myself that it is for the Appellant
         to prove  that  services  and  support  available  through  such  a
         reintegration package would not be sufficient to meet her needs."

15. Further having assessed the Appellant who appeared before her the Judge
    finds that in line with the guidance given in AB and BM  how  much  the
    Appellant has going for her. The Judge clearly turns her  mind  to  the
    reintegration package because she says in [52],

         "...There is no evidence that the reintegration package is  limited
         to the extent that  she  may  be  effectively  abandoned  and  left
         destitute with a young child as she fears. It  has  thus  not  been
         established on the evidence that any degree of  vulnerability  will
         arise in the future as it did in the past. She was under no  duress
         when she left Albania and travelled to Belgium,  and  it  was  only
         when  she  was  in  Belgium  that  the  truth  of  her  boyfriend's
         intentions was discovered. She is far wiser now than she was  then,
         and there is no evidence that she is susceptible to such  a  degree
         that there is a real risk of  repetition  of  such  events  in  the
         future."

16. In [54] the  Judge  goes  on  to   find  that  the  IOM  package  makes
    provisions for individuals being returned with children and that  there
    was no real risk of  the  Appellant  being  re-trafficked  by  her  ex-
    boyfriend.

17. In my judgment, the Judge fully considers the evidence before her.  She
    has considered fully considered the Appellant's circumstances and those
    of the Appellant's child and formed conclusions which she was  properly
    entitled to reach on the evidence  before  her.  The  determination  of
    Judge Bagral discloses no error requiring it to be set aside.

Decision

18. For the foregoing reasons this appeal is dismissed.
