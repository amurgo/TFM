                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   On 1st July 2011, within the currency  of  their  leave  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 4 Migrant and his wife, Amit and Tsering  Lama
    applied for further leave to remain in the same  categories.   On  30th
    January 2012 the applications were refused, because the Confirmation of
    Acceptance for Studies issued to  Amit  Lama  by  Harrow  International
    Business School  did  not  indicate  that  he  had  achieved  level  B2
    competence in English after taking a test with an English language test
    provider approved by the Secretary of State (none of the other ways  of
    demonstrating such competence being open to him).   On  10th  September
    2012 Malik & Malik gave notice of appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    This notice should have been given within ten working days after Mr and
    Mrs Lama  had  been  served  with  notice  of  the  decision  on  their
    applications.  In the notice of appeal it is indicated that service  of
    the Home Office decision was on 4th  September,  both  the  'post'  and
    'fax/personal service' boxes being ticked.  Why it  should  have  taken
    seven months for Mr and Mrs Lama to be  notified  of  the  decision  on
    their applications is not a question that occurred  to  anyone  in  the
    course of these appeals, and it only occurred  to  me  when  I  started
    writing this determination.  Curiously, at the back of the  court  file
    there is a  pay  slip  signed  by  Amit  Lama  on  3rd  February  2012,
    authorizing the Tribunal Service to  debit  the  appeal  fee  from  his
    payment card.  But there is nothing else to show that notice of  appeal
    was given any earlier than 10th September, and  a  Certificate  of  Fee
    Satisfaction was only issued on 13th September 2012.  A point  of  sale
    receipt for �80 was issued on 17th September.

2.    The fee of �80 was for a determination 'on the papers',  as  requested
    in the notice of appeal, and it was for one appeal  only.   The  IAFT-1
    notice submitted by Malik & Malik was just for Amit Lama, and only  one
    appeal fee was paid.  There is nothing in Tsering Lama's file  to  show
    that notice of appeal was also given on her behalf, or that  an  appeal
    fee was paid.  Yet separate files  were  opened,  and  separate  appeal
    numbers assigned, to both Amit  and  Tsering  Lama.   This  is  another
    difficulty that only occurred to me after the hearing.  I turn  now  to
    the difficulties which I did raise at the hearing.

3.   The grounds of appeal drafted by Malik & Malik  are  couched  in  vague
    and formulaic terms.  Mention is made of the  'evidential  flexibility'
    policy, and there is a  reference  to  "paragraph  16  of  the  refusal
    letter".  The refusal letter has no numbered paragraphs, so one  cannot
    tell what is being referred to.  There is no suggestion  that  Mr  Lama
    has at any time obtained  an  English  language  test  certificate,  as
    required by Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

4.   On 26th September 2012 the First-tier Tribunal sent an IA35  notice  to
    Malik & Malik, confirming that the appeal would be  determined  on  the
    papers, and giving a deadline of 24th October for the  receipt  of  any
    further documents or submissions.  On that  very  date  Malik  &  Malik
    wrote to the Arnhem Support Centre in  Leicester,  requesting  an  oral
    hearing.  The letter was stamped as  received  at  the  Centre  on  7th
    November.  The envelope in which it came has not been preserved, so one
    cannot tell when the letter was actually posted.  Curiously,  a  letter
    was also written on 24th October to "AIT Walsall",  with  reference  to
    "hearing on 24th October 2012", but asking for an oral hearing.  Why  a
    letter was sent to  the  hearing  centre  at  Walsall  is  unexplained.
    Perhaps the solicitors made inquiry as to where the appeal  was  to  be
    determined 'on the papers'.  The papers were in fact put  before  Judge
    A.W. Khan on 30th October in Birmingham.   Meanwhile,  the  letter  was
    stamped as received by Walsall Hearing Centre on 30th October, and  was
    sent on to the Birmingham Hearing Centre, where  it  arrived  the  next
    day, with a slip saying "please list for oral".   This  was  not  done.
    Judge Khan signed off his determination on 5th  November,  and  it  was
    posted to Malik & Malik the next day.

5.   There is nothing more on file from Malik & Malik until a  letter  faxed
    and then posted to the  Arnhem  Support  Centre  on  18th  March  2013,
    requesting  a  copy  of  the  determination.   To  this   is   attached
    "reconsideration grounds",  complaining  that  the  appellant  did  not
    receive the determination, and that a copy of the determination was not
    sent to both the appellant and his representatives.  That complaint  is
    a little rich.  In their notice of appeal  Malik  &  Malik  gave  their
    client's address as c/o their own office.  The  Tribunal  staff  always
    take the appellant's address from the notice of appeal, so they had  no
    other address to send the determination to.   It  seems  odd  that  the
    determination, sent to Malik  &  Malik  by  first  class  post  on  6th
    November 2012, did not reach them.

6.   On receipt of the determination, Malik & Malik submitted  full  grounds
    of appeal against Judge Khan's determination, citing  extensively  from
    case  law  but  making  no  mention  of  the  English   language   test
    certificate, the absence of which caused Mr Lama's  application  to  be
    rejected.  Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was  granted  by
    Designated Judge Barton, who was concerned lest an administrative error
    in not  listing  the  appeal  for  an  oral  hearing  might  have  been
    productive of unfairness.  There was no 'Rule 24 Response' on file,  so
    I was surprised to learn, when the appeal came before me, that one  had
    indeed been produced by Mr Protap Nath on 4th  May.   This  did  indeed
    reach Malik & Malik, who replied (presumably under rule 25 of the Upper
    Tribunal Procedure Rules) by sending a small bundle to  the  Presenting
    Officers' Unit.  But they did not copy it to the Upper Tribunal.  I saw
    it for the first time at the hearing.

7.   The bundle contains a copy  of  an  IELTS  test  certificate,  with  an
    overall band score of 6.0, issued to Mr Lama on 20th December 2011, and
    an undated letter from Mr Lama, said to have been posted to the  Border
    Agency on the same date, asking that a decision on his  application  be
    deferred until the test certificate arrives.  The certificate itself is
    said to have been posted to the Border Agency on 28th December, so that
    it should have been with the caseworker who decided the application  on
    30th January 2012.  Mr Nasim made a valiant effort to persuade me  that
    I could find an error of law and could then use this evidence to  allow
    the  appeal.   Miss  Martin  had  come  prepared  with  authorities  on
    'evidential flexibility', the 'time line' for submission of evidence in
    support of a PBS application, and the Article  8  rights  of  students.
    Now, at last, Mr Lama had a competent  representative  to  present  his
    case, which Miss Martin was well equipped to rebut.

8.   The appeal cannot, however, get beyond the error of law stage.  I  have
    catalogued the problems which have dogged this appeal from the  outset,
    including the two  very  long  gaps  between  the  initial  immigration
    decision and the notice of appeal against it, and  between  the  First-
    tier determination and the appeal against that.  The complaint that  Mr
    (and Mrs?) Lama should have had an oral  hearing  cannot  get  off  the
    ground.  The request to switch from a decision on the  papers  was  not
    accompanied by the requisite fee.  Only �80 for a  paper  determination
    had been paid.  An oral hearing costs �140.  The balance had  not  been
    paid, and the Tribunal staff would not  have  been  able  to  list  the
    appeal for an oral hearing without a certificate of  fee  satisfaction,
    despite what was said on the note from the Walsall  to  the  Birmingham
    staff.

9.   Besides that, it is quite astonishing that, if Mr  Lama  had  sent  his
    English language test certificate to the Border Agency a  month  before
    the refusal of his application, no mention was made of that, either  in
    the notice of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, or in the  application
    for leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   This  could,  and  should,
    have been drawn to the attention of the First-tier judge.  As  it  was,
    there was nothing  before  him  which  could  possibly  have  justified
    allowing the appeal.  There has simply been no error of  law,  and  the
    appeal must fail.  I note that there has been no decision to remove  Mr
    and Mrs Lama.  It is open to them to apply to the  Secretary  of  State
    for further leave to remain on a discretionary basis, if Mr Lama  needs
    more time to complete his studies, especially if he has  for  the  last
    year and a half had  the  necessary  English  language  certificate  to
    demonstrate his ability to pursue those studies.






     DECISION

     The appeal is dismissed.
