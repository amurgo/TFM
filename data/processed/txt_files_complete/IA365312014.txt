For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


         1. Mr Edun, a citizen of Nigeria, applied, on 26th June 2014,  for
            a residence card under regulation 10(5)  Immigration  (European
            Economic Area) Regulations 2006 on  the  basis  of  a  retained
            right of residence following the  ending  of  his  marriage  to
            Adjoa Amelie Soudanie. The respondent refused the  application,
            treating it as an application for permanent residence.


         2. His appeal against that decision was  dismissed  by  First-tier
            Tribunal  judge  Woolf  for  reasons  set  out  in  a  decision
            promulgated on 6th October  2017.  Permission  to  appeal  that
            decision was granted and, for  reasons  given  orally  on  25th
            October 2018 and recorded in a written decision promulgated  on
            20th November 2018, DUTJ Jordan found the  First-tier  Tribunal
            judge had erred in law such that h decision be set aside to  be
            remade.

         3. A copy of that decision is attached but in essence, DUTJ Jordan
            noted that it seemed that the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  was
            uncertain as to the nature of the application  being  advanced;
            that there were gaps in the evidence of his  wife's  employment
            and that the judge had  failed  to  make  any  findings  as  to
            whether the appellant had a retained right of residence  rather
            than considering solely whether he had  a  right  to  permanent
            residence. DUTJ Jordan held that  First-tier  Tribunal  judge's
            conclusion that Mr Edun's wife  had  not  been  working  for  a
            continuous period of five years prior to the breakdown  of  the
            marriage was sustainable. Although, he found, that  periods  of
            some 2 months or so could be explained and not held to  disrupt
            the five-year period, the longer periods where evidence was not
            available of employment relating to 31st October  2011  to  1st
            May 2012 and 29th October 2012 to 18  September  2013  were  of
            such length as to disturb the continuity.

         4. There then followed a number of directions made which  resulted
            in the respondent disclosing the information they  held  as  to
            his former wife's employment history and immigration status.

         5. Mr Edun confirmed before me that he had separated from his wife
            in the early  part  of  2013  and  divorce  proceedings  issued
            thereafter. The decree nisi was,  as  set  out  in  the  decree
            absolute, obtained on 24th February 2014  and  decree  absolute
            was pronounced on 12th May 2014.

         6. The national insurance number provided for Ms Soudanie, was not
            an NI number registered in her name, but in  another  unrelated
            person's name. The search with HMRC in March  2017  against  Ms
            Soudanie' s temporary national  insurance  number  showed  that
            there were no National Insurance payments recorded against  her
            name for the tax years 2011/2012 and  2012/2013  or  2014/2015.
            There was no record with the DWP that Ms Soudanie had  been  in
            receipt of benefits during any of these periods.

         7. Although there was no doubt, but that the marriage  had  lasted
            the requisite period of time, what was plain was that  Mr  Edun
            could  not  produce  evidence  required  either   directly   or
            following an order of the Upper tribunal to HMRC for disclosure
            of NI records, that his former wife had been  employed  at  the
            requisite time.

         8. It follows that Mr Edun does not meet the  criteria  under  the
            2006 regulations for a retained right of residence.

         9. His appeal must therefore be dismissed.


          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law and the decision was set aside  by
    DUTJ Jordan.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.


                                   Date 17th September 2019
