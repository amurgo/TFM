                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-Tier
        Tribunal Judge Behan promulgated on the 25 July 2019 in  which  the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's  appeal  on  protection  and  human
        rights grounds.





Background


     2. The appellant is a citizen of  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo
        (DRC) born on 24 October 1997.
     3. Having considered the evidence the Judge sets out findings of  fact
        from [19] of the decision under challenge, those  relevant  to  the
        issues at this stage being summarised in the following terms:


                i. It is accepted the appellant was involved  in  LUCHA  to
                   the  extent  he  claims  and  that  he  was  arbitrarily
                   arrested and detained on three occasions in the DRC  and
                   that during all three  occasions  he  was  subjected  to
                   treatment that was degrading and inhuman in that he  was
                   beaten, held in very poor conditions and threatened with
                   further violence and death [24].
               ii. It was not accepted there was a  real  likelihood  legal
                   proceedings had been commenced against the appellant  or
                   of his being summonsed or invited to a  police  station.
                   It was not accepted there was a real likelihood  of  any
                   of the documents produced being reliable [25].
              iii. It was not accepted the appellant left the DRC  using  a
                   passport to which he was not entitled [26].
               iv. It was not accepted the appellant does  not  know  where
                   his parents are [27].
                v.  The  Judge  was  satisfied  the  appellant   had   been
                   persecuted in the past on account of his political views
                   which makes it more likely that he will be persecuted in
                   the future, but the Judge did not consider the  evidence
                   showed there was a real risk that he  is  an  individual
                   specifically targeted by the authorities [44].
               vi. It was reasonable to suppose that the Kabila regime  was
                   motivated to suppress LUCHA because of its opposition to
                   his Presidency demonstrated by calling for  an  election
                   by drawing attention to the failures of the Kabila era.
              vii. At [50] the Judge writes: "I have not been provided with
                   evidence to show that similar harsh measures  are  being
                   taken by the  security  forces  at  the  behest  of  the
                   current regime. The appellant said in his oral  evidence
                   that the UDPS share similar aims to LUCHA and so  it  is
                   reasonable to suppose that the new President will not be
                   as opposed to LUCHA as was Joseph Kabila.  One would  be
                   naï¿½ve to think that  the  DRC  since  January  become  a
                   country in which human rights  including  the  right  to
                   protest are fully respected nonetheless the  appellant's
                   case has been based on the events that took place  under
                   the Kabila presidency  and  the  change  of  regime,  is
                   something that, it is reasonable to suppose  has  reduce
                   the risk he faces if he continues  LUCHA  activities  in
                   the DRC.


     4. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
        another judge of the First-Tier  Tribunal  the  operative  part  of
        which is in the following terms:


             2.   I am satisfied that there are arguable errors of  law  in
                  the decision. In view of the Judge's findings of  fact  it
                  is arguable that the Judge should have found the Appellant
                  to be a real risk on his return to  DRC.  It  is  arguable
                  that at paragraph  45  the  decision  the  Judge  use  the
                  incorrect standard of proof. It follows from this that the
                  Judge's findings in relation to Articles 2 and  3  may  be
                  incorrect. I do note however, that the Judge did not  find
                  the Appellant to be a member  of  a  PSG  as  the  Grounds
                  assert at paragraph 4.5.


             3.   I am further satisfied that when  considering  Article  8
                  the Judge did not take account  of  the  Appellants  PTSD.
                  However, this may not amount to a material error of law.



Error of law


     5. In October 2019 it was known the Secretary of State  was  reviewing
        her position in  relation  to  return  to  the  DRC  following  the
        publishing of the "Unsafe Return III" report by  Justice  First  in
        May 2019.
     6. In the country guidance case of BM and Others (returnees  -criminal
        and non-criminal) DRC CG [2015] 293 (IAC), heard in March and April
        2015, the Home Office acknowledged,  amongst  other  things,  that,
        owing to the poor prison conditions, a period of detention of  more
        than approximately one day would result in a breach of  Article  3.
        The Upper Tribunal accepted this assessment as  'clearly  warranted
        by substantial and compelling evidence' (paragraph 13).  Conditions
        in detention centres and prisons continue to be very poor, with ill-
        treatment reportedly commonplace. It  therefore  remains  the  case
        that a person detained for more than a day, even for  short  period
        of time, is likely to face conditions that breach Article 3.
     7. The Judge has found the appellant is a known opposition member or a
        person with an adverse profile who has been detained an  illtreated
        as a result of his political views in the past.
     8. The issue of whether  a  person  such  as  the  appellant  will  be
        detained on arrival and ill-treated was considered at the  core  of
        the Unsafe Returns III report in which it is stated:


             Returnees since 2012 have faced the following difficulties and
             barriers to integration.


                   . Destitution and hunger and  homelessness  if  returnees
                     have no family in Kinshasa. Returnees do not  know  who
                     they can trust. People  who  have  taken  in  returnees
                     expect payment which puts a burden on families  in  the
                     UK. Case Study 16 (Unsafe Return III P.33) met a  human
                     rights activist who described him in  2017  as  'durty'
                     [sic] and crazy. He was sleeping  on  the  streets.  In
                     2012 the human rights group RENADHOC had stated to  the
                     UK  Fact  Finding  Mission  delegates  that  'Returnees
                     without  family  in  Kinshasa,  they  become   mentally
                     affected, with no one to care for them, no support,  so
                     become mentally ill, some just die.'


                   . Lack of ID (voters card) to present at  checkpoints  on
                     the street will lead to  risk  of  arrest.  It  is  not
                     possible to prove nationality.

                   . If unable to speak  the  local  or  national  languages
                     problems will arise. Speaking English puts returnees at
                     risk of being identified as spies in communities  where
                     there are Secret Service/police  informers.  People  in
                     DRC  believe  Rwanda  is  infiltrating  their  country.
                     Rwanda's official language is English.

                   .  Gaining  employment  has  not  proved   possible   for
                     returnees.

                   . Even when returnees have been released from the airport
                     or prison following payment, officers have gone to  the
                     address to re-arrest the returnee. The  returnees  have
                     had to move on.

                   .  Returnees  have  no  support  and  no   recourse   for
                     protection  from  United  Nations  Joint  Human  Rights
                     Office, British Embassy or IOM as the returnees are not
                     within their mandate.

                   . Money sent from UK families via Western Union cannot be
                     accessed directly due to  lack  of  ID.  Intermediaries
                     have to be  used,  putting  the  returnee  at  risk  of
                     exploitation. Returnees are threatened with exposure to
                     the DRC authorities as a spy/combatant, if they do  not
                     hand over items/money sent from UK.

                   . Mental health problems  exasperated  by  worries  about
                     their families in  the  UK  and  fears  about  personal
                     safety.

                   . Phones and  belongings  have  been  stolen  at  N'djili
                     airport and in prisons.

                Communication with family by  phone  is  difficult  because
                phones cannot be charged, places of hiding are  outside  of
                network coverage and electricity cuts.


     9. The respondent's current guidance in the  November  2019  CPIN,  at
        2.4.26, states:


             The onus will be on the person to demonstrate that they are of
             interest to the government because of profile  and  activities
             and are at risk of serious harm or persecution.


             'The  new  cabinet  in  the  Democratic  Republic  of   Congo,
             announced on Monday morning 7 months after the inauguration of
             President Felix Tshisekendi, reflects the continued  influence
             of former leader Joseph Kabila, reports the BBC's Gaius Kowene
             from the capital, Kinshasa'.  Forty two of the 65  members  of
             the Cabinet come from the FCC, his coalition which  holds  the
             majority in both Houses of Parliament. This  leaves  President
             Tshisekendi's side  holding  just  one  third  of  ministerial
             posts. Key ministries like defence, interior and finance  have
             been split 50:50.


    10.  The  Judge's  belief  that  the  elections  in  the  DRC  and  the
        appointment of  a  new  president  represented  a  seed  change  in
        relation to human rights and the ability of individuals in the  DRC
        to express opposition to the Kabila regime without  facing  adverse
        consequences, appears to be misplaced. No  objective  material  has
        been provided suggesting this is so.
    11. I find the Judge has erred in law for the reasons set  out  in  the
        grant of permission to appeal such that the decision shall  be  set
        aside.
    12. In light of the evidence regarding  the  real  risk  faced  by  the
        appellant on return, especially in light of the fact he has already
        come to the attention  of  the  authorities  as  a  result  of  his
        opposition views relating directly to the  Kabila  regime,  and  in
        light of the content of the Unsafe Returns III report, I find there
        is a real risk the appellant will be detained on return which  will
        exposed him  to  ill-treatment  sufficient  to  engage  his  rights
        pursuant to article 3 ECHR in accordance with the country  guidance
        case law.
    13. I therefore substitute a decision to  allow  the  appeal  on  human
        rights grounds pursuant to article 3 ECHR.


Decision
    14. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is allowed.

   Anonymity.


    15. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


I make such order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure     (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.
