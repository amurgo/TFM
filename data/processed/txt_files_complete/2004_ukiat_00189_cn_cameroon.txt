                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This  is  an  appeal  by  the  claimant  from  the  determination  of
      Mr Morrison sitting as an Adjudicator on  28  July  2003.   Although
      permission to appeal was refused by the Tribunal  the  Lord  Ordinary
      recalled a decision of the Immigration Appeal  Tribunal  and  granted
      leave to appeal.

2.    The facts of the case as  found  by  the  Adjudicator  are  that  the
      claimant is from the Bamileke ethnic group and was appointed chief of
      his particular tribe on or shortly after  25  August  1999  when  his
      father died.

3.    His father had had a  large  number  of  wives  and  according  to  a
      Bamileke tradition he was supposed to marry all of  them  apart  from
      his own mother.  He is a Roman Catholic and on that ground  alone  he
      was unwilling to marry any person other than the wife he already had.
       He also took the view that there were health risks for himself if he
      were to have sexual relations with a large number of women.

4.    He said that he made his refusal to accede to the chiefdom  known  to
      other members of the tribe and was immediately  detained,  mistreated
      and beaten.   He was taken  to  a  local  infirmary  because  of  his
      condition after this mistreatment and from there  to  another  clinic
      from which he escaped after a couple of days.

5.    He went to Douala where he lived and worked as a  customs  agent  and
      stayed there until February 2002 when he left Cameroon  and  went  to
      the United Kingdom.

6.    It is his claim that if he were to return to  Cameroon  he  would  be
      hunted down by members of the tribe and either persecuted or  killed.
      He says that to do as he has done in refusing the chiefdom  would  be
      treated as something akin to an act of treachery by other members  of
      the tribe and wherever he came into contact with  other  Bamileke  he
      would be in acute danger.

7.    The Adjudicator  accepted  the  account  he  gave  but  came  to  the
      conclusion that he would not be at real risk on  return  to  Cameroon
      despite what he said.

8.    The claimant has placed material before us in support of  his  appeal
      which includes a determination of the Tribunal in Fudjeu [2002] UKIAT
      07096.  In that case a person with a somewhat similar  background  in
      general terms was granted asylum.  The general terms to which we have
      referred are that he is a Christian whom tribal  custom  required  to
      accede to the chiefdom after his father's death.   He refused and  it
      was held that he would be at real risk of persecution.

9.    There are distinct differences between that case and this.  The  most
      important of those differences as it seems to us is  that  that  case
      did not concern Bamileke at all but concerned tribal practices in the
      north of  Cameroon  where  apparently,  according  to  the  objective
      evidence available in that case, the chiefs hold particularly  strong
      sway.

10.   In the case before  us  we  were  assisted  by  a  newspaper  article
      submitted by the  claimant  from  Societe,  which  appears  to  be  a
      Cameroon  newspaper.   The  article  was  helpfully  translated  into
      English.  It was about the changes taking place in  Bamileke  society
      because of the influence of  western lifestyles and also  because  of
      the disinclination of younger members of Bamileke chiefly families to
      stick to the customs that their ancestors practised.

11.   It is not necessary to cite from the article at any length but it  is
      plain from what the article says that there is a good deal of tension
      in Bamileke society between the followers of the  old  ways  and  the
      younger generation of chiefs.  Nowadays chiefs are  not  prepared  to
      marry their father's widows,  albeit  it  seems  undoubted  that  the
      tradition was that they should.  This can be for a variety of reasons
      which include religious scruples as well as  a  fear  of  contracting
      AIDS.   Examples are given in the article of chiefs who have declined
      to take up their chiefly responsibilities.  It appears that when that
      happens there is a considerable amount of disapproval but  a  regency
      is installed and, no doubt, in the fullness of time, a new  chief  is
      elected.

12.   The article is also noteworthy because it features the claimant's own
      circumstances.  It states that he would not take up  his  duties  and
      had fled.  It is said also that his wife's whereabouts were  unknown.
       The  claimant's  fear  that  on  return  to  Cameroon  he  would  be
      persecuted or killed is plainly set out in the article.

13.   When one considers the article as  a  whole,  however,  what  becomes
      plain is that whilst there is disapproval,  ostracism  and  sometimes
      even the issuing of threats against those who do not take up what are
      perceived to be their responsibilities, there is no evidence whatever
      that any violence has been inflicted upon any of those who  would  be
      regarded as errant chiefs  by  those  who  would  see  themselves  as
      guardians of the Bamileke traditions.

14.   It is inconceivable in an article of this nature, written  by  people
      who are clearly well acquainted with the  tensions  modernisation  is
      causing Bamileke society, that if such assaults were  occurring  they
      would not be written about.

15.   We can only conclude from this article that in fact the  Bamileke  do
      not carry their disapproval as far  as  the  infliction  of  physical
      violence.  We asked whether there was any objective material  to  the
      knowledge of counsel for the claimant, to the effect that in fact the
      Bamileke do pursue their former chiefs and  persecute  or  kill  them
      but we were told that no such material was available.

16.   In the absence of any evidence that harm actually comes to those  who
      behave as the claimant has we consider it would  be  quite  wrong  to
      infer from his fear that this harm would come to him that it actually
      would.

17.   We repeat, the tensions in Bamileke society are clearly matters which
      are debated in Cameroon; the article to which we have referred  deals
      with nothing else, and yet there is no indication that  any  harm  is
      visited upon those who go against what would be  regarded  as  tribal
      traditions.

18.   In those circumstances we consider that there is no evidential  basis
      for the claimant's fears of what would happen to  him  on  return  to
      Cameroon.  Accordingly this appeal must be dismissed.
