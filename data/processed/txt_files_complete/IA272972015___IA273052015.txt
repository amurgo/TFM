                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge R Calender Smith, promulgated on  14th  July  2016,  following  a
    hearing at Taylor House on 1st July 2016.  In  the  determination,  the
    judge allowed the appeal of the  Appellant,  whereupon  the  Respondent
    Secretary  of  State  subsequently  applied  for,  and   was   granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   In  those  circumstances,
    the matter went to the Upper Tribunal on 5th January 2016,  when  in  a
    decision promulgated on 9th February 2016, DUTJ  IAM  Murray  concluded
    that the judge in allowing the appeal, had failed to have regard to the
    evidence of Professor  Peter  French,  on  the  operation  of  the  ETS
    educational system, and  that  evidence  was  critical  insofar  as  it
    demonstrated that the margin of error was considerably  less  than  had
    been assumed on the side of the Respondent authority, and  the  failure
    to take that evidence into account rendered the  decision  unsafe.   It
    was upon this Tribunal now, to undertake the second  stage  hearing  of
    all the issues, and this I now do.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh, born on  28th  January  1988,
    and her husband was born on 24th May 1983.   He  is  dependent  on  the
    principal Appellant, who applied against the decision of the Respondent
    dated 20th July 2015 refusing her leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General)
    Student.

The Evidence

 3. In his opening speech before me, Mr S Hyder, appearing on behalf of the
    Appellant submitted that he would rely  upon  the  Appellant's  witness
    statement at paragraphs 7 to 10.  Second, on  the  fact  that  she  had
    submitted a City & Guilds certificate (see paragraph 19 of IJ  Calender
    Smith's determination which this has been referred to).  Third, on  the
    CAS  from  the  college  (see  paragraph  21  of  IJ  Calender  Smith's
    determination which this has been referred to).  Fourth, to pages 77 to
    84 of the Appellant's bundle, which sets out the  numerous  educational
    qualifications that the Appellant has obtained both in  Bangladesh  and
    in this country.  Subject to this, he called his evidence.

 4. The Appellant gave evidence.  She spoke  in  English.   She  adopted  a
    witness statement (at pages 3 to 8) dated 28th June 2016.   No  further
    questions were asked by Mr Hyder at this stage.

 5. In cross-examination the Appellant was asked about the  test  that  she
    undertook on  17th  April  2012.   The  Appellant  confirmed  that  she
    personally went to the test centre to undertake this test.  It was  put
    to her that the Secretary of State had  conducted  investigations  into
    the taking of that very test and  the  investigations  had  shown  that
    somebody else had taken the test.  The  Appellant  emphatically  stated
    that this was not the case.  She said that she remembered going to  the
    test centre only after having paid for the test two  days  before,  and
    having been sent a  payment  receipt  showing  that  she  had  given  a
    registration fee which she could take along to the  test  centre.   She
    recalls having paid ï¿½145 at  the  time.   She  recalls  that  the  test
    started at 9.45am in the morning, and the  instructions  she  was  sent
    were that she had to arrive fifteen  minutes  beforehand  so  that  the
    preliminaries could be gone through.  When she did attend, she  recalls
    having attended at 9.20am in the morning.  She had had her  student  ID
    which she had to show at the reception, together with her passport, and
    then she was shown  how  the  student  ID  could  be  logged  into  the
    computer, to enable her to undertake  the  test,  which  ran  for  some
    twenty minutes.

 6. In re-examination the witness said that  she  chose  this  test  centre
    because she recalls that time  was  of  the  essence,  because  of  her
    status, and this was the only available centre during that month.   She
    had already in 2010 undertaken an IETLS test in Bangladesh and she  got
    a score of 5.5.  She was asked why she had  not  submitted  this  IELTS
    test to the authorities here.  She said that  the  reason  was  simple,
    namely, that the test is valid,  but  is  then  automatically  declared
    invalid after two years, so that a test undertaken in 2010  would  have
    been of no validity now.

 7. In his closing speech Mr Norton submitted that there were  two  issues.
    First, the issue of fraud in relation to the taking of  the  ETS  test.
    Second, the fact that there was no valid CAS issued.  At this stage, Mr
    Hyder intervened to say that before DUTJ Murray, it had  been  accepted
    by the Respondent that there was no issue in relation to the CAS.  This
    is because subject to the Appellant not having cheated in her ETS test,
    the Appellant would then be given 60 days period of grace, in which  to
    find a college where a CAS could be issued.   He  submitted  that  this
    concession had already been made  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  5th
    January  2017.   DUTJ  Murray  recorded  how  the  Presenting   Officer
    "accepted that there is no merit in the ground of application  relating
    to the CAS" (see paragraph 18).  It was also accepted that this was the
    case at paragraph 26.  Mr Hyder submitted that if this was so, then the
    only issue was in relation to whether the Appellant had cheated on  the
    ETS test.  In this regard, the Appellant claimed to have  gone  to  the
    test centre and taken the test.  The inference she wishes the  Tribunal
    to draw from this is that, because she had  already  passed  the  IELTS
    test in 2010 and then also the City & Guilds test in May 2014, she  had
    no incentive to cheat.  However, she has no corroborative  evidence  to
    show that she did  undertake  the  test  on  17th  April  2012  as  she
    contends.  It is at this stage  that  the  report  of  Professor  Peter
    French becomes relevant because this postdates the case of  Kadir,  and
    what he states is that if the 2% error rate established for  the  TOEFL
    pilot recordings were to apply to the TOEIC recordings, then  he  would
    estimate the rate of false positives to be very substantially less than
    1% after the process  of  assessment  by  trained  listeners  had  been
    applied (see his conclusion at paragraph 3).  This  suggests  that  the
    error rate is very very low.   The  Appellant  has  to  provide  better
    evidence than that of a mere "bare assertion".  Finally, it is not  the
    case that the Respondent has not  been  able  to  discharge  the  legal
    burden, because there is specific evidence in relation to the Appellant
    herself that is highlighted at H1 to I3.

 8. For his part, Mr Hyder submitted that the main issue  now  was  whether
    there was "specific evidence" against the Appellant.  It was being said
    that there was documentation at H1, but this says nothing  about  fraud
    and simply states that the test is "invalid".  However, given that  one
    knows that after two years the test  becomes  automatically  "invalid",
    this does not suggest that the  Appellant  has  engaged  in  fraudulent
    activity.  Secondly, if one then looks at I2, there  is  again  nothing
    here specific against the Appellant.  The same applies to I3.  The only
    evidence that the Respondent can really rely upon is that of  Professor
    Peter French, but even here if one goes to the summary of  his  report,
    what he states is that there is a 2% error which  can  go  down  to  1%
    after the process of assessment by trained listeners has been  applied.
    However, one cannot know whether the Appellant fell within  this  class
    of cases of error.  Third, what Professor French says at paragraph 3.37
    is that, "the system identified 58,464 matches  of  which  just  33,735
    were confirmed by the listener  .........."  (paragraph  3.37).   Given
    that not all of  the  58,464  matches  had  been  investigated  by  the
    listeners, it was simply impossible to say whether the Appellant's case
    had not fallen into error.

My Findings

 9. I have given careful consideration to all the documentary evidence, the
    oral evidence of the Appellant, and the submission that have been  made
    before me today.  I am satisfied  that  the  Appellant  discharges  the
    burden of proof.  My reasons are as  follows.   First,  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State has discharged the evidential  burden  of  proof  by
    putting forward generic evidence to the effect that the  Appellant  has
    submitted a test result which cannot be treated as valid.  Second,  the
    Appellant has, thereafter, provided an explanation of  her  having  sat
    the test.  I have heard her evidence, and I have  seen  her  give  that
    evidence, and I am satisfied that, on a balance of  probabilities,  she
    is a credible and plausible witness, who did indeed undertake the  test
    as she claims to have done.  Her choice of the test centre was dictated
    by her wanting to undertake the test in that month.  She explained  how
    she paid the fee, and the registration ID that she was sent.  She fully
    recalls having gone to the test centre, and the manner in which she was
    then inspected, and taken to the computer, where she  inserted  her  ID
    number and proceeded to undertake  a  twenty  minute  test.   But,  the
    Appellant ahs passed a IELTS test in 2010 scoring a mark  of  5.5,  and
    she has also undertaken another test in 2014 which she also passed.  In
    addition,  she  gave  evidence  in  English,  and  had  no   difficulty
    understanding what was being put to her and there has been no incentive
    whatsoever for her to cheat, and I am satisfied  in  the  circumstances
    that she has genuinely undertaken the test and returned a valid  score.
    Finally, for all these reasons,  the  legal  burden  of  proof  on  the
    Respondent Secretary of State of showing that the Appellant did  embark
    upon fraudulent activity has not been discharged.

Notice of Decision

10. It has already been established that the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal involved the making of an error of law such that it fell to be
    set aside.  That decision was set aside.  I have remade  the  decision.
    I have done so on the basis of the evidence that I have heard today.  I
    am satisfied that the Appellant discharges the burden of proof and this
    appeal is allowed.

11. No anonymity direction is made.

12. This appeal is allowed.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have made a fee award of any fee which has been paid or may be payable.
