	DECISION AND REASONS

	

UPON hearing from Ms. Elliott Kelly for the appellant and Mr Howells for the respondent 



AND UPON consideration of the appellant’s grounds of appeal dated the 30 November 2017 against the decision of Judge of the First tier Tribunal O’Brien dated 16 November 2017 



AND UPON the parties indicating their agreement that the judge materially erred in law in allowing the appeal only on humanitarian protection and human rights grounds, and in dismissing the appeal on refugee convention grounds, on the basis that on the facts as found by the Judge, the appellant fell to be considered as a member of the particular social groups of (i) unaccompanied child, and (ii) a member of his father’s family, and would remain at risk of persecution in Afghanistan for reason of his membership of such particular social groups



AND UPON the Tribunal considering that it is appropriate to so order



IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, BY CONSENT, UNDER RULE 39, TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008, THAT: 



	1	The judge’s decision dismissing the appellant’s appeal on refugee grounds be set aside. 



	2	The appellant’s appeal on refugee grounds be allowed.

	

	

	Signed: 								Date: 12.9.18
