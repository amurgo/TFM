                            DECISION AND REASONS






BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The Respondent is a national of Morocco. On 5 May  2011  he  married  a
    Spanish national in Denmark.  He entered the United Kingdom on 1  March
    2014 with a family permit as the husband of an EEA national and applied
    for a residence card, as the husband of an EEA  national  exercising  a
    Treaty rights in the United Kingdom, on 14 July 2014.  His  application
    was refused on 13 September  2014  and  he  was  given  notice  of  his
    liability to removal on 26 November 2015.

2.   A decree absolute confirming  that  the  Appellant  and  his  wife  had
    divorced each other was issued by the Family Court in Bury St.  Edmunds
    on 16 March 2016.

3.   The Appellant applied  for  a  residence  card  as  a  person  who  was
    entitled to a retained right of residence as the former husband  of  an
    EEA national but his  application  was  refused  on  4  July  2016.  He
    subsequently appealed against this decision and the appeal  was  listed
    as EA/08050/2016. On 11  August  2016  the  Appellant  made  a  further
    application for a residence card as a person  who  was  entitled  to  a
    retained right of residence as the former husband of an  EEA  national.
    This application was refused  on  17  February  2017  and  he  appealed
    against this decision on 3 March 2017. This appeal  was  allocated  the
    appeal number EA/02365/2017.

4.   Both appeals came before First-Tier Tribunal Judge Geraint Jones  Q.C.,
    who dismissed them  in  decisions  promulgated  on  4  July  2018.  The
    Appellant sought permission to appeal  and  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Kelly refused him permission to appeal on 20 September  2018.  However,
    Dr. Storey, a Judge of the Upper Tribunal  granted  him  permission  to
    appeal on 6 December 2018.

5.   I found that there was an error of law  in  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Geraint Jones Q.C.'s decisions on 2 January 2019 and set his  decisions
    aside, I also reserved the re-hearing to myself and gave directions  to
    the Respondent. These directions were not initially complied with  and,
    therefore, I made further similar directions on 7 March  2019.   On  13
    March 2019 the Respondent wrote to the Appellant stating  that  he  did
    not intend to amend the refusal letters,  dated  4  July  2016  and  17
    February 2017, and rely on any assertion that the Appellant's  marriage
    had been one of convenience.

6.   The Appellant had provided a second witness statement, dated  13  March
    2018 and a letter from his ex-wife, dated 15 December 2008, but  I  did
    not need to take these into account as the  Respondent  was  no  longer
    asserting that his marriage was one of convenience





RE-HEARING DECISION

7.   Regulation 10 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 states that:

     (5) A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if-
         (a)  he ceased to be a family member  of  a  qualified  person...on
    the termination of the              marriage...of that person;
         (b)  he was residing in  the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with
    these Regulations at the        date of the termination;
         (c)  he satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and
         (d)  either-
              (i) prior  to  the  initiation  of  the  proceedings  for  the
    termination of the               marriage...the  marriage...had  lasted
    for   at   least   three    years    and    the    parties    to    the
    marriage...had resided in the United Kingdom  for  at  least  one  year
    during its             duration;
     (6) The condition in this paragraph is that the person -
         (a)  is not an EEA national but would, if he were an EEA  national,
    be a worker..."
         `

8.   The Appellant accepted that he and his wife separated on 14 April  2014
    shortly after his arrival in the United Kingdom.  However,  it  is  his
    case that they both continued to live here until their  divorce  on  16
    March 2016.

9.   Regulation 4 of  the  Immigration  (Notices)  Regulations  2013  states
    that:

     "(1) Subject to regulation 6,  the  decision-maker  must  give  written
    notice to a person of  any  decision  taken  in  respect  of...any  EEA
    decision taken in respect of him which is appealable".

10.  In particular, the Notice stated that "the appeal must  be  brought  on
    the ground that the decision breaches your rights under the EU treaties
    in relation to entry to, or residence in, the United Kingdom".


11.  Regulation 5 states that:

     "(1) A notice given under regulation 4(1)-
     (a)  is to include or be accompanied by a statement of the reasons  for
    the decision to which it relates."

12.  The Respondent gave such notice of his decisions on 4 July 2016 and  17
    February 2017 and these notices were accompanied by Reasons for Refusal
    Letters. He accepted that the Appellant had  been  married  to  an  EEA
    national for  at  least  three  years  but  did  not  accept  that  the
    Appellant's wife had resided in the United Kingdom  for  at  least  one
    year during their marriage.  In addition, the Respondent did not accept
    that the Appellant's wife had been exercising a  Treaty  right  in  the
    United Kingdom at the time of their divorce.  (He did accept  that  the
    Applicant had been a "worker" in the United Kingdom since the  time  of
    his divorce.)

13.  There was no assertion that the Appellant's marriage had  been  one  of
    convenience.

14.  In MH (Respondent's bundle: documents  not  provided)  Pakistan  [2010]
    UKUT 168 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal found that:

     "Rule 13 of the First  Tier  Tribunal  Rules  requires  an  unpublished
    document to be supplied to the Tribunal  if  it  is  mentioned  in  the
    Notice of, or Reasons for Refusal or if the Respondent  relies  on  it.
    Because the Notice of, or Reasons for Refusal form the statement of the
    Respondent's case, however, the Tribunal is likely  to  assume  that  a
    document mentioned in either, but not supplied to the Tribunal,  is  no
    longer relied on"

15.  In paragraph 13 of its decision the Upper Tribunal found that:



      "The requirements of rule 13 are mandatory. Their intention is  clear:
      it is to enable the Appellant to know the case he has to meet, and the
      Tribunal to have the material upon which the case can be  judged...the
      Tribunal is entitled to conclude that a document not  furnished  under
      rule 13 is not a document upon which the Respondent relies;  and  that
      if there is reference to it in the Notice of, or Reasons for  Refusal,
      the Tribunal is entitled to conclude that  that  reference  no  longer
      forms part of the Respondent's case".


16.  The Respondent no longer relies on any assertion that  the  Appellant's
    marriage was one of convenience.

17.  The only remaining live issues were whether both the Appellant and  his
    ex-wife had lived in the United Kingdom for at least one year prior  to
    their divorce and whether she had been exercising a Treaty right at the
    appropriate time.

18.  The witness statement of Gavin Robert Williams,  dated  5  March  2018,
    referred to disclosure from HMRC which indicated that  the  Appellant's
    ex-wife had been exercising Treaty rights as a self-employed  or  self-
    sufficient person between 2014 and 2016.  The  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer accepted that this was the case.

19.  The statement by Gavin Williams and the  disclosure  provided  by  HMRC
    also confirmed that the Appellant's ex-wife had  been  present  in  the
    United Kingdom between 2014 and  2016,  as  a  self-employed  or  self-
    sufficient person for more than a year. In his reasons for refusal  the
    Respondent had previously accepted that the tenancy agreements and bank
    statements had shown that Appellant had been in the United Kingdom  for
    at least one year prior to their divorce.

20.  Therefore, the Appellant had submitted the necessary evidence  to  show
    that he had retained a right of residence on his divorce.

Decision

(1)  The appeal is allowed.
