                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Iengar (counsel) instructed by Paul John & Co,
                    solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2.    The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal  but
in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Sweet, promulgated on  16  March  2018
which allowed the Appellant's appeal on article 8 ECHR grounds.

Background

3.    The Appellant is a citizen of India who was born on 1 March  1945.  On
24 November 2016 the Secretary of State refused the Appellant's  application
for leave to remain in the UK.

The Judge's Decision

4.     The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier
Tribunal  Judge  Sweet  ("the  Judge")  allowed  the  appeal   against   the
Respondent's decision. Grounds of appeal were  lodged  and  on  3  May  2018
Judge L Murray gave permission to appeal stating

    "1. The respondent seeks permission  to  appeal,  in  time,  against  a
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Sweet  who  in  a  decision  and
    reasons promulgated on 16 March 2018 dismissed  the  appellant's  human
    rights appeal.

    2. The grounds assert that the Judge erred in allowing the appeal under
    the immigration rules when the appeal was on human rights grounds  only
    and failing to carry out a proportionality exercise addressing  section
    117B of the 2002 Act. It is also argued that the Appellant did not,  in
    fact, meet the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  specified
    evidence of income was not provided of the financial requirements.

    3. The First-tier Tribunal arguably erred in allowing the appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules  and  failing  to  address  the  public  interest
    considerations under s.117B. It is also arguable that the  Judge  erred
    in finding that the requirements were met in  view  of  the  fact  that
    specified evidence had not been provided."

The Hearing

5.    For the respondent Mr Tarlow moved the grounds of appeal. He  told  me
that at [19] the Judge  finds  that  the  appellant  meets  the  immigration
rules, but that that finding is unnecessary and irrelevant because the  only
competent appeal is on article 8 ECHR grounds. He told  me  that  the  Judge
has only considered the  immigration  rules  and  that  his  proportionality
assessment was fundamentally  flawed  because  it  failed  to  consider  the
public interest under section 117B of the 2002 Act. He told me that, in  any
event, the Judge's finding that the appellant meets  the  immigration  rules
is unsafe, arguing that the specified evidence required  by  appendix  FM-SE
had not been produced. He urged me to set the decision aside.

6.(a) For the  appellant  Ms  Iengar  adopted  the  terms  of  the  rule  24
response. She told me that the decision does not contain an  error  of  law.
She took me to  the  terms  of  the  respondent's  decision  to  refuse  the
appellant's application and told me that the respondent has never  suggested
that the appellant has not produced the evidence required  by  appendix  FM-
SE. She argued that it is conceded that  appendix  FM-SE  requirements  were
met, reminding me that the appellant's partner's income is assessed  as  the
income of a self-employed person.

(b)   Ms Iengar said that the respondent's challenge to the decision  relies
on an argument that [19] of the decision contains  errors  of  fact,  which,
she said, it does not. Ms Iengar told me that a  fair  reading  of  [7]  and
[11] of the decision demonstrates that the Judge considered section 117B  of
the 2002 Act. She told me  that  the  fact  that  the  appellant  meets  the
requirements of the immigration rules is a weighty consideration and  argued
that the grounds of appeal are misconceived. She asked  me  to  dismiss  the
appeal and allow the decision to stand.

Analysis

7.    At [17] the Judge finds that the appellant meets the  requirements  of
appendix FM of the immigration rules. At  [2]  of  the  decision  the  Judge
correctly  focuses  on  the  financial  threshold  as   being   a   relevant
consideration in this appeal. At [12] he  summarises  the  evidence  and  at
[17] gives reasons for finding that  in  the  year  ending  April  2017  the
appellant's wife's income was �19,555.

8.    The respondent's decision is dated 24 November 2016. The  respondent's
decision clearly focuses on the financial threshold and  although  reference
is made to appendix FM-SE, the reasons for refusal  letter  falls  short  of
saying that the appellant does not produce the specified evidence. What  the
decision maker actually says is, that having considered  the  evidence,  the
decision maker finds that the appellant's partner  did  not  understand  the
questions posed at interview. No transcript of that interview is produced.

9.    It was open to the Judge to consider  the  evidence  at  the  date  of
hearing  and  to  make  findings  about  the  evidence   produced   to   the
respondent's decision maker. It was  open  to  the  Judge  to  analyse  that
evidence and draw the  conclusion  that  the  appellant's  partner's  income
exceeds the financial threshold. It was open to the Judge to make a  finding
that the appellant's partner's earnings in the financial year  ending  April
2017 were �19,555. That is what the Judge did.

10.   Having made those findings the Judge is correct to find at  [19]  that
the appellant meets the requirements of the immigration rules.

11.   The problem with the decision is that the Judge  stops  there.  It  is
common ground that a competent appeal can only be brought on article 8  ECHR
grounds. What the Judge should have done is go on to an  assessment  of  the
proportionality of the decision  using  the  finding  that  the  immigration
rules are met as a foundation.

12.   The absence of a proportionality assessment is  a  material  error  of
law. I set the decision aside but I preserve the Judge's findings  of  fact,
and use those to substitute my own decision.



The facts

13.   The appellant is  an  Indian  national  born  on  1  March  1945.  The
appellant has two children from a prior marriage. They are both  adults  and
live in India. The appellant's wife arrived in the UK  in  1997.  She  is  a
British citizen of Indian origin. The  appellant's  wife  became  a  British
citizen on 5  July  2016.  She  has  two  adult  children  from  a  previous
relationship.

14.   The appellant entered the UK in April 2014 with leave to remain  until
13 December 2016. He was granted  entry  clearance  as  the  spouse  of  his
British citizen wife.  On  24  November  2016  the  appellant  submitted  an
application for leave to remain in the UK  as  the  spouse  of  his  British
citizen wife.

15.   The appellant's British citizen  wife  has  been  self-employed  since
2010 as a domestic cleaner. In the tax year ending April 2017 she had  gross
earnings of �19,555. Her earnings have increased since then.

16.   The appellant lives with his British citizen wife. He has a number  of
medical conditions including diabetes and dementia.  He  struggles  to  look
after himself independently and depends on his wife for assistance with  the
ordinary activities of daily living.

17.   Family life within  the  meaning  of  article  8  exists  between  the
appellant and his wife. The appellants wife's accountants wrote a letter  on
23 November 2016 confirm that the  appellants  wife's  gross  earnings  from
self-employment for the year ending 5 April 2016 was �22,500.  According  to
her tax return for the year ended April 2017 the  appellants  wife's  income
was �19,555. The appellant's wife has savings in a  Santander  bank  account
of �5000. The appellant's wife normally banks her income in a  Halifax  bank
account.

The Immigration Rules

18.   In the reasons for refusal letter reference is made  to  an  interview
between the decision maker and the appellant's wife. No transcript  of  that
interview, nor any other evidence of that  interview,  is  produced.  It  is
clear from the reasons for refusal letter that the respondent's decision  is
based on the fact that the appellant's wife  did  not  understand  questions
she was asked at interview.

19.   What is beyond dispute is that the appellant's  wife  has  been  self-
employed since 2010. The  relevant  part  of  appendix  FM-SE  is  paragraph
(A1)(A)(3)(n) - which provides that the gross amount of cash  income  for  a
self-employed person can be taken into account.

20.   The documentary evidence produced included bank statements,  forms  SA
302, SA 100, HMRC tax payments and self-employed  tax  returns.  The  letter
from the appellant's wife's accountants confirms income. Tax returns to  the
year ending  April  2017  confirm  the  appellant's  partner's  income.  The
application was submitted on 24 November 2016 and was refused  on  the  same
day. It is the appellant's partner's income to the  tax  year  ending  April
2016 which is relevant.

21.   The evidence before the decision  maker  shows  that  the  appellant's
partner has income of more than �18,600 in the tax year to April  2016.  The
evidence before the First-tier Tribunal demonstrates that in the  tax  years
to April 2016 and April 2017 the appellant's partner's income was more  than
�18,600. At the date  of  decision  and  the  date  of  appeal  hearing  the
appellant's partner had  sufficient  income  to  meet  the  requirements  of
appendix FM.

22.   On the facts as both the First-tier Tribunal and I find  them  to  be,
the appellant meets the requirements of the immigration rules.

Article 8 ECHR

23.   In Hesham Ali (Iraq) v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60  it  was  made  clear  that
(even in a deport case) the Rules are not a  complete  code.  Lord  Reed  at
paragraphs 47 to 50 endorsed the structured approach to proportionality  (to
be found in Razgar) and said "what has now become the established method  of
analysis can therefore continue to be followed..."

24.   In Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11, Lord Reed (when explaining how a  court  or
tribunal  should  consider  whether  a  refusal  of  leave  to  remain   was
compatible with Article 8) made clear that the critical issue was  generally
whether, giving due weight  to  the  strength  of  the  public  interest  in
removal, the article 8 claim was sufficiently strong to outweigh it.   There
is no suggestion of any threshold to be overcome before proportionality  can
be fully considered.

25.   I have to determine the following separate questions:

    (i)    Does family life, private life,  home  or  correspondence  exist
    within the meaning of Article 8

    (ii)   If so, has the right to respect for this been interfered with

    (iii)  If so, was the interference in accordance with the law

    (iv)   If so, was the interference in pursuit of one of the  legitimate
    aims set out in Article 8(2); and

    (v)    If so, is the interference proportionate to the pursuit  of  the
    legitimate aim?

26.   Section 117B of the 2002 Act tells me that immigration control  is  in
the public interest. In AM  (S  117B)  Malawi  [2015]  UKUT  260  (IAC)  the
Tribunal held that an appellant can obtain no positive right to a  grant  of
leave to remain from either s117B (2) or (3), whatever  the  degree  of  his
fluency in English, or the strength of his financial  resources.  In  Forman
(ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 00412 (IAC)  it  was  held  that  the
public  interest  in  firm  immigration  control  is  not  diluted  by   the
consideration that a person pursuing a claim under Article 8 ECHR has at  no
time been a financial burden on  the  state  or  is  self-sufficient  or  is
likely to remain so indefinitely.  The  significance  of  these  factors  is
that where they are not present the public interest is fortified.

27.   The weight of reliable  evidence  indicates  that  the  appellant  has
established article 8 family in the UK.  The  weight  of  reliable  evidence
tells me that the  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
Rules. In SF and  others  (Guidance,  post-2014  Act)  Albania  [2017]  UKUT
00120(IAC) it was held that even in the absence  of  a  "not  in  accordance
with the law" ground of appeal, the Tribunal ought to take the Secretary  of
State's guidance into account if it points clearly to a  particular  outcome
in the instant case.  Only in that way can consistency be  obtained  between
those cases that do, and those cases that do not, come before the  Tribunal.


28.   The respondent's position is that all article  8  ECHR  considerations
are embraced by appendix FM. The fact that I find that the  appellant  meets
the substantive requirements of the immigration rules indicates that if  the
respondent had followed his own guidance, this application would  have  been
successful. That is an indication that the respondent has a  willingness  to
grant leave to remain to this appellant. The  refusal  of  leave  to  remain
must therefore be a disproportionate breach of  the  right  to  respect  for
family life. The respondent's own rules indicate  that  the  decision  is  a
disproportionate interference with the right to respect for family life.

29.   The impact of the respondent's decision  would  be  to  separate  the
appellant from his wife. The appellant's wife is a British citizen who  has
established a business in the UK.

30.   Family life within the meaning of article 8 is  established  for  the
appellant in the UK. The respondent's decision is an interference with that
family life. The burden therefore shifts to the respondent to show that the
interference was justified. The respondent  relies  solely  on  the  public
interest in effective immigration control. On the facts as I find  them  to
be the appellant meets the substantive requirements of appendix FM  of  the
immigration rules. The respondent's own rules & the  public's  interest  in
immigration control  indicate  that  there  is  no  need  to  separate  the
appellant from his wife. The respondent's rules indicate that  interference
with the appellant's family life is disproportionate.

31.   In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT  112  (IAC)  it
was held that the decision in Shamin  Box  [2002]  UKIAT  02212  is  to  be
followed and that the obligation imposed by Article 8  is  to  promote  the
family life of those affected by the decision.

32.    As  the  appellant  meets  the  substantive   requirements   of   the
immigration rules. The respondent's  decision  must  be  a  disproportionate
interference with his article 8 rights.

33.   In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT  112  (IAC)  the
Tribunal held that the claimant's ability to satisfy the  Immigration  Rules
is not the question to be determined by the  Tribunal,  but  is  capable  of
being a weighty, though not  determinative,  factor  when  deciding  whether
such  refusal  is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate   aim   of   enforcing
immigration control.

34.   I find that this appeal succeeds on article 8 ECHR grounds.

CONCLUSION

35.   The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 16  March  2018
is tainted by a material error of law.  I set it aside.

36.   I substitute my own decision.

37.   The appeal is allowed on article 8 ECHR grounds.
