Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B Quee (Counsel) instructed by Quee & Mayanja
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Sierra Leone,  born  on  12  March  1985.
    This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Keith,  which  was  promulgated  on  10  July  2017,   dismissing   the
    appellant's appeal against the respondent's refusal of her  application
    dated 7 December 2015 for entry clearance for settlement as the  spouse
    of a British citizen, Mr Sayoh Abu Kanu, the sponsor, under Appendix FM
    of the Immigration Rules.

2.   In the refusal letter the respondent concluded that there  was  limited
    evidence of contact between the appellant and the sponsor, despite  the
    couple having started a relationship on 14 August 2013 and married on 3
    May 2015.  The respondent did not accept that  their  relationship  was
    genuine and subsisting for the purposes of the Rules.  In addition, the
    respondent concluded that the  appellant  had  not  submitted  payslips
    covering the relevant period prior to her application or a letter  from
    the  sponsor's  relevant  employer  confirming  employment  details  or
    personal  bank  statements  for  that  period.   These  were  mandatory
    requirements and the appellant had failed to meet the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE.

3.   The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision  on  19  April
    2016, referring to attached evidence of travel by the  sponsor  in  and
    out of Sierra Leone, WhatsApp communications between the appellant  and
    sponsor and certain evidence of financial support.  Reliance  was  also
    placed on the fact that she had had a child with the sponsor,  born  in
    December 2015, who had sadly died three days after birth.

4.    The Entry Clearance Manager reviewed the decision but confirmed it  on
    4 August 2016, without going into any detail.

5.   The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal was heard  on  7  July  2017.
    The appellant produced a bundle containing certain documents, including
    WhatsApp communications and a number  of  loose  bank  statements  from
    December 2014 to April 2015.  During the appeal reference was  made  on
    behalf of the appellant to the birth of the couple's second child,  who
    was a British citizen.  It was said that the birth certificate was with
    the respondent as the  couple  had  applied  for  a  passport  but  the
    Presenting Officer was not in a position  to  contest  or  accept  that
    fact.  The  respondent  contested  the  suggestion  that  the  numerous
    documents now provided in the respondent's bundle had been included  in
    the original application.  The sponsor's  instructions  were  that  his
    wage slips from May  to  December  2013  had  been  included  with  the
    original application as well  as  correspondence  in  relation  to  his
    pension.  His bank statements, it was said, had also been included with
    the original application.  However, it was accepted that a letter  from
    the sponsor's employer had not  been  included  with  the  application.
    That, however, had now been rectified and a letter  from  the  employer
    dated 20 June 2017 was included in the bundle.

6.   The parties confirmed that by virtue of the  date  of  the  application
    the appeal was limited to human rights  grounds  only.   There  was  an
    issue whether there was a genuine and  subsisting  marriage  so  as  to
    establish a family life for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention
    and a factual question whether all  the  documentation  required  under
    Appendix FM-SE had been supplied.  That went,  it  was  said,   to  the
    lawfulness and proportionality of  the  respondent's  decision,  albeit
    this was not an appeal which could  go  to  the  specific  question  of
    whether the Rules were met.  That could only be answered in the context
    of the Article 8 claim.  The judge set out the evidence which was  laid
    before him at paragraphs 15 to 19 of the determination and we need  not
    go into that in detail.  Thereafter the  submissions  are  set  out  at
    paragraphs 20 and 21.  The judge's understanding  of  the  law  can  be
    found at paragraphs 22 to 26.  No issue seems to be taken with that.

7.   At paragraph 28 the judge found, and said that it was not  in  dispute,
    that the appellant had  not  complied  with  all  the  requirements  in
    Appendix FM-SE, specifically the requirement in  paragraph  2(b)  of  a
    letter from the sponsor's employer confirming the sponsor's  employment
    and gross annual salary, the length of his employment, the period  over
    which he was paid, the level of  salary  relied  on  and  the  type  of
    employment.  It was noted that the appellant's application was made  on
    7 December 2015 and the period relied on was a  period  of  six  months
    prior to December of that year.  The letter from  the  employers,  G4S,
    dated 20 June 2017 referred to income earned  in  the  previous  twelve
    months but did not refer to the level of income in 2015.   It  referred
    to a salary but did not confirm whether it was gross or  net.   It  did
    confirm, however, that the sponsor  had  been  employed  by  G4S  as  a
    security officer since 25 March 2012.

8.   It was noted that the sponsor asserted that he and  the  appellant  had
    enclosed as an appendix various evidential documents but  not  even  in
    the  Tribunal  bundle  at  the  hearing  were  all  the  relevant  bank
    statements included.  The appellant's  representative  had  to  provide
    loose statements.  The application had been completed on behalf of  the
    appellant by a Mr Ngegba and he had not provided a statement about what
    documents had been included.  Neither the appellant's nor the sponsor's
    written statements provided  detailed  evidence  about  what  had  been
    included.

9.   The judge noted the appellant's and sponsor's evidence  that  they  had
    included all the required evidence other than the employer's letter and
    that they had now rectified that but the letter still did not meet  the
    requirements of the appendix.  The judge concluded that  the  sponsor's
    explanation in oral evidence that submission of payslips would suffice,
    instead of an employer's letter, showed a lack of knowledge, advice  or
    assistance in completing the application, which was indicative of  what
    was likely  to  have  occurred,  namely  an  absence  of  the  required
    documentation.  He also considered the vagueness of the appellant's and
    sponsor's written statements and  did  not  regard  their  evidence  as
    reliable.  It was found that there were only limited documents provided
    in what is said in paragraph 31 to be "the Appellants " but which  must
    mean "the application".  These were  wedding  photographs  and  had  no
    documents relating to income.  Documents which were later provided were
    provided between February and  April  2016  for  the  purposes  of  the
    appeal.  That was found to be indicative of  the  appellant's  approach
    generally, namely to have provided  limited  evidence  at  the  initial
    application, more substantial evidence on appeal (to the ECM)  and  yet
    further evidence to the hearing.

10.  At paragraph 32 the judge noted that evidence up to  the  date  of  the
    hearing could be considered but was conscious that the  respondent  had
    not, prior to the appeal, had much evidence with which to evaluate  the
    appellant's relationship with her husband, the fact  that  they  had  a
    child, a British citizen, and that they met the income requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules.

11.  At paragraph 35  the  judge  found  that  in  terms  of  assessing  the
    couple's family life there was  a  poor  quality  wedding  certificate,
    passport stamps indicating the sponsor's travels to Sierra  Leone  with
    many visits predating the claimed relationship, WhatsApp communications
    dated February to March 2016, which were likely to have been  generated
    with the appeal in mind, evidence of money transfers,  which  postdated
    the application in 2015 and significant variations in the sponsor's pay
    as illustrated in a schedule of pay from February 2015  to  June  2017,
    set out at pages 131 to 132 of the appellant's  bundle.   Paragraph  33
    refers to this as the appellant's pay but it must  be  a  typographical
    error.

12.  At paragraphs 34 to 35 the judge said the following:

         "34. While I find that the Appellant and Sponsor have  married,  as
             claimed,  and  while  I  was  conscious  that  there   is   no
             requirement  of  corroboration,  I  was  concerned  about  the
             regular  Whatsapp  communications  for  the  purposes  of  the
             appeal; the lack of  a  birth  certificate  for  the  couple's
             second child (or even a copy, noting the explanation provided)
             and the lack of any other detail  about  the  couple's  family
             life together.  I do not find that the Appellant has  shown  a
             family life with the Sponsor.

         35.  I also do not find that the Appellant has provided an adequate
             explanation for a failure to provide documentation provided by
             Appendix FM-SE.  The couple do not suggest that there was  any
             difficulty in obtaining a letter from the  Sponsor's  employer
             for the relevant period; merely that they have  not  done  so,
             not  only  in  the  application  but  in  this  hearing.   The
             Sponsor's income  appears  to  vary  significantly,  something
             which was not apparent form the  employer's  letter  that  was
             provided."

13.  At paragraph 36 the judge indicated that the appellant  had  not  shown
    that she had a  family  life  with  the  sponsor,  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities.  Paragraph 37 goes on as follows:

         "Even had I concluded differently,  ie  that  such  a  family  life
         existed, I do not find that the  Respondent's  decision  interfered
         with the Appellant's family life so as  to  engage  Article  8.   I
         attached limited weight to the assertions about the couple's  child
         in the absence  of  a  birth  certificate.   On  the  couple's  own
         evidence, there was nothing preventing  them  from  complying  with
         Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules; they  have,  at  least  in
         respect of the employer's letter, simply chosen not to do so.   The
         requirements of Appendix FM-SE are for a legitimate  aim;  and  are
         not, in the context of  choosing  not  to  comply  with  evidential
         rules, disproportionate.  It  remains  open  to  the  Appellant  to
         resubmit her application with evidence which complied with Appendix
         FM-SE swiftly."

14.  The appeal was dismissed on human rights grounds.

15.  A number of grounds of appeal were raised but permission to appeal  was
    refused in the First-tier Tribunal.  Permission  was  sought  from  the
    Upper Tribunal and was  granted  on  9  October  2017.   The  grant  of
    permission, amongst other things, said the following:

         "There  was  a  copy  of  the  Appellant's  second  child's   birth
         certificate in her Appeal Bundle.  In  addition,  there  was  other
         evidence which was capable of establishing that the  Appellant  and
         her husband enjoyed a family life  together  and  the  Home  Office
         Presenting Officer is recorded as stating that he did not  wish  to
         make any further submission on their relationship, despite the fact
         that there was now further evidence about it.

         The First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to  give  cogent  reasons  for
         finding that they did not enjoy a family life together in the light
         of this evidence.

         As a consequence, it is arguable  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Keith's decision  contained  arguable  errors  of  law  and  it  is
         appropriate to grant permission to appeal."

16.  Before us Mr Quee submitted that paragraph 37 was predicated  upon  the
    lack of a  birth  certificate  and  indeed  that  was  referred  to  in
    paragraph 34 of the determination.  The reality is that a copy  of  the
    certificate was at page 12 of the bundle and was before the judge.  The
    original could not be provided at the date of the hearing, having  been
    submitted to the UK Passport  Office,  and  this  was  referred  to  at
    paragraph 18.  This was an error of  fact  which  was  significant  and
    permeated the whole decision as to the genuineness and  subsistence  of
    the marriage.  Mr Quee submitted that there was  other  evidence  which
    supported the genuineness and subsistence of  the  marriage,  including
    the evidence of the sponsor himself and the Presenting Officer made  no
    submissions challenging this.

17.  The  grounds  of  appeal  have  referred  to  other  matters  including
    WhatsApp communications which allegedly predated the period of February
    to April 2016.  Mr Quee did not refer to that in his submissions but we
    do not think this is material.  On the other  hand,  we  are  satisfied
    that the judge's treatment of the birth certificate is a material error
    which can be said to  have  infected  the  whole  decision  as  to  the
    genuineness  and  subsistence  of  the  marriage.   The  conclusion  at
    paragraph 6 that the appellant had not shown that she had a family life
    with the sponsor cannot be sustained and falls to be set aside.

18.  However, that is not the end of the matter.

19.  Mr Quee submitted that the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  and
    indeed before us was such as to demonstrate that the appellant and  her
    sponsor met the financial requirements.  At the  time  the  application
    was made the appellant was  not  represented  by  solicitors.   Various
    documents were submitted which were not considered,  according  to  the
    sponsor, but he accepted that the letter  from  the  employer  was  not
    submitted to the Entry Clearance Officer.

20.   Under  reference  to  pages  133  and  the  following  pages  of   the
    appellant's bundle, which was before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  these
    being bank statements, the entry showed that between January  2015  and
    December 2015 the total amount which went into the sponsor's account by
    way of salary was �14,661.48.  The pension amounted to over �6,000.  We
    have no reason to quibble with these figures.

21.  The issue was that the financial requirement was met.   That  was  what
    Parliament had wanted people to demonstrate.  The question now was,  if
    we were satisfied that there was family life and the  sponsor's  income
    met the requirements, would it be fair and proportionate  to  make  the
    appellant re-apply.

22.  Reference was made to R (On the application of Agyarko) v  SSHD  [2017]
    UKSC 11.

23.  Such an application might take another four or five  months.   Mr  Quee
    said he was familiar with these matters.  The  application  would  cost
    approximately �1,236 and the sponsor had to pay �500 NHS  fees.   A  TB
    test would have to be taken at  a  cost  of  US$120,  and  the  English
    language requirements would have to be met again.

24.  In reply Mr Nath said  that  the  appellant  was  making  what  was  in
    essence a Chikwamba point but in  reality  she  was  merely  trying  to
    circumvent the Rules.  It was not disproportionate for her to be  asked
    to reapply.  She was not being asked to go back anywhere.  The decision
    of the Entry Clearance Officer was that the documents  were  not  there
    and the judge found that that was the case.  It was not just a case  of
    there being a birth certificate missing.

25.  In further submissions Mr Quee said that this is a human rights  appeal
    and the court should take account of any evidence up to the date of the
    decision.  All the relevant material was before the judge and before us
    and the appeal should be upheld.

Discussion

26.  As we have  indicated  we  are  quite  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision on the genuineness and subsistence of the  marriage
    cannot stand and must be set aside.  We are satisfied on  the  evidence
    before us that there is indeed a genuine and  subsisting  marriage  and
    that there is a child whose interests have to be considered, not  least
    under Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Asylum Act  2009.   It
    appears that that child was with the  appellant  in  Freetown  and  the
    sponsor had visited them, according to him,  at  least  twice  a  year.
    There is no reason not to accept that.  It would  seem  fairly  obvious
    that it would be in the best interests of the child to  have  the  love
    and support of both parents while growing up.   That  is  of  course  a
    primary consideration but not the primary consideration.

27.  On the evidence before us the financial requirements are met.   On  the
    basis of the documentation provided to us it  would  appear  that  they
    were also met at the time of the application.  However  we  are  in  no
    position to challenge the findings that not all the  documentation  was
    submitted with the application.  In particular it is accepted that  the
    employer's  letter  was  not  so  submitted.   The  letter  which   was
    ultimately submitted to the First-tier Tribunal, so  far  as  relevant,
    reads as follows:

         "Mr Sayoh Kanu has  been  continuously  employed  as  a  full  time
         Security Officer with G4S Secure Solutions (UK) Ltd since 25  March
         2002.

         Mr Sayoh Kanu is contracted to a minimum of 40 hours per  week  and
         is currently paid at a site rate of �9.40 per hour.  Therefore  the
         basic annual salary is �19552.00.

         Overtime is usually available but is not definite.  He  has  earned
         �20232.10 in the last 12 months including overtime.

         Although the employee is not known to me  personally,  all  of  our
         employees are 10 year security screened."

28.  The letter, as can be seen, suffers from the deficiencies specified  at
    paragraph 29 of the determination.   It  does  not  tell  us  what  the
    position was at the time of the  application.   We  are  not,  however,
    concerned with deciding whether or  not  the  Rules  were  met  in  any
    technical sense.  For the purpose of a human  rights  determination  we
    may look at the evidence rather more  broadly  and  in  doing  that  it
    appears to us as matters stand the financial requirements are met.

29.  That however does not mean that the appellant succeeds.  This is not  a
    case where she would be sent back to her  country  of  origin  to  make
    another  application.   She  is  already  there.    Doubtless   another
    application may take a few months and will cost  the  sort  of  figures
    referred to by Mr Quee.  That is unfortunate but  is  has  to  be  laid
    entirely at the door of the appellant and  her  sponsor.   As  we  have
    pointed out, at paragraph 37, the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not
    find that the respondent's decision  interfered  with  the  appellant's
    family life so as to  engage  Article  8.   In  making  that  decision,
    however, limited weight  was  attached  to  the  assertions  about  the
    couple's child in the absence of a birth certificate.  To  that  extent
    that conclusion is somewhat vitiated.  However, the remaining parts  of
    that paragraph represent conclusions which were open to the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge and we are in any event  in  agreement  with  them.  The
    Rules themselves are  not  disproportionate  and  it  is  open  to  the
    appellant  to  comply  with  them,  if  she  chooses  to  make  another
    application.  As has been pointed out many times, Article  8  does  not
    allow parties to choose where they wish to live.  Firm,  effective  and
    consistent immigration control is plainly in the public interest and it
    is not disproportionate to insist on the Rules being  observed.   There
    may of course  be  cases  where  compelling  circumstances  exists  for
    Article 8 considerations outside the Rules but this cannot on any  view
    be said to be one of them.
