Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Z. Ahmed, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. M. I. Hossain, London Law Associates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In a decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey,  promulgated  on  9
    April  2016,  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Conrath,
    promulgated on 25 August 2015, was set aside.  The appeal  came  before
    me on 30 June 2016 to be remade.




 2. The Appellant attended the hearing but did not give oral evidence.   No
    further documentary evidence was provided.  However, it did not  appear
    that all of the documents provided with the  application  were  on  the
    file before me, and the Appellant provided his bundle of documents.   I
    heard submissions from both representatives following which I  reserved
    my decision.


Submissions


 3. Ms Ahmed relied on the reasons for refusal  letter  dated  23  November
    2014.  She submitted that the only evidence that I could  consider  was
    that which had been provided with the application.  She referred to the
    cases of Ahmed and another (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 00365
    (IAC), and Olatunde [2015] EWCA Civ 670.  The application was  made  on
    25 July 2014 and the decision was made on 23 November 2014.


 4. The application had been refused for two  non-points  scoring  reasons,
    both connected to the genuineness  of  the  business,  under  paragraph
    245DD(h), with reference to paragraph  245DD(j).   I  was  referred  to
    paragraph 10 of the  Appellant's  statement  where  he  referred  to  a
    document submitted by IT House 392 Limited (page 2 of the bundle before
    the First-tier Tribunal).  This letter is at page 6 of the bundle.   It
    is dated 20 May 2015.  Ms Ahmed submitted that this letter could not be
    taken into account as it had not before the Respondent  when  she  made
    her decision.  The leaflet which had  been  submitted  for  the  appeal
    hearing was not before the Respondent when she made  her  decision  and
    could not be taken into account (page 7 of the bundle).


 5. Ms Ahmed referred me to the invoices (pages 12 to 17  of  the  bundle).
    These  documents  also  post-dated  the   application   and   decision.
    Similarly, the service contract also  post-dated  the  application  and
    decision (pages 18 to 21 of the bundle).  As a consequence, they  could
    not be taken into account.


 6. She submitted that the grounds on which the Appellant had contested the
    refusal of the application could not stand.  The issues raised  in  the
    reasons  for  refusal  letter  had  not  been  addressed,   given   the
    restriction on  the  evidence  which  I  was  able  to  consider.   She
    submitted that the appeal should be  dismissed  as  the  Appellant  had
    failed to address the reasons why the application had been refused.

 7. Mr. Hossain referred to the business  plan.   This  document  had  been
    submitted with the application and could  be  considered  by  me.   Mr.
    Hossain submitted that, although there was no mention of  the  caf�  on
    the website, the Appellant had later submitted  a  document  confirming
    the  existence  of  the  internet  caf�  and  he  had   also   provided
    photographs.  He also provided a letter from the IT manager  confirming
    the existence of the caf�.   He  submitted  that  these  were  not  new
    documents.  The Appellant had not been given the opportunity to  submit
    further documents under  "paragraph  245DD".   He  submitted  that  the
    further evidence submitted with the appeal should be admitted as  these
    were not new documents but arose from the  refusal  decision  regarding
    the point about the internet caf� not existing.


 8. The second issue was regarding the business  contracts.   He  submitted
    that  the  letter  should  be  admissible.   The  Appellant   met   the
    requirements of the immigration rules and  he  had  submitted  all  the
    necessary documents.  The judge had not considered the documents  which
    had been submitted for the  appeal.   There  was  no  issue  about  the
    availability of �50,000 of funds.  The money was available.  Money  had
    not been credited to the business account but money had  been  received
    by instalments.  He submitted that I should consider  the  decision  of
    Judge Davey.  The Appellant had submitted documents  but  some  of  the
    evidence been ignored.


Findings and Conclusions

 9. In the error of law decision promulgated on 9 April 2016, Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Davey found that the original decision could  not  stand
    and that the  matter  would  have  to  be  remade.   No  findings  were
    preserved from the First-tier Tribunal.


10. The Respondent refused the  Appellant's  application  as  she  was  not
    satisfied regarding the viability and credibility of the business  plan
    and market research, with particular  reference  to  contracts,  market
    research  and   advertising,   and   the   business   plan   (paragraph
    2455DD(j)(iii)).  Further she was not  satisfied  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant's previous  educational  and  business  experience,  or  lack
    thereof (paragraph 2455DD(j)(iv)).


11. Following the cases of Ahmed and Olatunde referred to above, I  am  not
    able to take into account any new evidence which  was  not  before  the
    Respondent when she made her decision.  Ahmed  states  clearly  in  the
    headnote that "the prohibition  on  new  evidence  in  s85A(4)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applies to the  non-points
    scoring aspect of the rule; the  prohibition  is  in  relation  to  new
    evidence that goes to the scoring of points".


Paragraph 2455DD(j)(iii)

12. The Respondent stated that the Appellant had provided  no  evidence  to
    suggest that he had been developing his business during the  course  of
    his leave as a Tier 1 (Post Study Work) Migrant.    He had  held  leave
    to remain in this capacity since July 2012 but there was no information
    to demonstrate the creation of the business before June 2014.   He  had
    provided a service contract stated 1 July 2014, approximately  29  days
    prior to the expiry of the visa.  The limited and recent nature of  the
    evidence provided raised concerns over the  Appellant's  intentions  to
    actively run his business in the United Kingdom.


13. In his statement dated  12  June  2015  the  Appellant  said  that  the
    business "POS IT Solutions London Limited", an IT consultancy firm, was
    registered on 12 June 2014 [8].  He explained how  he  had  first  been
    involved in the business Blue Mango but the joint  application  for  an
    Tier 1 Entrepreneur visa was refused, so  the  Appellant  had  resigned
    from Blue Mango and started again with POS IT ([5] to  [8]).   He  said
    that in relation to demonstrating business activity he had submitted  a
    number of documents, which he listed,  and  which  the  Respondent  had
    failed  to  consider  [13].   He  was  actively  engaged  in   business
    activities,  and  had  concluded  other  service  contracts  with  Alpa
    Consultants Limited, [14].


14.  The  service  contract  agreement  between  the  Appellant  and   Alpa
    Consultants Limited is  dated  21  April  2015.   This  post-dates  the
    decision, and therefore I  cannot  take  it  into  account.   The  only
    contract provided with the application is the contract  with  IT  House
    392 Limited.


15. Given that the  Respondent  would  have  known  about  the  Appellant's
    previous involvement  with  Blue  Mango,  I  find  that,  although  the
    Appellant had not been developing  POS  IT  prior  to  July  2014,  the
    Respondent would have known that  the  Appellant  had  previously  been
    involved in applying for a visa in connection with Blue Mango.  However
    she made no reference to Blue Mango and  the  previous  application  in
    this part of the refusal.  Given the history and  circumstances,  which
    were known to the Respondent, I find the fact  that  the  business  had
    only been created in July 2014, and that there  was  only  one  service
    contract, does not in and of itself show that  the  Appellant  did  not
    intend to actively run his business in the  United  Kingdom.   However,
    this was only one of the Respondent's concerns, and  she  raised  other
    concerns about the Appellant's lack of business experience, and what he
    had been doing (see [34] and [35] below).


16. The Respondent had  concerns  over  the  contract  with  IT  House  392
    Limited.  At interview the Appellant  was  asked  about  IT  House  392
    Limited.  He said that  it  was  a  cybercaf�  with  around  12  to  15
    computers.  "Most of the service is to the customer on  the  internet".
    Checks by the Respondent revealed that there was no mention of any role
    of a cybercaf� on IT House 392  Limited's  website.   This  discrepancy
    cast doubt over the genuineness of the  contract  and  raised  concerns
    over the credibility of services provided for this client.  Further the
    Respondent stated that the services stated on the contract were for  IT
    Consultancy with system design and development, but  as  IT  House  392
    Limited were themselves  an  IT  Consultancy  company,  the  Respondent
    considered it questionable that they would incur an additional cost  of
    paying the Appellant's company to perform a role in which they  already
    appeared to work.


17. For his appeal the Appellant  provided  a  letter  from  IT  House  392
    Limited dated 20 May 2015.  This document was not before the Respondent
    when she made her decision.  Following the case  of  Ahmed,  I  am  not
    entitled to take  into  account  evidence  which  was  not  before  the
    Respondent when she made her decision.  In his  witness  statement  the
    Appellant said that  the  Respondent  was  wrong  to  allege  that  the
    Appellant's business and IT House 392 Limited were involved in the same
    category of business.  However, he did  not  dispute  the  Respondent's
    statement that her research showed that the IT House  392  website  did
    not advertise a cybercaf�.   He  stated  that  the  cybercaf�  was  not
    mentioned on their website [10].


18. In the bundle of documents provided to me at the hearing are copies  of
    the Respondent's search for IT House 392 Limited, including a  printout
    of various pages of the IT House 392 Limited website as of  21  October
    2014.   The  homepage  states  that  IT  House  392  Limited   are   IT
    professionals who specialise in IT support  "troubleshoot  hardware  or
    software related issues, such as hard disk recovery, retrieve file from
    dead hard disc if it shows a sign of life, Networking".  It also states
    that they carry out web  design,  web  development  and  web  marketing
    including search engine optimisation.   There  is  no  mention  of  any
    cybercaf� on this homepage.


19. On the "about" page it states that IT House 392 is an  IT  support  and
    web  development  company,  but  again  there  is  no  mention  of  any
    cybercaf�.  On the "services offered" page there is  reference  to  the
    web development service, the IT and networking support service, and the
    additional services including PC or laptop repairs.  Again there is  no
    mention of any cybercaf�.


20. I find that the evidence before the Respondent was contradictory.   The
    Appellant said at interview that he was  providing  IT  services  to  a
    cybercaf�, but the Respondent's research and check of the IT House  392
    Limited website did not indicate the existence of any cybercaf�.  It is
    reasonable to expect that the  existence  of  the  cybercaf�  would  be
    indicated on the website.  I find that at the date of the decision  the
    Respondent had valid concerns about the genuineness  of  the  contract,
    given that the Appellant had said that he was entering into a  contract
    to provide IT support to a cybercaf�, but the Respondent's research did
    not show that such a cybercaf� existed.  I  find  it  on  the  evidence
    available to the Respondent at the time  of  the  decision  there  were
    valid concerns raised.


21. The website for IT House 392 Limited did not state that  they  were  IT
    Consultants, but rather IT support.  While there might be some overlap,
    were this the only concern of the  Respondent  regarding  the  contract
    with IT House 392 Limited, I would find that it  was  not  significant,
    but given the concern over the lack  of  cybercaf�,  I  find  that  the
    Respondent's concerns over the contract were valid.


Market Research


22. In relation to the market  research  and  advertising,  the  Respondent
    stated that document provided  contained  no  details  about  what  had
    actually been completed, and  held  very  little  relevant  information
    about the Appellant's competitors.  The Respondent also referred to the
    answers given at interview relating to the market  research  completed.
    There was no evidence provided to support the Appellant's claim that he
    had visited local  businesses  and  talked  to  them.   The  Respondent
    considered that the limited information provided  at  interview  raised
    questions about the genuineness of any research undertaken.


23. I have considered the answers given at interview in relation to  market
    research (Q16 to Q18).  The Appellant said that he carried  out  online
    based research but also went to local businesses and talked with  them.
    He said that there were 80 to 100 businesses in the local area offering
    similar services but only 50% of those were  IT  based.   He  was  then
    asked how many companies actually offered the same services as he  did,
    and he said it was around 40%.  I find that the Appellant's answers  at
    interview were not particularly clear.   When  asked  "How  many  other
    businesses exist in the local area that offers  similar  services?"  he
    replied "80 to 100", but then added that "only IT based is 50%".  Given
    that the Appellant's business is an IT consultancy, it is difficult  to
    see that of the businesses offering similar services, only a proportion
    of those are IT based.  It is  presumably  for  this  reason  that  the
    interviewer asked a follow-up question "How  many  actually  offer  the
    same services as you", to which his reply was "around  40%".   This  is
    presumably 40% of "80 to 100", but it is not clear.  I  find  that  his
    answers at interview were vague and unclear.


24. The market research evidence  before  the  Respondent  consisted  of  a
    lengthy  document   consisting   of   printouts   from   Yell.com   and
    approvedindex.co.uk along with copies of some of the  websites  of  the
    companies listed.  This document is referred  to  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter but there is no copy in the Respondent's bundle.  I have
    carefully considered the documents before me, and there is no  document
    which fits this description.  The Appellant has not addressed the issue
    of market research at all in his statement.  The burden of  proof  lies
    on the Appellant  to  show  that  he  meets  the  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules and given the Respondent's  concerns,  including  her
    concerns about to the vagueness of his replies at interview relating to
    the research he had carried out, I find that the Respondent's  concerns
    in relation to the lack of market research were genuine, and cast doubt
    on the genuineness of the business of the Appellant.


Advertising


25. The Respondent also stated in the reasons for refusal letter  that  the
    Appellant claimed at interview  that  he  advertised  his  business  in
    newspapers, on Gumtree and with leaflets.  However a check  on  Gumtree
    undertaken on 21 October 2014 did  not  show  any  current  advertising
    campaign for the Appellant's company.  The  Appellant  had  provided  a
    copy of the Gumtree advert along  with  an  advert  in  the  newspaper,
    Bangla Times, which showed that a one-time advert was  placed  in  June
    2014.


26. I have considered the Gumtree advert which the Appellant provided.   It
    is a document which contains very similar wording to the  wording  from
    Soft Bliss Limited (see [28] to [33] below).   I  have  considered  the
    document showing the Respondent's Gumtree search.  This  indicates  she
    searched for POS IT Solutions London Ltd.  In  the  list  of  companies
    underneath that there is no reference to the Appellant's company.   The
    Appellant did not address this point in his statement.   He  said  that
    the Respondent not taken into account the business advertising material
    he had provided to prove his business engagement [13], but he  did  not
    address the issue of the Respondent searching  Gumtree  and  not  being
    able to find any advert for his company.


27. I find  that  the  Respondent's  concerns  concerning  the  Appellant's
    advertising were valid, and the Appellant has failed  to  address  this
    issue.


Website

28. The  Respondent  also  had  concerns  about  the  Appellant's  website.
    Internet  checks  showed  that  the  web  address  was  registered   by
    Bees2Bees,  a  company  registered  in  Chittagong,  Bangladesh.    The
    Respondent stated that there was a company with the name of Soft  Bliss
    Limited whose wording on their website was very similar to that on  the
    Appellant's website.  The Respondent  considered  that  this  indicated
    that the website been copied  from  another  source  and  not  designed
    specifically for the Appellant's business venture.


29. I have considered the evidence of the Appellant's website  against  the
    evidence from Soft Bliss.  The wording under the headings  "Motto"  and
    "Mission" is almost exactly the same.  The text under the heading "Core
    Services" is very similar to the text under the heading  of  "Services"
    on the Soft Bliss website.  In his statement the Appellant said that he
    asked a third party to develop his  website  and  did  not  develop  it
    himself.  He did not address the fact that the text  appeared  to  have
    been copied from another website.  Given that the Appellant's  business
    is an IT solutions business, and given that the Appellant has an MSc in
    information technology, it is surprising in  and  of  itself  that  the
    Appellant handed over the development of his website to  someone  else.
    I find that the Respondent's concerns were valid regarding the apparent
    copying of text from someone else's website.


Business plan


30. The Respondent stated that given the wording in the business  plan  was
    taken from the information provided on the website, and given that  the
    website was a copy of the Soft Bliss  Limited  website,  this  led  the
    Respondent to doubt the  genuineness  of  the  business  plan,  and  to
    question the credibility of the information in it.


31. I have considered the business plan.  Without  comparing  it  word  for
    word, it is clear that there are large overlaps between the Appellant's
    business plan and the Soft Bliss website.  The  "Motto"  and  "Mission"
    sections are taken directly from the website.    The  same  wording  is
    used in the "Services" section in the business plans as is used in  the
    "Services" section of the Soft  Bliss  website.   The  section  on  "IT
    Security and Integrity" in the business plan is  very  similar  to  the
    "Software and IT Systems Security" section of the Soft  Bliss  website.
    The section on "Software quality  assurance  and  maintenance"  in  the
    business plan contains much  of  the  same  wording  as  the  "software
    testing and  validation"  section  of  the  Soft  Bliss  website.   The
    "Software systems design and development" section of the business  plan
    is very similar  to  the  "Software  systems  design  and  development"
    section of the Soft Bliss website.


32. The Appellant admitted that he did not design the website but  gave  it
    to someone else to develop.  I find that this casts doubt on the amount
    of personal input which the Appellant had into his own  business  plan,
    given that large sections are copied from  his  website,  or  the  Soft
    Bliss website.  He stated in his witness statement that as  Soft  Bliss
    was a similar business, they may have similar wording  which  would  be
    "very normal".  However, the similarities do not stop at  the  website,
    but continue into the business plan.  The  Appellant  did  not  address
    this at all in his statement.  I find that at the date of the  decision
    the Respondent had before her a website which  appeared  to  have  been
    copied from another website, and a business plan  which  was  based  on
    that website and which contained the same wording.  I find  that  given
    the evidence before her, the Respondent had  valid  concerns  regarding
    the genuineness  and  credibility  of  the  business  plan,  which  the
    Appellant has failed satisfactorily to address.


33.  Taking  into  account  all  of  the  evidence  which  was  before  the
    Respondent, in particular the evidence of the website and business plan
    which appear to have been largely copied from the Soft Bliss website, I
    find that the Respondent had valid questions as to  the  viability  and
    credibility of the Appellant's business  with  reference  to  paragraph
    245DD(j)(iii).

Paragraph 2455DD(j)(iv)


34. The Respondent also refused the Appellant's application with  reference
    to his previous educational and business experience.  I have considered
    the interview record referred to in the reasons for refusal letter.  At
    Q4 the Appellant was asked whether he had had any paid work  whilst  on
    his Post Study Work ("PSW")  visa.  He replied "Actually I didn't  work
    but since Jan this year I've had part-time  job  in  retail  shop  food
    shop".  He said that he had been doing 16 hours per week.  At Q5 he was
    asked what other previous employment and business  experience  he  had.
    He replied "Well back home I was employed by an IT consultation firm, I
    finished my graduation in IT and I did masters in IT so all  my  career
    and background related to IT.  Worked for  that  company  more  than  2
    years back home".


35. I find that the Appellant came to United Kingdom in January 2007  as  a
    student.  He completed his MSc in IT from the University of East London
    in February 2011.  He obtained his PSW visa in July 2012.  He  said  at
    his interview that he had not done any paid work while on his PSW  visa
    until January 2014 when he was worked for 16 hours per week in  a  food
    shop.  Even if the Appellant had previously been employed as he  claims
    in an IT firm in Bangladesh, that would have been  before  he  came  to
    United Kingdom in January 2007.  The Appellant  did  not  address  this
    issue at all in his witness statement.  I find  that  the  Respondent's
    concerns as to the Appellant's previous business experience were valid.
     The only role  which  supported  the  knowledge  he  gained  from  his
    qualification was that from his first attempt for an Entrepreneur visa.
     The other experience is limited to work in a food shop.  I  find  that
    the Respondent's concerns were valid based on the evidence  before  her
    at the time of the decision, and cast doubt on the genuineness  of  the
    Appellant's intentions.


36. I have carefully considered the concerns of the Respondent set  out  in
    the reasons for refusal letter, together with the  evidence  which  the
    Respondent had before her at the time of the  decision,  including  the
    interview with the Appellant.  I find that on the basis of the evidence
    before her, the Respondent's concerns were justified.  I find that  the
    evidence before her  raised  concerns  about  the  genuineness  of  the
    Appellant's business, and his intentions.  I find  that  the  Appellant
    failed to show that he was genuinely intending to set up  in  business.
    As I have made clear above, the evidence that I can  consider  is  that
    provided with the application and which was before  the  Respondent  at
    the date of the decision.  However, even had I been able to  take  into
    account the letter from IT House 392 Limited, this does not address all
    of the Respondent's concerns.  I find that she had other valid concerns
    about e.g. the business plan, the website, and the Appellant's lack  of
    experience, which are not addressed by this letter,  or  by  the  other
    evidence provided by the Appellant for the appeal.  Neither  are  these
    issues satisfactorily addressed in the Appellant's witness statement.


37. In his witness statement the Appellant said  that  the  Respondent  had
    doubted the availability of funds.  Although the Respondent stated that
    she was not satisfied that the money was  genuinely  available  to  the
    Appellant, she  did  not  give  any  further  details  as  to  why  she
    considered this to be the case with reference to paragraph 245DD(h)(ii)
    or 245DD(j)(ii).  In this  regard,  I  note  paragraph  [11]  of  Judge
    Davey's decision discussing the  issue  raised  relating  to  the  bank
    statements and invoices.   He  stated  that  if  this  matter  was  not
    addressed on any remaking "it  is  a  perfectly  sensible  freestanding
    basis to reject the application".


38. However, given that I have found  that  the  Respondent's  concerns  in
    relation  to  the  viability  and  credibility  of  the  business  with
    reference to paragraphs 245DD(h)(i), 245DD(j)(i),  (iii)  and  (iv),  I
    find that  the  Respondent  was  entitled  to  refuse  the  Appellant's
    application under paragraph 245DD.   I  find  that  the  Appellant  has
    failed to show on the  balance  of  probabilities  that  he  meets  the
    requirements of the immigration rules.


Article 8


39. In the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal it was asserted that the
    First-tier Tribunal judge had erred  by  not  finding  a  family  life.
    However, in the refusal of permission to  appeal  from  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, and in the grant of permission from the  Upper  Tribunal,  it
    was stated that there was no factual basis upon which the  judge  could
    have found that the Appellant had established a family life.


40. No submissions were made before me relating to the  family  or  private
    life of the Appellant under Article 8 ECHR.


41. Although the Appellant has established a private  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom, he cannot meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)  as  he
    has only been in the United Kingdom since 2007, and he is 30  years  of
    age.  There is no evidence before me to suggest that the Appellant  had
    would  face  very  significant  obstacles  to  his   integration   into
    Bangladesh.  In relation to any consideration of Article 8 outside  the
    immigration rules, no evidence has been provided to show that there are
    any compassionate or compelling circumstances  which  would  warrant  a
    grant of leave to remain outside the immigration rules.   There  is  no
    evidence of any medical problems, and no evidence to suggest  that  the
    Appellant would not be able to continue his private life in Bangladesh.




42. With reference to the factors listed under section  117B  of  the  2002
    Act, there is a significant public interest in refusing leave to remain
    to those who do not meet the requirements  of  the  immigration  rules.
    The Appellant came to United Kingdom as a student and I accept that  he
    must speak some English.  He provided evidence of funds in his  account
    amounting to �50,000, but have no  further  details  of  his  financial
    situation.  Any private life has been established  when  his  leave  to
    remain was precarious.  I find taking into account  the  evidence  that
    the Appellant has failed to show on the balance of  probabilities  that
    the decision is a breach of his rights to a private life under  Article
    8 ECHR.
