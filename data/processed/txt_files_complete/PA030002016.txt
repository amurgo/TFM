                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Shazadi Beg), sitting at Taylor House on  2  March,  to
    an asylum and human rights  appeal by a  citizen  of  Albania,  born  4
    August 1998.

 2. The appellant had given a history of  his  father,  a  police  officer,
    having had to leave the force, owing to threats by drug gangs,  members
    of which he had arrested. In April 2015 he had  received  threats  from
    some who had by  then  been  released  from  prison,  and  in  May  the
    appellant himself was kidnapped, and taken to a warehouse where he  was
    tied up and threatened with death; but he managed to escape, and stayed
    with a friend of his father's, while his father made  arrangements  for
    him to leave Albania.

 3. On the appellant's way here, he said he was forced by drug smugglers to
    work for them. He got here on 23 August 2015, and claimed asylum on the
    24th. Because of what he had said about the smugglers, he was  referred
    to the NRM [National Referral Mechanism] for dealing  with  trafficking
    cases. The NRM  process  resulted  in  a  positive  reasonable  grounds
    decision on 13 November; but a negative conclusive grounds decision  on
    23 February 2016.

 4. The judge took great care in setting out the appellant's  history,  and
    in dealing with all the points raised. She had the great  advantage  of
    an independent report under the RALON[1] process,  containing  evidence
    obtained by the British Embassy in Tirana, which she found contradicted
    what the appellant had said. In particular, as Mr Collins pointed  out,
    records showed his father had had to leave the police in 2009 owing  to
    his inability to pass out of training school. She  noted  Mr  Collins's
    correct submission that the NRM reaches decisions  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities; but that it was for her  to  decide  this  case  on  the
    appropriate lower standard of proof.

 5. Grounds of appeal, not by Mr Collins, eventually resulted in a grant of
    permission by the Upper Tribunal, on  the  basis  that  the  judge  had
    failed to take into account that the appellant was a child when he left
    Albania, and was travelling through Europe,  and  had  applied  a  much
    higher standard of proof than  the  correct  one  to  the  question  of
    whether he had been trafficked in France.

 6. This appellant was just over 16� at the time of the events on which his
    claim relies, and 18� by the date of the first-tier  hearing.  Just  as
    there is no 'bright line' excluding any  allowances  for  someone  only
    just over 18, so there is no rigid lower standard to be applied to  the
    evidence  of  someone  not  much  under  that  age.   As   Mr   Collins
    realistically accepted, there is no requirement for judges to  set  out
    any kind of mantra in these cases.

 7. What judges do need to do is show that they have considered  the  facts
    with care, which this judge did, and not make any assumptions which are
    unfair in the case of a young person of the age in question. I  invited
    Mr Collins to draw my attention to any specific examples of  unfairness
    of this kind, but he frankly said he was unable to do so, or  to  point
    to any instance of the judge not applying the correct standard of proof
    she had set herself.

 8. It is a very good thing that there is now an  independent  fact-finding
    procedure in cases of this kind: the judge  carefully  weighed  up  the
    evidence obtained through it with that presented to her, and  gave  her
    own considered independent view of  the  case  as  a  whole.  There  is
    nothing in any way wrong with her decision or the way she reached it.
