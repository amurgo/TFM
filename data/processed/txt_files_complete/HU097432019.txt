For the Appellant:     Mr E. Nicholson, Counsel instructed by JJ Law
Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr A. McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on the 5th September 1983.
    His dependents  are  his  wife  and  two  daughters.  He  appeals  with
    permission against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Lebasci) to dismiss his human rights appeal.



    Background and Matters in Issue


 2. It is not in issue that the Appellant has lived in the  United  Kingdom
    since September 2004 when he was  first  given  leave  to  enter  as  a
    student. He thereafter held leave in various capacities, before finally
    becoming 'appeal rights exhausted' on the 21st February 2019.  None  of
    the particulars matter for the purpose of this decision. The  important
    point to be drawn from the chronology is that  the  Respondent  accepts
    that the Appellant has now had a continuous period of ten years' lawful
    residence in the United Kingdom such that he meets the requirements  of
    paragraph 276B(i)(a) of  the  Immigration  Rules.  When  the  Appellant
    applied for indefinite leave to remain pursuant to that  rule,  it  was
    however refused with reference to the 'general ground for  refusal'  at
    paragraph  322(2)  [and  therefore  the  substantive  requirements   at
    276B(i)(b) and 276B(iii)]:

         "the making of false representations or the failure to disclose any
         material fact for the purpose of obtaining  leave  to  enter  or  a
         previous variation of leave or in order to  obtain  documents  from
         the Secretary of State or a third party required in support of  the
         application for leave to enter or a previous variation of leave"


 3. The substance of the Secretary of State's accusation, set  out  in  her
    letter of the 23rd May 2019,  is  that  the  Appellant  has  previously
    submitted non-genuine documents in support  of  a  variation  of  leave
    application. Specifically, it is said that  certain  of  the  documents
    submitted by him on the 18th August 2010  were  fake,  or  fraudulently
    misrepresented the true position. That evidence  included  two  letters
    purporting to be from his employer 'HTL', HMRC correspondence with that
    firm, and a Santander Bank Statement showing salary deposits from  'HTL
    Gizmos Ltd'.   Various reasons are advanced in the refusal letter as to
    why the Secretary of State believes those documents to amount to  false
    representations.


 4. This was not however the first that the Appellant  had  heard  of  this
    matter. The allegations dated back to 2015 when his  first  application
    for indefinite leave had  been  rejected  on  the  same  grounds.   The
    Appellant had appealed that decision and the First-tier Tribunal (Judge
    Mayall) had on that occasion found against him. Its conclusion that his
    claim to have been employed by HTL was "entirely false" was  upheld  by
    the Upper Tribunal and permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal  was
    refused.  It was against this background that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    in the instant appeal made its own evaluation of the matter.  Directing
    itself to treat the decision of Judge Mayall as its Devaseelan starting
    point, it went on to find the new evidence produced by the Appellant to
    rebut the allegation unsatisfactory.  In fact it further undermined his
    own case. The Tribunal therefore upheld the Respondent's decision  with
    reference to s322(2) of the Immigration Rules.

 5. The Tribunal went on to consider the family's wider circumstances, with
    reference to s55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009,
    Article 8 ECHR and s117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002.   It found the parents in the family  to  be  familiar  with  the
    customs, traditions and way of life in Pakistan, and that with extended
    family still living in that country, there was no reason to  find  that
    there would be very significant obstacles to their  integration  there.
     The children have spent their entire lives in the UK but at  the  ages
    of 5 and 2 could be expected to adapt to life in Pakistan. The Tribunal
    rejected the claim that the children could  not  speak  their  parents'
    first language: if that evidence was true it was nevertheless the  case
    that as young children they would quickly learn it.  The best interests
    of the children lay with remaining with their parents, and it  was  not
    disproportionate for the family to relocate as  a  whole  to  Pakistan.
    The appeal was therefore dismissed on human rights grounds.

 6. The Appellant now has permission to appeal on the following grounds:

              i) It was not open to Judge Lebasci to find the allegation  of
                 deception made out  in  the  absence  of  actual  evidence.
                 Although the Secretary of State had set out  her  reasoning
                 in the refusal letter,   she  had  failed  to  produce  the
                 specific evidence relied upon, for instance in the form  of
                 letters/ a Document Verification Report  etc.  It  was  not
                 enough for her to rely on the Devaseelan findings of  Judge
                 Mayall;


             ii) There was insufficient evidence  to  support  a  conclusion
                 that the Appellant and his witness  Mr  Haq  had  conspired
                 together;

            iii) The Tribunal applied the wrong test in respect of Article 8



 7. For the Respondent Mr McVeety opposed the appeal on all grounds.




    Discussion and Findings


    Ground 1: Devaseelan and the Absence of Evidence


 8. It is trite that the burden of proof in respect  of  an  allegation  of
    deception lies on the Secretary  of  State,  who  must  produce  cogent
    evidence to discharge  it.  In  this  case  the  Respondent  based  her
    decision on two tranches of evidence.  First  there  was  the  material
    submitted by the Appellant to the Home Office in 2015.  This  consisted
    of two letters from a company called HTL, purportedly  the  Appellant's
    former employer,   a  2009  letter  from  HMRC  and  a  Santander  bank
    statement showing deposits from HLT Gizmos Ltd into an account  in  the
    Appellant's name. The second  tranche  of  material  consisted  of  the
    investigations into the aforementioned documents.  These investigations
    found, in summary, that  the  address  on  the  HTL  headed  paper  was
    inaccurate, and that there was no record of  any  such  company  having
    operated at that premises; the address held for HTL by Companies  House
    was somewhere completely different and the VAT  number  on  the  headed
    notepaper related to another company entirely.     I am told  that  all
    of that evidence was produced before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Mayall) in 2016. It was not, however, produced  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  (Judge  Lebasci)  in  2019.   On  the  latter  occasion   the
    Respondent simply  referred  to  the  decision  of  Judge  Mayall.  The
    question raised by ground (i) is whether in those  circumstances  Judge
    Lebasci was legally entitled to find that the Secretary  of  State  had
    discharged the burden of proof.


 9. The principles  in  Devaseelan  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2002]  UKIAT  702  are  well  known.  The  Tribunal  there
    addressed a phenomena arising from the coming into force of  the  Human
    Rights Act 1998. Asylum claimants who had  already  failed  on  refugee
    grounds before what were then called  Special  Adjudicators  were  able
    under the Act to bring cases on human rights grounds on essentially the
    same facts. The question for the Tribunal was to what extent if any the
    second tribunal was bound to follow the decision taken by the first:
      1. We consider that the proper approach lies between that advocated by
         Mr Lewis and that advocated by Miss  Giovanetti,  but  considerably
         nearer to the latter. The first Adjudicator's determination  stands
         (unchallenged, or not successfully challenged) as an assessment  of
         the claim the Appellant was  then  making,  at  the  time  of  that
         determination. It is not binding on the second Adjudicator; but, on
         the other hand, the second Adjudicator is  not  hearing  an  appeal
         against it. As an assessment of the matters that  were  before  the
         first Adjudicator it should simply be regarded as unquestioned.  It
         may be built upon, and, as a result, the  outcome  of  the  hearing
         before the second Adjudicator may  be  quite  different  from  what
         might have been expected from a reading of the first  determination
         only. But it is not  the  second  Adjudicator's  role  to  consider
         arguments   intended   to   undermine   the   first   Adjudicator's
         determination.
      1. The second Adjudicator must, however be careful to  recognise  that
         the issue before him is not the issue that  was  before  the  first
         Adjudicator. In particular, time has passed; and the  situation  at
         the time of the second Adjudicator's determination may be shown  to
         be different from that which obtained  previously.  Appellants  may
         want to ask the second Adjudicator to consider arguments on  issues
         that were not  -  or  could  not  be  -  raised  before  the  first
         Adjudicator; or evidence that was not - or could not  have  been  -
         presented to the first Adjudicator.
      1. In our view the second Adjudicator should treat such matters in the
         following way.
         (1) The first Adjudicator's determination  should  always  be  the
         starting-point. It  is  the  authoritative  assessment   of   the
         Appellant's status at the time it was  made.  In  principle  issues
         such as whether the Appellant was properly represented, or  whether
         he gave evidence, are irrelevant to this.


         (2) Facts happening since the  first  Adjudicator's  determination
         can always be taken into account by the  second  Adjudicator. If
         those facts lead the second Adjudicator to the conclusion that,  at
         the date of his determination and on the material before  him,  the
         appellant makes his case, so be it. The previous decision,  on  the
         material before the first Adjudicator and  at  that  date,  is  not
         inconsistent.


         (3) Facts happening before the first  Adjudicator's  determination
         but having no relevance to the issues  before  him  can always be
         taken into account by the second Adjudicator. The first Adjudicator
         will not have been concerned with such facts, and his determination
         is not an assessment of them.
      1. We now pass to matters  that  could  have  been  before  the  first
         Adjudicator but were not.
         4) Facts personal to the Appellant that were not  brought  to  the
         attention of the first Adjudicator, although they were relevant  to
         the issues before him, should be treated by the second  Adjudicator
         with the greatest circumspection. An Appellant  who  seeks,  in  a
         later appeal, to add to the available facts in an effort to  obtain
         a more favourable outcome is properly regarded with suspicion  from
         the point of  view  of  credibility.  (Although  considerations  of
         credibility will not be relevant in cases where  the  existence  of
         the additional fact is beyond dispute.) It must also  be  borne  in
         mind that the first Adjudicator's determination was made at a  time
         closer to the events alleged and in terms of both fact-finding  and
         general credibility assessment would tend to  have  the  advantage.
         For  this  reason,  the  adduction  of  such   facts   should not
         usually lead to any reconsideration of the conclusions reached  by
         the first Adjudicator.


         (5) Evidence of other facts - for example country evidence may not
         suffer from the same concerns as  to  credibility,  but  should  be
         treated with caution. The reason is different from  that  in  (4).
         Evidence  dating  from  before  the  determination  of  the   first
         Adjudicator might well have been relevant if it had  been  tendered
         to him: but it was not, and he made his determination  without  it.
         The situation in the Appellant's own country at the  time  of  that
         determination is very unlikely to be relevant in  deciding  whether
         the Appellant's removal at the time  of  the  second  Adjudicator's
         determination would breach his human rights. Those representing the
         Appellant would be better advised to assemble  up-to-date  evidence
         than to rely on material that is (ex hypothesi) now rather dated.
      1. The final major category of case is where the Appellant claims that
         his removal would breach Article 3 for  the  same  reason  that  he
         claimed to be a refugee.
         (6) If before the second Adjudicator the Appellant relies on facts
         that are not materially different  from  those  put  to  the  first
         Adjudicator, and proposes to support  the  claim  by  what  is  in
         essence the same evidence as that available  to  the  Appellant  at
         that time, the second Adjudicator  should  regard  the  issues  as
         settled by the  first  Adjudicator's  determination  and make  his
         findings in line with that determination rather than allowing  the
         matter to be re-litigated. We draw attention  to  the  phrase  'the
         same evidence as that available to the Appellant' at the time  of
         the first determination. We have chosen this  phrase  not  only  in
         order to  accommodate  guidelines  (4)  and  (5)  above,  but  also
         because,  in  respect  of  evidence  that  was  available  to   the
         Appellant, he must be taken to have made his choices about  how  it
         should be presented. An Appellant cannot  be  expected  to  present
         evidence of which he has no knowledge:  but  if  (for  example)  he
         chooses not to give oral evidence in his first  appeal,  that  does
         not mean that the issues or the available evidence  in  the  second
         appeal are rendered any different by  his  proposal  to  give  oral
         evidence (of the same facts) on this occasion.
      1. We offer two further comments, which are not  less  important  than
         what precedes then.
         (7) The force of the reasoning underlying guidelines (4) and (6) is
         greatly  reduced  if  there  is some  very  good  reason why  the
         Appellant's failure to adduce relevant evidence  before  the  first
         Adjudicator should not be, as it were, held against him. We  think
         such reasons will be rare...


         (8) We do not suggest that, in the foregoing, we have covered every
         possibility. By covering the major categories  into  which  second
         appeals fall, we intend to indicate the principles for dealing with
         such appeals. It will be for the second Adjudicator to decide which
         of them is or are appropriate in any given case.


10. These principles have been given positive endorsement by the  Court  of
    Appeal on several occasions, notably in Djebbar v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 804  when  Lord  Justice  Judge
    remarked [at �30]: "perhaps the most important feature of the  guidance
    is  that  the  fundamental  obligation  of  every  special  adjudicator
    independently to decide each new  application  on  its  own  individual
    merits was preserved". It is common ground that  in  this  jurisdiction
    the Devaseelan principles now have a wider application that the context
    in which they were originally  given.  They  apply  to  factual  issues
    beyond asylum, to previous determinations of all hues,  and  have  even
    been held to apply to findings of fact made  in  respect  of  different
    claimants, where there is an overlapping factual matrix: AA (Somalia) v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ 1040.


11. Here then Judge Lebasci was unquestionably correct to direct himself to
    treat the decision of Judge Mayall as the starting point  for  his  own
    deliberations. That decision stood as an  authoritative  assessment  of
    the  claim  at  the  date  of  that  appeal,   but  Judge  Lebasci  was
    nevertheless obliged to conduct an assessment of  the  evidence  as  it
    stood before him.  This is the crux of ground (i). Mr Nicholson submits
    that the principles in Devaseelan must now be  read  in  light  of  the
    decision  in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department   v   BK
    (Afghanistan) [2019] EWCA Civ 1358.   There, he submits, the  Court  of
    Appeal emphasise that decision makers must evaluate the evidence before
    them, and if this leads to a finding in  contradiction  of  an  earlier
    decision, so be it. Mr Nicholson  submits  that  since  the  Respondent
    failed to produce any of the actual evidence of deception before  Judge
    Lebasci, she cannot have discharged the burden of proof.

12. I am satisfied that this ground is without  merit,  for  the  following
    reasons.

13. The circumstances in BK were that a former  Taliban  fighter  had  been
    refused British nationality - and had his indefinite  leave  to  remain
    revoked - on character grounds, the  Secretary  of  State  having  been
    satisfied that he had lied when he said that he was not a terrorist. To
    prove that to be a lie, the Secretary of State relied upon the findings
    of an Immigration Adjudicator who had heard BK's asylum appeal in 2004:
    Adjudicator Hands had recorded BK's  evidence  as  being  that  he  had
    "killed and tortured people" at the  behest  of  the  Taliban.  Sixteen
    years later in his appeal before the Upper Tribunal,  BK  was  able  to
    produce the note that the Home Office Presenting Officer  took  of  his
    evidence that day in 2004. It made no  mention  of  any  admissions  to
    killing or torture. What it did say was that he  had  been  ordered  to
    "kill people at night" by Taliban commanders. The UT held that this was
    an unsatisfactory evidential basis to conclude that BK was  in  fact  a
    terrorist. He  had  admitted  to  lesser  acts,  such  as  punching  or
    harassing people, under coercion, but  the  new  evidence  showed  that
    Adjudicator Hands  had  mis-recorded,  or  perhaps  misunderstood,  his
    evidence. He never said that he had killed, or tortured, anyone.    The
    Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal inter  alia  on  the
    grounds that the Tribunal had impermissibly gone behind the findings of
    Adjudicator Hands: the HOPO's note was not 'new' evidence and  did  not
    therefore fit within the Devaseelan guidelines. It could not  therefore
    be used to displace the findings in her decision.


14. Upholding the Upper Tribunal's decision the Court of Appeal  held  that
    the Secretary of State advanced an impermissibly narrow reading of  the
    Devaseelan guidelines.
         1. I do not accept that in addressing the question of  whether  the
            finding of fact should be  carried  forward  in  that  way,  the
            tribunal is only entitled to look at material which either post-
            dates the earlier tribunal's decision or which was not  relevant
            to the earlier tribunal's determination. To restrict the  second
            tribunal in that way would be inconsistent with the  recognition
            in the case law that every tribunal must conscientiously  decide
            the case in front of them. The basis for  the  guidance  is  not
            estoppel or res judicata but fairness. A tribunal must be  alive
            to the unfairness to the opposing party of having to  relitigate
            a point on which they  have  previously  succeeded  particularly
            where the point was not then challenged on appeal.
15. Before me Mr Nicholson's submissions focused  on  the  injunction  that
    every tribunal must conscientiously decide the case in front of them. I
    of course accept, as did the Tribunal in Devaseelan, that this  is  so.
    I further accept that ordinarily, in a case involving paragraph  322(2)
    of the Rules, the burden in  proving  dishonesty  would  lie  with  the
    Secretary of State, and this could only properly be discharged with the
    production of cogent evidence.  If no such evidence  is  produced,  and
    the Respondent's case rests simply on a bare allegation  in  a  refusal
    letter, then the allegation will not be proved.   It does  not  however
    follow that Judge Lebasci was here bound to allow the appeal.  Here the
    evidence had been produced, albeit before a different judge. That judge
    had made an assessment of that evidence, and both  the  Upper  Tribunal
    and Court of Appeal had found no arguable error in his approach.     As
    such Judge Lebasci was bound to treat Judge  Mayall's  decision  as  an
    authoritative assessment of the evidence as it stood in 2016:  on  that
    date the Respondent had proven deception, and  this  was  the  starting
    point.  BK comes nowhere  close  to  suggesting  that  absent  all  the
    supporting  evidence  earlier  Devaseelan  determinations   should   be
    disregarded.   It  simply  provides  for  the  possibility,   as   does
    Devaseelan itself, that evidence in existence at the time of the  first
    appeal, but only latterly produced, can properly be considered  in  the
    second. It is not authority for the proposition  that  all  matters  in
    issue must be relitigated on the evidence before the second  judge.  It
    is in fact diametrically to the contrary.


16. The written grounds develop a slightly different point.  That  is  that
    the Respondent, having failed to comply with the directions to  produce
    all the evidence,  put  the  Appellant  at  a  litigation  disadvantage
    because his witnesses could not be questioned about it. That is  simply
    fallacious. The relevant content of the evidence in question is set out
    clearly in the refusal letter, and indeed  in  the  decision  of  Judge
    Mayall.   If  the  Appellant,  or  indeed  either  of  his   supporting
    witnesses, wished to offer a commentary upon it, it  was  in  substance
    there for them to see.




    Ground (ii):  The witness evidence


17. There were two additional witnesses.


18. A Mr Haider attested to having frequently seen  the  Appellant  in  the
    area where HTL Gizmos were said to have  been  based  at  the  relevant
    time.  This, the Tribunal found, added little to the case, since at its
    highest all that this established was that nine years ago the  two  men
    had occasionally bumped into each other in the street. It went  nowhere
    to proving that the Appellant had  been  employed  by  HTL  Gizmos.  No
    challenge is brought against that finding.


19. The second witness was a Mr Haq. I have to  confess  that  I  find  his
    evidence, and the recording of it, somewhat confusing. In  his  written
    statement of the  18th  July  2019  Mr  Haq  states  that  he  was  the
    "accountant of  HTL"  and  that  "HTL  Gizmos  Ltd  was  in  a  payroll
    arrangement with S.M Khan T/A HTL and the payments used to go from  HTL
    Gizmos Ltd". As I understand it, he is  saying  that  the  employer  of
    himself and the Appellant was HTL, but that a  separate  entity  called
    HTL Gizmos Ltd administered the payroll.   Why that should  be  remains
    opaque: as Judge Lebasci observed, it is  unclear  why  two  apparently
    separate companies would have such similar names.  Mr  Haq  told  Judge
    Lebasci that it was simply a coincidence. Judge  Lebasci  thought  that
    unsatisfactory.  Mr Haq further said that HTL Gizmos had  been  set  up
    "purely to offer payroll services": that being the case, Judge  Lebasci
    wondered, why did it contain the word 'gizmos'  in  its  name.  In  any
    event, it is clear that  Judge  Lebasci  found  Mr  Haq's  evidence  to
    attract very little, if any weight. Having had regard to  the  confused
    nature of that evidence I can  understand  why,  but  I  would  further
    observe that this was evidence of the  type  discussed  under  the  4th
    Devaseelan guideline: it was evidence in existence at the date  of  the
    appeal before Judge Mayall and no good reason was advanced as to why it
    had not been brought before that earlier  Tribunal.  It  was  therefore
    evidence to be viewed with the greatest circumspection.   Mr  Nicholson
    takes no serious issue with any of that.


20. His point is confined to this. That in 2010 a Santander Bank  statement
    was lodged with the Home Office which appeared to show "faster payment"
    deposits made to the Appellant by  HTL  Gizmos  Ltd.  The  Home  Office
    accepted that those payments were indeed made. In his grounds of appeal
    Mr Nicholson suggests that this concession having been made, it had  to
    be accepted that the payments were, as  the  men  described,  for  work
    done, or that "back in 2010 Mr Haq and the Appellant had  conspired  to
    fabricate  evidence  to  give  the  impression   of   the   Appellant's
    employment". Ground (ii) asserts that it was incumbent  on  the  First-
    tier Tribunal to make a finding on which of these was true.

21. I do not accept that the choice faced by the First-tier Tribunal was as
    binary as Mr Nicholson suggests. Its task was confined  to  considering
    whether or not the Appellant had sought to mislead the Home  Office  in
    2010. Much of the analysis made by Judge Mayall had been in respect  of
    the purported employer's letters.    If these were fake, as was  indeed
    the finding of Judge Mayall, the refusal under s322(2) could be upheld.
      That finding could stand regardless of whether the payments had  been
    made into that account by an entity called 'HTL Gizmos  Ltd'  .    That
    being the case there was no requirement for the Judge to make a finding
    that the Appellant and Mr Haq had conspired together back  in  2010  to
    make it appear that the Appellant was employed by the firm,  earning  a
    certain amount of money.   It simply had to assess what weight could be
    attached to Mr Haq's claim that he could recall the Appellant being  an
    employee. For the reasons that he gives, properly  open  to  him,  that
    weight minimal.



    Ground (iii): Article 8

22. The final ground concerns the Tribunal's use of two phrases. At its �44
    the Tribunal says this:


         "I do not  consider  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  his
         ability to continue his family life with his wife and  children  in
         Pakistan. I find there are no  exceptional  circumstances  in  this
         case"


    Mr Nicholson submits that neither of these phrases had any place in the
    Article 8 assessment made by the Tribunal. Reliance  is  placed  on  TZ
    (Pakistan) and PG (India) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109.


23. It was not in issue that the Article  8  rights  of  this  family  were
    engaged. They had all lived in the UK for a significant amount of  time
    and  had  private  lives  here.  The  only  question  was  whether  the
    interference with those private lives that would be caused by requiring
    them to return to Pakistan would be disproportionate.  Had the Tribunal
    confined  its  assessment  of  that  question  to  whether  there  were
    "insurmountable obstacles" that would indeed have   been  an  error  of
    law.  However the tests applied by the Tribunal at its �44 are not  the
    sum total of its analysis. Elsewhere  the  Tribunal  considers  whether
    there are "very significant"  obstacles  [�33],  whether  it  would  be
    contrary to the children's best interests [�32] and whether the refusal
    was be "reasonable" [also at �44].  Reading the decision as a whole  it
    is quite clear that the Tribunal conducted a rounded assessment of  the
    Appellant's circumstances and those of his family. Its conclusion, that
    the refusal of leave was proportionate, was consistent with the  public
    interest considerations set out in s117 of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.
