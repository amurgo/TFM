                                   Between

                                   Ms L N
                           (ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

               The Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                                  Anonymity

I make an order under r.14(1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any  matter  likely
to lead members of the public to identify the original appellant. No  report
of these proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  her.   This
direction applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and all  other
persons. Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt  of
court proceedings. The parties at liberty to apply to discharge this  order,
with reasons.

I make the anonymity order  because  the  appellant  gave  evidence  at  the
hearing before the First-tier Tribunal that she had been trafficked  to  the
United Kingdom. This justifies an anonymity order notwithstanding that  this
appeal was not brought on  protection  grounds  but  only  on  human  rights
(Article 8) grounds.

    This is a decision on the  papers  without  a  hearing.  The  appellant
    requested an oral hearing. The  respondent  had  no  objection  to  the
    decision being made on the papers. The documents described  at  para  4
    below were submitted. A face-to-face hearing or a  remote  hearing  was
    not held for the reasons given at paras 6-21 below. The order  made  is
    set out at para 78 below. (Administrative Instruction No.  2  from  the
    Senior President of Tribunals).

Representation (by written submissions):
For the appellant:     Mr R  O'Ryan,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  Prolegis
Solicitors.
For the respondent:     Mr C Bates, Senior Presenting Officer.


                                  DECISION

 1. The appellant, a national of Vietnam born on 20 January  1973,  appeals
    against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nazir (hereafter
    the "Judge")  who,  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  11  January  2020
    following a hearing on 11 December 2019, dismissed her appeal on  human
    rights grounds (Article 8) against a decision of the respondent  of  30
    September 2019 to refuse her application of 17 June 2019 for  leave  to
    remain on human right grounds (Article 8) on the basis  of  her  family
    life with  her  partner,  Mr  PB,  a  British  citizen  (hereafter  the
    "sponsor").

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT")  in
    a decision signed on 7 April 2020 and sent to the  parties  on  14  May
    2020.

 3. On 10 June 2020, the Upper Tribunal sent to the  parties  a  "Note  and
    Directions" issued by Upper Tribunal Judge Keki?  dated  9  June  2020.
    Para 1 of the "Note and Directions" stated that, in light of  the  need
    to take precautions against the spread of  Covid-19,  Judge  Keki?  had
    reached the provisional view, having reviewed the file  in  this  case,
    that it would be appropriate to determine questions (a) and (b) set out
    at para 1 of her "Note & Directions", reproduced at my para 5(i)(a) and
    (b)  below,  without  a  hearing.  Judge  Keki?  gave   the   following
    directions:

         (i)  Para 2 of the "Note and Directions"  issued  directions  which
         provided  for  the  party  who  had  sought  permission   to   make
         submissions in support of the assertion of an error of law  and  on
         the question whether the decision of the FtT should be set aside if
         error of law is found, no later than 14 days after  the  "Note  and
         Directions" was sent to the parties; for any other  party  to  file
         and serve submissions in response, no later than 21 days after  the
         "Note and Directions"  was  sent  to  the  parties;  and,  if  such
         submissions in  response  were  made,  for  the  party  who  sought
         permission to file a reply no later than 28 days  after  the  "Note
         and Directions" was sent to the parties.

         (ii) Para 3 of the "Note and Directions" stated that any party  who
         considered that despite the  foregoing  directions  a  hearing  was
         necessary to consider questions (a) and (b) may submit reasons  for
         that view no later than 21 days after the "Note and Directions" was
         sent to the parties.

 4. In response to the  "Note  and  Directions",  the  Upper  Tribunal  has
    received the following:

         (i)  On the  appellant's  behalf,  a  document  entitled:  "Further
         Submissions" dated 24 June 2020 by Mr O'Ryan, submitted under cover
         of a letter dated  24  June  2020  from  Prolegis  Solicitors,  the
         appellant's representatives and an email to the Upper Tribunal from
         Prolegis Solicitors dated 24 June 2020 timed at 16:02 hours.

         (ii) On the  respondent's  behalf,  a  document  entitled:  "SSHD's
         Skeleton Argument" dated 29 June 2020 by Mr Bates, submitted  under
         cover of an email to the Upper Tribunal dated 29 June 2020 timed at
         08:33 hours.

         (iii)    The appellant's  response  to  the  respondent's  skeleton
         argument in a document entitled: "Appellant's Reply to Respondent's
         Submissions of 1.7.20" dated 6 July 2020 by  Mr  O'Ryan,  submitted
         under cover of a letter dated 6 July 2020 from Prolegis  Solicitors
         and an email dated 6 July 2020 from Prolegis  Solicitors  timed  at
         17:10 hours.

The issues

 5. I have to decide the following issues (hereafter the "Issues"),

         (i)  whether it is appropriate to decide  the  following  questions
         without a hearing:

             (a)  whether the decision of the Judge involved the making  of
             an error on a point of law; and

             (b)  if yes, whether the Judge's decision should be set aside.



         (ii) If yes, whether the decision on the appellant's appeal against
         the respondent's decision should be re-made in the  Upper  Tribunal
         or whether the appeal should be remitted to the FtT.

Whether it is appropriate to proceed without a hearing

 6. In his skeleton argument, Mr Bates confirmed that the respondent had no
    objection to the Upper Tribunal deciding  on  the  papers  whether  the
    Judge had erred in law.

 7. At para 14 of his submissions dated 24 June 2020, Mr  O'Ryan  requested
    an oral hearing on the issue whether the decision of the Judge involved
    the making of an error of law. At paras 15-16, he quoted extracts  from
    the dicta of the late Laws  LJ  and  Keene  LJ  at  paras  38  and  47,
    respectively, of Sengupta v Holmes [2002] EWCA Civ 1104  and  dicta  of
    Brennan J in a US decision, Goldberg v Kelly 397  US  254,  269  (1970)
    cited by Lord Bingham in Smith v Parole Board [2005] UKHL 1.

 8. At para 17 of his submissions,  Mr  O'Ryan  said  that  "The  appellant
    therefore requests an oral hearing of the appeal". Mr  O'Ryan  did  not
    engage with the facts or circumstances in the instant appeal in support
    of the request for an oral hearing.

 9. I have considered the facts and circumstances of this appeal for myself
    in deciding whether it is appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to  decide
    the Issues without a hearing.

10. I am aware of, and take into account, the force of the points  made  in
    the dicta of the late Laws LJ at para 38 of Sengupta v  Holmes  to  the
    effect, inter alia, that "oral argument is perhaps  the  most  powerful
    force there is, in our legal process, to promote a change of mind by  a
    judge"; Keene LJ at para 47 of Sengupta v Holmes concerning the  impact
    that oral submissions may have on the decision-making process; paras 35
    and 48 respectively of the judgments of Lord Bingham and of Lord  Slynn
    in Smith v Parole Board; the dicta at para 17(3) of Wasif v SSHD [2016]
    EWCA Civ 82 concerning the power of oral argument;  the  dicta  in  the
    decision in R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 KB  256  to
    the effect that justice must be done and be seen to be  done;  and  the
    dicta at para 8 of R (Siddiqui) v Lord  Chancellor  and  others  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 1040 to the effect that it is an  "undeniable  fact  that  the
    oral hearing procedure lies at the heart of English  civil  procedure",
    to mention just a few of the cases in which we have  received  guidance
    from judges in the higher courts concerning the importance of  an  oral
    hearing.

11. I am aware of and have applied the guidance of  the  Supreme  Court  at
    para 2 of its judgment in Osborn and others v Parole Board [2013]  UKSC
    61.

12. Given that my decision is limited to the Issues, there is  no  question
    of my making findings of fact or hearing oral evidence  or  considering
    any evidence at this stage.

13. In addition, I take into account the seriousness of the issues  in  the
    instant appeal for the appellant. The decision letter contends that she
    had used a false  document  in  obtaining  her  entry  clearance  as  a
    visitor. The instant case therefore relates to an important matter,  as
    it goes to the appellant's character. Of itself, this is  a  matter  of
    some seriousness, not to mention that a decision against  her  on  this
    point may affect any future application by her, whether  in-country  or
    for entry clearance.

14. I have considered  all  the  circumstances  very  carefully  and  taken
    everything into account, including the overriding objective.

15. Whilst I acknowledge that the Tribunal is now listing  some  cases  for
    face-to-face hearings and using technology to hold hearings remotely in
    other cases where it is appropriate to do so, the fact is  that  it  is
    not possible to accommodate all cases in  one  of  these  ways  without
    undue delay to all cases.

16. Of course, it is impermissible, in my view, to proceed to decide a case
    without a hearing if that course of  action  would  be  unfair  in  the
    particular case. If it would be unfair to proceed to decide  an  appeal
    without a hearing, it would be unfair to do so even if there would be a
    lengthy delay in order to hold a hearing face-to-face  or  remotely  or
    even if there is a consequent delay on other  cases  being  heard.  The
    need to be fair cannot be sacrificed.

17.  There  are  cases  that  can  fairly  be  decided  without  a  hearing
    notwithstanding that the outcome of the decision may not be  in  favour
    of the party  who  is  the  appellant.  In  the  present  unprecedented
    circumstances brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, it is my  duty
    to identify those cases that can fairly be decided without a hearing.

18. Taking a preliminary view at the initial stage of deciding  whether  it
    is appropriate and just to decide  the  Issues  without  a  hearing,  I
    considered the Judge's decision, the grounds and the submissions before
    me. I was of the view, taken provisionally at this  stage,  that  there
    was nothing complicated at all in the assessment of the Issues  in  the
    instant  case.  I  kept  the  matter   under   review   throughout   my
    deliberations.

19.  No  issues  arose  regarding  the  Issues  during  the  course  of  my
    deliberations that I would have asked the parties to address  if  there
    had been a hearing, whether a face-to-face hearing or a remote hearing.



20. Accordingly, at the conclusion of my deliberations, I was  affirmed  in
    the view I had taken on a preliminary basis, that it was appropriate to
    decide the Issues without a hearing.

21. Having considered the matter with anxious scrutiny, taken into  account
    the overriding  objective  and  the  guidance  in  the  relevant  cases
    including in particular Osborn and others v Parole Board,  I  concluded
    that it is appropriate, fair and just for me to exercise my  discretion
    and proceed to decide the Issues without a  hearing,  for  the  reasons
    given in this decision.

Questions (a) and (b) - whether the Judge  erred  in  law  and  whether  her
decision should be set aside

22. The appellant's Article 8 claim was based, in part, on her relationship
    with the sponsor who she met in 2017 and, in part, on private life said
    to have been developed since her arrival in the United  Kingdom  on  22
    November 2015 with entry clearance as a visitor valid from  14  October
    2015 until 14 April 2016. Entry clearance was granted to the  appellant
    on her application of 12 October 2015 for entry clearance as a  visitor
    in order to travel to the  United  Kingdom  for  3  days  to  attend  a
    conference in London.

23. After making the application of 17 June 2019 for leave to  remain  that
    was the subject of the appeal before the Judge, the appellant disclosed
    to her solicitor that she had a fear  of  persecution  if  returned  to
    Vietnam. She was advised to claim asylum, and did accordingly. She  was
    interviewed about her asylum claim on 6 November 2019 (AB/133-145)  and
    referred to the National Referral Mechanism on 6 November 2019 (AB/146-
    147).

24. In the appeal, the appellant gave evidence that she had been brought to
    the United Kingdom by "the Mafia" who exploited her and forced  her  to
    work. In early 2017, she escaped.

25. Shortly after her escape, the appellant created a profile on  a  dating
    website. About one week later, she began speaking to the  sponsor.  The
    couple met twice in early 2017. In  March,  they  decided  to  move  in
    together. They live together in York. At the date of the hearing before
    the Judge, the sponsor was 65 (nearly 66) years of age. In his  witness
    statement dated 18 November 2019 (AB/17-19), he said, inter alia,  that
    he has two  adult  daughters  and  also  grandchildren  in  the  United
    Kingdom. He has Wolff Parkinson  White  Syndrome.  At  para  5  of  his
    witness statement dated 18 November 2019 (AB/18) and in  oral  evidence
    before the Judge (para 48 of the Judge's decision), he  said  that  his
    medical condition is managed by medication. In his  witness  statement,
    he said that he struggles to cope with heat and  that  the  climate  in
    Vietnam would cause him great  distress.  At  para  2  of  his  witness
    statement, he says he works 40 hours a week  as  a  domiciliary  carer.
    According to the documents at AB/104 and 107-108, he is also in receipt
    of income from two pensions, i.e. an annual (gross) pension  income  of
    �11,322.84 as at 16 March 2009 from Kelda Group and an  annual  (gross)
    pension income of �13,618.62 from Capita (AB/104).

The respondent's decision

26. As at the date of the respondent's decision (30 September 2019) on  the
    appellant's application of 17 June 2019, there was no  evidence  before
    the respondent concerning the applicant's trafficking claim.

27. It is necessary to explain the issues considered by the  respondent  in
    her decision letter, which were as follows:

         In  relation  to  the  appellant's  family  life  claim  under  the
         Immigration Rules:

         (i)  The respondent considered that the appellant did not meet  the
         suitability  requirement  in  section  S-LTR  4.2.  The  respondent
         considered that the appellant had submitted a false  document  with
         her entry clearance application of 12 October 2015. The  respondent
         noted that entry clearance was initially granted under the  visitor
         route but it was subsequently revoked in a decision letter dated 24
         November 2015 because the respondent considered that the  appellant
         had submitted a false letter of employment in support of  her  2015
         entry clearance application.

         (ii) The respondent considered that the appellant did not meet  all
         of the eligibility  immigration  status  requirements  in  para  E-
         LTRP.2.1 to 2.2. because she had entered the United Kingdom  on  22
         November 2015 with entry clearance granted under the visitor  route
         valid until 14 April 2016 but the entry clearance was  revoked  and
         because the appellant had not been  granted  any  further  form  of
         leave to remain since her entry.

         (iii)    The respondent considered that para EX.1  of  Appendix  FM
         did not apply because there were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to
         family life continuing between the appellant and her  partner,  the
         sponsor, outside the United Kingdom.

         In relation  to  the  appellant's  private  life  claim  under  the
         Immigration Rules:

         (iv) The respondent considered  that  the  applicant's  application
         fell to be refused on the grounds of suitability  by  reference  to
         section S-LTR under para 276ADE1)(i) of the Immigration Rules.

         (v)  The respondent considered that the appellant  could  not  meet
         the eligibility requirements in paras 276ADE(1)(iii), (iv) and  (v)
         given her age and length of residence in the United  Kingdom.   She
         could not meet the requirements of para 276ADE(1)(vi)  because  the
         respondent  did  not  accept  that  there  were  very   significant
         obstacles to her reintegration in Vietnam.

         In  relation  to  the  appellant's  Article  8  claim  outside  the
         Immigration Rules:

         (vi) The respondent  considered  that  there  were  no  exceptional
         circumstances in the appellant's case that would render  refusal  a
         breach of Article  8  of  the  ECHR  because  it  would  result  in
         unjustifiably harsh consequences.

The Judge's decision

28. At the hearing before the Judge, the appellant was  represented  by  Ms
    Cleghorn,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by   Bankfield   Solicitors,   the
    appellant's then representatives. The respondent was represented by  Mr
    Stainthorpe.

29. It is necessary in this case to quote from  significant  parts  of  the
    Judge's decision, given the grounds and my assessment below.

30. The Judge summarised the appellant's evidence at the hearing at paras 3-
    8, the submissions advanced on the appellant's behalf at paras 9-12 and
    on the respondent's behalf at paras 13-20. These  paragraphs,  together
    with the preceding para 2, read:

         "The Appellant's case

         2.   The Appellant's case, as it was presented at  the  hearing  of
             the appeal, may be conveniently summarised as follows.

         3.   The Appellant was born and raised in  Vietnam.  The  Appellant
             was brought to the UK by the  Mafia,  who  exploited  her  and
             forced her to work. She was made to work on what the Appellant
             describes as a farm, and  she  lived  in  the  basement  of  a
             warehouse. In early 2017, the Appellant managed to escape.

         4.   The Appellant escaped and ran away. She did not know where she
             was, but simply tried  to  escape.  Shortly  after  this,  the
             Appellant registered a profile on dating  website  and  around
             one week later, began speaking to [the sponsor], her partner.

         5.   The couple met twice in early 2017, and in March of  the  same
             year decided to move  in  together.  The  couple  continue  to
             reside together in York.

         6.   The couple have a strong and subsisting relationship  and  the
             Appellant made an application for leave to remain in the UK on
             that basis.

         7.   It would not be possible for the Appellant and her partner  to
             continue  their  relationship  in  Vietnam.  The   Appellant's
             partner works as a carer in the  UK,  and  also  suffers  from
             health problems that would make it very difficult for  him  to
             live in Vietnam. It would also take him away from his  family,
             to whom he is very close.

         8.   Following the refusal of the  human  rights  application,  the
             Appellant disclosed to her solicitor that she had  a  fear  of
             persecution if returned to Vietnam. The Appellant was  advised
             to claim asylum, and did accordingly. The Appellant says  that
             she did not provide details of the Mafia or  of  her  fear  of
             return previously as she was scared.

         9.   In submissions, Ms Cleghorn, argued that the  actions  of  the
             Appellant  should  be  viewed  from  the  perspective  of   an
             individual that  has  suffered  trauma  as  a  result  of  her
             experience of being trafficked to the UK. The  fact  that  the
             Appellant did not disclose details about the mafia earlier  is
             indicative of  someone  that  has  been  through  a  traumatic
             experience.

         10.  With regards to the relationship between the Appellant and her
             partner, Ms Cleghorn argues that they have both provided  open
             and candid evidence about how they met. She asks that  I  find
             their evidence credible. She referred me to  the  evidence  in
             the bundle to demonstrate that the couple are  cohabiting  and
             have an ongoing relationship.

         11.  Ms Cleghorn argued that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles
             that  would  prevent  this  relationship  from  continuing  in
             Vietnam. The Appellant's partner is 65, and is a father figure
             to his grandchildren. Relocating to  Vietnam  would  take  him
             away from his family. Furthermore, he would struggle  to  cope
             in Vietnam because of his health problems.

         12.  Ms Cleghorn asks that I allow the appeal.

         The Respondent's Case

         13.  The Respondent's case, can be  conveniently  summarised  as  a
             follows.

         14.  It is accepted that the Appellant is a citizen of Vietnam.  It
             is also accepted that the Appellant has  a  relationship  with
             her partner, [the sponsor].

         15.   However,  the  Appellant  does  not  meet   the   Suitability
             requirements of the Immigration Rules, on the basis  that  she
             used  false  documents  as  part  of   her   entry   clearance
             application in 2015.

         16.  It is also  argued  that  the  Appellant  does  not  meet  the
             Immigration Status requirement of the Rules, as the  Appellant
             has not had any leave in the UK since her entry clearance  was
             revoked.

         17.  In submissions, Mr Stainthorpe,  relied  on  the  reasons  for
             refusal letter. He argued that the Appellant's claims to  have
             been trafficked to the UK are not credible.

         18.  With regards to the  relationship,  he  argues  that  although
             there is likely to be some disruption to the relationship, the
             Appellant   has   failed   to   establish   that   there   are
             insurmountable obstacles that would prevent their relationship
             from continuing outside the UK.

         19.  The Respondent also argues that the Appellant's case does  not
             give rise to any exceptional circumstances.

         20.  Mr Stainthorpe asks that I dismiss the appeal."

31. The  Judge  then  directed  himself  concerning  the  applicable  legal
    framework at paras 21-23, saying at para 23 as follows:

         "23. The burden of proving the primary facts is upon the  Appellant
             and the standard is  on  the  balance  of  probabilities.  The
             Tribunal may have regard to any matter, including one  arising
             after the decision, if it is relevant to the substance of  the
             appealed decision (section 85(4))."

32. At para 27, the Judge said that he wished  to  emphasise  that  he  had
    considered all of the evidence in arriving at his conclusions.

33. At paras 28-30, the Judge said as follows:

         "Preliminary Issue

         28.  Upon my reading of the papers, I noted that the Appellant  has
             now made a claim for asylum whilst the present appeal has been
             ongoing. There has also been a  referral  under  the  National
             Referral Mechanism to investigate whether  the  Appellant  has
             been a victim of trafficking.

         29.   With  that  in  mind,  I   raised   this   point   with   the
             representatives during initial discussions and  the  potential
             impact of my findings in this case. I provided Ms Cleghorn  an
             opportunity to discuss the matter with the Appellant and those
             [pic]instructing her. On return, Ms  Cleghorn  confirmed  that
             her instructions were that the  Appellant  wished  to  proceed
             with this appeal.

         30.  I therefore confirmed  that  the  appeal  would  proceed,  but
             reminded Ms Cleghorn  that  she  could  advance  arguments  in
             relation to her human rights claim and not in [pic]relation to
             a protection claim."

34. At para 31, the Judge said that accepted that  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor had co-habited for more than 2 years and were in a relationship
    together.  At para 32, he said that he  found  the  sponsor  to  be  "a
    truthful and reliable witness who had no  apparent  motive  to  mislead
    me". However, he said that he did  not  find  the  appellant  to  be  a
    truthful and reliable witness "for the reasons  set  out  below".   The
    Judge then proceeded to give his reasons at paras 33-38, concluding  at
    para 39 as follows:

         "39. In  summary,  I  find  that  the  Appellant  has  provided  an
             inconsistent and incredible account. I do not accept that  the
             Appellant is a witness of truth. To the contrary, it is  clear
             to me that the Appellant has deliberately withheld information
             and has provided a fabricated  account  of  her  circumstances
             since arrival in the UK, and this has not stood up to scrutiny
             when subjected to questioning."

35. In giving his reasons at paras  33-38,  it  is  clear  that  the  Judge
    engaged with the evidence that the appellant had  given  that  she  had
    been trafficked to the United Kingdom, in particular, her evidence that
    she had escaped from "the Mafia" and her evidence of  the  events  that
    followed. For example:

         "34. ... I do not find it credible that, if the Appellant was  held
             against her will and forced to work as she  claims,  that  the
             same people would have given the Appellant  her  passport  and
             documents or given her such easy access to them."

         35.  ... despite being asked a number of times, the  Appellant  was
             unable to provide even the most basic detail  in  relation  to
             the names of towns or areas through which she travelled  after
             her escape. The Appellant's explanation is that  she  did  not
             understand  English.  That  may  have   been   an   acceptable
             explanation, had it not  been  the  case  that  following  her
             escape, the Appellant managed to purchase a  smart  phone  and
             register herself on a dating website, through which she  later
             met her partner.

         37.  ... The Appellant claims that  the  mafia  have  made  serious
             threats against her and her family, including threats  against
             her son. However, despite the serious nature of  the  threats,
             the Appellant admitted  in  her  evidence  that  she  has  not
             disclosed these to her family. One would expect  that  if  the
             Appellant had received such threats against  her  family,  she
             would have at least made them aware so that  they  could  take
             appropriate  precautions   or   take   measures   to   protect
             themselves."

36. In relation to the appellant's Article 8 claim outside the  Immigration
    Rules, the Judge set out at para 40 of his  decision  the  step-by-step
    approach explained at para 17 of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27. He  then  said,
    at para 41, that he was satisfied that  the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and the sponsor amounted to family life; at para 42, that the
    respondent's decision was taken  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration
    Rules and was thus in accordance with the law; and at para 43, that the
    respondent's decision was also taken in pursuance of the legitimate aim
    of maintaining the  economic  wellbeing  of  the  country  through  the
    consistent  application  of  immigration  controls.  The   Judge   then
    considered proportionality at paras 44-48, concluding, at para 49, that
    the respondent's decision was proportionate. He  gave  his  reasons  at
    paras 44-48 which read:

         "44. The remaining question is whether the decision  to  refuse  is
             proportionate to that end. Having taken into  account  all  of
             the circumstances of the case, as presented at the hearing and
             in the documents, I find that  the  Respondent's  decision  is
             proportionate, for the following reasons.

         45.  The Appellant does not meet the Rules, as discussed above, and
             this must be a weighty factor in considering  proportionality.
             There is a clear public interest in the  Rules  being  applied
             consistently for  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
             control.

         46.  Although the Appellant and her partner are in a  relationship,
             I am mindful that this was formed  and  developed  whilst  the
             Appellant  had  been  resident  in  the  UK   unlawfully.   In
             accordance with section 117B (4), I attach  little  weight  to
             the relationship as a result.

         47.  I also note that whilst the Appellant has a partner in the UK,
             she also has close and significant family members in  Vietnam,
             including of course her young son

         48.  I accept the evidence that  [the  sponsor]  has  children  and
             grandchildren in the UK and also suffers from health problems.
             I  accept  that  he  would  experience  some   difficulty   in
             relocating to Vietnam if he chose to  do  so,  but  I  do  not
             accept that this would amount to insurmountable  obstacles  or
             result in unjustifiably harsh consequences. [The sponsor]  has
             a significant pension income, upon which he could rely  should
             he choose to relocate or travel between the  UK  and  Vietnam.
             Although he has medical conditions, he confirmed  in  evidence
             before me that those were managed by medication."

The grounds

37. Following the dismissal  of  her  appeal,  the  appellant  changed  her
    representatives. Her application for permission to appeal was lodged by
    Prolegis Solicitors and her grounds of appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    were settled by Mr O'Ryan.

38. There are four grounds set  out  in  the  appellant's  application  for
    permission to appeal which are set out under headings which I  did  not
    find entirely helpful, especially with regard to the heading for ground
    1. I have instead  focused  on  the  submissions  advanced  under  each
    heading which I summarise as follows:

         (i)  Ground 1: It is not clear what issues the Judge considered  he
         had before him for determination.  The  Judge's  purported  adverse
         findings at paras 33-39 were  a  nullity  because  the  appellant's
         protection claim constituted a "new matter" in respect of which the
         respondent's consent had not been obtained as was required pursuant
         to s.85)(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.
         Furthermore, it was not entirely clear what relevance  the  Judge's
         adverse  findings  at  paras  33-39  had   in   relation   to   his
         determination of the appeal. Nevertheless,  the  reader  cannot  be
         assured that the Judge's negative credibility findings did not have
         a negative bearing on the Judge's overall proportionality balancing
         exercise.

         (ii) Ground 2: It was unclear on what basis the Judge was  able  to
         say at para 45 that "the appellant does  not  meet  the  rules,  as
         discussed above, ...". The Judge failed to give any reasons at  all
         for finding that the appellant did not meet the Immigration  Rules.
         The Judge failed to make a finding on  whether  the  appellant  had
         used a false document and therefore did not satisfy the suitability
         requirements of the Immigration Rules, although he  said,  at  para
         45, that "the appellant does  not  meet  the  rules,  as  discussed
         above". In the alternative, if the Judge  simply  adopted,  without
         the more, the  respondent's  position,  then  the  Judge  erred  as
         follows:

             (a)  He failed  to  give  any  or  any  adequate  reasons  for
             accepting the respondent's position  that  the  appellant  had
             used a false document.

             (b)  He failed to note that the Immigration Rules in  Appendix
             FM set out  three  categories  of  wrongdoing  which  were  of
             decreasing seriousness, with  different  consequences  ranging
             from mandatory refusal to refusal being the normal  course  to
             the possibility that an application "may" be refused.

             (c)  In that regard, he was obliged to consider  the  exercise
             of discretion but he failed to do so.

             (d)  He failed to consider the appellant's evidence  that,  if
             false documents were submitted, this had  been  done  by  "the
             Mafia".

         (iii)    Ground 3: The Judge failed to take into account a material
         consideration in the proportionality balancing exercise, i.e.  that
         the appellant's then representatives (Bankfield  Heath  Solicitors)
         had asserted in their letter dated 18 June  2019  accompanying  her
         application for leave to  remain  that  the  sponsor  was  able  to
         financially support the appellant, having  an  annual  income  over
         �18,600 and that it would  not  be  proportionate  to  require  the
         appellant to leave the United Kingdom in order  to  make  an  entry
         clearance application. The grounds draw attention to the fact  that
         financial evidence was provided by the appellant at  pages  101-107
         of her bundle. The Judge failed to consider Chikwamba v SSHD [2008]
         UKHL 40 and SSHD v Hayat (Pakistan) [2012] EWCA Civ 1054.

         (iv) Ground 4: The Judge gave inadequate reasons  for  his  finding
         that there were no insurmountable obstacles to family life  between
         the appellant and the sponsor being enjoyed in Vietnam.

39. In relation to ground 4, the permission judge said  that  it  was  also
    arguable, in light of the judgment in Lal v SSHD [2019] EWCA  Civ  1925
    (the citation for which was helpfully provided  by  Mr  O'Ryan  in  his
    submissions dated 24 June 2020), that the Judge failed to give adequate
    reasons for the finding that the appellant's  British  citizen  partner
    could relocate with her to Vietnam.

Submissions

40. I shall deal with the submissions of Mr  O'Ryan  and  Mr  Bates  in  my
    assessment below, to the extent that I consider it necessary to do so.



Assessment

41. Before turning to ground 1, it is relevant for me to say  that  appeals
    brought in relation to Article 8 of the ECHR  do,  on  occasion,  raise
    issues which ought to be subject of a protection claim  but  which  the
    individual nevertheless decides to pursue in the context of  Article  8
    instead of pursuing an asylum claim  or  in  addition  to  pursuing  an
    asylum claim. There is nothing to prevent appellants from relying  upon
    matters that ought to be the subject of a protection claim  in  support
    of their Article 8 claim in an appeal, albeit that it would be  prudent
    for them to bear in mind that the standard  of  proof  in  relation  to
    Article 8 is the balance of probabilities.

42. It is now appropriate to look at paras 1-6 of the  appellant's  witness
    statement dated 18 November 2019 (AB/13-15) which read:

         "1.  I ... make this statement in support of my appeal against  the
             decision of the Secretary of State for the Home Department  to
             refuse my application for leave to remain as  the  partner  of
             [the sponsor].

         2.   I have recently claimed asylum in the UK because I  am  scared
             to return to Vietnam. I have been scared to return to  Vietnam
             since I escaped from the Vietnamese Mafia here in the UK but I
             did not tell the Home Office about this before because  I  was
             scared to say anything. The Mafia gang constantly told me  bad
             things about the police in this  country.  If  I  go  back  to
             Vietnam then I am scared that the Mafia who forced me to  come
             to this country will kill me because I escaped from  them  and
             have not paid off the debt.

         3.   I had a meeting with my solicitor on 21 October 2019.  At  the
             appointment I told my solicitor why I was scared to go back to
             Vietnam. My solicitor told me that I should claim  asylum.  My
             solicitor helped me to call the Home Office on the same day to
             tell them I wanted to claim asylum.

         4.   As I explained to the Home Office when I went  to  Croydon  to
             claim asylum, I was  forced  to  come  to  the  UK  because  I
             borrowed money from people in Vietnam which I  could  not  pay
             back. When I arrived in the UK I was  taken  to  a  place  and
             forced to grow plants. I was forced to do this for over a year
             before I managed to escape.

         5.   I understand that this appeal however is not about  my  asylum
             claim. I understand that this appeal will deal with whether  I
             should be granted leave to remain as [the sponsor's] partner.

         6.   One of the reasons the Home Office has refused my  application
             is that they say that  I  submitted  false  documents  when  I
             applied for my visa a few years ago. I want to say that I  had
             nothing to do with that visa application. I  did  not  prepare
             it. I just did what the  Mafia  people  told  me  to  do.  The
             application was prepared by the Mafia people who brought me to
             the UK. If any false documents were submitted then I am  sorry
             but it was the Mafia who did this."

43. It is therefore  clear  from  the  appellant's  witness  statement,  in
    particular para 6, that her  trafficking  claim  was  relevant  to  her
    explanation concerning the  employment  letter  she  had  submitted  in
    support  of  her   entry   clearance   application.   The   appellant's
    explanation, which was linked to her trafficking claim,  was  therefore
    plainly an issue that had to be considered by the Judge.

44. Ground 1 assumes that the Judge  considered  the  appellant's  evidence
    that she had been trafficked as a protection claim. It may well be that
    this is a misconception that is attributable to the fact that Mr O'Ryan
    did not appear before the Judge and Prolegis Solicitors were not acting
    for the appellant at the date of the hearing.

45. I reject the submission that the  Judge's  assessment  at  paras  33-39
    concerned his assessment of her protection claim, for the reasons given
    below. It is clear, in my judgment, that he considered it  as  part  of
    her Article 8 claim, for the reasons given below. For the same reasons,
    I reject the submission at para 22  of  the  grounds  (in  relation  to
    ground 2) that the Judge failed to consider the appellant's explanation
    for the submission of a false  employment  letter  in  her  2015  entry
    clearance application. My reasons are as follows:

         (i)  The Judge had before him the  appellant's  witness  statement,
         paras 1-6 of which made it clear she understood that her protection
         claim was separate from her Article 8 claim and that she understood
         that the hearing before the Judge concerned  her  Article  8  claim
         only. She then advanced an explanation to address the fact that her
         application for leave to remain had  been  refused  on  suitability
         grounds.

         (ii) It is clear from paras 28-30  of  the  Judge's  decision  that
         there was some discussion about the fact  that  the  appellant  had
         made an asylum claim. It is clear from para 30 that the Judge  made
         it clear to  Ms  Cleghorn  that  she  could  advance  arguments  in
         relation to the appellant's human rights claim but in relation to a
         protection claim.

         (iii)     This  was  plainly  the  correct  approach  because   the
         appellant's grounds of appeal  to  the  FtT  did  not  include  any
         protection ground. This is because sections  d.1  and  d.2  of  the
         appellant's form IAFT-5 were left blank. Only section  d.3  of  the
         form was completed and this referred only to Article 8, and not  to
         any protection claim. There was no application before the Judge for
         the grounds of appeal to be amended so as to include any asylum  or
         humanitarian protection ground.

         (iv) At para 1 of his decision, the Judge  set  the  scope  of  the
         appeal as an appeal that concerns the appellant's right to  respect
         for her private and family life under Article 8.

         (v)  At  para  17  of  his  decision,  the  Judge  referred  to  Mr
         Stainthorpe's  submission  on  the  respondent's  behalf  that  the
         appellant's claims to have  been  trafficked  to  the  UK  are  not
         credible.

         (vi) At para 4 of his submissions dated 6 July 2020, Mr O'Ryan said
         that the appellant does not object to the Upper Tribunal  admitting
         Mr Stainthorpe's  post-hearing  minute  into  evidence  under  Rule
         15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008.  At
         para  5  of  his  skeleton  argument,  Mr  Bates  quotes  from   Mr
         Stainthorpe's post-minute record which states:

             "I did maintain suitability, on apps  [pic]account  fraud  was
             used in her visa application (although she says this  was  the
             mafia  trafficking  her),  I  asked  for  suitability  to   be
             considered in the context of her (untruthful) evidence today."

         (vii)    At para 50 of his decision, the Judge dismissed the appeal
         on human rights grounds. There is no mention  of  any  decision  on
         asylum grounds or humanitarian protection grounds.

         (viii)   The Judge's self-direction on the law at paras  21-23  and
         40 only relates to Article 8.

         (ix)  At  para  15,  the  Judge  recorded  the  submissions  of  Mr
         Stainthorpe that  the  appellant  does  not  meet  the  suitability
         requirement of the Immigration Rules on the basis that she had used
         false documents as part of her entry clearance in 2015.

         (x)  At para 45, the Judge said: "The appellant does not  meet  the
         Rules, as discussed above, ..."

         (xi) Taking all of the above into account, I have  concluded  that,
         on any legitimate view, para 45 of the Judge's decision could  only
         relate to his assessment at paras 33-39 and that his assessment  at
         paras  33-39  could  only  be  in  relation  to   the   appellant's
         explanation for the submission of the employment  letter  with  her
         entry clearance application. He found her  evidence  that  she  had
         been trafficked to be lacking in credibility and  therefore  found,
         implicitly,  that  her  explanation  for  the  submission  of   the
         employment letter to be lacking in credibility.

46. I accept that the Judge did not state in terms that the reason  why  he
    considered the appellant's credibility in relation to her evidence that
    she had been trafficked was because he had to  assess  her  explanation
    for the submission of  the  false  employment  letter  with  her  entry
    clearance application. It would have been preferable if he had done so.
    Nevertheless, it is implicit, on any legitimate view, that that is  the
    reason why he did so, for the reasons given above.

47. I therefore reject para 22 of the  grounds  (advanced  in  relation  to
    ground  2)  that  the  Judge  failed  to   consider   the   appellant's
    explanation. He did consider it. He rejected her explanation.

48. Ground 1 correctly states that there was  a  "new  matter"  before  the
    Judge but not for the reason advanced in ground 1. As I have  explained
    above, the Judge did  not  decide  the  appellant's  protection  claim.
    However, the appellant's evidence that she had  been  trafficked  which
    she advanced as the background to her  explanation  that  it  was  "the
    Mafia" who had submitted the  employment  letter  if  it  was  a  false
    document did  constitute  a  "new  matter"  in  respect  of  which  the
    respondent's consent was required.

49. In this regard, Mr Bates quotes the  following  from  the  post-hearing
    minute of Mr Stainthorpe:

         "I had asylum and trafficking claim  dumped  on  me  yet  rep  (who
         sought advice during a 5 min break) and maintained her instructions
         were to proceed despite IJ and myself saying that we would have  to
         deal with protection today as it is  advanced  as  an  obstacle  to
         return. I said that I would basically have to take a  view  on  the
         claim (in the absence of any [pic]detailed WS) during  cross  which
         was not great. IJ was amenable  throughout  to  all,  rep  accepted
         shared issues between art 8 and protection."

50. As I have said above, Mr O'Ryan confirmed that the appellant  does  not
    object to the Upper Tribunal's  admission  of  Mr  Stainthorpe's  post-
    hearing minute. It is clear from paras  3-8  of  the  Judge's  decision
    that, when the hearing proceeded, the appellant gave evidence about her
    trafficking claim, that Ms Cleghorn made submissions in relation to her
    evidence (para 9 of the Judge's decision) and that Mr Stainthorpe  also
    did (para 17 of the Judge's decision).

51. Para 6(ii) of Mr O'Ryan's submissions dated 6 July 2020 states that  Mr
    Stainthorpe's  post-hearing  minute,  quoted  at  my  para  49   above,
    "potentially" represents the granting of consent.  Given  what  I  have
    said at paras 49-50 above, I am satisfied that Mr Stainthorpe  did,  in
    effect, consent on the respondent's behalf to the Judge considering the
    appellant's evidence that it was "the Mafia" that was  responsible  for
    submitting the employment letter and therefore the appellant's evidence
    that she had been trafficked. There is therefore no issue as to lack of
    jurisdiction.

52. I therefore reject ground 1.

53. Before turning to ground 2, I should mention that the appellant has not
    produced any evidence from either Prolegis Solicitors or Ms Cleghorn to
    support any of the submissions in the grounds of appeal or  to  counter
    the  respondent's  evidence  of  the   post-hearing   minutes   of   Mr
    Stainthorpe.

54. My assessment above in relation to ground 1 also decides the  following
    submissions in ground 2:

         (i)  that it is unclear on what basis the Judge was able to say  at
         para 45 that "the appellant does not meet the rules,  as  discussed
         above, ...".

         (ii) that the Judge  failed  to  make  a  finding  on  whether  the
         appellant had used a false document and therefore did  not  satisfy
         the suitability requirements of the Immigration Rules; and

         (iii)    that,  in  the  alternative,  the  Judge  simply  adopted,
         without the more, the respondent's position.

55. Contrary to ground 2, it is clear that the basis upon which  the  Judge
    concluded that the appellant did not meet the Immigration Rules is that
    he  found,  implicitly,  that  she  did  not   meet   the   suitability
    requirement. This was because he rejected her  evidence  that  she  had
    been trafficked and therefore implicitly rejected her explanation  that
    it was "the Mafia" that had submitted the employment letter. It is  not
    the case that  the  Judge  accepted,  without  more,  the  respondent's
    position. He considered the credibility of the appellant's explanation.



56. The remainder of ground 2 concerns the exercise of discretion under the
    Immigration Rules. As ground 2 correctly states, the Immigration  Rules
    provide for three categories of wrongdoing  which  were  of  decreasing
    seriousness, with different consequences ranging from mandatory refusal
    to  refusal  being  the  normal  course  to  the  possibility  that  an
    application "may" be refused.

57. However, I do not accept that the Judge erred by  failing  to  consider
    the exercise of discretion. In my judgment,  the  submission  that  the
    Judge  was  obliged  to  consider  the  exercise   of   discretion   is
    misconceived, for the following reasons:

         (i)  This part of ground 2 reads as if the appellant had a right of
         appeal against the  respondent's  decision  under  the  Immigration
         Rules on the ground that the decision was not  in  accordance  with
         the Immigration Rules, which is not the case.

         (ii) Prior to the abolition  of  the  right  of  appeal  against  a
         decision made under the Immigration Rules on the  ground  that  the
         decision was not in accordance with the Immigration Rules,  it  was
         an established principle that a judge who decides an appeal brought
         on the ground that the decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  the
         Immigration Rules was obliged to consider for himself the  exercise
         of any discretion conferred on the Secretary  of  State  under  the
         Immigration Rules.

         (iii)    However, there is no longer a right of  appeal  against  a
         decision made under the Immigration Rules on the  ground  that  the
         decision is not in accordance with the  Immigration  Rules.  It  is
         therefore  not  open  to  a  Judge  to  consider  the  exercise  of
         discretion for himself, in my judgment.

         (iv) The appellant's right of appeal was against  the  decision  to
         refuse  her  Article  8  claim  outside  the   Immigration   Rules.
         Accordingly, all that was required  of  the  Judge  was  a  legally
         adequate   assessment   of   the   relevant    circumstances    and
         proportionality. The Judge gave his reasons for concluding that the
         decision was proportionate, at  paras  45-48.  He  found  that  the
         appellant did not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules,
         at para 45. I have said above that this  related  to  his  implicit
         finding  that  the  appellant  did   not   meet   the   suitability
         requirements under the Immigration Rules. He took into account  the
         other relevant factors. In relation  to  para  13  of  Mr  O'Ryan's
         submissions dated 6 July 2020, the Judge  was  plainly  aware  that
         since the appellant's entry clearance application, she had  entered
         into a  relationship  which  he  accepted  was  genuine.  In  these
         circumstances and taking into  account  my  reasons  for  rejecting
         grounds 3 and 4 (see below), which concern  proportionality,  I  am
         satisfied  that  the  Judge's   assessment   of   the   appellant's
         circumstances and proportionality was legally adequate.

58. Accordingly, ground 2 is not established.

59. Ground 3 relates to the Chikwamba principle.  Para  6  of  Mr  O'Ryan's
    submissions dated 24 June 2020 states that the appellant had  submitted
    through her then solicitors (Bankfield Heath Solicitors)  "a  full  six
    months' worth of financial evidence, in compliance with Appendix FM-SE"
    with her application for leave to remain. I reject  the  submission  in
    para 7 of Mr O'Ryan's submissions that, given that the  respondent  had
    not taken issue with the reliability of the evidence submitted  on  the
    appellant's behalf, "the appellant was entitled to proceed on the basis
    that that documentation was accepted as reliable  by  the  respondent".
    The fact is that silence does not equate to a concession on the part of
    the respondent.

60. In any event, even if the evidence as to the sponsor's income did  meet
    the minimum threshold income of �18,600 and even if the requirements of
    Appendix FM-SE were satisfied, ground 3 is wholly lacking in substance.
    Mr Bates correctly draws attention, at para 7 of his skeleton argument,
    that the appellant said in evidence before the Judge  that  the  reason
    why she was unable to provide even the most detail in relation  to  the
    names of towns or areas through which she travelled after  her  alleged
    escape from "the Mafia" in early 2017 was that she did  not  understand
    English. In any event, the appellant's bundle before the Judge did  not
    include any evidence to establish  that  the  appellant  satisfied  the
    English language requirement. Accordingly, it  simply  cannot  be  said
    that, on the evidence before the Judge, an application by the appellant
    for entry clearance as the sponsor's partner would be  successful.  The
    Chikwamba principle was therefore simply not relevant.

61. I therefore reject ground 3.

62. In relation to ground 4, I have to consider the following:

         (i)  The submission in ground 4  that  the  Judge  gave  inadequate
         reasons for his finding that there were no insurmountable obstacles
         to family life between the appellant and the sponsor being  enjoyed
         in Vietnam.

         (ii) The issue raised by the permission judge who said that it  was
         also arguable, in light of the judgment  in  Lal,  that  the  Judge
         failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for  the  finding   that   the
         appellant's British citizen partner  could  relocate  with  her  to
         Vietnam.

63. Mr O'Ryan made submissions in relation to Lal at  paras  10-11  of  his
    submissions dated 24 June 2020.

64. I have carefully considered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in  Lal
    and have concluded that it does  not  assist  the  appellant,  for  the
    following reasons:

         (i)  At para 37 of Lal, the Court of Appeal said:

             "We  do  not  accept,  however,  that  an  obstacle   to   the
             applicant's  partner  moving  to  India   is   shown   to   be
             insurmountable  -  in  either  of  the  ways  contemplated  by
             paragraph EX.2. - just by  establishing  that  the  individual
             concerned would perceive the difficulty as insurmountable  and
             would in fact be deterred by it from relocating to India.  The
             test  cannot,  in  our  view,  reasonably  be  understood   as
             subjective  in  that  sense.  To  treat  it  as   such   would
             substantially dilute the intended stringency of the  test  and
             give an unfair and perverse advantage to  an  applicant  whose
             partner is less resolute or committed  to  their  relationship
             over one whose partner is ready to endure greater hardship  to
             enable them to stay together."

                                                               (My emphasis)

         (ii) The evidence of Mr Wilmshurst, the husband of the appellant in
         Lal, who was in his 70s and retired, that "there was no way that he
         would be able to live in India as he could  not  put  up  with  the
         heat" was supported  by  the  witness  statements  of  two  of  his
         children who said that their father could not stand hot weather and
         had never been able to go on holiday in hot climates.  Furthermore,
         when cross-examined on this point at the hearing before the  First-
         tier Tribunal judge, Mr Wilmshurst explained how he had  refused  a
         good and very well-paid job in Majorca because he would  be  unable
         to live with the heat (para 20 of Lal).

         (iii)    In contrast, there was simply no evidence before the Judge
         in the instant case other than the sponsor's own  evidence  in  his
         witness  statement  that  because  he  has  Wolff  Parkinson  White
         Syndrome and the medication that takes, "I will  struggle  to  cope
         with the heat, and the climate in  Vietnam  would  cause  me  great
         distress".

         (iv) However, it is clear  from  the  judgment  in  Lal  that,  the
         sponsor's subjective perception of the difficulties that  he  would
         face in Vietnam is simply not enough.

65. At para 11 of his submissions dated 24 June 2020, Mr O'Ryan also raised
    the fact that the sponsor gave evidence that  the  medication  that  he
    takes for his heart condition may not be available to him  in  Vietnam.
    This does not assist the appellant either, given that the appellant had
    not submitted any background material to establish that the  medication
    that the sponsor takes for his heart  condition  is  not  available  in
    Vietnam.

66. I turn now to ground 4 as pleaded, i.e. that the Judge gave  inadequate
    reasons for his finding that there were no insurmountable obstacles  to
    family life between the appellant and  the  sponsor  being  enjoyed  in
    Vietnam.

67. Para 26 of the grounds of appeal contends that  "Bearing  in  mind  the
    other arguable errors of law, as set out above, the judge was  arguably
    obliged to provide his reasons  on  this  important  issue  in  greater
    detail". However, I have rejected all the other grounds.

68. Para 26 of the grounds also contends that the Judge's finding  at  para
    48 of his decision that  there  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life continuing outside the United Kingdom, was  given  "in  the
    barest of  terms".  I  do  not  accept  that  the  Judge  gave  legally
    inadequate reasons for not accepting that  the  difficulties  that  the
    sponsor would experience in  relocating  to  Vietnam  would  amount  to
    insurmountable obstacles to family life  being  enjoyed  or  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences. He was plainly aware that the sponsor
    was a British citizen. At para 45, he said that the appellant does  not
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  which  he  said  was  a
    weighty factor in considering proportionality. At para 46, he said that
    the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  had  formed  and   developed   their
    relationship whilst the appellant was in the United Kingdom unlawfully.
    At para 47, he took into account  that,  whilst  the  appellant  has  a
    partner in the United Kingdom, she has  close  and  significant  family
    members in Vietnam including her young son. At para 48,  he  took  into
    account that the sponsor has children and grandchildren in  the  United
    Kingdom; that he also suffers from health problems which  were  managed
    by medication; that he would experience some difficulty  in  relocating
    to Vietnam; and that he has a  significant  pension  income  which  the
    Judge said he could rely upon if he chose to relocate or travel between
    the United Kingdom and Vietnam.

69. I therefore reject ground 4.

70. Having rejected the  grounds  as  pleaded,  I  turn  now  to  make  the
    following points:

71. Para 4 of  Mr  O'Ryan's  submissions  dated  24  June  2020  raises  an
    additional matter. Mr O'Ryan contends that the Judge erred  in  law  by
    proceeding unfairly, in that, it was not clear  whether  the  appellant
    was asked at the hearing about the circumstances in which  she  was  in
    possession of her passport or other documents at the time that she said
    she had escaped from captivity in the United Kingdom.

72. However, this ground was not raised in Mr O'Ryan's grounds  of  appeal.
    No application for permission to amend  the  grounds  to  include  this
    ground  has  been  made.  Accordingly,  the  appellant  does  not  have
    permission to argue  the  ground  raised  at  para  4  of  Mr  O'Ryan's
    submissions dated 24 June 2020.

73. In any event, it simply has not been established  that  there  was  any
    procedural unfairness, i.e. that the appellant was  not  asked  at  the
    hearing about the circumstances in which she was in possession  of  her
    passport or other documents at the time that she said she  had  escaped
    from captivity in the  United  Kingdom.  Mr  O'Ryan  simply  poses  the
    possibility that the appellant may not have been  asked.  There  is  no
    witness statement from Ms Cleghorn to confirm the position one  way  or
    the other.

74. Finally, at para 6(iii) of his submissions dated 6 July 2020, Mr O'Ryan
    submits, in relation to  the  post-hearing  minute  of  Mr  Stainthorpe
    quoted at my para 49 above, that, if the respondent's consent was given
    to the Judge considering the appellant's  protection  claim,  then  the
    Judge erred in law by  failing  to  consider  the  credibility  of  the
    appellant's evidence on the low standard of proof.

75. However, this ground was not in Mr O'Ryan's grounds of appeal.  In  any
    event, I have concluded that the Judge did not consider the appellant's
    protection claim, for the reasons given at para 45 above.

76. For all of the reasons given above,  the  grounds  as  pleaded  and  as
    elaborated in Mr O'Ryan's submissions, do not establish that the  Judge
    erred in law, nor do  any  additional  issues  raised  in  Mr  O'Ryan's
    submissions even if the appellant had  had  permission  to  argue  such
    additional issues, which is not the case.

77. I therefore dismiss the appellant's appeal.

Notice of Decision

78. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    any error on a point of law such that it fell  to  be  set  aside.  The
