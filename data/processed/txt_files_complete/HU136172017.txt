Representation:
For the Appellant:     Herself
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Ejovwoke [O], a  citizen  of  Nigeria  born  28
       December 1982, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of  11
       October 2018  dismissing  her  appeal,  itself  brought  against  the
       Respondent's refusal of her human rights claim of 17 August 2017.

    2. The immigration history supplied by the Respondent sets out that  she
       entered the UK on 22 September 2009 as a Tier 4 General student  with
       leave until 17 January 2011,  extended  under  the  Post  Study  work
       category until  15  February  2013.  On  18  February  2014  she  was
       encountered in Woolwich and arrested as  an  overstayer,  and  served
       with papers alerting her to her removability. She applied for an  EEA
       residence card, which was refused on 31 March 2015; an appeal against
       that decision was dismissed on 15 September 2016.

    3. The present application was based on her parental  relationship  with
       her son [TET], a joint  Polish/Nigerian  national,  the  son  of  her
       former husband [TJT], who she had married in June 2014 and from  whom
       she separated in November 2014; she was  now  her  son  [TET]'s  sole
       carer. The Respondent refused the  application  because  it  was  not
       accepted  that  she  would  face  very   significant   obstacles   to
       integration in Nigeria, and as, though her relationship with her  son
       was accepted, he was not British or seven-years resident,  and  there
       was nothing to suggest that  her  departure  from  the  UK  would  be
       unjustifiably harsh having  regard  to  the  fact  that  it  was  not
       established that the father had any relationship with the son.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal noted the Appellant's evidence that she spoke
       English and Yoruba, whereas her son spoke only  English.  He  was  in
       nursery school. She had no income and was reliant on state  benefits.
       She had no UK-based family; her relatives all lived in  Nigeria.  She
       maintained that her son should have an opportunity to achieve settled
       status in the UK as an EU national.  He  had  been  referred  to  the
       community paediatrician due to behavioural problems,  though  he  had
       not so far received any diagnosis.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal listed the factors it considered relevant  to
       the balancing  exercise,  which  it  listed:  the  need  to  maintain
       immigration  control,  the  economic  well-being  of  the   UK,   the
       desirability  of  consistent  treatment   between   applicants,   the
       Appellant's likely reliance on public funds in the UK, the  fact  her
       private life  was  established  whilst  her  immigration  status  was
       precarious, the likelihood that she could  access  the  help  of  her
       family  in  Nigeria  with  finding  work,  accommodation  or  medical
       treatment, and her presumed ability to maintain  any  friendships  in
       the UK remotely. In her favour, she could  speak  English.  The  sole
       mention of her son's circumstances in the balancing exercise  is  the
       statement that [TET] was young and could be expected to adapt to life
       in Nigeria.

    6. The Tribunal accordingly found that the immigration decision involved
       no disproportionate interference with Article 8 rights, and dismissed
       the appeal, noting that it was open to the Appellant, if  she  wished
       to argue EU rather than human rights points, to make  an  application
       under the EEA Regulations, as the Respondent had  advised  her  in  a
       letter of 22 March 2018.

    7. Grounds of appeal argued that

        a) The best interests and welfare of the Appellant's son had not
           been considered in the balancing exercise - her son continued to
           await a diagnosis for his special needs and his health visitor
           and the school continued to have concerns as to his needs;

        b) Her son was an EU national with an expectation of obtaining
           settled status if he remained in the UK, and he would lose this
           opportunity if he departed sooner - she had taken legal advice,
           from which she learned she could not afford to make an
           application on EU derivative rights grounds,  and that to do so
           would in any event be fruitless, as she would not qualify as she
           lacked the funds to be self-sufficient or to pay for
           comprehensive sickness insurance cover, and in any event
           residence on that ground was uncertain in the light of the
           possibility of "Brexit".

    8. Permission to appeal was granted on 12  November  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, on the basis that the section 55 duty to consider the  best
       interests of a  child  had  not  been  adequately  addressed  in  the
       decision, and nor had the line of authority indicating that it  might
       be unreasonable to make an immigration decision that resulted in  the
       effective expulsion of an EU citizen child from the European Union.

    9. Before me the Appellant was  unrepresented.  She  relied  on  further
       evidence, which Mr Walker agreed should be admitted to be  considered
       should I find an error of law in the decision, by  way  of  a  report
       from her son's school, which stated that he had  serious  behavioural
       problems, though had managed to make some progress with  his  studies
       and to make friends.

   10. Mr Walker realistically accepted  that  the  failure  to  give  overt
       consideration to the best interests of the child  as  potentially  in
       favour   of   the   Appellant's   departure   from   the   UK   being
       disproportionate was a material  error  of  law.  He  invited  me  to
       finally determine the appeal  on  the  basis  of  all  the  available
       evidence,  acknowledging  that  the  best  interests  of  the   child
       necessarily considered the impact of the loss  of  residence  in  the
       European Union.

  Findings and reasons

   11. I accept that there was indeed  a  material  error  of  law  in  this
       appeal. Remarkably, the child's best interests are neither  assessed,
       nor weighed in the balance, in the decision below. A litany of public
       policy reasons that might legitimately be thought to count in  favour
       of the public interest in the Appellant's expulsion  were  identified
       by the Judge below. The sole reason said to count in her  favour  was
       said to be the fact of her speaking English.

   12. However, it is clear that a child who has spent a significant part of
       their life living in the UK might well be disadvantaged by  departing
       the country. That is a question that  demands  reasoned  adjudication
       for its appropriate place in the balance to be assessed.  The  proper
       approach to the assessment  of  a  non-seven  year  resident  child's
       presence is shown by Jackson LJ in EV (Philippines) & Ors [2014] EWCA
       Civ 874 at [35] stated: "A  decision  as  to  what  is  in  the  best
       interests of children will depend on a number of factors such as  (a)
       their age; (b) the length of time that they have been here;  (c)  how
       long they have been in education; (c) what stage their education  has
       reached; (d) to what extent  they  have  become  distanced  from  the
       country to which it is proposed that they return; (e)  how  renewable
       their connection with it may be; (f) to what extent  they  will  have
       linguistic, medical or other difficulties in adapting to life in that
       country; and (g)  the  extent  to  which  the  course  proposed  will
       interfere with their family life ..."

   13. These factors were not  addressed  below.  The  strongest  factor  is
       undoubtedly the child's Polish citizenship. Zambrano [2011] All  E  R
       (EC) 491 establishes that Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning
       of the European Union "is  to  be  interpreted  as  meaning  that  it
       precludes a member state from refusing a third country national  upon
       which his minor  children,  who  are  European  Union  citizens,  are
       dependent, a right of residence in the member state of residence  and
       nationality of those children, and from  refusing  to  grant  a  work
       permit to that third country national, in so far  as  such  decisions
       deprive those children of the genuine enjoyment of the  substance  of
       the rights attaching to the status of European Union citizen".

   14. As shown by the headnote of the  Upper  Tribunal  decision  in  Ahmed
       [2013] UKUT 00089 (IAC), "The principles established by the Court  of
       Justice in Zambrano ... and subsequent cases dealing with Article  20
       of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European  Union  (TFEU)  have
       potential application even where the EEA national/Union citizen child
       of a third-country national is not a  national  of  the  host  Member
       State: the test in all cases is whether the  adverse  decision  would
       require the child to leave the territory of the Union."

   15. Young [TET] is a national of Poland, with no primary carer who  could
       look after him in the UK absent  any  extant  relationship  with  his
       father (that being the Secretary of State's own finding on the  case,
       which the Appellant confirmed  before  me  was  accurate).  Thus  the
       Appellant's expulsion from the UK would inevitably lead to her  son's
       departure alongside her.

   16. Although the Secretary of State  and  the  First-tier  Tribunal  have
       previously taken the view in this case that the EU citizenship  of  a
       child is a separate consideration  from  matters  arising  under  the
       Human  Rights  Convention,  that  does  not  accurately  reflect  the
       authorities, as Mr Walker rightly accepted.

   17. Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 �67 demonstrates  the  potential  relationship
       between the Zambrano principle and the considerations  identified  in
       the Immigration Rules, Lord Reed stating

           "In the event that a  situation  were  to  arise  in  which  the
           refusal of a third-country national's application for  leave  to
           remain in the UK would force his or her British partner to leave
           the EU, in breach of article 20 TFEU, such a situation could  be
           addressed  under   the   Rules   as   one   where   there   were
           "insurmountable  obstacles",  or  in   any   event   under   the
           Instructions   as   one   where    there    were    "exceptional
           circumstances". Typically, however, as in the present cases, the
           British citizen would not be forced to leave the  EU,  any  more
           than in the case of Dereci, and the third-country national would
           not, therefore, derive any rights from article 20."

   18. That reasoning applies a fortiori to the  case  where  it  is  not  a
       partner, but a child, who would be forced to leave the country. It is
       also the case that at the  date  of  decision  in  this  appeal,  the
       Respondent's Guidance - the  Immigration  Directorate  Instruction  -
       Family Migration - Appendix FM, Section  1.0(B)  "Family  Life  as  a
       Partner or Parent and  Private  Life,  10  year  Routes"  stated,  at
       11.2.3: Would it be unreasonable to expect a British Citizen Child to
       leave the UK?

           "Save in cases involving criminality, the  decision  maker  must
           not take a decision in relation to the parent or  primary  carer
           of a British Citizen child where the  effect  of  that  decision
           would be to force that British child to leave the EU, regardless
           of the age of that child. This reflects the  European  Court  of
           Justice Judgment in Zambrano.

           ...

           Where a decision to  refuse  the  application  would  require  a
           parent or primary carer to return to a country outside  the  EU,
           the case must always be assessed on the basis that it  would  be
           unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to leave  the  EU
           with that parent or primary carer.

           In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant  leave  to
           the parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the  UK
           with the child, provided that there is satisfactory evidence  of
           a genuine and subsisting parental relationship.

           It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant  leave  where
           the conduct of  the  parent  or  primary  carer  gives  rise  to
           considerations of such weight as to justify separation,  if  the
           child could otherwise stay with another  parent  or  alternative
           primary carer in the UK or in the EU.

           The circumstances envisaged could cover amongst others:

           .     criminality  falling  below  the  thresholds  set  out  in
           paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules;

           .     a very poor immigration history, such as where the  person
           has repeatedly and deliberately breached the Immigration Rules."

   19. Having had regard to this Guidance, in SF  Albania  [2017]  UKUT  120
       (IAC) the Upper Tribunal states �13:

           "10.  ... it appears to us that the terms of the guidance are an
           important source of the Secretary of State's view of what is  to
           be regarded as  reasonable  in  the  circumstances,  and  it  is
           important in our judgement for the Tribunal at  both  levels  to
           make decisions which are, as far as  possible,  consistent  with
           decisions made in other areas  of  the  process  of  immigration
           control.

           11.   If the Secretary of State makes a decision in  a  person's
           favour on the basis of guidance  of  this  sort,  there  can  of
           course be no appeal, and the result will be  that  the  decision
           falls below the radar of consideration by a Tribunal. It is only
           possible for Tribunals to make  decisions  on  matters  such  as
           reasonableness consistently with those that are  being  made  in
           favour of individuals by the Secretary of State if the  Tribunal
           applies similar or identical processes to those employed by  the
           Secretary of State.

           12.   On occasion, perhaps where it has  more  information  than
           the Secretary of State had or might have had, or  perhaps  if  a
           case  is  exceptional,  the  Tribunal  may  find  a  reason  for
           departing from such guidance. But where there is clear  guidance
           which covers a case where an assessment  has  to  be  made,  and
           where the guidance clearly demonstrates what the outcome of  the
           assessment would have been made by the Secretary  of  State,  it
           would, we think, be the normal practice for the Tribunal to take
           such guidance into account and to apply it in assessing the same
           consideration in a case that came before it."

   20. It can be seen that Zambrano considerations are clearly considered
       relevant by the Home Office Guidance. As explained in SF, the need
       for consistency between judicial and executive decision making
       suggests that that policy should be given effect on appeal. So it is
       clear that, whether flowing directly from EU law or via the
       transposition of aspects of EU law thinking into domestic guidance, a
       child's citizenship can be relevant - and indeed decisive - when
       private and family life arises in the context of a human rights
       grounds of appeal. The First-tier Tribunal was wrong to think
       otherwise.

   21. Thus there are two clear material errors of law in the decision of
       the Judge below. Firstly there is the failure to assess the child's
       best interests, and then to balance that finding against immigration
       control considerations if those interests are in favour of remaining
       in the UK; and secondly, there is the failure to take account of the
       child's nationality as a relevant consideration.

   22. Having found these material errors of law, I accordingly proceed to
       determine the appeal finally, there being no requirement for any
       further hearing. I can be relatively concise as Mr Walker took a
       pragmatic view of the strength of the child's links with the UK given
       his EU citizenship, and did not advance any reasons that would tend
       towards dismissing the appeal.

   23. As a matter purely of domestic  law,  there  are  of  course  various
       public interest factors that count against the Appellant remaining in
       the UK: her dependence on public funds,  the  precariousness  of  her
       residence, and the fact that she has overstayed her leave to  remain.
       However, these considerations must be balanced against her son's best
       interests. In some cases, this might result in a  relatively  complex
       exercise.

   24. However, once one takes account of the consequences  of  constructive
       expulsion of  an  EU  national  child  from  the  European  Union  as
       explained in SF (Albania) and by analogy  with  the  observations  in
       Agyarko, it is clear that carrying through the  immigration  decision
       would represent a disproportionate interference with [TET]'s  private
       life, given there are no public interest factors present reaching the
       relevant threshold in the UKVI Guidance.

   25. I accordingly allow the appeal, because  the  interference  with  the
       Appellant's son's Article 8 rights would  be  disproportionate  given
       that it would frustrate his right to live in the European Union, this
       being a consideration which both Home Office Guidance  and  the  case
       law demonstrates can be relevant to an appeal brought on Human Rights
       Convention grounds.

Decision

The appeal is allowed.
