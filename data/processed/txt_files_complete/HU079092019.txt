                                  DECISION

1.   By my decision granting permission signed on 10 August  2020  and  sent
     to the parties under cover of a notice (IA102) dated 10 September 2020,
     the Upper Tribunal notified the parties of its provisional view:

    (i)  that, for the reasons given in the decision  granting  permission,
         the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Abebrese should be
         set aside in its entirety and that the decision on the  appellant's
         appeal should be re-made; and

    (ii) that, if Judge Abebrese's decision is set aside in  its  entirety,
         this appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  for  the
         decision on the appeal to be re-made by a Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal other than Judge Abebrese and Judge Easterman who  refused
         the application  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  permission  to
         appeal.

2.   In my decision granting permission, the parties were informed that  the
     Upper Tribunal will proceed to issue a decision to give effect  to  its
     provisional view unless the parties objected, with reasons, by 4 pm  on
     the fourteenth calendar day after the date of the Tribunal's notice.

3.   To date, no response has been received from the appellant or  from  the
     respondent.

4.   For the reasons given in  the  decision  granting  permission  and  the
     grounds of appeal, I am satisfied that the decision of  Judge  Abebrese
     involved the making of errors on points of law such that  the  decision
     to dismiss the appeal falls to be set aside. I set aside  the  decision
     of Judge Abebrese to dismiss the appeal.

5.   For the reasons given in the decision granting permission, this  appeal
     is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  Judge  of  that  Tribunal
     other than Judge Abebrese and Judge Easterman to re-make  the  decision
     on the appellant's appeal on all issues on the merits.



Notice of Decision

The decision of Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Abebrese  involved  the
making of errors on points of law such that the decision is set aside.  This
case is remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the  decision  on  the
appellant's appeal to be re-made on all issues on the  merits,  by  a  judge
other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Abebrese and Judge Easterman.
