Solicitors

Subject to there being no abuse of rights, the jurisprudence  of  the  Court
of Justice allows for dependency of choice.  Whilst  the  jurisprudence  has
not to date dealt with dependency of choice in the form of choosing  not  to
live off savings, it has expressly approved  dependency  of  choice  in  the
form of choosing not take up employment (see Centre Publique  d'Aide  Social
de Courcelles v Lebon [1987] ECR 2811 ("Lebon") at [22]) and it may be  very
difficult to discern any principled basis for  differentiating  between  the
two different forms of dependency of choice when the test is a  question  of
fact and the reasons why there is dependency are irrelevant.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The respondent (hereafter "the claimant") is a citizen of  Malaysia  aged
60. She has two grown up daughters, one of them  DK  who  lives  in  the  UK
having married a Finnish national, MD. The claimant is retired and lives  in
Malaysia in a 3-bedroomed property which she owns free of mortgage with  her
mother and a 10 year old grandchild of whom she is guardian.  She  does  not
receive any social benefit. When  she  turned  60  she  became  entitled  to
withdraw all of her savings in an Employers  Provident  Fund  based  on  her
work for 20 years as a laboratory analyst. However,  she  decided  to  leave
her savings untouched. Very early in 2012 her daughter DK began sending  her
remittances. In July 2012 she sought entry clearance as a family  member  of
an EEA national, namely her  Finnish  son-in-law,  with  both  him  and  her
daughter DK as her sponsors. On 22  August  2012  the  appellant  (hereafter
"the ECO") refused her application in the following terms:

         "You have stated in your application form  that  you  are  retired.
         You have stated at Q63 that you receive �450 per  month  from  your
         sponsor in the UK (i.e.  �5,400  per  annum).   However,  you  also
         stated at Q64 that you have a house in Malaysia valued  at  �80,000
         and additional income from an EPF (Employers  Provident  Fund)  old
         age pension to the value of �53,000.  In view  of  this  I  am  not
         satisfied you are genuinely dependent upon your sponsors in the  UK
         and that the funds remitted to you by your sponsors  [her  daughter
         and son-in-law] meet the requirements of Regulation 7(1)(c) of  the
         Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006."

2. In subsequent correspondence following the  claimant's  lodgement  of  an
appeal, the Entry Clearance Manager ("ECM") acknowledged that  the  claimant
had said that the amount remitted was �450 per quarter, not per  month,  but
commented in light of that correction "it could be argued that she has  less
financial dependence than  initially  thought".   The  ECM  noted  that  the
claimant had no evident health problem and acted as a guardian to a 10  year
old child and lived with her own mother: "The remittances  may  well  be  to
contribute to the child's or other relative's maintenance than to  meet  the
appellant's essential needs".  Her home valued at �80,000 was  said  by  the
ECM to be a substantial asset and she could readily  downsize  accommodation
to liquidise assets if needed for her essentials to live on.

3. In her notice of appeal the claimant stated that she could not  sell  her
property to fund her living expenses "as I will have no  where  to  stay  in
Malaysia".  The EPF was to cover unforeseen circumstances.

4. Following a hearing before First-tier Tribunal Judge Thew on 26  February
2013, the claimant's appeal was allowed.   Further  information  before  the
judge was that as from February 2012 the claimant  had  accumulated  �55,487
in savings under her EPF scheme and was entitled from that date to  withdraw
the whole amount but decided to keep the savings  and  make  no  withdrawal.
Her intention was to set up trust funds for her children and  grandchildren.
 She wanted her house to be part of her estate to her children when she  was
not around.   Apart  from  that  she  had  a  small  amount  of  savings  of
approximately �1,650 deposited in a bank account.  Since her retirement  she
had relied on her own  savings  initially  but  her  daughter,  knowing  the
claimant had used up a substantial part of her personal savings,  asked  her
mother to keep the  remaining  savings  for  a  rainy  day  and  since  then
(January 2012) the claimant has been relying on her daughter  for  financial
support.  To cover her living expenses, the claimant  spent  an  average  of
700 to 1000 Malaysia Ringgit per  month  (approximately  �150  to  �200  per
month).  The money sent by the daughter supported the  grandmother  as  well
in terms of the bills.  An aunt was going to take  over  looking  after  the
grandmother when the claimant came to the UK.

5. There is no challenge made by the  ECO  to  the  accuracy  of  the  above
information and the judge found both the daughter  and  son-in-law  credible
witnesses.  At [22] the judge concluded:

         "This evidence, which is credible, is sufficient  for  me  to  find
         that [the claimant] is in fact financially dependent upon  them  in
         that she needs their material support to meet her essential needs."

6. Having cited the case of Moneke (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  00341
(IAC) the judge concluded:

         "25.      The  references  relate  to  economic  activity  and  the
             Tribunal concluded that the dependency  need  not  be  one  of
             necessity.  In his skeleton argument Mr Sowerby said that  the
             question to be answered  was  whether  or  not  the  appellant
             supported herself, not whether the appellant was in a position
             to support herself.  The appellant has said that the funds  in
             the savings fund are not equivalent to a state pension but are
             a lump sum by way of a bond from which she can take  money  if
             she wishes to do so.  She has chosen not to  do  so.   I  find
             that there is no obligation on her to do so and nor  is  there
             an obligation upon her to sell her home in  order  to  provide
             money to live on.  Taking steps to cash in on the bond and  to
             sell her home I find would be economic activity  that  she  is
             not required to undertake.  I find that she is as a matter  of
             fact dependent financially upon her  daughter  and  son-in-law
             and she does not have to undertake economic activity in  order
             to cease to be their dependent.


         26.  On the evidence before  me  I  find  that  the  appellant  has
             discharged the burden which is upon her to establish that  she
             is a dependent family  member  and  she  is  entitled  to  the
             benefit of an EEA permit because of that.  I allow the  appeal
             on the EEA Regulations."

Grounds of appeal and submissions

7. The grounds on which permission to appeal was granted to  the  ECO  noted
that in Moneke the Tribunal had accepted that the definition  of  dependency
was accurately  captured  by  the  current  European  Casework  Instructions
(ECIs) but the latter included the passage: "Financial dependency should  be
interpreted as meaning that the person needs financial support from the  EEA
national or his/her spouse/civil partner in order to meet his/her  essential
needs - not in order to have a certain level of  income".   Given  that  the
claimant was self-sufficient in that she  had  savings  of  �55,000  not  to
mention property valued at �80,000, it was  submitted  that  the  judge  had
given inadequate findings why the claimant was dependent on her  family  for
her essential needs.

8. At the hearing Mr Tufan  reiterated  the  point  that  the  ECIs  drew  a
distinction between meeting essential needs and having a  certain  level  of
income.  He referred to the opinion of the Advocate General  Geehoed  in  C-
1/05 Jia v Migrationsverket C-1/05 [2007] QB 545  ("Jia")  which  stated  at
[96] that whether or not the condition of dependency is fulfilled:


          "... should be  determined  objectively,  taking  account  of  the
         individual circumstances and personal needs of the person requiring
         support.  It would seem to me that the  appropriate  test  in  this
         regard  is  primarily  whether  in  the  light  of  these  personal
         circumstances the dependent's financial means permit him to live at
         the minimum level of subsistence in the country of normal residence
         ... It should be established that this is not a temporary situation
         but that it is structural in character."

     and also at [99] 5th indent:

         "Article 1(d) of Directive  73/148/EEC  is  to  be  interpreted  as
         meaning that the concept of 'dependence' refers to the situation in
         which a  relative  of  a  citizen  of  the  Union  is  economically
         dependent on that citizen of the Union to attain the minimum  level
         of subsistence in the country where he is normally resident ... and
         that this situation is structural in character."

9. Mr  Tufan  submitted  that  on  the  accepted  facts  in  this  case  the
claimant's essential needs came to �1,800 a  year  and  she  had  enough  in
savings to meet these needs for over 20 years.  The claimant, he  submitted,
could not be said to be dependent on the extra money sent by  her  daughter.
If the judge's approach  were  right  there  would  be  nothing  to  stop  a
millionaire applicant showing dependency just  because  they  chose  not  to
draw on money in the bank but instead to live on remittances.

10. Mr Tufan was asked by me to comment on the relevance  to  this  case  of
observations made by Sullivan LJ in SM (India) [2009] EWCA Civ 1426 at [26]-
[27] as follows:

    "26.     For the sake of completeness, I should mention the fact  that,
         although Mr  Palmer  invited  the  court  to  apply  the  test  for
         dependency that is set  out  in  Jia,  he  made  it  clear  in  the
         respondent's skeleton argument that, in the  Secretary  of  State's
         submission the question whether the applicants' essential needs are
         met because of the material support of the Union citizen (or his or
         her spouse or civil partner) needs to be approached with  care  and
         is in any event subject to the  qualification  that  Community  law
         cannot be relied upon for abusive or fraudulent ends. Thus a person
         who is in a position to support himself because,  for  example,  he
         has adequate savings or a sufficient income  but  who  nevertheless
         chooses to live off a  Union  citizen's  contributions  because  he
         prefers to keep his savings intact or to invest his  income,  would
         not, in the Secretary of State's submission, be someone who was  in
         need of material support. A person who artificially placed  himself
         in a position of dependency on a Union citizen for the sole purpose
         of obtaining an immigration advantage, although he might then be in
         need of support, would be excluded from relying on the Directive by
         the application of the general principle in Community law that  its
         provisions cannot be relied on for abusive or fraudulent ends.  The
         example  was  given  in  this  context  of  an  applicant  who  had
         deliberately given up employment or some other source of income  or
         who had divested himself of assets which would have  made  recourse
         to support from the Union citizen unnecessary.


    27.  Since those issues have not previously been raised in the  present
         proceedings, I would prefer to express no view as to whether  these
         two further submissions of the Secretary of State are well-founded.
         The "fraud or abuse" exception is well-established in principle  in
         community law, but its application to dependency  cases  should  be
         considered in the  light  of  specific  and  sufficiently  detailed
         findings of  fact  by  the  AIT.  Considering  the  matter  in  the
         abstract, it is possible to see a distinction between a person who,
         for example, has sufficient savings or income but prefers  to  rely
         on support from a Union citizen and a person  who  could  work  and
         earn an income but who prefers not to do so and to rely on  support
         from a Union citizen. In the former case  the  Secretary  of  State
         would contend that there was simply no need for material support to
         meet essential needs, whereas in the latter case there is a need as
         a matter of fact and it is unnecessary to explore the  reasons  for
         the applicant's recourse to support."


11. Mr Tufan's response was that the claimant fell within  the  category  of
someone who had artificially placed herself in a position of dependency  and
that Sullivan LJ clearly  saw  there  to  be  a  problem  with  such  cases,
although he did not express a view because the issue  had  not  been  raised
previously in the proceedings.  There was a significant  difference  between
a person being forced to work  and  a  person  being  expected  to  draw  on
savings. It was also pertinent, said Mr Tufan, that there was no  suggestion
that the claimant's admission or non-admission to the UK had any  impact  on
the son-in-law's exercise of Treaty rights.

12. Mr Sowerby submitted that I should regard the ECO's grounds as a  simple
disagreement with the judge's findings of fact.  The Court  of  Justice  had
made clear in Centre Publique d'Aide Social de  Courcelles  v  Lebon  [1987]
ECR 2811 ("Lebon")  that  dependency  was  a  purely  factual  question  and
reasons did not come into it.  There was  no  suggestion  in  this  case  of
fraud or an abuse of rights: the claimant's reasons for not drawing  on  her
assets after January  2012  were  entirely  legitimate  features  of  normal
family life - the wish to leave a financial legacy to her  descendants.   It
was not an artificially contrived situation.  If the claimant  came  to  the
UK she would continue to be dependent.  To  deny  her  status  as  a  family
member went against the whole ethos of free movement of families.

13. In a written addendum sent to the Tribunal and Mr  Tufan  shortly  after
the end of the hearing, Mr Sowerby sought to  address  Mr  Tufan's  argument
that  the  judge's  approach   would   create   a   millionaire's   charter.
Emphasising  that  Sullivan  LJ  called  for  a  case-by-case  approach,  he
submitted that  the  claimant's  circumstances  were  very  different  to  a
wealthy person who simply wishes to create an artificial dependency for  the
sole purpose of obtaining an immigration advantage.  The  claimant  had  not
deliberately given up work  or  divested  herself  of  assets  in  order  to
manufacture a dependency.

Discussion
14. In Lebon the claimant and her retired father upon whom she depended  for
support were French nationals living  in  Belgium,  he  having  remained  in
Belgium after he retired.  Having  worked  in  France  for  two  years,  she
returned to Belgium, but had no work. She claimed  subsistence  in  Belgium.
Addressing the meaning of the term "dependent relative"  in  Article  10  of
Regulation 1612/68, the Court held:
      "22. Article 10(1) and (2)...must be interpreted as meaning the status
      of a dependent member of a worker's family is a result  of  a  factual
      situation. The person having that status is a member of the family who
      is supported by the worker and there  is  no  need  to  determine  the
      reasons for recourse to the worker's support or to raise the  question
      whether the person concerned is able to support himself by  taking  up
      paid employment.
      23. That interpretation is dictated  by  the  principle  according  to
      which the provisions establishing the free movement of workers,  which
      constitute one of the foundations of the Community, must be  construed
      broadly ... moreover it corresponds to the wording of the provision in
      question ...
      24 ... the status of dependent member of a worker's family,  to  which
      Article 10(1) and (2) of [the] Regulation refers, is the result  of  a
      factual situation, namely the provision  of  support  by  the  worker,
      without there being any need to determine the reasons for recourse  to
      the worker's support."

15. In Jia, which concerned the interpretation of the term  "dependence"  in
Article 1(1)(d) of Directive 73/148 the Chinese parents-in-law of  a  German
national who worked on a self-employed basis in Sweden sought  to  establish
their dependence on the German national for the purposes this Directive.  In
China the couple were self-sufficient; a dependency  only  arose  in  Sweden
because the parents' income in China was insufficient for them to  live  off
in Sweden.  The question relevant to us which the Court addressed  was:  "Is
article 1.1(d) of Directive 73/148/EEC to be  interpreted  as  meaning  that
'dependence'  means  that  a  relative  of  a  citizen  of  the   Union   is
economically dependent on the citizen of the  Union  to  attain  the  lowest
acceptable standard of living in his country  of  origin...or  where  he  is
normally resident?"

16. By way of answer the Court of Justice stated:
       "35.According  to  the  case-law  of  the  Court,  the   status   of
       'dependent' family member is  the  result  of  a  factual  situation
       characterised by the fact that  material  support  for  that  family
       member is provided by the Community national who has  exercised  his
       right of free movement or by his spouse (see, in relation to Article
       10 of Regulation No 1612/68  and  Article  1  of  Council  Directive
       90/364/EEC of 28 June 1990 on the right of residence (OJ 1990 L 180,
       p. 26), Lebon, paragraph 22, and Case C-200/02 Zhu and  Chen  [2004]
       ECR I-9925, paragraph 43, respectively).
       36. The Court has also held that  the  status  of  dependent  family
       member does not presuppose the existence of a right to  maintenance,
       otherwise that status would depend on  national  legislation,  which
       varies from one State to another (Lebon, paragraph 21). According to
       the Court, there is no need to determine the reasons for recourse to
       that support or to raise the question whether the  person  concerned
       is able to support  himself  by  taking  up  paid  employment.  That
       interpretation is dictated in particular by the principle  according
       to which the provisions establishing the free movement  of  workers,
       which constitute one of the foundations of the  Community,  must  be
       construed broadly (Lebon, paragraphs 22 and 23).
       37. In order to determine whether the  relatives  in  the  ascending
       line of the spouse of a Community  national  are  dependent  on  the
       latter, the host Member State must assess whether, having regard  to
       their financial and social conditions, they are not in a position to
       support themselves. The need for material support must exist in  the
       State of origin of those relatives or the State whence they came  at
       the time when they apply to join the Community national."
  17. In the course  of  surveying  the  jurisprudence  and  other  relevant
  materials the Court of Appeal in Pedro v Secretary of State for  Work  and
  Pensions [2009] EWCA Civ 1358 at [42]-[45] noted the following:
        "The Guidance from the Commission to the European Parliament
    1.  On  2  July  2009  the  Commission  issued  "Guidance  for   better
       transposition and application of Direction 2004/38/EC on  the  right
       of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside
       freely within the territory of the Member States". It is said to:
       "...provide  guidance  to  Member  States  on  how  to   apply   the
       Directive...on the right of citizens of the Union and  their  family
       members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member
       States correctly; with the objective of bringing a real  improvement
       for all EU citizens and of making EU an area  of  security,  freedom
       and justice."
    1. Paragraph 2.1.4. with  reference  to  Lebon  and  Jia,   deals  with
       dependent family members. It states:
       "In order to determine whether family members are dependent, it must
       be assessed in the individual case whether having  regard  to  their
       financial and social conditions, they need material support to  meet
       their essential needs in their country of origin or the country from
       which they came at the time when they applied to join the EU citizen
       (i.e. not in the host Member State where the  EU  citizen  resides).
       Judgments on the concept of dependency of the court did not refer to
       any level of  standard  of  living  for  determining  the  need  for
       financial support by the EU citizen."


18. Having heard the submission of the parties so far, several  things  seem
clear from the agreed findings of fact:

    (i)  the claimant's situation is not  characterised  by  any  abuse  of
         rights.   It  was  her  daughter  who  initiated  the  sending   of
         remittances and it is not suggested that she or her daughter or EEA
         principal son-in-law did so for the  sole  purpose  of  creating  a
         situation of dependence;


    (ii) despite the reference in the ECO refusal to the claimant having an
         "income" from her Employers Provident Fund,  what  she  had  was  a
         capital sum and except for a short period after she retired she had
         not drawn on it to support herself; her daughter had stepped in.

     iii) the claimant's is not a situation where there has simply been  an
          undertaking by the EEA national and his wife to give the claimant
          financial assistance.  That assistance by way of remittances  had
          existed as a matter of fact from early 2012;


      iv) in order to meet the essential needs of the claimant, her  mother
          and the 10 year old child the claimant gets by, without the  need
          to draw on savings, on �150-�200 a month.


19. However, these findings leave undecided the matter  of  whether  or  not
the claimant's essential needs can be said to be met by these remittances.


20. There are a number of considerations that might appear  to  support  the
ECO's position that the remittances sent to the  claimant  demonstrate  that
she was not dependent.

   a.   First, the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice clearly  emphasises
      that assessment of dependency must  take  into  account  the  personal
      situation of the applicant, which might  be  thought  to  entail  that
      dependency cannot simply be deduced from the mere fact of  receipt  of
      financial support by an EEA national or spouse.  This  aspect  of  the
      jurisprudence might be said to be reinforced by the formulation  given
      by the Court of Justice in  Jia  when  it  says  (in  the  context  of
      predecessor EU legislation, Directive  73/148)  that  dependency  "...
      must be interpreted as meaning that proof of  the  need  for  material
      support" is required: see [37], [43] and [44(2)] (emphasis added).


   b.   There is the fact that the Court  of  Justice  has  never  expressly
      rejected the view of Advocate General Geehoed in  Jia  that  financial
      dependency does not exist if the applicant's financial  means  "permit
      him to live at the minimum level of subsistence in the country of  his
      normal residence" and it might be thought this view  implies  that  if
      someone can live at the minimum level of subsistence without financial
      support they are not dependent (see above [14]).


   c. There is the fact that the Sullivan LJ  in SM (India)  at  [27],  even
      though not ruling on the matter because it had not been raised earlier
      in the proceedings, clearly considered that "in the abstract ...it  is
      possible to see a distinction between a person who, for  example,  has
      sufficient savings or income but prefers to rely  on  support  from  a
      Union citizen and a person who could work and earn an income  but  who
      prefers not to do so and to rely on support from a Union citizen."

   d.     Strictly  speaking,  the  acceptance  by  the  daughter  that  her
      remittances also support the claimant's  own  mother  means  that  the
      actual remittance amount needed by the  claimant  herself  is  clearly
      something less then �150 - �200 a month.


   e.    In terms of the  amount  of  money  necessary  for  the  claimant's
      material support (�150-�200 a month), the claimant would appear to  be
      self-sufficient and (even leaving aside the value  of  her  house)  to
      have enough in savings for her to be able to  draw  on  them  only  in
      small measure in order to ensure her essential means are met for 10-20
      years without selling her house.


   f.   There is no  suggestion  in  this  case  that  the  EEA  principal's
      exercise of free movement rights in the UK is affected by whether  the
      claimant is admitted to the UK or not.  In terms of  her  family  life
      ties there is nothing to suggest these could  not  be  maintained,  as
      before, by visits.

21. Nevertheless, in my judgement these considerations cannot  overcome  the
overriding principle established  by  the  jurisprudence  of  the  Court  of
Justice that dependency is a matter of fact and reasons are irrelevant:  see
 [22] of Lebon and [36] of Jia.  As observed by Goldring  LJ  in  Pedro,  at
[62]:

     "As Lebon made clear, whether someone has the status  of  a  dependant
    family member is a question of fact. Such a status is characterised  by
    the material support for that  family  member  provided  by  the  Union
    national who has exercised his free right of movement. Why  the  family
    member is dependent does not matter."

22. The only qualification that the Court of Justice has ever made  to  this
principle is that there  must  not  be  an  abuse  of  rights.  Accordingly,
subject only to there being no abuse of rights,  the  jurisprudence  clearly
allows for dependency of choice.

23. As regards Mr Tufan's suggestion that by saying that  dependency  should
be assessed by reference  to  "the  minimum  level  of  subsistence  in  the
country of normal residence", Advocate General Geehoed in Jia  was  implying
that dependency would only arise if a  claimant  could  show  he  could  not
support himself at the minimum level of subsistence, I do not see  that  the
Advocate  General  was  doing  anything  more  than  trying  to  identify  a
benchmark of material need. In any event,  the  Court  of  Justice  did  not
endorse his approach notwithstanding that  the  question  it  addressed  did
refer to such a benchmark ("Is article 1.1(d) of Directive 73/148/EEC to  be
interpreted as meaning that 'dependence' means that a relative of a  citizen
of the Union is economically dependent  on  the  citizen  of  the  Union  to
attain  the  lowest  acceptable  standard  of  living  in  his  country   of
origin...or where he is normally resident?"). For the Court in Jia  to  have
adopted the Advocate General's approach would have required it  to  identify
a need for the referring court to  have  examined  whether  the  parents-in-
law's means were  above  or  below  the  minimum  level  of  subsistence  in
Germany.  Further, the  Commission's  Guidance  (see  above  [17])   records
that: "[j]udgments on the concept of dependency of the court did  not  refer
to any level of standard of living for determining the  need  for  financial
support by the EU citizen."

24. Even though it seems clear that not all of the sum sent  in  remittances
(amounting to around �150-�200  a  month)  is  for  the  claimant  (some  is
intended to help support her mother and the 10  year  old  grandchild),  for
dependency to arise it is not necessary that a  person  be  wholly  or  even
mainly dependent. If a person requires material support for essential  needs
in part, that is sufficient.

25. Whilst the jurisprudence has  not  to  date  dealt  with  dependency  of
choice in the form of choosing not to live off  savings,  it  has  expressly
approved dependency of choice in  the  form  of  choosing  not  to  take  up
employment: see above Lebon [22].  I readily acknowledge that in SM  (India)
Sullivan LJ saw it as possible that there was a distinction relating to  the
situation of a claimant who preferred living off savings and a claimant  who
preferred not to work (see above [14]). But it is very difficult to  discern
any principled basis for differentiating between the two different forms  of
dependency of choice when the test is simply a  question  of  fact  and  the
reasons why there is dependency are irrelevant.  Indeed,  if  anything,  one
might have thought that expecting  a  retired  person  to  utilise  existing
financial resources after a  lifetime  of  work  is  more  problematic  than
expecting a young able bodied person to earn a wage.

26. There is the additional  problem  that  any  attempt  to  erect  such  a
distinction would entail examination of personal circumstances that was,  or
might be, intrusive, necessitating questions,  in  this  case  for  example,
about what are the reasonable accommodation needs of the  claimant's  mother
and the 10 year old child  presently  living  in  her  house,  in  order  to
establish whether it was realistic  to  expect  her  to  sell  her  existing
house.

27.  To  the  extent  that  the  jurisprudence  clearly  considers  that  an
examination of  personal  circumstances  is  relevant,  in  respect  of  the
claimant, it would appear that her situation is  one  in  which  she  has  a
sentimental attachment  to  her  home  as  well  as  it  being  a  potential
financial asset. Both the savings  she  has  and  the  house  she  owns  are
regarded as assets she wishes  to  preserve  for  her  descendants.  She  is
intending to set up trusts for her children. They are earmarked, that is  to
say, out of  legitimate  inter-generational  family  considerations.  Hence,
whilst it is correct that in the claimant's case it is  not  suggested  that
refusal of entry clearance would  have  any  deterrent  effect  on  the  EEA
principal or her daughter-in-law in terms of their  continuing  to  live  in
the UK and his continuing to exercise Treaty rights,  it  remains  that  the
claimant's own right  to  respect  to  family  and  private  life  would  be
adversely affected if she were required to sell her house or  live  off  her
savings  (as  the  ECO  suggested  she  could).  The  desire  to  leave   an
inheritance for one's descendants is a matter  that  would  appear  to  fall
within the scope of Article 8 of the ECHR  (Article  7  of  the  Charter  of
Fundamental Rights).

28. Accordingly, I would reject the ECO's submissions and conclude that  the
First-tier Tribunal Judge did not err in law in allowing the appeal.  In  so
doing she correctly applied established jurisprudence.
The issue of order for reference

29. Although I have not been asked to consider making an order of  reference
to the Court of Justice  in  Luxembourg  by  either  party,  I  consider  it
pertinent to explain why I  have  decided  not  to  make  one.  It  will  be
apparent  from  the  above  that  although  I  have  highlighted   competing
considerations regarding interpretation of the term dependency, I have  been
able  to  resolve  them  for  myself.  If  I   had   considered   that   the
interpretation of dependency was not acte clair I would have  given  serious
consideration to whether or not to make an order for reference  pursuant  to
Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

 30. As set out in R v International Stock Exchange of the  United  Kingdom
and the Republic of Ireland, ex parte Else (1982)  Limited  [1993]  QB  534,
545D the test under Article 267  is  whether  a  judge  considers  that  the
Community law issue is "critical to  the  court's  final  decision".  In  ex
parte Else, Sir Thomas Bingham went  on  to  say  that  when  the  issue  is
critical "the appropriate course is ordinarily to refer  the  issue  to  the
Court of Justice unless the national  court  can  with  complete  confidence
resolve the issue itself".

31. I must confess to having some difficulty  with  treating  the  "complete
confidence" formulation as a perfect mirror of the test  of  whether  it  is
critical or necessary to enable the court to  give  judgment.  In  the  same
passage Sir Thomas stated that  "I  am  not  here  attempting  to  summarise
comprehensively the effect of such leading cases as HP Bulmer v J  Bollinger
SA [1974] Ch.401, Srl CILFIT and Lanificio  di  Gavardo  SpA  v.Ministry  of
Health [1982] ECR 3415 and R v The Pharmaceutical Society of  Great  Britain
ex parte The Association of Pharmaceutical Importers  [1987]  3  CMLR  951",
cases which essentially set out the doctrine of  acte  clair.  Later  on  in
another passage, Sir Thomas appears  to  formulate  the  test  in  terms  of
whether the application of Community law is or is  not  "so  obvious  as  to
leave no scope  for  any  reasonable  doubt".  In  the  instant  case  I  am
satisfied that a reference is not critical or necessary in order for  me  to
make my decision and that there is  no  scope  for  reasonable  doubt  about
that. I am  confident  that  the  Court  of  Justice  would  not  adopt  the
interpretation advocated by the ECO. Whether, however, I could  say  I  have
"complete" confidence on this question is perhaps less certain.

32. In the end I do not consider that my decision should turn  on  what  may
well be a semantic concern because, unlike the  situation  for  the  highest
court, for every other court the decision as to whether to make a  reference
is a discretionary one. Of course, if I had found the  issue  was  not  acte
clair, the fact that I am considering the case at the  level  of  the  Upper
Tribunal would not matter. Case  C-210/06  Cartesio  has  established  that.
Nevertheless, in my judgement it is a relevant  factor  that  the  Court  of
Appeal in SM (India) identified the very scenario with which I am  faced  in
this case as a problematic one. The Court only decided not  to  rule  on  it
because it had not previously been raised in the submissions, but left  very
clear that it saw the issue as of importance. In this sense the Court  could
be said to have already taken some ownership of the issue as  a  problematic
one.

33. In my judgement in the above  circumstances  the  appropriate  course  I
should take is to maintain the position I have adopted  above,  leaving  for
the ECO to lodge an application for permission to appeal  to  the  Court  of
Appeal so that, if I was persuaded by it to grant permission, the  Court  of
Appeal would then have the opportunity to return to  the  issue  in  a  case
where it was material to the outcome of the appeal.

34. To conclude:

The First-tier Tribunal judge did not err in law and her decision  to  allow
the claimant's appeal shall stand.
