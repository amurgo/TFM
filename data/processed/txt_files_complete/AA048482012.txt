                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



           Notice of Withdrawal of Case Pursuant to Rule 17 of The Tribunal
                    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008

1. The appellant is a citizen of Iran  born  in  1969.  He  arrived  in  the
   United Kingdom and claimed asylum on 13 September  2011.  His  claim  was
   refused on 29 April 2012 and a decision was made the same day  to  remove
   him from the United Kingdom as an illegal entrant.


2. The appellant's appeal against that decision was heard before the  First-
   tier Tribunal on 4 July 2012 and was  dismissed.  Following  a  grant  of
   permission to appeal against the First-tier Tribunal's decision,  it  was
   decided by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb, following a hearing on 19 November
   2012 in the Upper Tribunal, to set aside the decision of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal for reason of errors of law and to re-make it.

3. In the meantime, the respondent has agreed  to  recognise  the  appellant
   and his family as refugees and grant them leave to remain accordingly. As
   a result, the appellant's representatives have advised the Tribunal, in a
   letter dated 23 May 2013, that  the  appellant  wishes  to  withdraw  his
   appeal, pursuant  to  paragraph  17  of  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
   Tribunal) Rules 2008. It is assumed that what  is  intended  is  that  he
   wishes to withdraw his case before the Upper Tribunal.

4. In accordance with the requirements of paragraph 17(2)  of  The  Tribunal
   Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  consent  is  given  for   the
   withdrawal of the  appellant's  case  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  under
   paragraph 17(1)(a). The effect of that withdrawal is that  the  appellant
   is withdrawing his appeal against the respondent's decision of  29  April
   2012.
