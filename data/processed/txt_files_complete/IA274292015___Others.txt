                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Kelly made
    following a hearing at Bradford on 7th January 2015.

Background

 2. The first appellant entered the UK on 19th February 2010 as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant with leave to remain  until  4th  August  2012.   The
    second and third appellants are his wife and child respectively.  Leave
    was subsequently extended to 16th August 2012.  He applied for  further
    leave to remain on 16th October  2012  which  was  granted  until  27th
    January 2015, when he applied for indefinite leave to remain as a  Tier
    1(General) Migrant. He was refused on 22nd July 2015.

 3. In his 2012 application the appellant claimed that his income came from
    three  sources  and  amounted  to  �41,276.35.   He  had  provided   an
    accountant's letter which stated that he had pre-tax profits of �25,373
    from his self-employed business and pay slips and bank statements which
    showed gross employed earnings of �7,852.93 and �8,050.20 respectively.
     Enquiries made with HMRC in connection with the  application  relating
    to the refusal under appeal showed that he had not declared his  income
    from his self-employed business and had therefore only been taxed  upon
    his earnings of �15,025.28.  As this was not consistent with the income
    previously  declared,  the  present  applications  were  refused  under
    paragraphs 322(1A) and 322(2) of HC 395.

The Appellant's Case

 4. It is the appellant's case that he  was  self-employed  as  a  business
    consultant in addition to  having  two  sources  of  income  from  paid
    employment.  He says that he did have the pre-tax  profits  claimed  in
    his previous application but he accepts that he failed to  declare  his
    income as a business consultant during the relevant tax year.   He  had
    previously employed a chartered accountant, JD Accountants Limited,  to
    prepare his accounts but was  introduced  by  a  friend  to  one  "Asif
    Hussain" who offered to prepare his tax return for a much cheaper  fee.
    He provided all of the relevant documentation to Mr Hussain and assumed
    that he had filed his accounts with HMRC. So far as he was concerned he
    had paid the tax which was due.  It was a shock to  discover  from  the
    respondent's letter, which explained the reasons for refusing him leave
    to remain, that no accounts had been filed or tax paid  in  respect  of
    the self-employed earnings.  It was only at that point that he realised
    that he had been defrauded by Mr Hussain, to whom he had paid a fee and
    monies which he had been informed were owed in tax. However he had  not
    informed the police.  Shortly before the hearing before  Mr  Kelly,  he
    wrote to HMRC seeking to amend the details of his previous declaration.



 5. The judge concluded that the appellant was evasive in relation  to  his
    explanation for failing to declare his income from  self-employment  to
    the HMRC and  he  found  it  implausible  that  he  would  entrust  his
    financial affairs to a friend of a friend of whom he knew  very  little
    and who did not hold the appropriate qualifications.

 6. The judge wrote:

         "In all the above circumstances and in the absence of  any  written
         confirmation of receipt from HMRC I am unwilling to accept that the
         appellant has belatedly disclosed his income  from  self-employment
         for 2012 to 2013 in the undated letter that appears at pages 26 and
         27 of his bundle of documents".

 7. The judge concluded that, on balance, Mr Arif Hussain was a figment  of
    the appellant's imagination.

 8. He wrote as follows:

         "Given my findings in the preceding paragraph I conclude  that  the
         appellant's application ought to have been refused under  paragraph
         322(5) of the Immigration Rules rather than paragraph 322(1A).  The
         underlying basis for refusal is however the same, namely conduct by
         the appellant involving deception  or  culpable  non-disclosure  in
         relation to earnings that he had generated  in  the  UK.   In  such
         circumstances the only appropriate  exercise  of  discretion  under
         paragraph 322(5) was to refuse the application".

 9. On that basis he dismissed the appeal.

10. The appellant sought permission to appeal in grounds which  mainly  re-
    state his case but specifically challenging the judge's conclusion that
    there was no written confirmation from HMRC in the  papers.  He  argued
    that the judge had erred in law in respect of his findings of deception
    in relation to paragraph 322(1A) and reiterated his case under  Article
    8 of the ECHR.

11. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Immigration  Judge  Cruthers  who
    observed that, from where the copy of the letter from HMRC was  on  the
    Tribunal file he suspected that it may have been before  the  judge  at
    the hearing although it was not a part of the main bundle.

Consideration of Whether there is an Error of Law

12. Mrs Pettersen accepted that the judge had erred.  She did  not  dispute
    that there was on the file a letter from HMRC dated 22nd December  2015
    headed:

         "Late payment penalties for the year ended 5th April 2013"

    and she agreed that he was wrong to substitute a different  Immigration
    Rule to  that  which  had  been  the  foundation  of  the  respondent's
    decision.

13. I have sympathy with the judge in  overlooking  the  letter  from  HMRC
    which was separate from the other documents in the bundle but it  would
    appear that it was before him. It was potentially relevant to the issue
    of whether the appellant had acted dishonestly in seeking  to  rely  on
    self-employed income which,  according  to  the  judge,  he  had  never
    received.

14. Accordingly the judge did not take into account  all  of  the  evidence
    when making his decision.

15. Second, the basis of the respondent's refusal was paragraph 322(1A) and
    322(2).  These read as follows.

         "Refusal of leave to remain, variation of leave to enter or  remain
         or curtailment of leave


         322.     In addition to the Grounds of Refusal of extension of stay
             set out in Parts 2-8 of these Rules, the following  provisions
             apply in relation to the refusal of an application  for  leave
             to remain, variation of leave to enter  or  remain  or,  where
             appropriate, the curtailment of leave:

             Grounds on which leave to remain and  variation  of  leave  to
             enter or remain in the UK are to be refused


             (1A) Where false  representations  have  been  made  or  false
                  documents or information have been submitted  (whether  or
                  not material to the application, and whether or not to the
                  applicant's knowledge), or material facts  have  not  been
                  disclosed, in relation to the application or in  order  to
                  obtain documents from the Secretary of State  or  a  third
                  party required in support of the application.

             Grounds on which leave to remain and  variation  of  leave  to
             enter or remain in the UK should normally be refused


             (2)  The making of false representations  or  the  failure  to
                  disclose any material fact for the  purpose  of  obtaining
                  leave to enter or a previous  variation  of  leave  or  in
                  order to obtain documents from the Secretary of State or a
                  third party required in support  of  the  application  for
                  leave to enter or a previous variation of leave".

16. Paragraph 322(1A) is a mandatory ground of  refusal  whereas  paragraph
    322(2) is discretionary.

17. Paragraph 322(5), also discretionary, provides the following:

         "An application should normally be refused:

         The undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain  in
         the UK in the light of his conduct (including convictions which  do
         not fall within paragraph 322(1C)), character  or  associations  or
         the fact that he represents a threat to national security".

18. By substituting paragraph 322(5) the judge did not give the opportunity
    to the appellant's representative to make submissions as to whether the
    non-disclosure of earnings to HMRC made it undesirable for  him  to  be
    permitted to remain in the UK.





Re-making the Decision

19. I heard further oral evidence from the appellant who explained that  he
    was in the process of making payments to HMRC in  respect  of  the  tax
    owed.  It would appear from  a  self-assessment  statement  dated  30th
    December 2015 that the appellant has made a number of payments  between
    July 2014 to 28th January 2016.  According to a letter of 16th May 2016
    he still owes �7,711.06.

20. The appellant has instructed another set of chartered  accountants  who
    have sent in to HMRC an amended tax return for the years 2012, 2013 and
    2014.

21. Mr [G] said that he had run different businesses  during  the  relevant
    time period.  He initially set up a  company  which  prepared  business
    plans, market analysis, software and forecasting services.  It  stopped
    trading in December 2012 because he had difficulty  in  training  up  a
    reliable team for expansion.  There was then a period when  he  had  no
    self employment which lasted until August 2014 when  he  started  up  a
    company called Mass International which stocked hosiery and linen. That
    company ceased in April 2015 because he was low on stock and he did not
    want to invest in  replenishing  it  before  he  knew  whether  he  had
    obtained his indefinite leave to remain.

22. Mr [G] explained that he had a Masters degree in chemistry and he hoped
    that he would be able to be a secondary school teacher by  this  point,
    since he had already taught GCSE and A levels, but he  needed  to  sort
    out his application for indefinite leave and to gain more knowledge  of
    the national curriculum before he was able to qualify as a teacher  via
    taking salaried employment which was one of the routes open to him.

Submissions

23. Mrs Pettersen submitted that  the  appellant's  explanation  for  using
    different accountants made no sense, and  although  there  appeared  to
    have been a late attempt to regularise his position, he had not given a
    proper explanation as to why he had not  continued  with  his  previous
    trading which had at least provided some income.  She said that it  was
    unlikely, although it was very difficult to say given the  muddle  over
    his financial affairs, that his self-employment  would  have  generated
    the necessary income to  acquire  the  points  awarded  in  2012.   She
    rejected his present case which was that he had made an honest  mistake
    in the past and submitted that the appeal ought to be dismissed.

Findings and Conclusions

24. Mr [G]'s financial affairs have clearly been in some confusion.  It  is
    not possible on the basis of the incomplete information before me today
    to say what his income from self-employed earnings was in  2012.   Like
    Judge Kelly, I am not satisfied that the appellant did not realise that
    he ought to have been paying tax on his self-employed income  and  that
    he had been defrauded by someone posing as an accountant.  It makes  no
    sense, when he had a chartered accountant, to  go  to  a  friend  of  a
    friend. It is clear that he only took steps to  rectify  the  situation
    once the impact of his failure to pay the correct tax became  clear  in
    the reasons for refusal letter.

25. I am however satisfied that the appellant was engaged in  self-employed
    activity during that period.  He has provided a  number  of  documents,
    including from JD Accountants Limited, showing his income for the  year
    January 2014 to January 2015 from  Mass  International.   His  evidence
    that he had a previous business is supported  by  a  letter  from  HMRC
    which refers to late payment penalties for the  year  ended  5th  April
    2013.

26. I therefore find that the author of the reasons for refusal letter  was
    wrong when he concluded that the appellant had not  been  self-employed
    as claimed and that his earnings were a fabrication.  The likelihood is
    that the appellant was in some form of self-employment even though  his
    earnings were not declared to HMRC.

27. The refusal under paragraph 322(1A) cannot stand since  the  respondent
    has not established that the appellant has made  false  representations
    or employed deception in relation to a previous application.

28. The consequence of this decision is not that the  appellant  should  be
    granted indefinite leave to remain without further enquiry.   No  doubt
    the Secretary of State will consider whether paragraph 322(5) would  be
    appropriate, and that is a matter which the appellant should expect  to
    have to address.

Notice of Decision

29. The original judge erred in law.  His decision is set aside.  It is re-
    made as follows.  The appellant's appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
