Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a Secretary of State's appeal against  the  decision  of  Judge
    Herbert made following a hearing at Taylor House on 9th March 2018.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 20th  June  1991.   He
    was granted leave to enter to come to the UK as a student from 2010  to
    2012 and further leave to remain successively until 27th February 2016.



 3. On 10th June 2015 his leave was curtailed and he was given 60  days  to
    find a new sponsor as his previous college licence had been revoked  by
    the Home Office.   Following  a  judicial  review  application  he  was
    allowed a further 60 days under a consent order sealed  on  17th  March
    2016.  On  9th  August  2016  the  Secretary  of  State   undertook   a
    reconsideration of his application and the refusal was maintained.

 4. At the hearing before the judge it was accepted that the claimant could
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 5.  The  claimant  was  unable  to  obtain  a  CAS  letter  from   various
    universities within the relevant time because, he said,  there  was  no
    university to which he applied which  was  willing  to  provide  a  CAS
    letter without him having at least a three month visa in place.

 6. The judge set out the law contained in Section 117B of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which sets out the factors  which  have
    to be taken into account in consideration of Article 8.

 7. He said that he viewed the claimant's circumstances in  the  UK  to  be
    triggered in part by his education.  If he is wrongly denied his access
    to education it means that his intending marriage to his  fianc�e,  who
    is  an  Afghanistan  national  residing  in  the  UK  with  a   pending
    application for indefinite leave  to  remain,  would  be  significantly
    jeopardised.  The claimant would be forced to return to Afghanistan and
    spend significant amounts of money and time in seeking to re-enter  the
    UK.  He had studied and lived in the UK  for  several  years  perfectly
    lawfully, has complied with immigration control at no cost  to  the  UK
    taxpayer and if anything had been a benefit to the UK  economy  through
    the institutions at which he had studied.

 8. The judge accepted that the claimant did not have a right to education,
    but said it could be argued that the substantial interference with  his
    right to remain is predicated upon his ability to study.  If  that  was
    removed his ability to stay in the UK was also removed.  There would be
    significant harm done to the claimant's private and family life  should
    his ability to study be jeopardised.

 9. The judge set out the five stage step approach set out by Lord  Bingham
    in the case of Razgar and concluded that if the claimant was forced  to
    return to Afghanistan the likelihood is that he would obtain  leave  to
    enter.  There could therefore be very little in the way of  undermining
    of the UK's immigration policy to permit the claimant and  others  like
    him to remain in the UK..

10. He concluded as follows

         "I have taken into account  all  the  prevailing  factors  and  the
         relevant legislation and whilst the appellant's  education  is  not
         the trigger point of the exercise  of  his  Article  8  rights  the
         consequences on him are that it would mean his relocating  back  to
         Afghanistan with the dislocation of his  private  and  family  life
         with his fianc�e and will cost significant amounts of  money  those
         are not things which are his right to education but  an  entrancing
         part of his right to life to continue insofar as he can in  the  UK
         enabled by the grant of  leave  to  remain  to  continue  with  his
         studies.  I therefore believe  that  the  balancing  act  falls  in
         favour of the appellant not simply under the basis of his education
         but of the wider effects of his private  and  family  life  as  are
         before me.  Put in summary there is very little  detriment  to  the
         necessity  of  maintaining  immigration  control   but   there   is
         substantially greater harm to this individual appellant private and
         family life in the circumstance.  I  find  that  the  remedy  would
         simply be that this could  be  cured  if  the  respondent  were  to
         consider the appellant leave to remain for a four month  period  so
         that he could obtain his relevant CAS letter which I can understand
         he can do in August 2018 without difficulty."

The Grounds of Application

11. The Secretary of State sought permission to  appeal  on  the  following
    grounds

      i) First, the judge failed to make any finding as to what Article 8(1)
         compliant life the claimant has in the UK.

     ii) Second, he repeatedly placed weight upon the claimant's failure  to
         obtain a course of study, albeit stressing that there was no  right
         to education.  The public interest is  clearly  strong  in  a  case
         where the claimant does not meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules.
         University policy  on  leave  to  remain  requirements  for  future
         students is not a matter for the Secretary  of  State  nor  can  it
         weaken the public interest.

    iii) Third, there is no suggestion that  the  claimant  argued  that  he
         could meet the in country Appendix FM Rules on  the  basis  of  his
         relationship with his fianc�e.  In fact they require  him  to  have
         had entry clearance on that basis.   The  judge  erred  in  placing
         weight upon a relationship which does not lead  to  an  in  country
         route to settlement.

     iv) Finally, the judge erred in giving material weight to the prospects
         of the claimant's re-entry via entry  clearance  on  the  basis  of
         studies which the claimant has not yet identified  or  applied  for
         and which would require entry clearance, and a  relationship  which
         requires entry clearance (fianc�e) where  there  is  no  suggestion
         that the claimant has shown that he  would  be  able  to  meet  the
         requirements of those Rules.

12. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge  Robertson  for  the  reasons
    stated in the grounds on 1st August 2018.

The Hearing

13. Mr Dingley provided a skeleton argument.

14. Ground 1.  It was submitted that the judge considered Section  117B  at
    paragraph 13 of the determination.

15. Ground 2.  It was accepted that the university's policies are neither a
    matter for the claimant nor a matter for consideration of  what  is  in
    the public interest but the judge was entitled to draw upon a range  of
    particular factors which relate to the claimant's specific situation as
    to whether it would be proportionate under Article 8(2) to  expect  him
    to return to Afghanistan.

16. Ground 3. Nowhere in the determination does the judge imply or  suggest
    that the claimant met  the  Immigration  Rules  on  the  basis  of  his
    relationship with his fianc�e.  He plainly did not place  any  reliance
    on this aspect as a part of the claimant's successful appeal.  Reliance
    was placed upon Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60.   Fundamentally  the  First-
    tier Tribunal conducted a balance sheet approach and weighed  the  pros
    and cons as he was required to do.

17. Ground 4.  The Immigration Judge gave no  material  weight  as  to  the
    prospects of a possible foreseeable entry clearance application, simply
    weighing the appropriate circumstances at the time of  the  hearing  in
    accordance with Razgar.  Ultimately the  judge  correctly  applied  the
    considerations of Section 117B and found that the  public  interest  in
    maintaining immigration control would not be sufficiently undermined by
    granting   the   claimant   leave,   having   properly   balanced   the
    countervailing features of his case on each side in accordance with the
    law.

Findings and Conclusions

18. I conclude that the judge did err in law, for the reasons  set  out  in
    the grounds.

19. It is not sufficient for the judge to set out the provisions of Section
    117B.  It was incumbent on him to demonstrate  that  he  applied  those
    provisions in his consideration of the case.  It states in  terms  that
    little weight should be given to a private life established by a person
    at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.

20. Mr Dingley was unable to show me anywhere in this  determination  where
    the judge applied that  Section.  Mr  Sadiq's  private  life  has  been
    established at a time when  his  immigration  status  has  always  been
    precarious.  Little weight  should  therefore  be  given  to  it.   The
    failure to acknowledge that is a material error of law.

21. Accordingly the decision has to be remade.

22. I invited both parties to make further submissions.  Mr Dingley said he
    had no further submissions to make save to state  that  the  claimant's
    wife is now expecting a baby.

23. It is acknowledged by the claimant that he cannot meet the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules because he does not have  a  CAS  letter.   He
    therefore has no basis of stay in the UK.  There is  clearly  a  strong
    public interest in his removal. His private life must be  given  little
    weight.

24. No evidence was given in relation to any of the other  Section  117B(6)
    factors either in relation to the claimant's financial situation or his
    ability to speak English. No further evidence was given save that it is
    claimed that he is now married and expecting a child. It is not at  all
    clear whether his wife has any status here, but if  she  does,  he  can
    make a further application.  He also has the ability to return  to  his
    country of origin and make an application for entry clearance to study.



Notice of Decision

25. The original judge erred in law.  His decision is  set  aside.   It  is
    remade as follows.

26. The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed and the claimant's  original
    appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
