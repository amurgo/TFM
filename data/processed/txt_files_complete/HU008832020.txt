                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For  ease  of  reading,  I  shall  refer  to  the  appellant  in  these
    proceedings as the Secretary of State and to the respondent as Mrs R-D.

 2. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Loke ("the judge"), promulgated on 14 December 2020. By that  decision,
    the judge allowed Mrs R-D's appeal against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision, dated 24 December 2019,  refusing  her  human  rights  claim,
    which had been made in the context of deportation proceedings.

 3. Mrs R-D is a citizen of Jamaica  born  in  1965.  She  came  to  United
    Kingdom as long ago as October 1998. Having then  overstayed,  she  was
    subsequently granted two periods of discretionary leave. Prior  to  the
    expiry of that second period, Mrs R-D was convicted of  benefit  fraud,
    sentenced to 30  months'  imprisonment,  and  made  the  subject  of  a
    confiscation order in the sum of  approximately  ï¿½20,000.  On  25  July
    2014, a deportation order was made  against  her  pursuant  to  section
    32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007. An appeal against that  decision  was
    dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Afako  on  17  March  2015
    (DA/01612/2014) and this was upheld by the Upper Tribunal by a decision
    promulgated on 21 December of that same year.

 4. Mrs R-D submitted further representations in 2017 and 2018, which  were
    treated as an  application  to  revoke  the  deportation  order.  Those
    representations were rejected under paragraph 353  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Judicial review proceedings were threatened and the Secretary of
    State reconsidered her paragraph 353 decision and then refused  Mrs  R-
    D's human rights claim, giving rise to a right of appeal.

 5. The essence of Mrs R-D's  case  on  appeal  was  as  follows.  She  was
    effectively a primary carer for her 16-year-old daughter,  K,  and  her
    mother, who suffers from dementia. Her husband, Mr D, was an  alcoholic
    who was incapable of fulfilling all familial  responsibilities  in  her
    absence. An adult daughter, D-J, had a  young  child  of  her  own  and
    suffered from  mental  health  problems.  The  family  unit  was  being
    financially supported by an adult son, D, who was struggling to  fulfil
    this role. It was said that Mrs R-D could either the exception set  out
    in section 117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,
    as amended ("the 2002 Act"), or  the  "very  compelling  circumstances"
    test set by section 117C(6) of the 2002 Act.



The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 6. Rather than set out the detail of the judge's decision at this stage, I
    propose instead to simply summarise her conclusions and the outcome.  I
    will deal with the  substance  of  her  decision  when  addressing  the
    various strands of the Secretary of State's challenge, below.

 7. The judge concluded at [30] and [33] that it would not be unduly  harsh
    for Mrs R-D to be deported to Jamaica whilst Mr D and K remained in the
    United Kingdom (the Secretary of State had  accepted  in  her  decision
    letter that it would be unduly harsh for K to go and  live  in  Jamaica
    and this was confirmed by the judge at [31]).

 8. Having taken a number of factors into consideration at  [40]-[46],  the
    judge went on to conclude that there were very compelling circumstances
    in the case, with the effect that the Secretary of State's decision was
    disproportionate and therefore unlawful. She accordingly allowed Mrs R-
    D's appeal.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 9. The grounds of appeal are set out under the heading "Making a  material
    misdirection in law/failing to provide adequate reasons on  a  material
    matter and/or omitting a material consideration." The  main  thrust  of
    the grounds is the assertion that the judge failed to provide  adequate
    reasons in respect  of  the  factors  relied  on  in  arriving  at  her
    conclusion on the very compelling circumstances issue. In addition,  it
    is said that the judge failed to take account of an  individual  called
    Kiesha (a niece of Mrs R-D) who are provided  some  assistance  to  the
    family, and failed to take account of  Mrs  R-D's  evidence  concerning
    remorse.

10. Permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  14
    January 2021.



Discussion and conclusions on error of law

11. At the end of the hearing and having taken a short break to reflect  on
    the relevant issues, I informed the parties of my conclusion  that  the
    judge had not materially erred in law  and  that  her  decision  should
    stand. My analysis of the issues and reasons for my conclusion  are  as
    follows.

12. As is really rather common in respect of grounds of appeal  drafted  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State, there is a  somewhat  bald  assertion
    that the judge in question has "misdirected" himself or herself in law.
    All too often, the alleged misdirection (as opposed,  for  example,  to
    reasons challenges or assertions that matters have not been taken  into
    account) are not particularised, as is the case here. As I indicated to
    Mr Tufan at the hearing, I found  it  difficult  to  detect  any  legal
    misdirection on the judge's  part.  She  plainly  had  the  appropriate
    statutory  framework  in  mind  throughout  her  consideration,  namely
    section 117C of the 2002 Act. She correctly began  with  the  exception
    under section  117C(5)  and  then  moved  on  to  the  very  compelling
    circumstances test under section 117C(6). As regards the importance  of
    the public interest in deportation cases, she referred to SS  (Nigeria)
    [2013] EWCA Civ 550 and paragraph 46 of Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60.  The
    judge herself stated on two occasions (at [27] and [36]) that there was
    a "high" public interest in the present case by  virtue  of  Mrs  R-D's
    offending. In respect of the very compelling  circumstances  test,  the
    judge correctly directed herself to NA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA  Civ  662
    and HA (Iraq) [2020] EWCA Civ 1176 as  regards  the  relevance  of  all
    factors, including those which have been considered under either of the
    two exceptions in sections 117C(4) and (5). I  am  satisfied  that  the
    judge was  fully  aware  of  the  stringency  of  the  very  compelling
    circumstances test, and indeed  nothing  in  the  grounds  asserts  the
    contrary.

13. In respect of the point sought to be made at paragraph 6 of the grounds
    of appeal, there is no inconsistency  between  the  judge's  conclusion
    that the unduly harsh test was not met the one hand, and her subsequent
    conclusion that very compelling circumstances existed. As is clear from
    the case-law to which the  judge  specifically  directed  herself,  all
    factors in a case, including those relevant  to  one  or  both  of  the
    exceptions, can also be taken into  account  when  considering  section
    117C(6). The fact that there was no  "near  miss"  in  respect  of  the
    unduly harsh test does not somehow preclude consideration  of  to  that
    issue being put into the balancing exercise along with others.

14. The judge dealt with the previous decision of Judge Afako properly  and
    in accordance with the Devaseelan principles. Indeed, she  dedicated  a
    specific section of a decision to this and made numerous references  to
    Judge  Afako's  decision  when  setting  out  her  own   findings   and
    conclusions. The judge clearly  stated  that  there  was  new  evidence
    and/or further developments within the family which permitted  her,  in
    respect   of   certain   issues,   to   depart   from   the    previous
    findings/conclusions. There is no error here.

15. In summary, I conclude that the judge directed herself correctly in law
    as to all relevant matters in the appeal before her.

16. I turn to the reasons challenge. In my judgment, the points  raised  in
    paragraph 8(a)-(e) of the grounds of appeal do not disclose a  lack  of
    adequate reasons by the judge and are, in truth, simply a  disagreement
    with her analysis. The judge addressed a number of factors, not all  of
    which related to the unduly harsh issue, as she was entitled to do. The
    reasons set out at [40]-[46] are sustainable. Importantly, at [43], the
    judge emphasised  that  she  was  considering  the  factors  "in  their
    entirety" and having regard to their "holistic  effect".  By  contrast,
    the grounds of appeal appear to me to be  artificially  separating  out
    the relevant considerations.

17. Whilst the position of Mrs R-D's adult son, D, might not have attracted
    as much weight  as  other  matters,  in  my  view  the  judge  made  it
    sufficiently clear that it was Mrs R-D's "crucial role "in  the  family
    dynamic as a whole which led to her ultimate  conclusion  on  the  very
    compelling circumstances issue. This included the  important  emotional
    role she  played  in  respect  of  her  mother's  dementia.  Thus,  the
    possibility of social services input, whilst relevant, did  not  go  to
    undermine the judge's reasoning. In respect of Mr D, the judge was  not
    simply relying on his relationship with Mrs R-D, but on  his  inability
    to take on the wider familial responsibilities in  her  absence.  D-J's
    situation was also adequately reasoned and the judge  was  entitled  to
    conclude support provided by Mrs  R-D  was  a  relevant  consideration,
    amongst a number of others.

18. The grounds of appeal  make  reference  to  Mrs  R-D's  niece,  Kiesha,
    suggesting that the judge erred by  specifically  failing  to  consider
    what she might be able to do for the family in the future. I note  that
    this individual did not feature in the considerations of Judge Afako in
    his 2015 decision, nor does she appear  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision  letter.  It  is  apparent  that  it  was  not   regarded   as
    representing a significant individual as regards the  overall  familial
    environment. Further, I see that she was mentioned  by  Mr  D  in  oral
    evidence before the judge. I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge  had  all
    relevant evidence in mind when reaching her conclusions.  Even  if  the
    judge should have specifically  considered  Kiesha  (about  whom  there
    seemed to be virtually no evidence), I am satisfied that it  could  not
    have had a  material  bearing  on  the  outcome.  The  judge's  overall
    conclusion was based on a number of interlinking  factors  relating  to
    practical care and emotional support provided by Mrs R-D  to  at  least
    four other  family  members,  including  a  minor  and  a  mother  with
    dementia.

19. The final point raised in the grounds of appeal relates to the issue of
    the risk of reoffending. It is said that the judge placed weight  on  a
    low-risk assessment undertaken in an OASys  report,  but  in  doing  so
    failed to have regard to the fact that Mrs R-D had  continued  to  deny
    full responsibility for her offending.

20. This challenge is  misconceived.  At  [35],  the  judge  make  specific
    reference to the Sentencing Judge's remarks and the  actual  nature  of
    Mrs R-D's involvement in the fraud. In the  next  paragraph  the  judge
    went on to state:

           "36. While I note that [Mrs R-D]'s acceptance of her guilt  goes
           beyond what the evidence was before IJ Afako, I note there  were
           still aspects of her evidence which indicated she did not accept
           the sentencing judge's views, specifically regarding the  length
           of her offending and the benefit  she  received.  I  do  not  go
           behind the sentencing judge's view of the offences  and  I  find
           that the public interest in her deportation is high."

    She could not have been much clearer.

21. The complaint raised in the grounds of appeal is that the judge  failed
    to follow this through when considering the relevance  of  an  assessed
    low risk of reoffending and courses undertaken in prison. However, [46]
    reads as follows:

           "46. I also give some regard to the Oasys assessment of [Mrs  R-
           D] which assessed her at a low risk of reoffending. I take  into
           account the positive work she completed while in custody and the
           courses she undertook. Although these matters are certainly  not
           definitive or can be regarded as carrying material weight,  they
           are of some relevance."

22. A sensible reading of that paragraph is that the judge was not  placing
    "material" weight on these matters. The reference to  "some  relevance"
    can only, again on a sensible reading, lead one to the conclusion  that
    the matters did not have a  material  impact  on  the  judge's  overall
    conclusion. When [46] is read together with what the judge said at [35]
    and [36], I am satisfied that all relevant matters were considered,  no
    irrelevant matters were left out of account, and the judge did not  her
    in the manner claimed in the grounds of appeal.

23. There is a final matter to be considered.  During  the  course  of  his
    submissions, Mr Tufan appeared to be trying to introduce a  rationality
    challenge against the judge's decision. When I pressed him  to  clarify
    his position, he indicated that this was in fact the case and that such
    an error "jumped out from the papers". I took this to mean that he  was
    making a formal application to amend the Secretary of State grounds  of
    appeal. I refused that application for the following reasons.

24. It was far too late in the day for such an application to  be  made.  I
    make no criticism of Mr Tufan personally, but the  Secretary  of  State
    must ensure either that grounds of appeal are initially drafted  so  as
    to cover all proposed challenges, or that, on reflection, and prior  to
    a hearing, an application to amend the grounds is made to the  Tribunal
    and with the other party put on notice.

25. Further, if indeed a perversity challenge was as obvious  as  suggested
    by Mr Tufan, it is very difficult to see why the author of the original
    grounds did not include it.

26. In any event, even  if  I  had  permitted  reliance  on  an  additional
    perversity ground, I would have rejected it. Whilst  other  judges  may
    have come to a different conclusion on the same facts, the judge in the
    present case was entitled to find that  very  compelling  circumstances
    existed: that was within the range of rational  responses.  A  generous
    approach does not necessarily equate with a legally erroneous approach.

27. In light of the foregoing, there are no errors of law  in  the  judge's
    decision.



Anonymity


28. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction and I have
    not been asked to make one at this stage. In all the circumstances, I
    see no need to make such a direction.



Notice of Decision

29. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.


30. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
