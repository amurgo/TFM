Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:          Mr P Ahmed, instructed by M & K Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The Respondent is a citizen of Sri Lanka born  on  30th  August  1989.
      His appeal against the refusal of  entry  clearance  was  allowed,  on
      Article 8 grounds, by the First-tier Tribunal in a determination dated
      28th March 2014. The Secretary of  State  applied  for  permission  to
      appeal.

2.    Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge R A  Cox
      on the grounds that it was arguable  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Cockrill had failed to apply Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules -  correct
      approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) and had simply carried  out  a  'free-
      wheeling' Article 8 assessment.

3.    Mr Duffy relied on the grounds of appeal and submitted that the  Judge
      had failed to apply Gulshan. The  Respondent  could  not  satisfy  the
      maintenance requirements and there were no compelling factors in  this
      case. He could not meet the Rules on this  occasions  and  the  appeal
      should  have  been  dismissed.  There  was  nothing   preventing   the
      Respondent from making a successful application in the future.

4.    Mr Ahmed relied on the Rule 24 response and submitted that  the  Judge
      was correct to dismiss the appeal under the Rules. However, this  case
      was exceptional because the Sponsor was a refugee and had travelled to
      India to marry the  Respondent.  The  Judge  did  identify  compelling
      circumstances, at paragraphs 45 to 50, for the matter  to  be  allowed
      outside the Immigration Rules. His finding that the refusal  of  entry
      clearance was disproportionate was open to him on the evidence and the
      failure  to  refer  to  Gulshan  was  not  material.   It   would   be
      disproportionate to make another application because of the delay. The
      Respondent married in August 2012 and overseas  applications  were  on
      hold pending the case of MM.


Findings and conclusions

5.    In this case the Sponsor had not paid some of her wages into her  bank
      account. She was  paid  in  cash  and  used  the  money  for  everyday
      expenses. She did not have time to go to  the  bank  because  she  was
      doing two jobs. The Judge  accepted  the  Sponsor's  explanation,  but
      quite rightly, found that the specific requirements of Appendix  FM-SE
      of the Immigration Rules could not be met.

6.    The Judge accepted the Sponsor's explanation for the  missing  payslip
      and found that the reality of the situation was that the  Sponsor  was
      earning ï¿½18,600 and the arrival of  the  Respondent  would  not  bring
      about a situation where there was recourse to public funds.  The  case
      could  not  succeed  under  the  Rules  because  of  a  deficiency  in
      paperwork, rather than on substantive grounds.

7.    The Judge took into account the fact that the Sponsor  was  a  refugee
      and could not return to Sri Lanka.  The  Respondent  and  the  Sponsor
      could not live together elsewhere. Although, the Judge did  not  refer
      to Gulshan, he did identify compelling circumstances at paragraphs  45
      to 50  of  his  determination  so  as  to  render  any  error  of  law
      immaterial. The Judge's finding that the refusal  of  entry  clearance
      was disproportionate in the particular circumstances of the  case  was
      open to him on the  evidence  and  he  gave  cogent  reasons  for  his
      conclusions.

8.    The Judge made no error on any point of law which  might  require  the
      determination to be set aside. The appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
      dismissed.  The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  dated  28th
      March 2014 shall stand.
