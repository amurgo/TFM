                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.     This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge  Robert Britton), sitting at Hatton Cross on  12  July,
    to  an asylum and human rights  appeal by a Tamil citizen of Sri Lanka,
    born 18 May 1990.

 2. The grant of permission to appeal in the First-tier Tribunal turned  on
    differences noted by the judge in the history of what happened  to  him
    in detention given by  the  appellant  himself,  and  by  a  consultant
    psychiatrist, Dr Gavin  McKay.  Dr  McKay's  report  was  given  on  an
    independent basis; but he has a full-time appointment in  the  National
    Health Service. The judge alluded to these differences at paragraph 65:
    the question was on which days of a five-day  detention  the  appellant
    had been beaten. The permission judge  regarded  these  differences  as
    resolved by a subsequent statement by Dr McKay, and took the view  that
    this fresh evidence, apparently showed an  error  of  fact  capable  of
    amounting to one of law within E & R [2004] EWCA Civ 49, and should not
    be excluded on the basis of Ladd v, Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489, in view
    of the speed at which Dr McKay had had to produce his report.

 3. Without going  into  the  legal  niceties  of  the  permission  judge's
    decision, it is easy to see why he reached it: the discrepancy, such as
    it was, between Dr McKay's history and the  appellant's  own  seems  to
    have been based on the former counting, and the latter not counting the
    first evening, on which the appellant had been taken into custody, as a
    separate day. The hearing judge alluded to the point at paragraph 65 as
    one against the appellant, but his main reasons  for  disbelieving  him
    appear at paragraph 66; so it might have been possible to say that  the
    apparent mistake on the history made no material difference to those.

 4. However, there are three other grounds, on which the  permission  judge
    did not refuse permission, though he said they  had  relatively  little
    merit. On two of those I agree with him: the judge was  not  drawing  a
    general conclusion  on  the  likelihood  or  otherwise  of  bribery  at
    paragraph 66, but reaching a particular finding about whether or not it
    was likely in the rather unusual circumstances of this case, where  the
    appellant said he had been accused of involvement in a plot  to  kidnap
    the President's son: this he was well entitled to do. The  other  point
    involves the appellant's family history of migration, where  the  facts
    put forward in support of it if  anything  reinforce  the  judge's  own
    conclusions.

 5. The ground which causes me more trouble refers to the way in which  the
    judge dealt  with  Dr  McKay's  report  in  terms  of  the  appellant's
    credibility or otherwise. Apart  from  the  passages  relating  to  the
    history point, the judge did refer to the report at  paragraph  4,  but
    only to introduce it; and again at paragraph 41.  There  he  notes  the
    length of Dr McKay's interview with the appellant (2ï¿½ hours),  and  his
    reporting the lack of any history of mental illness in his  family,  of
    any past medical history based on what he said had happened to  him  in
    Sri Lanka, and of his current treatment, by way  of  a  low-dose  anti-
    depressant. At paragraph 67 the judge goes on to say this "I  find  the
    appellant's medical/mental condition is nothing to  do  with  what  had
    happened during the conflict in Sri Lanka".

 6. Dr McKay concluded at paragraph 153 of his report that  "The  Appellant
    has a clinical picture of  PTSD  typical  of  his  account  of  arrest,
    beating and the stress of a potential return  to  Sri  Lanka".  He  had
    already made it clear at paragraphs 103 - 104, with  reference  to  the
    Istanbul Protocol,  that  "typical"  would  be  the  highest  level  of
    consistency the nature of his own expertise would allow him to find  in
    an asylum case.

 7. This point was taken at paragraph 25 of the grounds of  appeal,  though
    without the reference to Dr McKay's report which might have  helped  to
    bring it to the permission judge's  attention.  Quite  clearly,  as  Mr
    Deller accepts, the judge needed to deal with Dr McKay's opinion on it,
    before  reaching  the  conclusion  he  did  at  paragraph  67,  or  his
    credibility findings. Whether he had ended by agreeing with it would of
    course have been for him.

 8. I have considered whether, even so,  the  judge's  conclusions  on  the
    bribery point are enough to validate his decision as a whole. It  is  a
    strong enough one for it to be very tempting to say so.  On  the  other
    hand, it is hard to say that this appellant had a fair  hearing  before
    the judge, when the judge's decision, whether he meant to do so or not,
    makes it look as if he picked out the points in Dr McKay's report which
    went against him, without dealing with its strong  conclusions  in  his
    favour. Judges are  most  certainly  not  required  to  accept  without
    question even strong conclusions  expressed  by  a  respectable  expert
    witness; but they do need to deal with them, if justice is to  be  seen
    to be done. For this reason, there  will  be  a  fresh  hearing  before
    another judge in the First-tier Tribunal.
