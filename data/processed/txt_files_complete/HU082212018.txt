                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity

1.    The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity order to safeguard the
      interests of the child concerned. I have not been invited to rescind
      the order. The order is appropriate and continues.



Background


2.    This is the Entry Clearance Officer's (ECO) appeal from  the  decision
of First-tier Tribunal Judge J S Burns (the judge)  promulgated  on  23  May
2019 allowing the appeal of CNB (the Claimant) against  the  ECO's  decision
refusing her application for entry clearance to join her husband in the  UK.



3.    The claimant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic  of  Congo  (DRC)
born on 23 February 1993. She is married to a British  citizen  present  and
settled in the UK (the sponsor). They have a  young  child  who  is  also  a
British citizen but who is residing with the  Claimant  in  France.  At  the
date of hearing before the judge the Claimant was about to give birth  to  a
second child. There was no dispute about the family relationship(s), and  it
was accepted  that  the  sponsor  visited  the  Claimant  and  his  daughter
frequently in Paris and financially supported them.

4.    The sole live issue before the judge  was  that  of  suitability,  all
other matters in dispute being resolved by the evidence filed on appeal.


5.    The refusal on the grounds of suitability  related  to  the  issue  of
deception.  On  27  December  2016  the  Claimant  was  apprehended  by   an
immigration officer when she attempted to enter the UK to visit the  sponsor
using a Belgium identity card that did not belong to her.  She  was  refused
entry under paragraph 320(7A) of the Immigration Rules (the Rules)  and  was
subject to a re-entry ban of a year pursuant to paragraph  320(7B)  thereof.
Following the expiration of that period, on 4  January  2018,  the  Claimant
made an application to join the sponsor in the UK the refusal of  which  was
the subject of the appeal before the judge.

6.    In this application the Claimant denied that she  had  been  known  by
another name and denied that she had been refused entry to  the  UK  in  the
last ten years. That led the ECO to refuse the  application  on  suitability
grounds.


7.    The judge heard evidence from the sponsor. The judge  found  that  the
sponsor knowingly funded the purchase of the identity card for the  purposes
of attempting deception and rejected the explanation that the answers  given
in the application was an innocent mistake.


8.    The judge found that the invocation of paragraph 320(7A)  by  the  ECO
was indeed correct and that  the  Claimant  could  not  therefore  meet  the
requirements of the Rules.  The  judge  then  embarked  on  a  consideration
outside of the Rules contrary to Article 8 of  the  ECHR  as  required.  The
judge answered the first four questions in Razgar  v  SSHD  [2004]  UKHL  27
affirmatively and accordingly the issue in the appeal boiled  down  to  that
of proportionality.


9.    The judge observed that the Claimant's rights and that of  her  family
were to be balanced against the public interest [31] and  further  noted  at
[32], by reference to section 117B(1) of  the  Nationality  Immigration  and
Asylum Act 2002, that the maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is
in the public interest. The  judge  acknowledged  at  [33]  the  aggravating
features of the Claimant's deception and  recognised  that  "allowing  entry
clearance in these circumstances does undermine immigration control and  set
a bad example". (sic)

10.   The judge took into account that the sponsor had  resided  in  the  UK
for twenty-three years. He was in full-time employment and lived  in  rented
accommodation. The judge found that it was open to the sponsor  to  live  in
France or the DRC with his family but concluded  that  it  was  unreasonable
and impractical to expect  him  to  do  either  [39]  given  his  length  of
residence in the  UK,  the  considerable  disruption  in  his  personal  and
working  life  if  he  were  required  to  uproot  himself  with   financial
consequences for his family.


11.   The judge observed that the refusal of entry clearance  would  prolong
the separation between the  sponsor  and  his  young  family  and  that  any
further  application  may  be  refused  on  mandatory  grounds   which   was
unjustifiably harsh. The judge considered that  the  Claimant  had  suffered
for her mistakes and to keep the family apart was not in the best  interests
of the child who was British and whose interests were served by  being  able
to live with both parents. Accordingly, the  judge  found  that  the  public
interest was outweighed  by  family  and  private  life  considerations  and
concluded that the refusal of entry clearance was disproportionate [44].


Discussion


12.   The principal arguments advanced on behalf of the  ECO  are  that  the
judge erred in law by failing to set out  the  extent  of  the  family  life
between the Claimant and her sponsor and  so,  failed  to  provide  adequate
reasons why there was an interference in that family  life  and,  failed  to
identify any exceptional circumstances that would  justify  a  finding  that
refusal was disproportionate.

13.   First-tier Tribunal Judge O' Brien in granting permission stated  that
"it was at least arguable that the  judge  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
public interest when finding that refusal was disproportionate."

14.   It is not correct to assert that the  judge  failed  to  set  out  the
extent of family life  between  the  Claimant  and  sponsor  and  failed  to
provide adequate reasons for finding that there  was  an  interference  with
family life. The judge was assessing the circumstances of a young family  at
the heart of which was a British child whose British father had been  living
in  the  UK  for  a  significant  period.  The  judge  found  that  it   was
unreasonable to expect the sponsor to leave the UK to continue  family  life
elsewhere. The judge further noted that the sponsor frequently  visited  the
Claimant and his daughter in Paris. There is no challenge to these  findings
of fact much of which appear to have been uncontentious  before  the  judge.
It is thus clear why the judge concluded that there was family life  and  an
interference with it.

15.   The grounds assert that the judge was wrong to  find  an  interference
on the basis that the refusal prevented the British child from entering  the
UK to join the sponsor at [29], but this fails to recognise that  the  judge
was considering the reality of the situation faced by  this  family  with  a
young child who was likely to be dependant on the mother  for  care.  In  my
judgement reading the decision as  a  whole  the  judge  viewed  this  as  a
"practical bar" to the child returning to the UK in light of the reality  of
the situation faced by the family.

16.   Looking at the decision as a whole, I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge
gave adequate reasons for his findings, and that it was open to him to  find
that the refusal caused an interference with family life.

17.   Further, it is incorrect  to  say,  as  referenced  in  the  grant  of
permission, that the judge arguably failed to  have  regard  to  the  public
interest. The judge was acutely aware of the circumstances relating  to  the
use of a false document in 2016 and the false representations made  in  2018
and considered the public interest  with  that  fully  in  mind.  The  judge
referred to the public interest and to the  fact  that  immigration  control
was undermined where there was deception at [31] to [33] describing this  as
a "serious attack on immigration control"  and  was  mindful  that  allowing
entry clearance in these circumstances undermined  immigration  control  and
sets a bad example [33]. It is plain from this that the judge was  aware  of
the weighty consideration to be given to the public interest, and that  this
was at the forefront of his mind during his consideration.

18.   Mr Kotas acknowledged that the judge did in fact refer to  the  public
interest but submitted that it was "inadequate"  and  criticised  the  judge
for failing to  specifically  record  that  he  had  attached  "considerable
weight" to the public interest: see ï¿½ 40 of Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11.

19.   In light of what the judge stated at [31] to [33] I do not  find  this
to be a fair criticism of him. Whilst the  judge  did  not  expressly  state
that he attached "considerable weight" to the public  interest,  it  is  not
necessarily a phrase that the judge has to give lip service to, but  rather,
he is required to demonstrate that he was aware of the  significance  to  be
attached to the  public  interest  in  the  balancing  exercise  and  attach
appropriate weight to it. I am satisfied that that is  what  the  judge  did
and that he did not  lose  sight  of  his  finding  that  the  Claimant  had
knowingly  employed  deception  on   two   occasions   in   conducting   his
proportionality assessment.

20.   The core issue in the appeal was whether the decision  to  refuse  the
claimant entry clearance was a disproportionate interference with the  right
to respect for family life.  The  judge  placed  various  factors  into  the
balance on either side including the possibility of the sponsor living  with
his family in France and the DRC. Whilst I acknowledge that the factors  the
judge referred to at [40] as to the possible eventualities of a refusal  are
speculative, the underlying reasons for the judge allowing the  appeal,  are
notwithstanding clear. These  included  the  best  interests  of  a  British
child, the sponsor's established private life in the  UK  developed  over  a
significant period and the unreasonableness of expecting him  to  leave  the
UK and the considerable disruption this would cause to his family  who  were
reliant on him for financial support.

21.   Not every judge would have reached the same decision  and  it  may  be
that the Claimant is the beneficiary of a generous decision  by  the  judge.
That said, the function of the Upper  Tribunal  is  not  to  make  a  second
decision based on the evidence but to enquire whether there is any error  of
law in the approach adopted by the First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  justice
requires it to be set aside. I do not consider that  there  is  anything  in
the decision to suggest that the judge's approach  was  other  than  on  all
fours with the proper legal framework.

22.   It therefore follows that this appeal is dismissed.


Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed, and the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
affirmed.
