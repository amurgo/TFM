                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Lesego Olivia Pule, was born on 16 July 1974  and  is  a
    citizen of Botswana.  The appellant had applied for leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom on the basis of the length of her residence in  this
    country and under Article 8 ECHR.  There was some debate at the hearing
    as to when she made her application and how  the  date  of  application
    might affect the Immigration  Rules  applied  but,  recent  changes  in
    relevant  jurisprudence  have  rendered  that   debate   otiose.    Her
    application was, in any event, refused by the respondent on 14 May 2013
    under paragraph 276ADE of HC 395 (as amended).

 2. Her appeal came before Judge Cameron sitting at  Taylor  House  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal on 3 March 2014.  In a determination promulgated on
    14 March 2014, he dismissed the appeal.  However, he did conclude that,
    contrary to the  contents  of  the  respondent's  refusal  letter,  the
    appellant's application fell to be  considered  under  the  Immigration
    Rules which pertained prior to 9 July 2012.  [36] He therefore assessed
    her long residence on the basis that she had to meet a  minimum  period
    of residence of fourteen years (which the appellant claims she was able
    to satisfy).  The refusal letter of the respondent at  [12]  considered
    that the appellant had made her application on 18 July 2012, after  the
    change of Rules on 9 July.  She therefore had to meet the  new  twenty-
    year period of continuous residence in the  United  Kingdom,  a  period
    which she is, by any analysis of the evidence,  incapable  of  meeting.
    It was not argued before the Upper Tribunal that she  met  any  of  the
    exceptions to the "new" Rules.

 3. The lengthy submissions regarding the date on which the appellant  made
    her application have been rendered academic  by  the  judgment  of  the
    Court of Appeal in Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 74.  The Court of Appeal  held
    at [56] as follows:
    The foregoing analysis has regrettably been somewhat dense, but I can
    summarise my conclusion, and the reasons for it, as follows:
      (1) When HC 194 first came into force on 9 July 2012, the Secretary of
      State was not entitled to take into account the provisions of the new
      Rules (either directly or by treating them as a statement of her
      current policy) when making decisions on private or family life
      applications made prior to that date but not yet decided. That is
      because, as decided in Edgehill, "the implementation provision" set
      out at para. 7 above displaces the usual Odelola principle.
      (2) But that position was altered by HC 565 - specifically by the
      introduction of the new paragraph A277C - with effect from 6 September
      2012. As from that date the Secretary of State was entitled to take
      into account the provisions of Appendix FM and paragraphs 276ADE-276DH
      in deciding private or family life applications even if they were made
      prior to 9 July 2012. The result is that the law as it was held to be
      in Edgehill only obtained as regards decisions taken in the two-month
      window between 9 July and 6 September 2012.
      (3) Neither of the decisions with which we are concerned in this case
      fell within that window. Accordingly the Secretary of State was
      entitled to apply the new Rules in reaching those decisions.




 4. Even if the appellant had made  her  application  before  9  July  2012
    (which is by no means certain) the decision of the respondent was taken
    after 6 September 2012 when HC 565 came into effect.  Consequently, her
    application fell to be considered under "new" Rules, including  the  20
    year provision.

 5. In those circumstances, the appellant's appeal is dismissed.

NOTICE OF DECISION

This appeal is dismissed.







Signed                              Date 28 February 2015
