                                  DECISION

    1. This appeal was heard by a Deputy Judge  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
       Field House on 2 June 2016.  As explained in the Tribunal's letter to
       the parties dated 11 August 2016,  the  judge  has  been  unwell  and
       unable to complete his written decision.

    2. At a hearing before me on 26 September 2016 the parties  agreed  that
       Judge Archer had given a decision orally  on  2  June  2016,  to  the
       effect that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  was  to  be  set
       aside and that the appeal would be remitted back  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal for a decision to re-made afresh.

    3. Rule 40(1) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
       provides that the Upper Tribunal may give  a  decision  orally  at  a
       hearing.  Rule 40(3) provides that the Upper  Tribunal  must  provide
       written reasons for its decision with a decision  notice  unless  the
       parties have consented to  the  Upper  Tribunal  not  giving  written
       reasons.

    4. At the hearing the parties consented to  waive  the  requirement  for
       written reasons in this case.

    5. In the circumstances, pursuant to the decision given orally by  Judge
       Archer on 2 June 2016, the FtT's decision contains an  error  of  law
       and is set aside. The appeal is remitted  to  the  FtT  to  determine
       afresh.


Signed                                  Date 26 September 2016


Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor
