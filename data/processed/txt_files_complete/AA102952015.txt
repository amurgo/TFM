Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Greer, Solicitor, Broudie Jackson Canter
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Libya born on 26th June 1981.

2.   He first applied to enter the United Kingdom as a student on  5th  July
    2005, and that application was refused, but  a  second  application  on
    22nd July, 2005, was successful and he was granted leave to enter as  a
    student on a visa issued on 24th Jul, 2005 valid to 24th January, 2006.
     He was granted further periods  of  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom until 25th November 2014, when his visa expired.

3.    On  30th  December  2014,  the  appellant  claimed  asylum  and   that
    application was considered by the respondent and on 19th June 2015, was
    refused.

4.   The appellant appealed and his appeal was heard by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge M Sharkett sitting at Manchester on 7th November 2016.  The judge
    dismissed the appellant's asylum  appeal,  dismissed  his  humanitarian
    protection appeal and dismissed his human rights appeal.   However,  in
    doing so, the judge refers on no less than three occasions to the wrong
    standard of proof.  The judge correctly sets out the standard of  proof
    at paragraph 51 of the determination, but then at paragraphs 76, 79 and
    80 she makes reference to "on the balance of probabilities".

5.   I indicated to the representatives my preliminary  view  was  that  the
    determination could not stand.  I emphasised that I had not reached any
    conclusions and was more than happy  to  be  persuaded  otherwise.   Mr
    Diwnycz indicated to me that he agreed that the determination could not
    stand and that it should be remitted to the hearing by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  There is  a  suggestion  that  the  judge  appears  to  have
    required corroboration at paragraph 67, but what she says at  paragraph
    67 is factually correct and is not an example of the judge calling  for
    corroboration.

6.   Because of the fundamental errors in the determination acknowledged  by
    the Home Office Presenting Officer, I have no alternative but to set it
    aside and remit it for hearing afresh by the First-tier  Tribunal.   An
    Arabic interpreter will be required.
