Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Kirk, Counsel, instructed by Abbott Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss H Horsley, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant, who was born on 9 June 1988, is a citizen  of  Pakistan.
    He entered this country on 25 January 2010 with entry  clearance  as  a
    student, which expired on 29 February 2012.  The day before  this  visa
    expired, on 28 February 2012, he applied for further leave to remain as
    a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant pursuant to paragraph 245ZX  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 2. In support of this application the appellant submitted  a  Confirmation
    of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) for a professional  higher  diploma  in
    tourism and hospitality at Lincoln's College London, but this college's
    licence was revoked by the respondent on 23 May 2012.

 3. Following this revocation, on 22 June 2012, the respondent wrote to the
    appellant telling him that the licence of Lincoln's  College  had  been
    revoked, but that before a final decision was made,  in  light  of  the
    respondent's  rules  and  guidance,  the   respondent   would   suspend
    consideration of his application for a period of sixty  calendar  days.
    The appellant was told that within this time, if he obtained a new  CAS
    for a course of study at a fully licensed Tier 4 education sponsor, the
    respondent would then consider  an  application  by  him  to  vary  the
    grounds of his original application.

 4. Thereafter, the appellant secured a place at  another  college  (London
    School of Technology, Middlesex) and on 24 August 2012  his  solicitors
    wrote to the respondent enclosing some of the documentation  which  had
    been  submitted  with  the  original  application  and  re-applied  for
    "extension/switching his Tier 4 (General) Student  visa  with  the  new
    sponsor".

 5. This application was then considered  by  the  respondent,  but  on  16
    November 2012, the respondent refused the application on the basis that
    the appellant had failed to meet the maintenance requirements under the
    Immigration Rules.

 6. At the same time  as  making  her  decision  refusing  the  appellant's
    application,  the  respondent  also  made  a  decision  to  remove  the
    appellant by way of directions under Section  47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006.    Both   these   decisions   were
    communicated to the appellant in the  refusal  letter  of  16  November
    2012.  The appellant appealed against these decisions  and  his  appeal
    was heard before First-tier Tribunal Judge Oxlade,  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 29 April 2013.

 7. In a determination  prepared  on  22  May  2013,  and  promulgated  the
    following day, Judge Oxlade  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal,  both
    under the Immigration Rules and  under  Article  8.   Although  it  was
    submitted on behalf of the appellant that whatever the  decision  might
    be on the substantive appeal, the removal decision  under  Section  47,
    made  simultaneously,  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law,   this
    submission  was  not  dealt  with  in  Judge  Oxlade's   determination.
    However, in light of the  decision  which  I  make  below,  it  is  not
    necessary for me to deal with this aspect  of  the  appeal  separately.
    Hereafter, references to "the appeal" are references to the appellant's
    appeal against both the substantive decision and the removal  decision.



 8. The appellant has  appealed  against  this  decision  and  was  granted
    permission to appeal by Upper Tribunal Judge Renton (sitting as a Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal) on 25 June 2013.   Although  the  appellant
    has appealed under Article 8 as well as under the Rules, in light of my
    decision below, I do not need to consider this aspect of the appeal.

The Hearing

 9. It is common ground that with regard to the appeal under the Rules, the
    only issue between the parties was as to whether or not the maintenance
    requirements were satisfied.  The respondent did not and does not  seek
    to suggest that any of the other requirements under the Rules have  not
    been satisfied.  The appellant was  awarded  the  30  points  necessary
    under "Attributes - Confirmation of Acceptance for  Studies",  but  was
    awarded no points under "Maintenance (Funds)", because  the  respondent
    considered that a letter from United Bank confirming  that  his  mother
    had been issued with a loan was not acceptable  as  evidence  of  funds
    available to him because the letter was not in his name.

10. In the course of her determination, Judge Oxlade  found,  at  paragraph
    20, that "by Appendix 1B(c)"  (which  was  presumably  meant  to  be  a
    reference to Appendix C1B(c)) the funds held in overseas  accounts  had
    to be held in the appellant's name.  Because the funds  were  not,  she
    considered that the funds held  in  the  appellant's  mother's  account
    could not be relied upon.

11. In the course of his clear and cogent submissions,  Mr  Kirk  submitted
    that under Appendix C1B(a)(iii) an appellant was  specifically  allowed
    to rely on a bank statement in a parent's name, and that the judge  had
    accordingly been wrong to interpret Appendix C1B(c) (which in any event
    was not the paragraph relied upon) as requiring that funds be  held  in
    the appellant's name.  Accordingly, the judge had plainly erred in law.



12. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Horsley accepted that there had been an
    error of law in the determination.  First, Judge Oxlade had been  wrong
    as regards her findings under Appendix C1B(d) (although in the  context
    of the appellant's case this aspect of the submissions does not need to
    be developed).  Ms Horsley also accepted that Mr Kirk was right to  say
    that the appellant could rely  on  a  bank  statement  from  a  parent,
    although it was  the  respondent's  case  originally  that  these  bank
    statements had been properly excluded from consideration  because  they
    had not been submitted with the application  to  the  respondent.   So,
    although the appellant was right on the legal point, if  they  had  not
    been submitted with the original application, then they still could not
    be relied upon.

13. In reply, Mr Kirk submitted that  it  was  the  appellant's  case  that
    whether or not these  documents  had  been  resubmitted  with  a  later
    application in August, as a matter of fact they had been  submitted  on
    28 February 2012, as referred to at  paragraph  4  of  the  appellant's
    witness  statement  which  was  in  the  bundle  before  Judge  Oxlade.
    Further, there had been no  dispute  before  Judge  Oxlade  that  these
    statements had in fact been submitted.



Error of Law

14. It is clear that it was the appellant's case  that  his  mother's  bank
    statements had been submitted with the original  application  (this  is
    referred to at paragraph 4 of his  witness  statement  which  had  been
    before the judge).  As this bank account had the  equivalent  of  about
    �13,000 in it throughout the relevant period,  which  was  considerably
    more than the �1,600 necessary to satisfy the maintenance  requirement,
    if Judge Oxlade was to reject the application on  the  basis  that  the
    maintenance requirement had not been met, she needed to make a  finding
    that the statement had not in fact been submitted, which  she  did  not
    make.  Accordingly, I found that  the  determination  had  contained  a
    material error of law in the following terms:

         "It has been accepted on behalf  of  the  respondent  that  if  the
         appellant had submitted bank statements of his mother,  as  he  had
         claimed in his witness statement, at paragraph 4, this  would  have
         been relevant to the issue  of  whether  he  had  sufficient  funds
         available  and  the  judge  erred  by  finding  that  he  did  not.
         Accordingly, the judge's failure to make any finding as to  whether
         or not these  statements  had  been  submitted  with  the  original
         application, which was material to the  decision,  was  a  material
         error of law."

15. Accordingly, I found that Judge Oxlade's decision had to be  remade  by
    the Upper Tribunal, and I proceeded to hear evidence for this purpose.

16.  Before  hearing  evidence,  Ms  Horsley  accepted  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent that  if  on  the  evidence  it  was  established  that  the
    appellant's mother's  bank  statements  had  been  submitted  with  the
    original application, then the maintenance requirement under the  Rules
    would have been met.

17. I then heard evidence from the appellant, who was cross  examined.   He
    stated that he had submitted  the  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain on 28 February 2012, and that he  had  submitted  the  documents
    relating to his  mother's  bank  account  with  that  application.   He
    confirmed this in cross-examination, and Ms Horsley subsequently stated
    on behalf  of  the  respondent  that  she  made  no  challenge  to  the
    appellant's assertion that he did send in his mother's bank  statement,
    together with the original application.

18. On behalf of the respondent, in  the  course  of  her  submissions,  Ms
    Horsley accepted that the August application had not been treated as  a
    new application, and that the relevant date for the  purposes  of  this
    appeal was February 2012.  The consideration of  that  application  had
    effectively been  suspended  pending  receipt  of  further  information
    regarding an alternative college.  So if the Tribunal accepted that the
    appellant's mother's  bank  statements  had  been  submitted  with  the
    application in February, it would  seem  the  maintenance  requirements
    under the Rules had been satisfied.

19. Ms Horsley stated, correctly, that it was very likely that the  refusal
    of the application was not the fault of  whoever  had  dealt  with  the
    application in August, because it would appear that there had not  been
    a reference back to the documents which had been submitted  originally,
    but she accepted that as she could not challenge that the relevant bank
    statements had been submitted in February, the Tribunal's task was  not
    very difficult.

20. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Kirk  submitted  that  as  the  evidence
    showed that the mother's bank statements, together  with  an  affidavit
    from the appellant's mother confirming that these funds were  available
    for  the  appellant  had  been  submitted  with  the  application,  the
    maintenance requirements under the Rules had clearly been satisfied.

Discussion

21. In light of the evidence which I have heard, I am entirely satisfied on
    the balance of probabilities that the appellant did indeed  submit  the
    bank statements relating to his mother's bank account, together with an
    affidavit from his mother confirming that these  funds  were  available
    for his use, at the time he submitted his application in February 2012.



22. It follows  that  the  maintenance  requirement  under  the  Rules  was
    satisfied.  As it has been accepted that the other  requirements  under
    the Rules were satisfied, it follows that this appeal must be  allowed,
    and I will so find.

Decision

I set aside  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Oxlade  as
containing a material error of law, and substitute the following decision:

The appellant's appeal is allowed, under the Immigration Rules.
