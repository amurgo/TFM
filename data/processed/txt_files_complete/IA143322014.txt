                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Syed  Abaidullah  in  the  case  of  IA/14332/2014
    against a decision of Judge Taylor, who on  2nd  June  2014  heard  the
    Appellant's  appeal  in  respect  of  his  Tier  4  (General)   Student
    application made under the points-based system.  He had sought  further
    leave following his entry to the UK and his appeal was decided  at  his
    request on the papers.  Part of the reason for his appeal was  that  it
    had been maintained by the Secretary of State that a bank document that
    had been submitted by him did not contain the specified information.

 2. The Judge who decided the appeal on  examination  of  the  Respondent's
    bundle noted the bank statement which was under consideration and noted
    that it did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  because
    the name of the accountholder was not included on the document.  Having
    set out the terms of paragraph 245AA the Judge decided  that  the  bank
    statement was deficient but went on to find that he was satisfied  that
    under paragraph 245AA later submitted bank statements  which  contained
    the information could be considered as the original submitted document,
    as he said, was in the wrong format and did  not  contain  all  of  the
    required information.  On that basis the appeal was allowed.

 3. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought in the First-tier
    but refused and then renewed to the Upper Tribunal in grounds  of  18th
    September 2014.  In the renewed grounds reliance was placed on the case
    of Akhter and another (paragraph 245AA wrong format)  [2014]  UKUT  297
    (IAC) in which it was noted that a bank letter which does  not  specify
    the postal address, landline telephone number and email address of  the
    accountholders is not thereby in the wrong format for the  purposes  of
    paragraph 245AA of the  Immigration  Rules.   It  is  in  fact  missing
    information.

 4. The upshot of submissions made today is that it was accepted  that  the
    Judge was wrong to find that the document relied on was  in  the  wrong
    format because that is contrary to the decision  in  Akhter.   However,
    the  Judge's  alternative  finding  that  he  had  failed  to   contain
    information that was required was the correct finding.  That is  not  a
    point that the Secretary of State  may  contend  and  that  has  to  be
    correct.  The question now is what is the consequence of that  finding?
    There are two routes that are available at this point but both lead  to
    the same decision, which is that the decision is not in accordance with
    the law and it is therefore remitted to the Secretary of  State  for  a
    lawful finding or decision to be made on the information that has  been
    presented.  Accordingly I have set aside the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal made by  Judge  Taylor  on  20th  June  2014.   I  remake  the
    decision.  I find that the appeal is allowed to the extent that  it  is
    not in accordance with the law and I remit the case to the Secretary of
    State for a lawful decision to be made on the  documentation  that  has
    been submitted.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The appeal is allowed to the extent that it is not in  accordance  with  the
law, by agreement of both parties, the case is remitted to the Secretary  of
State for a lawful decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
