Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms V Mascord, Legal Representative, Lawrence Lupin
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr K Norton, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the DRC, born on 8  April  1991.   On  25
    October  2013  a  decision  was  made  by  the  respondent  to  make  a
    deportation order against the appellant under the automatic deportation
    provisions of the UK Borders Act  2007.   That  decision  followed  the
    appellant's convictions on 9 May 2012 for  offences  of  possession  of
    class A and B drugs with intent to supply,  for  which  he  received  a
    sentence on 17 May 2012 of three years and six months' imprisonment.

 2. The appellant appealed against that decision to the First-tier Tribunal
    and his appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Vaudin d'Im�court
    and First-tier Tribunal Judge Flynn at a hearing on 29 and  30  October
    2014.  The Panel of the First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal.

 3. One of the issues in the appeal concerned whether the  appellant  would
    be at risk on return to the DRC from  the  authorities,  as  a  foreign
    criminal.  It was, in summary, submitted that returning  the  appellant
    would give rise to a real risk of serious  harm  because  he  would  be
    identified as a foreign criminal and detained in conditions  likely  to
    give rise to inhuman or degrading treatment.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    rejected that contention.

 4. The sole ground of appeal against the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
    concerns its assessment of the risk on return in that specific regard.

    Submissions

 5. Ms Mascord relied on the  grounds  of  appeal.   She  referred  to  the
    decision in P v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]  EWHC
    3879 (Admin).   In  summary,  it  was  submitted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not deal with the arguments  advanced  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant in relation to  that  decision  and  did  not  give  adequate
    reasons for departing from it.  Reference  was  made  to  Phillips  J's
    findings  on  risk  in  that  decision,  with  reference  to   criminal
    deportees.  It was  submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  wrongly
    considered what Ms Mascord referred to as the 'OGN'  for  October  2014
    (and which the Panel described as a Bulletin), entitled  it  to  depart
    from the findings in P.  Submissions had been made  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as to what weight should be given  to  the  Bulletin  but  the
    First-tier Tribunal did not engage with those submissions.

 6. It was submitted that there were no reasons  as  to  why  the  Bulletin
    should  be  preferred  to  the  reasons  given  in  P.   Although   the
    respondent's 'rule 24'  response  relies  on  the  decision  in  BCT  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014]  EWHC  4265  (Admin),
    that is not a pertinent case given that it is a decision about unlawful
    detention.

 7. Mr Norton submitted that Phillips J gave his decision on the  basis  of
    the evidence that was before him.  However, the February 2014  Bulletin
    was a response to that decision and the October 2014 Bulletin added  to
    it.  The First-tier Tribunal came to the same decision, in  effect,  as
    that in BCT, albeit  that  that  decision  came  after  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision.

 8. In BCT it was concluded that the evidence did not  establish  the  risk
    contended for.  In any event, even without reference  to  BCT  the  new
    evidence did not show an Article 3 risk.

 9. In reply  Ms  Mascord  re-emphasised  the  submissions  given  earlier,
    reiterating that  it  is  difficult  to  extract  from  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's determination what the reasons were for its  conclusions  in
    terms of risk.  BCT was not considering the same test for  returns  and
    whether there was a real risk of harm.

10. It was further submitted that the issue of materiality of the error  of
    law is a live one given the pending country guidance case by the  Upper
    Tribunal on the DRC.

    My assessment

11. The sole ground of  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal concerns its conclusion to the effect that there would  be  no
    risk to the appellant on return to the DRC as a foreign  criminal.   In
    P, as quoted in detail by the First-tier Tribunal, Phillips J stated as
    follows:

    "52. In the case of criminal deportees to DRC, it is  clear  that  they
         will be interrogated on arrival, no doubt by professional,  skilled
         and experienced immigration officials.   According  to  the  French
         embassy, those officials are specifically looking out for  criminal
         deportees and no doubt able to probe for information and  look  for
         signs which would demonstrate that a returnee has  been  imprisoned
         in the United Kingdom.  There would  seem  to  be  an  obvious  and
         serious risk that a criminal deportee such as P would not  be  able
         to hide the fact of his convictions in the  face  of  interrogation
         designed to elicit that very fact.

    53.  Further, it must be assumed that immigration officials in the  DRC
         are able to conduct internet searches in relation to a person  they
         are interrogating.  There must be a real and substantial risk  that
         an offence which attracted a custodial sentence  of  12  months  or
         more (so as to give rise to automatic deportation) will  have  been
         reported  in  some  form,  even  if  the  case  did  not   generate
         substantial publicity.  It would not seem  to  matter  whether  DRC
         nationality was mentioned in any report if the  person  was  named.
         It is also relevant to note in this context  that  the  FFM  report
         recorded evidence from the police in Kinshasa that the DGM sends  a
         team to the United Kingdom to identify  Congolese  who  are  to  be
         returned to the DRC and that 'the same team who had identified them
         abroad (including the UK) welcome them here'.

    54.  In the light of the above discussion, and with considerable regret
         given the nature and extent of P's criminal record in this country,
         I am satisfied that P's application to revoke the Deportation Order
         made against him cannot be considered to be clearly unfounded.   As
         the Defendant's decision to the contrary  was  based  on  the  same
         undisputed evidence of the attitude of the DRC authorities which  I
         have considered, it necessarily follows that I find  that  decision
         to be irrational.  Indeed, in my  judgment  there  is  a  real  and
         substantial risk that P, in common with  other  criminal  deportees
         (who have served the sentences imposed on them for their crimes  in
         this country), would be subjected to further imprisonment and  ill-
         treatment if returned to the DRC."

12. The First-tier Tribunal pointed out at [122] that P  was  deciding  the
    issue of a "clearly unfounded" certificate in respect of an application
    to revoke a deportation order.  The First-tier Tribunal concluded  that
    Phillips J did not conclude that any foreign criminal would be at  risk
    on return to the DRC, merely that this was a "viable possibility" which
    should be decided in the light of the evidence.

13. Before the First-tier Tribunal a Home Office Bulletin dated 22  October
    2014 was relied on on behalf of  the  respondent.   The  Tribunal  made
    reference to some content of the Bulletin, in particular letters  dated
    October 2014 from the  British  Embassy  in  Kinshasa,  clarifying  the
    procedure on return to the DRC.  It quoted from Annex D.  As set out in
    the determination Annex D states as follows:

         "If an individual has committed a violent crime, for example sexual
         assault, DGM [Direction G�n�rale de  Migration]  will  record  this
         information so that if a  crime  is  later  committed  in  DRC,  an
         investigation can be carried out to determine whether it is  linked
         to the person who is returned.  Certain countries have data sharing
         arrangements with DGM in which they  provide  this  information  on
         those who they are returning.   This  will  not  prevent  DGM  from
         allowing that person back into the country.  Because the person has
         not committed a crime in the DRC, they are free to go."

14. At [110] the Tribunal gave a detailed summary of the  submissions  made
    on behalf of the appellant in relation to the Bulletin, the decision in
    P, and her arguments in terms of the extent to which the information in
    the Bulletin revealed  that  there  was  no  risk  to  persons  in  the
    appellant's situation, and no risk to the appellant in particular.

15. At [123] the Panel noted that Ms Mascord submitted that the Bulletin of
    22 October 2014 was new evidence to which  the  Panel  should  give  no
    weight but it disagreed with her submission.  As already indicated, the
    Panel referred to Annex D of the Bulletin, and at [125] stated that  on
    behalf of the appellant there was no evidence to counter  the  contents
    of Annex D.

16. The Panel rejected the suggestion that P was binding on it.   It  noted
    that it was a "relevant authority" which it had  considered  carefully.
    The Panel concluded that Phillips J did not  decide  that  all  foreign
    criminals returned to  the  DRC  have  a  real  risk  of  detention  in
    conditions that breach Article 3, stating that his  decision  was  that
    the argument could not be said to be 'clearly unfounded'.

17. With specific reference to the appellant before them, it was noted that
    the appellant's offences were not violent and did  not  extend  to  any
    criminal activity in the DRC.  It concluded that there were  no  strong
    grounds to conclude that he would  face  a  real  risk  of  torture  or
    inhuman or degrading treatment on return  to  the  DRC.   Although  the
    appellant had said that a DRC official in the UK  had  been  unable  to
    provide a guarantee of his safety (when he was interviewed)  the  Panel
    concluded that a guarantee of safety is not an appropriate standard  or
    yardstick.

18. I do not consider that there is any error of law in the terms  advanced
    on behalf of the appellant with respect to the First-tier Tribunal  not
    having articulated in detail its reasons for rejecting the  submissions
    made on behalf of the appellant concerning the  Bulletin.   As  already
    indicated, the Panel set out a detailed summary of the submissions made
    on  behalf  of  the  appellant  and  in  my  judgement  it  could   not
    realistically be said that the Panel did not have  those  arguments  in
    mind in reasoning that the appellant would not be at risk on return for
    the reasons advanced.  It is plain that the Panel did engage  with  the
    issue with reference to the decision in P,  the  further  material  put
    before it, and the arguments advanced on behalf of the  appellant.   It
    was not necessary for the Panel to  deal  specifically  with  each  and
    every strand of the arguments advanced.

19. In the grounds before the Upper Tribunal there  is  a  summary  of  the
    arguments that it is said undermine the information in the October 2014
    Bulletin.  However, even if it could be said that the  Panel  erred  in
    law by  not  explaining  more  fully  its  reasons  for  rejecting  the
    arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant, that is not an error  of
    law which requires the decision to be  set  aside.   The  Tribunal  was
    entitled to conclude on the basis of the evidence put before  it,  that
    the appellant would not be at risk of Article 3 ill-treatment on return
    to the DRC.

20. Relevant to the question of the materiality of any error of law made by
    the First-tier Tribunal, is the decision in BCT.   In  that  case  Neil
    Garnham QC, sitting as  a  Deputy  High  Court  Judge,  considered  the
    decision in P and what it said about the risk to foreign  criminals  on
    return to the DRC.  At [42] he stated as follows:

         "It is right, as Mr Waite submits, that the issue in the  case  was
         whether the Secretary of State's certificate to the effect that P's
         claim was 'clearly unfounded' was flawed; it was not a decision  on
         the merits of P's Article 3 EHCR argument.  Technically,  Mr  Waite
         is right to assert that the decision was obiter as to the  question
         of whether there was, in fact, a real risk  of  ill-treatment  upon
         return."

21. At [43] he said that in  the  absence  of  new  evidence  it  would  be
    necessary to assume that P would be detained on return to DRC and  that
    he would be imprisoned or detained in or near  Kinshasa  and  that  his
    detention would be a breach of Article 3.  He considered  then  whether
    the Secretary of State had obtained new evidence of  sufficient  weight
    to make a reassessment of the conditions on likely return possible  and
    justifiable.  He then referred to the February 2014 DRC Policy Bulletin
    and its contents.

22. One of the points made in the  grounds  before  me  was  also  advanced
    before the judge in BCT, as indicated at [48] of that decision,  namely
    the issue of an anonymous source  at  the  DGM.  In  relation  to  that
    argument and others, the judge concluded that since the quashing of the
    certificate in P's case, the  Secretary  of  State  had  obtained  what
    amounts to assurances at a senior level  in  the  Congolese  government
    that the management of  returning  foreign  national  offenders  is  no
    different from the management of returning failed asylum-seekers, about
    whom there had previously been no concerns.  At  [51]  the  'anonymity'
    argument was rejected.

23. Finally, at [55] it was stated that the decision in P  meant  that  the
    Secretary of State had  to  consider  her  position  and  reassess  the
    evidence as to the consequences of a  return  to  the  DRC.   Within  a
    relatively short period of time new material had emerged,  notably  the
    discussion between the Foreign Office and the Directeur Central  de  la
    Chancellerie at the DGM which suggested that the position may not be as
    concerning as the Ambassador had described.  Thereafter,  there  was  a
    realistic prospect of effective removals to the DRC and,  in  fact,  in
    October 2014 such removals commenced.

24. Although it is true that that  case  of  BCT  was  concerned  with  the
    question of the legality of detention, by the same token  the  decision
    in P was concerned with a  "clearly  unfounded"  certificate.   In  any
    event, whilst the  decision  in  BCT  was  not  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in the appeal with which I  am  concerned,  its  decision  and
    consideration of what seems to be  identical  evidence,  reinforces  my
    view that even if there was an error of law by the First-tier  Tribunal
    it is not an error of law that  is  material  to  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal.

25. Ms Mascord suggested that the question of materiality  ought  to  await
    the outcome  of  the  expected  country  guidance  case  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  However, I do not  agree  with  that  proposition.   Putting
    aside my primary view which is that there is no error  of  law  in  the
    decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  even  on  the   question   of
    materiality that is an issue that can be resolved with reference to the
    evidence that was before the First-tier  Tribunal,  and  should  be  so
    resolved.  What the Upper Tribunal may or may not decide in a  decision
    yet to be promulgated at some uncertain time in the future,  is  not  a
    basis for deferring the question of materiality.

    Decision

26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point  of  law.   The  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal
    therefore stands.
