                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. Although it is a Secretary of State who is appealing in these
      proceedings for convenience I will hereinafter refer to the parties as
      in the First tier Tribunal.


   2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 21 July 1983.

   3. He came to the United Kingdom on 4 September 2012 with leave as a
      student, valid until 20 December 2011. On 30 December 2011 he applied
      for further leave which was granted until 4 May 2013. On 4 May 2013 he
      again applied for further leave which was granted until 15 May 2015.
      With both of these applications he submitted a TOEIC certificate from
      the Educational Testing Service (ETS). The certificate indicated it
      was granted after the appellant sat a test in English on the 16th
      November 2011 at Portsmouth International College in London.

   4. His leave as a student was curtailed on 7 July 2014, effective from 18
      October 2014. That day he applied for leave outside the rules which
      was refused on 14 January 2015. His appeal was dismissed, permission
      to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused and he became appeal
      rights exhausted on 21 January 2016.

   5. On 24 May 2016 he applied for leave to remain on the basis of family
      life. The appellant had married Mrs Farhat Batool, a British national
      on 22 April 2016.

   6. This was refused on 1 January 2017. The respondent accepts that the
      relationship was genuine and subsisting. However, ETS had checked the
      records held of his speaking test in English using voice recognition
      software. Following this, his scores were cancelled on the basis the
      test was taken by proxy. The decision maker concluded he had
      fraudulently obtained the certificate submitted with his two student
      visa applications. Such conduct was not conducive to the public good
      and his application was refused on suitability grounds.

   7. His appeal against that decision was heard by Judge of the First tier
      Tribunal Hindson sitting at North Shields on 13 November 2017. In a
      decision promulgated on 14 November 2017 the appeal was allowed on
      human rights grounds. The respondent was not represented at the
      hearing. The judge heard from the appellant and his wife. The
      appellant denied any fraud and said he attended a one-day introductory
      session and took the test at Portsmouth International Colleges London
      test centre. He had paid a fee of ï¿½180. He said that in Pakistan he
      was a practising lawyer and had been taught through the medium of
      English and therefore had no need to cheat.

   8. The judge referred to the witness statements of Mr Peter Millington
      and Ms Rebecca Collings and at paragraph 15 said that their generic
      evidence carries little weight in isolation. The judge stated that the
      respondent had provided no evidence relating to the appellant
      individually. The judge found the appellant and his wife to be
      reliable witnesses and that the appellant gave his evidence in fluent
      English. The judge found his claim to be educated through English in
      Pakistan as inherently plausible. The judge stated they were aware
      that court proceedings in Pakistan are usually conducted in English.
      The judge then concluded the appellant speaks good English and this
      was the position before he came to the United Kingdom and so he had no
      need to cheat. The judge said the appellant had explained the
      circumstances of the test, such as where it was taken and the fee
      paid.

The Upper Tribunal

   9. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on the basis
      that there was no consideration by the judge as to whether or not the
      respondent had discharged the evidential and legal burden of proof
      applicable. Furthermore, there was no clear finding on the deception
      issue.

  10. Mr Duffy argued that the judge failed to assess the evidence correctly
      and did not identify the notion of  a  switching  burden.  Mr  Mahmood
      appeared for the appellant as he did in the First  tier  Tribunal.  He
      referred to paragraph 6 of the decision whereby the judge indicated it
      was necessary to be selective  when  referring  to  the  evidence.  He
      referred me to para 15 where the judge  said  there  was  no  evidence
      relating to the appellant individually. He submitted the appellant had
      no reason to cheat as he was proficient in English, having been taught
      through that language. He likened the situation to someone being asked
      to bring oranges from their garden. If they had oranges  growing  then
      there would be no need for them to go to the market to  buy  them.  He
      accepted the judge did not refer to the changing burden of  proof  but
      said this was so well settled that it was unnecessary.

Consideration

  11. It is unfortunate that  there  was  no  presenting  officer  attending
      before the judge. I have checked the  court  file  in  an  attempt  to
      determine what evidence the respondent placed before the judge in  the
      papers. I have located the bundle that  would  have  been  before  the
      judge as well as the  appellant's  bundle.  In  cases  such  as  these
      presenting officer's sometimes submit at hearing a report prepared  by
      the Home Office into a specific college giving statistics for instance
      about the number of tests on a specific day and the numbers cancelled.
      I do not see any such report in the papers.  Typically  there  can  be
      statements from experts about  the  calibration  of  the  testing  for
      personation to reduce false positives. I cannot see any such  evidence
      in the bundle before the judge.


  12. In the papers is a screen-print identifying the appellant and the test
      taken on 16 November 2011. The score recorded is 180 out of a possible
      200. The test was declared invalid. There is also a print  out  marked
      C1 which identifies the appellant by his passport number and  confirms
      that the outcome was used in two tier  4  applications.  Consequently,
      the judge is factually incorrect in stating at paragraph 15 that there
      has been no evidence produced specific to the appellant.

  13. At para 14 the judge stated in human  rights  appeals  the  burden  of
      proof is upon  the  appellant  to  show  an  interference  with  their
      protected human rights. If it is then it is for the respondent to show
      the interference is justified and the standard of proof is the balance
      of probabilities. In itself this is correct but  the  judge  makes  no
      reference to the jurisprudence which has developed in relation to  the
      large number of cases involving English language tests taken by proxy.


  14. SM and Qadir v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  (ETS  -
      Evidence - Burden  of  Proof)  [2016]  UKUT  00229  (IAC)  found   the
      Secretary of State's generic  evidence,  combined  with  her  evidence
      particular to the appellants, sufficed  to  discharge  the  evidential
      burden of proving that the TOEIC certificates  had  been  procured  by
      dishonesty. The respondent produced computerised  spreadsheet  entries
      derived from the "Look up Tool" .Para13 explains this further :

         On the face of the documents ETS devised a dichotomy  of  "invalid"
         and "questionable" TOEIC test results. The Home  Office,  in  turn,
         has developed a system whereby upon  receipt  of  the  ETS  testing
         analysis outcomes these are matched to the person who has the name,
         date of birth and nationality of the certificate  holder.  This  is
         known as the "Lookup Tool".

  15. This is repeated in the decision of R (on the application of Nawaz)  v
      Secretary  of   State   for   the   Home   Department   (ETS:   review
      standard/evidential basis) [2017] UKUT 00288 (IAC). There,  the  Upper
      Tribunal held that evidence obtained by use of the Look-up  Tool,  and
      subject to the human verification procedure, is an adequate basis  for
      the Secretary of State's deception finding  in  these  cases,  in  the
      light of Flynn & another [2008] EWCA Crim  970  [24  -  27],  and  the
      evidence of both Dr Harrison and Professor French.


  16. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hindson does not  set  out  the  distinction
      between the evidential and the legal burden in this type of  case  and
      makes no reference to the screen-print or the notion of a shifting the
      burden of proof.

  17. The judge does not give adequate reasons for the decision. It  is  not
      sufficient to assert at paragraph 16 that they found the appellant and
      his wife to be reliable witnesses. This conclusion must be explained.

  18. The fact the appellant could give his evidence in  fluent  English  is
      not the point. The appellant was giving his evidence before the  judge
      six years after the event.

  19. The appellant told the judge that he had been educated to  English  in
      Pakistan.  The  appellant's  bundle  does  not  indicate  he  provided
      confirmation of this fact albeit there is reference in the  papers  in
      the student visa application. At hearing, Mr  Mahmood  invited  me  to
      look at the appellant's qualifications from  Pakistan  to  demonstrate
      his ability in English. However he confirmed  this  evidence  was  not
      before the First-tier Tribunal and I declined  lest  it  prejudice  my
      approach to the error of law issue.

  20. Paragraph 18  is  the  closest  the  judge  comes  to  explaining  the
      decision. However, it is an assumption to state  the  appellant  would
      have no need to cheat. As was explained in MA (ETS  -  TOEIC  testing)
      [2016] UKUT 00450(IAC) a person competent in English may  still  cheat
      -para 57 :

         ...there is a range of reasons why persons  proficient  in  English
         may engage in TOEIC fraud. These include, inexhaustively,  lack  of
         confidence, fear of  failure,  lack  of  time  and  commitment  and
         contempt for the immigration system

  21. In the same way, the ability to describe  the  location  of  the  test
      centre and the fee paid may be of limited value. There are cases where
      the person has attended at the test centre and stood beside the  proxy
      test taker. In the circumstance such evidence is of limited  probative
      value though each case will turn on its facts.


  22. It is my conclusion that the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Hindson materially errs in law in failing to engage with the case  law
      and evidence in relation to the evidential and legal  burden.  Because
      of this the findings made in relation to article 8 is tainted.


   Decision.


   The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hindson materially errs in  law
   and is set aside. The appeal is to be relisted for a de novo  hearing  in
   the First-tier Tribunal on the issue of personation. The  respondent  has
   accepted that the appellant's marriage is genuine and subsisting and this
   is preserved unless there is evidence of subsequent change.

 Deputy Upper Tribunal

Directions.

   1. Realists for a de novo hearing in North Shields excluding First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Hindson.


   2. The respondent is to prepare a new appeal bundle which should index
      clearly the evidence specific to the appellant relied. The bundle
      should include the generic statements already provided plus any expert
      evidence. Any evidence specific to the college should be provided. If
      possible the sound recordings should be made available to the
      appellant's representative for their own analysis if they so wish. The
      appeal bundle should also contain the relevant case law.

   3. The appellant's representative should prepare a fresh appeal bundle
      including the evidence about the appellant's abilities in English
      before taking the test and evidence of taking the test.

   4. An interpreter is not required unless the appellant's representatives
      indicate to the contrary

   5. The hearing should not take longer than one and a half hours.
