                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellants are appealing against a decision  of  Judge  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal Young-Harry ("the  judge")  promulgated  on  14
         October 2019 dismissing their human  rights  claim.  Permission  to
         appeal was granted on 7 February 2020 on the basis that  the  judge
         had not assessed  the  best  interests  of  the  first  appellant's
         children.

      2. In the light of the covid-19 pandemic, directions  were  issued  by
         the Upper Tribunal expressing the preliminary view that  the  error
         of law issue in this appeal could be determined without a hearing.

      3. On 11 May 2020 Ms Isherwood, on behalf of respondent, wrote to  the
         Upper  Tribunal  stating  that  it  was  accepted  that  the  judge
         materially erred in law for the  reasons  given  in  the  grant  of
         permission. On 21 July 2020 she wrote again to the  Upper  Tribunal
         stating that the respondent accepts that the circumstances as  they
         now exist (where the first appellant's  husband  has  been  granted
         indefinite leave to remain and they have a British  citizen  child)
         establish that removal would be unlawful under section 6(1) of  the
         Human Rights Act.

      4. In the light of the position of (and for the reasons given by)  the
         respondent, I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and
         remake the decision by allowing the appeal.
