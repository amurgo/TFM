For the Appellant:     Dr Mynott, Jackson & Canter, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs K Heath, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Mouhamadou Falilou Ndao, was born on 2 February 1986 and
    is a male citizen of Senegal.  On 8 March 2013, a decision was taken to
    refuse the appellant's  claims  for  refugee  status  and  humanitarian
    protection and to  remove  him  to  Senegal.   The  appellant  appealed
    against  the  removal  decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal   (Judge
    Frankish) which, in a  determination  promulgated  on  29  April  2013,
    dismissed the appeal.  The appellant appealed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    and, by a determination promulgated on  6  August  2013,  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal  Judge  Rimington  set   aside   the   First-tier   Tribunal's
    determination and directed a resumed hearing.  At that hearing at Stoke-
    on-Trent on 15 October 2013, Dr Mynott appeared for the  appellant  and
    Mrs Heath appeared for the respondent.

 2. Judge Rimington directed that the decision should proceed to be  remade
    on Article 8 ECHR grounds only; the asylum/Article 3 ECHR  findings  of
    the First-tier Tribunal were preserved.

 3. In his determination at [18], Judge Frankish recorded:

         The respondent concedes that 'the documents you have provided  have
         confirmed that your father is a high-ranking  military  officer  in
         Senegal.  (18); the appellant has a legitimate diplomatic  passport
         (17); there are attacks on the barracks  where  the  appellant  was
         growing up (19); there was also an attack on the appellant's school
         (20).  In short, notwithstanding any objection to  the  conduct  of
         the interview, there were no serious objections to the  appellant's
         credibility.  The objection is to whether he is actually at risk.

 4. Although those concessions by the respondent  concern  the  appellant's
    asylum claim, they do have a bearing  on  the  relevant  facts  of  the
    Article 8 ECHR appeal.  At [23], Judge Frankish recorded:

         Finally, it was the appellant's own case that his father himself is
         not a reliable witness.  He had told the appellant so many  stories
         about his own background, from being born in Belgium or  not  being
         born in Belgium to being brought up by  his  grandmother  which  he
         does not remember to the mother abandoning him to his mother  going
         off to marry someone else, the appellant  does  not  know  what  to
         believe.

 5. The appellant acknowledges that he came to  the  United  Kingdom  on  a
    visit visa but it is his case that he always believed  that  he  had  a
    valid Belgian passport and,  after  his  visit  visa  had  expired,  he
    thought he was entitled to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  exercising
    Treaty rights as an EU citizen.  At [23], Judge Frankish found,

         In short, the appellant's asylum claim is entirely tendentious  and
         lacks any credible basis.  It is not helped by  the  fact  that  no
         claim was made for three years until the appellant was caught using
         a false passport to cash in a cheque issued to him  by,  incredibly
         enough, the Inland Revenue.

 6. Whether the standard of proof in the Article 8 ECHR appeal is a balance
    of probabilities or that of reasonable  likelihood  (see  EM  (Lebanon)
    [2008] UKHL 64) I find that this appellant  has  failed,  even  on  the
    lower standard, to satisfy me that he has  told  the  truth  about  his
    relationship with his father and his knowledge of his true  nationality
    and immigration status.  I do not intend to go behind the  respondent's
    concession that the appellant had a diplomatic passport  and  that  his
    father may have been  a  high  ranking  military  officer  in  Senegal.
    However, the appellant has  brought  an  entirely  false  asylum  claim
    before the First-tier Tribunal and has not sought to appeal against the
    dismissal of the appeal on asylum grounds.  I do not  accept  that  the
    appellant, who presented to the Tribunal as an  intelligent  reasonably
    educated young man, did not know that he was in possession of  a  false
    Belgian passport and I do not accept that he believed that  he  had  no
    reason to present himself to the authorities on the expiry of his visit
    visa; that claim makes no sense whatsoever  given  that,  when  he  was
    arrested, he did not seek to assert  his  right  to  remain  as  an  EU
    citizen but rather claimed asylum.  I do not accept that the  appellant
    does not have any proper memory of his own childhood and his attempt to
    blame his predicament on his father is not credible.  I note  that  the
    appellant had also lied to the respondent by telling her officers  that
    his father's  friend  had  given  him  the  Belgian  passport  whereas,
    according to the appellant,  his  father  himself  had  given  him  the
    document.  An incontrovertible  fact,  however,  is  that  the  Belgian
    passport was a false document.  Whether or not the  appellant's  father
    knew that it was a false document is immaterial; having considered  all
    the evidence and  the  various  explanations  and  alterations  to  the
    account provided by the appellant, I am satisfied that he knew that the
    document was a false passport and that consequently he had no right  to
    remain in the United Kingdom when his visit visa expired.

 7. The respondent accepts that the appellant is  in  a  relationship  with
    Lauren McNamara.  I accept that the relationship may have started in or
    around July 2011.  The appellant lives with Miss McNamara in  the  home
    she shares with her mother and he has done so since April 2012.  I have
    no reason to disbelieve Miss McNamara when, in her evidence, she states
    that she suffered a miscarriage in October  2012.   I  note  also  that
    there is some (very limited) medical evidence to indicate Miss McNamara
    suffered from depression  and  anxiety  which  led  her  to  leave  her
    employment and to  receive  disability  benefits.   Miss  McNamara  now
    claims that she is able to function much better with the support of the
    appellant.  They are engaged.

 8. I heard evidence from Miss McNamara and from her mother.  I found  both
    these witnesses to be generally credible but  I  find  they  have  both
    sought to exaggerate Miss McNamara's current mental health problems.  I
    say that for the following reasons.  There is a letter from a Dr  Bosah
    dated 13 July 2013 which reads:

         I write to confirm that Lauren McNamara had a  history  of  anxiety
         and depression and she  is  under  continuous  monitoring  at  this
         surgery.  Any co-operation  extended  to  Lauren  would  be  highly
         appreciated.

 9. Miss McNamara's mother, Karen, asserted in her witness statement  that,
    "Lauren still only leaves the house alone for  scheduled  appointments.
    She does not cope with change and unfamiliar situations."   [8].   Miss
    McNamara herself told me that she was now back  in  employment  working
    for Bibby Line Group.  She is employed in an apprenticeship scheme  and
    has a monthly net wage of approximately ï¿½700.  She has been working  in
    different departments and is currently working in the  credit  control.
    I find  that  Miss  McNamara's  current  employment  status  sits  very
    uneasily with evidence to the effect that she capable  of  leaving  the
    house only "for scheduled appointments."  She  is  working  for  a  new
    employer and appears to have had  little  difficulty  in  adjusting  to
    working for different departments of the company.  I accept  that  Miss
    McNamara may have suffered from depression in the  past  but  there  is
    nothing in  the  current  medical  evidence  or  the  evidence  of  her
    employment which would indicate that her mental health is  in  any  way
    precarious at the present time.  Having said that,  I  accept  that  it
    would not  be  reasonable  to  expect  Miss  McNamara  to  go  to  live
    permanently in Senegal with the appellant.

10. To summarise my findings, I find that the appellant  is  an  untruthful
    witness who was aware that he should not remain in the  United  Kingdom
    following the expiry of a visit visa issued on his diplomatic  passport
    and who sought to remain knowing that a Belgian passport which  he  had
    in his possession was not valid.  I find it likely that he would  never
    have made himself known to the United Kingdom authorities  had  he  not
    been arrested on suspicion of fraud.  Thereafter he has done little  to
    improve his immigration history by bringing an  entirely  false  asylum
    claim.  I accept that Miss McNamara  probably  did  not  know  anything
    about the appellant's immigration  status  until  he  was  arrested  in
    February 2013.  The fact remains, however, that the appellant did  know
    that he entered the relationship with Miss McNamara without making  any
    attempt to inform her of his  lack  of  immigration  status.   To  that
    extent, his relationship with her has been based on a  lie.   I  accept
    that they are in a relationship and that the appellant lives with  Miss
    McNamara at her mother's home.  I accept also  that  Miss  McNamara  is
    devoted to the appellant and no doubt hopes and expects to enjoy a life
    together with him.  However, my assessment of the evidence leads me  to
    conclude that the appellant himself may not  be  so  committed  to  the
    relationship.  He has entered the relationship  withholding  the  truth
    about his immigration status from Miss McNamara but  I  am  aware  also
    that when he was  interviewed  by  the  respondent's  officers  he  was
    ignorant of the name of her father and the college  at  which  she  was
    studying at  that  time  (see  refusal  letter,  paragraph  30).  This,
    together with the other evidence, indicates a lack of commitment to the
    relationship on his part.

11. The appellant relies on the House of Lords decision of  Chikwamba  2008
    UKHL 40   Chikwamba is an authority which is often misinterpreted.   It
    is authority for the proposition that, if an out of country application
    for entry clearance is likely to succeed, then a decision to  force  an
    appellant to leave the United Kingdom to make such  an  application  is
    all the more likely to be disproportionate.  It is not authority for  a
    proposition that an appellant (such as the present  appellant)  who  is
    very unlikely to be able to meet the Immigration Rules must, therefore,
    be allowed to remain with Article 8 ECHR leave.  I am aware that it may
    be appropriate in certain cases for  an  appellant  to  remain  in  the
    United  Kingdom  even  where  there  are  no  children  or  where   the
    appellant's relationship with the United Kingdom citizen  has  not  yet
    been formalised by marriage.  However, in  the  light  of  my  findings
    regarding the appellant's immigration history and his part, as  I  find
    it, in his relationship with Miss McNamara,  I  find  that  the  public
    interest concerned with the removal  of  the  appellant  outweighs  the
    family life interests of the appellant  and  Miss  McNamara.   I  fully
    accept that Miss McNamara would be upset if the  appellant  leaves  the
    United Kingdom, but I do not  accept  the  assertions,  unsupported  by
    medical evidence, that his departure will precipitate a serious decline
    in her mental health.

DECISION

12. This appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).
