                                                                  Respondent

For the Respondent:    Ms M Malhotra, Counsel instructed by S Satha & Co


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and the Respondent as the Claimant.   The Claimant, a national of
    Sri Lanka, date  of  birth  15  February  1983,  appealed  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision dated 1 April 2014 to refuse to  issue  a
    residence card with  reference  to  Regulation  6  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  As expressed in the  Notice
    of Immigration Decision it indicated the application had been made  but
    had failed because the EEA family member, Miss  Danson  had  failed  to
    provide evidence that she was a qualified person for  the  purposes  of
    Regulation 6 of the 2006 Regulations.

2.   The matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Widdup who on  19  May
    2015 allowed the appeal having assessed  all  the  evidence  and  being
    fully satisfied that Mrs Danson,  the  Sponsor  was  exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom, was a qualified  person  and  that  there
    were no other elements of the requirements which needed to be met.

3.   Permission to appeal was given to the Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department by FtTJ C Andrew on 15 July 2015.

4.   Those findings of fact appeared to me to be wholly unobjectionable  and
    the grounds of application  do  not  assert  that  there  is  something
    irrational or unreasoned or unacceptable about the judge's findings  of
    fact.  Rather it is said the judge erred in that he  had  purported  to
    exercise the discretion under Regulation 17(4) of the 2006  Regulations
    which it was not open to him to do.

5.   The SSHD raised the issue  of  the  case  of  Ihemedu  (OFM's  meaning)
    Nigeria [2011] UKUT 340 (IAC) to which might well be added the case  of
    Ukus [2012] UKUT 307 which again  identified  that  where  there  is  a
    residual discretion to be exercised by the Secretary of State it is for
    the Secretary of State to do so and  not  for  a  First-tier  Judge  to
    undertake that exercise.

6.   Accordingly on that sole and narrow issue the judge erred  in  law  and
    accordingly the Original Tribunal decision cannot stand.

7.   The appeal by the Secretary of State is allowed to the extent that  the
    matter is returned to the Secretary of State to await her  decision  on
    the exercise of discretion under the 2006 Regulations.

ANONYMITY

8.   No anonymity order is required or appropriate.
