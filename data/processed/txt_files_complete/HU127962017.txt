Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B Malik (Counsel) instructed by Immigration Legal
Services
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 10 December  1973.   He
    arrived in the United Kingdom as a  visitor  on  10  August  2009.   He
    thereafter overstayed and on 15  October  2013  applied  for  leave  to
    remain on the basis of his private and family life, which was  granted.
    This leave was subsequently cancelled but then reinstated.  On  10  May
    2016, the day prior to the  expiry  of  leave,  the  Appellant  made  a
    further application for leave to remain on the basis of his family  and
    private life in the UK.  This application was  refused  in  a  decision
    dated 4 October 2017 on the basis that it was found that the  Appellant
    did not meet the suitability requirements under S-LTR of Appendix FM on
    the following basis:

         "ETS has a record of your TOEIC speaking test taken on 28  November
         2012 at the Universal Training centre.  ETS undertook  a  check  of
         your test and confirmed to the  SSHD  that  there  was  significant
         evidence  to  conclude  that  your  certificate  was   fraudulently
         obtained by the use of a proxy test taker.  Your  scores  from  the
         test taken on 28 November 2012 at  the  Universal  Training  Centre
         have now been cancelled by ETS.  On the basis  of  the  information
         provided to her by ETS, the SSHD is satisfied that your certificate
         was fraudulently obtained  and  you  showed  an  intention  to  use
         deception.

         Furthermore on 7 September 2014 you underwent a returning leave  to
         enter interview.  During the interview you admitted that  you  paid
         someone to sit with you during  your  English  test  at  this  test
         centre and that they answered at least half  of  the  questions  on
         your behalf.  Furthermore  you  admitted  to  paying  �270/280  for
         someone to answer the questions for you."

 2. The Appellant appealed against this decision and his appeal was  listed
    for  hearing  on  10  May  2018.   On  8  May  2018   the   Appellant's
    representatives, Immigration Legal  Services,  wrote  to  the  Tribunal
    requesting  that  the  appeal  be  adjourned  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant's wife wished to attend in order to give  evidence.   However
    the Appellant's four children  were  at  that  time  subject  to  child
    protection plans  with  the  local  authority  under  the  category  of
    emotional abuse and the local authority had refused permission for  the
    children and the Appellant's wife to attend the hearing  by  travelling
    there together.  The local authority offered day care for the  children
    with a foster carer on the  day  of  the  hearing  in  order  that  the
    Appellant's wife might attend the  hearing.   However  the  Appellant's
    wife instructed that her children would not  stay  with  strangers  and
    someone who does not know them and thus she was  in  a  very  difficult
    position.

 3. A letter from Elaine Hughes, team manager of Family  Safeguarding  Team
    South, dated 3 May 2018 was attached which  provides,  inter  alia,  as
    follows:

         "The Local Authority felt  that  it  is  not  appropriate  for  the
         children to be taken out of school for the day and to  travel  with
         both parents in the car together as this places  them  at  risk  of
         harm.  The Local Authority offered day care with  a  foster  carer,
         however Ms B made the decision not to attend Court as she  did  not
         want her children  going  to  strangers  and  the  Local  Authority
         support this decision."

 4. The application for an adjournment was refused in a  decision  dated  9
    May 2018. It was refused by a Tribunal caseworker, on  the  basis  that
    the application did not establish what other alternatives for childcare
    Ms B had considered or explored or whether the costs of any alternative
    childcare arrangements was prohibitive.  It was found:

         "Although it was for Ms B to decide, reasonable attempts were  made
         by the local authority to allow her to attend  the  hearing,  which
         she has refused.  There is no guarantee  that  the  situation  will
         have resolved itself after the meeting (that is a reference to  the
         meeting with  social  services  as  to  the  Appellant's  continued
         exclusion from the family home)  in  June  or  whether  within  any
         reasonable timeframe  thereafter.   The  appeal  has  already  been
         ongoing for almost seven months.

         The application can  be  renewed  if  further  information  can  be
         provided to support it."

 5. The Appellant's representatives, it would appear  on  receipt  of  this
    decision, then wrote to the Tribunal on 9 May in the following terms:

         "Our  client  instructs  that  he  would  like  his  appeal  to  be
         considered on paper and will not be attending the hearing tomorrow.
          We are in the process of drafting written submissions and will  be
         posting these today via special next day delivery."

 6. The appeal then came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Robertson  on  10
    May 2018 with no attendance by or on behalf of the Appellant.   However
    the Respondent was represented by a Presenting Officer, Miss Simbi.  At
    [5] the judge held as follows:

         "The Appellant did  not  attend  the  hearing.  Although  initially
         requesting an oral hearing he notified HMCTS through his solicitors
         that he wished his appeal to  be  decided  on  the  papers.   I  am
         satisfied that there is sufficient evidence before me  to  reach  a
         fair and just decision."

 7. The Presenting Officer at the hearing provided a copy of the summary of
    the interview notes that  took  place  between  the  Appellant  and  an
    Immigration Officer on his return from Pakistan on  7  September  2014.
    This is recorded by the  judge  at  [11]  which  provides  as  follows,
    recorded at 20:27 with the use of an Urdu interpreter:

         "The passenger stated he had submitted an English test  certificate
         as  part  of  the  documents  required  for  his  most  recent  LTR
         application as a spouse.

         He stated that he could not remember the date of the test or  where
         he took the test but that he knew he had taken one.

         From memory he  thought  that  the  test  was  several  years  ago,
         possible 2012 and that it took place at a  College  about  30  mins
         outside of Luton but he did not know the name.

         When I put to him that we had information that he did not take  the
         test, he admitted that he had  attended  a  test  centre  but  that
         somebody had helped him.

         He stated that an Indian male who was the examiner had helped  him,
         completing about half of the questions for him and that he had paid
         him about �270/280 to do this.  He did not know his name.

         He stated that he realised what he had done was wrong but  that  he
         had done it in order to be able to stay in the UK with his family."

 8. The judge went on to find that he was satisfied on  the  evidence  that
    the Appellant had fraudulently obtained his English  test  certificate,
    that  his  statements  to  the  Immigration  Officer  were  clear   and
    unambiguous and that consequently he was unable to meet the suitability
    criteria S-LTR.4.2 of Appendix FM of the Rules.

 9. The judge then went on to consider the appeal outside the Rules  noting
    that the Appellant and his wife have four children,  all  of  whom  are
    British citizens, but finding that removal of the Appellant  would  not
    be disproportionate.

10. Whilst the Appellant did not attend the  hearing,  written  submissions
    were made on his behalf by his solicitors and there was also  a  bundle
    of evidence including a witness statement from the Appellant  where  he
    states at [4]:

         "4.  I did not cheat or use any fraud in the English test.   I  did
             the test myself and did not cheat.  The  test  was  done  with
             headphones on and on a computer.  I did the test myself.  This
             issue was not brought up when I got my last leave  to  remain.
             I am settled now and have a family life  with  children.   The
             Home Office allegation is wrong.

         5.   The Home Office are  putting  false  allegations  on  me.   In
             September 2014 I was coming back from a very upsetting trip to
             Pakistan.  My father passed away and I went for his funeral in
             Pakistan.  The weather was very bad in  Pakistan  and  it  was
             raining heavy with floods.  It took me a  few  days  to  reach
             from Kashmir to get to the airport in Islamabad because of the
             bad weather.  I missed my flight and paid about �270  to  �280
             to re book another flight to come back to the UK.  I was  also
             stressed to get back to the UK as my wife U was pregnant then.
              Having traveled for a continuous few days  after  my  fathers
             funeral, I was absolutely tired, stressed and exhausted.  I do
             remember a little of the interview at the airport but I  would
             not have said that I paid someone to do test as  this  is  not
             true.  I actually remember I told the officer that  I  had  to
             pay for another flight and that this cost about �270 - �280 as
             I missed my first flight due to bad weather.  I  did  not  say
             that I paid someone to do  a  test.   I  was  very  tired  and
             exhausted they should not be interviewing me in that state  as
             I just came back after my fathers death."

11. The decision and reasons dismissing the appeal were  promulgated  on  2
    July 2018.  Permission to appeal was sought on the basis that the judge
    had erred in failing to consider certain facts of the case, failing  to
    consider  the   evidence,   failing   to   consider   the   exceptional
    circumstances of the case and Article 8 and  failing  to  consider  the
    law, the Home Office policy documents and the case  law.   The  grounds
    are rather loosely drafted but notably raised the point that the  judge
    has made reference to interview notes passed to him by the  Respondent,
    however, this evidence had not been served  on  the  Appellant  or  his
    representatives as it had been served at the hearing and that the judge
    had failed to make a proper assessment  of  Article  8,  in  particular
    Section 117B(6) and the best interests of the children.

12. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Simpson
    in a decision dated 20 August 2018 in the following terms:

         "Permission to appeal is granted because:

         (i)  there was disclosed  arguable  error  concerning  the  Judge's
             admission of evidence from the respondent on the  day  of  the
             hearing of which in the light of the appellant's election  for
             a determination on the papers and thereby being absent on  the
             day, there did  not  appear  to  have  been  raised  with  the
             respondent, as a matter of fairness, whether the said evidence
             had been served on the appellant's representatives in due time
             or at all, of which evidence the appellant's  papers  did  not
             disclose there having been prior sight by the appellant and/or
             his  representatives,  and  the  Judge  having  treated   that
             evidence as materially contributory to the conclusion that the
             appellant  had  used  fraud  to  obtain  an   English-language
             certificate (paras 10-14);

         (ii) judicial assessment of Art 8  proportionality  arguably  erred
             with respect to S.55 best interests of the  child  with  inter
             alia  the  exercise  of   arguably   unsupported   assumptions
             concerning, firstly, the 'resilience' of  children,  all  four
             children herein British with a British  mother,  the  children
             aged between 7 and 3 having already  faced  a  crisis  in  the
             family, and secondly, that close family ties can be reasonably
             maintained 'via  modern  means  of  communication  and  visit'
             (paras 16vi, 21);

         (iii)    equally the proportionality assessment arguably erred with
             respect to a  lack  of  incisive  assessment  of  a  mandatory
             statutory consideration, S.117B(6);

         (iv) there  appeared  arguably  overall  an  inadequacy  of  Art  8
             proportionality reasoning.  All grounds arguable."

    Hearing

13. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, the Appellant  attended  with
    his wife and was represented by Mr Billal Malik, who sought to rely  on
    a skeleton argument which explored two of the  issues  raised  in  more
    detail.  The first of these was the issue of procedural unfairness with
    reference to Rule 25 of the First-tier Tribunal  Procedure  Rules.   It
    was asserted that the Appellant had elected a paper hearing under  Rule
    25(1)(a)  and  it  was  plainly  unfair  to  permit  the  Home   Office
    representative to participate in the  hearing,  and  in  particular  to
    admit further materials, i.e. the interview  summary  notes,  that  the
    Appellant had never seen before and had not had the chance  to  respond
    to.  It was submitted that these documents were clearly material to the
    judge's assessment and the only fair course  of  procedure  would  have
    been to adjourn the appeal.  Secondly, that  the  judge  had  erred  in
    respect of his consideration of Article 8  outside  the  Rules  and  in
    particular Section 117B(6), and the  judge  had  failed  to  apply  the
    correct law, i.e. MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ  705  at  [46]  and  in
    particular at [49] per Lord Justice Elias:

         "The fact that the child has been in the UK for seven  years  would
         need to be given significant weight in the proportionality exercise
         for two  related  reasons:  first,  because  of  its  relevance  to
         determining the nature and strength of the child's best  interests;
         and second, because it establishes as a starting point  that  leave
         should  be  granted  unless  there  are  powerful  reasons  to  the
         contrary."

14. Reference was also made to the decision in  MT  and  ET  (Child's  best
    interests; ex tempore pilot) Nigeria [2018] UKUT 00088 (IAC) at [26] to
    [34] and it was submitted the judge had made baseless findings that the
    children were resilient and that the links between  the  Appellant  and
    his children could be maintained by modern methods of communication.

15. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, the procedural history of the
    appeal was explored and documents obtained from the Upper Tribunal file
    and copied for the  parties  as  to  the  history  of  the  adjournment
    requests and a copy of the interview summary notes.

16. Mr Malik made detailed submissions in line with his skeleton  argument,
    submitting that the judge's decision was procedurally  unfair  and  was
    thus  fundamentally  flawed  and  that  the  judge  had  further  erred
    materially in law in his Article 8 proportionality assessment.

17. In his submissions, Mr Tufan submitted that it appears at the  eleventh
    hour the Appellant wanted his case considered  on  the  paper  evidence
    available  and  made  written  submissions.   He  submitted  that   the
    Appellant had been put on notice of the fact  that  the  Appellant  had
    been interviewed on return from Pakistan and this was clearly  set  out
    at [3] of the refusal decision (see above).  Given  the  Appellant  was
    put on notice of the allegation, he could have sought  disclosure,  but
    in any event Mr Tufan  submitted  that  it  would  not  have  made  any
    material difference to the  outcome,  the  Appellant's  response  being
    contained at [5] of his witness statement which he  submitted  did  not
    take the matter much further.  It was clear the Appellant had  made  an
    admission and was now denying it.

18.  Mr  Tufan  submitted  that  the  evidential  burden  remained  on  the
    Appellant, even  on  the  generic  evidence,  to  provide  an  innocent
    explanation as to how his TOEIC  test  result  had  been  found  to  be
    invalid.  Given that the Appellant did not turn up to make his case  at
    the hearing he failed to provide an innocent explanation and  thus  the
    judge was justified in upholding  the  Respondent's  decision  in  that
    respect.

19. Lastly in relation to proportionality  and  Section  117B(6)  Mr  Tufan
    submitted that the decision in MA (Pakistan) is quite  clear  that  the
    immigration  history  and  conduct  of  a  parent  can  be  taken  into
    consideration.  It is further clear from Lord Justice Elias's  judgment
    in AM (Pakistan) that a blatant disregard for  immigration  control  is
    sufficient to make it reasonable  for  children  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.  In this particular  case  it  was  a  matter  for  them:  the
    children were not required to leave the UK as they  could  remain  with
    their mother who is British and so they were not obliged to leave.   Mr
    Tufan further noted the serious allegations made against the  Appellant
    by his wife which are set out at [5] of her witness statement  dated  3
    May 2018. Mr Tufan also noted that the social services had  not  deemed
    it in the best interests of the children to travel to court with  their
    parents.

20. In reply, Mr Malik submitted that he accepted  that  AM  (Pakistan)  is
    authority for the proposition that an Appellant's  immigration  history
    can be looked at in the assessment of the  reasonableness  of  removal.
    However one must take into account the  judgment  in  MT  and  ET.   He
    submitted that the evidence before the judge was that this was a family
    in transition with an aspiration to be reunited.  He reminded the Upper
    Tribunal that the judge did not find that the Appellant, his  wife  and
    children and his wife's daughter from the former marriage  were  not  a
    family unit, even  taking  into  account  the  intervention  by  social
    services.  He submitted that to  maintain  family  unity  the  children
    would be obliged to follow their father back to  Pakistan  and  it  was
    necessary to apply the judgment in MA (Pakistan) as to whether  or  not
    this was justifiable.

21. I reserved my decision which I now give with my reasons.

    Findings

22. I find material errors  of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  for  the  following  reasons.   Firstly,  whilst   the
    Appellant had very late in the day elected to have his appeal heard  on
    the papers, for reasons which are unclear as there  appears  to  be  no
    prohibition on his attendance at the Tribunal, I find the  judge  erred
    in taking account of additional evidence from  the  Respondent  in  the
    absence of the Appellant or a representative on his behalf and  without
    such evidence having been served on the Appellant.  Whilst  it  is  the
    case that the allegation that the Appellant admitted  in  interview  on
    return from Pakistan on 7 September 2014 that he had paid  somebody  to
    assist him in  his  English  language  test,  that  assertion  was  not
    evidenced or corroborated.  The notes submitted by Miss  Simbi  at  the
    appeal hearing are somewhat fuller than the version  contained  in  the
    refusal letter and I find it was procedurally unfair for the  judge  to
    have continued with the appeal and made findings  without  the  matters
    being put to the Appellant and without the opportunity of  hearing  the
    Appellant give oral  evidence  on  the  issue.   I  make  this  finding
    somewhat reluctantly given that the Appellant chose not to  attend  the
    hearing and give the judge the opportunity to assess  his  evidence  on
    this key issue in light  of  the  established  jurisprudence  on  TOEIC
    cases.  However as a matter of principle it is not  appropriate  for  a
    judge to proceed in the absence of a party where new evidence has  been
    served which has a material bearing on the credibility of the Appellant
    and the outcome of the appeal.

23. In relation to the second ground I further find that  the  judge  erred
    materially in law in his  assessment  of  the  proportionality  of  the
    removal of the Appellant considered outside the Immigration  Rules,  in
    that nowhere in his decision  is  there  a  clear  and  fully  reasoned
    assessment of the children's best interests nor is the test set out  in
    MA (Pakistan) (op. cit.) applied.  The judge assumed that the  children
    would remain in the UK with their mother,  all  of  whom  are  British,
    without grappling with the issue of whether that will be reasonable  in
    all the circumstances, in that if they wished family life  to  continue
    that would invariably mean that the children would have to leave the UK
    and whether there were very strong reasons to  justify  that  decision.
    There is also no consideration of Section 117B(6) apart from the merest
    passing reference at [20] and whether it would be reasonable to  expect
    the children to leave.  Therefore given that this appeal will impact on
    the lives of four British children I find  a  material  error  in  this
    aspect of the decision and reasons as well.



Notice of Decision

24.  I find material errors of law in the decision of  First  tier  Tribunal
Judge Robertson. I     set that decision aside and remit the  appeal  for  a
hearing de novo before the First-tier   Tribunal.   However,  the  Appellant
and his wife are on notice that if they do  not    attend  that  hearing  in
order to give oral evidence that the appeal is likely  to  be     determined
summarily in light of the history.
