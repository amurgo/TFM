Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr M Ume-Ezeoke, counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenny, Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Ghana, born on 11 September  1969.  His
      appeal before the First-tier Tribunal  against  the  decision  of  the
      respondent dated 26 January 2014 refusing to  issue  him  a  residence
      card pursuant to the 2006 Immigration (EEA) Regulations  -  'the  2006
      Regulations' - was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Hutchinson
      in a determination promulgated on 1 July 2014. The Judge found that he
      had not shown that his marriage was validly  contracted  according  to
      French law.


   2.  However,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not   consider   the
      alternative claim, namely, that he was in a durable relationship  with
      his EEA National sponsor pursuant to Regulation 8 of  the  Immigration
      (EEA) Regulations 2006.


   3. On 20 August 2014 Judge Gillespie granted the appellant's  application
      for permission to appeal on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal had
      not addressed his appeal pursuant to Regulation 8.


   4. The respondent's Rule 24 response noted that there was  no  opposition
      to  the  application  for  permission  to  appeal.  The  Tribunal  was
      "......invited to determine the appeal with a fresh oral (continuance)
      hearing  to  consider  whether  the  appellant   is   in   a   durable
      relationship."


   5. The matter was accordingly set down for a hearing on 2  October  2014.
      On  that  date,  there  was  no  attendance  by  the  appellant  or  a
      representative. However, I was not satisfied that the directions which
      were supposed to accompany the notice of  hearing  had  in  fact  been
      given; they were not attached to the notice of hearing in the Tribunal
      bundle. I considered that it would be appropriate and just  to  afford
      the appellant an opportunity to present his appeal.


   6. In the circumstances, the notice  of  hearing  was  re-served  on  the
      appellant and on the 18 December he  attended  the  hearing  with  his
      legal representative.


     Hearing on 18 December 2014


   7. I have had regard to  the  bundles  presented  by  the  appellant  and
      respondent.


   8. The appellant, Mr Kwame Owusu attended the hearing and gave  evidence.
      He adopted his witness statement which he  signed  and  dated  at  the
      hearing. It appears to be the same witness statement that he  produced
      before the First-tier Tribunal, and which is dated 14 April 2014.


   9. He was born on 11 September 1969 at Accra, Ghana. He has lived in  the
      UK for 12 years. He married his wife,  Ms  Tania  Sylvie  Alphonse,  a
      French national, who is residing and exercising Treaty rights  in  the
      UK. He asserted that  they  married  on  25  June  2013  according  to
      Ghanaian customary marriage laws.


  10. He also contends that he has a  subsisting  and  durable  relationship
      with his wife which has lasted for about two years. His wife  and  his
      entire family are aware of his  appeal  and  are  in  support  of  his
      application. He therefore 'requests' that he be  granted  a  residence
      card.


  11. In his oral evidence, he said that  his  wife  has  not  attended  the
      hearing . She is not at work. She is not feeling well. He claimed that
      she is two months pregnant. She is also "afraid of coming  to  court."
      The pregnancy has, he claimed, been  confirmed  by  his  GP.  However,
      apart from his assertion, no evidence has been produced  that  she  is
      pregnant.


  12. He said that she suffered a miscarriage two years ago, namely,  in  or
      about October  2012.  She  was  four  months  pregnant  prior  to  the
      miscarriage.


  13. Mr Ume-Ezeoke asked him why no utility bills and  the  like  had  been
      produced for the hearing showing that they have been living  together.
      He said they rented a room. They do not have their names on any of the
      bills. They moved into that accommodation in February 2013, i.e.,  one
      and a half years ago. The relationship is still subsisting.


  14. In cross examination, he was asked when  their  relationship  started.
      They started seeing each other since 2010. They decided to get married
      in 2013.


  15. He was asked why then he stated at paragraph 11 of his statement  that
      his relationship has lasted for about two years. He  said  they  lived
      together  for  a  time,  and  "along   the   way   there   have   been
      misunderstandings." They have known each other for four  years.  After
      two years, they have lived together.


  16. He said they pay money to the "sub-lessor", Mr Yawu Usa. The amount of
      �80 a week is paid by his wife. She  gives  him  cash.  This  is  'all
      inclusive'.  His wife has a bank account. Those documents are  however
      not part of the bundle of evidence.


  17. Both he and his partner have mobile phones. They are pay  as  you  go.
      His wife has bank statements which are sent to the address. She has an
      account with Barclays.


  18. Before living at their current address,  they  stayed  in  Catford  in
      2011. They lived together until moving to Dagenham.


  19. He said that they have separated on five or six occasions  during  the
      course of the relationship. They sometimes separated for two or  three
      months and sometimes for two weeks. The last time they  separated  was
      about two years ago. Since  2011  they  have  lived  together  without
      separation. They did not separate after the earlier miscarriage.


  20. They got married as they had been together for a while. It was decided
      that if they wanted to get into the relationship and be  committed  to
      each other they should get married.


  21. He was asked how the Tribunal can be sure that they are in  a  durable
      relationship having regard to the history of separations. He said they
      are committed to each other now. This is because the baby is due.


  22. Since she became pregnant she has been to hospital. She has a midwife.
      He said that she went to a GP. He said shortly thereafter that he does
      not think it was the hospital.


  23. He did not go to any of these appointments with her. This  is  because
      she attends the GP either on the way to, or on  returning  from  work.
      The GP is close to where they live. He does not know the name  of  the
      GP practice or the name of her doctor.


  24. He was referred to paragraph 4 of his partner's  statement  where  she
      stated that she is employed with London Cleaning and Support Services.
      She also referred to her wage slips attached to the bundle. I have had
      regard to documentation before the First-tier Tribunal. There are  two
      such wage slips for September and October 2013. However, they  do  not
      identify her address.


  25. Although the appellant stated that there were no documents relating to
      utilities that were presented to the Tribunal, I have  had  regard  to
      pages 14 and 15 of the First-tier Tribunal bundle (not referred to  by
      the appellant or his counsel) showing three British Gas bills in joint
      names containing the address at Dagenham; they are dated  28  February
      2012, 30 May 2012 and 30 June 2013.  However,  there  are  no  further
      utility documents of that nature or any other document that  has  been
      produced as part of the First-tier Tribunal bundle.


  26. Mr Owusu confirmed that no updating wage slips have been produced.  Ms
      Alphonse is said to be employed as a maintenance assistance. She  does
      36 hours a week, working in the Enfield area. She  earns  about  �6.20
      per hour. This is paid into her bank  electronically.   He  is  "fully
      supported by my wife."


  27. He spends his days reading. He and his partner go to the park or  stay
      at home, or visit friends.  Neither of them has any family in the  UK.
      He has met her sisters, who live in France, and they visited in  2013.
      Her brother came here in 2014.


  28. He was referred to paragraph 12 of  his  witness  statement  where  he
      claimed that his wife and the entire family are aware  of  his  appeal
      and support it. This, he said, referred to his wife's relatives.


  29. He has read the reasons for refusal letter.  Ms Kenny took him to page
      8 of the reasons for refusal dated 26  January  2014.  The  respondent
      stated that they had failed to  provide  any  evidence  of  a  durable
      relationship. She drew his attention to the relevant paragraph in  the
      reasons for refusal letter at page 8 where it is stated that  evidence
      of cohabitation and joint responsibility of assets are to be expected.
      The  list  of  expected  evidence  is  detailed.  This  includes  bank
      statements, utility bills in joint names, evidence of  joint  finances
      or joint business ventures. This may include tax returns  or  business
      contacts.


  30. Ms Kenny read the out the evidence requirements at page 8 and drew his
      attention to the fact that the respondent had contended  that  he  had
      provided insufficient evidence demonstrating that he is in  a  durable
      relationship. The application had accordingly refused  on  that  basis
      under Regulation 8(5) of the 2006 Regulations.


  31. Having read out that paragraph to the appellant  Ms  Kenny  asked  him
      why, when he decided to  appeal  against  the  decision,  he  did  not
      provide examples of the evidence expected as identified in the letter.
      He said that he did not have it at the time. He said the  Home  Office
      did not make him aware as to what was required. He understood that  no
      further evidence would be produced.


  32. Mr Ume-Ezeoke confirmed to the Tribunal that he was  only  relying  on
      the appellant's and his partner's  witness  statements.  There  is  no
      further  documentation  that  has  been  produced  before  the   Upper
      Tribunal.


  33. The appellant said that his wife gives him money sometimes when he has
      needs. No benefits are claimed.


  34. Ms Kenny asked how he met her. This was at  a  party  or  function  in
      2010. After that they spoke to each other and started to go out.  They
      exchanged telephone numbers. They met two or three days later and from
      there the relationship developed. He had lived  with  her  since  2010
      when she was in Catford.


  35. On re-examination, when  asked  who  was  responsible  for  "household
      chores" he said that he does the cooking.


  36. He said that his wife is not attending the hearing because she is  not
      feeling well. She is not sick as such. She is not at work  today.  She
      was at work yesterday, i.e., the day before the hearing. She  is  "not
      feeling comfortable" about the whole procedure and how it is  dragging
      on. She is more concerned about not having a miscarriage. She does not
      want to risk "a shock."


  37. The 'sub-lessor', Mr Usu,  has  gone  to  work.  He  knows  about  the
      appellant's situation. He has never refused to give a statement. There
      is however no witness statement from any friends whom  they  have  met
      socially.









           Submissions


  38. Ms Kenny submitted that there is no evidence of a  documentary  nature
      that has been produced to show a durable relationship. The appellant's
      partner was not in attendance. There is  no  proper  evidence  of  her
      pregnancy. There is not even an updating witness statement from either
      the appellant or his partner.


  39. She submitted that such witness statements as there are, are vague  in
      relation to  the alleged durable  relationship.  They  claim  to  have
      lived together for two years. There is no evidence  as  claimed,  that
      "the entire family" support the appeal. No supporting documentation or
      witness statement from any such person has been produced. There is  no
      evidence of the history of the relationship. The  appellant's  partner
      stated in her witness statement that her family has been supportive of
      the relationship. Accordingly there  has  been  only  sparse  evidence
      produced in respect of the durability of their relationship.


  40. As to the alleged pregnancy, the appellant has "a concerning  lack  of
      involvement" which Ms Kenny submitted is not expected in  a  situation
      such as claimed. The appellant has never attended any appointment with
      her. He originally stated that the pregnancy  has  been  monitored  at
      hospital, and later that this was only  the  GP.  She  submitted  that
      '.....you  would  expect  somebody  in  those  circumstances  to  have
      attended and to have shown more interest'.


  41. There  is  moreover  no  evidence  produced  in  confirmation  of  the
      pregnancy from the hospital, or from any other source. At four  months
      there would be such evidence in the form of either scans or GP notes.


  42. Given that the respondent lists the documents that should be  produced
      in a case like this the appellant's response has been  unsatisfactory.
      He originally contended that the respondent's refusal letter  in  this
      regard was "legal jargon." However, the letter is  clear  and  details
      the kind of evidence  which  should  be  produced.  There  is  nothing
      legally technical about that.


  43. In the event she submitted  that  no  documentary  evidence  has  been
      produced confirming the durability of the relationship.


  44. Ms Kenny also referred to the Rule 24 reply by the respondent in  this
      case. The respondent did not oppose the application for permission  to
      appeal and invited the Tribunal to determine the appeal with  a  fresh
      oral hearing to  consider  whether  the  appellant  is  in  a  durable
      relationship. Accordingly, the appellant was again given  notification
      of the nature of the issues on appeal.


  45. Ms Kenny also  referred  to  the  periods  of  separation  which  were
      "concerning." This has not only amounted to a  separation  for  a  few
      days but has sometimes resulted in a separation of some three  months,
      "... a long time.  This does not conform with any notion of a  durable
      relationship".


  46. She repeated that there was no documentary  evidence  such  as  bills.
      Although Ms Alphonse obtains bank statements, there is no  attempt  to
      produce them nor  any  explanation  as  to  why  they  have  not  been
      produced. Furthermore, the payslips are said to be sent  to  the  home
      address. No payslips have been produced which might reveal on the face
      of the slip what his partner's address is.


  47. The appellant was also vague as to the circumstances relating to their
      meeting for the first time. He has given no detail. He cannot remember
      when this took place. He stated  that  it  was  a  party  and  then  a
      function. Nor was there evidence about their residing in Catford.


  48. Ms Kenny referred to the fact that his partner was not  here  to  give
      evidence. The explanation for the non appearance comes only  from  the
      appellant. It is not clear why she is unwell.  She  still  works.  She
      could at least have given some explanation as to why  she  is  not  at
      Court.


  49. Ms Kenny thus submitted that the  appellant  had  not  discharged  the
      burden of proof that rests on him.


  50. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Ume-Ezeoke informed the  Tribunal  that
      he had only '....come into the case two days ago'.


  51.  He  relied  on  both  the  appellant's  and  Ms  Alphonse's   witness
      statements. He submitted that the Tribunal  should  attach  weight  to
      them. He submitted that the explanation as to why she is  not  at  the
      hearing is credible. This morning she was not feeling comfortable  and
      did not want to come. She has had a miscarriage before.


  52. Insofar as his lack of knowledge about the pregnancy is concerned, the
      appellant explained that she goes to  appointments  either  before  or
      after work. This does not mean that he is not interested.


  53. As to the submission that the statements  are  vague  and  lacking  in
      detail, he submitted that the application was refused on two  grounds.
      The appellant "felt passionate" about his assertion that they had been
      lawfully married according to Ghanaian  law.  Documentation  had  been
      produced in relation to that issue.


  54. He submitted that the evidence in any event was not vague.  They  have
      lived together 'on and off'. He has not gone into any great detail  in
      his witness statement. However, having been  asked  questions  he  has
      given answers.


  55. As far as the documentary evidence is concerned, the documentation  he
      produced has related to Regulation 7  of  the  2006  Regulations.  The
      appellant has acted in person. He has not  had  proper  advice  as  to
      documentation.


  56. With regard to separation periods, the last separation  was  in  2011,
      since when they have lived together.


     Assessment


  57. The appellant elected to have his  appeal  considered  on  the  papers
      before the First-tier Tribunal.


  58. The bulk of the written evidence  submitted  to  both  the  first-tier
      Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal, consisted of  documentation  relating
      to Ghanaian customary marriage. Apart from British Gas bills  sent  to
      the appellant and Ms Alphonse, at Dagenham in February 2012, May  2012
      and June 2013, no other documentation evidencing their living together
      at the same address has been produced.  There is no updating  evidence
      of his kind.


  59. The only payslips  produced  were  for  September  and  October  2013.
      However, those payslips do not identify the employee's address.


  60. I have had regard to a letter from the Manager of London Cleaning  and
      Support Services Ltd, the employer, dated 19 July  2013  which  simply
      confirms that Ms Alphonse has been  employed  by  the  company.   This
      letter is addressed "to whom it may concern".


  61. There is no further documentation produced evidencing cohabitation.


  62. I do not  regard  the  reasons  or  explanation  given  for  the  non-
      attendance  of  Ms  Alphonse  to  be  plausible  or  credible  in  the
      circumstances. Ms Alphonse in her witness  statement  dated  14  April
      2014 stated that she  wishes  ".....to  passionately  appeal  that  my
      husband's appeal should be considered  compassionately."  His  removal
      "will be very devastating and detrimental to us as a family."


  63. Notwithstanding the importance of  her  evidence  in  this  case,  she
      decided on the day of the hearing that she did not wish to come as she
      was not well.


  64. However, apart from that assertion by the appellant, no  evidence  has
      been produced as to her current condition. She has been able to  work,
      even on the day prior to the hearing. The further contention that  she
      does not wish to attend the hearing in any event  as  she  is  feeling
      uncomfortable about the whole procedure and how it is dragging on,  is
      not consistent with a claim that she "passionately" wants  the  appeal
      to succeed.


  65. I find that the appellant's statement that she is more concerned about
      not having another miscarriage and does not want to  have  "a  shock,"
      (implying that for some undisclosed reason she does not want  to  risk
      attending the hearing), is not plausible.


  66. I also find that it is clear from the reasons  for  refusal  that  the
      appellant was clearly informed by the respondent as to the  nature  of
      the evidence required to be produced  in  support  of  a  claim  of  a
      durable relationship. This is set out clearly at page 8 of the refusal
      letter. There is no legal or technical jargon involved as asserted  by
      the appellant. In any event, the need to produce that kind of evidence
      is obvious.


  67. The appellant was subsequently also informed by the respondent in  the
      Rule 24 response that a continuance hearing would explore the  alleged
      durable relationship. However, no single document  has  been  produced
      since the date the application was submitted. No further  or  updating
      payslips or bank statements or any other  documents  evidencing  joint
      tenancy have been produced. His  application  for  permission  to  the
      Upper Tribunal appears to have been drafted  with  the  assistance  of
      either a legal representative, or  a  person  who  is  aware  of  what
      evidence is required. The application has included reference  to  case
      law.


  68. I thus find that the appellant has had ample  opportunity  to  produce
      relevant documentation for this appeal.


  69. Nor has there been any attempt to obtain a witness statement from  the
      "sub-lessor" confirming the fact that they have lived together at  the
      same address for the period alleged. No reason has been  given  as  to
      why such statement could not have been produced.


  70. Nor has the appellant produced any evidence from any family member  of
      his partner or from any of their friends or neighbours confirming  the
      existence, nature, and extent  of the relationship.


  71. The appellant's oral evidence in that respect was vague and  sometimes
      contradictory. He stated that his wife has been attending at  hospital
      in relation to her current pregnancy. However, he subsequently  stated
      that she had only gone to  her  GP.  No  evidence  has  been  produced
      confirming either the fact of his partner's alleged current  pregnancy
      nor any evidence relating to her alleged miscarriage  some  two  years
      ago.


  72. I also take into account that there have been five or six  significant
      periods when they separated. Although this is said  to  have  occurred
      more than two years ago, this indicates more than a "misunderstanding"
      which is the way the appellant described it.


  73. Having regard to the evidence as a whole, I find  that  the  appellant
      has not shown on the balance of probabilities that he is  an  extended
      family member as set out in Regulation 8 of the 2006 Regulations.


  74. I accordingly find that his application  was  properly  refused  under
      Regulation 8(5) of the Regulations. The decision of the respondent was
      thus in accordance with the law and the 2006 Regulations.
