                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge M Robertson, promulgated on  20th  September  2017,  following  a
    hearing at Birmingham, Sheldon Court  on  14th  August  2017.   In  the
    determination,  the  judge  dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,
    following  which  the  Appellant  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen  of  Iraq,  who  was  born  on  27th
    February 1991.  He appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    dated 15th February 2016, to refuse to grant him asylum and  to  refuse
    to grant him humanitarian protection under paragraph 336 of HC 395  (as
    amended).

 3. The appeal had initially been heard by IJ Hall on 6th  September  2016.
    The Appellant had failed to attend and the  appeal  was  refused.   The
    decision was subsequently set aside on 31st January 2017  and  remitted
    back for a rehearing, and it was  in  these  circumstances  that  IJ  M
    Robertson determined the appeal.

 4. At the hearing before IJ M  Robertson,  the  Appellant  was  again  not
    present.  The judge observed how the  Appellant's  representatives  had
    clearly received a letter of notification and there is  no  justifiable
    reason to adjourn, particularly as the Appellant  had  not  attended  a
    previous  hearing  either,  and   had   decided   not   to   keep   his
    representatives informed (see paragraph 10).

 5. For the reasons that the judge gave in the determination, namely,  that
    it was entirely reasonable for the Appellant to travel to Baghdad  with
    a laissez passer, and from there make his way from Baghdad to IKR, that
    the  decision  of  the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State  was  entirely
    sustainable.  The Appellant  was  a  Kurd  and  in  the  interview  had
    referred to having travelled there before.  He was a resourceful  young
    man.  He had left his family in Turkey to travel to  the  UK  where  he
    knew no-one (see paragraph 23).

 6. On 19th October 2017, permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal against the decision of IJ M Robertson on the basis  that
    the suggestion that the Appellant could safely travel up to the IKR (at
    paragraph 23) from Baghdad, was not sustainable.

 7. A Rule 24 response was entered on 8th November 2017.

 8. At the hearing before me on 8th December 2017, Mr Howard, appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, was handed a copy of the Rule 24  response  of
    8th November 2017.  This stated, at the last paragraph (at paragraph 5)
    that the Appellant had failed to attend when his appeal  was  initially
    heard on 6th  September  2016  and  had  again  failed  to  attend  the
    rehearing  of  his  appeal  on  14th  September  2017.   However,  "the
    Respondent wishes to advise the Tribunal that  the  Appellant  made  an
    Assisted Voluntary Return to Iraq on 4th July 2016, flying from  London
    Heathrow to Sulaymaniah via Doha".  Mr Howard, confessed not to  having
    seen a copy of the Rule 24 response before.  He accepted  that  in  the
    circumstances the suggestion that the Appellant could not  return  back
    to the IKR, via Baghdad, was unsustainable, because the  Appellant  had
    already voluntarily returned on 4th July 2016.

 9. In fact, the matter, in relation to the reasonableness of return  under
    Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive, has to  be  evaluated  in
    the context of Judge Robertson's own statement that the Appellant "is a
    Kurd and in  interview  referred  to  having  travelled  there  before"
    (paragraph 23).  This suggests that, not only  had  the  Appellant  now
    taken a package and returned by way of  assisted  return  on  4th  July
    2016, but had also previously returned.

10. Mr Bates, appearing as Senior Home Office Presenting Officer,  for  his
    part, handed up also the notice of  directions  to  remove  an  illegal
    entrant, dated 23rd June 2016, which sets out how the Appellant was  to
    board flight QR008 to Doha on 4th July 2016 and then take a  connecting
    flight QR454 to Sulaymaniah on 5th July 2016.  He  suggested  that  the
    Appellant had not been able to attend the previous hearings because  he
    was not in the country.

11. In the  circumstances  the  appeal  must  be  treated  as  having  been
    abandoned as the Appellant is no longer in the jurisdiction.

12. This appeal is dismissed.

13. No anonymity direction is made.
