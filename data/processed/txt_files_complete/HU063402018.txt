Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Turner of Counsel instructed by Latif
Solicitors.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this matter the Secretary of State was granted permission to  appeal
    against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bircher  who  had
    allowed the Appellant's appeal pursuant to Article  8  ECHR.   To  ease
    following this decision I shall refer to Mr Ali Akber as the  claimant,
    noting that it is the Secretary of State who brings this  appeal.   The
    FTT Judge had allowed the claimant's appeal against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision dated 9 February 2018  refusing  Indefinite  Leave  to
    Remain, albeit the Judge allowed the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.


2.   The Secretary of State's grounds of  appeal  in  summary  had  said  as
    follows:-


    (1)  That the judge had made a material  misdirection  of  law  because
         following  the  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  R  (on  the
         application of Samant) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
         [2017] UKAIT  and  Abbasi  JR/13807/2016  that  the  Appellant  was
         personally responsible for his own tax affairs and  given  that  he
         would personally receive his tax bill, he  would  have  been  fully
         aware of the amounts declared to HMRC  or  the  fact  that  no  tax
         return was in fact made.  Paragraphs 73 and 74 of  Abbasi  referred
         to which said in part:-


             "Essentially the applicant must take  responsibility  for  his
             own tax affairs.  Not only would the applicant  have  supplied
             the figures to his accountant, he would have checked them  and
             would individually have received a tax bill".


    (2)  R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
         Department (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5))  [2015]  UKUT
         00384 head note (iv) which said as follows:-


             "For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for an
             error in relation to the historical tax return will not be the
             end of the matter, given that the accountant  will  or  should
             have asked the tax  payer  to  confirm  that  the  return  was
             accurate and to have signed the tax return.  Furthermore,  the
             Applicant will have known of his or her earnings and will have
             expected to pay tax thereon.  If the Applicant does  not  take
             steps within a reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the
             Secretary of State may  be  entitled  to  conclude  that  this
             failure justifies a conclusion that there has been  deceit  or
             dishonesty ...".


3.   Towards the end of the grounds of appeal it is said on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State:-


         "It is argued that the view of the HMRC regarding the treatment  of
         arrears is not relevant to 322(5) assessments - and, in any  event,
         does not address the possibility that the original tax records were
         correct, but the Appellant falsified higher earnings  in  order  to
         qualify under Tier 1 as there are several reasons  why  HMRC  would
         not seek to take further action (as highlighted above  in  [22]  of
         Samant) it is submitted that it is a material error of law to  find
         that the lack of action by HMRC is  determinative  of  whether  the
         Appellant has acted dishonestly".


4.   Since the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  and  indeed  since
    the grounds of appeal were drafted, the Court of Appeal has handed down
    its judgment in Balajigari & Others v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2019] EWCA Civ 673.  That judgment  deals  in  detail  with
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules and also considers  the  case
    of Khan which I have referred to already at paragraph  2(2)  above  and
    was a decision of Martin Spencer J. In my  judgment,  the  decision  in
    Khan remains important and was specifically considered in Balajigari. I
    shall return to it.


5.   At the hearing before me during  oral  submissions,   Mr  McVeety  said
    that he relied on the grounds of appeal  and  that  there  had  been  a
    failure by the claimant to lodge the tax documents "in their entirety".
     There was no evidence from the previous accountants.  Mr McVeety  took
    me to paragraph 106 of Balajigari and said that a  mere  assertion  was
    not sufficient.  An explanation needed to be provided, but here nothing
    had been provided and there was no evidence to say that the accountants
    were not in business and the Appellant had fallen foul of the Court  of
    Appeal case in this decision.  Mr McVeety took me to  paragraph  31  of
    the judge's decision where the judge had said in part as follows:-


         "This application was refused because of a failure on the part of a
         professional accountant to submit his self-assessment tax return in
         the first year of his business".


6.   The judge has said that the Appellant did not realise  his  tax  return
    had not been submitted but that was a perverse finding.  The  Appellant
    had not submitted his  earnings.   The  fact  that  there  was  no  tax
    liability required  the  Appellant  to  consider  the  situation.   The
    Appellant should have asked why was there no  demand  from  HMRC.   The
    judge's finding that this was a "simple" mistake was  just  wrong.   It
    was not a matter of a "couple of hundred pounds here  or  there".   The
    earnings were in the region of �50,000 or so.  The point being that any
    one acting reasonably would know that they would have a  tax  liability
    and would make enquiries.


7.   Mr Turner in his submissions took me first to his skeleton argument.  I
    shall not refer to all of it, but I shall summarise  it  alongside  the
    oral submissions which largely reflected  what  was  said  in  it.  The
    skeleton argument and submission were that the  Home  Office's  grounds
    were flawed. That any  negative  factor  raised  in  the  determination
    should have resulted in dismissal and that the Secretary of  State  had
    failed to have regard to the fact  that  paragraph  322(5)  was  not  a
    mandatory ground.  The cases of Abbasi and  Samant  were  not  reported
    cases and that  no  weight  should  be  reported  upon  them.   In  the
    alternative the Appellant relied on the case of Bapio Action Ltd  which
    was authority for the proposition that where one Government  body  acts
    in a certain way in pursuance of a statutory duty imposed upon it, then
    this is considered to be important and an information action  on  other
    Government bodies.  It was said that the Home Office grounds failed  to
    engage with  the  determination.   It  is  clear  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge did have the decision of Khan in mind and  that  it  was
    submitted that when granting permission Judge O'Garro  failed  to  have
    proper consideration of the fact that the Appellant was  a  person  who
    had been lawfully in the UK for a period of twelve years at the date of
    application.  It was also necessary to consider the Home  Office's  own
    operational instructions at page 2 which states that discrepancies with
    the HMRC data are just one aspect of the  genuineness  assessment  when
    dealing  with  applications  from  Tier  1  migrants.   The   Appellant
    therefore had failed to have regard to his own guidance in treating the
    tax amendment as the definitive factor in the case.  It  was  submitted
    that the Secretary of State was merely seeking  to  re-argue  the  case
    rather than challenge the matter as an error of law.


8.   The Secretary of State  had  not  made  out  the  burden  of  proof  in
    establishing dishonesty and the Appellant sought to rely on the  recent
    decision in Balajigari.  There were long extracts  from  Balajigari  in
    the skeleton argument including paragraphs 34,  35,  37  and  221.   In
    conclusion it was submitted that the Secretary of State's appeal  ought
    to be dismissed.


9.   In his oral submissions Mr Turner also repeated  some  of  the  matters
    and he said that the key factor was that the previous accountants  were
    "shut".  He said in respect of the money, the �50,000, that ignored the
    evidence in the case, that the Appellant took on a business  which  was
    loss-making.  There was a difference between nothing  being  filed  and
    specific cases where no returns had been filed.  I was  taken  at  some
    length to the Court of Appeal's decision  in  Balajigari.   I  enquired
    about the evidence in respect of  the  accountants  having  been  "shut
    down" but all I was shown was a witness statement  in  the  Appellant's
    bundle which was before the FtT Judge dated 3rd July 2018 which said at
    paragraph 15:-


         "I confirm that I had closed the previous business as I had  opened
         a new business venture and therefore I had to let go of my previous
         accountant.  I confirm that sometime around 2012-2013 the  previous
         accountancy firm had closed down and there was no way  to  retrieve
         any information from them."


10.   Now,  I  have  looked  carefully  through  the  judge's  decision  but
    ultimately there is no actual finding in respect of this aspect.  In my
    judgment this was a crucial aspect  of  the  claimant's  case.   In  my
    judgment the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal which  specifically
    ask the question of how the Appellant was taking responsibility for his
    tax affairs needed answering in terms of the former accountants. I also
    look at the Secretary of State's Refusal Letter. It is 11  pages  long.
    Pages 3 and 4 set out in some detail the history of the claimant's Tier
    1 applications to the Home Office and the history of  his  declarations
    of income in those applications, compared to the tax returns filed with
    HMRC. I will not set all of that out, but in summary the position is as
    follows:


      1) As part of his Tier 1 application on  4  April  2011  the  claimant
         claimed to have an income of �53.086.00 and so he  was  awarded  30
         points for "previous earnings'  categories.  Whereas  in  fact  the
         revised tax calculation dated 10 August 2017 showed that the  total
         declared income was zero. Had the claimant declared income of  zero
         then no points would have been awarded and he would  not  meet  the
         points requirement for  leave  to  remain.  The  same  revised  tax
         calculation now showed total tax income of �57,248 including �12084
         from PAYE and �44,444 from a dividend and so this was now  in  line
         with the earnings declared to HMRC.


      2) The refusal letter went on to say that it was not credible  that  a
         registered accountant would submit  a  self-assessment  tax  return
         declaring  earnings  which  were  considerably  lower  than   their
         client's actual earnings.


      3) There was a similar auditing-type of examination for the  tax  year
         2012 to 2013.


11.  In my judgment it was incumbent upon the judge to deal with this  issue
    in terms of the accountants who were involved previously. The Court  of
    Appeal in Balajigari made clear at paragraph 106 that a mere  assertion
    of a mistake would be sufficient. In reality, there  was  nothing  more
    than that assertion in this case. The fact that  there  was  this  very
    large amount of income, some �50,000 meant it could  not  be  that  the
    accountants could simply have disappeared and that it was not  possible
    to get the information which had  been  submitted,  even  if  they  had
    closed down in 2012/2013. Nor do I accept Mr Turner's  submission  that
    because "Schedule 24 of the Finance Act  2007  confirms  that  HMRC  is
    statutorily bound to consider imposing a penalty and, as  such,  it  is
    submitted that Abbasi  has  arguably  been  decided  in  error.  It  is
    submitted that if HMRC have  chosen  not  to  prosecute  the  Applicant
    [then] UKVI ought not to behind their  decision  and  place  their  own
    penalties on the Applicant, i.e. refuse ILR...". The reason  I  do  not
    agree with Mr Turner's submission is because the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Balajigari made clear at paragraphs  69  to  72  the  opposite  to  his
    submission:


         "66.  In  his  most  bold  submission  Mr  Saini  submitted   that,
         when paragraph 1 of Schedule 24 to the Finance Act  2007 provides
         that, in the circumstances to  which  it  applies,  a  penalty  "is
         payable", that means that there is always an obligation  to  pay  a
         penalty and therefore one would always be imposed. On  that  basis,
         he submitted that if the Secretary of State made enquiries of  HMRC
         and discovered that a penalty had not been imposed in a given  case
         that would mean that HMRC had  believed  that  a  penalty  was  not
         payable and thus that it had believed that the error was  innocent:
         otherwise a penalty would have been imposed.


         67.   We  reject  that  submission.  The  statutory  language  ("is
         payable") simply means that a liability to pay a penalty arises if
         the statutory criteria are satisfied. It does not mean there  is  a
         duty on HMRC to impose a penalty in every case where  it  might  in
         principle be imposed.  We  are  conscious  that  we  did  not  hear
         detailed submissions on this issue, and in particular that we  have
         not heard anything that might be said on behalf of HMRC.  We  shall
         therefore say no more about the issue here.


         68.  At one stage, at least in his written  submissions,  Mr  Saini
         appeared to suggest  that  it  is  legally  impermissible  for  the
         Secretary of State to take a different view from HMRC  in  relation
         to the same matter. He referred to this in his skeleton argument as
         the "dichotomous views" of HMRC as distinct from the  Home  Office.
         We did not understand him to press that submission. In  any  event,
         in our judgment, the submission is a  bad  one.  The  Secretary  of
         State has the legal power to decide the questions which arise under
         paragraph 322 (5) for himself and is certainly not  bound  to  take
         the same view as HMRC. The two public  authorities  are  performing
         different functions and have different statutory powers."


12.  Alternatively, in my judgment it was incumbent upon the judge  to  have
    made a finding in line with the claimant's witness statement which  set
    out what it did about the history of his former accountants.   Did  the
    Judge accept that  evidence  or  not?  The  losing  party,  namely  the
    Secretary of State in this case, was entitled to know what the  finding
    was.  In  my  judgment  Mr  Turner's  submissions  that  the   previous
    accountants had been "shut down" required an actual finding.  There  is
    reference to that assertion within the claimant's witness statement  as
    I have said, above at paragraph 9.  It was a fundamental issue.   There
    is no finding by the judge on  it.    That  properly  reasoned  finding
    ought to have been made.  It cannot be inferred or implied. Nor can  it
    be  assumed.  It  is  not  merely  an  issue  of  there  being  a  mere
    disagreement. I am well aware of the  Court  of  Appeal's  judgment  in
    R(Iran).  In my judgment Mr McVeety is correct to submit that this  was
    such a large amount of money, namely some �50,000.  It would be obvious
    that tax would be payable and waiting some 6 years to  correct  matters
    required more than just an assertion that the previous accountants were
    to blame but were 'not around any longer'. This was  the  crux  of  the
    claimant's claim and that required a properly reasoned finding  by  the
    Judge on it as being essential.


13.  I have not found  the  Home  Office  policy  "Operational  Instructions
    Relating to Earnings Discrepancies and Applications by Tier 1 (General)
    Migrants issued on 22 November 2016 and which Mr Turner  relied  on  as
    assisting the claimant at this error of law hearing. That policy refers
    to interviewing the applicant and such like, and that discrepancies are
    one factor, but I do not see how that aids the claimant in  respect  of
    the fundamental issue in this case. The Judge at paragraph 31 concluded
    that there was a failure on the part of the accountant  to  submit  the
    Appellant's self-assessment tax return and that the Appellant sought to
    remedy this once it came to light. That was an irrational finding.  The
    delay was some 6 years and the initial amount of income was zero. There
    was no properly reasoned finding or evidence that the failure was  that
    of the accountants or  from  the  information  that  the  claimant  had
    provided to his accountants. I referred to Khan which the Secretary  of
    States grounds stressed at paragraph 2(2)  above.  The  claimant  falls
    foul of that. I should say too that Mr Turner has said all  he  can  on
    behalf  of  the  claimant,  but  I  am  not  able  to  agree  with  his
    submissions.  In the circumstances I conclude that there is a  material
    error of law in the judge's decision.  In my judgment the error  is  of
    such a fundamental nature that none of the  current  determination  can
    stand and therefore this matter has  to  be  considered  further  at  a
    hearing.  I have considered whether or not that  hearing  ought  to  be
    here at the Upper Tribunal  or  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  my
    judgment the appropriate venue is at the First-tier Tribunal, not least
    because it will give the Appellant a longer opportunity to  obtain  the
    evidence which, if so advised, he may seek to file and serve, to enable
    him to meet the Court  of  Appeal's  judgment  in  Balajigari.   It  is
    relevant to note that the decision in Balajigari was handed down  since
    the First-tier Tribunal's decision. Further, because I am setting aside
    the decision of the Judge in full,  it  provides  the  opportunity  for
    there to be a hearing on all issues at the First tier Tribunal.


Notice of Decision


The First-tier Tribunal decision discloses a material  error  of  law.   The
First-tier Tribunal's decision allowing the claimant's appeal is set  aside.
 There will be a further hearing on all matters at a de novo hearing at  the
First-tier Tribunal hearing in due course.  None  of  the  current  findings
shall stand.


No anonymity direction is made.
