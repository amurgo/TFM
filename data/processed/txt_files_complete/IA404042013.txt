                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 29th October 1984.   The
    Appellant had been granted leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (Student)
    Migrant but that leave had been curtailed  so  as  to  expire  on  19th
    November 2012 under the provisions of paragraph 323A(b)(i) of  HC 395.
    The Appellant subsequently applied for leave to remain on the basis  of
    his family and private life but that application was  refused  for  the
    reasons given in a Notice of Decision dated 2nd August  2013.   On  9th
    August 2013, the Respondent decided to remove the Appellant  under  the
    provisions of Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act  1999.   The
    Appellant appealed, and his appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Perry (the Judge) sitting at  Hatton  Cross  on  31st January
    2014.  Having heard evidence and submissions concerning the substantive
    issues in the appeal, the Judge decided to dismiss the appeal by way of
    finding that he was without jurisdiction as the Appellant did not  have
    a right of appeal.  The Appellant sought leave to appeal that  decision
    and on 14th March 2014 such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. At the hearing it was agreed by the representatives that the Judge  had
    so erred in law and  that  his  decision  should  be  set  aside.   The
    Appellant had appealed a decision to remove him under the provisions of
    Section 10  of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  1999  which  is  an
    appealable immigration decision as defined by Section 82(2)(g)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  That right of appeal  is
    exercisable by the Appellant in  country  in  accordance  with  Section
    92(4)(a) of the 2002 Act as the Appellant had made a prior human rights
    claim.  I so find.

 4. As the substantive issues in the appeal have not been resolved  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I decided not to remake the decision  but  instead
    to remit the appeal to that Tribunal to be reheard there in  accordance
    with paragraph 7.2(a) of the Practice Statements.

Decision

 5. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside.  The appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be reheard by a Judge other than Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Perry.

Anonymity

 6. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I see
    no reason to do so.
