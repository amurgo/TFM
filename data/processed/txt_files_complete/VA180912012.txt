                      ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, CHENNAI

                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent appeals with permission against the determination of the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Archer,  promulgated  on  12  November  2012
    dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision   of   the
    respondent made  on  17  April  2012  to  refuse  to  grant  her  entry
    clearance. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on  4
    December 2012 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers.

 2. The matter then came before me on 16 January   2013  when  I  gave  the
    following directions:-

   1. Standard directions required the appellant  in  these  proceedings  to
      serve within 21 days, and the respondent in these  proceedings  within
      28 days: a skeleton argument unless relying solely on the  grounds  of
      appeal; and, any further evidence not before the FtT on  which  it  is
      intended to rely, accompanied by the notice  required  under  rule  15
      (2A) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008.  The
      directions also required the respondent in these proceedings  to  file
      within 28 days, any response to the notice of appeal pursuant to  rule
      24 of the rules.


   2. It is my preliminary view that, as is set out in the grounds of appeal
      [5 to 9] that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  erred  in  his  implicit
      assessment [23] that the available accommodation would be overcrowded,
      given that for the purposes of assessing statutory overcrowding on the
      spaces basis. Children under 10 count as ï¿½ and children under 1 do not
      count at all - see sections 324 to 326 of the Housing Act 1985. Hence,
      if two adults and the younger child ( under 1) occupied one room,  and
      the appellant, grandmother and  the  sponsor's  older  child  occupied
      another room, there would be no statutory overcrowding on  either  the
      space or room standard, children under 10 not counting for the  latter
      standard.

   3. Accordingly, as the sole issue on which the appeal was  dismissed  was
      the adequacy of accommodation, unless within five  working  days  from
      the issue of these directions I receive  written  submissions  setting
      out cogent arguments to the contrary, I propose to  allow  the  appeal
      without an oral hearing.

 3. These directions were not, however issued until 28 May 2013,  owing  to
    an  administrative  error.  There  has  been  no  response   to   these
    directions. Accordingly, I am satisfied that neither party  objects  to
    the matter being determined without a hearing and has  nothing  further
    to say. I am satisfied that, for the reasons set out in the grounds  of
    appeal, that the determination of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve
    the making of an error of law and requires to be remade insofar as  the
    issue of the adequacy of accommodation is concerned. The other findings
    in favour of the appellant are preserved

 4. I am satisfied for the reasons given above that the accommodation  that
    would be available would not be statutorily  overcrowded  or  otherwise
    inadequate. I therefore find that the requirements of  the  immigration
    rules are met and I allow the appeal on that basis.

Summary of conclusions

     1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making
        of an error of law and I set it aside.
     2. I allow the appeal under the immigration rules.

Judge of the Upper Tribunal
TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE ORDER

Note:  this does not form part of the determination.


As I have allowed the appeal, I have considered making a fee order in
favour of the appellant. I consider that, as the appeal has been allowed
primarily on the basis of evidence already before the respondent, that it
is appropriate to make a full fee order in favour of the appellant of any
fee paid.
