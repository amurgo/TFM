Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr R Solomon, Counsel instructed by Hodders Law
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                         REMAKE DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the remaking of a decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Miles
    which was promulgated on 9 August 2016.  That decision was set aside by
    me on 26 May 2017 and, for convenience, I annex to  this  determination
    my Decision and Reasons.
2.   In brief summary, the first appellant came to  the  United  Kingdom  in
    January 2011 under a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant  visa.  This
    expired on 29 June 2012, but was extended until 30  August  2013.   Her
    husband and their  two  children  (the  second  to  fourth  appellants)
    arrived on 4 April 2011, when [ARD] was 5 years of age and the  younger
    child, [AND], was 2.  They are now 11 and 9 respectively.

3.   [ARD] has now embarked upon his secondary  education  at  Wembley  High
    Technology College and has just completed his first year. He is  making
    good progress  notwithstanding  a  diagnosis  of  ADHD.   He  is  fully
    absorbed into the education system in  the  United  Kingdom,  has  made
    friends and undertakes extra curricular activities, including football.
     English is his first language, although he had spoken Tagalog while in
    the Philippines.  It is said, and I have no reason to  doubt,  that  he
    identifies himself as English.

4.   It is the younger child, [AND],  however,  who  has  been  the  primary
    focus of these proceedings as, by common consent, the  outcome  of  her
    appeal will also be determinative of those of the other three.

     The issue for determination

5.   It was confirmed at the outset of the  hearing  that  the  findings  of
    fact of Judge Miles are preserved, and this was an  appropriate  matter
    for the consideration of Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules. There
    was no challenge to Judge Miles' conclusion (under section  55  of  the
    Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009) that  best  interests  of
    the children lay in them remaining in the United Kingdom.

6.   The single issue for  me,  therefore,  is  the  balancing  exercise  in
    deciding  whether  the  statutory  factors  regarding  maintenance   of
    immigration control were such as to outweigh those best  interests,  as
    expressly identified in a passage of the judgment of Clarke  LJ  in  EV
    (Philippines) & Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014]
    EWCA Civ 874. Paragraph 36 reads as follows:

     "In a sense the Tribunal is  concerned  with  how  emphatic  an  answer
         falls to be given to the question: is it in the best  interests  of
         the child to remain?  The longer the child has been here, the  more
         advanced (or critical) the stage of his education, the  looser  his
         ties with the country in question, and  the  more  deleterious  the
         consequences of his return, the greater the weight that falls  into
         one side of the scales.  If it is  overwhelmingly  in  the  child's
         best interests that he should not  return,  the  need  to  maintain
         immigration control may well not tip the balance.  By  contrast  if
         it is in the child's best interests to remain, but only on  balance
         (with some factors pointing the other way), the result may  be  the
         opposite." (emphasis added)

7.   No evidence was  called  by  either  party,  although  some  additional
    material was introduced by Mr Solomon of counsel for the appellants.  I
    therefore heard submissions on the appropriate  balance  to  be  struck
    between the best interests of  the  children  and  the  maintenance  of
    immigration control.

     The appellants' case

8.   Mr Solomon made reference to the first appellant's mother, Glory,  with
    whom the family resides and who provides  financial  support,  together
    with the appellant's sister Juliet, who  lives  separately  but  is  in
    regular contact with the family, and as long ago as 2015 was  making  a
    contribution in the order of �100 per  week  towards  their  day-to-day
    expenditure.  Glory and Juliet are both employed by the National Health
    Service.  Glory receives an income in the order of  �19,000  per  annum
    gross and that of Juliet is broadly similar.

8.   [AND] has  been  diagnosed  with  autism  spectrum  disorder.  She  has
    learning difficulties and limited speech.   She  has  no  awareness  of
    danger and she cannot walk for prolonged periods.  She  needs  24  hour
    care.  She has possible nephrocalcinosis which is a  condition  of  the
    kidney  and   sensory   modulation   difficulties.    She   has   sleep
    difficulties, hyperacusis and  bicuspid  aortic  valve.   These  latter
    heart-related conditions appear  to  have  received  investigation  and
    referred without treatment for review in four to five years.

9.   Correspondence from the [AND]'s general practitioner in the form  of  a
    letter dated 8 June 2017 makes reference to these matters being serious
    and life-threatening conditions.

10.  Mr Solomon submitted that [AND] is no ordinary child: she suffers  from
    autism and  as  a  result  is  particularly  resistant  to  changes  of
    circumstances, which would be de-stabilising.  She is  the  subject  of
    ongoing  health  concerns  with  clinical  intervention  on  a   multi-
    disciplinary basis.

11.  [AND] was seen in March of 2011 at a clinic in the  University  of  the
    Philippines, General Hospital, where Williams syndrome was  considered.
    This provisional diagnosis was  made  in  the  Philippines  before  the
    family arrived in the United  Kingdom.   It  is  not  disputed  that  a
    conclusive diagnosis would have required a visit to Australia.

12.  In relation to the adequacy and availability of  medical  treatment  in
    the Philippines, Mr Solomon compiled a clip of documentation drawn from
    various resources.  These included a report on the Philippines from the
    Foreign & Commonwealth Office  Travel  Department;  the  United  States
    Department of State Country Report on Human  Rights  dealing  with  the
    Philippines, and particularly with persons with  disabilities;  and  an
    extract from Business World Online  entitled  "Philippine  health  care
    system, from bad to worse" (28 March 2016).

14.  There  is  also  a  letter  from  Sister  Juliet  Rose,  the  Executive
    Principle at Pield Heath House School  which  [AND]  currently  attends
    which says as follows:

     "As a member of a religious order I have been to visit the  Philippines
         where our sisters and staff work with children and young people who
         have similar disabilities to [AND] and  I  do  not  feel  that  the
         provision that would be available would be as  beneficial  to  that
         which she is already receiving here at Pield Health.  Unfortunately
         the services are not  as  well  co-ordinated  particularly  in  the
         education of youngsters with severe  learning  difficulties  and  a
         therapeutic provision that [AND] desperately needs".

15.  In terms  of  affordability  the  evidence  in  the  first  appellant's
    witness statement (paragraph 34) indicates that the minimum daily  wage
    in the Philippines is in the order of �8.85 and  the  cost  on  [AND]'s
    medical therapy session and school  fees  would  be  in  the  order  of
    �1,680.47 monthly.  Documentary  evidence  confirms  this.  The  second
    appellant's income is currently �25,000 per year  gross  for  the  year
    ending April 2017, slightly down on  �26,000  gross  for  the  previous
    year. It would fall dramatically were he to return to the  Philippines.
    His evidence is that the family business in  which  he  was  previously
    engaged no longer operates. The first appellant would be unable to work
    in the Philippines as she would have to  care  for  the  [AND]  in  the
    absence of the family support which she currently enjoys in the  United
    Kingdom.

16.   Mr  Solomon  argues  that  that  the  maintenance  of  immigration  of
    immigration control should not prevail in the particular  circumstances
    of this case. Referring to section 117B (reproduced below)  he  submits
    that all the appellants speak English and are well integrated and not a
    burden on society; that their continued presence in the United  Kingdom
    has not been unlawful (as Mr Bramble concedes) but  merely  precarious.
    The second appellant is employed,  drawing  a  respectable  salary  and
    contributing by way of tax and national insurances to public  services.
    The use of educational and health services for [AND]'s benefit has  not
    been exploitative but on a contributory basis. This will continue.

17.  Mr  Solomon  contends  that  it  overwhelmingly  in  the  [AND]'s  best
    interests that she should remain in  the  United  Kingdom.  She  has  a
    debilitating and complex  medical  condition  for  which  there  is  no
    affordable treatment in the Philippines. It would be deleterious to her
    health and well-being were she to leave the United  Kingdom.  Therefore
    the need to maintain immigration control should not therefore  tip  the
    balance in the Article 8  assessment.   He  invites  me  to  allow  the
    appeal.

    The respondent's case


18.  Mr Bramble, on behalf of the Secretary of State, does not seek to  step
    aside from accepting the  finding  that  the  best  interests  of  both
    children are served by them remaining in the United  Kingdom.  However,
    he submits these are outweighed by the need  tom  maintain  immigration
    control.

19.  He made particular reference in the general  practitioner's  letter  to
    the low-level of [AND]'s medication and the  apparent  absence  of  any
    particular  treatment.  He also points to the absence of anything other
    than general comments about the absence of medical  facilities  in  the
    Philippines, and its cost putting it beyond the reach of  most  of  the
    population. There is a paucity of evidence directly referable to [AND],
    her needs, and her family's likely future  circumstances.  He  suggests
    that the salaries of the first  appellant's  mother  and  sister  would
    still be available to help defray a portion of the costs.

20.  Mr Bramble referred me to the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  Akhalu
    (health claim: ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT  400  (IAC),  in  particular
    paragraph 45:

         "The correct approach is for the judge  to  have  regard  to  every
         aspect of  the  claimant's  private  life  here,  as  well  as  the
         consequences for her health of removal, but to have  in  mind  when
         striking the balance of proportionality that a comparison of levels
         of medical treatment available is something that will not in itself
         have any real impact on the outcome of the exercise. The judge must
         recognise [...] that it will be a rare  case  that  succeeds  where
         this is an important aspect of the claimant's case."


    He readily  conceded,  however,  that  this  case  concerned  an  adult
    claimant and that the position with a child might be different.

21.  Mr Bramble urged me to dismiss the appeal and to  affirm  the  decision
    of the Secretary of State.

     The law

22.  There were no contentious issues regarding the law to be applied.  Both
    representatives agreed on the relevance of the passage from  Clarke  LJ
    in EV (Philippines) quoted above, and  cited  more  extensively  in  my
    Error Law decision (annexed hereto). It is helpful to set out  in  full
    the content of section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002:

         "117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable  in  all
         cases:
         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
             public interest.
         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English -
             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
              (b) are better able to integrate into society.
         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons -
              (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
              (b)      are better able to integrate into society.
         (4)  Little weight should be given to-
             (a)  a private life, or
             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.
         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
             a person at a time when the  person's  immigration  status  is
             precarious.
         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where-
             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and
             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom."

     Assessment

23.   Notwithstanding  the  complex  procedural   history   and   voluminous
    evidence, the  matter  can  be  disposed  of  relatively  briefly.  The
    combined effect of the medical evidence regarding [AND]'s  health,  and
    that concerning the availability  and  affordability  of  any  suitable
    healthcare (let alone something of  a  commensurate  standard  to  that
    which she is currently receiving) is such that it is overwhelmingly  in
    her best interests to remain in the United Kingdom. I  have  particular
    regard to Sister Juliet Rose's evidence concerning  the  experience  of
    her own religious order in the  Philippines.  [AND]'s  schooling  would
    effectively cease as would any specialist treatment for her spectrum of
    conditions. The modest financial assistance from [AND]'s  wider  family
    in the United Kingdom, even if it were to continue at the same level as
    present, would be wholly insufficient to  bring  the  cost  of  medical
    treatment and specialist schooling within  reach.  [AND]'s  is  a  very
    unusual case.

24.  It follows that the public interest in the maintenance  of  immigration
    control may not necessarily tip the  balance.  In  the  particular  and
    exceptional circumstances of this appeal, I consider that such  balance
    can only be struck in favour of [AND] remaining in the United  Kingdom.
    Her best interests outweigh the maintenance of immigration  control.  I
    bear in mind also, although these factors are not  determinative,  that
    her family is well integrated into the  United  Kingdom,  speak  fluent
    English, and that [AND]'s father has been, and remains,  in  full  time
    employment contributing to the economy.

25.  This case has proceeded on the basis that  the  appeals  of  the  other
    appellants are parasitic upon  the  outcome  of  [AND]'s.  Accordingly,
    since her appeal is to be allowed so will those of  first,  second  and
    third appellants.


Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal having been set  aside,  it  is  now
remade, allowing the appeal of all four appellants on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.

Signed   Mark Hill                      Date     7 August 2017

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Hill QC
                                  APPENDIX

                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal  from  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Miles, promulgated on 9 August 2016. The appeal  relates  to  a  family
    unit who are all citizens of the Philippines and the  particular  focus
    of the appeal has been the welfare  of  one  of  two  children  of  the
    family, namely [AND], the fourth appellant.

2.   The brief history of this matter is that the first appellant  was  born
    on 14 September 1979 and in 2013 applied for leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.  She identified her husband and their two children (the
    second, third and fourth appellants) as dependants.   That  application
    was rejected by the Secretary of State under paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules, on the basis that it had not been established  on  a
    balance of probabilities that the parents would face  very  significant
    obstacles to their reintegration in the Philippines. Mr Eaton, who acts
    for all of the appellants, does not challenge that finding.

3.   In relation to the two children there was no available claim under  the
    Immigration Rules because neither  had  been  resident  in  the  United
    Kingdom for the qualifying period of seven years.

4.   At  paragraph  29  of  the  decision,  the  judge  considered  whether,
    notwithstanding the failure of the claim under the  Immigration  Rules,
    there were compelling circumstances to support a claim for the grant of
    leave outside the Rules. Being satisfied that there were, he  proceeded
    to consider an appeal under Article  8  ECHR,  but  concluded  that  it
    failed for reasons fully set out.

5.   This appeal has focused  on  the  judge's  application  of  the  staged
    proportionality assessment prescribed  in  R  (on  the  application  of
    Razgar) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2004]  UKHL  27.
    There is no criticism of the basic approach of  the  judge  in  dealing
    first with the best interests of  the  children  before  proceeding  to
    consider the effect of the statutory public interest factors as set out
    in Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

6.   At the core of the appeal is  Mr  Eaton's  submission  that  the  judge
    misstated relevant parts of  the  evidence  and,  in  consequence,  the
    proportionality exercise as further described  in  EV  (Philippines)  &
    Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874
    was flawed.  Mr Eaton referred  me  to  paragraph  36  of  the  judge's
    decision which reads:

         "In my judgment this is not a case where there is no  provision  to
         assist with [AND]'s needs in the Philippines although it  may  well
         be the case that that provision  would  not  be  as  developed  and
         sophisticated as  she  currently  enjoys  in  the  United  Kingdom.
         Furthermore, and for the reasons which I have previously  given,  I
         am not satisfied that this family would have no source of financial
         support in the Philippines the reasons for which I have endeavoured
         to explain in the paragraphs above.  While one cannot fail to  have
         sympathy for the appellant and her husband in trying to  deal  with
         their daughter's condition the public purse in the United  Kingdom,
         in the  guise  of  the  National  Health  Service,  cannot,  in  my
         judgment, be expected to fund  every  seriously  ill  child  on  an
         indefinite basis for the future, which seems to  me  would  be  the
         case in this appeal, when the parents  of  the  child  have  always
         known that they had no legitimate expectation to  be  permitted  to
         remain beyond the time limits of the  period  of  leave  which  was
         initially granted and which they recognised as such.   Furthermore,
         the fact that they have continued to reside  in  this  country  for
         almost three years beyond the end of that period of leave makes  no
         significant difference to that assessment.  In my judgment the same
         argument must apply to educating the children for the future."


7.   Mr Eaton submits that the judge has not properly recall or  record  the
    evidence which was before him. He drew my particular attention  to  the
    fact that schooling in the Philippines would have a cost of �20,000 per
    year, putting it beyond the reach of the family.  This information  was
    before the judge at page HH1 of the bundle.  It  would  seem  that  the
    costs of the special school requirements in the  Philippines  would  be
    unaffordable, even taking into account the financial  assistance  which
    the judge assumed would continue to come from  family  members  in  the
    United Kingdom. The cost of the schooling would be in addition  to  the
    cost of any  medical  which,  Mr  Eaton  submitted,  was  not  in  fact
    realistically available.

8.   At page L4 in the bundle was an extract from the witness  statement  of
    the first appellant. Mr Eaton took me to paragraphs 30 and 31 in  which
    it was stated:

         "30.     It would be  very  difficult  for  us  to  return  to  the
             Philippines especially that [AND] needs  a  lot  of  care  and
             attention for her health.  [AND]'s  underlying  diagnosis  and
             health  condition  is  complicated  although  the  Philippines
             health system is similar and comparative with the  UK  [AND]'s
             condition may not likely to be met due to lack  of  facilities
             for her specific diagnosis.


         31.   As  such  her  diagnosis  cannot  be  even  tested   in   the
             Philippines. [AND] was diagnosed in the  Philippines  but  her
             definitive diagnosis was not confirmed as the laboratory  test
             needed to diagnose her condition is available  locally.   They
             even referred us to go to Australia for further testing."

9.   Mr Eaton submitted that this evidence was not dealt with by  the  judge
    in his proportionality assessment at paragraph 36. I  do  not  consider
    there to be any merit in  this  criticism,  as  these  paragraphs  were
    quoted verbatim by the judge in paragraph 17 of  the  decision  in  his
    summary of the first appellant's evidence. The judge clearly had  those
    matters in mind.

10.  Mr Eaton also submitted (i) that the judge was wrongly highlighted  not
    the best interests of [AND] but those of the National  Health  Service;
    and (ii) that he did not give sufficient regard to the  fact  that  the
    appellants were not over-stayers, having made the application prior  to
    the expiration to their existing leave.. I do not  consider  either  of
    these criticism to be justified. The judge's remark on the exposure  of
    the NHS was a proper comment, and not dispositive of  the  appeal;  and
    his observation in paragraph 34 that the appellant's immigration status
    was precarious was self-evidently correct.

11.  Whilst at paragraph 37 the judge quoted extensively Lewison  J  in  the
    Court  of  Appeal's  decision  in  EV  (Philippines),   two   pertinent
    paragraphs of the principal judgment of  Christopher  Clarke  LJ  (with
    which Lewison LJ concurred) are not referred to. They read:

         "35. A decision as to what is in the  best  interests  of  children
             will depend on a number of factors such as (a) their age;  (b)
             the length of time that they have been here; (c) how long they
             have been in education; (c) what  stage  their  education  has
             reached; (d) to what extent they have  become  distanced  from
             the country to which it is proposed that they return; (e)  how
             renewable their connection with it may be; (f) to what  extent
             they will have linguistic, medical or  other  difficulties  in
             adapting to life in that country; and (g) the extent to  which
             the course proposed will interfere with their family  life  or
             their rights (if they have any) as British citizens.


         36.  In a sense the tribunal is  concerned  with  how  emphatic  an
             answer falls to be given to the question: is it  in  the  best
             interests of the child to remain? The  longer  the  child  has
             been here, the more advanced (or critical) the  stage  of  his
             education, the looser his ties with the country  in  question,
             and the more deleterious the consequences of his  return,  the
             greater the weight that falls into one side of the scales.  If
             it is overwhelmingly in the child's  best  interests  that  he
             should not return, the need to  maintain  immigration  control
             may well not tip the balance. By contrast  if  it  is  in  the
             child's best interests to remain, but only  on  balance  (with
             some factors pointing the other way), the result  may  be  the
             opposite.


         37.  In the balance on the other side there falls to be taken  into
             account the strong weight to be given to the need to  maintain
             immigration control in pursuit of the economic  well-being  of
             the country and the fact that, ex  hypothesi,  the  applicants
             have no entitlement to remain. The immigration history of  the
             parents may also be relevant e.g. if they are overstayers,  or
             have acted deceitfully." (emphasis added)

12.  The appellant's case, as advanced by Mr Eaton in this appeal,  is  that
    the judge made an error of law in his application of EV  (Philippines).
    It is said that he should have concluded, on a proper  reading  of  the
    evidence, that in this instance it was overwhelmingly in  [AND]'s  best
    interests not to return and in  those  circumstances  far  less  weight
    should have been  accorded  to  maintaining  immigration  control.  The
    judge's  alleged  misapprehension  concerning  the  evidence   of   the
    affordability of special schooling and medical care  (discussed  above)
    is folded into this substantive ground of appeal.

13.  The judge's decision is a lengthy and detailed one. He has  dealt  very
    fully in the discussion of the appeal under the Immigration Rules  with
    whether there would be very significant obstacles to the  reintegration
    of the family unit in the Philippines.  It was not necessary for him to
    repeat in a later  part  of  his  decision  those  factors  which  were
    identified at an earlier stage.

14.  The judge clearly had a full understanding of the facts  of  this  case
    and there was no requirement  to  mention  each  and  every  matter  of
    evidence. The judge was entitled to make the assessment which he did as
    to the relative provision of education and healthcare  as  between  the
    United Kingdom and the Philippines.  The judge came to  the  conclusion
    at the end of paragraph 31 that the  best  interests  of  the  children
    would be to remain in the care of their parents  and  residing  in  the
    United Kingdom, but resolved the proportionality exercise at  paragraph
    38 in giving greater weight to the  public  interest  in  removing  the
    family. This conclusion was open to him.

15.  However, and not without some hesitation, I am narrowly persuaded  that
    the judge may not have given anxious scrutiny to the matter.  I  cannot
    rule out the possibility that he misunderstood the evidence as  to  the
    affordability of special schooling and  medical  care  which  might  be
    available to [AND] in the Philippines.  That  being  so,  I  cannot  be
    confident that  the  judge  correctly  applied  the  nuanced  balancing
    exercise prescribed by Christopher Clarke LJ in  the  passage  from  EV
    (Philippines) quoted above.

16.  In the circumstances the proper course is to allow the appeal  and  set
    aside the First-tier Tribunal's  determination  under  Article  8.  All
    other findings will be preserved. The decision on human  rights  ground
    will be remade and the matter will be retained in the  Upper  Tribunal,
    ideally to be listed before me if I am available. Out of  an  abundance
    of caution I will list the matter for a full day  and  make  directions
    for the service of evidence. But the parents should not assume that the
    outcome will necessarily be different when the decision on Article 8 is
    remade: a decision will be made in the  merits  having  regard  to  all
    available evidence.
