This determination relating to the balancing exercise under  Article  8  has
been made reportable for its consideration of Shala, in the context  of  the
Home Office's 7 year concession policy for young children.



                         DETERMINATION  AND REASONS


  1. The Appellant, a citizen of Kenya, appeals,  with  leave,  against  the
     determination of an Adjudicator, Mrs S M Thew,  dismissing  her  appeal
     against the decision of the Respondent on 16 November 2001 to refuse to
     vary leave to enter or remain and refuse asylum

  2. Ms S Osman represented the Appellant. Mr  G  Phillips,  a  Home  Office
     Presenting Officer, represented the Respondent.

  3. Permission to appeal has been granted only in respect of the  rejection
     by the Adjudicator of the Appellant's Article 8 claim on the basis that
     the Tribunal should review the Adjudicator's balancing exercise in  the
     light of the observations of the Court of Appeal in Shala  where  there
     has been a substantial delay by the Home Office.

  4. There is no dispute  that  the  Adjudicator  correctly  summarised  the
     relevant facts relating to the Article 8 claim in paragraphs  30-32  of
     the determination. They show that the Appellant came to  the  UK  on  4
     November 1995 with her young daughter on a valid  visitor's  visa.  She
     has a sister living  in  UK.   The  Appellant  is  estranged  from  her
     daughter's father who remains in Kenya. The Appellant claimed asylum on
     17 January 1996. However she was not interviewed  until  2001  and,  as
     stated above, her asylum appeal was not refused until 16 November 2001,
     by which time she and her daughter had been in  the  UK  for  some  six
     years.  By  the  time  the  appeal  came  to  the  hearing  before  the
     Adjudicator on 20 May 2003, they had been in the UK for  a  further  18
     months, making 7ï¿½ years in all. In that time  they  had  established  a
     substantial private and family life in the UK.  The  Appellant  was  by
     then aged 32 and her daughter was 11, having spent  only  the  first  4
     years of  her  life  in  Kenya.  The  Appellant  has  some  educational
     qualifications and is an experienced beauty therapist, though there  is
     no evidence that there would be a lack of employment  opportunities  in
     her country.  The Appellant was very  concerned  about  her  daughter's
     education and about political unrest  in  Kenya  and  a  difference  in
     social values and lifestyle there.  She said  that  it  would  be  very
     difficult for daughter to adjust, and she herself would have nowhere to
     go to on return.  She said that it was no fault of hers that had  taken
     so long to call her for interview and reach decision on her appeal.  It
     should be mentioned that  the  Appellant  represented  herself  at  the
     hearing before the Adjudicator.

  5. The Adjudicator's conclusions, having correctly directed herself to the
     need to pay due deference to the  necessity  of  maintaining  effective
     immigration controls and to the guidance of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
     Mahmood, are set out in paragraph 32 of the determination as follows.
           "I find that whilst there would inevitably be some disruption to
           her daughter's education, that is not an insurmountable obstacle
           to the Appellant and her daughter living together in Kenya.   It
           may not be the education that the Appellant would  ideally  wish
           for her daughter to have, but the  CIPU  report  shows  that  an
           education would be available for her daughter and I bear in mind
           that the Appellant herself obtained  educational  qualifications
           in her own country. Weighing all the  factors,  I  do  not  find
           there is any insurmountable obstacle to the  Appellant  and  her
           daughter returning to Kenya and having a family life  there.   I
           conclude that her removal would not be disproportionate  in  the
           light of  all  the  circumstances  brought  before  me  and  the
           interference with her family rights would be justified."

  6. In Razgar [2003] EWCA  Civ  840,  the  Court  of  Appeal  assessed  the
     balancing exercise under Article 8 in the following terms.
           36. But what is  the  position  in  relation  to  the  balancing
           exercise called for by Article 8(2)?
           39. We recognise that if the Adjudicator finds the facts  to  be
           essentially the same as those which  formed  the  basis  of  the
           Secretary of State's decision, there will be  no  difficulty  in
           adopting the approach enunciated by Moses J. and Simon Brown  LJ


                 "Where the essential facts are not in doubt or dispute  the
                 Adjudicator's task on a human rights appeal  under  section
                 65 is to determine whether the decision  under  appeal  was
                 properly one within the decision maker's  discretion,  i.e.
                 was  a  decision  which  could   reasonably   regarded   as
                 proportionate and  striking  a  fair  balance  between  the
                 competing  interests  in  play.   If  it  was,   then   the
                 Adjudicator cannot characterise it as a  decision  "not  in
                 accordance with the law" and  so,  even  if  he  personally
                 would have preferred the balance to be struck  differently,
                 he cannot substitute his preference  for  the  decision  in
                 fact taken."


           40. But what if the Adjudicator finds the facts to be materially
           different. It would remain open to  the  Adjudicator  to  decide
           that the conclusion reached by the Secretary of State was lawful
           (and did not breach the claimant's human rights) because it  was
           in fact a proportionate response even on the facts as determined
           by the Adjudicator.
           41. Where the essential facts found by the  Adjudicator  are  so
           fundamentally different from those determined by  the  Secretary
           of State as substantially to undermine the factual basis of  the
           balancing exercise performed by him, it may  be  impossible  for
           the  Adjudicator  to   determine   whether   the   decision   is
           proportionate or otherwise than by carrying  out  the  balancing
           exercise himself.  Even in such a case when it comes to deciding
           how much  weight  to  give  to  the  policy  of  maintaining  an
           effective immigration policy, the Adjudicator  should  pay  very
           careful deference to the view of the Secretary of  State  as  to
           the importance of maintaining such a policy.  There is obviously
           a conceptual deference between (a) deciding whether the decision
           of the Secretary of State was within  the  range  of  reasonable
           responses,  and  (b)   deciding   whether   the   decision   was
           proportionate (paying deference to the Secretary of State so far
           as is possible).  We hold that the correct approach  is  (a)  in
           all cases except where this is impossible  because  the  factual
           basis of the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  has  been
           substantially undermined by the  findings  of  the  Adjudicator.
           Where (a) is impossible, then the correct approach is  (b).  But
           we  doubt  whether  in  practice  the  application  of  the  two
           approaches will often lead to different outcomes

  7. In this appeal, the  Article  8  claim  was  never  considered  by  the
     Respondent and therefore  the  Adjudicator  was  properly  entitled  to
     undertake her own balancing exercise.  However  in  so  doing,  and  in
     deciding  how  much  weight  to  attach  to  maintaining  an  effective
     immigration policy, she had  to  pay  very  careful  deference  to  the
     expressed views of the  Respondent.  For  its  part,  the  Tribunal  is
     constrained from interfering with the Adjudicator's  asessment  by  the
     guidance of the Court of Appeal in Oleed, and can only do  so  if  they
     are plainly wrong or unsustainable.

  8. Ms Osman has submitted that the Adjudicator's conclusion at the end  of
     her balancing exercise is plainly wrong and unsustainable  because  she
     failed to take into account the guidance given by the Court  of  Appeal
     in Shala [2003] EWCA Civ 233,  concerning  the  impact  of  substantial
     delay by the Home Office in reaching its decision in the light  of  its
     published policies.

  9.  We  should  say  at  once  that  Shala  relates  to   very   different
     circumstances  to  this  appeal.   We   are   frequently   invited   by
     representatives to extend its scope with the implication that we should
     punish the Respondent for delay in decision making by adding  delay  in
     itself to the  factors  in  favour  of  a  claimant  in  the  balancing
     exercise. We do not  agree,  as  that  is  not  what  Shala  says.  The
     principles described in Shala are narrow in scope and we should be very
     cautious about applying them to other situations, as  indeed  Schiemann
     LJ was, as can be seen in the passage from his judgement  that  we  set
     out below.

 10. In Shala, the claimant came from Kosovo during  the  conflict  in  that
     country when the Respondent's policy was to grant leave to claimants of
     Albanian ethnicity.  There was however a four year delay in reaching  a
     conclusion about his asylum application by which time the conflict  was
     over and the policy had lapsed.  During  this  time  the  claimant  had
     married.  If he had been granted leave  to  remain  in  line  with  the
     Respondent's published policy, he would have had an in-country right to
     make a marriage application under the Immigration Rules. However  as  a
     consequence of the Home Office delay, he did not  have  an  in  country
     right of appeal and in accordance with the guidance  of  the  Court  of
     Appeal in Mahmood concerning queue jumping, would  have  to  return  to
     Kosovo in order to make an application under the Immigration Rules from
     there. The Court of Appeal in Shala however made the  following  points
     in the context of the Article 8 assessment in respect of family life.
           16. But the whole balancing exercise was conducted  without  any
           weight being attached to the fact that the policy being put into
           one side of the scales would not have been applicable at all but
           for the delay on the part of the Home Office.  While it  may  be
           uncertain when the  Appellant  would  more  normally  have  been
           granted refugee status or exceptional leave  to  remain,  it  is
           unfair that he should have to suffer because of  an  uncertainty
           arising from the Home Office's failings.  Nor can be  said  that
           allowing him to  apply  in-country  would  encourage  others  to
           exploit the established procedures.  To  require  the  Appellant
           now to leave the United Kingdom and to  apply  from  Kosovo  for
           leave to enter seems to me to be clearly disproportionate and to
           fall outside the generous margin of discretion to be afforded in
           such cases to the  Respondent,  and  does  not  appear  to  have
           reflected  adequately,  if  at  all,  the  significance  of  his
           department's delay in the present case."

 11. As we have said the facts in this present appeal are  quite  different.
     There is no marriage application and  queue  jumping  does  not  arise.
     However the Home Office has had a long-standing and  well-known  policy
     relating to removal where there are children with long residence in the
     UK. It is known as the seven-year concession. It states that
           "Whilst it is  important  that  each  individual  case  must  be
           considered on its merits, there are specific factors  which  are
           likely to be of particular relevance  when  considering  whether
           enforcement  action  should  proceed  or  be  initiated  against
           parents who have children who  have  lengthy  residence  in  the
           United Kingdom.  For the purpose of proceeding with  enforcement
           action in a case involving a child, the general  presumption  is
           that we would not usually proceed  with  enforcement  action  in
           cases  where  a  child  was  born  here  and  has   lived   here
           continuously to the age of seven or over, or where  having  come
           to the United Kingdom at an  early  age  they  have  accumulated
           seven years or more continuous residence.  However there may  be
           circumstances in which it is considered that enforcement  action
           is still appropriate despite the lengthy residence of the child,
           for example in cases where the parents have a particularly  poor
           immigration history  and  have  deliberately  seriously  delayed
           consideration of their case.  In all cases the following factors
           are relevant in  reaching  a  judgment  on  whether  enforcement
           action should proceed.
            - the length of the parents' residence without  leave;  whether
              removal  has  been  delayed  through  protracted  and   often
              repetitive representations or by the parents going to ground;
            - the age of the children;
            - whether the children were conceived at a time when either  of
              the parents had leave to remain;
            - whether return to the parents country of origin  would  cause
              extreme  hardship  for  the  children  or  put  their  health
              seriously at risk;
            - whether either of the  parents  has  a  history  of  criminal
              behaviour or deception.

 12. It was conceded by  Mr  Phillips  that  none  of  the  adverse  factors
     described in this published concession applied in the  present  appeal.
     The Appellant has a blameless character and has not sought to delay her
     appeal in any way.  The delay is entirely  the  responsibility  of  the
     Home Office. It follows therefore, as the Appellant's daughter came  to
     the UK at a young age and was 11 by the time of the hearing before  the
     Adjudicator, as the direct consequence of the delay in decision  making
     by the Respondent, that she fell within the scope of this policy and as
     a consequence there was a general presumption that the Respondent would
     not usually proceed with enforcement action against them.

 13. Ms Osman submitted that this was a material factor that the Adjudicator
     should have weighed in the balancing exercise. The Adjudicator did  not
     consider this matter and as a consequence her  balancing  exercise  was
     unsustainable.

 14. Mr Phillips asserted that the policy was a concession, which was at the
     disposal of the Respondent and could not be applied by the Adjudicator.
     However he acknowledged that the published policy of the Respondent was
     a factor, which should properly be taken into account in the  balancing
     exercise under Article 8 and, with his customary fairness, acknowledged
     that he was in difficulties in making any further submissions  in  this
     regard.

 15. We conclude that the Adjudicator, when assessing the weight to be given
     to the Respondent's policy, should have taken  into  account  the  fact
     that his own policy was a general presumption that  enforcement  action
     would not be taken in cases of this kind. We should stress that this is
     not a factor to be added  to  those  in  favour  of  the  Appellant  by
     reference to the established factors in her private and family life. It
     is a matter that relates to  the  other  side  of  the  scales  in  the
     balancing exercise, ie establishing what the policy of  the  Respondent
     actually is on the facts of this appeal. The Adjudicator was plainly in
     error in failing  to  take  this  into  account  and  consequently  her
     balancing exercise must be set aside.  However the Adjudicator properly
     recorded all the relevant facts as we have described above and  we  are
     able to make our own balancing exercise on that basis.

 16. For the reasons described above, we  conclude,  in  the  light  of  the
     Respondent's own seven-year concession and the fact that  none  of  the
     adverse factors in  that  policy  apply  to  the  Appellant,  that  the
     Respondent's policy  of  maintaining  fair  and  effective  immigration
     control does not in fact require the removal of the Appellant  and  her
     daughter, and would not be undermined by allowing  them  to  remain  in
     this country.  Indeed, her remaining in this country with her  daughter
     would appear to be in line with the Respondent's own published  policy.



 17. In those circumstances, given the substantial private and  family  life
     that has been developed by the Appellant and her daughter, who have now
     been  in  the  UK  for  some  8  years,  we  hold  that  it  would   be
     disproportionate under Article 8 to remove them.

 18. Accordingly for the reasons given  above  this  appeal  is  allowed  in
     respect of Article 8 only.
