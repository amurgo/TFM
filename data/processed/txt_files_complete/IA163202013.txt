                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. We have completed the remaking of the decision under appeal.  Prior to
      doing so we gave our reasons at an earlier  stage  today  for  setting
      aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and embarking  upon  the
      remaking exercise.  As we said earlier we decided  to  set  aside  the
      decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  ground  of  procedural
      unfairness.  In short, the Judge investigated and determined an  issue
      of considerable importance in circumstances where  the  Appellant  was
      not put on notice.

   2. The issue in question, which was whether Appellant's spouse  had  ever
      exercised  Treaty  rights,  was,  for  the  Judge,  one  of   decisive
      importance.   It  followed,  therefore,  in  our  judgement  that  the
      Appellant had been deprived of a fair hearing at first  instance.   To
      this we add that the Judge, having  adopted  that  course,  failed  to
      engage with the Secretary of State's  letter  of  decision.   For  the
      first of those reasons, fundamentally, we concluded that the Appellant
      had been deprived of a fair hearing and, accordingly, we set aside the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

   3.     The appeal has proceeded on two grounds.  The first  is  based  on
      the Immigration European Economic Area Regulations 2006.  We  conclude
      that it fails on this ground  for  the  reason  that  the  Appellant's
      spouse does not fall within the definition of "EEA  national"  in  the
      amended Regulation 2, it being common case that this amendment applied
      to the Appellant's application to the Secretary  of  State.   We  also
      agree with the Judge that the application under the Regulations had to
      fail on the independent ground that there was  no  evidence  that  the
      Appellant's spouse had been exercising Treaty rights.  That,  however,
      is  secondary  to  the  fundamental  and  incurable  frailty  in   the
      application to which I have just adverted.

   4.     The second ground on which the appeal proceeds is that of  Article
      8 of the Convention.  The procedural route here is noteworthy.   While
      the original application  to  the  Secretary  of  State  had  included
      Article 8, the decision maker declined to address this ground at  all.
      The reasons for that are not entirely clear.  In any  event,  that  is
      how the decision was made. The  Judge  at  first  instance  adopted  a
      somewhat different course.  First  of  all,  she  concluded  that  the
      Appellant had failed to establish an Article 8 case under  the  Rules.
      The Judge then proceeded to consider the Appellant's  Article  8  case
      out  with  the  Rules.   Continuing,  the  Judge  pronounced   herself
      satisfied that the impugned decision interfered with  the  Appellant's
      family life in the United Kingdom.  Proceeding to the next  step,  she
      further pronounced herself satisfied  that  the  interference  was  in
      accordance with the law.

   5.     The Judge then identified the legitimate aim  of  the  maintenance
      and promotion of effective immigration  control.    This  brought  the
      Judge to a further stage in the exercise.  The Judge's conclusion  was
      that there was a marked insufficiency of information.   This  impelled
      her to conclude  that  the  Appellant's  Article  8  case  must  fail.
      Notably, the Judge did not couch this conclusion in  the  language  of
      proportionality or otherwise.  The net result is that the reasons  for
      rejecting the Article 8 case at first  instance  do  not  emerge  with
      clarity from the Judgement.

   6.     This Tribunal, in remaking the decision, has been  fully  equipped
      with a broad spectrum of evidence bearing  on  the  Article  8  claim.
      Both  parties  are  agreed  that  the  central  question  is  that  of
      proportionality.  In  the  proportionality  equation  there  are  some
      factors adverse  to  the  Appellant  personally.   The  first  is  his
      immigration  history,  which  is  very  unsatisfactory.   The   second
      concerns his wife's knowledge of his illegal immigrant status  in  the
      United Kingdom.  The third concerns the  misrepresentations  which  he
      made to the Registrar of Births when the Certificates of Birth of  the
      children of the partnership were being composed and registered.  These
      misrepresentations concerned the Appellant's place of  birth  and  his
      regular place of residence.

   7.     At this juncture, it is appropriate to highlight that the Judge at
      first instance did not consider the family life of anyone  other  than
      the Appellant.  Ultimately, before this Tribunal, Miss Kiss (on behalf
      of the Secretary of State), whilst correctly highlighting some of  the
      negative factors in the Article 8  equation,  has  conceded  that  the
      impugned  decision  is  disproportionate.   That  concession  is  very
      properly made.  It  is  based  on  the  predictive  reality  that  the
      impugned decision will have an enormous negative impact on the  family
      life of the five members of the family unit concerned.  Realistically,
      it will mean separation of the father from all the  other  members  of
      the family, who include three children  who  are  aged  9,  7  and  5ï¿½
      respectively, in circumstances where they are EU citizens and  British
      nationals and they with their  mother  will  as  a  matter  of  strong
      probability continue their  lives  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  their
      father's absence.  There will be no real family life at  all  if  this
      decision is  maintained.   We  also  highlight  the  duration  of  the
      mother/father relationship, its obvious sustainability and  durability
      and the key role which the Appellant plays in the family life  of  all
      concerned.  He has become a primary carer of the children  and  has  a
      dominant role in their lives.   Destruction of this family unit  would
      not further the public interest.

   8.     There are other factors to which we could refer but  which  it  is
      unnecessary to highlight in the circumstances.   We  repeat  that  the
      concession on behalf of the Secretary of State has been properly made.
       Accordingly, in the remaking of this decision we have  no  hesitation
      in allowing the appeal under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.
       Thus the appeal succeeds.
