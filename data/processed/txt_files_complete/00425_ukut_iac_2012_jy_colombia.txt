1.  The requirement to show that a person or persons can be  maintained  (or
will maintain themselves) "adequately" without recourse to public funds  has
long been a requirement of the immigration  rules.  It  continues  to  be  a
requirement for various
categories of person in the amended rules  that  came  into  force  in  July
2012. In order to establish that maintenance is "adequate" under  the  rules
as in force before 9  July  2012,  an  applicant  needs  to  show  that  the
resources available will meet or exceed the relevant  income  support  level
set by the United Kingdom government (KA (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT  00065).  A
similar requirement is to be found in  the  definitions  of  "adequate"  and
"adequately" in paragraph 6 of the rules as amended in July 2012.

2. In calculating the level of resources  that  will  be  available  to  the
applicant  and  any  relevant   family   members,   after   the   claimant's
hypothetical arrival in the United Kingdom, it may be necessary to  consider
the effect on such a member's  entitlement  to  benefits  of  income  and/or
capital.

3.  Income support is a means-tested benefit. The general rule is  that  all
income, including that from other social security benefits, is to  be  taken
into  account  when  calculating  an  individual's  entitlement  to   income
support, unless a specific "disregard" applies. A list of disregards  is  to
be found in Schedule 9 to the Income  Support  (General)  Regulations  1987.
They  include  "voluntary  payments".  For  the   purposes   of   the   1987
Regulations, a voluntary payment is a payment  by  a  third  party,  without
anything being obtained in return, tangible  or  otherwise  (R  v  Doncaster
Borough Council ex parte Boulton [1993] 25 HLR 195; R(H) 5/05).

4.  Access to capital may have  an  effect  upon  a  person's  means  tested
benefits, provided that the person concerned has a  beneficial  interest  in
the capital. At present, a person is not entitled to income  support  if  he
or she has such an interest in capital over �16,000 (regulation  45  of  the
1987 Regulations). Capital of less than �6,000 has no effect on  entitlement
to income support. Capital of  between  �6,000  and  �16,000  causes  weekly
income support to be reduced by �1 for every �250 or part  of  such  capital
(regulation 53).

5.  If a person is given money in order for it to be used for  a  particular
purpose and on condition that the money must be returned  if  not  used  for
that purpose, then the money will be regarded as  being  held  on  trust  by
that person for that purpose and, if  the  purpose  fails,  on  a  resulting
trust for the payer. It will  accordingly,  at  least  in  general,  not  be
treated as the person's capital, since he or she has no beneficial  interest
in it (Barclays Bank Limited v  Quistclose  Investments  Limited  [1970]  AC
567).

6.  In considering the  above  matters  in  an  immigration  appeal,  it  is
important to bear in mind (a) that the appellant carries  the  legal  burden
of  proving  that  he  or  she  meets  the  relevant  requirements  of   the
immigration rules; and (b) in the light of [19] of  Mahad  [2009]  UKSC  16,
any case that depends  for  its  success  upon  a  third  party's  voluntary
payment will need to be scrutinised with particular care. Much will turn  on
the credibility of the appellant, sponsor and third  party,  both  generally
and as to the specifics  of  the  actual  payments.  The  same  is  true  in
relation to any assertion that income paid to or capital or other sums  held
by a sponsor who is in receipt of  benefits  are  to  be  treated  as  being
subject to "Quistclose" trusts.  A  specific  decision  in  an  individual's
favour by the Department for Work and  Pensions  ("DWP")  will  normally  be
determinative, unless it  can  be  shown  the  DWP  was  materially  misled.
Conversely, the mere absence of an adverse DWP  decision  will  not  usually
take the appellant's case materially forward.

7.  Because these issues involve mixed fact and  law,  an  appellant  in  an
immigration appeal must be able  to  demonstrate,  either  that  the  actual
financial position, on arrival, will be such as to make  it  unnecessary  to
rely on benefits in order to provide a  standard  of  living  equivalent  to
that available on means tested benefits; or that the relevant law  bears  on
the circumstances of the family  in  such  a  way  that  there  will  be  no
additional recourse to public funds in so relying.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.    This is the determination of the Tribunal, to which each of the  panel
    has contributed. It concerns a respondent who is a citizen of Colombia,
    born on 7 November 1985.  He is currently resident in Spain.  Whilst in
    Gran Canaria, the respondent met a British citizen  (the  sponsor)  who
    was working there temporarily.  The parties  subsequently  married  and
    two children have been born to them.  The sponsor  and  their  children
    live in the United Kingdom.

2.    Since the birth of her children, the sponsor has not worked.   She  is
    in receipt of a number of United Kingdom state benefits.  In  2010  the
    respondent applied for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as  the
    spouse of the sponsor.  On 26 November 2010 the Entry Clearance Officer
    refused the respondent's application.  The Entry Clearance Officer took
    issue with the ability of  the  parties  to  maintain  and  accommodate
    themselves without (additional) recourse to public funds,  as  required
    by paragraph 281 of the  Immigration  Rules.   In  essence,  the  Entry
    Clearance  Officer  was  concerned  about  the   sponsor's   precarious
    financial position.

3.    The notice of decision made reference to the fact that  the  sponsor's
    mother had been making payments to the sponsor at the rate of �160  per
    week.  It is somewhat unclear from the  notice  of  decision  what,  if
    anything, the Entry Clearance Officer made of this matter.   The  Entry
    Clearance Manager, however, writing after receipt of  the  respondent's
    notice and grounds of appeal, took issue with the credibility of  these
    payments from the mother, since it was (mistakenly) thought that, on an
    annualised basis, they comprised almost the entirety  of  the  mother's
    declared salary.

4.    At the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision,  there  was  no
    requirement in the Immigration Rules for the respondent to  demonstrate
    that he had reached any objectively-set standard for conversing in  the
    English language.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  nevertheless,  was
    doubtful that the respondent's English would be such as to  enable  him
    to work in the United Kingdom.  This  was  despite  evidence  that  the
    sponsor's aunt  was  willing  and  able  to  give  the  respondent  the
    necessary training for him to  work  for  her  company  in  the  United
    Kingdom.


The proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

5.     The  respondent's  appeal  against  the  Entry  Clearance   Officer's
    decision was heard  at  Bradford  in  May  2011  by  Immigration  Judge
    Henderson.  The judge heard evidence from the sponsor and the sponsor's
    mother.

6.    At paragraph 4 of the determination, the judge  recorded  the  sponsor
    as explaining that the payments of  �160  a  week  into  her  Nat  West
    current account came from her mother, who  "was  able  to  support  her
    [with] such a large sum".  The sponsor was also asked,  "how  long  her
    family had been supporting her".  At paragraph 15, the  judge  recorded
    asking the sponsor "to clarify whether the money paid to her  from  her
    mother was as a loan or  as  a  gift".   In  paragraph  18,  the  judge
    recorded the sponsor's mother as being asked "to  confirm  whether  she
    required the repayment of money she gave to her daughter".

7.    The judge's findings and reasons were recorded at paragraphs 22 to  31
    of her determination.  At paragraph 22, the judge recorded the  sponsor
    as receiving "substantial  material  and  emotional  support  from  her
    family in this country".  At paragraph 23, no doubt bearing in mind the
    judgments of the Supreme Court in  Mahad  [2009]  UKSC  16,  the  judge
    described the main issue as  being  "whether  or  not  the  third-party
    support provided is assured, reliable and credible and was  so  at  the
    date of the decision".  The judge  was  satisfied  that  the  level  of
    income of the sponsor's mother was, in  reality,  considerably  greater
    than had been thought by the Entry Clearance Officer.  The mother  was,
    accordingly, well able to make the payments  of  �160  a  week  to  the
    sponsor.  This was before  one  took  account  of  the  fact  that  the
    sponsor's father also worked.  The couple's  joint  income  was  around
    �39,000 per annum.

8.    The judge was plainly impressed by  the  manner  and  content  of  the
    evidence of both the sponsor and her  mother.   At  paragraph  25,  the
    judge accepted that the mother "would continue to support her  daughter
    and the [respondent] for as long as necessary".  At  paragraph  26  the
    judge concluded that the mother was "in a position to provide realistic
    support at the current level for the foreseeable future".

9.    At paragraph 27, the judge turned to the  various  sources  of  income
    available.  The cost of maintaining the  respondent,  the  sponsor  and
    their child was agreed  between  the  parties  as  being  approximately
    �222.75, which included rent.   While we note that  it  was  an  agreed
    figure, the basis of calculation is not evident to us, though we accept
    that the resources of the sponsor would have been required to extend to
    the maintenance of a couple at income support levels  rather  than,  as
    previously, the sponsor as a lone parent.

10.   However, even taking  account  of  the  payment  of  �160,  the  judge
    concluded that the income of the  sponsor  from  her  various  benefits
    still fell short of the required �222.75 figure, albeit by no more than
    around �27 (it seems, a week).  At paragraph 29,  the  judge  made  two
    findings regarding this shortfall.  The first was that "the sponsor had
    [a] sum of money saved in her account at the date of the decision which
    amounted to over �6,000 [we assess it as slightly less - see  paragraph
    53 below].  This money is a gift to the couple [from  the  mother].   I
    accept that this was also to be used as third party support at the date
    of decision".  Secondly, the judge found "that the sponsor's mother was
    willing and able to provide the additional  shortfall  should  this  be
    necessary... given her own income and  her  husband's  income  and  the
    level of outgoings the couple  had  at  that  time".   The  judge  was,
    accordingly,  satisfied  that   the   maintenance   and   accommodation
    requirements of paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules had been met.

11.   So far as the respondent's  English  language  skills  and  employment
    prospects were concerned, the judge noted  at  paragraph  30  that  the
    "changes in the Immigration Rules with regard to entry clearance and an
    applicant's English knowledge came after the date of the  decision"  in
    the present case.  In any event, she was satisfied that the  respondent
    had adequate English skills, having heard evidence from the sponsor and
    the mother that he spoke good English.  There was also  an  example  in
    the form of  an  e-mail  from  the  respondent  that  demonstrated  his
    proficiency in the English language.  At paragraph 31, the judge  noted
    the evidence that the business of the  sponsor's  aunt  was  no  longer
    extant.  Although there was a second job offer this "postdates the date
    of decision in this appeal.  I  have  therefore  not  taken  this  into
    account".  Nevertheless, the judge's findings on the money available to
    the couple were such as to cause the judge to allow the appeal.


The proceedings in the Upper Tribunal

12.   The Entry Clearance Officer was granted permission to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal against the determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge.  The Entry Clearance  Officer  asserted  that  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer had raised with the judge the issue of the sponsor's
    "apparent failure to declare her  additional  income  of  approximately
    �160 per week to the relevant authorities".  The grounds  attached  the
    minute  or  record  of  the  Tribunal  proceedings,  prepared  by   the
    Presenting Officer who had appeared before the judge,  which  confirmed
    that that officer had raised the issue of the effect on  the  sponsor's
    benefits of both the income from the mother and the  sponsor's  capital
    in the form of savings.

13.   Prior to the initial hearing in the Upper Tribunal on  4  April  2012,
    the respondent's solicitors made application pursuant to rule 15(2A) of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, to  rely  upon  new
    evidence.  The evidence comprised a record from a Jobcentre Plus office
    of a telephone call the sponsor made to the  Jobcentre  on  12  October
    2011.  According to that record:

        "In the call she states that her mother  put  some  money  into  her
    bank account and that this money was recently transferred back  to  her
    mother's account, approximately �6,700.  This is the only  information.
    There are no dates for the transactions,  no  bank  statements  and  no
    letter from the customer's mother confirming the customer's  statement.
    I cannot make any kind of meaningful decision without more  information
    and/or verification.  However, if the  money  came  from  her  mother's
    account and went back to her mother's account then it seems likely that
    we would regard the customer as not being the beneficial owner  of  the
    capital whilst it was in her possession".

14.   At the hearing on 4 April, the Upper Tribunal decided  to  admit  that
    evidence, in the interests of justice.  The  Tribunal  considered  that
    the new evidence pointed to the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  as  having
    erred in law, in failing  to  deal  with  the  matters  raised  by  the
    Presenting Officer, as evidenced in the grounds of appeal to the  Upper
    Tribunal.  In the light of the evidence from  Jobcentre  Plus,  it  was
    apparent that, had the judge dealt  with  the  matter,  she  would  not
    inevitably have concluded that the so-called  savings  of  the  sponsor
    were available to her, for the purposes  of  maintaining  her  and  the
    respondent, since the evidence indicated  that  the  savings  had  been
    taken out of the sponsor's bank account, and that it was apparently now
    being  asserted  that  those  savings  were  never  in  the   sponsor's
    beneficial ownership.

15.   On 4 April, the Upper Tribunal set  aside  the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, with the result that the decision  in  the  appeal
    fell to be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.  Although the record of  what
    the judge was told by the  witnesses  at  the  Bradford  hearing  would
    remain, the Upper Tribunal envisaged that it would be necessary to hear
    oral evidence from the sponsor and her mother, in order  to  reach  its
    own views on credibility.

16.   The Upper Tribunal gave  directions,  including  that  the  respondent
    should serve a comprehensive statement of the  various  benefits  which
    the sponsor was receiving at the  date  of  the  decision  and  of  all
    relevant statutory provisions regarding the effect, if  any,  on  those
    benefits of (a) payments of income to the sponsor by third parties; and
    (b) savings held by the sponsor.  The parties  were  also  directed  to
    prepare for the resumed hearing on the basis that it might be heard  by
    a senior panel, including  a  judge  from  the  Administrative  Appeals
    Chamber of the Upper Tribunal.

17.   Such a panel was, in fact, convened for  the  resumed  hearing,  which
    took place on 19 June 2012.

18.   The  sponsor  gave  evidence.   She  confirmed  as  true  her  written
    statement of 1 June 2012.  In this, the sponsor confirmed that  at  the
    date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision she was  in  receipt  of
    income support of �61.08 per week; child benefit of  �20.30  per  week;
    and child tax credit of �55.39 per week.

19.   Before the respondent made the application for  entry  clearance,  the
    sponsor's  mother  offered  to  help  the  sponsor.   Having  consulted
    solicitors, the sponsor was advised that she needed to  have  money  to
    show that she could support the respondent if he  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom.  When the sponsor told the  solicitor  that  her  parents  had
    spare money and would be happy to help, it was decided that �160 a week
    would be put into the sponsor's current  account,  with  the  intention
    that this would be used "by my husband or for my husband".  The sponsor
    contended that there was "never an intention that I would use the money
    for me and my children".  It was put into her current account  to  show
    that the  money  was  available  to  the  respondent,  as  well  as  to
    demonstrate that the sponsor's parents could spare that amount of money
    each week.

20.   The sponsor stated that her mother would have been happy to have  kept
    the money in her account and to have given that to the  sponsor  "as  a
    lump sum for my husband, or to put the money in a separate account  for
    the benefit of my husband, as she has done now.  Now my mum has  opened
    an account in her name with my husband as the second account holder and
    all the money that she gave me has been put into  that  account,  again
    this money is there for his use, if needed".

21.   The statement continued that the sponsor wished "to be clear that  the
    money that my mother gave me was not for me, it was  for  my  husband's
    use, if needed."  The people at the  Benefits  Agency  had  called  the
    sponsor recently for an interview.   They  said  that  they  had  "been
    advised by the immigration authorities that I had money from my  mother
    and then wanted to interview me with respect to this.  I told them what
    I have said in the statement and I asked my immigration  solicitors  to
    call them and confirm the same.  My solicitor wrote  a  letter  to  the
    Benefits Agency to confirm my on-going immigration case and since  that
    time, I have not heard anything further from them".

22.   The sponsor stated that if she were "to describe  the  money  that  my
    mum was putting into my account, I would say that this was a gift or  a
    wedding gift for use by my husband when he came to the United  Kingdom,
    if it was needed".  Had the sponsor known at the time that  she  needed
    to declare the money to the Benefits Agency, she would  have  done  so.
    She had, in fact, informed the Benefits Agency of  the  matter,  before
    she had been asked by them to attend the interview  "I  never  had  any
    intention of hiding this money from anyone.  If I had  intended  to  do
    so, I would not have put this into my current account".

23.   In cross-examination, the sponsor said  that,  whilst  the  money  was
    going from her mother to the sponsor's current account, she did not use
    that money in order to assist with her  own  household  expenses.   The
    change in arrangements, whereby the mother established an account  with
    the Yorkshire Bank and caused the sponsor to transfer  the  accumulated
    sum from the sponsor's account to that account, arose as  a  result  of
    advice received,  following  the  grant  of  permission  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

24.   In answer to a question from  the  Tribunal,  the  sponsor  said  that
    there might have been occasions when a small element of the �160 a week
    had been used by her, to cover shortfalls for a few  days,  before  the
    sponsor's benefits were received, but the  shortfall  would  always  be
    repaid.  The sponsor's bank statements confirmed that this  had  indeed
    occurred, but the amounts had been  very  small,  as  had  the  periods
    involved.  The  sponsor  treated  it  as  a  form  of  very  short-term
    borrowing.  There had been no discussion between  her  and  her  mother
    about what would happen to the accumulated sum  if,  in  the  end,  the
    respondent were  to  be  unsuccessful  in  his  application  for  entry
    clearance.

25.   The sponsor's  mother  gave  evidence.   She  confirmed  as  true  and
    adopted her written statement of 13 May  2012.   In  this,  the  mother
    explained how the sponsor had been advised by her  solicitor  that  she
    would either need to be working or would need  financial  support  from
    her family.  The mother confirmed that she would be willing to help her
    daughter.  After considering her financial position,  the  mother  said
    that she could spare �160 a week.  If more had been needed, the  mother
    would have been able to do this with the agreement of her husband.   So
    as to demonstrate her ability to provide the relevant money, the mother
    paid this into the sponsor's account on a weekly basis.  The  intention
    for the money was that it would be used by [the respondent] or for [the
    respondent] and not [the sponsor] as she was on benefits  and  she  had
    enough money for herself....  I would have been happy to keep the money
    in my account or to give this to [the sponsor] as a lump sum  for  [the
    respondent] or to put the money in a separate account for  the  benefit
    of [the respondent]".  The  statement  went  on  to  confirm  what  had
    happened following the grant  of  permission  to  the  Upper  Tribunal;
    namely, that the money was removed from the sponsor's  current  account
    and placed in a Yorkshire Bank account in the names of the  mother  and
    of the respondent.

26.   Cross-examined, the mother  said  that  the  arrangement  in  question
    started in 2010.  In answer to a question from the Tribunal, the mother
    said that she regarded the money from the very start as a gift for  the
    respondent, not for her daughter.  They had been  advised  to  put  the
    money, initially, in the sponsor's own bank account.   The  mother  did
    not view the money as being her own money any  longer.   They  had  not
    used an income bearing account because the solicitor  had  not  advised
    this.  When they had been told by their solicitor that the money in the
    sponsor's account  was  causing  a  problem  regarding  the  visa,  the
    decision was taken to move the money to  the  Yorkshire  Bank  account.
    There was no question of the  sponsor  using  the  money  for  her  own
    purposes, such as to buy a car. If the sponsor had  needed  things  for
    the children which she could not obtain using her benefits, the  mother
    would have been prepared to help further, as a separate exercise.


Discussion

27.   The requirement to show that a person or  persons  can  be  maintained
    (or will maintain themselves) "adequately" without recourse  to  public
    funds has long been a feature of the immigration rules. It continues to
    be a requirement for various categories of person, in the amended rules
    that came into force on 9 July 2012 (but see esp. Appendix  FM  (family
    members) and Appendix FM-SE (family members - specified evidence)). The
    former version of the rules applies to the  present  appeal  and  those
    others where the decision concerned was made before 9 July. In order to
    establish  that  maintenance  is  "adequate"  under  those  rules,   an
    applicant needs to show that  the  resources  available  will  meet  or
    exceed the relevant income support level  set  by  the  United  Kingdom
    government ("the target  figure").  This  finding  of  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration Tribunal in KA  (Pakistan)  [2006]  UKAIT  00065  has  been
    approved by the Court of Appeal in AM v Entry Clearance Officer  [2008]
    EWCA Civ 1082 (a finding unaffected by the  subsequent  appeal  to  the
    Supreme Court) and French v Entry Clearance Officer  (Kingston)  [2011]
    EWCA Civ 35 (the KA  principle  is  reflected  in  the  definitions  of
    "adequate" and "adequately" in the July 2012 rules). If  the  applicant
    is intending to live with a spouse or partner in  the  United  Kingdom,
    the income support level that he or she must meet will be such level as
    has been set by the government in respect of the couple. Where children
    are included, the target figure  will  be  increased  by  the  relevant
    figure or figures for each dependent child.

28.    KA (Pakistan) establishes that the target figure  is  an  "objective"
    one. It is therefore immaterial that the applicant and/or any  relevant
    family, as just described, can be shown to be more likely than  not  to
    live on less than that figure.

29.   The present case requires an examination of the  effect,  if  any,  of
    the arrival of an  applicant  for  entry  clearance  upon  a  sponsor's
    entitlement to certain benefits  and,  thus,  on  the  ability  of  the
    applicant to demonstrate there are available resources at or above  the
    target figure.  It particularly raises questions about  the  effect  of
    (a) payments from a third party; and (b) capital sums.  In  determining
    an immigration appeal, involving whether a  person  can  be  maintained
    and/or accommodated without additional recourse to public funds (within
    the meaning of paragraphs 6 and 6A to C of the immigration  rules:  see
    the Schedule to this determination), it will often be  vital  that  the
    judicial  fact-finder  determines   the   relationship   between   such
    payments/capital and the sponsor's entitlement to  benefits,  once  the
    applicant has hypothetically arrived. Only  by  establishing  this  can
    proper findings be made as to the  actual  financial  position  of  the
    individuals concerned.

30.   In determining these matters, we had the benefit of a written  opinion
    from Desmond Rutledge, Counsel specialising in benefits  law.   Despite
    the way in which this document was presented to us, we do not treat  it
    as expert evidence, since it concerns United  Kingdom,  as  opposed  to
    foreign, law.  Instead, we have,  in  effect,  treated  it  as  a  very
    helpful extension of Mr Hussain's submissions as to the proper approach
    to be taken in cases of this kind.


(1)  The relevant rules on income

31.   Income support is  a  means-tested  benefit.   The  decisions  of  the
    Department for Work and Pensions ("DWP") on  questions  of  income  and
    capital  for  the  purposes  of  income  support  are   almost   always
    determinative of those questions for other benefits the individual  may
    be receiving, such as housing benefit, council tax  benefit  and  child
    tax credit.   Section 136(1) of the Social Security  Contributions  and
    Benefits Act 1992 ("the SSCBA 1992") provides that income  and  capital
    should  be  calculated  or  estimated  in  such  a  manner  as  may  be
    prescribed.  Section 136 contains wide-ranging provisions for income to
    be treated as capital and for capital to be treated as income, each  in
    prescribed circumstances.  The "prescribing" is currently done  by  the
    Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 ("the 1987 Regulations") (see
    paragraph 40 below). These  Regulations  include  provisions  regarding
    calculation of income of  members  of  a  respondent's  family;  income
    derived from income other  than  earnings  (including  social  security
    benefits); income treated as capital; and tariff income  from  capital.
    Neither the SSCBA 1992 nor the 1987 Regulations provide any  definition
    of "income".  The general rule is that all income, including that  from
    other social security benefits,  is  to  be  taken  into  account  when
    calculating an individual's entitlement to  income  support,  unless  a
    specific disregard applies.


(2)  "Disregards" for social security benefits

32.   The list of  "disregards"  in  Schedule  9  to  the  1987  Regulations
    provides that income from the following benefits is completely ignored:

    (a)    Child Benefit (in most situations);


    (b)    Child Tax Credits;


    (c)    Housing Benefit, and


    (d)    Council Tax Benefit.




(3) Disregards for "voluntary payments"


33.   Schedule 9 to the 1987 Regulations provides that "voluntary  payments"
    made on a regular basis to a person are to be disregarded as the income
    of that person:-

         "15(1)    Subject  to  sub-paragraph  (3)  and  paragraph  39,  any
              relevant payment made or due to be made at regular intervals.


         ...


         (5A)     In this paragraph, "relevant payment" means -


              (a)      a charitable payment;


              (b)      a voluntary payment;


              (c)      a payment (not falling within sub-paragraph  (a)  or
                  (b) above) from a trust whose funds are  derived  from  a
                  payment made in consequence of any personal injury to the
                  claimant."


34.   The expression "voluntary payment" fell to be interpreted  by  Laws  J
    in R v Doncaster Borough Council ex parte Boulton) [1993] 25  HLR  195.
    The case involved payments made  by  British  Coal  to  the  widows  of
    retired miners in lieu of  free  coal.   Laws  J  held  that  the  word
    "voluntary" is commonly used in law both as the antithesis of something
    done under compulsion and  as  denoting  the  obtaining  or  giving  of
    something without anything  being  obtained  on  return.   The  precise
    meaning the word bore in any  piece  of  legislation  depended  on  the
    context and purpose of that legislation.  In  the  context  with  which
    Laws J was concerned, it was the second of  those  two  meanings  which
    applied.  Since British Coal had entered into  the  Concessionary  Coal
    Agreement in the interests of good  labour  relations,  it  did  obtain
    something in return  for  making  the  payments.   The  payments  were,
    accordingly, not voluntary.  The key passages from the judgment are  as
    follows:-

         "I therefore think it right to proceed on the basis  that  (a)  the
         applicant was paid under  the  provisions  of  successive  national
         agreements between British Coal and the Union and (b)  she  had  no
         private law claim to the money.  On that footing I  return  to  the
         question in the case which I have identified which requires  me  to
         construe the regulations.  In argument before me all  parties  have
         agreed that the word 'voluntary' bears two different senses in  the
         law.  In Overseers of the Savoy v. Art Union of London [1896]  A.C.
         296, Lord Halsbury said this at p.305: 'My Lords, there is no doubt
         that the word 'voluntary'  is  constantly  used  in  two  different
         senses: it is constantly used as the antithesis of  something  done
         under compulsion; but it is also used commonly among lawyers -  and
         not uncommonly among other people - as denoting  the  obtaining  or
         giving of something without anything being obtained in  return.   A
         lawyer speaks of a voluntary conveyance as  opposed  to  one  which
         involves valuable consideration.  It is  common  to  hear  of  some
         institution supported by  voluntary  contributions.   There  is  no
         doubt of the frequent use of the word  'voluntary'  in  both  these
         senses; and the problem to be solved is in what sense, or in  which
         of these two senses, the Legislature  has  used  the  word  in  the
         section under construction..."


         "... What, then, is the purpose in making a  special  exception  by
         way of disregard in the case of 'any charitable payment or  of  any
         voluntary payment'?  I can discern no sensible purpose in according
         a disregard to any regular payment whatever which happens not to be
         legally enforceable.  In the case of a charitable payment, I  think
         the purpose clear: it is to ensure  that  bodies  which  administer
         funds to  the  disadvantaged  under  charitable  trusts,  and  thus
         shoulder part of the burden of looking after people in our  society
         in difficult or distressed circumstances, should  be  assured  that
         their intended beneficiaries obtain the fruits of their charity  in
         full and that the payments they make will not simply go  pro  tanto
         to relieve the State's obligations.  If that is right, this  policy
         I think gives colour to  that  which  underlies  the  disregard  of
         voluntary  payments  in  the  same  regulation.   In  his  skeleton
         argument, Mr. Howell [counsel for the  DSS]  made  this  submission
         which I accept:


             'Charitable payments are made for  benevolent  purposes.   But
             not all payments made for benevolent purposes are  necessarily
             charitable.  (To be charitable, for example, a purpose has  to
             be one that benefits the public of a sufficient section of  it
             rather than  individuals).   The  effect  of  specifying  both
             charitable and voluntary payments is to enable payments  which
             are not made for the payer's own benefit to be brought  within
             the scope of the disregard without the  need  to  engage  with
             fine  distinctions  between  charitable   and   non-charitable
             payments'.


         It is not necessary, to appreciate the force of this submission, to
         embark upon any discussion of the  law  of  charitable  trusts  for
         which I at any rate would be poorly equipped.   Arrangements  might
         well be made by a body for the  relief  of  some  particular  group
         within those entitled to housing benefit  without  there  being  in
         place all the legal requirements for the existence of a  charitable
         trust.  In my view Mr. Straker  made  an  illuminating  submission,
         which I also accept, when he  said  that  the  question  whether  a
         payment is voluntary is to be judged by looking  at  the  volunteer
         not the recipient so that the issue is not whether  the  payee  has
         any legal rights: it is, rather, what is the nature of the  payment
         from the putative volunteer's point of view?  Looked at in this way
         the nature of the legislative policy here becomes  entirely  clear;
         it is in fact precisely the same as that relating to the charitable
         payments.  The legislator is looking at a payment which is made, to
         use Lord Halsbury's  words,  without  anything  being  obtained  in
         return.  There may, I suppose, even be cases where the recipient of
         the payment could enforce it; certainly there will be  cases  where
         the payer has undertaken an obligation, at least in a  broad  sense
         of the word, to make the payment."

35.   The Boulton case has been considered on a number of occasions  by  the
    Social  Security  Commissioners  (predecessors  of  the  Administrative
    Appeals Chamber  of  the  Upper  Tribunal).   In  case  R(H)  5/05   Mr
    Commissioner Mesher had to consider the effect  of  an  informal  loan,
    consisting of irregular payments made to a claimant by  his  girlfriend
    over a period of the year, following the claimant's inability  to  work
    after a stroke.  The girlfriend had written a  letter  indicating  that
    the payments from her were by way of  a  loan  to  be  repaid  at  some
    unspecified date.  The Commissioner held that the overall circumstances
    showed there had been  no  intention  to  create  legal  relations  and
    therefore no legally enforceable rights or obligations were created  by
    the payments to  the  claimant.   The  case  was  distinguishable  from
    Boulton because the girlfriend making the loan got nothing  in  return,
    tangible or otherwise.  The Commissioner held that the "maintenance  of
    a relationship of personal affection or a familial duty" on the part of
    the payer did not  constitute  an  intangible  benefit  for  the  payer
    sufficient to disqualify the payments as a voluntary payment.

36.   The Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal's  findings  in  KA  (Pakistan)
    regarding disregards for  voluntary  payments  related  to  legislative
    provisions, which have been superseded. The AIT's findings at  [21]  on
    that particular issue should, accordingly, no longer be followed.

37. The final point to observe in relation to  voluntary  payments  is  that
    the 1987 Regulations (regulation 48(9)) treat income as  capital  where
    the voluntary payments are made on an irregular basis.  In other words,
    such payments are treated as individual capital lump sums.


(4)  The rules on capital

38.   This brings us to the way in which capital is treated for the  purpose
    of means-tested benefits.  Generally speaking, "capital" means  a  lump
    sum or one-off payment rather  than  a  series  of  payments  (but  see
    paragraph 35  above).   Capital  sums  are  distinguished  from  income
    because they are not payable in respect of a specific period or periods
    and do not form part of a regular series of payments (R v Supplementary
    Benefits  Commission  ex  parte  Singer  [1973]  1  WLR  713).   Before
    examining the effect of holding capital on entitlement to benefits,  it
    is important to make the following point.  Capital will  not  be  taken
    into account at all unless the respondent has a beneficial interest  in
    it.  In CIS/7097/1995, Mr Commissioner Howell QC said:-

         "It is common ground (and rightly so) that what basically has to be
         assessed for income support is the value of the  capital  resources
         belonging to the individual respondent, corresponding broadly  with
         what he is expected to  use  towards  his  own  maintenance  before
         turning to public assistance; and that what has to be looked at  is
         the true beneficial ownership, not the legal title  to  or  control
         over the assets to which a person may have a beneficial interest."


39.   Where an individual does have a beneficial interest  in  the  capital,
    the basic rules are as follows.  He or she is not  entitled  to  income
    support if he or she  possesses  capital  over  the  prescribed  amount
    (currently  �16,000):  SSCBA  1992,  section  134  and  Income  Support
    (General) Regulations 1987, regulation 45), unless  the  capital  falls
    within one of the "disregards"  listed  in  Schedule  10  to  the  1987
    Regulations.

40.    Capital  under  �6,000  is  ignored  and  does  not  affect   benefit
    entitlement (1987 Regulations, regulation 53).  Where  the  capital  is
    over �6,000 but under �16,000, the individual continues to be  entitled
    to income  support;  but  some  income  from  the  capital  is  assumed
    (regulation 53(1A)).  Such  income  is  called  "tariff  income".   Its
    effect is that weekly payments of benefit will be  reduced  by  �1  for
    every �250 or part the claimant  has  over  �6,000  but  under  �16,000
    (regulation 53(2)).


(5)  "Quistclose" trusts

41.   The result of the "beneficial interest"  test  described  above  means
    that, for example, a loan paid into an individual's bank  account  will
    normally count as his or her capital.  There is a  beneficial  interest
    in the money.  But, if a person is paid money in order  for  it  to  be
    used for a particular purpose and on the condition that the money  must
    be returned if not used for  that  purpose,  then  the  money  will  be
    regarded as being held on trust by that person for that purpose and, if
    it fails,  on  resulting  trust  for  the  original  payer.   It  will,
    accordingly, at least in general,  not  be  treated  as  that  person's
    capital, since he or she has no beneficial interest in it.

42.   The leading case on this matter is Barclays Bank Limited v  Quistclose
    Investments Limited [1970] AC 567. The precise  details  of  that  case
    need not concern us.  A succinct summary of the  difference  between  a
    loan and the principle underlying "Quistclose trusts" is  contained  in
    Halsbury's  Laws  of  England,  Trusts  (Volume  48)  (2007  re-issue),
    paragraph 711:-

         "Money advanced by way of loan normally becomes the property of the
         borrower.  He is free to apply the money as he chooses and save  to
         the extent to which he may have taken security for  repayment,  the
         lender takes the risk of the borrower's insolvency.  However, where
         money is advanced to a  borrower  for  a  stated  purpose  and  the
         borrower  accepts  it  on  terms  that  the  money  will  be   used
         exclusively for that purpose, the money is impressed with  a  trust
         for that purpose, a so-called 'Quistclose  trust'.   The  recipient
         acquires no beneficial interest in the money, at  least  while  the
         designated purpose is still capable of being carried out.   If  the
         designated purpose fails (for example, because the  recipient  goes
         into liquidation), the money will not form part of  the  borrower's
         general funds but will be held for the lender.


         Keeping the money in a separate account is clear evidence  that  it
         is intended for a special purpose but it is not essential".




(6)  Applying these principles in an immigration appeal

43.   In applying these principles in the case of an immigration appeal,  it
    is important to  bear  the  following  matters  in  mind.   First,  the
    appellant carries the legal  burden  of  proving,  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities, that he or she meets the relevant  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Secondly and relatedly, it is necessary  to  recall
    what the Supreme Court said in Mahad.  There, the  Secretary  of  State
    contended (unsuccessfully) that  an  advantage  in  construing  certain
    Immigration Rules as excluding third party support was  that  it  would
    avoid the need to investigate promises of financial support, which were
    "necessarily more precarious... or precarious and... more difficult  to
    verify",  and  that  the  Immigration  Rules  "do   not   provide   for
    undertakings to be taken  from  third  parties".   In  rejecting  those
    submissions Lord Brown said this:-

         "19.     Whilst I readily acknowledge the  legitimacy  of  each  of
             these concerns, their strength seems to me much diminished  by
             a number of  considerations.   First,  whilst  I  accept  that
             generally speaking  unenforceable  third  party  promises  are
             likely to be more precarious and less easily  verifiable  than
             the sponsor's own legal entitlements, that will not invariably
             be so.  And it would surely  be  somewhat  anomalous  if  ECOs
             could  accept  promises  of  continuing  accommodation  and/or
             employment  and  yet  not  promises  of  continuing  payments,
             however regularly they can be shown to have been made  in  the
             past and however wealthy the third party can be  seen  to  be.
             Are rich and devoted  uncles  (or,  indeed,  large  supportive
             immigrant communities  such  as  often  assist  those  seeking
             entry)  really  to  be  ignored  in   this   way?   A   second
             consideration, never to be lost sight of, is that it is always
             for the applicant to satisfy the  ECO  that  any  third  party
             support relied upon is indeed assured.  If he fails to do  so,
             his application will fail.  That this  may  be  difficult  was
             recognised by Collins J himself in Arman Ali (page 103):


                       "I do not doubt that it will be rare for applicant to
                  be  able  to  satisfy  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  the
                  Secretary  of  State  or  an  Adjudicator  that  long-term
                  maintenance by a third party  will  be  provided  so  that
                  there will be no recourse to public funds.  But whether or
                  not such long-term support will be provided is a  question
                  of fact to be determined on the evidence".


             Of course there may be  difficulties  of  investigation.   But
             that is already so with regard  to  many  different  sorts  of
             application and, indeed, is likely to be  so  with  regard  to
             some of the kinds of third party support already  conceded  to
             be acceptable."


44.   The conclusion to be  drawn  is,  accordingly,  that  any  case  which
    depends for its success upon a third  party's  voluntary  payment  will
    need to be scrutinised with particular care. That is  so  of  all  such
    cases, whether or not the third party payments fall to be  examined  by
    reference to their potential effect on State  benefits  provided  to  a
    sponsor, the continued entitlement to which is relevant to the  outcome
    of the appeal.  Much will turn on the  credibility  of  the  appellant,
    sponsor and third party, both generally and as to the specifics of  the
    actual payments.

45.   The same is true  in  relation  to  any  assertion  on  behalf  of  an
    appellant that income paid to or capital sums held by a sponsor who  is
    in  receipt  of  benefits  are  to  be  treated  as  being  subject  to
    "Quistclose trusts".  Judicial fact-finders will usually need  to  have
    cogent, credible evidence  before  finding  that  capital  held  by  an
    individual is, in truth, held on such a trust.  A specific decision  on
    the matter in an individual's  favour  by  the  DWP  will  normally  be
    determinative, unless it can be shown that  that  Department  has  been
    materially misled.  On the other hand, the mere absence of  an  adverse
    DWP decision will not usually  take  the  appellant's  case  materially
    forward, particularly if there is nothing to suggest that the existence
    of the capital has been brought to the DWP's attention.

46.   It seems to us that, since these issues involve mixed  fact  and  law,
    an appellant in an immigration appeal must be able  to  demonstrate  to
    the judicial fact-finder, either that the actual financial position  on
    arrival will be such as to make it unnecessary to rely upon benefits in
    order to provide a standard of living equivalent to that  available  on
    means  tested  benefits,  or  that  the  relevant  law  bears  on   the
    circumstances of the family, in such  a  way  that  there  will  be  no
    additional recourse to public funds in doing so.


(7)  The circumstances of the present case

(a) Findings of fact, including credibility

47.   We now turn to the circumstances of the respondent's case.   Like  the
    First-tier Judge,  we  have  had  the  opportunity  of  receiving  oral
    evidence from the sponsor and her mother.  As that judge found, we have
    concluded that both are entirely credible witnesses.   They  each  gave
    their evidence in a straightforward manner.   There  were  no  material
    discrepancies.  Mr Saunders  did  not  seek  to  make  any  submissions
    regarding their credibility.

48.   The truth of the matter is, we find, essentially as  the  sponsor  and
    her mother have said.  Legal advice was sought before the making of the
    respondent's present application for entry clearance.  Fortunately  for
    the respondent, the sponsor and her mother were  able  to  act  on  the
    advice, since the mother and her husband have ample financial resources
    to fund the respondent in the United Kingdom, not just at the  time  of
    entry but also until such time as he may be able to obtain remunerative
    employment, such that he and his immediate family are able to  maintain
    themselves without additional recourse to public funds or  third  party
    support.

49.   We find that the respondent has shown on the balance of  probabilities
    that the weekly sums paid, initially into the  sponsor's  bank  account
    and subsequently into the Yorkshire Bank account in  the  name  of  the
    mother and the respondent,  were never  such  as  to  fall  within  the
    sponsor's beneficial ownership.  Both  these  sums  and  the  resulting
    capital sums  were  held  by  the  sponsor  under  "Quistclose"  trusts
    (although the sponsor and her mother were  no  doubt  unaware  of  this
    terminology).

50.   We accept, as did the First-tier Tribunal judge  that,  if  necessary,
    any further small shortfall,  would be similarly met by the mother  and
    that this intention and ability on her part existed at the date of  the
    entry clearance officer's decision. In fact, for the  reason  given  by
    the First-tier Tribunal judge, there is no need for the  mother  to  do
    so: the capital sum available for  the  respondent  to  use  after  his
    arrival will plainly cover it.




(b)  The position on arrival in the United Kingdom

51.   With this last finding, we come to the hypothetical position upon  the
    respondent's arrival in the United Kingdom shortly after  the  decision
    on the entry clearance application.  The effect of  that  arrival  upon
    the benefits position needs to be considered in the following respects.



52.   First, the sponsor would no longer be a lone parent.  If  the  sponsor
    needed to maintain the income  she  was  receiving  by  way  of  income
    support, we find that she would be able to claim jobseeker's  allowance
    in place of that former benefit.  She would of course have to submit to
    the various conditions regarding availability for work etc which attach
    to that benefit.  We infer  that,  although  she  has  two  very  young
    children, if necessary the respondent could make himself available  for
    childcare.  The rates for income-based jobseeker's allowance and income
    support are, in fact, the same.  For  the  purpose  of  entitlement  to
    means-tested  benefits,  the  respondent's  liability  to   immigration
    control means that the couple will be treated as a single  person  (see
    1987 Regulations,  Schedule  7,  para  16A  and  Jobseeker's  Allowance
    Regulations 1996, Schedule 5, paragraph 13A(a)).  In  this  respect  at
    any rate, the result of the respondent's arrival would not be to  cause
    the couple to be entitled to  increased  or  additional  public  funds,
    contrary to paragraphs 6A to C of the immigration rules.

53.   Second, the respondent would  come  into  possession  of  the  sum  of
    �5920, which we calculate was the amount accumulated as at the date  of
    decision. The assets of the respondent and sponsor  would  fall  to  be
    aggregated for the purposes of assessment of  entitlement  to  benefits
    (regulation  32  of  the   1987   Regulations),   notwithstanding   the
    respondent's status as a person subject to  immigration  control.   But
    that capital sum, being under �6000, would  be  ignored  (paragraph  40
    above); and, even though that this sum would have grown by �160 a  week
    over the period between the date of that decision  and  the  time  when
    (assuming the decision had been in  the  respondent's  favour  and  not
    appealed) he would have arrived in the United Kingdom, it can  be  seen
    from the figures for tariff income  in  paragraph  40  above  that  the
    reduction in benefit caused by regulation  53(2)  would  have  been  so
    small as to be, in all the circumstances, immaterial.

54.   Third, there are the weekly payments from  the  sponsor's  mother.  We
    accept her evidence that she would continue to pay the �160 a  week  to
    the respondent, after his arrival, until such time as it was no  longer
    needed. Unlike the position pre-arrival, where  the  weekly  sums  have
    been paid under Quistclose trusts, post-arrival  the  sums  would  come
    into the respondent's immediate legal  and  beneficial  ownership.  The
    circumstances in which they were paid by the mother would, we find,  be
    directly analogous to those in R (H) 5/05 (paragraph  33  above).  They
    would be voluntary payments, which would  fall  to  be  disregarded  by
    reason of Schedule 9 to the 1987 Regulations (paragraph 33  above)  or,
    more  probably  by  then,  the  equivalent  provision   in   the   1996
    Regulations: Schedule 7, paragraph 15.

55.   Fourth, the amount of child benefit is determined  by  the  number  of
    children.  Child benefit is not means-tested and is not "public  funds"
    within the meaning of  paragraph  6  of  the  immigration  rules.   The
    respondent's arrival would have no impact.

56.   Fifth, we can see no reason why the amount of child tax credit  should
    be any different if the respondent were to be in the United Kingdom.

57.   Sixth, we need to consider the position regarding housing benefit.  At
    the  date  of  decision  the  sponsor  was  living   in   two-bedroomed
    accommodation provided by a registered social landlord, who was content
    for the respondent to live there also (no  issue  was  taken  regarding
    adequacy of accommodation). Accordingly, there would be  no  change  in
    the family's accommodation requirements and, thus, no increase  in  the
    "eligible rent" used for the purposes of the sponsor's housing  benefit
    claim. There would, as a result, be no change to the sponsor's  housing
    benefit.

58.   Seventh, we need to say something about council tax  benefit.  Council
    tax did not feature as an issue between the parties at the hearing  and
    the  evidence  regarding  it  is,  consequently,  not  very   detailed.
    Nevertheless, it appears as a matter of law that  there  would  in  one
    sense be a change in the family's entitlement  to  benefits,  following
    the respondent's arrival, as regards council tax benefit. At  the  date
    of decision the sponsor's liability to council tax, in respect  of  her
    house, would have  been  reduced  by  25%  because  she  was  the  only
    "resident", as defined by the relevant  legislation  (Local  Government
    Finance Act 1992, section 6). The absence of any evidence  of  payments
    of council tax by the sponsor indicates (as one would expect) that,  as
    a person in receipt of  income  support,  the  sponsor's  liability  to
    council tax was being met in full by council tax benefit.

59.   The arrival of the respondent would mean that  the  sponsor  would  no
    longer be the only "resident". The  25%  discount  would,  accordingly,
    cease to apply. The sponsor's continuing entitlement to income  support
    (or income-based jobseeker's allowance) means  that  she  would  become
    entitled to council tax benefit covering her new,  larger  council  tax
    liability. There is  a  sense  in  which  this  is  a  mere  matter  of
    accounting. Pre-arrival, the sponsor  is  spared  having  to  meet  the
    council tax liability in respect of her home by a  combination  of  the
    25% discount and by council  tax  benefit.  Post  arrival,  this  would
    happen entirely by virtue of council tax benefit.  Nonetheless,  unless
    the sponsor can disclaim  at  least  so  much  of  the  benefit  as  is
    equivalent to the former discount, the respondent risks falling foul of
    paragraph 6C of the immigration rules, since the benefits paid  to  the
    family will be greater than those paid before he arrived in the  United
    Kingdom.

60.   On a reading of paragraph 6C, there could be said  to  be  no  problem
    with this scenario. The recourse to  public  funds  described  in  that
    paragraph arises only where the person concerned (P) "relies  upon  the
    future entitlement to any public funds that would be payable  to  P  or
    P's sponsor as a result of P's presence in  the  United  Kingdom"  (our
    emphasis). If the respondent and the sponsor can show  they  would  not
    need to rely on the additional council tax benefit in order to meet the
    KA (Pakistan) benchmark, then paragraph 6C has no  purchase.  Since  we
    heard no argument on this issue, we do not consider we  can  reach  any
    substantive conclusion. In any case, it is unnecessary to do so for the
    following reason.

61.   Subject to immaterial exceptions, section 1  of  the  Social  Security
    Administration Act 1992 makes it a  condition  of  entitlement  to  any
    benefit that a person has made a valid claim for it.  Although  we  are
    unaware of any mechanism whereby, following the  respondent's  arrival,
    the sponsor could claim what  would  represent  only  75%  of  her  new
    council tax benefit, she plainly could decide not to claim any  of  it.
    Drawing on the experience of Judge Ward, who normally sits in  the  AAC
    Chamber of the Tribunal, by reference to the location and size  of  the
    sponsor's property, even on a conservative assumption the  council  tax
    is highly unlikely to have been more than �30 a week. It is clear  from
    the  evidence  that  the  capital  sum  will  cover  this  amount,  the
    additional cost of maintaining a couple rather than a  lone  parent  by
    reference to the income support  rates  and  the  very  modest  amounts
    necessary to compensate for the attribution of  tariff  income,  should
    that be necessary. The resolve of the sponsor  and  her  mother  to  do
    everything necessary to ensure compliance with the rules is,  we  find,
    such that they would if necessary adopt the course of  action  we  have
    just described (and would have done so as at the date of decision).

62.   The final point to be made in relation to the  post-arrival  situation
    is one which did not feature  in  argument  before  us,  but  which  we
    consider needs to be addressed, for completeness. Despite  passages  in
    the judgments in AM and French that might at first  sight  be  said  to
    point to the contrary, we do not  consider  that  those  judgments  (or
    those in Abubakar v Entry Clearance Officer (Sana'a)  [2012]  EWCA  Civ
    377) mean that actual income support paid to a United  Kingdom  sponsor
    must  be  disregarded  in  calculating  the  income  available  to  the
    applicant and sponsor, post arrival. At [76] to [80] of AM, Laws LJ  in
    effect held that it was not possible for a sponsor mother to apply part
    of her income support towards the maintenance of her son, MA;  however,
    in so holding, it seems the Court of Appeal did not approach the matter
    on the basis, since established by the Court of Appeal judgments  cited
    at paragraph 27 above, that the post-arrival incomes of  applicant  and
    sponsor fell to be aggregated. The Court of  Appeal's  approval  of  KA
    (Pakistan), in relation to what the AIT in that case had said about the
    relevant income support level being the target figure (which was not to
    be diminished by claims that a person or  persons  could,  in  reality,
    live on less) would be undermined if actual income support  paid  to  a
    sponsor must be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the  income
    support available to the family unit. For then the target figure would,
    in reality, be higher than the income support level  for  that  family.
    Nothing in French or Abubakar supports such a result.

(c) Conclusion

63.   The consequence of these findings is that the respondent has shown  on
    balance that  he  meets  the  requirements  of  paragraph  281  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Were he to be granted entry clearance as the spouse
    of the sponsor, this would  not  involve  any  additional  recourse  to
    public funds.

   PARAGRAPHS 6A TO C OF THE IMMIGRATION RULES (AS IN FORCE IN RESPECT OF
                    APPLICATIONS MADE BEFORE 9 JULY 2012)

    6A      For the purpose of these Rules, a  person (P)  is  not  to  be
         regarded as having (or potentially having) recourse to public funds
         because P is (or will be) reliant in whole or in  part  on  public
         funds provided to P's sponsor unless, as a result of  P's  presence
         in the United Kingdom, the sponsor is (or would  be)  entitled  to
         increased or additional public funds (save where  such  entitlement
         to increased or additional public funds is by virtue of P  and  the
         sponsor's joint  entitlement  to  benefits  under  the  regulations
         referred to in paragraph 6B).


    6B      Subject to paragraph 6C, a person (P) shall not be regarded as
         having recourse to public  funds  if  P  is  entitled  to  benefits
         specified under section 115 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999
         by virtue of regulations made under sub-sections (3)  and  (4)  of
         that section or section 42 of the Tax Credits Act 2002.


    6C      A  person  (P)  making  an   application   from   outside   the
         United Kingdom will be regarded as having recourse to public funds
         where P relies upon the future entitlement to any public funds that
         would be payable to P or to P's sponsor as a result of P's presence
         in the United Kingdom, (including those benefits to which P or the
         sponsor would be entitled as  a  result  of  P's  presence  in  the
         United Kingdom under the regulations referred to in paragraph 6B).
