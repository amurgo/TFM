Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N. Bramble, Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the decision  by  the
    Respondent to refuse to extend her discretionary leave to remain in the
    United Kingdom.  The First-tier Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity
    order, and I do not consider that an anonymity order is  warranted  for
    these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of  Uganda,  whose  date  of  birth  is  19
    January 1990.  According to the immigration  history  set  out  at  the
    beginning of the Home Office  bundle,  the  appellant  claims  to  have
    entered the country via  an  agent  on  20  February  2006,  after  her
    grandmother and aunt died in Uganda.  On 26 April 2006 she submitted an
    application for leave to remain as a child of a person in the  UK  with
    leave to remain or ILR,  but  this  application  was  refused.   On  20
    October 2008 she was served  with  an  IS15A  removal  notice.   On  21
    January 2009 she applied for leave to remain outside the Rules.   On  5
    May 2010 she was granted discretionary leave to remain which ran  until
    19 January 2011.  On 18 January 2011 she applied for  an  extension  of
    her discretionary leave to remain.  This was granted  for  three  years
    "as she was dependent on her mother and stepfather".

 3. On 15 March 2013 the appellant  applied  for  a  further  extension  of
    discretionary leave.  In her application form, she said she lived in  a
    flat in London SE16.  This  was  free  accommodation  provided  by  her
    mother.  She was working in the UK, and her pay each month after income
    tax and other deductions was �750.  She was asked whether a relative or
    friend of hers regularly gave her money, and she answered no.  She said
    she had last been in Uganda in 2007, and  she  did  not  have  ties  to
    Uganda any  longer.   The  application  form  was  completed  with  the
    assistance of the appellant's legal representatives, a firm in  Croydon
    ("the Croydon Firm").

 4.  The  appellant's  stepfather  wrote  a  letter  in  support   of   the
    application, dated 26 February 2013.  The letter was  written  from  an
    address in Bexley, Kent.  He wrote the letter not only  in  support  of
    the appellant's application for further discretionary leave to  remain,
    but also in support of a parallel application by his  wife  Sarah,  who
    was also the appellant's mother.  He  explained  that  he  had  married
    Sarah (the appellant's mother) in August 2009 and they had lived at the
    Bexley address ever since.  His wife had worked for the  NHS  since  he
    had known her.  They had  been  able  to  support  Esther  through  her
    education and had financed her studies at UCL for two years.  This  had
    cost �3,500 a year in fees and another  �3,000  in  support.   She  had
    worked diligently and had secured a diploma,  and  she  would  like  to
    extend her studies to obtain a degree.  They were frequently visited by
    Esther, who stayed with her brother at his wife's old  flat  in  Canada
    Water.  He had noted in the last few years that  Esther  had  become  a
    bright, competent and happy young woman who was very intelligent.   She
    now had a part-time job which  gave  her  some  pocket  money,  not  to
    mention independence (my emphasis) and self-respect.  He was sure  that
    when the case was considered, the Home  Office  would  agree  that  his
    wife's good character and employment record proved that she  was  fully
    integrated and had become a useful member of society; and  that  Esther
    had a bright future which enabled her to be of considerable benefit  to
    the UK and to herself.

 5. On 26 April 2013 the Secretary of State gave her reasons  for  refusing
    the application.  The appellant had previously been granted DLR  on  10
    February 2011 on the basis that she was still dependent on  her  mother
    and her stepfather in the United Kingdom.  But due to the fact that she
    stated that she earned �750 per  month,  and  submitted  evidence  that
    showed that she earned in excess of this amount, she was able  to  lead
    an independent life, separate to that of her mother and stepfather.  So
    after carefully reviewing the application, the Secretary of  State  was
    not satisfied that the grounds under which she was  previously  granted
    discretionary leave still persisted and  her  application  for  further
    discretionary leave was refused.

 6. The Secretary of State went on  to  consider  the  application  of  the
    exemption criteria in EX.1 of Appendix FM.  The appellant did not  meet
    the requirements to be considered under EX.1 because she did not have a
    partner or a child in the UK.  The application of Rule 276ADE had  also
    been considered.  She had not lived continuously in the UK for at least
    twenty years.  At the time of her application she was aged 23.  She had
    not spent half of her life living in the  United  Kingdom.   She  spent
    sixteen years of her life living in Uganda and, in the absence  of  any
    evidence to the contrary, it was not accepted that  in  the  period  of
    time she had been in the UK she had lost all ties to her home country.

 7. The Croydon firm settled lengthy grounds of appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the appellant's behalf.  The appellant's case was that  her
    mother, Sarah Rogers, first entered the United Kingdom in July 1999 and
    claimed asylum.  An application was then made for  her  to  be  granted
    leave to remain on the basis of marriage to Mr Richard Gindogo.   Sarah
    was then granted discretionary leave to  remain  after  the  respondent
    delayed deciding her marriage application for a  period  in  excess  of
    five years.  Sarah's marriage to Mr  Gindogo  broke  down,  and  for  a
    period of time Sarah was without leave to  remain.   She  then  made  a
    fresh claim based on her family life with her second husband, a British
    national by the name of Mr Paul Rogers.  Discretionary leave to  remain
    was granted to her on 15  March  2010  for  a  period  of  three  years
    expiring on 15 March 2013.  The appellant arrived in the UK seven years
    ago in 2006 to join her mother.  The appellant had a pending claim  for
    permission to apply for judicial review of the ongoing failure  of  the
    respondent to resolve her case under legacy.

 8. The refusal of further discretionary leave to remain to  the  appellant
    was  contrary  to  the  Secretary  of  State's  declared  policy   that
    applicants who were granted leave under the discretionary leave  policy
    before 9 July 2012 continued to be considered under discretionary leave
    policy through to settlement provided they  continued  to  qualify  for
    leave and their circumstances have  not  changed.   It  was  clear  the
    appellant was entitled to an extension of DL as her  circumstances  had
    not changed.  The conclusion that she was leading an  independent  life
    was  perverse.   Her  parents  were  paying  her  rent  and  university
    education fees.  The appellant  should  be  commended  for  having  the
    energy and desire to improve her life in the UK by working part-time to
    earn an income and to gain working experience.  The  appellant  clearly
    could  not  live  independently  on  such  a  low  income,   with   her
    commitments.  While she might have been granted discretionary leave  to
    reside with her mother, family life nonetheless continued to  exist  in
    the UK despite the  appellant's  age.   Furthermore,  the  respondent's
    failure to grant the appellant leave to remain  to  conclude  her  case
    under legacy weighed in her favour.

 9. The appeal was listed to be heard at Hatton Cross on 23 April 2014.  On
    17 April 2014 the Croydon firm wrote  to  the  Tribunal  requesting  an
    adjournment.  The application was supported by  a  39  page  bundle  of
    documents which referred to judicial review proceedings  involving  Mrs
    Rogers, the appellant and the respondent.  The Croydon  Firm  submitted
    that until the  legacy  judicial  review  was  determined  by  JR,  the
    proceedings  before  the  Tribunal  could  not  justly  be  determined.
    Additionally, the appellant was unable  to  prepare  for  her  Tribunal
    hearing whilst the issue of the legacy matter was undecided.

10. The appellant's representatives then went on at some length to  explain
    why the claim for judicial review  was  "not  academic".   Among  other
    things, the appellant relied upon the fact that after the withdrawal of
    "the asylum claims" (sic), she received  correspondence  informing  her
    that her case would be concluded under the legacy programme.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

11. The adjournment application could not be dealt with in advance  of  the
    hearing, so it was addressed at the outset of the hearing before First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Widdup at Hatton  Cross  on  23  April  2014.   The
    appellant was represented  by  a  barrister  ("Mr  C"),  who  had  been
    instructed by the Croydon Firm.  The respondent was represented  by  Ms
    McGrath, Home Office Presenting Officer.

12. In paragraphs 5 to 11 of his  subsequent  determination,  Judge  Widdup
    records how the adjournment application proceeded,  and  the  arguments
    advanced in support of it by Mr C.  Judge  Widdup  asked  him  why  the
    appeal against the immigration decision could not be justly  determined
    now.  Mr C said that the decision appealed against  was  incomplete  as
    the legacy policy issue had not been  determined.   But  after  further
    questioning, Mr C accepted that they were ready  to  proceed  with  the
    appeal.  The suggestion that the  appeal  was  not  ready  for  hearing
    referred to the fact that the JR proceedings had not concluded.

13. The judge's reasons for refusing the adjournment  application  are  set
    out in paragraph 11.  He noted there were parallel proceedings  in  the
    High Court and these proceedings could only be pursued if all  remedies
    in lower courts had been exhausted.  He considered there would be  some
    considerable delay before the appeal could be re-listed, and  therefore
    the appeal ought to proceed today.

14. The judge's account of the remainder of  the  hearing  is  set  out  in
    paragraphs 12 to 19 of his subsequent determination.   Mr  C  said  the
    appeal would proceed on submissions only.   The  judge  expressed  some
    surprise at this in view of the fact-sensitive nature of an  Article  8
    appeal.  Mr C submitted that no significant changes had occurred  since
    the decision in 2011.  The judge informed Mr C that he  would  consider
    whether evidence was needed as the hearing proceeded.

15. Mr C referred to the appellant's immigration history  set  out  in  the
    respondent's bundle.  She had last been granted discretionary leave  to
    remain when she was aged 21.  His core submission was that there was no
    significant change in circumstances since 2011: the appellant had  been
    an adult in 2011.  In addition,  the  respondent  only  considered  the
    application under the new Rules  and  no  consideration  of  Article  8
    "generally" had taken place.  The other factors relevant to  Article  8
    overlapped with the legacy issues.

16. Judge Widdup asked Mr C what circumstances should have been taken  into
    account.  He said the length of the appellant's residence was relevant.
     The appellant had lived in the UK since 2006.  She had no  convictions
    and leave had previously been granted to her.   Her  circumstances  had
    been strengthened by the additional time  she  had  now  spent  in  the
    United Kingdom, and by the fact that she was working  and  contributing
    to the UK economy.

17. At this point the judge told Mr C that he was  being  asked  to  decide
    these issues in an evidential vacuum.  The judge asked  Ms  McGrath  if
    she had any objection to the appellant being asked questions.  She said
    she did not provided they were confined to issues about her employment.
     The judge assessed it would be appropriate if he asked  the  appellant
    the questions, and neither representative objected.  The judge went  on
    to elicit the following evidence from the appellant which is set out in
    paragraph 16:

         The appellant said that she  works  twenty  hours  per  week  as  a
         cashier at Morrisons in Peckham.  She earns �600pm.  She is not now
         a student.  She has worked there for a year.  She has no other part-
         time work.  She has an HND in health and social care  level  6  and
         could work as a care worker with  children  or  in  health  related
         work.  She would like to work full-time in  a  hospital  and  could
         work as a healthcare assistant.  She cannot now do so without leave
         to remain.  She was asked by Ms McGrath if there was any reason why
         she could not do that work in Uganda.  She said  "not  really"  and
         then said she did not think so because it was  a  different  system
         and she would be retrained.  Mr [C] had no questions.

18. In her closing submissions on behalf  of  the  respondent,  Ms  McGrath
    relied on the refusal letter and submitted there had been a substantial
    change of circumstances since 2011: the appellant had been working  and
    could lead an independent life.  Her experience with UK  qualifications
    would assist  her  in  Uganda.   Mr  C  submitted  in  reply  that  the
    appellant's case was that she was not (my emphasis)  dependent  on  her
    mother in 2011, and that therefore nothing had changed.  In addition it
    was not reasonable in all  the  circumstances  for  her  to  return  to
    Uganda. It was common ground that the respondent  had  written  to  the
    appellant saying that her case would be considered  within  the  legacy
    policy.

19. The judge's conclusions are set out in paragraphs 20 following  of  his
    subsequent  determination.   He  was  very  surprised   the   appellant
    representatives did not take  the  simple  step  of  preparing  witness
    statements by the appellant and her mother  and  stepfather  about  the
    appellant's past and present circumstances.  Each Article  8  case  was
    highly fact sensitive.  In this case he has been invited to decide  the
    appeal on the basis that there had been no real change in circumstances
    since 2011.  However, save for the evidence prompted by him  about  the
    appellant's work and qualifications for work, no evidence had been  put
    before him to enable to make a comparison of the  appellant's  personal
    and financial circumstances in 2011 and now, or to prove the  appellant
    was independent of her mother in 2011.  In addition no  hearing  bundle
    was prepared, save that which related to the adjournment application.

20. At paragraph 27 the judge observed that  the  core  submission  of  the
    appellant was that she was not dependent on her mother in 2011 nor  was
    she now: that meant that she did not have any family life with her.  He
    accepted that she had a private life and that this  had  been  acquired
    since 2006.  Her private life included her relationship with her mother
    and stepfather, but  he  had  no  evidence  of  the  strength  of  that
    relationship.

21. On the issue of proportionality, the  judge  held  that  the  following
    factors weighed in favour of the respondent, namely the fact  that  the
    appellant came to the UK without leave to enter or remain and was  only
    granted discretionary leave to remain when she was aged 19.

22. The appellant was now working on a  qualification  which  provided  her
    with the prospect of full-time work  in  a  healthcare  setting.   That
    qualification was obtained in the  UK.   She  was  independent  of  her
    mother.  She had led a law-abiding life in the UK.  She was brought  up
    in  Uganda  until  she  was  16.   It  was  impossible  to  assess  the
    circumstances which awaited her in Uganda if she returned there because
    no evidence had been adduced by the appellant on this.

23. The judge went on to address  in  detail  the  appellant's  case  under
    legacy.  He found at paragraph 38  the  legacy  issue  had  no  bearing
    whatsoever on proportionality for  two  reasons.   Firstly  the  asylum
    claim was withdrawn and was thereby concluded.  Secondly no  legitimate
    expectation could arise that the case would be considered under legacy.
     So the legacy issue was not one  which  was  of  weight  in  assessing
    proportionality.   In  contrast,  the  length  of  time  spent  by  the
    appellant in the United Kingdom since her arrival was a matter of clear
    relevance and importance.

24. The judge reached the following conclusion at paragraph 40:

         In considering whether that factor and the other  relevant  factors
         as such the decision can be said to  be  disproportionate,  I  take
         into account the appellant has skills which may be an advantage  to
         her in Uganda.  She is now an independent adult who is  capable  of
         supporting herself.  Taking all matters into  account  relevant  to
         proportionality  I  find  the  interests  of  the   appellant   are
         outweighed by the legitimate aim of  immigration  control  and  her
         return to Uganda is not therefore disproportionate.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

25.  The  appellant  instructed  new  legal  representatives,  who  settled
    extensive grounds for permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Ground 1 is that the judge should have adjourned the  appeal  to  allow
    the judicial review proceedings to be concluded.  Ground 2 is the judge
    should have adjourned the appeal to allow the  appeal  to  be  properly
    prepared.

26. Ground 3 is not a separate ground as such, but an application to adduce
    evidence that was not  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  order  to
    buttress ground 2.

27. Ground 4 is not a separate ground  of  appeal  as  such,  but  contains
    observations on the implications of the  legacy  programme  which  are,
    presumably, designed to underpin ground 1.

28. Ground 5 is that the appellant's case was incorrectly considered  under
    the new Immigration Rules.  Ground 6 is that, if the Immigration  Rules
    did apply (contrary to the appellant's primary case), her appeal should
    have been allowed under Rule 276ADE(vi) as she had no  ties  (including
    social, cultural or family) with the country to which she would have to
    go if required to leave the United Kingdom.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

29. On 13 June 2014 Designated Judge Baird granted permission to appeal for
    the following reasons:

         Whilst I appreciate and accept the appellant was on the face of  it
         represented it is clear that the  decision  was  made  without  any
         statements having been  provided  and  without  evidence  from  her
         family, on the basis of the documents provided  by  the  respondent
         and the few questions asked by  the  judge  about  the  appellant's
         employment.  The appellant's statement lists errors  of  fact  that
         were made by the judge including a finding that the  appellant  had
         withdrawn an asylum claim and that she had never made one, that she
         lives independently from her family which she does not.   The  lack
         of preparation was commented on by the judge and it seems to me  to
         be arguable that the judge ought to have adjourned the appeal.   It
         is arguable too that he erred in his understanding of the facts  of
         the case which may have led to an error of law.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

30. At the hearing before me, Mr Hawkins reported that  the  appellant  had
    been refused permission to proceed with her claim for judicial  review,
    and therefore that ground  of  appeal  fell  away.   But  the  concerns
    expressed by Designated Judge Baird when granting permission to  appeal
    remained valid.  In reply, Mr Bramble relied on the  Rule  24  response
    settled by Mr Sebastian Kandola of the Specialist Appeals  Team  on  26
    June 2014 where he said:

         There is no obligation for the Tribunal to adjourn a  hearing  just
         to await the outcome of a legacy decision either by the SSHD or  by
         another court: AZ (Asylum - legacy cases) Afghanistan  [2013]  UKUT
         270 (IAC) (10 June 2013).  The judge did not err in law in  failing
         to adjourn because the solicitors had decided not to prepare  their
         client's case on the basis that they  thought  they  would  get  an
         adjournment, nor  on  the  basis  that  instructing  Counsel  acted
         without instructions against the best interests of his client - the
         appellant's remedy lies before the officer's solicitor  supervision
         or the Bar Council not the Upper Tribunal, it  can  only  interfere
         with an FTT decision if there was  a  material  error  of  law  not
         because the appellant's legal team acted incompetently.

31. Mr Hawkins informed me that an official complaint had been  made  about
    the Croydon Firm of Solicitors, and the complaint had been referred  to
    a legal ombudsman.  No complaint had been made against  the  barrister.
    If the complaint against the solicitors was upheld, this would be of no
    comfort to the appellant who had been deprived of a fair hearing before
    the First-tier Tribunal as a consequence of evidence of  her  emotional
    dependency on her parents not being deployed in evidence.

Discussion

32. Although not cited to me, in determining this appeal I have had  regard
    to MM (Unfairness: E & R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 00105 (IAC) a  decision  of
    the President and Upper Tribunal Judge Southern.  The headnote reads as
    follows:

         1.   Where there is a defect or impropriety of a procedural  nature
             in the proceedings at first instance, this  may  amount  to  a
             material error of law requiring the decision of the First-tier
             Tribunal to be set aside.

         2.   A successful appeal is not dependent on the  demonstration  of
             some failing on the part of the FTT.  Thus no error of law may
             be found to have occurred in circumstances where some material
             evidence, through no fault of the  FTT,  was  not  considered,
             with a resulting unfairness (E & R v Secretary  of  State  for
             the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 49).

33. As discussed in paragraph [19] of the decision, in E &  R  Carnwath  LJ
    found that the unfairness in that case arose from  the  combination  of
    five factors:

         (i)  an erroneous impression created by mistake as to, or ignorance
             of, a relevant fact (the availability of reliable evidence  to
             support her case);

         (ii) the fact was established, in the sense that, if attention  had
             been drawn to the point, the correct position could have  been
             shown by objective and uncontentious evidence;

         (iii)    the claimant could not fairly be held responsible for  the
             error;

         (iv) although there was no duty on the board itself, or the police,
             to do the  claimant's  work  of  proving  her  case,  all  the
             participants had a shared interest in cooperating  to  achieve
             the correct result;

         (v)   the  mistaken  impression  played  a  material  part  in  the
             reasoning.

34. Carnwath LJ went on to hold at paragraph [66] that  the  time  had  now
    come to accept the mistake of fact giving  rise  to  unfairness  was  a
    separate head of challenge in an appeal on a point of law, at least  in
    those statutory contexts  where  the  parties  shared  an  interest  in
    cooperating to achieve the correct result.  Asylum law was  undoubtedly
    such an area.  Without seeking to lay down a precise code:

         First, there must have been a  mistake  as  to  an  existing  fact,
         including a mistake  as  to  the  availability  of  evidence  on  a
         particular matter.  Secondly, the fact or evidence must  have  been
         established, in the sense that it was uncontentious and objectively
         verifiable.  Thirdly, the  appellant  (or  his  advisors)  was  not
         responsible for the  mistake.   Fourthly,  the  mistake  must  have
         played a material  (but  not  necessarily  decisive)  part  in  the
         Tribunal's reasoning.

35. At paragraph [21] of MM, the Presidential panel held that simple  logic
    meant that the decision in E & R applied  fully  to  appeals  from  the
    First-tier Tribunal to the Upper Tribunal.   The  panel  considered  it
    important to emphasise in appeals of the present kind the criterion  to
    be applied was not  that  of  reasonableness.   In  that  respect,  the
    present case was a paradigm of its type.  The judge's  conduct  of  the
    hearing at first instance was beyond reproach.  The irregularity  which
    had been  exposed  was  entirely  unrelated  to  how  the  hearing  was
    conducted.  The judge could  not  possibly  be  faulted  for  the  non-
    emergence of the solicitor's letter.  By any showing, the  judge  acted
    responsibly and reasonably throughout.   However,  as  the  authorities
    demonstrated clearly,  the  criterion  to  be  applied  on  review  was
    fairness, not reasonableness.

36. The panel  went  on  to  find  on  the  facts  the  judge  had  plainly
    disbelieved the appellant's claim concerning  her  instructions.   This
    belief was grounded substantially on a  mistake  of  fact,  namely  the
    erroneous belief that no  such  instructions  had  been  given  by  the
    appellant and no such letter had been  written.   The  judge  in  terms
    found the appellant to  be  mendacious  and  this  became  one  of  the
    important building blocks in his overall  assessment  that  her  claims
    were not worthy of belief.  The resulting unfairness to  the  appellant
    was palpable.  The panel continued in paragraph [25]:

         The pivotal  importance  of  the  error  of  fact  upon  which  the
         reasoning of the judge was demonstrably based helps to explain why,
         in appeals raising issues of  international  protection,  there  is
         room for departure from the inflexible application  of  common  law
         rules and principles where this is necessary to redress unfairness.
          This is particularly so where the respondent has in the  words  of
         Carnwath LJ in E &  R,  paragraph  [66],  failed  to  cooperate  to
         achieve a correct result.  As we have seen, generally, the first of
         the Ladd v Marshall principles require that the new evidence  which
         was not considered at the earlier hearing could not with reasonable
         diligence have been obtained at that stage.  Plainly that cannot be
         said here because the letter was written by the very solicitors who
         were presenting  the  case  before  the  Tribunal  and  so  it  was
         available.  It was established that neither the Rule in  Al-Mehdawi
         v SSHD [1991] AC 887  (that  a  procedural  failure  caused  by  an
         appellant's own representative did not lead to an appeal  being  in
         breach of the rules of natural justice) nor a failure to  meet  the
         first of the Ladd v Marshall principles applies with full rigour in
         asylum and human rights appeals: see EGFP (Iran) v SSHD [2007] EWCA
         Civ 13.  The decision of the Court of Appeal in E and R v Secretary
         of State points toward a broader  approach,  in  which  the  common
         right to a fair hearing predominates.  We consider that this appeal
         must succeed accordingly.

37. MM is in play here, as the primary error of law challenge mounted by Mr
    Hawkins is that the appellant was deprived of a fair hearing before the
    First-tier  Tribunal  due  to  gross  incompetence   and   professional
    misconduct  on  the  part  of  her  legal  representatives,  both   the
    solicitors and the barrister.  It is for this reason that  I  have  not
    identified the firm or the barrister by name.

38. It is convenient to consider first the error of law  challenge  in  the
    terms in which it was framed by Designated Judge  Baird  when  granting
    permission, which was to the effect that the judge was at fault in  not
    ensuring that the appellant received a fair hearing.  If such a case is
    made out, it is not  necessary  to  enter  into  the  more  problematic
    territory  of  the  alleged  misconduct  of  the  appellant's  previous
    representatives.

    Judge at fault in failing to adjourn?

39. There was no error of law on the part of the judge in not  agreeing  to
    adjourn the appeal hearing pending the outcome of the appellant's claim
    for  judicial  review.   The  judge  gave  adequate  reasons   in   his
    determination for refusing an adjournment on this basis.

40. It is argued that the judge ought  to  have  adjourned  the  appeal  on
    another ground, which was to enable the Croydon Firm  to  take  witness
    statements from the appellant and family  members  in  support  of  her
    claim under Article 8.  It is argued that the judge was aware that  the
    case had not been properly prepared, as evidenced by his expressions of
    surprise as to the lack of witness statement evidence, and therefore he
    should have ruled that  the  appeal  could  not  be  justly  determined
    without an adjournment.

41. But the judge could not be expected to go behind the position taken  by
    appellant's Counsel.  Mr C did not seek an adjournment  in  order  that
    further evidence could be adduced in support of the  Article  8  claim.
    In any event, the appellant was present in court, as were her  parents,
    who the judge noted were sitting at the back.  So the letter of support
    written by Mr Rogers could have served as their evidence-in-chief,  and
    they could have been tendered for cross-examination.  Mr C elected  not
    to call any evidence, apparently on the basis that it was  self-evident
    that there had been no material change  of  circumstances  since  2011,
    when the appellant had been  granted  discretionary  leave  to  remain,
    despite already being an adult.  This  was  the  sole  basis  on  which
    Counsel argued that the appeal against refusal of  discretionary  leave
    to remain should be allowed.

42. With regard to the Article 8 claim, Counsel's case was that the refusal
    decision represented disproportionate interference with the appellant's
    right to respect for her private life, having regard to her  length  of
    residence in the United Kingdom and her aspirations, and the fact  that
    she should have  been  granted  discretionary  leave  to  remain  under
    legacy.  Alternatively,  the  decision  under  Article  8  was  not  in
    accordance with the law, as her eligibility for leave to  remain  under
    legacy had not been considered.

43. Given the nature of the case that was being advanced on the appellant's
    behalf by Counsel, from the judge's perspective  the  appeal  could  be
    justly determined without an adjournment.

44. Objectively, the case which was being advanced was a very weak  one  on
    the authorities (as it was a pure private life claim) and also  because
    of the lack of evidence underpinning the central assertion  of  Counsel
    that the appellant was independent in 2011,  and  therefore  there  had
    been no material change of circumstances justifying the  appellant  not
    being granted further discretionary leave to remain as  an  independent
    adult.  But it would not have been proper for the judge to descend into
    the arena and inform Counsel that the case which was being advanced was
    unlikely  to  succeed,  still  less  to  adjourn  the  hearing  on  the
    speculative basis that evidence transformative of the appellant's  case
    was available, but had not yet been elicited from the appellant or  her
    parents by Counsel's instructing solicitors.

45. In short, it was in accordance with the overriding  objective  for  the
    judge to proceed with the appeal hearing, once he had justifiably ruled
    against the appellant on the application for an adjournment in order to
    await the outcome of the proceedings for judicial review.

    Material mistakes of fact?

46. Based on what the appellant said in the her witness statement dated  14
    May 2014, Designated Judge Baird was of the view that it  was  arguable
    that the judge had erred in his understanding of the facts of the case,
    with the consequence that his findings were vitiated  by  an  error  of
    law.  This contention does not stand up to scrutiny.  The  judge  fully
    understood the facts of the case, as they were presented to him.

47. At paragraph 38, the judge states that the asylum claim  was  withdrawn
    and was thereby concluded.  If he was  referring  to  a  claim  by  the
    appellant, this may have been an error, as it is not suggested  in  the
    appellant's immigration history that she herself ever  made  an  asylum
    claim.  But in the judicial review documents provided to the  judge  it
    was alleged by the Croydon Firm that the appellant had made  an  asylum
    claim.  So if there is a mistake of fact,  it  is  one  for  which  the
    representatives are responsible.  But in any event it is not a  mistake
    of fact which has  any  bearing  on  the  judge's  conclusions  on  the
    relevance of the legacy claim in the proportionality assessment.

48. The core mistake of fact asserted  by  the  appellant  in  her  witness
    statement is that, contrary to the case  advanced  by  Counsel  at  the
    hearing, she remains  emotionally  and  financially  dependent  on  her
    mother. She also helps care for her stepfather, a British citizen,  who
    has hearing difficulties and has been diagnosed with  cancer;  and  she
    lives with her brother, Isaac Gidudu, who was born on 21  October  1978
    and who has been granted ILR.

49. As none of this was canvassed in the  evidence  before  the  judge,  he
    acted reasonably in determining the appellant's appeal on the  evidence
    that was before him, which was Mr Rogers' letter of support  testifying
    to her independence and the oral evidence which he  elicited  from  the
    appellant on the  topic  of  returning  to  Uganda.  As  this  evidence
    reasonably led to the dismissal of the appeal  under  Rule  276ADE  and
    Article 8, grounds 5 and 6 fall away.

    Procedural Unfairness?

50. I have asked myself  whether  there  has  nonetheless  been  procedural
    unfairness, having  regard  to  the  observations  made  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in paragraph [25] of  MM.   I  answer  this  question  in  the
    negative.  The general Rule remains that the  mistake  of  fact  relied
    upon must not be the responsibility  of  the  appellant  or  the  legal
    advisors.  Moreover, the asserted mistake of fact cannot be said to  be
    uncontroversial or objectively verifiable. What  is  now  said  by  the
    appellant sits uneasily with the picture presented by the  contents  of
    her application for further discretionary leave, the letter of  support
    from Mr Rogers and the grounds of appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    While the latter asserted the appellant's continuing dependency on  her
    mother, the facts relied on pointed in the opposite  direction.  Up  to
    and including the hearing in the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  Article  8
    claim was squarely based on private life and legacy considerations, not
    on the proposition that the appellant at the age of 23 still  had  ties
    to her mother and stepfather which went beyond normal  emotional  ties,
    such that there was continuing family life between  parents  and  child
    for the purposes of Article 8.

51. Accordingly, I am not persuaded  that  the  appellant  is  entitled  to
    relief on MM grounds from the  alleged  incompetence  of  her  previous
    solicitors, in their preparations for  the  hearing,  and  the  alleged
    incompetence of her barrister in the conduct of the hearing.

Decision

52. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  contain  an  error  of
    law, and accordingly the decision stands.
