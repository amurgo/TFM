For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

This is the re-making decision in the appeal of Mr Sunuwar ("the
Appellant") against the Respondent's refusal of his human rights claim made
by way of an application for entry clearance to join his father ("the
Sponsor") and stepmother in the United Kingdom.

The Appellant is the son of a former Gurkha soldier.  This re-making
decision follows my previous error of law decision, promulgated on 15 June
2021, by which I found that the First-tier Tribunal had materially erred in
law in respect of its finding that family life between the Appellant and
the Sponsor did not exist.  The error of law decision is annexed to this re-
making decision.

In re-making the decision in this case I have taken full account of the
evidence contained in the Appellant's consolidated bundle, indexed and
paginated 1-187 and that contained in the Respondent's original appeal
bundle.  The Sponsor was called to give brief oral evidence.  He adopted
his two witness statements dated 9 July 2021 and 20 May 2020.  There was no
cross-examination.



Submissions

By way of submissions, Ms Everett, in her customary fair and realistic
manner, made no challenge to the truthfulness of the Sponsor's evidence.
She submitted that whilst the Entry Clearance Officer might have been
correct to have refused the human rights claim in the first instance, there
was now additional evidence before me, none of which was being challenged.

Mr Ahmed relied on his helpful skeleton argument which included numerous
references to the Appellant's consolidated bundle.  He submitted that the
evidence demonstrated continuing family life between the Appellant and the
Sponsor.  It disclosed that there was both emotional and financial
dependency and, in the words of the relevant case-law, the support was
"real", "committed" and "effective".  Mr Ahmed submitted that once family
life was found to exist the question of proportionality was well-settled.
The historic injustice perpetrated against former Gurkha soldiers was in
effect a decisive factor in the Appellant's favour.



Re-making the decision

At the end of the hearing I announced to the parties that I would be
allowing the Appellant's appeal on the basis that I found family life to
exist and that it would be disproportionate to prevent the Appellant from
re-joining his father in the United Kingdom.  I now set out my reasons for
these conclusions.

The first point to be made is that none of the evidence before me has been
challenged by the Respondent.  It is clear that there was a family life
between the Appellant and his father when the two lived together as part of
a family unit in Nepal prior to the Sponsor coming to the United Kingdom to
settle in 2010.  I am satisfied that at that time and if it had been open
to the family, the Sponsor had intended for the family unit to remain
together, in other words that the Appellant would have accompanied the
Sponsor to this country for settlement.

Considering the evidence as a whole, with particular reference to the items
flagged up by Mr Ahmed at paragraph 27(a)-(m) of his skeleton argument, it
is plain that there has been continuing emotional and financial dependency
by the Appellant on the Sponsor.  There is evidence of frequent
communications by various means and of the provision of financial support.
I am satisfied that the financial support has gone to meet the Appellant's
essential living needs.

I also accept that the concerns as to the lack of evidence which I
expressed in my error of law decision have been credibly addressed by the
Sponsor at paragraph 5 of his most recent witness statement.

I conclude that the evidence does, as Mr Ahmed submitted, disclose "real",
"committed" and "effective" support provided by the Sponsor to the
Appellant on an ongoing basis.  Applying this factual matrix to the
relevant case-law including, but not limited to Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 30, I
find that there is family life for the purposes of Article 8(1).

I turn then to the question of proportionality under Article 8(2).
Applying the well-known jurisprudence including Ghising No 2
(Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic wrong; weight (Nepal) [2013] UKUT 567 (IAC) , Rai
(supra), and what is said in Patel (historic injustice; NIAA Part 5A)
[2020] UKUT 351(IAC), I conclude that the historic injustice factor is of
such significant weight as to tip the balance in the Appellant's favour,
notwithstanding the important public interest in maintaining effective
immigration control and all other matters arising under section 117B of the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as amended.

It follows that the Appellant's appeal succeeds on the basis that the
Respondent's refusal of his human rights claim constituted a
disproportionate interference with his family life and is therefore
unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.




Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law and that decision has been set aside.

I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have,  in  all  the  circumstances,
decided to make a full fee award of ï¿½140.00.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Shrestha, Solicitor from Castle Street Chambers
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Andrew ("the judge"), promulgated on 12 November 2020, by which she
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's refusal of
    his human rights claim made by way of an application for entry
    clearance to join his father and stepmother in the United Kingdom.  The
    Appellant is the son of a former Gurkha soldier.  On appeal to the
    First-tier Tribunal the central issue was whether there existed family
    life between the Appellant and his father and stepmother in this
    country.

The judge referred herself to relevant authorities, including Rai [2017]
EWCA Civ 320.  She initially concluded that there had been family life
between the Appellant and his father whilst the latter had resided in
Nepal.  However, the judge went on to find that "matters have moved on -
not only with the passage of time."  The judge relied on a previous
decision of the First-tier Tribunal from 2017 in which a judge had
concluded that the Appellant's "real family life" had been with his
brother, who continued to reside in Nepal.  Judge Andrew relied on this
previous finding in her decision.  In addition, she found that the
Appellant's apparent plans to try and seek work in the Far East indicated
that there was no longer family life between him and his father.  Further,
the judge noted the absence of significant evidence of dependency.
Ultimately she concluded that there was no family life between the
Appellant and his father (and stepmother) and accordingly dismissed the
appeal without going on to consider the question of proportionality.

The grounds of appeal put forward a number of challenges, including the
assertion that the judge had erred in respect of the family life issue.  In
granting permission, Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Shaerf noted that
family life could exist in different forms and with different people at the
same time.  In addition, he regarded as arguable the contention that a plan
or intention to seek work in the Far East was not an indication that family
life had been broken.

On 18 January 2021 the Respondent served a rule 24 response stating that
the Appellant's appeal was "not opposed."  At the hearing, Ms Everett
confirmed that this remained the Respondent's position.  She accepted that
the judge had erred in her assessment of the family life issue.

I indicated to the parties that this accorded with my preliminary view in
respect of the judge's finding that family life did not exist.  Whether or
not there was family life between the Appellant and his brother in Nepal
was not indicative of the absence of family life between the Appellant and
his family in the United Kingdom.  I agree with Judge Shaerf's observation
that family life can indeed exist between different people in different
places at the same time.  I also agree with his view as to the Appellant's
apparent plans to seek work in the Far East.  On the evidence before the
judge, these were just that; plans which had not yet been executed.  Again,
this factor did not go to show that any family life that had previously
existed had been broken for this reason alone.

The essential error arising from the judge's approach was that she failed
to adequately assess the nature of the claimed relationship between the
Appellant and his father, seen in the context of the existence of family
life when the two last lived together in Nepal.  With respect, the judge
appeared to have allowed herself to be distracted by the presence of the
brother in Nepal and the Appellant's hope that he might be able to obtain
employment in the Far East at some point.

I do share some of the concerns of the judge in respect of the lack of
detailed documentary evidence as regards the issue of dependency,
particularly relating to financial matters.  However, in all the
circumstances I am satisfied that the judge materially erred in law on the
family life issue.

I exercise my discretion and set the judge's decision aside.

In terms of disposal, I see no need to remit this case to the First-tier
Tribunal.  Relevant fact-finding can be undertaken in the Upper Tribunal.
This will be done through a resumed hearing, to be conducted remotely.
Directions to progress the case are set out below.

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity direction and nor do I.
