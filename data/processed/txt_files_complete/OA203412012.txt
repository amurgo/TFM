                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Jacobs-Jones, promulgated on  12  July  2013,
    following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 5 July 2013, whereby  the  judge
    allowed Mrs Ambalavanar's appeal against the Entry Clearance  Officer's
    decision refusing her application for settlement in order to  join  her
    son, a British citizen, in the UK.  For  ease  of  reference,  I  shall
    refer throughout this decision to the Entry Clearance Officer, who  was
    the original respondent, as "the ECO" and to Mrs  Ambalavanr,  who  was
    the original appellant, as "the claimant".

 2. The claimant, who is a citizen on Sri Lanka born on 26 January 1945, is
    a widow, and applied under  paragraph  317(iv)(a)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules to join her children in the UK.  The ECO refused her  application
    because he considered that the claimant had not  established  that  the
    maintenance requirements under the Rules had been satisfied.

 3. The claimant appealed against this decision and as already  noted,  her
    appeal was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. In her determination, Judge Jacobs-Jones made findings that in addition
    to financial support from the main sponsor, the claimant would also  be
    supported by her other son.  She  considered  that  genuine  offers  of
    financial assistance from third parties could  be  taken  into  account
    "with  a  view  to  assessing  whether  the  cumulative  income   would
    adequately maintain" the claimant, and found that it would.

 5. The basis of the ECO's appeal was  that  this  aspect  of  the  judge's
    findings was not adequately reasoned, because the judge had  not  given
    any consideration to the expenses of the third  parties  who  would  be
    providing support.  It was recognised (at paragraph 4 of  the  grounds)
    that the "ultimate  decision  may  have  been   correct",  but  without
    adequate reasoning, the decision could not stand.

The Hearing

 6. I heard submissions on  behalf  of  both  parties,  and  I  also  heard
    evidence subsequently from four witnesses,  all  of  whom  were  cross-
    examined.    I   recorded   the   submissions    and    the    evidence
    contemporaneously, and as these notes are contained  in  my  Record  of
    Proceedings I shall not set out below everything which was said  during
    the course of the hearing.  I have, however,  had  regard  to  all  the
    submissions and all the evidence, as  well  as  to  all  the  documents
    contained within the file, when reaching my decision.

Error of Law

 7. Having heard submissions on behalf of both  parties,  I  was  satisfied
    that the judge's determination had contained a material error  of  law,
    such that the decision would have to be  remade.   The  judge  had  not
    considered what expenses the  claimant's  children  would  have  before
    concluding that they would be able to provide third party  support.  In
    those circumstances, her finding that there would be  adequate  support
    available could not stand.

 8. I then heard evidence  from  the  claimant's  two  sons  and  also  her
    daughter and son-in-law.  While the evidence of the claimant's two sons
    was unsatisfactory, because they were unable to provide a  satisfactory
    breakdown of their expenses, I was nonetheless satisfied that they were
    each providing some support towards their mother at present, and  would
    continue to do so.

 9. Notwithstanding my reservations as to these witnesses, however,  I  was
    very impressed with the evidence of both the  claimant's  daughter  and
    son-in-law, which I shall summarise briefly.  They  are  both  working,
    and most of their household expenses were paid by  the  son-in-law,  Mr
    Alex Nirmalanantha, who earned about �20,000 a year net.  His wife, the
    claimant's daughter, Mrs Sivasakthy Nirmalantha, had a basic income  of
    �1,077.93 a month gross,  but  usually  earned  much  more  than  that,
    because she worked overtime.  She produced payslips which  showed  that
    her monthly net income varied from about �900 to �1,400 a  month.   Her
    bank statement showed a  healthy balance  of  around  �4,000.   It  was
    always  substantially  in  credit.   Given  that  all  the  substantial
    outgoings of the household were paid by the  claimant's  son-in-law,  I
    accept their evidence that between them they would be able to  provide,
    if required, up to �400 per month to support the claimant were  she  to
    come here, and I also accept their evidence that they would be  willing
    to do so.

10. On behalf of the ECO, Mr Ouseley accepted that the only issue which was
    now live was whether or not the maintenance requirement was  satisfied,
    and that the claimant would have to establish only that there would  be
    �311 per month available for her maintenance over and  above  what  her
    children currently spent.  Mr Ouseley accepted that if the Tribunal was
    satisfied on the evidence which  had  been  given  that  this  sum  was
    available, then the appeal should be allowed.  Mr Ouseley also accepted
    that it would be open to the Tribunal to make a finding that  this  sum
    was available.

11. Having heard the evidence, and  in  particular   the  evidence  of  the
    claimant's daughter and son-in-law, I  am  entirely  satisfied  on  the
    balance of probabilities that the necessary sums are available and were
    available for the maintenance of the claimant as at  the  date  of  the
    decision, and it therefore follows that this appeal  must  be  allowed,
    and I so find.

Decision

I set aside the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  as  containing  a
material error of law, and substitute the following decision:

The claimant's appeal is allowed, under the Immigration Rules.




Signed:                                 Date: 20 November 2013
