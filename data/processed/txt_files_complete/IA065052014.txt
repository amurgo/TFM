Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P. Mason, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Allen, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, born on 18 February 1985, is a citizen of Pakistan.

 2. No anonymity direction has been previously made  in  these  proceedings
    and no reason has been put before me for such an order to be made.

 3. The appellant applied on 25 October 2013 for indefinite leave to remain
    in the United Kingdom on the basis of domestic violence under  Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended).  Her application  was
    refused by the respondent following a decision on 14 January 2014.  The
    respondent was not satisfied the appellant's application satisfied  the
    eligibility requirements for leave on that basis under Appendix FM  and
    also was not satisfied that the appellant could qualify for leave under
    any other part of Appendix FM or under Rule 276ADE of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. The appellant appealed that decision.  Following a  hearing  at  Hatton
    Cross, Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Miles,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 23 July 2014, dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 5. On 11 August 2014, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P. J. G. White gave
    permission to the appellant to appeal.  His reasons for so doing were:-

         "1.  The Appellant seeks permission to appeal, in time,  against  a
             decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Miles  who,  in   a
             determination promulgated  on  23 July  2014,  dismissed  the
             Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse
             to grant leave to remain.

         2.   Having had regard to the grounds for permission to appeal  and
             the  determination,  I  am  satisfied  that  in  reaching  his
             decision the judge arguably made  an  error  of  law  for  the
             following reasons:-

             a.   It is arguable that the judge gave inadequate reasons for
                  stating  that  the  situation  facing  the  Appellant   in
                  Pakistan on return did not amount to 'persecution'/Article
                  3 ill-treatment (page 11).

             b.   It is arguable that the judge gave inadequate reasons for
                  rejecting the expert evidence produced on  behalf  of  the
                  Appellant (page 10).

             c.   The judge made  no  findings  in  regard  to  Article  8,
                  notwithstanding that issue was raised in  the  grounds  of
                  appeal and in Counsel's written skeleton argument.

         3.   Accordingly I am satisfied that the grounds and  determination
             disclose an arguable error of law."

 6. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 7. In making his submissions  Mr  Mason  relied  on  the  written  grounds
    seeking permission to appeal which he duly expanded in oral argument.

 8. So far as ground 1 is concerned, Mr Mason submits that the judge  erred
    in failing  to  undertake  a  subjective  assessment  of  the  risk  of
    persecution and in  failing  to  consider  whether  being  shunned  and
    ostracised could reach the persecution threshold,  that  he  failed  to
    take account of the appellant's subjective fear,  rejected  the  expert
    evidence without giving adequate reasons and made mistakes of fact  and
    speculated with regard to the evidence of  the  appellant's  counsellor
    and thereby committed a procedural irregularity.  So far as the  second
    ground is concerned, he submitted that the judge failed to undertake an
    assessment of the other  aspects  of  the  appellant's  appeal,  namely
    Article 8 under the 1950 Convention and whether the decision was not in
    accordance  with  the  law,  thereby  rendering  the  judge's  decision
    "materially flawed".

 9. Mr Allen in making his submissions observed that  firstly  the  judge's
    determination is a complex one to follow.  In  essence  the  judge  has
    relied on country guidance authorities which he is entitled to do.   In
    particular KA and Others (domestic violence) Pakistan  CG  [2010]  UKUT
    216 and SN & HM (Divorced women, risk on  return)  Pakistan  CG  [2004]
    UKIAT 00283.  Albeit this appellant had only undergone the nikah and an
    Islamic divorce, that did not distinguish her case such that the  judge
    erred in his reliance upon KA.  The judge has taken  into  account  the
    appellant's fears and it was open to him, for  the  reasons  given,  to
    reject the expert evidence.  There is no speculation  as  asserted  and
    the appellant's protection claims have been properly examined prior  to
    their rejection.

10. Beyond that, contrary to Mr Mason's oral submissions, it  was  recorded
    in the appellant's Counsel's skeleton argument prepared for the  First-
    tier hearing that it was "accepted that the immigration decision is  in
    accordance with the law on a reading of the rule" and to now  say  that
    it is not on the basis that the "spirit" of the  Rule  is  an  argument
    which misses the point.  The point being that the  judge  was  to  deal
    with the Immigration Rules themselves.

11. Finally, whilst the judge may  have  erred  in  not  dealing  with  the
    Article 8 issue this cannot be  a  material  error  in  the  particular
    circumstances of this appellant.

12. I find that in considering the issues in this appeal it would have been
    of considerable assistance had the judge applied numbered paragraphs to
    his determination.

13. The appellant is a victim of domestic violence who claims she  will  be
    at real risk of serious harm should she be returned to Pakistan because
    she has left her fianc�, to whom she was  a  wife  consequent  upon  an
    Islamic marriage, by reason of his domestic violence toward her.

14. The factual matrix is one of an appellant who travelled to  the  United
    Kingdom on a fianc� visa valid from 29 April 2013 until 29  October  of
    the same year.  She married Khalid Gul in an Islamic ceremony on 24 May
    2013 which was on the day of her arrival.  That marriage broke down  as
    a result of domestic violence on 11 August 2013 and on  25  October  of
    the same year she made application for indefinite leave to remain.   In
    short, her case is that she cannot return to her husband by  reason  of
    his domestic violence toward her, nor can she return to Pakistan  as  a
    divorc�e.  Her husband and family have a history of violence which  she
    fears as  she  will  have  been  considered  to  have  dishonoured  her
    husband's family by leaving him;  and  accordingly  her  safety  within
    Pakistan cannot be guaranteed.  The appellant  argues  that  she  is  a
    member of a particular social group who by reason of the factual matrix
    of her claim is entitled to asylum and protection under Articles 2  and
    3 of the 1950 Convention.

15. I find the judge took proper account of all issues in relation to  such
    claims and throughout his determination has plainly  engaged  with  the
    totality of the evidence the appellant  put  forward.   He  found  that
    whilst many of the central facts of the appellant's claim are  disputed
    in relation to what occurred following the appellant's entry  into  the
    United Kingdom, what is clear is that a religious marriage  took  place
    on the day of her arrival and that she was subsequently  successful  in
    obtaining a divorce from the Sharia  Council  in  London.   Whilst  the
    appellant has never claimed to have been physically  assaulted  in  the
    time that she was living with her husband and  his  family,  the  judge
    found that there was a degree of hostility towards her from her  former
    husband and family.  The judge properly reminded himself of the  burden
    and standard of proof.  The judge took account of the expert  evidence.
    Ultimately though he was entitled to make findings of fact  as  to  the
    level of threat the appellant faced either in the United Kingdom or  in
    Pakistan were she to be returned there.  The judge clearly analysed the
    expert evidence and set it into the context  of  the  totality  of  the
    evidence that was considered before reaching his conclusions  that  the
    appellant would not be at  risk  of  either  persecution  or  treatment
    contrary to Article 3 were she to be returned to her home country.

16. The judge has clearly  engaged  with  the  expert  evidence  and  given
    adequate reasons for his conclusions in relation to it.  In so doing he
    has explained, again with reasons, why he prefers the analysis  in  the
    country guidance of KA to that of one of the experts here.  He was also
    entitled to come to his conclusion that one of the experts (Mrs Moeen)
    was in error in her assertions that  there  was  no  possible  part  of
    Pakistan to which this particular appellant could not be identified  by
    her  ex-husband's  family.   The  judge  gave  adequate   reasons   for
    concluding that  the  appellant's  husband  and  family  simply  wanted
    nothing more to do with her rather than  making  specific  attempts  to
    target her if she were to be returned.

17. The judge has properly considered the  evidence  of  the  experts  and,
    contrary to the asserted grounds, has applied anxious scrutiny to  this
    appeal.   To  assert  that  the  judge  should  have  found  that  this
    particular appellant held  such  fears  that  it  should  override  the
    objective analysis that relocation is reasonable is, in  light  of  the
    judge's determination, no more than  a  disagreement  with  conclusions
    that were open to be  made.   Page  11  of  the  judge's  determination
    provides clear reasons as to why the judge  felt  able  to  reject  the
    concluding evidence of the appellant's two expert witnesses.

18. Ultimately the judge had to decide whether the appellant could meet the
    requirements of the domestic violence provisions within the Immigration
    Rules.  She could not.  Even  in  the  appellant's  Counsel's  skeleton
    argument for the First-tier Tribunal hearing it was accepted  that  the
    immigration decision was in  accordance  with  the  law.   I  find  the
    respondent's approach to this case not to be flawed as  asserted.   The
    judge's conclusions in relation to the  inability  of  this  particular
    appellant being able to meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
    flows from the findings made in relation to the appellant's eligibility
    for indefinite leave to remain as a victim of domestic violence and  in
    particular the exclusion therein of a fianc�e.  In the circumstances of
    this appeal the "spirit" of any respondent policy  is  subsumed  within
    the Rules themselves.

19. As to the Article 8 ground, it has to be said that the  issue  was  not
    dealt with within the determination as has  been  submitted.   However,
    there is a reality to this particular appellant's  circumstances.   She
    has been unable  to  meet  the  domestic  violence  provisions  in  the
    Immigration Rules and likewise the Immigration Rules so far  as  family
    and private life is concerned.   Counsel's  skeleton  argument  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal argued that it was incumbent upon the  Tribunal  to
    undertake an assessment of all the exceptional factors "i.e.  an  [sic]
    proportionality assessment".  In making this argument at paragraph  26,
    Counsel was relying on the authority of MF (Article  8  -  new  Rules)
    Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393  (IAC).   Having  been  unable  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, even if  the  appellant's  claim
    fell to be considered under Article 8 the factual matrix here  is  such
    that the appellant's claim would not succeed as  there  is  little,  if
    anything, to  put  on  her  side  of  the  balancing  exercise  in  any
    proportionality assessment.  The judge's error in failing to deal  with
    Article 8 cannot therefore be said to be material.

20. In all the circumstances the conclusions of the judge were open to  him
    to be made on the evidence that was before him.  Adequate reasoning has
    been provided  which  takes  proper  account  of  the  appellant's  own
    evidence and sets it into  the  context  of  the  background  material,
    taking into account relevant country guidance case law.

21. The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law and I do not set it aside but order  that  the  decision
    shall stand.
