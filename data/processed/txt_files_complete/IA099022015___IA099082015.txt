Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr M Bhutyan, Haque & Hausman Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant and his dependent wife are both  citizens  of  Bangladesh
    born respectively on 31st December 1983  and  1st  January  1992.   The
    Appellants' appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse to grant
    residence cards as confirmation of  a  right  of  residence  under  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Malins in a decision dated 27th February 2016.

2.   Permission was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Lindsley  on  14th
    September 2016 on the ground that it was arguable that  the  judge  had
    failed to make material findings  and  her  conclusions  were  arguably
    unreasoned and irrational. It was arguably erroneous to have required a
    dependency of necessity between the Appellant and the Sponsor following
    Lim (EEA - dependency) [2013] UKUT 00437.

3.   The matter came before me after the promulgation  of  the  decision  in
    Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC) in which the Upper
    Tribunal held that there was no statutory right of appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State refusing to grant a  residence  card
    to a person claiming to be an extended family member.

4.   In submissions Mr Bhutyan stated that there was an appeal to the  Court
    of Appeal against this decision and therefore any findings made against
    the Appellant in the First-tier Tribunal should not be held against him
    in relation to future applications.

Discussion and Conclusions

5.   Regulation 2 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 states  that  an
    "EEA decision" means a decision under these Regulations that concerns -
    .... (a) to (b)... but does not include a decision to refuse to issue a
    document under regulation 12(4) (issue of an EEA family  permit  to  an
    extended family member), 17(5) (issue of a registration certificate  to
    an extended family member) or 18(4) (issue of a residence  card  to  an
    extended family member).

6.   I find that following the decision of  Sala,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge erred in law  in  hearing  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
    refusal of a residence card as an extended family member.  She  had  no
    jurisdiction to hear the appeal. I therefore find that she has erred in
    law in failing to dismiss the appeal for want of  jurisdiction.  I  set
    aside her decision dated 27th February  2016  and  promulgated  on  2nd
    March 2016 and remake it as follows: The appeal is dismissed  for  want
    of jurisdiction. None of the judge's findings are preserved.

7.   The Appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed insofar as  the
    First-tier Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear his appeal. The judge's
    findings and decision are set aside.



Notice of Decision

The Appellant's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is  allowed  insofar  as  the
First-tier Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
