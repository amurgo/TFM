Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Babarinde of Hatten Wyatt Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Nigerian national who was born  on  27  April  1990.
    She appeals against a decision which was issued by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Widdup on 27  March  2019,  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    respondent's refusal of her human rights claim.

Background

 2. The appellant entered the UK as a student in 2013 and was  subsequently
    granted further leave to remain until February  2015.   She  overstayed
    upon the expiry of that  leave  and,  in  October  2017,  she  made  an
    application  for  leave  to  remain  on  human  rights  grounds.    Her
    representatives stated in the application that she was the partner of a
    Nigerian national named [LO] and that they  were  the  parents  of  two
    children named [JnO] and [JlO], who were born in the UK  on  15  August
    2014 and 12 January 2017.  Mr [O] was said to  be  a  Nigeria  national
    with a retained right to reside in the  United  Kingdom  following  the
    termination of his marriage to an  EEA  national.   The  children  were
    nationals of Nigeria.  It was  submitted  that  the  first  appellant's
    length of residence and the best interests of the  children  outweighed
    the public interest in  immigration  control  and  that  the  appellant
    should be granted leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 3. The respondent refused the application on 15 August 2018.  He concluded
    there was no evidence to show that the appellant and Mr [O]  had  lived
    together for the two years preceding the application or  to  show  that
    their relationship was genuine and subsisting.  Nor  did  Mr  [O]  have
    British citizenship or a form of status which enabled him to sponsor an
    application under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The  appellant
    could not succeed under the Partner Route for those reasons and, in any
    event, there was no reason to think that the relationships in  question
    could not continue in Nigeria.  The appellant had not  shown  that  she
    had sole responsibility for her children and was unable  to  show  that
    she should succeed under the Parent Route either.  It was not  accepted
    that there would be very significant obstacles  to  the  appellant  re-
    integrating into Nigeria or that there were  exceptional  circumstances
    outside the Immigration Rules which justified a decision to grant leave
    to remain on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appellant appealed and her appeal came before Judge Widdup, sitting
    at Hatton Cross, on 19 March 2019.  She was represented at that hearing
    by Mr Babarinde, as she was before me.

 5. The case advanced before Judge Widdup on  the  appellant's  behalf  was
    focused principally on [JnO], who had by that stage been recognised  to
    have Special Education Needs.  Evidence was adduced to show that  [JnO]
    had Global Development Delay,  social  communication  difficulties  and
    traits of ASD - Autistic Spectrum Disorder - and had been placed on his
    primary school's SEN register.  It was also submitted that Mr  [O]  had
    lived with the appellant since November 2016 and that he would  shortly
    be eligible for Permanent Residence ("PR").

 6. The appellant was called to give evidence before Judge Widdup.  Mr  [O]
    did not attend, although he had made a witness statement.  His  absence
    was attributed to an assertion  that  only  a  parent  was  allowed  to
    collect [JnO] from Primary School as a result of  his  diagnoses.   The
    Presenting Officer is recorded as having told the judge that  Mr  [O]'s
    'most recent application had been  refused'  but  that  submission  was
    wrongly recorded by the judge.  As Mr Babarinde  confirmed  before  me,
    the Presenting Officer had actually stated that consideration was being
    given to revoking Mr [O]'s EEA Residence Card.  The Presenting  Officer
    also handed up - without objection or  application  on  Mr  Babarinde's
    part - a report dated 6 June 2018 about the availability in Nigeria  of
    treatment for children with autism.

 7. Having considered the oral  and  written  evidence  before  him,  Judge
    Widdup concluded that Mr [O] had been issued with a residence  card  as
    an individual who had retained a right to reside in  the  UK  following
    the termination of his marriage: [30].  That card  was  valid  from  28
    September 2017 to 28 September 2022.

 8. Judge Widdup considered and did not accept the explanation given for Mr
    [O]'s absence from the hearing: [31].  He considered there to  be  very
    little evidence of Mr [O]'s right to reside under the EEA  Regulations.
    There was no evidence about his former marriage to an EEA  national  or
    his claim to have resided in the UK for five years in  compliance  with
    the EEA Regulations: [32]. There was a lack of evidence  of  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship and there was no  satisfactory  explanation
    for his absence from the hearing:  [33]-[34].   The  judge  accordingly
    attached little weight to Mr [O]'s witness statement and concluded that
    the appellant had not discharged the burden of proving that she enjoyed
    a genuine and subsisting relationship with him: [35].

 9. The judge turned to  consider  [JnO]'s  best  interests  at  [37].   He
    described that issue as 'the main issue in the appeal'.  He noted  that
    the appellant was accepted by Mr Babarinde to have no claim  under  the
    Immigration Rules, whether in reliance on her claimed relationship with
    Mr [O] or with the children.   The  appeal  was  argued  purely  on  an
    Article 8 ECHR basis outside the Immigration Rules:  [39].   The  judge
    considered Article 8 ECHR to  be  engaged  and  proceeded  to  consider
    whether  the  respondent's   decision   represented   a   proportionate
    interference with those rights.  He began that assessment by  assessing
    the best interests of the children, and [JnO] in particular.

10. The judge noted that the children were Nigerian nationals and  that  it
    was in their best interests that they continue to be brought up by  the
    appellant and to  maintain  a  relationship  with  their  father.   The
    appellant and the children would be returned to  Nigeria  together  and
    if,  contrary  to  his  primary  finding,  the  appellant  was   in   a
    relationship with Mr [O], he might be able to  support  an  application
    for entry clearance made by all three of them: [43]-[46].

11. Judge Widdup considered the evidence relating to [JnO]'s diagnosis  and
    his particular needs: [47]-[49].  He considered the evidence adduced by
    the respondent about the care which might be available in Nigeria.   He
    considered, in light of that evidence,  that  there  was  some  support
    available but he was unable to make any findings  in  relation  to  the
    ease with which  it  could  be  obtained,  or  whether  it  was  widely
    available:  [51]-[52].   He  noted  that  the   respondent's   evidence
    indicated that such children might be  stigmatised  or  thought  to  be
    possessed in Nigeria: [52].

12. In all the circumstances, the judge considered that it was  in  [JnO]'s
    best interests to continue to receive  the  support  and  treatment  he
    received in the UK. He went on to consider, however, whether those best
    interests  were  outweighed  by  the  public  interest  in  immigration
    control, as manifested in s117B of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.  Having  undertaken  a  balancing  exercise  over  the
    course of [54]-[65], the  judge  concluded  that  the  public  interest
    outweighed the considerations on the appellant's side  of  the  balance
    sheet, including [JnO]'s best interests.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

13. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  on  grounds  which  may  be
    summarised as follows.  Firstly,  that  the  judge  had  erred  in  not
    treating the  child's  best  interests  as  paramount  and  failing  to
    consider cases such as JO  (Nigeria)  [2014]  UKUT  517  (IAC)  and  EV
    (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ 874.  Secondly, that the judge had  erred
    in relying on an 'unknown publication' when concluding that  there  was
    some treatment available in Nigeria for  [JnO].   Thirdly,  that  'more
    weight' should have been given  to  the  reasons  given  for  Mr  [O]'s
    attendance.  Fourthly, that Mr [O] would be  entitled  to  PR  and  the
    judge had been wrong to conclude otherwise.  Fifthly,  that  the  judge
    had failed, in considering  the  public  interest  in  the  appellant's
    removal, to consider the effect of administrative delay in light of  EB
    (Kosovo) 2008 UKHL 41; [2009] 1 AC 1159.

14. Having been refused permission to appeal by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    the appellant was granted permission on renewal by Upper Tribunal Judge
    Lindsley.

Submissions

15. Before  me,  Mr  [O]  focused  his  submissions  on  [JnO]'s  position,
    submitting that the  judge  had  misdirected  himself  in  law  in  his
    consideration  of  the  child's   best   interests   and   had   relied
    impermissibly on the background material provided  by  the  respondent.
    Mr Babarinde did not seek to develop the points  made  about  Mr  [O]'s
    status in the UK to any real extent, since Mr [O]'s residence card  had
    subsequently been revoked by the respondent and an appeal was  pending,
    to be heard in October 2019.  He submitted that [JnO]'s best  interests
    had not been properly considered and that the judge  had  not  reasoned
    his conclusions adequately.  He submitted that Mr [O] might  have  been
    entitled to PR at the date of hearing because he  had  been  granted  a
    residence card in 2014 and a retained residence  card  in  2017.   Some
    payslips had been before Judge Widdup showing that he had continued  to
    be economically active thereafter.

16. Ms Everett submitted that Judge Widdup had not erred in  law.   He  had
    directed himself appropriately on the evidence and had been entitled to
    conclude that there would be some support for [JnO] in Nigeria.  He had
    accepted that he could not, on the evidence before  him,  come  to  any
    conclusion about the extent of that support and he  had  also  accepted
    that [JnO] may encounter stigma in Nigeria.  Ultimately, however, these
    matters were all carefully factored into the Article 8  assessment  and
    the judge was entitled to conclude that the public interest  outweighed
    those matters which militated  in  the  appellant's  favour,  including
    [JnO]'s best interests.  The conclusion the judge had reached about the
    appellant's relationship with Mr [O] was clearly open to him,  and  the
    assertion that he was unable to attend the hearing because  he  had  to
    collect [JnO] from school was inadequate.  The reasoning was sound  and
    the decision should be upheld.

17. Mr Babarinde emphasised in response that the main issue was the  impact
    of removal on [JnO].

18. I indicated at the end of the hearing that I  did  not  consider  Judge
    Widdup's decision to be erroneous in law and that it  would  stand.   I
    reserved the reasons for that decision, which are as follows.

Discussion

19. I deal firstly  with  the  points  upon  which  Mr  Babarinde  did  not
    particularly focus.  The first concerns  the  judge's  approach  to  Mr
    [O]'s non-attendance at the hearing.  It was submitted in  the  grounds
    that more weight should have been given to the assertion that he  could
    not attend the hearing because he had to collect [JnO] from school.  In
    my judgment, Judge Widdup was perfectly entitled to be concerned  about
    this assertion.  The appellant and Mr [O] lived in Ashford at the  time
    of the hearing before the FtT.  The hearing was in Hatton Cross,  as  I
    have recorded.  There was no documentary evidence to show that  only  a
    parent could collect [JnO] from school.  And there was  no  application
    for the case to be heard first in the list so that Mr [O] could  return
    to Ashford from Feltham.  The judge was  therefore  presented  with  an
    appeal in which there was no  satisfactory  explanation  for  Mr  [O]'s
    absence.  He was entitled to consider that his absence from the hearing
    militated  against  the  establishment  of  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship, particularly when there was a lack of cogent  documentary
    evidence to show that the appellant and this gentleman were in a  long-
    term relationship.  It is to be recalled that the  Secretary  of  State
    had doubted whether the relationship was genuine  and  subsisting;  the
    absence of further evidence,  and  the  absence  of  Mr  [O]  from  the
    hearing, was to be considered against that backdrop.

20. The judge's conclusions about Mr [O]'s status were equally open to him.
     Although I was shown a copy of a residence card which  was  issued  in
    2014, that card was seemingly not shown to Judge Widdup.  He was  shown
    a copy of a card which was said to have been granted in  2017,  on  the
    basis that Mr  [O]  had  retained  a  right  to  reside  following  the
    termination of his marriage to an EEA national.  As confirmed by SSWP v
    Dias [2011] 3 CMLR 40, however, such  a  card  is  declaratory  of  the
    underlying right and the judge was entitled to consider what there  was
    before him to establish that Mr [O] had established a right  to  reside
    permanently in the United Kingdom.  He was entitled  to  conclude,  for
    the reasons that he gave, that there was insufficient to establish such
    a right.

21. There was reference in the grounds of appeal to  the  principle  in  EB
    (Kosovo) that administrative delay might reduce  the  weight  which  is
    otherwise to be attached  to  the  maintenance  of  proper  immigration
    control.  That point was rightly not developed by Mr Babarinde  orally.
    There was no undue delay in this case on the part of the respondent.

22. Judge Lindsley was concerned when granting permission that Judge Widdup
    had  not  considered  the  appellant's  private  life  under  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.  It is correct that  the  judge
    did  not  consider  whether  the  appellant   would   experience   very
    significant obstacles to her re-integration to Nigeria.  But, as I have
    recorded above, that was not part of Mr Babarinde's case; he  expressly
    stated before Judge Widdup that he did  not  rely  on  the  Immigration
    Rules.

23. Mr Babarinde's main complaint was that Judge Widdup had  failed  either
    to undertake a lawful consideration of [JnO]'s best interests  or  that
    he had failed to accord proper weight to those interests  in  balancing
    the competing considerations under Article 8  ECHR.   In  my  judgment,
    neither of those grounds is made out.

24. Mr Babarinde criticises  Judge  Widdup  for  attaching  weight  to  the
    background material  provided  by  the  Presenting  Officer  about  the
    treatment for autism in Nigeria.  Repeating  the  submissions  he  made
    before the judge, he submitted that the information (which is contained
    in a Home Office Response to Country Information Request) may not  have
    reflected the  position  accurately,  not  least  because  the  charity
    described in the document  might  have  had  a  financial  interest  in
    presenting itself in a particular way.  I consider that it was open  to
    the judge to attach weight to this report, particularly when there  was
    no other evidence before him about the treatment may be able to  access
    in Nigeria.  His approach to the report was demonstrably balanced,  and
    he noted that there  was  no  indication  about  the  extent  to  which
    treatment would be available, just as he noted that  there  was  stigma
    attached to children with ASD in Nigeria.

25. The judge concluded that it would  be  in  [JnO]'s  best  interests  to
    remain in the UK to continue to receive  the  specialist  support  from
    which he benefits at the moment.  Contrary to the submissions  made  by
    Mr Babarinde and to the grounds of  appeal,  that  conclusion  was  not
    determinative of the appeal.  These were not proceedings in the  Family
    Court and [JnO]'s best interests were not the paramount  consideration;
    they were instead a primary consideration, which is a consideration  of
    substantial importance.  There  is  no  suggestion  in  Judge  Widdup's
    decision that he treated [JnO]'s best interests as anything other  than
    that.  As a judge in a specialist Tribunal, it is to be assumed that he
    knew and applied the law correctly unless the contrary is  established.
    Mr Babarinde has not established any such error.

26.  Having  reached  the  conclusions  he  did   about   the   appellant's
    relationship with Mr [O] and the best interests of the children,  Judge
    Widdup undertook a detailed balancing exercise, taking  proper  account
    of the matters which militated against the appellant in the  Article  8
    'balance sheet'.  He was entitled to conclude, for the reasons he gave,
    that the public interest outweighed those matters  on  the  appellant's
    side of the balance sheet.  Whilst [JnO]  would  benefit  from  ongoing
    support in the UK, the need to maintain  immigration  control  and  the
    appellant's precarious or unlawful status throughout militated  against
    her and her children remaining in the UK.  In reaching that conclusion,
    the judge  demonstrably  considered  and  applied  relevant  authority,
    including EV (Philippines), and there is no basis for a submission that
    he misdirected himself on the law.  It was for the judge to balance the
    competing considerations and to reach a decision under Article 8  ECHR.
    The conclusion that he reached in that respect was adequately  reasoned
    and fully in accordance with the  relevant  authorities.   Neither  the
    grounds of appeal nor the submissions made by  Mr  Babarinde  establish
    any legal error on Judge Widdup's part.
