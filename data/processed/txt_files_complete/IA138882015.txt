                                                                    Claimant

For the appellant:     Ms CF Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Smith promulgated 21.9.15, allowing the  claimant's
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State,  dated  25.3.15,
    to refuse her application made on 10.2.15 to vary leave to  remain  and
    to remove her from the UK pursuant to section 47 Immigration Asylum and
    Nationality Act 2006 .  The Judge heard the appeal on 16.9.15.

 2. Designated First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Manuell  granted  permission  to
    appeal on 2.2.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 30.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below I find such error of law in the making of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require the  decision  of
    Judge Smith to be set aside and for the decision in the  appeal  to  be
    remade in the First-tier Tribunal,  in  accordance  with  the  attached
    directions.

 5. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    claimant, who is 68 years of age, has in the past regularly visited the
    6 of her children who are resident in the UK. On each occasion she  did
    so with a visit visa. She last entered the UK on 30.9.14, but failed to
    leave and became an overstayer, claiming that her  ill-health  prevents
    her from returning to Pakistan where there would be no  care  available
    for her. She  has  a  husband  and  three  further  children  still  in
    Pakistan. However, it is said that the husband is too frail to care for
    his wife and the children have their own commitments.

 6. Judge Smith did not allow the appeal outright but, finding that she had
    not followed her own policy in respect of compassionate  circumstances,
    purported to quash the decision of the Secretary of State  and  'remit'
    it to her to make a further decision. It follows that Judge  Smith  did
    not address the substantive issues in the appeal.

 7. In granting permission to appeal Judge Manuell found it "arguable  that
    the judge erred in her interpretation of the reasons for refusal letter
    because those issues had been considered under the heading 'Exceptional
    Circumstances" which amounts to the same thing. AS (Afghanistan) v SSHD
    [2009] EWCA Civ 1076 may be relevant. Permission to appeal  is  granted
    accordingly."

 8. The First-tier Tribunal has no power of remittal to  and  no  power  to
    quash a decision of the Secretary of State. However, the  intention  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge is plain: to  allow  the  appeal  on  the
    limited basis that the decision of the Secretary of State  was  not  in
    accordance with the law, so that it remains for the Secretary of  State
    to make a decision on the claimant's application which is in accordance
    with the law.

 9. The claimant's  undated  Rule  24  reply,  supplemented  by  Mr  Vokes'
    skeleton  argument  dated  15.2.16,  asserts  that  the   grounds   are
    misconceived in law. It is submitted that in addition to making a claim
    on the basis of private and family  life  under  article  8  ECHR,  the
    claimant   submitted   that   there   were   sufficiently    compelling
    compassionate circumstances to warrant a grant of  discretionary  leave
    outside the Rules. Reference  is  made  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
    policy, recited at ï¿½11 of the decision of Judge Smith, suggesting  that
    compelling compassionate factors are exceptional circumstances  outside
    of Article 8.

10. However, it  is  clear  from  the  refusal  decision  that  exceptional
    circumstances were considered, stating "It  has  also  been  considered
    whether the  particular  circumstances  set  out  in  your  application
    constitute exceptional circumstances." The refusal decision goes on  to
    consider the very matters relied on in the application to the Secretary
    of State, including, in some detail, the  claimant's  health  and  what
    care provisions there might be for her in Pakistan. The matters  relied
    on by the claimant were set out in  the  letter  from  her  solicitors,
    dated 10.2.15, including that she is totally dependant for her care and
    well-being on her two sons and daughters in the UK and  does  not  have
    anyone capable of looking after her in Pakistan,  and  that  given  her
    medical condition and care needs she cannot return to Pakistan.

11. The Secretary of  State  considered  that  there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances in her case.

12. It is relevant to this consideration that the Immigration  Rules  under
    sections E-ECDR and E-ILRDR of Appendix FM provide for  the  settlement
    of an adult dependent relative. This  claimant  could  not  meet  those
    requirements, not least because they apply only to entry clearance  and
    those in the UK with  existing  valid  leave  to  remain  as  an  adult
    dependent relative, and not to other applications for leave to  remain.
    However, the high threshold set out in those provisions, together  with
    the  specified  evidence  required  under  Appendix  FM-SE  are  highly
    relevant to the assessment of what might be  considered  as  compelling
    compassionate circumstances  outside  the  Rules.  The  Rules  are,  of
    course, the Secretary of State's balanced response between private  and
    family life claims and the  public  interest  in  immigration  control.
    Those provisions require the  application  to  demonstrate  that  as  a
    result of age, illness or disability they  require  long-term  personal
    care to perform everyday tasks and that they are unable, even with  the
    practical and financial help of the sponsor,  to  obtain  the  required
    level of care in their home country because either it is not  available
    and there is no person in that country who can reasonably  provide  it,
    or it is not affordable. The specified  evidence  required  to  justify
    such a claim is also quite comprehensive.

13. I see no practical difference between  the  policy  relied  on  by  the
    claimant and the way in which the claimed compassionate or  exceptional
    compelling circumstances  were  considered  in  the  refusal  decision.
    Whether the considerations are within or  without  family  and  private
    life rights makes no material difference as  they  were  in  any  event
    considered in full.  In  the  circumstances,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    should have gone on to consider the appeal substantively. In failing to
    do so the Tribunal erred in law  so  that  the  decision  allowing  the
    appeal cannot stand.

14. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. There has been no determination  of
    the substantive issues in this appeal.

15. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the parties of a fair hearing and  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision in the appeal to  the
                    First-tier Tribunal  in  accordance  with  the  attached
                    directions.

Consequential Directions

17. The  decision  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  sitting  at
    Nottingham, or such other Tribunal venue as the Tribunal administration
    deem appropriate;

18. The appeal is to be reheard afresh in its entirety;

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
