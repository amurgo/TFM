                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a female citizen of  Pakistan  born  on  5th  December
    1972.  She applied on 2nd August 2012 for entry clearance in  order  to
    visit the UK for a period of one week to visit her  sister-in-law,  the
    Sponsor Lubna Khokar, and her newly-born child.  That  application  was
    refused on 21st August 2012 for  the  reasons  given  in  a  Notice  of
    Decision of that date.  The Appellant  appealed,  and  her  appeal  was
    heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Raymond (the  Judge)  sitting
    at Hatton Cross on 13th March 2013.  He decided to dismiss  the  appeal
    for the reasons given in his Determination of  27th  March  2013.   The
    Appellant sought leave to appeal that decision, and  on  2nd  May  2013
    such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the application because he was  not
    satisfied that the Appellant was a genuine visitor for  the  period  as
    stated by her who would leave the UK at the end of her proposed  visit;
    and that during  the  visit  the  Appellant  would  be  maintained  and
    accommodated adequately and could meet the cost of her return or onward
    journey.  This was because there was little reliable evidence as to the
    Appellant's  financial  circumstances  in   Pakistan.    In   a   brief
    Determination, the Judge dismissed the appeal because he found that the
    concerns of the Entry Clearance Officer had not been addressed  by  the
    evidence to the Tribunal.

 4. At the hearing I heard submissions  on  behalf  of  both  parties.   Ms
    Bexson argued that the Judge had erred in law in making  his  decision.
    There was ample evidence contained in the Appellant's bundle as to  the
    financial circumstances of the Sponsor in the UK and hence her  ability
    to accommodate and maintain the Appellant.  The Judge had not explained
    why he had not attached any weight to this evidence.   The  Appellant's
    bundle  also  contained  evidence  as  to  the  Appellant's   financial
    circumstances in Pakistan.  The Judge had not dealt with this  evidence
    in his Determination.

 5. In response, Mr Avery argued that  the  Judge  had  not  erred  in  law
    because he had made findings open to him on the  evidence  before  him.
    The key issue in the case was the Appellant's intention  to  return  to
    Pakistan, but as her financial circumstances there were uncertain,  the
    Judge was entitled to conclude that he was not satisfied  as  to  those
    intentions.

 6. I found an error of law in the decision of the Judge so that it  should
    be set aside.  The Judge did not engage with the  evidence  before  him
    contained  in  the  Appellant's  bundle  dealing  with  the   Sponsor's
    financial  circumstances  in  the  UK  and  the  Appellant's  financial
    circumstances in Pakistan.  The Judge gave insufficient reasons for his
    decision.

Remade Decision

 7. I proceeded to remake the decision of the Judge.  Mr Avery declined the
    opportunity  to  address  me  again.   Ms  Bexson  submitted  that  the
    intentions of the Appellant were genuine.  There  was  nothing  in  the
    immigration history of this family to cause doubt.  The  Appellant  had
    numerous ties with Pakistan.  The  Appellant  had  a  good  reason  for
    wishing to visit the UK for a short period.

 8. The Appellant proposed to visit the UK for a period of no more than one
    week in order to see her brother and his wife.  This would be the first
    opportunity of any  member  of  the  family  in  Pakistan  to  see  the
    Sponsor's son Muhammad Ahmad  born  on  16th  February  2009.   It  was
    proposed that the Sponsor would maintain and accommodate the  Appellant
    throughout the short duration of the visit.  There is evidence at pages
    29 to 35 of the Appellant's bundle that the Sponsor  is  in  employment
    earning usually just in excess of ï¿½1,300 per month net.   There  is  no
    evidence before me of her husband's income, nor of the family's  living
    expenses, but on the basis of this evidence I found  it  probable  that
    the Sponsor would be able to maintain  and  accommodate  the  Appellant
    during the one week duration of this proposed visit.

 9. The Appellant was to pay the cost of her travel.  On the basis  of  her
    evidence that her visit was to be funded by her father and her  husband
    in addition to her own resources, I find that she is  able  to  do  so.
    There is documentary evidence in the  Appellant's  bundle  of  adequate
    liquid assets regardless of their source.

10. I also accept the Appellant's evidence that her intention  is  only  to
    enjoy a brief visit to the UK and then to return to her own country.  I
    find no reason to doubt the credibility of this evidence.  There  is  a
    plausible and  sensible  reason  for  the  visit.   The  Appellant  has
    significant ties to Pakistan in the form of her husband, her  son,  her
    parents, and her siblings all of whom will remain in that country.  The
    Appellant does not have an adverse immigration history.   The  Sponsor,
    whom I also find to be credible, has said in  her  statement  that  the
    Appellant belongs to a "well off" family in  Pakistan,  and  I  do  not
    think that there has been any attempt to deceive  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer as to the circumstances of the  Appellant's  family  indicating
    that it is not the Appellant's intention  to  return  to  Pakistan.   I
    therefore find that the requirements of paragraph 41 of HC 395 are  met
    and this appeal is allowed.

Decision

11. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

12. I set aside the decision.

13. I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

Anonymity

14. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005  and  I
    find no need for me to do so.

Upper Tribunal Judge Renton
TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In the light of my  decision  to  remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee award.  However, as  no
fee is paid or payable there can be no such fee award.
