               THE SECRETARy OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs Larissa Zanzala, in person
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Congo.  She appeals the respondent's
      decision of 16th November 2016 to refuse to issue an EEA Residence
      Card as the family member of an EEA national exercising treaty rights
      in the UK in accordance with Regulation 7 of the Immigration (European
      Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations").


   2. On 21st December 2013, the appellant was married to Mr Serge Aran
      Zanzala, an Austrian national, who claimed to be exercising free
      movement rights in accordance with the 2006 Regulations. However,
      evidence provided in support of the application establishes that Mr
      Serge Zanzala was married to Pascale Edith Mamnouo-Derikissa on 22nd
      June 1992 and they did not divorce until 8th April 2015.  The
      respondent concluded that in the circumstances, Mr Zanzala was not
      free to marry the appellant on 21st December 2013 and therefore the
      appellant is not a 'family member' as defined in Regulation 7 of the
      2006 Regulations.  Furthermore the respondent did not accept that the
      appellant had provided sufficient evidence to establish that she is
      the partner of, and in a durable relationship with an EEA national
      such as to qualify as an 'extended family member' as defined in
      Regulation 8 of the 2006 Regulations.  Finally, the respondent was not
      satisfied that the EEA sponsor is currently exercising his treaty
      rights in the United Kingdom.


   3. The appellant's appeal against that decision was dismissed by First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Ripley for reasons set out in a decision
      promulgated on 8th March 2017.  Judge Ripley found that EEA sponsor
      ("Mr Zanzala") is a 'qualified person' within the meaning set out in
      Regulation 6(1) of the 2006 Regulations.  She was satisfied the
      appellant has produced sufficient evidence to establish that Mr
      Zanzala is employed as a Warehouse Assistant by DFS.  Judge Ripley
      considered the explanation provided by the appellant that at the time
      of their marriage, Mr Zanzala understood his divorce nisi to be the
      final divorce document and had not understood, until two years later,
      that the divorce had not been finalised until the grant of a decree
      absolute. Judge Ripley found that the appellant has not established
      that her marriage would be recognised in Austrian or indeed UK law,
      and she was not therefore satisfied that the appellant is a spouse or
      civil partner of the EEA sponsor within the meaning of Regulation 7.
      Judge Ripley did not go on to consider whether the appellant is an
      'Extended family member' as defined in Regulation 8 because she
      considered she did not have jurisdiction to do so.


   4. The appellant was granted permission to appeal the decision of Judge
      Ripley by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on 14th January 2019.  I set
      aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ripley for reasons set
      out in my 'error of law' decision dated 27th January 2020.  Given the
      limited issue that remained between the parties, I directed that the
      decision would be remade in the Upper Tribunal. I directed that the
      appellant shall file and serve any further evidence that she seeks to
      rely upon, within 14 days of my decision being sent to the appellant.


   5. The matter was listed for a resumed hearing on 30th March 2020, but
      that hearing was vacated because of the need to take precautions
      against the spread of Covid-19.  The matter was relisted for hearing
      before me on 22nd December 2020.  The appellant appeared before me
      unrepresented and was accompanied by her partner.  The appellant and
      her partner were assisted throughout the hearing before me by an
      interpreter arranged by the Tribunal.  I was satisfied that the
      appellant, her partner and the interpreter were able to communicate
      with each other and that the appellant and her partner were able to
      fully participate in the hearing without any difficulty.


   6. At the outset of the hearing before me, I was informed by the
      appellant that in response to the direction previously made by me in
      January 2020, the appellant's partner had sent a letter dated 31st
      January 2020 to the Tribunal and to the respondent setting out the
      matters relied upon, and to which various documents were attached. A
      copy could not be found on the Tribunal file, but during the course of
      the hearing, Mr Bates was able to find the copy received by the
      respondent.  I was provided with a copy.


The issues


   7. At the outset of the hearing before me, with the assistance of Mr
      Bates, I identified and explained to the appellant the issues that I
      am required to consider.  Judge Ripley had previously found, in March
      2017, that Mr Zanzala is a 'qualified person' within the meaning set
      out in Regulation 6(1) of the 2006 Regulations.  Mr Bates submitted
      that given the passage of time and the declaratory nature of the
      decision, it is for the appellant to establish and satisfy the
      Tribunal that Mr Zanzala remains a 'qualified person' within the
      meaning set out in Regulation 6(1) of the 2006 Regulations.


   8. Judge Ripley found that the appellant is not a spouse or civil partner
      of the EEA sponsor within the meaning of Regulation 7 and cannot
      therefore qualify as a 'family member' under the 2006 Regulations.
      There is nothing to undermine that finding and the appellant confirmed
      before me that she has not since entered into a valid marriage that is
      recognised in law.  The remaining issue is whether the appellant is
      the partner of, and in a durable relationship with Mr Zanzala so that
      she in an 'extended family member' within the meaning set out in
      Regulation 8.


The evidence


   9. I heard oral evidence from the appellant and her partner, Mr Serge
      Zanzala. A full account of the evidence and the submissions made
      before me is set out in the record of proceedings.  In reaching my
      decision I have fully considered all the evidence that was before the
      Tribunal, whether it is expressly referred to in this decision or not.


  10. In the absence of a witness statement from the appellant, I invited
      the appellant to set out in her oral evidence the evidence she relies
      upon to support the claim that she is the partner of, and in a durable
      relationship with Mr Serge Zanzala.  She maintained they are in a
      durable relationship.  She said there are three children of the
      relationship.  She said that she met Mr Zanzala in in or about August
      2008 in Congo. Mr Zanzala was living in the UK at the time and she was
      living in Congo.  His father passed away in Congo and they met when Mr
      Zanzala returned to Congo to deal with the burial of his father.  Mr
      Zanzala had remained in Congo for about a month before he returned to
      the UK.  They then kept in touch by telephone.  Although Mr Zanzala
      was married, she was aware that his marriage was in difficulty.  In
      2009 Mr Zanzala returned to Congo and by that time, she understood
      that his ex-partner had filed for divorce.  They became closer and
      eventually became engaged at a ceremony attended by their families.
      Their first daughter, who I shall refer to as JVZ, was born on 22nd
      March 2010.  A photograph of the 'blessing' of their first daughter
      was included with the documents sent to the respondent and Tribunal
      under cover of the letter dated 31st January 2020.


  11. The appellant explained that Mr Zanzala remained in Congo and they
      continued to live together at the same address in Congo with their
      daughter.  On 21st June 2013, their second daughter, who I shall refer
      to as NCZ, was born.  The appellant said that after the birth of their
      second daughter, Mr Zanzala was told by his ex-partner that they were
      now divorced, and both the appellant and Mr Zanzala believed they were
      free to marry. They decided to marry in Congo, and they were married
      on 21st December 2013 in Brazzaville.  They had been living together
      for about 3 years prior to the marriage and after the marriage, they
      continued to live together in Brazzaville.


  12. The appellant said that in January 2014, Mr Zanzala decided to return
      to Europe.  because he was a European national.  He settled in the UK
      and then made an application for family reunion so that the appellant
      and their two daughters could join him.  They arrived in the UK in
      January 2016, with the benefit of a 6-month family reunion visa.  They
      lived together at an address in Eskdale Drive, Beeston, Nottingham and
      the appellant became pregnant.  Their third daughter, who I shall
      refer to as BDZ, was born on 17th October 2016.  They continued to
      live at the same address until about March 2017, when they had to move
      into emergency accommodation that was arranged by the local authority.
       In about July 2017 they moved into other Council accommodation in
      Beeston, Nottingham and they have continued to live together at the
      same address since.  The appellant has provided a copy of a letter
      dated 4th July 2018 from HMRC addressed to the appellant and her
      partner at that address, regarding tax credit awards for the period
      6th April 2018 to 5th April 2019.  She has also provided a letter
      addressed to her at her current address from Severn Trent Water.


  13. The appellant said that Mr Zanzala had previously worked for DFS and
      he left that employment about a year ago.  He has been working for
      'The Very Group' in a warehouse for about a year and is paid about
      �1300 per month.


  14. In cross-examination, the appellant confirmed that her three daughters
      all attend Beeston Field Primary School.  Mr Zanzala sometimes takes
      the children to school.  When asked about the family home, the
      appellant said that the house that they live in has three bedrooms,
      one living room, a kitchen, a bathroom on the ground floor, and a
      toilet upstairs.  The property has two toilets altogether, one in the
      downstairs bathroom and a separate toilet upstairs.  The appellant was
      asked about the sleeping arrangements and confirmed that she and Mr
      Zanzala have a bedroom.  Mr Zanzala's son from a previous relationship
      occupies one of the bedrooms and their three daughters occupy the
      remaining room which has a bunkbed.  Two of the girls sleep on the
      bottom bunk which is like a double bed and one sleeps on the bunk
      above.


  15. Mr Zanzala was called to give evidence.  He said that the appellant is
      his wife, and they have three children together.  Two of their
      daughters were born whist they lived together in Congo and their third
      daughter was born in the UK.  He said that they have in the past, and
      now continue to live together in the same house.  He said that they
      met in Congo in 2006 when his father passed away and he had returned
      to attend the burial. The appellant had attended the burial. They had
      lived in the same village and their families had previously known each
      other.


  16. Mr Zanzala said that he had remained in Congo for about a month after
      the burial of his father.  When he returned to the UK, he said that he
      did not have any contact with the appellant.  His evidence was that he
      had established contact with the appellant again when he returned to
      Congo following difficulties in his relationship with his wife in the
      UK.  He returned to Congo in about March 2009 and at first lived in a
      hostel.  When he started to run out of money to pay for the hostel, he
      started to look for someone who could assist him and the appellant had
      offered to assist and allowed  him to stay where she was living.  He
      said that initially the appellant had offered him a bed and she slept
      on the sofa. However, he began to open up to her and told her about
      the difficulties he had experienced with his wife in the UK.  That
      drew them closer and their relationship then developed. They have
      continued living together since.  In 2014, he decided to return to the
      UK because he has children living in the UK from a previous
      relationship.  When he arrived in the UK in 2014, he lived with his
      son for a few months  Mr Zanzala said that he lived at the address in
      Esdala Drive, Nottingham for about three years until about March 2017.
       He was joined by the appellant and their daughters in 2016.  He said
      that in March 2017 they had moved into emergency accommodation in
      Nottingham, that was arranged by the council and they had lived in
      that accommodation for about three months.  They then moved into
      accommodation provided by the local authority in or about June 2017,
      and they have been living together as a family at their current
      address since that time.


  17. Mr Zanzala said that he had started working for DFS in October 2014.
      He worked there until July/August 2019 and left that employment
      because he was advised by his GP that the work was too physical and
      kidney stones had developed in his kidneys.  He said that he then
      worked as a delivery driver for a newspaper for about three months
      earning approximately �300 per week.  He said that he finished working
      as a delivery driver in March 2020 and since then, he has been working
      for the 'Very Group', as a packer/warehouse assistant.  He said that
      he earns about �1300 each month.  He confirmed that he has  a contract
      of employment, but he was not aware that he had to produce that or
      other evidence of his income or employment.


  18. In cross-examination, Mr Zanzala was also asked about the property at
      which the family live.  He said that the property has three bedrooms.
      He and his partner have a bedroom in which the youngest of their
      daughters also sometimes sleeps.  The girls share a bedroom, and the
      third bedroom is occupied by his son.  He said that the property has
      two toilets, one downstairs in the bathroom, and a separate toilet
      upstairs.  Mr Zanzala confirmed that his three daughters all attend
      Beeston Field Nursery and Primary School.


  19. Mr Bates asked Mr Zanzala about his employment.  He confirmed that the
      warehouse at which he works is on the border of Derby, Nottingham and
      Leicester and that he works twelve-hour shifts working four days and
      then having four days off.


Submissions


  20. I heard submissions from Mr Bates.  He quite properly acknowledged
      that the evidence of the appellant and Mr Zanzala regarding their
      relationship is broadly consistent and on balance, there appears to be
      a genuine and durable relationship.  Mr Bates submitted that although
      the appellant has failed to produce any evidence to support the claim
      that Mr Zanzala remains in employment, it is right to acknowledge that
      both the appellant and Mr Zanzala again gave consistent evidence
      regarding his current employment and income.


  21. The appellant had nothing to add.


Findings and conclusions


  22. It is for the appellant to establish, on a balance of probabilities,
      her entitlement to an EEA Residence Card in accordance with The
      Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations.  The 2006
      Regulations now been replaced by the 2016 Regulations but insofar as
      this appeal is concerned, the relevant regulations are, for all
      intents and purposes, the same.


  23. In reaching my decision I have considered all the evidence and
      material before the Tribunal and the submissions made by Mr Bates.  I
      have had the opportunity of hearing the appellant and her partner give
      evidence, and seeing their evidence tested in cross-examination.
      Matters of credibility are never easy to determine, particularly, as
      here, where the evidence is received through an interpreter.  I
      acknowledge that there may be a danger of misinterpretation, and I
      have also borne in mind the fact that events that may have occurred
      some time ago, can impact on an individual's ability to recall exact
      circumstances.  I have considered the appellant's evidence and the
      story as a whole, against the available material and other familiar
      factors, such as consistency with what the appellant has said before,
      the evidence of her partner, and the documents relied upon, albeit
      limited.


  24. I found the appellant and her partner to be credible witnesses.  They
      were unrepresented and plainly failed to appreciate the need to
      provide evidence to support the claims being made, particularly
      insofar as the employment of Mr Zanzala is concerned.  It was apparent
      to me that neither the appellant nor Mr Zanzala had appreciated that
      they may face questions regarding their current living arrangements
      and the employment and income of Mr Zanzala.  Nevertheless, they
      answered questions put to them in cross-examination without any
      hesitation and their evidence was broadly consistent in material
      respects. There were two inconsistencies in the evidence.  The first
      was in relation to the year that they first met and the second was in
      relation to the current sleeping arrangements in the family home.


  25. In her evidence, the appellant claimed that they first met in August
      2008 when Mr Zanzala travelled to Congo.  Mr Zanzala said in his
      evidence that is father passed away in 2006 and they first met in
      2006.  However, they were both consistent in their claim that they
      first met when Mr Zanzala had returned to Congo to attend the burial
      of his father, and that he had remained in Congo for about a month
      following the burial, before he returned to the UK.  In my judgement
      the inconsistency between the evidence as to the year in which Mr
      Zanzala's father passed away is likely to be explained by the passage
      of time since that event.  Insofar as it is necessary, I prefer the
      evidence of Mr Zanzala and find that his father passed away in 2006.
      I find the appellant and Mr Zanzala were previously known to each
      other because they lived in the same village and their families were
      acquainted. I find that they met briefly in 2006, but it was not until
      Mr Zanzala returned to Congo in 2009 that their relationship began.


  26. The only other inconsistency in the evidence was regarding the current
      sleeping arrangements in the family home.  The evidence of the
      appellant was that their three daughters share a bedroom. The evidence
      of Mr Zanzala was that the youngest child usually sleeps in her
      parent's bedroom. That is in my judgement a minor inconsistency that
      does not, as Mr Bates properly acknowledged, undermine the claim that
      the appellant and Mr Zanzala are in a genuine and durable
      relationship.  When the evidence is considered as a whole, and in
      particular, when one has regard to the other evidence received by the
      Tribunal regarding the addresses at which the family have lived at
      various times, and the general living arrangements, I am satisfied
      that the appellant and Mr Zanzala gave evidence that was entirely
      consistent in materials respects and have given a truthful account of
      their relationship.


  27. I first consider whether Mr Zanzala is a 'qualified person'.  It is
      uncontroversial that he is an Austrian national in the United Kingdom.
      Judge Ripley had previously found, in March 2017, that Mr Zanzala is a
      'qualified person' within the meaning set out in Regulation 6(1) of
      the 2006 Regulations. She accepted the evidence before the Tribunal of
      his employment with DFS.  I accept the oral evidence of Mr Zanzala
      that he worked for DFS until July/August 2019 and left that employment
      because he was advised it was having an impact upon his health.  I
      accept his oral evidence that he then worked as a delivery driver for
      a newspaper and that since March 2020 he has been working for the
      'Very Group', as a packer/warehouse assistant earning approximately
      �1300 per month.  Although there was no documentary evidence to
      corroborate his claim to be employed, I am satisfied that he had
      simply failed to appreciate the need to provide evidence in support.
      I accept the oral evidence because both the appellant and Mr Zanzala
      were asked separately in cross-examination about Mr Zanzala's
      employment and earnings and their evidence was entirely consistent.


  28. Finally, I must consider whether the appellant is an 'extended family
      member' as defined in Regulation 8.  Neither Council Directive
      2004/38/EC nor the 2006 or 2016 Regulations provide a definition of
      'durable relationship'.  Insofar as is relevant, the respondent's
      guidance; Free Movement Rights: extended family members of EEA
      nationals, Version 7.0 published on 27th March 2019 states:


         Evidence required for durable partners


         A durable relationship is an unmarried partnership which has
         normally continued for 2 years or more. The evidence the applicant
         can provide may include:


             .proof that any previous relationship has permanently broken
             down, for example a: decree absolute for marriages


             ...


             .evidence of cohabitation for 2years, for example:


                 o bank statements or utility bills in joint names at the
                   same address


                 o rent agreements


                 o mortgage payments


                 o official correspondence which links them at the same
                   address


             .evidence of joint finances, joint business ventures and joint
             commitments, for example:


                 o tax returns


                 o business contracts


                 o investments


             .evidence of joint responsibility for children such as:


                 o a birth certificate or custody agreement showing they are
                   cohabiting and sharing responsibility for children


             .photographs of the couple


             .other evidence demonstrating their commitment and
         relationship


         You must always consider the individual circumstances of the
         application. For example, there may be instances when the couple
         have not been in a relationship for 2 years or more, but you are
         still satisfied that the relationship is subsisting and durable.
         This may be, for example, where the couple have a child together
         and a birth certificate showing shared parentage has been provided
         with evidence of living together.


  29. I accept the evidence given by the appellant and Mr Zanzala regarding
      their relationship.  The appellant and Mr Zanzala lived together for a
      number of years in Congo and I find, they have lived together since
      the appellant's arrival in the UK in 2016.  There are three children
      of the relationship.  A copy of the birth certificates for each of the
      children has been provided to the respondent and the Tribunal.  The
      appellant has also demonstrated her commitment to the relationship by
      the assistance and care she provides to Mr Zanzala's son from a
      previous relationship, who continues to live in the family home.
      Having carefully considered the evidence before me, I find the
      appellant is the partner (other than a civil partner) of, and in a
      durable relationship with, an EEA national and it follows that she is,
      in my judgment, an 'extended family member' as defined in Regulation
      8.


  30. In my judgement the appellant has established an entitlement to a
      Residence Card, and I allow the appeal.


Decision:

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

Although I have allowed the appeal, I have done so having had the
opportunity of considering the evidence provided by the appellant and with
the benefit of hearing the oral evidence of the appellant and her partner,
much of which was not before the respondent at the time of the respondent's
decision.  In all the circumstances, I decline to make a fee award.
