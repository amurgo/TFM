      DETERMINATION AND DIRECTIONS FOR REMITTAL TO FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL



This is an appeal by the appellant against a determination dated 7  November
2013 of First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes and Mr  H  G  Jones  MBE  JP  which
refused her appeal against an automatic deportation order made  on  13  June
2013.

I make an anonymity order under Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008, precluding publication of  any  information  regarding
the proceedings which would be likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
identify the appellant, her partner or their children.  I do so in order  to
avoid the likelihood of serious harm to  the  children  arising  from  their
identification.

The background to this matter is that the appellant came to the UK in  April
2000 with her daughter, P. They initially had leave  as  visitors  and  then
overstayed. The appellant claimed asylum  in  2006.  The  asylum  claim  was
refused and failed on appeal in March 2007 but the Article 8  claim  of  the
appellant and her daughter was allowed and discretionary leave granted.

The appellant formed a relationship with DK, a national  of  the  Democratic
Republic of Congo who had no leave. The couple had  a  son,  S,  born  on  2
February 2008. During her pregnancy with S, the appellant was  diagnosed  as
HIV positive and S is also HIV positive.

On 2 November 2010 the appellant,  her  daughter,  DK  and  S  were  granted
indefinite leave to remain.

On 29 March 2011, the appellant and DK had another son, M. He is  a  British
national.

In 2004 the appellant made a fraudulent application for a  British  passport
using a false birth certificate.  The  appellant  admits  doing  so  but  no
charges were brought.

In 2005 the appellant was cautioned for shoplifting.

On 26 June 2012, the appellant was sentenced to 20 months' imprisonment  for
conspiracy to defraud, dishonestly  making  false  representations  to  make
gain for self and knowingly being concerned in a  fraudulent  activity.  The
sentence was subsequently reduced to 16 months  imprisonment.  The  offences
were, in essence, benefit fraud of over ï¿½60,000  which  she  conducted  with
her sister who was  also  convicted  and  sentenced  to  imprisonment.   The
deportation order of 13 June 2013 followed.

The challenge to the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  was that it:

     1. failed to treat the best interest of  the  children  as  a  primary
        consideration

     2. was procedurally unfair  as  written  submissions  made  after  the
        hearing were not put before the judge

     3. contained a misdirection on the correct  burden  of  proof  in  the
        Article 8 proportionality assessment

     4. was factually wrong on  whether  the  assessment  of  the  risk  of
        reoffending in the probation service letter dated 23 September 2013
        included the appellant's fraudulent passport application


I found that the first ground had merit. At [21] to [26] and  [31]  to  [34]
the First-tier Tribunal set out the circumstances of the children.  At  [31]
the panel  states  that  it  has  considered  "the  best  interests  of  the
children". At [26] and [32] to [34] the panel set  out  how  the  children's
best interests had not been well served  in  the  past  and  identified  how
their care might be managed in future if the appellant was deported.

At no point, however, does the panel identify what  the  best  interests  of
the children were, notwithstanding  the  statement  in  [31].  There  is  no
indication at any point in the determination that the  panel  was  aware  of
their duty weigh the best interests of the children  as  a  primary  factor.
The skeleton argument that was before the panel requested  consideration  of
the children's best  interests  as  a  primary  consideration.  It  set  out
relevant factors such as the length of residence of P and that she would  be
without a parent were the appellant deported and the role of  the  appellant
as the primary carer of all three children.  At [33]  and  [34],  the  panel
sets out actions of the adults that have had a negative impact on  the  best
interests of the appellant and in doing entangles the best interests of  the
children with the conduct of the appellant and the father of the  two  boys,
offending the principle set out at [33] and [42] of  ZH  (Tanzania)  v  SSHD
[2011] UKSC 4. The absence of any reference to the duty under  s.55  of  the
British Citizenship, Immigration and Asylum Act 2009 or to case law  setting
out the correct approach to that provision such  as  ZH  (Tanzania)  v  SSHD
makes it difficult to read into the paragraphs concerning the children  that
the panel had the correct approach to their best interests in mind.

I concluded that, albeit the best interests of the children  in  any  appeal
are not a "trump card", they must be indentified and weighed  as  a  primary
factor and that did not happen here. I found that sufficient  to  amount  to
an error on a point of law such that the Article 8 decision  should  be  set
aside and re-made.

I also found that the second ground had merit, albeit no  criticism  of  the
First-tier Tribunal panel attaches thereto. It  is  not  disputed  that  the
appellant's legal representatives  sent  in  written  submissions  dated  25
October 2013 following the hearing  on  22  October  2013.  The  submissions
addressed the respondent's failure to  apply  or  address  at  all  her  own
policies on deportation cases concerning families with  children,  including
obtaining advice from Social Services  and  the  Office  of  the  Children's
Champion.

The grounds of appeal state that the submissions were  sent  on  28  October
2013. The date stamp for receipt on the written submission is not clear  and
could be 25 October 2013 or 29 October 2013.  The  latter  would  seem  more
likely given the assertion in the grounds that the submissions were sent  on
28 October 2013. In any event, it is common ground  that  the  determination
was not promulgated until 7 November  2013.  The  written  submissions  were
with the Tribunal prior to promulgation, therefore.

There is nothing, however, to indicate that the submissions were brought  to
the attention of the panel prior to promulgation.  The  determination  makes
no reference to them. Rather, as identified at paragraph 12 of  the  grounds
of appeal, the panel identified aspects  of  the  evidence  concerning  that
appeared to be lacking, those aspects being capable of being  addressed  had
the respondent applied her policies.  The reported case of  MM  (unfairness;
E & R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 105 (IAC) provides that a failure to show  why  the
material could not have been provided for the hearing and a failure  on  the
part of legal advisers are not principles to be applied "with  full  vigour"
in appeals such as this. That case also cautions against  straying  into  an
evaluation of  the  substantial  merits  of  the  material  in  the  written
submissions and  the  appeal  when  deciding  whether  the  decision  making
process was adequate.

 In the light of these matters I accepted that procedural  unfairness  arose
where the written submissions were not put to the First-tier Tribunal  panel
for them to decide on how to deal with them and  that  this  amounted  to  a
material error on a point of law such that the determination had to  be  set
aside to be re-made. The parties were also in  agreement  that  if  such  an
error was found it would mean that the appellant  had  been  deprived  of  a
fair hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  and  that  the  appeal  should
remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to  be  re-decided  following  paragraph
7.2 of Part  3  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement  dated  25
September 2012.

I did not find that the other two grounds had any merit. It is not  entirely
clear what aspect of the decision is being referred to  at  [10]  where  the
panel states that the burden of proof was on the appellant  to  the  balance
of probabilities.  Part  of  the  decision  relates  to  the  provisions  of
paragraphs 398 and 399 of the Immigration Rules and the  stated  burden  and
standard of proof is correct in that regard although it would not be had  it
referred specifically to the proportionality  assessment  where  the  burden
passes  to  the  respondent.  I  was  not  taken  to   any   part   of   the
proportionality assessment which suggested that,  in  substance,  the  wrong
approach was taken, however.

I also did not find that the panel was in error  at  [18]  in  querying  the
risk of reoffending where it did  not  include  the  appellant's  fraudulent
application for a false passport. The  probation  service  letter  dated  23
September 2013 states in  terms  on  the  first  page  that  the  fraudulent
passport application "it is not included in the  statistical  analysis  made
which calculates re-offending rates."  It  is  my  view  that  it  was  this
statement that the panel had in mind when it commented as  it  did  at  [18]
and [22] on its concern about the fraudulent  passport  application.  I  did
not find that the First-tier Tribunal was in error in doing so.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal under Article 8 discloses  an  error
on a point of law such that it should be set aside and  re-made.  That  part
of the appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-made de novo.

DIRECTIONS

The appeal will be heard at the Birmingham hearing centre on Thursday 1  May
2014 before a panel other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes and Mr  H  G
Jones MBE JP.

By 17 April 2014, the parties are to file with the First-tier  Tribunal  and
serve on the other party any further material that is to be relied upon.
