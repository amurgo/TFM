Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr E Nicholson, Counsel, instructed by Mulberry
Finch

   i. In the context of a Post Study Work  appeal  based  on  the  right  to
      respect for private life, the balancing of  all  relevant  factors  of
      significance cannot be confined to consideration  of  the  appellant's
      ability  to  self-maintain  and   the   potential   to   misunderstand
      requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  corresponding   Policy
      Guidance.

  ii. Sullivan J's observations in R (on the  application  of  Forrester)  v
      SSHD [2008] EWHC 2307 (Admin) were not meant to  enunciate  a  general
      proposition about Immigration Rules that are in non-discretionary form
      or to imply a view that any policy fitting this description could have
      no public interest weighting.

 iii. The decision in OA (Nigeria) [2008] EWCA Civ 82 was fact-sensitive and
      in any event affords little assistance when considering the case of  a
      person who has applied, not to complete  studies,  but  to  switch  to
      employment, in circumstances where she could only expect to be able to
      do so if she met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The respondent (hereafter "claimant") is a  citizen  of  Kenya.  In  a
    determination notified on 13  May  2008  Immigration  Judge  (IJ)  Gibb
    allowed her appeal against a decision made by the Secretary of State on
    27 February 2009 refusing to grant her further leave to remain. She had
    applied on 23 January 2009 for leave as  a  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)
    [hereafter "PSW"] Migrant.

2.    The only basis the Secretary of State gave for refusing her  was  that
    she had failed to show she had the requisite level of funds  (�800)  in
    her bank account for the relevant period for three  months  immediately
    preceding 23 January 2009.

3.    The IJ considered whether the claimant could succeed under  para  245Z
    of HC 395 as amended on the strength of having been able  to  show  she
    had consistently had �800 or more in her bank account since 21 November
    2008.  He concluded she could not.  He went on, however, to  allow  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds.  It  is  appropriate  to  quote  from  his
    determination at some length [before him the claimant was,  of  course,
    the appellant].

         "17.     I have decided to allow the appeal on  Article  8  grounds
             because the inflexible application of  a  Rule  of  this  sort
             amounts  to   a   disproportionate   interference   with   the
             appellant's right  to  respect  for  her  private  life.   The
             appellant has a perfect record in relation to her  immigration
             history  and  her  studies.   She   has   obtained   permanent
             employment and is perfectly able to maintain herself.  It  was
             only because of her failure to realise the exact nature of the
             new requirements until November 2008 that she was not able  to
             meet the three month requirement, and by that stage it was too
             late, and there was nothing that could have  been  done  given
             the date of expiry of her leave.


         18.      The injustice in this case arises from Rules in which  any
             opportunity for discretion has been  removed.   This  kind  of
             situation cries out  for  somebody  to  take  a  sensible  and
             commonsense approach, looking at the overall aim of  the  Rule
             in question.  As  was  clear  at  the  hearing,  however,  any
             opportunity to exercise discretion has  been  removed  at  all
             stages  of  the  system.   The  civil  servants  taking   such
             decisions have had any power that they once  had  to  exercise
             such  discretion  taken  away.   Similarly  the  Home   Office
             Presenting  Officer  had  no  alternative  but  to  adopt  the
             position that she did.  Only in very rare cases  where  an  MP
             intervenes and the matter reaches a very high level  is  there
             some chance of discretion being exercised in a situation  like
             this.   In  addition  I  have  no   power   to   introduce   a
             discretionary element in the decision  under  the  Immigration
             Rules,  where  there  is  none.   For  a   number   of   years
             recommendations by Immigration Judges, where appeals have been
             dismissed, have not been  followed  as  a  matter  of  policy.
             Dismissing the appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  with  a
             recommendation that discretion should be exercised  to  depart
             from the Rules in this  particular  case  would  therefore  be
             unlikely to make any difference.


         19.      If there were some opportunity for the appellant to make a
             further in-country application,  once  she  had  the  required
             three month balance, then such  a  requirement  would  not  be
             disproportionate.  The possibility for  a  further  in-country
             application does not, however  exist.   This  is  because  the
             appellant's leave expired at the end of January and the  first
             date by which she had the three month minimum balance  was  21
             February  2009.   Any  further  in-country  application  would
             therefore be automatically refused, again with  no  discretion
             to the decision maker to do anything else.


         20.      As a result of this refusal,  and  of  this  appeal  being
             dismissed, the appellant would  become  an  overstayer.   This
             would have a number of possible adverse  future  consequences,
             and would blot her perfect immigration history.  Although  her
             leave has been extended during the appeal process  it  is  not
             open to her to use that extension of leave for the purpose  of
             making any further application.  Any overstaying  is  regarded
             as a serious matter in any  future  application,  whether  in-
             country  or  out  of  country.   Any   subsequent   in-country
             application, which would be automatically refused,  would  not
             attract her right of appeal.


         21.      The appellant would face considerable  disruption  to  her
             life in having to leave the country and  make  an  application
             for entry clearance to return.  The position  in  relation  to
             her job is uncertain.  Even if she  were  given  a  period  of
             unpaid leave, which would obviously be  inconvenient  for  the
             university as well as for the appellant, she  would  face  the
             difficulty of having to find another job in Kenya, and  ensure
             that she had the required �2,800 balance  for  a  three  month
             period.  All of this would have to be accomplished within  the
             twelve month deadline which would expire on 12 December  2009.
             The task might not be impossible, but it  would  certainly  be
             extremely difficult, and would amount  to  huge  inconvenience
             and expense for the appellant.


         22.      The respondent did recognise that the sudden  introduction
             of these Rules could cause  unfairness,  but  the  appellant's
             application  was  made  some  time  after   the   transitional
             arrangements, which waived the three month  requirement,  were
             withdrawn


         23.      Sullivan J (as he then was) in R (on  the  application  of
             Forrester) v SSHD [2008] EWHC 2307 (Admin) was considering the
             situation where a marriage settlement application was rejected
             due  to  a  bounced  cheque,  and  was  then   refused,   when
             resubmitted, on the grounds that it was out of  time  and  the
             applicant had become an overstayer. The Home Office refused to
             exercise discretion in that applicant's  favour.   Sullivan  J
             said the following:

                  "This is a classic example of  a  thoroughly  unreasonable
                  and disproportionate, inflexible, application of a policy,
                  without the slightest regard for the facts of the case  or
                  indeed elementary  common  sense  and  humanity.  Such  an
                  approach diminishes rather than encourages respect for the
                  policy in question."

         24.      I adopt those words,  with  respect.  This  is  a  similar
             situation. The current direction in the Immigration  Rules  is
             towards micro-management of every  aspect.  In  the  past  the
             rules would say that a person had to have  enough  funds.  Now
             they specify an exact figure, and also specify in exact  terms
             the evidence that must be shown. Discretion has  been  removed
             from the  decision-maker  and  from  the  appeal  stage.   The
             jurisdictional  boundary  for  a  statutory  appeal,  of   not
             straying into the area of discretion outside  the  rules,  was
             one thing when the rules were general, but it is quite another
             when they are so specific.  Now a matter  such  as  a  balance
             falling from �800 to �799 for one day in a three month  period
             becomes a departure from the rules.  What  is  needed  in  any
             decision making process is for a person to be able to exercise
             discretion in a sensible way in the application of any set  of
             rules to  the  facts  of  individual  cases.  If  the  initial
             decision-maker is not allowed to do it, neither is  the  Judge
             at appeal, neither is a decision-maker looking at the  judge's
             recommendation, and neither is a decision-maker looking  at  a
             further application, then the only room for  common  sense  to
             return  is  through  a  few  very  senior  civil  servants  or
             Ministers,  or a High Court Judge. Most people cannot hope  to
             get their cases considered at this level, and much  unfairness
             will result in individual cases.

         25.      It is for these reasons that I have decided, after  not  a
             little hesitation to turn to Article 8 as the only way out  of
             this dilemma, and the only way to produce a  fair  and  humane
             result. It has not been argued  that  the  appellant  has  any
             relationships in the UK that amount to family life.  The issue
             here is that all applicants have the right to  be  treated  as
             people, and any decision making seem  must  retain  a  certain
             amount of common sense, humanity, and flexibility in order  to
             recognise that those affected by the decisions made are  human
             beings, and have the right to be respected as  such.   In  the
             circumstances this refusal, despite the fact that it  complied
             with the strict requirements of the Immigration Rules, and the
             guidance, did not treat the appellant as a  person  worthy  of
             respect. It is  wrong  for  commonsense  and  humanity  to  be
             banished from any decision-making process.


         26.      The respondent is proposing to remove  the  appellant  and
             this is therefore, also, an expulsion case.   Considering  the
             five questions in Razgar I find the proposed removal would  be
             an interference with the  appellant's  right  to  respect  for
             private life. It would have consequences of such gravity as to
             engage Article 8.  This is because  of  the  consequences  for
             future in country or  out  of  country  applications  set  out
             above, and because the application  involves  the  appellant's
             future work experience and career prospects.  The interference
             is in accordance with the  law.  It  is  not  necessary  in  a
             democratic society  because  it  is  disproportionate  to  the
             public  end  sought  to  be  achieved.  A   recognition   that
             applicants who clearly are able  to  maintain  themselves  but
             have misunderstood the detailed evidential requirements should
             have discretion exercised in their  favour  would  not  damage
             immigration control in any way.


         Decision


         27.      The appeal  is  allowed  on  human  rights  grounds,  with
             reference to Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on  Human
             Rights."

4.     The  Secretary  of  State  successfully  applied  for  an  order  for
    reconsideration, bringing the matter before us. When we heard the  case
    on 2 February we sat of course as members of the Asylum and Immigration
    Tribunal. By virtue of legislative changes from 15  February  2010  all
    reconsiderations  still  undetermined   became   appeals   before   the
    Immigration & Asylum Chamber of  the  Upper  Tribunal.  Before  us  the
    Secretary of State is the appellant.

5.    The appellant's grounds contended first that  the  IJ  "had  used  the
    human rights legislation as a blunt instrument to defeat the removal of
    discretion in the Rules relating to Tier 1 migrants" whereas the  House
    of Lords had held in Odelola [2009] UKHL 25 that it  was  open  to  the
    executive to make Immigration Rules that remove discretion.  He had  in
    effect exceeded his jurisdiction.

6.    A second point made focused on the IJ's  statement  that  the  refusal
    decision constituted an  interference  with  the  claimant's  right  to
    respect for a private life having  grave  consequences,  in  particular
    "the consequences for future in country or out of country  applications
    ...". The grounds submitted that  such  consequences  were  irrelevant.
    They also maintained that the IJ was  wrong  to  treat  as  a  material
    factor the fact that the claimant was "worthy of respect".  And finally
    they argued that the IJ gave insufficient reasons  why  the  claimant's
    further work experience and career prospects  were  factors  justifying
    allowance of the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

Submissions

7.    On the excess  of  jurisdiction  point  Mr  Avery  for  the  appellant
    maintained that the IJ's reasoning betrayed a resolve to circumvent the
    will of Parliament expressed in Immigration Rules as could be seen from
    his reference to Article 8 as "the only way out of this  dilemma".   As
    to the IJ's reasoning in respect of Article 8, Mr Avery  said  that  it
    was clearly inadequate.  To say that  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal
    "would not damage immigration control in any way" was to set at  nought
    the public interest side of the Article 8  balancing  exercise  without
    adequate explanation as to why. To treat Article 8 as a way  round  the
    Immigration Rules served to undermine these Rules. To attach weight  to
    the claimant's future work and career prospects was  unjustified  since
    it was based on employment she had taken whilst  a  student.  The  IJ's
    reasoning was clearly contrary to the approach taken by the Tribunal in
    MM (Tier 1 PSW; Art 8; "private life") Zimbabwe [2009] UKAIT 00037.

8.    Mr Nicholson in response  argued  that  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    really doing no more than expressing annoyance and disagreement with an
    IJ decision.  The IJ clearly had kept within his jurisdiction; he  made
    that clear at para 16.  Odelola  was  not  in  point.   Parliament  had
    expressed its will not just through Immigration Rules but also  through
    the Human Rights Act.   Mr  Nicholson  further  pointed  out  that  the
    Secretary of State's criticisms wrongly implied  that  the  Immigration
    Rules struck the Article 8 balance,  whereas  Huang  [2002]  UKHL  made
    clear they did not.  As regards the adequacy of reasons, the  test  was
    an exacting one. It was not suggested or shown that the  IJ's  decision
    was perverse or that his  error  was  vital  or  crucial.  The  IJ  had
    correctly directed himself in  terms  of  the  structured  approach  to
    Article 8 enjoined by Razgar [2005] UKHL.

9.    Referring to Mr Avery's reliance on MM, it was  significant,  said  Mr
    Nicholson, that the claimant had a much greater degree  of  integration
    than MM had, having completed two university courses. For the  claimant
    to be deprived of the benefit of a favourable IJ decision would involve
    huge inconvenience and expense  for  her.   She  was  plainly  able  to
    support herself.  The claimant had  not  demonstrated  how  the  public
    interest was served by an adverse decision.  It was important  to  bear
    in mind the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in Miao  [2006]  EWCA
    Civ 75.

         "12. The latter question was described by the Immigration Judge  as
             involving the 'balancing exercise which is the essence  of  an
             assessment of proportionality', requiring him to  'accord  due
             weight to the competing interests'.  This may be right as  far
             as  it  goes  but  it  is  not   all.    The   assessment   of
             proportionality is not a simple weighing of two cases  against
             each other. It arises only when the claimant  has  established
             that he enjoyed a protected right  which  is  threatened  with
             violation: at that point the burden shifts  to  the  state  to
             prove that the involvement is nevertheless justified.   To  do
             this the state must show  not only that the proposed  step  is
             lawful but that its objective  is  sufficiently  important  to
             justify limiting a basic right; that it is  sensibly  directed
             to that objective; and that it does not impair the right  more
             than is  necessary.   The  last  of  these  criteria  commonly
             requires an  appraisal  of  the  relative  importance  of  the
             state's objective and  the  impact  for  the  measure  on  the
             individual.  When you have answered such  questions  you  have
             struck the balance."

10.   Even if the IJ made comments that might be read as  an  indictment  of
    the Points Based System (PBS) as a whole or the Tier 1 PSW Rules,  such
    comments, Mr Nicholson continued, were not integral  to  the  reasoning
    given for allowing the appeal.  He clearly envisaged that there may  be
    cases when the Tier 1 PSW rules would not violate Article 8.   Further,
    the current Rules did envisage that students could switch from  student
    leave to long-term leave or leave in Tier 2 categories.

11.   The IJ also gave a valid reason for declining to consider  whether  he
    could have achieved the practical result he clearly  desired  for  this
    claimant by way of making an extra-statutory recommendation.  What  was
    said about that at para 23 was entirely accurate.

12.   At  the  hearing  the  parties  were  also  asked  for  more  specific
    submissions on the relevance of OA (Nigeria) [2008] EWCA Civ 82 and MM.
     Mr Avery said the circumstances on OA  were  very  different;  it  was
    about continuation of studies, not post-study work.  MM clarified  that
    work itself is not fundamental to the private life aspects of a Tier  1
    case.  Mr Nicholson submitted that  OA  demonstrated  that  the  public
    interest in immigration control did not necessarily mean that  students
    seeking extensions could not succeed.  MM was much weaker on its  facts
    than either OA or this case.

Our Assessment

13.   Mr Nicholson  is  entirely  right  to  emphasise  the  limits  of  the
    Tribunal's error of law jurisdiction.  We are not to interfere with the
    findings made by an IJ unless they are vitiated by real errors of  law.
    We also consider that Mr Nicholson is right in saying that there is  no
    question that the IJ  acted  within  his  jurisdiction.  Indeed,  since
    Article 8 was raised as a ground of appeal it may well have given  rise
    to an error of law for him not to consider  it:  see  s.  86(2)(a);  s.
    84(1)(c) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.   We  do
    not consider that the  appellant  can  be  blamed  for  not  addressing
    Article 8 in the Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter,  since  the  claimant's
    application based itself solely on the  Immigration  Rules.   But  once
    Article 8 had been raised in the grounds of appeal, it was incumbent on
    the appellant at the hearing to explain why the  Article  8  claim  was
    resisted  (if  it  was).   However  we  consider  that  the   appellant
    discharged that responsibility.  The HOPO (Miss Shah)  is  recorded  at
    paragraph 10 as submitting that it was not disproportionate  to  expect
    the claimant to leave  the  country  and  apply  for  entry  clearance,
    particularly because her Article 8 claim  was  only  based  on  private
    life.

14.   All turns, therefore, on the legal efficacy of the IJ's  treatment  of
    Article 8. It is not suggested that the IJ was wrong to find  that  the
    right to respect for private life was engaged  by  the  facts  of  this
    case, nor is there any specific  challenge  to  his  finding  that  the
    decision amounted to an interference with that right.  The IJ  accepted
    that the decision of the Secretary of State was "in accordance with the
    law" within the meaning of Article 8(2).  Hence proportionality was the
    only issue.

15.   Turning first to consider the IJ's treatment of  the  public  interest
    side of the scales, the only specific reference he made to  it  was  at
    the end of para 26 when he stated that:

         "A recognition that applicants who clearly  are  able  to  maintain
         themselves  but  have   misunderstood   the   detailed   evidential
         requirements should have discretion exercised in their favour would
         not damage immigration control in any way."

16.   The IJ's reference to discretion is careless since if  a  decision  is
    contrary to a person's human rights, then s. 6 of the Human Rights Act,
    in conjunction with s. 86(2) of the 2002 Act  imposes  a  duty  on  the
    Secretary of State not to proceed with it; and s. 86(2) imposes  on  an
    IJ a duty to allow the appeal; but since any conduct of the  Article  8
    balancing exercise entails matters of judgment, we shall assume the  IJ
    meant only the latter.

17.   Even so, this passage  shows  a  grasp  of  the  Article  8  balancing
    exercise which is at best tenuous.  It does not  equate  (as  Mr  Avery
    appeared to argue) to a bald assertion that immigration control had  no
    weight in Tier 1 cases. It confines what it says to applicants who  (1)
    can maintain themselves; and (2) have misunderstood what  was  required
    of them by way of evidence. That said, (2) misrepresents the effect  of
    the introduction of the Tier 1 PSW scheme.  Precisely in order to  make
    allowances for applicants having to adjust to the new requirements  and
    have an opportunity to arrange their finances  in  time,  the  relevant
    Policy Guidance contained transitional provisions, which expired on  31
    October 2008.  All potential applicants have known since 30  June  2008
    that from 1 November 2008 new requirements for funds  were  instead  to
    apply.  From that date on, ignorance of the law was and is  no  excuse.
    The IJ appeared to note this fact at para 22 but then  promptly  forgot
    it, relying instead on a generalisation  treating  misunderstanding  of
    the relevant requirements as decisive  for  the  issue  of  immigration
    control. Possibly he may have been justified in considering  that  this
    appellant's misunderstanding was particularly important (see  para  8),
    but  that  is  not  what  he  did:  he  based  himself  on  a  sweeping
    generalisation about "applicants...who have misunderstood the  detailed
    evidential requirements".

18.   The passage also fails to recognise that the exercise he was  required
    to undertake consisted of  a  balancing  of  all  relevant  factors  of
    significance and that in any individual case ability  to  self-maintain
    and potential to misunderstand requirements of  the  Rules  and  Policy
    Guidance were not the only relevant factors.

19.   Anticipating that the Tribunal might  find  para  26  troublesome,  Mr
    Nicholson submitted that earlier in his determination  the  IJ  had  in
    fact given a further reason  why  the  public  interest  considerations
    should not  prevail which was within an IJ's remit  in  a  merits-based
    appeal. So we turn to this. In essentials the IJ's view  was  that  the
    relevant Immigration Rule (para 245Z) should not be considered to  bear
    any  or  any  significant  public  interest  weight  because  its  non-
    discretionary character created  an  inflexible  application  of  Rules
    which inevitably resulted in "much unfairness" in individual cases.  He
    had cited in support Sullivan J's observation in R (on the  application
    of Forrester) v SSHD  [2008]  EWHC  2307  (Admin)  which  considered  a
    situation where a marriage settlement application was rejected due to a
    bounced cheque causing the applicant to become an overstayer.  Sullivan
    J's comments made reference to  such  a  "thoroughly  unreasonable  and
    disproportionate  inflexible  application  of  a  policy  ..."  as  one
    diminishing  rather  than  encouraging  "respect"  for  the  policy  in
    question.  It was legitimate, submitted Mr Nicholson,  for  the  IJ  to
    have adopted those observations in the different context of Tier 1 PSW.

20.   We find it difficult to accept that the IJ was  right  to  equate  the
    situation arising when a person has an application refused for  failing
    to produce payment in proper form with that arising when a  person  has
    failed to produce the required evidence needed to show he or she  meets
    the substantive requirements of the relevant Rules.  Nor  do  we  think
    that  Sullivan  J  meant  to  enunciate  a  general  proposition  about
    Immigration Rules that are in non-discretionary form. In any event,  we
    cannot  see  that   his   Lordship's   reference   to   "respect"   for
    (governmental) policy was meant to imply that in his  view  any  policy
    fitting this description could have no public interest weighting.

21.   Mr  Nicholson  is  right  to  point  out  that  when  considering  the
    intention of Parliament and the need for the judiciary to respect  that
    intention one should consider not simply the Immigration Rules but also
    the Human Rights Act (HRA) (and related provisions in  the  Immigration
    Acts), but, as the higher courts have  repeatedly  confirmed,  the  HRA
    reflects the principle of the separation of powers and does not empower
    the judiciary to  usurp  the  will  of  Parliament.   (Of  course,  the
    Immigration Rules are not primary legislation and so can, in  principle
    be disapplied under the HRA, but that is not what this IJ sought to  do
    or would have been justified in seeking to do).  Mr Nicholson is  right
    that Odelola does not in terms deal with the status of the  Immigration
    Rules as an embodiment of the public interest; but their  lordships  do
    make clear that the Immigration Rules are to be seen as  an  expression
    of the will  of  the  Executive  acting  through  Parliament:  in  Lord
    Hoffman's words at para 6, "detailed statements by a  minister  of  the
    Crown as how the Crown proposes to exercises  its  executive  power  to
    control immigration".

22.   In short, the IJ's treatment  of  the  public  interest  side  of  the
    Article 8 balancing exercise was myopic and failed to take  account  of
    relevant considerations.

23.   We next examine the IJ's treatment of the other side of the  balancing
    exercise.  Once again we find fault, although here it consists not in a
    failure to take into account considerations so much as  in  the  taking
    into account of irrelevant considerations.  If one looks  to  see  what
    factors he attached weight to, one can see  four.  One  of  these,  the
    claimant's faultless educational record, we have no concerns about.  It
    was properly seen as a relevant element  of  her  private  life  claim.
    However, a further two are troubling and the other one at least  raises
    questions.  The first relates to her employment. That the IJ should see
    her work history in general as relevant is entirely understandable, but
    he appears to consider that her recent history was  one  of  legitimate
    "permanent employment" (para 17).  At para 7  he  had  noted  that  the
    claimant is: "now permanently employed on a permanent full-time  basis,
    as an international operations manager by the same university where she
    obtained her two degrees.  Her employment in this position  started  in
    October 2008".

24.   What he failed to  mention  was  that  in  her  application  dated  22
    January 2009 when asked  about  her  current  immigration  status,  she
    described herself as a "student writing up a thesis".  And the  further
    leave to remain she had been granted on 1 September 2008, as a  student
    until 31 January 2009 was "subject to a restriction on  employment  and
    recourse to public funds".  Thus the claimant was not someone  entitled
    during this period to undertake full-time  employment  on  a  permanent
    basis. We do not have enough information to decide  whether  her  full-
    time employment was at all times or at any time outwith  the  terms  of
    the conditions of her stay restricting her employment, since we do  not
    know if or when she had a holiday period, nor do we know what were  her
    hours of work (although we  know  she  was  awarded  her  degree  on  2
    December 2008).  What, however, is clear is that she had no entitlement
    to permanent full-time employment and no  expectation,  as  a  student,
    that she could undertake employment other than as part of  her  studies
    in accordance with  a  restriction.  The  IJ  effectively  equated  her
    employment position to  that  of  someone  who  was  entitled  to  such
    employment  under  the  Immigration  Rule  or  was  settled.   For  the
    Immigration Judge, to consider it relevant in such  circumstances  that
    the claimant would  risk  losing  her  employment  (see  para  21)  was
    improper. By the same token  it  was  also  improper  of  him  to  have
    attached weight to the  "inconvenience"  her  cessation  of  employment
    would cause to her employer.  An employer as much  as  an  employee  is
    required to comply with the Immigration Acts.

25.   It may be that there is also a difficulty about another reason the  IJ
    relied on - her ability to maintain  herself.  If  she  possessed  this
    ability because of her earnings from  full-time  permanent  employment,
    then arguably it should not have been taken  into  account  without  at
    least further exploration of her employment particulars.

26.   There is a related difficulty with the fourth reason on which  the  IJ
    placed considerable reliance.  He considered that  since  the  claimant
    had been or would be denied  a  "further  in-country  application"  she
    would become (upon dismissal of  her  current  appeal)  an  overstayer,
    which would in turn have "possible adverse future consequences" for any
    subsequent application.  However, what the IJ is here describing is the
    legal effect on any unsuccessful application of  a  failure  to  comply
    with the Immigration Rules.  The claimant had no expectation  that  she
    would be able to continue to stay lawfully in the UK unless she met the
    requirements of the Immigration  Rules.  If,  despite  failure  in  her
    application and appeal she chose to remain in the UK as an  overstayer,
    that would be her own choice.  She would be in  no  different  position
    than any other unsuccessful applicant. The IJ  has  totally  forgotten,
    when conducting the Article 8 balancing exercise, that regard  must  be
    had  to  the  extent  of  a  person's  foreknowledge   of   immigration
    difficulties or  precarious  immigration  status.   This  claimant  has
    always known her stay in the UK as a student was limited and subject to
    restriction.

27.   For the above reasons we find that the IJ materially erred in law.

28.   We do not consider this a  case  where  it  would  be  appropriate  to
    adjourn to hear or receive further evidence.   There  was  no  Rule  32
    notice under the 2005 Procedure Rules and we  have  all  the  requisite
    evidence before us.

29.   The only issue concerns Article  8.   In  considering  the  claimant's
    claim, which is based on private life, we have regard to the  case  law
    cited earlier, in particular Miao, MM, and OA.

30.   It is accepted that during her period of stay in the UK as  a  student
    the claimant has established  a  private  life  in  the  UK  with  some
    elements of significance.  It  is  not  in  dispute  that  the  refusal
    decision amounted to an interference with  that  right.  It  is  common
    ground here that the decision  was  in  accordance  with  the  law  for
    Article 8(2) purposes. The only issue concerns proportionality. Factors
    of relevance when considering the relative strength of  the  claimant's
    private life ties are that she has been in the UK since September  2004
    (5 years 3 months),  that  during  that  period  she  has  successfully
    completed two degrees, both at MA level  and  also  established  social
    relationships with fellow students and staff  at  Middlesex  University
    and that since October 2008 she has worked there  as  an  international
    operations manager. Up until her application for Tier  1  PSW  she  had
    been able to maintain herself without recourse to public funds.

31.   The claimant failed in her application for PSW migrant status  through
    being unable to show she had maintained the requisite  level  of  funds
    during the relevant  three  months  period  immediately  prior  to  her
    application in January 2009.  It was accepted by the IJ (and we see  no
    reason to call that that finding into question) that the  claimant  had
    failed to check what the new requirements were and so misunderstood the
    detailed evidential requirements.  She is not, therefore,  someone  who
    knowingly or wilfully disregarded the  requirements  of  the  Rules  or
    sought to flout  them  wilfully.  That  is  a  relevant  consideration.
    Nevertheless, given that she was in the UK in a temporary capacity  and
    was seeking to switch from being a student to a new work category which
    had not hitherto existed, she should have taken proper  care  to  check
    the requirements of the new scheme.  She  had  not  been  part  of  the
    scheme's predecessor, the International  Graduates  Scheme,  which  did
    envisage post-study work. Further, although she had formed ties through
    employment at the university, she must have known that  any  employment
    she took was subject to the restrictions on  employment  imposed  as  a
    condition of her student leave.  Leaving aside the issue of whether  in
    fact her university employment at all times was lawful, she could never
    have had any legitimate expectation of being able to stay  lawfully  in
    the UK unless she brought herself within the Immigration Rules.

32.   It was said by the IJ that to expect the appellant to return to  Kenya
    and make an entry  clearance  application  from  abroad  would  involve
    extreme difficulty and expense to her and inconvenience and expense  to
    the university.  But as already pointed out, her university  has  never
    had any lawful right to expect she could have been  employed  or  could
    continue in employment except if permitted to do so by the  Immigration
    Rules; far less that she could continue with them on a permanent basis.
     So far as concerns the claimant's private life, there is no reason  on
    the evidence to consider she would  be  prevented  from  continuing  to
    conduct her private life and form (or renew) social relationships  back
    in Kenya.  It is, of course, open to her to apply from abroad for  Tier
    1 PSW, but in weighing that factor it must be borne in mind that she is
    someone who has already had one opportunity, in-country, to apply under
    that scheme. Article 8 does not confer a right on  applicants  to  have
    the negative outcome to an in-country  application  for  work  reversed
    simply because it is inconvenient for them to return to  their  country
    of origin, particularly when they were only admitted to the UK in order
    to study and subject to restrictions on employment.

33.   We have had regard to the Court of Appeal judgment  in  OA  (Nigeria).
    We note in that case that the principal concern of the court  was  that
    the  refusal  decision  represented  an  effective  disruption  of  the
    appellant's student life and  that  given  the  considerable  financial
    investment the appellant had already made in completing those  studies,
    the decision to refuse to vary leave to  remain  was  disproportionate.
    In our view, the decision in that case was fact-sensitive  and  in  any
    event affords little assistance when considering the case of  a  person
    who has applied, not to complete studies, but to switch to  employment,
    in circumstances where she could only expect to be able to do so if she
    met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

34.   For the above reasons the Immigration Judge materially erred  in  law.
    We remake the decision as follows.  The claimant's appeal is dismissed.
