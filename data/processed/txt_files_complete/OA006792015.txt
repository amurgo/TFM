                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer (the ECO) appeals  against  a  decision  of
    Judge Jessica Pacey of the First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on
    1st September 2015.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FTT and I will refer to him as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a male citizen of Pakistan  born  5th  March  1985  who
    applied for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  to  enable  him  to
    settle here with his spouse [SB] to whom I shall refer as the Sponsor.

 4. The application was refused on 5th December 2014 on  financial  grounds
    as it had not been proved that the Sponsor had a  gross  income  of  at
    least �18,600 per year.

 5. It was claimed in the application that the Sponsor had employment  with
    Compass Group with a gross annual  salary  of  �15,660,  and  also  had
    employment with Sabina Hair & Cosmetics  (Birmingham)  Limited  with  a
    gross annual salary of �5,906.18.

 6. The reason for refusal was that the Claimant had not provided specified
    evidence to prove that the Sponsor's  employment  with  Sabina  Hair  &
    Cosmetics was paid into a bank account, as although bank statements had
    been provided, there was no evidence of the salary from that employment
    being paid into the account.

 7. The ECO also considered the application with reference to Article 8  of
    the 1950 European Convention on  Human  Rights  (the  1950  Convention)
    outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  but  decided  that  there  were   no
    exceptional circumstances to justify granting leave to enter the United
    Kingdom outside the Immigration Rules.

 8. The Claimant appealed  pursuant  to  section  82  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) and the appeal was heard
    by the FTT on 25th August 2015.

 9. The FTT found at paragraph 7;

         "7.  The issue is straightforward, relating solely to the  evidence
             of the  Sponsor's  second  income.   It  is  argued  that  she
             provided a P60 showing her earnings for 2013 - 14 as �3,274.89
             and a P60 for 2014 - 2015 showing income as �5,995.08 and  had
             explained that she was paid cash for that job.   There  is  no
             dispute that she earns the amount claimed from her second  job
             and I note that she now pays that income into the bank."

10. The FTT went on to find at paragraph 10;

         "In my view it is perfectly legitimate for the Sponsor to  be  paid
         in cash.  That being so, it is also reasonable that she  would  not
         automatically pay all his earnings into the bank on or  soon  after
         each pay day.  Had she done so it  is  reasonable  to  suppose  she
         would then have needed to withdraw the money for day-to-day routine
         expenses.  This is an  unnecessary  complication  when  it  is  far
         easier to retain some cash and pay into a bank account  that  which
         is not needed for immediate requirements."

11. The FTT made  reference  to  Sultana  [2014]  UKUT  00540  (IAC)  which
    contains guidance on the exercise of discretion by the initial decision
    maker, when specified evidence has not been provided.

12. The FTT noted that a refusal to exercise such discretion may render  an
    immigration decision not in accordance with the law

13. The FTT accepted the Sponsor's explanation that she was paid  in  cash,
    and that she did not deposit all of that cash into a bank account.  The
    FTT found that the requirements of the Immigration Rules were satisfied
    and the appeal was therefore  allowed.   The  FTT  did  not  go  on  to
    consider Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

14. The ECO applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  It was
    contended that the FTT had materially erred  in  law  by  allowing  the
    appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  when  the  specified  evidence
    required by the rules had not been submitted and  the  requirements  of
    the rules were therefore not met.

15. The ECO pointed out the requirements in Appendix FM-SE(1)(n)  which  is
    set out below:
    (n)  The gross amount of any cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the
         person's specified  bank  statements  show  the  net  amount  which
         relates to the gross amount shown on their pay  slips  (or  in  the
         relevant specified evidence provided in addition to  the  specified
         bank statements in relation to non-employment income).   Otherwise,
         only the net amount shown on the specified bank statements  may  be
         counted.

16. It was contended that the FTT had erred  in  considering  Appendix  FM-
    SE(D), which relates to the exercise of discretion, on the  basis  that
    the ECO was not obliged to exercise discretion, and in any event  there
    had been no request from the Claimant  that  discretion  be  exercised.
    Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Cruthers of the  FTT  in  the
    following terms;

         "(1) This  appeal  stands  allowed  by  a  decision  of  First-tier
             Tribunal Judge Pacey.  Having assessed the evidence, the judge
             concluded  that  the  appeal   succeeded   pursuant   to   the
             Immigration Rules, HC 395.  Although the judge refers  in  her
             paragraph 11 to the case of Sultana  and  Others  [2014]  UKUT
             00540, I have not found findings that would allow the 'Sultana
             ratio' to assist this Appellant (which is what the  Respondent
             suggests in paragraph 4 of  the  grounds  on  which  he  seeks
             permission to appeal).

         (2)  In summary, the grounds complain that on the evidence  it  was
             not open to the judge to find the  financial  requirements  of
             Appendix FM of the rules  (and  Appendix  FM-SE)  satisfied  -
             because  the  Sponsor's  bank  statements  did  not  show  the
             appropriate amounts paid in from  her  claimed  cash  earnings
             from her 'second job'.

         (3)  The grounds are arguable.  In particular, it is arguable  that
             there are good policy reasons for the requirement in  Appendix
             FM-SE  that,  in  these  circumstances,   a   Sponsor's   bank
             statements should  show  payments  that  correspond  with  the
             amounts that the Sponsor claims to receive as cash payments."

17. Following the grant  of  permission  the  Claimant  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008.  In summary it was contended that the FTT had not erred in law in
    allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.  It was accepted  that
    the salary from the Sponsor's second employment was  not  reflected  in
    her bank statements.  However, it was contended  that  there  had  been
    evidence from two independent sources, to confirm her income from  that
    employment, those sources being HM Revenue & Customs, and the Sponsor's
    employer's accountants.

18. Directions were issued that there should be a hearing before the  Upper
    Tribunal to ascertain whether the FTT had erred in law  such  that  the
    decision must be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Error of Law

19. Mr Mills relied upon the grounds contained within the  application  for
    permission to appeal.  It was submitted  that  the  judge  had  clearly
    erred materially, disregarding the specified evidential requirements in
    Appendix FM-SE.  It was accepted that the  salary  from  the  Sponsor's
    second employment was not shown in the bank statements,  and  therefore
    the FTT should have dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

20. With reference to Appendix FM-SE(D) and  Sultana,  Mr  Mills  contended
    that this was not a case where there had been any request for  the  ECO
    to exercise discretion.   In  any  event,  Appendix  FM-SE(D)  was  not
    applicable, as this was not a case where specified documents could  not
    be supplied.

21. Further, even if  there  had  been  a  request  for  discretion  to  be
    exercised, Mr Mills pointed out that the Entry Clearance Manager,  when
    reviewing the  application,  had  considered  discretion,  and  decided
    against that, giving reasons for that decision.

22. Further, if the FTT had found that the ECO had erred in not considering
    discretion, the appeal could only have been allowed on the  basis  that
    the refusal decision was not in accordance with the law.

23. Mr Mills pointed out that paragraph 7 of the FTT decision was wrong  in
    stating that there was no dispute  as  to  the  salary  earned  by  the
    Sponsor from her second  employment.   Her  salary  was  not  accepted,
    because the specified evidence had not been submitted to prove it.

24. Mr Mills submitted that the FTT decision disclosed a material error  of
    law and should be set aside, re-made and dismissed.

25. Mrs Masih disagreed, and relied upon  the  rule  24  response  and  her
    skeleton argument.

26. In summary it was contended that the FTT had not erred in law and  that
    independent evidence had been  submitted  to  prove  that  the  Sponsor
    earned the salary that she claimed from  her  second  employment.   The
    Sponsor had given an explanation as to why she did not pay that  salary
    into  her  bank  account.   Mrs  Masih  submitted  that  the  Statutory
    Declaration made by the Sponsor dated 13th June 2014 made reference  to
    the Sponsor being paid in cash from  her  second  employment,  and  not
    depositing all that cash into a bank account, because she used the cash
    for expenditure.  Mrs Masih submitted that this amounted to  a  request
    to the ECO to exercise discretion in the absence of specified  evidence
    and therefore the FTT did not err in law in allowing the  appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules.

27. After hearing oral submissions I found that the FTT materially erred in
    law and set aside the decision.  My reasons for so doing  are  set  out
    below.

28. The evidence before the FTT indicated that the requirements of Appendix
    FM-SE were not satisfied.  That is why the  application  was  initially
    refused by the ECO.

29. The Appellant had to prove that the Sponsor had a gross  annual  income
    of at least �18,600, and specified evidence needed to  be  produced  to
    prove this.

30. Paragraph 2(c) of Appendix FM-SE provides that personal bank statements
    must  be  submitted,  covering  the  same  time  period  as   payslips,
    confirming that the salary has been paid into a bank account.

31. In this case the bank statements submitted by the Sponsor did not  show
    the claimed salary from  her  second  employment  with  Sabina  Hair  &
    Beauty.  Therefore by virtue of paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE,  that
    claimed income could  not  be  taken  into  account  as  the  specified
    evidential requirements had not been met.

32. The FTT erred by allowing the appeal  outright  under  the  Immigration
    Rules,  notwithstanding  that  the  evidential  requirements  were  not
    satisfied.

33. There is reference to Appendix FM-SE(D) in the FTT decision.  If it was
    found that the ECO should  have  exercised  discretion  but  failed  to
    consider the exercise of that discretion, the FTT  had  the  option  of
    finding the decision to refuse entry clearance not in  accordance  with
    the law.  The effect of that would be that the appeal would be  allowed
    to the extent that  the  decision  was  set  out  aside,  so  that  the
    application remained outstanding before the ECO for a fresh and  lawful
    decision to be made.

34. The FTT did not take that course of  action,  but  allowed  the  appeal
    outright which is wrong in law.

35. In any event, the guidance  in  Sultana  makes  it  clear  that  if  an
    applicant wishes the initial decision maker to exercise  discretion,  a
    request should be made when the application is made.  I set  out  below
    the second paragraph of the headnote to Sultana;


         (2)  Where applicants wish to invoke any discretion of  this  kind,
             they should  do  so  when  making  the  relevant  application,
             highlighting the specific provision of the Rules  invoked  and
             the  grounds  upon  which  the  exercise  of   discretion   is
             requested.

36. I do not find that any such request was  made  with  this  application.
    The Statutory Declaration dated 13th  June  2014  simply  states  that,
    "Bank statements do not show the full amount of  cash  deposited  as  I
    used monies received from my part-time salary for  expenditure."   That
    is not a request for discretion to be exercised, and because there  was
    no request to exercise discretion, it could not be said that there  was
    a failure to consider the exercise of discretion.

37. In the alternative, which is not accepted, if the  FTT  found  that  if
    there was a request to exercise discretion, then  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager review makes it clear that the Sponsor's  failure  to  pay  the
    salary  from  her  second  employment  into  her  bank   account,   was
    considered, the Entry Clearance Manager finding "there was  nothing  to
    prevent her from depositing this money in the  bank  and  there  is  no
    explanation as to why she did not do so."

38. Having set aside the decision of the FTT, I was asked by Mrs  Masih  to
    proceed and re-make the decision.  I decided that it was appropriate to
    do so, and the decision needed  to  be  re-made  only  in  relation  to
    Article 8 on the basis that Article 8 had been raised as  a  Ground  of
    Appeal  to  the  FTT  and  not  considered.   The  decision  under  the
    Immigration Rules was dismissed because the specified evidence required
    by Appendix FM-SE had not been submitted.

Re-Making the Decision

39. The Sponsor attended the hearing and gave oral evidence,  adopting  her
    witness statement dated 11th August 2015.  In summary  the  Sponsor  in
    her witness statement confirms that she had genuine employment with two
    employers, and contends that she had submitted  sufficient  documentary
    evidence to prove this.

40. The Sponsor was questioned by Mrs Masih.  She stated that  if  she  had
    been required to provide further documents by the ECO  she  would  have
    done so.  She explained that because  the  Claimant  had  been  refused
    entry clearance, her life had been put on hold, and the  situation  was
    very stressful.  The  Sponsor  explained  that  she  and  the  Claimant
    married in 2012 but waited until July 2014 to make an  application  for
    entry clearance, because she needed to  find  a  second  employment  to
    satisfy the minimum income requirements.

41. When asked whether the Claimant could make  a  fresh  application,  the
    Sponsor explained that this would involve further delay and cost.

42. The Sponsor was cross-examined.  Mr Mills pointed out that she and  the
    Claimant were made aware by the refusal  decision  dated  5th  December
    2014 that the rules were not satisfied, and she was asked why a further
    application had not been made.

43. The Sponsor replied that she thought she had provided all the necessary
    documents,  and  therefore  there  was  no  need  to  submit  a   fresh
    application.

The Submissions of the ECO

44. Mr Mills submitted that the appeal should be dismissed  and  relied  in
    particular upon paragraphs 57 and 58 of SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387.
     I was asked to find that it was proportionate and reasonable  for  the
    Claimant to make a fresh application to satisfy the Immigration  Rules,
    and there were no compelling circumstances that would justify  allowing
    the appeal outside the Immigration Rules.

The Claimant's Submissions

45. Mrs Masih relied upon her skeleton argument in relation to  Article  8.
    I was asked to find that the minimum income  threshold  was  satisfied,
    even though specified documents had not been submitted, and  that  this
    was relevant when considering  proportionality.   Mrs  Masih  submitted
    that this application could not be  regarded  as  "queue  jumping"  and
    contended that SS (Congo) could be distinguished on the  facts,  as  in
    that case minimum income requirements were not met.

46. I was asked to take into account the delay that had occurred since  the
    application was submitted, and I was asked to find  that  it  would  be
    proportionate to  allow  the  appeal  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,
    pursuant to Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

47. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

48. I have taken into account all the evidence, both oral and  documentary,
    presented  to  the  Tribunal,  and  the  submissions   made   by   both
    representatives.

49. I have explained earlier in this decision, my reasons for finding  that
    the Claimant's appeal cannot succeed in  relation  to  the  Immigration
    Rules.

50. I set out below Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

         "Right to respect for private and family life
         1.   Everyone has the right to respect for his private  and  family
             life, his home and his correspondence.
         2.   There shall be no interference by a public authority with  the
             exercise of this right except such as is  in  accordance  with
             the law and is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
             interests of national security, public safety or the  economic
             well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder  or
             crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or  for  the
             protection of the rights and freedoms of others."

51. I have taken into account the guidance given in  SS  (Congo)  including
    paragraph 51 which I set out below;

         51.  In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light of the
             rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as  in  respect  of
             the substantive LTE and LTR rules in Appendix  FM.   In  other
             words, the same  general  position  applies,  that  compelling
             circumstances would have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or
             LTR where the evidence rules are not complied with.

52. I have approached my consideration of Article 8 taking into account the
    five stage approach advocated in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27  which  involves
    answering the following questions;

         "(1)     Will the proposed removal be an interference by  a  public
             authority with  the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
             respect for his private or (as the case may be) family life?
         (2)  If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?
         (3)  If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
         (4)  If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
             economic well-being of the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?
         (5)  If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             public end sought to be achieved?"

53. I accept that the decision in Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39 means  that  I
    have to consider the  family  life  of  the  Sponsor  as  well  as  the
    Appellant.

54. I find that the Sponsor and have Claimant have established family  life
    in that they are married.  They  wish  to  live  together  in  the  UK,
    although Article 8 does not bestow upon a couple, the  automatic  right
    to choose in which country they wish to live, if the Immigration  Rules
    can be satisfied.

55. I am however satisfied that Article 8 is engaged on the basis of family
    life.  I find that refusal of entry clearance is in accordance with the
    law as the Claimant cannot satisfy the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules.

56.  I  find  the  proposed  interference  necessary  in  the  interest  of
    maintaining  effective  immigration  control,  which  is  necessary  to
    protect the economic well-being of the country.

57. The main issue to be decided in this appeal, is  whether  the  proposed
    interference with the family  life  of  the  Claimant  and  Sponsor  is
    proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be achieved.

58. I take into account section 117B of the 2002 Act.  This  confirms  that
    the maintenance of effective  immigration  control  is  in  the  public
    interest.  It is in the public  interest  that  an  individual  seeking
    leave to enter the United Kingdom can speak English and is  financially
    independent.  There is no dispute that  the  Claimant  has  passed  the
    necessary English language test, but  financial  independence  has  not
    been proved because the evidential requirements of Appendix  FM-SE  are
    not satisfied.

59. I have considered paragraphs 57 and 58 of SS (Congo) which  in  summary
    indicate that the if the Immigration Rules are not satisfied, and it is
    suggested that they can be, the proper course of action is  to  make  a
    fresh application in order to satisfy the Immigration Rules.

60. I take into account the length of time that the  Claimant  and  Sponsor
    have been married, and their  wish  to  live  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    However I must also, when conducting a balancing  exercise,  take  into
    account the importance of maintaining  effective  immigration  control,
    and the weight that must be given to maintaining effective  immigration
    control.  I find that I must attach substantial weight to the fact that
    the Claimant and Sponsor cannot  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules.   My
    conclusion is that the appropriate course of  action  is  for  a  fresh
    application for entry clearance to be made, with the required specified
    evidence, to prove that the financial requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules can be satisfied.  I do not find it appropriate to disregard  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules, and I do not find that
    any compelling circumstances exist, which  would  justify  disregarding
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

61. The Respondent's decision to refuse entry clearance  is  proportionate,
    and does not breach Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FTT contained an error of law and was set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.

The Claimant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction was made by the FTT.  There has been  no  request  to
the Upper Tribunal for an anonymity order and I see no need to make such  an
order.
