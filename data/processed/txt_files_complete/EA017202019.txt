                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       1. This appeal comes before me following the grant of  permission  to
          appeal by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on 27 September 2019  against
          the determination of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  E  M  M  Smith,
          promulgated on 2 July 2019 following a hearing at Birmingham on 28
          June 2019.


       2. The appellant is a Ghanaian national born on 30 January  1981.  He
          entered the UK on 20 April 2004 with leave as a student  until  30
          April 2008. On 9 July 2007, he applied for a residence card  which
          was refused on 30 November 2007. On the 26  March  2008,  27  July
          2009 and 1 May 2010 he made applications for residence cards  with
          his cousin as a sponsor. All were refused.  On  4  April  2012,  7
          December 2012  and  26  October  2015  he  made  applications  for
          residence cards based  on  his  marriage  by  proxy  to  a  French
          national. Those were refused  too.  The  appellant  and  his  wife
          divorced in May 2015. They have no children. On 13 April 2017, the
          appellant made an unsuccessful human rights application. On 13 May
          2017, he made an asylum claim which was refused on 28 June 2017. A
          further residence card application was made on 28  June  2018  and
          refused on 6 February 2018. On 7  March  2018,  27  June  2018,  9
          October 2018 and  20  November  2018,  he  made  applications  for
          residence cards with his mother  as  a  sponsor.  Those  were  all
          refused. I have no information as to the reasons for any of  these
          many refusals.


       3. The most recent application was made on 26 January  2019.  It  was
          refused under Reg. 7 because the respondent was not satisfied that
          that the appellant was dependent upon his mother.


       4. The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Smith. He  heard
          evidence from the appellant and the sponsor and found  the  latter
          to  be  an  "unconvincing"  witness  who  "struggled   to   answer
          questions" put to her. He found that the sponsor's  bank  accounts
          showed monies that were in excess of what she claimed to earn  and
          that there were regular payments in and out which  suggested  that
          her account was used as a clearing account for  many  individuals.
          He also found that in view of the pattern of deposits and payments
          he could not  be  satisfied  that  the  monies  paid  out  to  the
          appellant were actually emanating from the sponsor as the payments
          followed deposits from a  third  party  of  the  same  amount  and
          because the sponsor's own income was insufficient to enable her to
          make such large payments to him especially when  she  had  herself
          and a teenage daughter to support. He concluded that  he  was  not
          satisfied as  to  the  source  of  funds  that  went  towards  the
          appellant's maintenance and was of the  view  that  the  sponsor's
          niece was "contributing if not  the  whole  but  in  part  to  the
          appellant's maintenance". He found that the appellant  lived  with
          the sponsor who paid the rent, but he was not satisfied as to  the
          running of the accounts or the source of the  funds.  Accordingly,
          he dismissed the appeal.


       5. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that  if  the  third
          party was only maintaining the appellant in part then the rest  of
          the maintenance would arguably have been from the sponsor  as  the
          appellant had claimed to have no other source of income.  Arguably
          also his living  circumstances  showed  his  dependency  upon  his
          mother.


          The Hearing


       6. The appellant was unrepresented but content  to  proceed.  He  was
          clearly familiar with the evidence, the determination and the law.
          He submitted that the judge had accepted that he  lived  with  his
          mother who paid the rent and that was enough under EU law for  him
          to qualify as a dependant as he had no other source of income.  He
          stated that the funds his mother paid to him were not just for his
          support but also to enable him to pay the rent and other bills  on
          her behalf as she did not speak English. He said the rent was ï¿½395
          per month and was paid at the start of each month.  He  also  used
          the funds transferred to him to assist his mother to buy materials
          for her mobile hair dressing business. He said he had  not  worked
          for three years as he had been  told  not  to  work  by  the  Home
          Office.


       7. The appellant said that his mother had an  account  with  Starling
          Bank, an internet only bank.  Until  recently,  when  transactions
          were permitted at post offices, no cash deposits could be made and
          so his mother gave her cash earnings  to  other  people  who  then
          transferred corresponding sums to her account. He provided figures
          for her  earnings  both  from  her  cleaning  jobs  and  from  her
          hairdressing business. He said that the income  declared  included
          expenses and so the profit was less than the sum declared.


       8. The appellant said he had been dependent  upon  his  mother  since
          2015.


       9. With  respect  to  the  judge's  finding  on  the  sponsor's  oral
          evidence, the  appellant  stated  that  evidence  had  been  given
          through an interpreter and it may  be  that  things  got  lost  in
          translation. Nevertheless, he stated that the judge  had  accepted
          that he lived with his mother, that she paid the rent and that she
          was exercising treaty rights. As  she  was  meeting  part  of  his
          essential basic  needs,  that  was  sufficient  according  to  the
          Secretary of  State's  own  guidance  for  him  to  qualify  as  a
          dependant under the Regulations.


      10. Mr Melvin  responded.  He  submitted  that  the  judge  had  heard
          evidence from the appellant and his mother. The appellant had made
          16 attempts to remain here and the judge had to carefully consider
          whether there was an abuse of the rules. He assessed the  evidence
          and found that it  was  not  credible  in  terms  of  the  tenancy
          agreement and the transfers of money.  He said it was unclear  why
          the sponsor had chosen to  open  an  internet  bank  and  why  her
          customers could not make payments direct into  her  bank  account.
          The judge had been concerned about the large amounts of money paid
          into the appellant's bank account and he found the sponsor  to  be
          unconvincing. He urged me to uphold the decision  and  to  dismiss
          the appeal.


      11. The appellant replied. He pointed  out  that  the  judge  had  not
          expressed any problems with the tenancy agreement and had accepted
          that the appellant lived with his mother and  that  she  paid  the
          rent. He said that the choice of a bank was up  to  an  individual
          and that Starling Bank had been voted best  UK  bank.  His  mother
          had, however, recently opened a Barclays account too. He said that
          due to the nature of her work she preferred cash  payments  rather
          than letting a customer make a BACS payment after the hairdressing
          session  had  been  completed.  He  submitted   that   the   money
          transferred to him was intended to  cover  rent,  food,  household
          bills and his mother's purchases for her  business.  He  said  his
          mother came to live in the UK in 2014.  He  helped  her  with  her
          accounts. He had studied accounting at Exeter University for three
          years.


      12. A request was made for an anonymity order.


      13. That completed submissions. At the conclusion of  the  hearing,  I
          reserved my determination which I now give with reasons.


          Discussion and Conclusions


      14. I have considered all the evidence and the  submissions  made.   I
          take note of Mr Melvin's submission that the  appellant  has  made
          some 16 applications to remain in  the  UK  and  that  care  must,
          therefore, be had to avoid any abuse of the rules. However, in the
          absence of any information as to why those applications  were  all
          refused, and nothing in the decision letter which would  point  to
          abuse, I cannot speculate as to the merit or lack of merit in  the
          previous applications or on whether there was  any  abuse  of  the
          rules and Regulations. It may simply be that the appellant did not
          provide the evidence to support the claims he made. Certainly,  no
          attempt has been made by the respondent to seek to remove him over
          the years that he has been making the applications.


      15. I also have regard to  the  judge's  concerns  over  the  numerous
          transactions made by the sponsor but note that there was  evidence
          before him, in the form of witness statements and oral evidence to
          explain them. Given that the judge accepted that the  sponsor  was
          earning an income  both  through  her  cleaning  jobs  and  mobile
          hairdressing,  there  is  no  reason  to  take  issue   with   the
          explanation that the sponsor's cash earnings were  paid  into  her
          account  by  bank  transactions  by  third  parties  due  to   the
          difficulty of making cash deposits into an online bank account.  I
          can  also  understand  the  sponsor's  reluctance  to  allow   her
          customers to make direct transfers to her  account  once  she  had
          completed work on their hair and left their homes.


      16. The respondent has not taken any issue with the sponsor's exercise
          of treaty rights and, therefore, it is safe to assume that it  has
          been accepted that she is making a living in the UK.  Although  Mr
          Melvin took issue with the sponsor's bank  of  choice,  I  do  not
          consider that has any bearing on the issue before me. No  previous
          challenge was  levelled  against  the  sponsor's  employment/self-
          employment and in fact Starling Bank has been voted  as  the  best
          British bank of 2019 as the appellant stated. Whilst the judge may
          not have been satisfied as to the sponsor's running of her account
          and the source of all the funds paid into it, he did  accept  that
          she was receiving an income from her cleaning jobs  and  from  her
          hairdressing business and that she was not in receipt of  benefits
          (at 23).


      17. Mr Melvin relied on the judge's dissatisfaction with the sponsor's
          oral evidence however the judge gave no reasons  for  his  adverse
          finding (at 29). Although he maintained that the  sponsor  was  an
          unconvincing witness who struggled to answer the questions put  to
          her, there is no clarification of what questions  were  put,  what
          the responses were or what was unconvincing about  her  testimony.
          It is not helpful for a judge to make  such  observations  without
          further explanation or clarification. The  record  of  proceedings
          records lengthy cross examination and lengthy replies.


      18. Although Mr Melvin's submitted that the judge found problems  with
          the tenancy agreement, I can find  nothing  in  the  determination
          which would support that. Indeed, the judge confirmed that he  was
          satisfied that the appellant was and is living with his mother (at
          21) and that she paid the rent (at 31).


      19. Having found that the sponsor was  in  the  UK  exercising  treaty
          rights, that she was the appellant's  mother,  that  she  and  the
          appellant lived together in the same household, that she paid  the
          rent,  and  that  another  relative   was   partially   supporting
          appellant, the judge went on to dismiss the appeal because he  was
          not happy with the running of the appellant's and  sponsor's  bank
          accounts. It was on that basis that permission was granted to  the
          appellant and it is on that basis that I conclude the judge erred.
          The error is material because it impacts on  the  outcome  of  the
          appeal and I therefore set the decision aside. No further evidence
          is required, and I now proceed to re-make the decision.


      20. I take account of the Judgment in Lim [2015] EWCA Civ  1383  where
          the court held: "...the critical question is whether the  claimant
          is in fact in a position to support himself  or  not...That  is  a
          simple matter of fact. If he can  support  himself,  there  is  no
          dependency, even if he  is  given  financial  support  by  the  EU
          citizen. Those additional resources are not  necessary  to  enable
          him to meet his basic needs. If, on  the  other  hand,  he  cannot
          support himself from his own resources, the court will not ask why
          that is the case, save perhaps where there is an abuse of  rights.
          the fact that he chooses  not  to  get  a  job  and  become  self-
          supporting is irrelevant"  (at  32).  In  the  present  case,  the
          appellant has no income of his own and there is no  evidence  that
          he has savings which he could have used to be self supporting.  He
          has not worked for some three  years  because  he  was  not  given
          permission to do so by the respondent. The evidence  shows  he  is
          reliant  on  his  mother,  the  EU  citizen,  at  least  for   his
          accommodation, as the judge himself found. That, as the  appellant
          rightly pointed out, is a basic need and that alone qualifies  him
          to remain as a dependant. Additionally, the judge found, that part
          of the maintenance which was said to come  from  his  mother,  was
          likely to come from a third party. As pointed out in the grant  of
          permission, however, that suggests that the remainder  of  support
          came from the sponsor.


      21. I also have regard to the respondent's guidance on EEA  dependants
          (of 24 July 2018) where it is made clear that "an  applicant  does
          not need to be dependent on the relevant EEA national to meet  all
          or most of their essential needs" (at p. 12).  Partial  dependence
          is sufficient.


      22. On the basis of the judge's findings, summarised in paragraph  19,
          the reasons above, the respondent's guidance and the case  law,  I
          conclude that the appellant has shown that he  is  dependent  upon
          his EEA sponsor for at least some of his essential needs. As such,
          he meets the terms of Regulation 7.


          Decision


      23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside.  I  re-make
          the decision and allow the appeal.


          Anonymity


      24. I make an anonymity order pursuant to the appellant's request.


      25. Unless and until a tribunal or  a  court  directs  otherwise,  the
          appellant is granted anonymity. No  report  of  these  proceedings
          shall directly or indirectly identify him or  any  member  of  his
          family. This direction applies both to the appellant  and  to  the
          respondent. Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to
          contempt of court proceedings.
