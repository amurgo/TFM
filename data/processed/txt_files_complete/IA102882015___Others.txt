Representation:
For the Appellants:    No representation
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants in this case appealed against a decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Pears who had dismissed their appeal.  Their appeal  was
    heard by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Juss who  dismissed  their  appeal
    against Judge Pears' decision but the appellants appealed to the  Court
    of Appeal who allowed their appeals to the extent of setting aside  the
    decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Juss dismissing  their  appeals
    to the Upper Tribunal.  The Court of Appeal also remitted  the  appeals
    to the Upper Tribunal for reconsideration.

 2. The result of that is that the appellants accordingly have  outstanding
    appeals before the Upper  Tribunal  following  the  grant  to  them  of
    permission to appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Pears.

 3. By a letter dated 27 November 2017 the respondent  informed  the  Upper
    Tribunal that she accepted that it would be unreasonable for the second
    appellant to leave the United Kingdom and that she  intended  to  grant
    leave to remain to the appellants.

 4. In directions given by Upper Tribunal Judge Gill and dated 28  November
    2017 the Upper Tribunal notified the parties that it was the  intention
    of the Upper Tribunal unless any request was received from either party
    to the contrary by 1:00pm on Friday, 1  December  2017,  to  treat  the
    appellants' grounds as unopposed and, on that basis:

      i) Set aside the decision of Judge Pears to dismiss the appeals;

     ii) Proceed to remake the decision on the appeals  without  a  hearing;
         and

    iii) Allow the appeal of the  second  appellant  under  the  Immigration
         Rules (para 287ADE(1)(iv)), the appeal of the first appellant under
         the Immigration Rules (Appendix FM and EX.1) and the appeal of  the
         third appellant outside  the  Immigration  Rules  on  human  rights
         grounds (Article 8).

     iv) The parties were notified that this appeal would remain on the list
         for today's date for  disposal  as  appropriate  having  regard  to
         paragraph 7 above.

 5. Before me at the hearing today, on behalf of the respondent Mr  Lindsay
    was content for this Tribunal to make the orders which the parties  had
    been notified would be made unless objection had previously been  made.
    Accordingly I re-make the decision as follows:



Notice of Decision

I set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Pears, dismissing  the
appellants' appeals and remake the decision as follows:

The second appellant's appeal is allowed under the Immigration  Rules  (para
276ADE(i)(iv)),  the  first  appellant's  appeal  is   allowed   under   the
Immigration Rules (Appendix FM and EX.1) and the  third  appellant's  appeal
is allowed outside the Immigration Rules on human  rights  grounds  (Article
8).



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
