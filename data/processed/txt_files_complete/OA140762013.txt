                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal has been brought by the Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Chennai
    against the decision of Judge Afako, a Judge of the First Tier Tribunal
    who, following a hearing at Taylor House on 22 July 2014,  allowed  the
    appeal  of  Mrs  Malaki  Pahalage,  named   as   respondent   in   this
    determination. The Entry Clearance Officer had refused her  application
    for entry clearance to settle in the United Kingdom as the spouse of Mr
    Nissanka Biddelama on the ground that the appellant was  not  satisfied
    that the respondent and sponsor (the  husband)  were  in  a  subsisting
    relationship as according to the appellant the parties to the  marriage
    had maintained contact following their marriage.  Secondly the  sponsor
    had not provided evidence of his gross annual income in  the  specified
    documents. Thirdly that the respondent had not provided evidence of her
    ability relating to English language.

 2. The Judge noted that the Entry Clearance Officer had now  conceded  the
    English language requirement.

 3.  Judge  Afako  heard  oral  evidence  from  the  sponsor  and  received
    documentary evidence. On the basis of the evidence before him the Judge
    said, "From the evidence I have heard and considered, I am prepared  to
    accept that the appellant is in a subsisting relationship." He went  on
    to say, "I accept that the sponsor has been in regular contact with his
    wife, including by Skype." He further finds," I  am  also  prepared  to
    accept that the appellant has been receiving money  from  her  husband.
    Such post decision evidence speaks to the nature  of  the  relationship
    and is admissible." Judge Afako then  went  on  to  determine  what  he
    called "The key outstanding issue". The Judge's consideration  of  this
    issue is set out in paragraphs 9, 10, 11 and 12 of  his  determination.
    He accepted the evidence of the appellant that his rental income  comes
    to �685 per annum out of which some is paid as cash in  hand  and  that
    the two tenants share a bedroom in the  same  house  that  the  sponsor
    lives in. He found the explanation given for not producing evidence  of
    the income in the specified documents  as  reasonable.  Adding  up  the
    salaried annual income of �11710 to  the  rental  income  of  �685  per
    month, the Judge concluded that the annual income of  the  sponsor  was
    above the �18600 threshold. In paragraph 12 of his determination  Judge
    Afako found, "Accordingly, the appellant meets the requirements of  the
    rules with respect to maintenance." The appeal was allowed as  per  the
    Judge's determination promulgated on 13 August 2014.  He  made  no  fee
    award and no anonymity direction was sought or given.

 4. On 13 August  2014  the  appellant  (Entry  Clearance  Officer)  sought
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. Whilst conceding  that  the
    sponsor's income  (the  husband  of  the  applicant  before  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer) current income 'does exceed  the  income  threshold,
    there is no reason to prevent the appellant making a fresh  application
    based on the sponsor's income at this time" asserts that  the  decision
    made by Judge Afako was in material error of law as he  had  failed  to
    show any regard to Appendix FM. The appellant (Entry Clearance Officer)
    was granted permission to appeal on 1 September 2014 by Judge Heynes, a
    Judge of the First Tier Tribunal in the following  terms  "The  grounds
    complain that the Judge failed to have regard to the  requirements  set
    out in Appendix FM-SE of  the  Immigration  Rules  relating  to  rental
    income."

 5. At the hearing before me Mr Whitwell amplified the written  grounds  of
    appeal. He argued that it was a material error on the part of the Judge
    to have taken into account the rental income of the sponsor as  it  was
    derived from his "main house". According to him the income came from  a
    room in the same building as was  used  by  the  sponsor  for  his  own
    residence. He asked me to  pay  due  regard  to  the  wordings  of  the
    relevant rule.

 6. Mr Solomon for the respondent spoke to his written skeleton  arguments.
    Mr Solomon reminded me that the ground advanced by the appellant was an
    "afterthought" to prevent the respondent from succeeding in his appeal.
    He pointed out that the sponsor and  respondent  had  been  honest  and
    transparent throughout in that they had relied  on  the  rental  income
    when making the application for entry clearance in March 2013. This  is
    proved by the terms of the declaration and  the  respondent's  covering
    letter in  support  of  the  application.  The  application  for  entry
    clearance had not been refused on the grounds that were being  advanced
    now. No such argument had been advanced before the Judge at  the  First
    tier Tribunal. It was not suggested to Judge Afako that  he  could  not
    take account of the rental income for the reasons now  advanced  before
    this Tribunal. It was note worthy  said,  Mr  Solomon  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was represented at the hearing before the First  Tier
    Tribunal. Mr  Solomon  argued  that  it  is  completely  wrong  to  now
    criticise the Judge for failing to deal with an  argument  or  a  point
    that was never raised before him and to suggest that this amounted to a
    material error of law in his decision.  Mr  Solomon  then  went  on  to
    explain and clarify the factual situation. He  said  that  the  sponsor
    owns the flat at  216  Bellgrove  Close.  The  flat  has  two  separate
    bedrooms as well as a living room. One of the bedrooms is rented to the
    two tenants who together pay him �685 per month for  the  use  of  that
    room. The income comes from renting a room and  not  from  renting  the
    flat. The sponsor has exclusive use of the room that he  lives  in  but
    the room is not his main residence. The sponsor had  not  let  out  his
    whole flat in which he continued to live  in  as  his  residence.  This
    situation, said Mr Solomon, is precluded by the rules but the Rules  do
    not preclude the sponsor from renting out a room  in  his  property  or
    from reliance on the income received from such rental  arrangement.  Mr
    Solomon submitted that there was no error in the determination of Judge
    Afako and his decision to allow the appeal  should  not  be  interfered
    with.

 7. In his final response Mr Whitwell said that a point of law can be taken
    up at any time and he argued that in  any  event  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer had mentioned this point on rental income in his letter stating
    reasons for refusal. With the first point I  broadly  agree.  With  the
    second assertion I find no  evidence  to  substantiate  the  assertion.
    Further more it is clear to me that the  representative  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer did not  raise  this  point  before  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal. There is merit therefore in Mr Solomon's  argument  that  the
    suggestion that  the  Judge  made  a  material  error  of  law  by  not
    addressing this matter  is  rather  unfair  as  no  such  argument  was
    advanced before him. I have a statutory duty under the Procedure  Rules
    to decide cases fairly and justly. It is also proven fact  as  asserted
    by Mr Solomon that the sponsor and the respondent have been honest  and
    transparent throughout in their dealings with the appellant as well  as
    the First Tier Tribunal.

 8. In my judgement a close analysis of the ground of  appeal  relating  to
    the rental income has no substance. The wording of the relevant rule is
    being construed by the appellant at this late stage of the  proceedings
    without good reason. Such construction is clearly not supported by  the
    wording of the Rule and nor  by  rules  of  common  sense.  As  far  as
    guidance to Entry Clearance Officers is concerned the legal  principles
    established by the case of Alvi take care of that. The Rule itself does
    not prohibit aggregation of rental income derived from one  room  in  a
    flat owned by the sponsor. It is perhaps noteworthy that taxpayers  are
    encouraged to let out a room in their property to  gain  tax  benefits.
    Moreover when you look at the overall picture, the respondent  has  now
    been found to be in a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  the
    sponsor. No aspersion is cast on the bona fides  of  the  marriage.  No
    factual objection is raised on the capacity of the sponsor to  maintain
    and support his wife in the UK. It is conceded that the  appellant  now
    meets all the requirements of the Rules and it is  suggested  that  she
    should make a fresh application to secure  her  entry  clearance.  This
    concession is demonstrative of the kite-flying propensity shown by  the
    appellant in this case. It also demolishes the  grounds  of  appeal  in
    that on the one hand it is argued that the Judge of the First Tier made
    a material error of law in adding up the income derived from the second
    bedroom in his flat and yet it is conceded that the respondent has  now
    met the requirements of the rules when factual situation on income  has
    not changed.

9.   For the reasons given above, I do not find any  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of Judge Afako and see no reason to  interfere  with  his
    decision to allow the appeal.  Judge  Afako's  decision  to  allow  the
    appeal of Mrs Malik M A L Pahalage is upheld. Further his directions on
    costs require no change too as do his directions on anonymity.
