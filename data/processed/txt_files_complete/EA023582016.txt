For the respondent:    Mr Stephen Kotas, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Decision and reasons

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier  Tribunal  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  decision  of   the
   respondent to refuse him a permanent right of residence following 5 years
   in the United Kingdom, pursuant to  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
   Area) Regulations 2006 (as amended), as the extended family member of  an
   EEA national exercising Treaty rights here.

2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.

3. The appeal was  struck  out  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  Sala/Khan
   grounds for want of jurisdiction.

4. Following the decision of the Supreme  Court  in  SM  (Algeria)  v  Entry
   Clearance Officer, UK Visa Section [2018] UKSC 9 on 14 February 2018, the
   respondent accepts that it was legally erroneous to treat  the  appellant
   as having no right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

5. The appeal of the appellant  is  therefore  allowed  and  the  First-tier
   Tribunal decision set aside.

6. The appeal will be heard substantively, and the decision remade,  in  the
   First-tier Tribunal.

DECISION

7. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:
   The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on  a
   point of law.
   I set aside the previous decision.  The decision in this appeal  will  be
   remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.
