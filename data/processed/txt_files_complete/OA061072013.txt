Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Westmaas, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appeals with leave against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Moore dismissing her appeal against the decision of  the
    respondent made on 24 January 2013 refusing her application  for  entry
    clearance to enter the UK as the child of a parent present and  settled
    in the UK under  paragraph  297(i)(e)  of  HC  395,  as  amended.   The
    respondent was not satisfied that the appellant's  sponsor  and  mother
    has had sole responsibility for her upbringing.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Ghana born on 30 June 1995.  She  is  the
    only child of her mother Ms Jane Bus-Kwofie, the sponsor.

3.   In her witness statement the sponsor said that she came to  the  UK  in
    February 1998 with a visitor's visa.  She applied for an  extension  of
    her stay after she met a man and  married  him.   The  application  was
    refused. The marriage broke down.  She  graduated  from  university  in
    2003 and at that time became an overstayer since she  had  no  visa  to
    study.  She was granted indefinite leave to remain  in  2010.   He  was
    given a naturalisation  certificate  in  January  2010  and  granted  a
    British passport in October 2012.

4.   At the time the sponsor came to the UK the appellant  would  have  been
    about 3 years old.  The sponsor left the appellant in the care  of  her
    mother, who brought her up.  The appellant saw her father for the first
    time in 2011 in Accra.  He visited  her  and  the  grandmother  at  the
    family home in Takoradi.  He has  seen  the  appellant  less  than  ten
    times.  This is partly because he was posted to Holland  to  the  Ghana
    High Commission and he worked there.  Since he saw  the  appellant,  he
    has given the sponsor about �100 a month to support the appellant.   He
    knows about the application for the appellant to come and live with the
    sponsor.  He does not object and has promised that should the appellant
    be granted permission to live in the UK, he would give the sponsor �400
    a month to support her.

5.   The sponsor said in her witness statement that although over the  years
    her mother has looked after the appellant, she has been the one who has
    made all the major decisions as regards her life.  She  sent  money  to
    her mother for the appellant's school fees,  doctor's  fees,  food  and
    clothing, and birthday parties.  It was because of her lack of visa  in
    the UK she could not go and visit her.  She has been  the  parent  with
    sole responsibility for the appellant.   Her  mother,  the  appellant's
    grandmother, has always asked first before taking any  decisions  about
    the appellant.

6.   The sponsor's mother's health was failing.  A medical  certificate  was
    submitted in support of her failing health.  The sponsor's mother needs
    a wheelchair and is  not  able  now  to  take  responsibility  for  the
    appellant.

7.   The judge considered  the  sponsor's  claims  to  have  regularly  sent
    monies to Ghana for the welfare of the appellant ever since she was  in
    the UK, and that meant since 1998.   He  found  that  the  sponsor  had
    failed to provide reliable  evidence  corroborating  this  claim.   The
    sponsor accepted that for a number of years  preceding  2003,  she  was
    studying and had little money herself, since her studies were paid  for
    by her family in Ghana.  The sponsor added that her own mother  stopped
    sending her money before 2003 and  before  she  graduated.   The  judge
    found it inconsistent and  to  be  implausible  that  the  sponsor  was
    relying on money sent to her from her family in Ghana when she  was  at
    university, but at the same time was sending money  to  her  mother  in
    Ghana.  There was no reliable documentary evidence from  the  sponsor's
    sister, or any friends, or other relatives that  on  any  occasion  the
    sponsor had ever given them any monies to take to Ghana for the welfare
    of the appellant.  He found such a claim to be a convenient one and not
    supported by reliable evidence.

8.   The judge noted that a number  of  money  transfer  receipts  had  been
    provided in support of the appellant's claim that the sponsor had  sent
    monies regularly to Ghana for  her.   Notwithstanding  that  the  money
    transfer receipts were fairly recent, the judge found  that  the  named
    receivers of those monies all have different names and none related  to
    the appellant or the appellant's grandmother, with whom  the  appellant
    lives.  The sponsor claimed that the  reason  for  this  was  that  her
    mother was unwell and it would not have been sensible to have forwarded
    the money directly to her.  Bearing in mind the age of  the  appellant,
    the judge saw no reason  why  the  monies  could  not  have  been  sent
    directly to the appellant over recent years.   There  was  no  reliable
    evidence showing that even if the appellant's grandmother  was  unwell,
    that she would not have been in a position to have used such monies for
    the day-to-day care of the appellant.

9.   The judge considered that there was clear evidence that  for  at  least
    the  last  two  years,  the  appellant's  father  has  been   providing
    financially for the appellant.

10.  The judge considered the sponsor's claims that she  has  paid  all  the
    school fees in respect of the appellant.  The appellant in her  witness
    statement also stated  that  her  mother  had  paid  the  school  fees.
    However, the sponsor had no letter from the school confirming who  paid
    the school fees, but according to the sponsor she would give  money  to
    friends who  were  returning  to  Ghana  to  give  to  the  appellant's
    grandmother for the grandmother to pay the school fees.  The judge  did
    not believe this evidence.  On the one hand the  sponsor  was  claiming
    that she  would  not  send  any  money  transfer  to  her  mother,  the
    grandmother, because she was not capable and was  unwell,  but  on  the
    other hand, the sponsor was willing to give cash  to  people  who  were
    returning to Ghana and for those people to give  those  monies  to  the
    appellant's grandmother for the grandmother to pay the fees.  The  lack
    of any evidence from the school satisfied him that the sponsor had  not
    been responsible for paying school fees.

11.  The judge found that whilst  he  was  satisfied  that  there  had  been
    regular telephone contact between the appellant and  the  sponsor  over
    many years, this on its own did not constitute sole responsibility.  He
    was not satisfied that the sponsor has regularly  financially  provided
    for the appellant and he was not satisfied that she is the  person  who
    has exercised control and direction over her daughter.

12.  The  judge  was  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  has  only  had  limited
    involvement, mainly by telephone and two  visits  to  Ghana,  with  the
    appellant.  He was not satisfied that the  sponsor  has  exercised  the
    relevant direction and control over the appellant, who has  lived  with
    her grandmother since the sponsor came to the UK when the appellant was
    3 years of age.

13.  The grounds asserted that the judge  erred  when  he  linked  financial
    responsibility to sole responsibility,  in  the  parental  sense.   The
    judge concentrated on the father's financial contribution, which is not
    evidence of sole responsibility and ignored evidence of the appellant's
    mother.  The evidence of the appellant's mother  was  not  accepted  as
    regards finances, but  there  were  no  findings  on  the  evidence  of
    contact, changing health of the mother, the mother's witness  statement
    and the statement from the appellant, referring to her father: "He  has
    never been there for me or my mother.  He did not see me when I  was  a
    child and he did not send me any financial  support  either.   I  don't
    really know him very well."  Further, even if the grandmother did  have
    responsibility for the appellant when she was  younger,  the  situation
    changed in the light  of  the  ill  health  of  the  grandmother.   The
    statement of the mother that  her  mother  had  helped  her,  that  any
    decisions were checked with her first, was consistent with  the  mother
    having sole responsibility.

14.  I accept the argument that most of the judge's decision  was  based  on
    who was making financial contributions towards the child's  upbringing.
    I also accept Counsel's  argument  that  financial  contribution  while
    important is not the determinative factor.  Accordingly,  I  find  that
    the judge erred in law for the reasons set out  in  the  grounds.   The
    judge's decision should be set aside and remade.

15.  Mr. Westmaas said I could determine the appeal myself on the  basis  of
    the evidence before me, which is what I shall now do.

16.  In TD (Paragraphs 297(i)(e): "sole responsibility") Yemen [2006]  UKAIT
    00049, the Upper Tribunal analysed all the leading Tribunal  decisions,
    Court of Appeal cases and held as follows in its head note:

         "Sole responsibility" is a factual matter to be  decided  upon  all
    the evidence.  Where one part is not involved in the child's upbringing
    because he (or she) had  abandoned  or  abdicated  responsibility,  the
    issue may arise between the remaining parent and others who have day-to-
    day care of the child abroad.  The  test  is  whether  the  parent  has
    continuing control and direction over the child's upbringing, including
    making all the important decisions in the child's life.  However, where
    both  parents  are  involved  in  a  child's  upbringing,  it  will  be
    exceptional that one of them will have "sole responsibility".

17.  On the evidence I find that the father's recent provision of  financial
    support  does  not  amount  to  sole  responsibility  or  even   shared
    responsibility for the care of the appellant.  I accept the appellant's
    evidence as contained in her statement and relied  on  in  the  grounds
    that her father has never been there for her or her  mother.   She  did
    not see him when she was a child and he did not send her any  financial
    support either and that she does not really know him very well.

18.  The appellant was left with her grandmother from the age of 3.  The  UT
    in TD said that as a matter of common sense,  some  responsibility  for
    the child's life must rest with the carer in  the  country  of  origin.
    The sponsor in her witness  statement  accepted  that  her  mother  has
    brought up the appellant, which chimes with what the UT said in TD.

19.  The sponsor said that she has been the  one  who  has  made  all  major
    decisions as regards the appellant's life.  She said  that  her  mother
    helped but she always asked her first before making any decisions about
    the appellant.  Her evidence is supported by the  appellant's  evidence
    in her  witness  statement  that  the  sponsor  chose  her  school  and
    everything else.  Her mother sent money to her grandmother  to  support
    her and pay schools fees.  On the question of financial remittances,  I
    do not hold against  the  appellant  that  the  remittances  were  sent
    through different people as I take judicial notice  of  the  fact  that
    this is how many Ghanaians in the UK send monies to their relatives  in
    Ghana.

20.  In light of the documentary evidence, I find that the sponsor has  been
    in regular telephone contact with the appellant. This is  supported  by
    the appellant's evidence that the sponsor  was  always  on  the  phone,
    sometimes three times a day.  I find that this is strong evidence which
    indicates that the sponsor has exercised  the  relevant  direction  and
    control over the appellant.  There is was no evidence before me  as  to
    why the sponsor did not make the application for the appellant to  join
    her in the UK when she visited the appellant in 2010. By then  she  had
    been granted indefinite leave to remain.   Nevertheless  the  sponsor's
    two visits, six weeks in August 2010  and  seven  weeks  in  July  2012
    establish the sponsor's  desire  to  have  physical  contact  with  the
    appellant once more, after a long absence.

21.  The appellant was 17 years old when she made the application for  entry
    clearance.  I accept in light of the letter dated 18 November 2013 from
    Dr  Otubuah  that  the  appellant's  grandmother  is  hypertensive  and
    diabetic.  She is 80 years old and is currently immobile and goes about
    her daily chores in a wheelchair.  The grandmother stated in her letter
    of 23 October 2013 that due to old age and poor health which  has  left
    her wheelchair bound, she could not continue to fulfil the role  of  an
    active parent in her granddaughter's life.  I do  not  find  that  this
    evidence adds much to the appellant's claim because at the age of 17 at
    the date of the ECO's decision, the appellant was  old  enough  not  to
    require the kind of care the grandmother would have given to  her  when
    she was much younger.  This finding does not detract from  my  positive
    findings.

22.  I find on the evidence before me that  the  sponsor  did  not  abdicate
    responsibility for the appellant.  She sent money to  her  mother  when
    she could for the care of the appellant.  Through her regular telephone
    calls  she  exercised  continuing  control  and  directions  over   the
    appellant's upbringing, including making all the important decisions in
    the appellant's life.

23.  I allow the appellant's appeal.
