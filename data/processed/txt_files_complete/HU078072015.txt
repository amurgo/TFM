Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Mohammed, Kingstons Solicitors (Newcastle)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 24th December 1982.   He
    made entry clearance as a partner under Appendix  FM  of  Statement  of
    Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395, as amended ("immigration rules").



2.   The Entry Clearance Officer believed that the appellant could not  meet
    the requirements of Appendix M and in particular:-

         ".   It was considered that the  Appellant  could  not  demonstrate
             that the income threshold requirement under  Appendix  FM  was
             met and/or the related evidential requirement  under  Appendix
             FM-SE.


         .    The Appellant was expected to demonstrate  that  the  required
             gross income of �18,600 could be met.


         .    The Appellant had failed to  provide  the  required  documents
             under appendix  FM,  namely  wage  slips  confirming  (i)  the
             person's employment and gross annual salary; (ii)  the  length
             of their employment; (iii) the period over which they had been
             or  were  paid  the  level  of  salary  relied  upon  in   the
             application; and (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed
             term contract or agency).


         .    A contract of employment was submitted but  not  the  required
             accompanying letter demonstrating the necessary detail."

3.   The application was refused by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  on  10th
    September 2015, and the appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.



4.   His appeal was heard at King's Court, North Shields  on  21st  December
    2016, by First-tier Tribunal Judge S T Fox.

5.   The judge dismissed the  appeal,  finding  both  the  sponsor  and  the
    sponsor's employer not credible.  He was not satisfied on the  evidence
    that the appellant was entitled to entry clearance  and  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal.

6.   The appellant appealed, claiming that the judge erred  in  finding  the
    sponsor's credibility to be damaged, because the judge failed  to  take
    into  account  independent  evidence  provided  by  the  employer,  the
    employer's  accountant  and  a  verification  report  provided  by  the
    respondent  confirming  the  sponsor's  employment  income.    It   was
    suggested that no  appropriate  reasons  were  given  for  finding  the
    employer not to be credible.

7.   Addressing me today, Mr Mohammed suggested that  the  judge  had  taken
    the wrong calculation, when at paragraph 22 of  the  determination,  he
    records that the sponsor said that she earned between  �7  and  �8  per
    hour and that Mr Hussain confirmed the same figure.   At  paragraph  23
    the judge believes that at �7 per hour, working a  40  hour  week,  the
    sponsor would earn �14,560 per annum in a 52 week working year.  At  �8
    per hour she would earn �16,640 per annum and that at  �7.68  per  hour
    she would earn �15,974.40 per  working  year.   However,  submitted  Mr
    Mohammed, the judge had before him a verification report produced by UK
    Visas & Immigration from information provided by HM Customs  &  Excise.
    This showed that the appellant had a record of earnings with  Morrisons
    of �310.80, a total pay from Solomon's Cuisine Limited of �9,349.89 and
    that the Solomon's Cuisine Limited employment start date was 6th  April
    2014.  The most recent pay was �1,558.33 on 30th June 2015 and that, he
    said, shows a  total  income  of  �18,699.96  which,  he  claimed,  was
    sufficient to satisfy the Rules.  She started work on 6th October 2014,
    so that the total  pay  referred  to  in  the  verification  report  of
    �9,349.98 related to a six month period.  If that is  doubled  then  of
    course it gives one the yearly figure which satisfies  the  immigration
    rules.

8.   Mr Mohammed suggested that there were also bank  statements  which  had
    been submitted to the Entry Clearance Officer, but since these were not
    challenged by the Entry Clearance Officer they were not  placed  before
    the judge.  Mr Mohammed pointed out that Mr Hussain, the employer,  had
    given evidence suggesting that the sponsor was paid at the  lower  rate
    of pay of �18,700, rather than the national average of �21,000, because
    she had a lack of experience and lacked training.

9.   The judge had criticised the evidence of Mr Hussain, because the  claim
    that the job needed to be filled quickly because there was  demand  for
    such a position, conflicted with the appellant's decision to take a six
    week holiday to go to Pakistan and marry.  Shortly, thereafter she went
    on nine months maternity leave and Mr Hussain's evidence  was  that  he
    and his brothers, "took up the  slack"  generated  by  the  appellant's
    absence.  The judge found that that evidence that the position required
    filling did not sit well with the evidence that  prolonged  periods  of
    absence could be facilitated  by  the  company  for  holidays  and  for
    maternity leave, without hiring a temporary worker to take over  during
    the maternity period.

10.  Mr Bates drew my attention to  paragraph  8  of  the  determination  in
    relation to the documents, some of which were only received on the  day
    of the hearing.   There were three letters from the sponsor's employer,
    confirming her salary of �18,700.  The respondent had not accepted that
    the sponsor was  qualified  for  the  post  she  currently  held  of  a
    restaurant manager.  Her reasons for that were put to the appellant  in
    cross-examination.  The sponsor gave oral evidence that she learned  of
    the job through friends and family.  The judge noted that  she  claimed
    that her family did not know Mr Hussain of  Solomon's  Cuisine  Limited
    however, in his statement Mr Hussain claimed to know of the appellant's
    family.  This inconsistency was  not  addressed  by  the  appellant  or
    representatives.  The judge noted Mr Hussain's evidence  that  she  had
    been given two extra weeks holiday with pay rather than the four  weeks
    holiday according to her contract, because she was a good  worker.   In
    evidence when she was asked how much she was paid, she said she thought
    it was between �7 and �8 per hour and Mr  Hussain  confirmed  the  same
    figure.  The sponsor then believed it was some �7.68 per hour.   If  in
    fact she was paid �18,700 per year, it is curious that both she and  Mr
    Hussain should have attempted to explain her income in terms of  hourly
    wage, rather than as annual salary.  The judge did not believe  it  was
    credible that the employer would allow the sponsor to go on six  months
    holiday and then take nine months  maternity  leave  without  employing
    additional staff and simply  by  managing  because,  "brothers  rallied
    round".

11.  I reserved my determination.

12.  There were three letters before the judge  from  Solomon's  Cuisine  to
    show that the sponsor earned �18,700 per annum.  He also had  a  letter
    from the employer's  accountants  in  which  they  confirmed  the  same
    earnings.   Unfortunately,  they  say  that   the   sponsor   commended
    employment on 1st October 2014, rather than  6th  October  2014.   This
    evidence was contradicted by the oral evidence of the sponsor  and  her
    employer.

13.   The  sponsor  gave  oral  evidence  to  the  judge  but  unfortunately
    contradicted  herself  on  several  occasions.   She  was  warned  that
    credibility was an issue in the appeal,  but  the  respondent  did  not
    accept that the sponsor was qualified for the post  she  held  and  the
    sponsor and Mr Hussain were inconsistent  as  to  whether  or  not  the
    sponsor's family knew Mr Hussain.

14.  I find it curious that  when  asked  how  much  she  was  earning,  the
    sponsor replied by quoting �7 or �8 per hour  rather  than  her  yearly
    salary of �18,700 if, in fact, that is what  she  was  being  paid.   I
    found it curious also that the employer gave a similar  answer  instead
    of simply quoting the yearly wage.  The judge was entitled to find that
    if  the  position  occupied  by  the  sponsor   required   filling   so
    evidentially as claimed, it did not sit well with the  evidence  before
    him that prolonged periods of  absence  could  be  facilitated  by  the
    company for a holiday and maternity leave.  There was no evidence  that
    during this maternity leave another employee was employed to cover  for
    the sponsor's absence.  The judge felt that when that  was  taken  into
    account, along with the sponsor's lack of experience in  the  food  and
    service industry as a waiter or a manager, the credibility was damaged.
     At paragraph 28 the judge is critical of the employer by claiming that
    he "appears to be trying very hard to compliment the  evidence  of  the
    sponsor".   Both  witnesses  gave  evidence  that  conflicts  with  the
    documentary evidence, particularly regarding the claimed earnings.  The
    judge was entitled to have doubts that these documents  can  be  relied
    upon.

15.  Mr Bates suggested that the verification report was very clearly  taken
    into account by the judge and that his  reference  to  the  documentary
    evidence  includes  the  verification  report.   However,   since   the
    verification report itself was compiled from evidence  provided  by  Mr
    Hussain to HM Revenue & Customs and since he has been found not  to  be
    credible, it follows, suggested Mr Bates, that the verification  report
    cannot be relied upon.

16.  I am satisfied that the judge was entitled to make the findings he  did
    on the evidence before him.  There is no perversity on his part in  the
    public law sense.  The witnesses clearly contradicted  the  documentary
    evidence and he was entitled to find that the oral evidence before  him
    could not be relied upon.  Since  the  evidence  from  HM  Revenue  and
    Customs was prepared on  the  basis  of  information  supplied  by  the
    sponsor's employer, who had been found by the judge not to be credible,
    he was entitled not to place reliance on it.

17.  I believe that the making of the determination by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Fox did not involve the making of an error on a material point of
    law.  I uphold his appeal.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

There is no order for anonymity.
