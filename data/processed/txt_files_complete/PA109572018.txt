For the Appellant:     Mr Sadiq, Adams Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq. He appeals against the decision of
    the  Respondent  dated  31st  August  2018  to  refuse  to  grant   him
    protection.


 2. The basis of the Appellant's claim is that he has a  well-founded  fear
    of persecution in Iraq  for  reasons  of  his  political  opinion.  The
    Appellant is an artist who in 2018 staged an  exhibition  in  Liverpool
    incorporating the writings of  Kurdish journalists who had been  killed
    as a result of their work.   Around the time that this  exhibition  was
    staged, three things happened that caused the Appellant to fear for his
    life if he returned to Iraq. The first was that on the 29th March  2018
    the Appellant received a call  on  his  mobile  telephone  from  a  man
    identifying himself as Rahman. Rahman threatened to kill him. This call
    was accompanied by further abusive text messages  and  voicemails  left
    over the messaging app Viber. The second thing that happened  was  that
    in April 2018 the Appellant's home in Iraq received a visit  from  some
    men. The Appellant's mother was at home at the time and she reported to
    the Appellant that she believed the men to be from either  the  PUK  or
    KDP: she deduced this from the fact  that  they  refused  to  introduce
    themselves and carried a weapon.  Finally,  the  Appellant  started  to
    receive messages from a journalist at a KDP-run television station. One
    of the questions the journalist had for him was about when he was going
    to return home. This accumulation of events around the same time as his
    exhibition in Liverpool led the Appellant to form the  view  that  they
    were all connected. He believes that the authorities in the Independent
    Kurdish Region are opposed to his work and that someone wants him  dead
    or otherwise silenced.   He fears for his life in the IKR, and  submits
    that as a Kurd there are no reasonable internal flight alternatives for
    him anywhere else in Iraq.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal  did  not  find  the  claimed  threats  to  the
    Appellant to be credible, or the overall account to  be  plausible.  It
    dismissed the appeal.

 4. Following a hearing on the 2nd March 2020 I set that decision aside. In
    a decision dated the 11th March 2020 I gave detailed reasons  why.  The
    errors of law in the First-tier Tribunal decision can be summarised  as
    essentially errors of fact, and  a failure to  take  material  evidence
    into account, compounded by procedural unfairness in that the Appellant
    was not given an opportunity to address the points that  had  concerned
    the Tribunal. For instance, the Tribunal weighed against the  Appellant
    its belief that he did not have a return ticket booked home.  This  was
    an error, because he did.  The Tribunal weighed against  the  Appellant
    the lack of explanation as to how Rahman was able to find his telephone
    number: this failed to take account of the  fact  that  this  telephone
    number appeared on the Appellant's open Facebook page.  Further adverse
    inference was drawn from the lack of threats arising from an exhibition
    staged in Iraq: this was again a misunderstanding of  the  evidence  on
    the part of the judge, because  in  fact  that  exhibition  never  went
    ahead, the gallery owner having expressed concern about  the  potential
    consequences if it did.  The First-tier Tribunal  found  all  of  these
    adverse points, weighed cumulatively, to be fatal  to  the  Appellant's
    case. All of them could have been resolved in the  Appellant's  favour,
    had he or his Counsel had the opportunity  to  address  the  Tribunal's
    concerns.


 5. Immediately following my written decision setting the decision  of  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  aside  the  United  Kingdom  went  into  lockdown
    necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Unfortunately  this  led  to  a
    significant delay in listing, which is to be regretted. At the  hearing
    on the 25th May 2021 I was however able to hear the Appellant give oral
    evidence, and the helpful submissions of both  representatives  on  how
    the decision should be 're-made'. I reserved my decision, which  I  now
    give.




    The Evidence


 6. The Appellant claimed asylum in the UK  on  the  4th  April  2018.  The
    evidence before me relating to the Appellant's  personal  circumstances
    falls into three parts:


              i)  Written  evidence,  consisting  of  note   taken   by   an
                 immigration officer at the screening interview conducted on
                 the 14th April 2018,  his  undated  asylum  interview,  and
                 three witness statements signed respectively  on  the  10th
                 October 2018,  18th November 2019 and the 18th May 2021


             ii)  Corroborating  documents   including   evidence   of   the
                 Appellant's career in  art,  newspaper  reports  about  the
                 journalists whose murders featured  in  his  work,  threats
                 received by text message and contact from  the  Kurdish  TV
                 station


            iii) Testimony at hearing


 7. The Appellant is a Kurd from Sulaymaniyah.   As a young man  he  became
    interested in art because of an elder  brother  who  was  then  an  art
    student. In 1996 he was enrolled at the Institute of Fine Arts in  Iraq
    and he graduated from university in 2005. In 2008 the Iraqi Ministry of
    Higher Education awarded him  a  scholarship  to  pursue  post-graduate
    studies in the United Kingdom. The Appellant obtained a UK student visa
    in November 2007 and this  was  successively  extended  until  November
    2013, during which  time  the  Appellant  attended  the  University  of
    Cardiff.  He returned to Iraq in October 2013 in order  to  take  up  a
    position as a lecturer in fine art at the University  of  Sulaymaniyah.
    He explains that although the Ministry  had  further  offered  to  fund
    doctoral studies in the UK he decided to take up the job offer  at  the
    University because it was a good opportunity for him.


 8. In his oral evidence the Appellant  explained  how  despite  his  early
    training in fine art, his work has moved away from  painting  over  the
    years and he now  works  as  a  conceptual  artist,  primarily  through
    installations. Although the Appellant does not describe himself  as  an
    activist, his work is often political in theme. He has explored  issues
    around the failure of the Kurdish leadership, the Kurdish diaspora  and
    corruption.  His final Masters exhibition, staged in Cardiff  in  2011,
    for instance questioned the competency  of  Jalal  Talabani  and  other
    Kurdish politicians through  devices  such  as  the  deconstruction  of
    traditional Kurdish slippers. He is currently working on a piece  based
    on Carl Andrï¿½'s 'Equivalent VIII' ('Bricks').  Instead  of  a  pile  of
    bricks, the structure will be made of journals containing  the  writing
    of Kurdish artists and journalists; viewers will be invited to  take  a
    journal with them until at the end of the exhibition the pile  will  be
    gone. The words will have been disseminated, but there will be  nothing
    left to show for  it.     The  Appellant  therefore  follows  the  long
    tradition of art in the middle east  where  political  commentary,  for
    safety reasons, is often offered obliquely.

 9. The Appellant's work has not always been  subtle.  At  the  hearing  he
    explained  how  his  message  has  on  occasion   been   overt.   Where
    appropriate, he has taken measures to protect himself  and  his  family
    against the consequences of that. For  instance  in  his  2011  Cardiff
    exhibition direct references to Jalal Talabani were  omitted  from  the
    images that he posted of the exhibition on Facebook. Although he was in
    the UK at the time he was conscious that his family were still in  Iraq
    and he did not want to  cause  them  problems.  This  tension,  between
    wanting to express himself, but wanting to keep  out  of  trouble,  has
    always been present in the Appellant's career.

10. The exhibition at the heart of this claim did  not  start  life  as  an
    installation to be seen  in  Liverpool.  The  original  idea  was  very
    different, and based on the chosen location of the piece.  There  is  a
    building in Sulaymaniyah  which  was,  in  Saddam  Hussain's  time,  an
    interrogation centre, and the rooms in  the  basement  were  previously
    cells where political detainees were held and tortured:  that  building
    is now a museum/art gallery called the  Amna  Souraka.  Photographs  of
    this building, and the Appellant preparing for his exhibition,  can  be
    found in the Respondent's bundle. The walls of the interrogation  cells
    were adorned with graffiti by their inmates.  The  Appellant's  concept
    was to use this space to reflect the ongoing  'imprisonment'  of  Iraqi
    Kurds with a reference to the lack of freedom of expression in the IKR.
    He wanted to take the words of three Kurdish journalists who  had  been
    murdered  -  Sardasht Osman, Kawa Garmiyani and Sorani Mama Hama -  and
    write them out in the style of the detainees' graffiti. This would then
    be projected onto the cell walls. As well as highlighting  the  murders
    of the men, the piece would raise questions about whether  Iraqi  Kurds
    are now actually free, and on  the  continuity  of  oppression  between
    Saddam's time and today.  The location is  particularly  evocative  not
    just because it was formerly a prison, but because the museum  and  art
    it houses today reflects the Kurdish struggle for freedom.

11. As a conceptual artist the Appellant spends a  considerable  amount  of
    time thinking about an  idea,  but  possibly  not  very  long  actually
    implementing  it.    At  the  time  that  he  was  preparing  for   the
    Sulaymaniyah exhibition he approached some  friends  of  his  who  were
    employed at the gallery, and they agreed  to  stage  his  installation.
    Then, approximately two weeks before it was due to open they  told  him
    that  he  needed  to  seek   formal   permission   from   the   gallery
    owner/manager, which the Appellant did.  The Appellant  explained  that
    this man knew that he intended to put on a show there, but not, at that
    stage its content. He had no  reason  to  be  concerned,  however:  the
    Appellant believes that his  position  at  the  university  would  have
    reassured  the  man  that   there   would   be   nothing   particularly
    controversial in the work.

12. In the run up to the exhibition opening,  friends  of  the  Appellant's
    dropped by to see the preparations.  Once they realised the  nature  of
    the content some of them began, "in a perfectly  friendly  and  helpful
    way"  to  raise  concerns.  They  suggested  that  before  opening  the
    Appellant had better speak to the manager. As a  result  the  Appellant
    paid the manager a visit the day before the exhibition was scheduled to
    open. He struck the Appellant as someone who understood  art,  and  who
    had sympathy for what the Appellant was trying to do.  He made it clear
    however that the work  could  cause  him  problems.  Whilst  a  general
    commentary on freedom of expression might be OK this could  put  his  -
    and the Appellant's - reputation, and safety, at risk.  He  asked  that
    the Appellant change his exhibition; the Appellant refused; the manager
    then suggested that he cancel  this  exhibition  and  work  on  a  less
    controversial one. The Appellant felt  that  the  manager's  next  move
    would have been to prohibit the gallery from proceeding with the  show.
    He therefore felt that he had no option but to cancel it himself.

13. The Appellant considered his options. Keen to stage the  exhibition  he
    made contact with various  venues  including  in  the  USA,  Italy  and
    Germany. Not achieving success in getting to any of  these  places,  he
    settled on coming back to the UK.

14. The installation was modified from its originally  intended  form  when
    opened in Liverpool on the 28th March 2018. As the Appellant explained,
    this was because much of the message was to be found in  the  location,
    and if it was not to be seen in the Amna Souraka then it  would  change
    the meaning. The basic premise was however the same. The words  of  the
    journalists were written on the walls  of  the  gallery.  Some  of  the
    articles that the words were taken  from  appear  in  the  Respondent's
    bundle. One speaks of death threats received by the writer; another  is
    sarcastically entitled "I am love with Barazani's daughter" and  speaks
    mockingly of all the benefits the writer might enjoy if he married into
    that family,  including  trips  to  Paris  and  Israeli  guards.    The
    exhibition was entitled 'Double Take' and photographs of the  work  are
    in the bundle.  It was seen by 10-15 people on each of  the  first  two
    days of opening.

15. The Appellant received the first  threatening  telephone  call  on  the
    evening of the 29th March. A voice asked him to confirm  his  identity,
    and that proceeded to inform him that the material  in  the  exhibition
    relating to Mahmoud Sangawi, and featured on Facebook, must be removed.
    The Appellant demanded  to  know  who  the  caller  was,  and  on  what
    authority he was telling  him  to  change  his  exhibition.  The  voice
    persisted. He said that it did not matter who  he  was,  and  that  the
    Appellant should also take the words  of  Kawa  Garmiyani  out  of  the
    piece.  For context, it  should  be  explained  that  Mahmoud  Sangawi,
    described by the Appellant as the head of the PUK peshmerga, is  widely
    believed to  have  been  behind  the  murder  of  the  journalist  Kawa
    Garmiyani. It was the caller's specific reference to these two  figures
    which led the Appellant to believe that  the  caller  was  working  for
    Sangawi (at his interview the Appellant also names two other  prominent
    Kurdish security officials whom he is particularly afraid of, but  does
    not elaborate why: the head of PUK  intelligence,  Lahor  Sheikh  Jangi
    and Masrour Barzani who is in charge  of  KDP  intelligence  security).
    The Appellant tried to explain to the caller that  the  words  he  used
    were not his, and that he was simply replicating them in his piece. The
    caller ended the conversation  with  this:  "I  am  not  going  to  say
    anything further, this is my last word to you".


16. The number that the call had come from was logged  on  the  Appellant's
    phone.  He decided to text to ask who he was. The caller  replied  that
    his name was Rahman, confirmed that he did indeed work for Sangawi  and
    then made the most explicit threat yet:

         "Listen to me well and do not be foolish. My name is Rahman  and  I
         am with Mr Mahmoud. If you do not do what I told you, I  will  kill
         you as Kawa Garmiyani was killed. Do not think that  I  don't  know
         your place; even I can send people over there"


         (missed call)


         "You were lucky yesterday. The place of the exhibition  was  closed
         otherwise you would have been stabbed there but just to  make  sure
         that you cannot get away...."


    (I have taken these text  from  the  translation  of  the  screen  shot
    itself, rather than the Appellant's summary of then at his interview).


17. After this, the Appellant explains, he became afraid. He was  reluctant
    to return to the gallery in Liverpool because he was concerned that  it
    might be being watched. He called the  Merseyside  police  to  ask  for
    advice and they told him to check that the gallery  had  CCTV  cameras,
    and that he should call 999 if he became concerned for his safety.


18. The next thing that happened was towards the end  of  April  2018.  The
    Appellant was in London and he received a call from his  mother,  using
    the 'viber' app and her daughter's telephone. His mother told him  that
    a few days earlier she had received a visit from three  men.  She  said
    "they had a car similar to ours, the one that brother Ali  bought  you,
    it was a Nissan patrol". Two of these men came to the  door  and  asked
    for the Appellant. The Appellant's mother wanted to know why they  were
    asking: they told her they wanted to talk to him about something.   She
    described the men as wearing traditional dress and  that  one  of  them
    carried a gun.  She told them that the Appellant was abroad and she did
    not know when he would be back. The Appellant reassured his mother that
    they were friends of his because he did not want her to worry.

19. A second visit to the family home is said to have taken place in  early
    2019. The Appellant's brother 'A' was at home when a group of men  came
    looking for the Appellant.  They  were  threatening  and  abusive.  'A'
    subsequently went to the police to make a report  but  as  far  as  the
    Appellant is aware nothing  has  happened.  The  police  will  not  now
    provide 'A' with confirmation that he made a complaint.   The Appellant
    strongly believes that these men must be working with the  authorities:
    "there is simply nobody else who would be seeking me  out  in  the  way
    that these people are". Observing that there was no attempt to  conceal
    their  intent,  the  Appellant  describes   this   visit   as   "hugely
    threatening".

20. The Appellant's brother has provided a signed handwritten statement  in
    Arabic confirming that this event took place. It,  and  a  translation,
    are in the bundle, accompanied by a copy of his CSID.     The event  is
    said by 'A' to have taken place on the 17th January 2019,  although  it
    was not apparently communicated to the Appellant until  into  February.
    'A' writes that after answering a knock at the door he was shoved  with
    force back into the house by two very aggressive men  who  demanded  to
    see his identity card. When he established that they were  looking  for
    the Appellant he told them that he is still in the UK. The men told him
    to tell the Appellant to come home straight away.

21. The final matter which caused the Appellant to fear for his safety  was
    the way that communications developed with a journalist working  for  a
    KDP-owned broadcaster in the IKR  (in  the  interview  the  station  is
    referred to as '24': the Appellant has subsequently amended this record
    as he says it was someone from 'Rudaw' - he was confused  because  they
    are both run by the KDP). The reporter, a Ms Robinson, messaged him out
    of the blue on Facebook. Their exchange of messages  is  still  on  the
    Appellant's Facebook page.  The relevant section has been  printed  and
    produced in evidence.   The reporter begins by asking him about his art
    and said that it caught her attention. She asks  if  he  will  be  home
    soon. He replies that he will be home on the 2nd April but  points  out
    that Rudaw does not cover his artwork as it is critical of the PUK/KDP.
    She replies "isn't it always good to challenge the  norm?"  .  Messages
    that follow show the reporter to be asking the Appellant to meet her in
    Sulaymaniyah or Erbil; she asks him when he is arriving  and  where  he
    will be staying and whether he intends to stage any more exhibitions in
    Iraq.  After the Appellant appears to have stopped replying  she  sends
    two further messages to ask him when he will be back.


22. Asked to explain how he thinks that his work might  have  come  to  the
    attention of PUK security officials the Appellant  had  several  ideas.
    His intention to stage the exhibition at  the  Amna  Souraka  had  been
    known to quite a number of staff members, some of whom were  linked  to
    the PUK; a cameraman who had worked on the projections and  several  of
    the  Appellant's  friends  were  aware  of  it;  the  events  in   both
    Sulaymaniyah and Liverpool had both been publicised  on  Facebook,  and
    the Appellant's telephone number also appeared there.    The  event  in
    Liverpool had been advertised locally and there was a sign outside  the
    gallery.

23. Asked why he has not encountered problems before the  Appellant  states
    that his honest answer is he does not know. Although he has  previously
    taken precautions  (as in editing the footage of his Cardiff exhibition
    for Facebook) he had not thought that he was seriously at risk. However
    he now sees the threats made against him, and  associated  events,   as
    being consistent with a tightening  of  restrictions  upon  freedom  of
    expression since 2018.

24. In respect of matters potentially  relevant  to  internal  flight,  the
    Appellant has never been  to  Baghdad,  save  to  transit  through  the
    airport. He knows no one in the city.   He claims to be able  to  speak
    basic Arabic.  He is nominally Sunni but at  the  hearing  acknowledged
    that he "does not really believe in it".  The Appellant told me that he
    has no close friends or family outside of the IKR, save his brother who
    lives in Liverpool.




    Country Background Information


25. The parties invited me to read the Country Policy and Information  Note
    Iraq: Political Opinion in the Kurdistan Region of  Iraq  dated  August
    2017. I have done so, mindful of two matters.


26. First,  that the plausibility of this account was not placed  in  issue
    in the Respondent's reasons for refusal letter of the 31st August 2018,
    and neither the HOPO who appeared in the First-tier  Tribunal,  nor  Mr
    Tan who appeared before me, argued the case on the basis  that  it  was
    inconsistent with  the  country  background  material.  It  is  further
    expressly accepted that the three journalists  who  have  inspired  the
    Appellant's art were murdered. For that reason Mr Sadiq had not, in his
    preparations, considered it  necessary  to  produce  extensive  country
    reports. The parties both proceeded on  the  basis  that  the  CPIN  is
    generally supportive of the notion that someone who publicly criticises
    the political elite of the IKR (viz the Talabani and Barzani clans  and
    their associates) could face persecution as a result.

27. The second preliminary point to be made is that in the  hiatus  between
    the hearing and the  decision  being  written,  a  new  CPIN  has  been
    published - Iraq: Opposition to the government in the Kurdistan  Region
    of Iraq (KRI) (June 2021).  I have  also  had  regard  to  this  latest
    information. Had the new CPIN contained anything markedly  inconsistent
    with the material in the 2017 version, agreed by the parties to  be  an
    accurate reflection of the position in the IKR,  I would have  reverted
    to the parties and given them an opportunity to comment.  I did not  in
    the end find that to be necessary, given that the  Secretary  of  State
    has not disputed that there is repression against  perceived  political
    opponents in the media: the updated version is, in effect, more of  the
    same.

28. The 2017 CPIN summarises the Secretary of State's  policy  position  as
    follows:

         "In general, a person will not  be  at  risk  of  serious  harm  or
         persecution on the basis of  political  activity  within  the  KRI.
         Decision makers must, however, consider each  case  on  its  facts.
         Journalists/media workers and human rights defenders,  particularly
         independent journalists who do not have the  protection  of  either
         the KDP or the PUK, and those who  write  about  certain  subjects,
         including corruption, the lack  of  human  rights  in  the  region,
         women's rights and anything that could be construed as  endangering
         the security of the region or public morality, and  those  critical
         (or perceived to be critical) of prominent figures in  the  KDP  or
         associated organs such as the peshmerga are more likely  to  be  at
         risk of mistreatment which may amount to persecution".


29. The 2017 CPIN goes on to cite evidence that journalists  are  "arrested
    on a regular basis" [10.1.1] and face imprisonment with impunity. Those
    most often targeted are those who expose  corruption,  and  journalists
    who have specifically mentioned the family of  the  President  in  such
    articles have "lost their lives" [10.4.2].


30. These themes continue in the 2021 CPIN which  details  how  journalists
    covering protests in 2020 have been accused by the government of  being
    foreign spies [2.4.5], independent media outlets have been closed  down
    and harassed [2.4.6]  and  their  journalists  subject  to  arrest  and
    prosecution [11.2]. The CPIN further highlights the use of a new method
    to suppress freedom of speech: the Law of Misuse of Electronic Devices,
    aimed at shutting down online dissent. See for instance at [11.2.10]:

         "KRG officials increased their use of lawsuits against  journalists
         critical of the KRG, including applying laws such  as  the  Law  of
         Misuse of Electronic Devices instead of the IKR press law.  In  the
         first  nine  months  of  the  year,  KRG  officials  from   various
         government  offices  filed  eight  independent   lawsuits   against
         freelance  journalist  Hemn  Mamand  after  he  posted  content  on
         Facebook critical  of  the  KRG's  COVID-19  response.  Mamand  was
         arrested twice, in March and again in April, and spent 34  days  in
         detention on charges levied under the Law of Misuse  of  Electronic
         Devices."

31. The consequences of arrest for Mr Mamand, and generally for  those  who
    have  criticised  the  authorities  is  explained  under  the   heading
    'Detention Conditions' at [11.4]:


         11.4.1 The October 2020 report published by EMHRM looked at  prison
         conditions and stated: '...Euro-Med  Monitor's  team  met  Muhammad
         Maruf Nuri, the director of the anti-torture programme at the  Arab
         World Center for Democratic Development. He stated:


           "Having observed detention centers, we found that detainees  are
           kept in places that  lack  the  basic  life  requirements.  Most
           detention centers keep  detainees  in  rooms  or  warehouses  --
           places that don't have  the  basic  life  requirements  such  as
           sunshine, heating, light, or bathrooms. In  addition,  in  these
           centres, detainees are not provided with  meals;  instead,  they
           have to  buy  food  themselves  although  they  are  poor.  This
           reflects the catastrophic situation in detention centers"


         Euro-Med Monitor's team met a group of detainees, who revealed  the
         worsening situation inside these centers  and  how  they  lack  the
         basic precautionary measures to prevent the spread of COVID19.


         In an interview with,  Hayman  Mamend  Had,  a  journalist  and  an
         activist, said:


           "I was arrested twice during the COVID19  pandemic  crisis.  The
           first time was on March 10 2020, at 10:30 pm. About 20  security
           vehicles and 100 security personnel stormed my house  to  arrest
           me for criticizing the authorities' performance in fighting  the
           COVID19 pandemic. They used the pandemic as an excuse to  impose
           restrictions on political activists amid the absence  of  proper
           handling of the economic situation.


           I was detained at several security centers [for short periods of
           time] before I arrived at Al-Mahatta Central Prison on the Mosul
           Road in  Erbil.  During  the  deportation  period,  despite  the
           COVID19 outbreak, there was no respect for health standards such
           as wearing masks, using sanitizers , social distancing where  we
           were moved in an overcrowded vehicle.  When  I  arrived,  I  was
           placed in a room measuring  about  5x10  meters  with  50  other
           prisoner convicted of serious felonies  such  as  murder,  rape,
           and, abuse.  ...Throughout  my  detention,  I  was  deprived  of
           exposure to sunlight, causing me skin health  problems  which  I
           still suffer from until now. Being a political prisoner,  I  was
           deprived of contacting my family unlike other prisoners.


           On April 5 2020 I was released on bail. The next day  at  1  am,
           however, security forces stormed my house and  arrested  me  for
           the second time in front my mother. Once again, I  was  detained
           in several detention centers then  moved  to  Al-Mahatta  prison
           with the same  conditions  I  suffered  from  during  the  first
           arrest, despite  the  spread  of  the  pandemic.  I  was  denied
           contacting my family or being exposed to sunlight. On  28  April
           2020 I was released on bail. In both times, I paid an amount  of
           30 million dinars (25,000$  US).  My  bail  bondsmen  are  daily
           subjected to harassment. Being threatened and  arrested  several
           times, in May, 2020, I left my city and went to Sulaymaniyah".


32. The only other materials to which I was referred in submissions was the
    2018 US State Department Report and a  series  of  articles.  The  USSD
    report adds little to the CPIN save that I note  that  it  confirms  as
    accurate the Appellant's description of '24' and 'Rudaw' as  being  KDP
    mouthpieces.  The articles in the  Appellant's  bundle  deal  with  the
    murders of the aforementioned journalists. I note from  these  articles
    that other media figures have also  been  targeted  for  assassination,
    such as Shaswar Abdulwahid, the owner of  a  non-affiliated  television
    station, and Dr Abdul Al-Sattar Tahir  Sharif,  an  academic  allegedly
    killed for his critique of the government's failings over Kirkuk.   The
    articles further confirm that that despite Mahmoud Sangawi being widely
    believed to be responsible for the killing at least of Kawa  Garmayani,
    he was cleared of all charges in 2015.  The prosecution had been  based
    on  the  police  recovery  of  threatening  voicemails  left   on   the
    journalist's mobile phone.




      Evaluation

33. Having had the opportunity to hear the Appellant give his evidence I am
    wholly satisfied that he is a credible witness  and  that  his  factual
    assertions about events in the recent  past  are  evidence  capable  of
    discharging the burden of proof to the lower  standard.   I  make  that
    finding because:


              i) The Appellant's testimony was internally consistent (ie  no
                 significant contradictions between  the  oral  and  written
                 accounts,  no  material  discrepancies  revealed  in  cross
                 examination);


             ii) His account  is  consistent  with  the  country  background
                 evidence. The country background material does not, perhaps
                 unsurprisingly, have  anything  to  say  about  artists  in
                 particular.  There  are  however  numerous  references   to
                 freedom  of  speech  issues  in  Iraqi  Kurdistan  and   of
                 journalists  in  particular  facing   arrest,   harassment,
                 assault or even death.  I am satisfied that the risk to the
                 Appellant can properly  be  evaluated  in  light  of  those
                 uncontested reports;


            iii) The evidence about the political motivation underlying  the
                 Appellant's art was cogent  and  compelling.  I  found  his
                 description of his conceptual work to  be  consistent  with
                 genuinely held anger towards the  political  elite  in  the
                 IKR. The Appellant feels strongly that  journalists  should
                 be  able  to  report  fearlessly   on   matters   including
                 governmental  corruption.  He  believes  that  it  was  the
                 willingness of the three journalists who  featured  in  his
                 piece to speak out against the authorities in the IKR which
                 led to their murder. Whether or not the  Appellant  himself
                 characterises these views as 'political',  I  am  satisfied
                 that the threats he has received, and  the  suppression  of
                 his work that has occurred  so  far,  are  because  of  his
                 political opinion;

             iv) The Appellant's account  further  contained  details  which
                 give the strong impression that this is recounting,  rather
                 than invention. See for instance the  Appellant's  mother's
                 mention that the unknown visitors "had  a  car  similar  to
                 ours, the one that brother Ali bought you, it was a  Nissan
                 patrol";

              v) The account is supported by documentary evidence  including
                 the written  statement  of  the  Appellant's  brother,  the
                 Facebook printouts, the threatening text messages  and  the
                 photographs.

34. I further note, although this played only  a  very  small  part  in  my
    deliberations, that the Appellant  was  employed  by  the  Ministry  of
    Higher Education as a Lecturer at the University of  Sulaymaniyah  when
    he left Iraq. He was offered financial sponsorship to travel to the  UK
    in order to complete a PhD in the UK, an offer he turned down  to  take
    up this teaching position. He had a return ticket and  is  someone  who
    has travelled extensively in and out of Iraq in the past.   As such  he
    does not have the typical profile of an "economic migrant"  or  someone
    who has the motivation to falsify a protection claim.  In  making  that
    finding I have taken into account that the Appellant has  also  in  the
    past been refused visas for the UK,  and  that  his  persistence  would
    appear to indicate a desire to travel here, but I  have  balanced  that
    against the fact that he decided to take the job in  Iraq  rather  than
    remain here on a path to settlement, as he no doubt could have done had
    he extended his Tier 4 visa by accepting the PhD offer.


35. I am accordingly satisfied, on the lower standard, that  the  Appellant
    is telling the truth. Indeed much  of  the  account  has  already  been
    accepted by the Respondent. The question is whether the Appellant faces
    a real risk of harm should he return to Iraq.

36. It has been over two years since any direct threats have been  made  to
    the Appellant, either by 'Rahman' or by  visits  to  his  family  home.
    Both of those events were, nonetheless, explicitly threatening  to  the
    Appellant. The messages of Rahman make clear that it is his art  -  and
    the political opposition it expresses - that is considered  to  be  the
    problem. The visits by armed men to the family home make clear what the
    proposed solution to that problem is.   It  appears  from  the  country
    guidance material that there is  a  degree  of  freedom  of  expression
    permitted in  the  IKR,  but  that  there  is  a  line,  drawn  by  the
    authorities, or more accurately  senior  political  figures  acting  in
    their own self-interest, which should not be crossed.    The  Appellant
    had, until 2018, managed to  stay  on  the  right  side  of  the  line.
    'Double Take' crossed it.  Having had regard  to  the  content  of  the
    piece I do not think it unduly  speculative  to  say  that  it  did  so
    because it included text  which  openly  challenged  the  Barazani  and
    Talabani families in a provocative, and at times mocking way. The piece
    'I am in love with  Massoud  Barzani's  daughter'  by  murdered  writer
    Sardasht Osman gives a flavour:
         I am in love with the daughter of Massoud Barzani, the man who
         appears here and there and claims he is my president. I would like
         him to be my father-in-law and also I would like to be a brother-in-
         law with Nechirvan Barzani.

         If I become Massoud Barzani's son-in-law, we would spend our
         honeymoon in Paris and also we would visit our uncle's mansion in
         America. I would move my house from one of the poorest areas in
         Erbil to Sari Rash where it would be protected by American guard
         dogs and Israeli bodyguards.

         I would make my father become the Minister of Peshmerga. He had
         been Peshmerga in September revolution, but he now has no pension
         because he is no longer a member of Kurdistan Democratic Party.

         I would make my unlucky baby brother, who recently finished
         university but is now unemployed and looking to leave Kurdistan,
         chief of my special forces.

         My sister who has been too embarrassed to go to the bazaar to shop,
         could drive all the expensive cars just as Barzani's daughters
         do.

         For my mother, who is diabetic and has high blood pressure and
         heart problems but who is not able to afford treatment outside
         Kurdistan, I would hire a couple Italian doctors to treat her in
         the comfort of her own house.

         For my uncles, I would open few offices and departments and they,
         along with all my nieces and nephews would become high generals,
         officers, and commanders.
         All my friends said Saro, let it go and give it up for otherwise
         you will get yourself killed. The family of Mulla Mustafa Barzani
         can kill anyone they want, and they surely will.

         I told them I did not commit blasphemy and I swear to the dagger of
         Mustafa Idris Barzani that my father had spent 3 nights with him on
         the same mountain and so why not say those things? Massoud Barzani
         claimed himself that he is a president,      t    and I would ask
         him how may time has he visited Erbil and Sulaimaniyah in the last
         18 years?

         My problem is this man, Massoud Barzani, is so tribal that so
         arrogant that he does not recognize anybody from even the other
         side of Sari Rash. With a few clicks, I can out more about any
         leaders' wives in the world but I have no idea who my mother-in-law
         would be and what she looks like.

         I have no idea who I should take with me to ask Massoud Barzani to
         give me his blessing to marry his daughter. From the beginning, I
         thought I should take with me few religious figures, some
         respectful old men and some old Peshmerga, but one of my journalist
         friends told me that I should find some Saddam collaborators and
         those who participated in the Anfal operation with Saddam because
         they are all around Massoud now and he likes them. Another friend
         suggested that I should go to one of news conference of Nechirvan
         Barzani and make friends with him and ask him to do me a favor.
         However, if he doesn't help, then I can ask Dashne because she
         meets them frequently and might help out.


37. Osman here takes aim not only at corruption, and tribalism, but charges
    outright betrayal, highlighting the suffering of the  ordinary  people,
    and perhaps most painful  of  all,  that  the  Kurdish  leadership  are
    collaborating with  their  former  enemies  in  the  Ba'athist  regime.
    Shortly after his piece was first published Osman  started  to  receive
    threatening telephone calls.  He was then  abducted  from  outside  the
    College of Art in Erbil, where he was a student.  His body was found  a
    few days later in Mosul. He had been handcuffed and shot in  the  head.
     In choosing works like this as the centrepiece  of  his  installation,
    the Appellant has, it would seem, been marked out at  someone  who  has
    crossed the line.  I find it likely that the threats have stopped  more
    recently simply because the authorities  understand  that  he  has  not
    returned to Kurdistan. Having had  regard  to  the  country  background
    material I am satisfied that there would, if he returned to  Kurdistan,
    be a renewed interest in ensuring that he stays silent. This  leads  me
    to consider another aspect of this case: if the Appellant  does  choose
    to stay silent upon return, and thereby hope to  remain  on  the  right
    side of the line, does that infringe one of his core rights?


38. In HJ (Iran)(FC) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2010]
    the Supreme Court laid out  a  framework  for  consideration  of  where
    discretion on the part  of  the  individual  fitted  into  the  refugee
    protection framework.  At ï¿½82 of the judgment Lord Rodger  sets  out  a
    series of questions to be asked in respect of someone who claims a fear
    of persecution because of their sexual orientation.  Here I apply  that
    framework to this case, and a fear of persecution for political belief.

39. The first question is whether the Appellant does in fact hold political
    beliefs. The Secretary of  State  has  focused  on  the  fact  that  at
    interview the Appellant demurred from the suggestion  that  he  was  an
    'activist'.  Having had regard  to  the  evidence  before  me,  and  in
    particular the Appellant's detailed and cogent oral evidence, I have no
    hesitation in finding the Appellant's work to be political  in  nature,
    however he might  characterise  it  himself.    Some  pieces  are  more
    nuanced than others  -  the  deconstructed  slippers  speaking  to  the
    Kurdish diaspora - but the work that is at the centre  of  this  appeal
    is, as set out above, overtly critical of the authorities in the IKR.

40. The next question to be asked is whether someone who  openly  expressed
    political views like that in Kurdistan would be liable to  persecution.
    I accept the position taken in the 2017  CPIN  that  not  everyone  who
    expresses a contrary political view in Kurdistan faces persecution (see
    my ï¿½28  above).   The  Secretary  of  State  nevertheless  agrees  that
    independent voices who write  about  certain  subjects,  in  particular
    corruption or the lack of human rights in the region, are  more  likely
    to  face  serious  harm.   The  CPIN,  and  articles  provided  by  the
    Appellant, demonstrate that those serious harms include being  arrested
    on a "regular basis", being held in inhuman and  degrading  conditions,
    facing conviction and imprisonment under laws designed to suppress free
    speech, and  at  worst,  for  those  who  mention  the  family  of  the
    President, death.  I am accordingly satisfied  that  those  who  openly
    express such opinions in Iraqi Kurdistan do face persecution.

41. The next question  posed  by  Lord  Rodger  is  to  consider  what  the
    applicant would do if he returned to his country of origin. I  have  no
    doubt that the Appellant would continue to express himself through art,
    and that he cannot be expected to abandon that  career:   Secretary  of
    State v MSM (Somalia) [2016] EWCA Civ 715.  I  note  however  that  the
    Appellant has in the past modified his work, or the reporting of it, to
    'play it safe'. Examples of political expression that have  emerged  in
    the evidence before me include his belief that the  elites  represented
    by the KDP/PUK leadership  are  corrupt  failures  (Cardiff)  and  that
    journalists are  killed  in  Kurdistan  for  speaking  truth  to  power
    (Sulaymaniyah). In both of these instances  the  Appellant  has  either
    chosen to censor his own work, or the reporting  of  it,  in  order  to
    protect either himself or his family. In the former instance by editing
    images on Facebook, and in the latter by abandoning the  exhibition  in
    the Amna Souraka.  Having heard his evidence I am in little doubt  that
    the Appellant has been left extremely shaken  by  the  threats  he  has
    received, and he is genuinely afraid. In fact he  acknowledges  in  his
    witness statement that he  has  desisted  from  producing  any  further
    political work at present because he remains concerned for his  safety,
    and more importantly for that of his family remaining in  Sulaymaniyah.
    I therefore conclude that if the Appellant were to return to the IKR he
    would likely deliberately conceal his true political beliefs.


42. The final HJ question is why the Appellant would do so. As Lord  Rodger
    explains, it is no answer to a claim under the  Refugee  Convention  to
    expect the claimant to simply comply with the aims of the persecutor:

         To reject his application on the ground that  he  could  avoid  the
         persecution by living discreetly would be to defeat the very  right
         which the Convention exists to protect - his right to  live  freely
         and openly as a gay man without fear of persecution.  By  admitting
         him to asylum and allowing him to live freely and openly as  a  gay
         man without fear of persecution, the receiving state  gives  effect
         to that right by  affording  the  applicant  a  surrogate  for  the
         protection from persecution which his country of nationality should
         have afforded him.


43. I accept without reservation that if the Appellant felt able to  openly
    express his true political opinion he would do so. The only reason that
    he would censor his own work would be because he is  seeking  to  avoid
    persecution of the kind suffered by Sardasht Osman, Kawa Garmiyani  and
    Sorani Mama Hama.  It follows that  he  has  a  well  founded  fear  of
    persecution in Iraqi Kurdistan.


44. At the hearing I raised the matter  of  internal  flight.  The  refusal
    letter does address the question, but rather confusingly concludes that
    it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect  the  Appellant  to  relocate  to
    Sulaymaniyah, which is of course his home town. Beyond that the  letter
    simply asserts that the Appellant could live in Iraq. Mr Tan was unable
    to point to any particular location where the Secretary of State  might
    regard as reasonable for a person internally displaced from the IKR  by
    a threat of persecution, but simply adopted the stance in  the  refusal
    letter.

45. In view of my findings on the application of the HJ (Iran) principle  I
    do not find internal flight to be  a  reasonable  alternative  in  this
    case. 'Rahman' and his associates have already demonstrated an  adverse
    interest in the Appellant for work he has undertaken in  Liverpool.  In
    those circumstances I am satisfied that the Appellant would continue to
    face the same risk wherever he lived in Iraq: he would continue to edit
    his own work for fear of persecution wherever he is  in  that  country.
    Even if that were not the case, it is on the  evidence  before  me  not
    reasonable to expect this nominally Sunni Kurd to relocate to Arab, GOI
    controlled Iraq. He knows no one outside of the IKR, and has never been
    to  Iraq  proper  save  to  transit  in  Baghdad  airport.  He  has  no
    connections there to call upon and although he claims to speak  'basic'
    Arabic it is difficult to see how he could safely establish himself and
    obtain employment etc: see headnote 19 of    SMO,  KSP  &  IM  (Article
    15(c); identity documents) Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 00400 (IAC).



    Anonymity Order

46. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:




         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
