For the appellant:     Mr Z Malik, Mamoon Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr S. Walker, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

   1. The first appellant is a national of Pakistan. He applied for
      indefinite leave to remain on the basis of 10 years continuous lawful
      residence. He came to the United Kingdom on 10 November 2007 with
      entry clearance as a student and subsequently obtained various leaves
      in other capacities.

   2. His application was refused on the basis of discrepancies between his
      claimed earnings with the income declared to HMRC in some of those
      earlier applications. The respondent pointed out that paragraph 276 B
      (ii)(c) requires consideration of an applicant's character.

   3. On 1 April 2011 he had made a Tier 1 highly skilled migrant
      application and claimed 25 points in respect of historic earnings of
      �40,258. Of this, �23,358 was attributed to self-employment from 1
      August 2010 until 24 March 2011. In the similar application made on 18
      May 2013 he claimed 20 points. He claimed a historic income of
      �37,077.70 in respect of the period 1 May 2012 to 30 April 2013 of
      which �12,093 was from self-employment. However, the Inland Revenue
      confirmed that for the tax year 2010 to 2011 he declared income of
      only �8358 from self-employment and for the tax year 2012 to 2013 he
      only declared �5085.

   4. He was interviewed about this and completed a questionnaire in which
      he referred to having filed amended returns. He stated his current
      accountant spotted discrepancies which prompted the amended return. He
      claimed that the accountant who submitted the original returns acted
      dishonestly.

   5. The respondent did not find his explanations credible and refused his
      application on the basis he did not meet paragraph 276 B. He was
      refused under the general grounds in paragraph 322(5).

   6. The second appellant is also a national of Pakistan and is married to
      the first named appellant. She came to the United Kingdom as his
      dependent on 20 January 2015. Her application for leave to remain on
      the basis of human rights was refused in line with her husband's. They
      have a three-year-old daughter who is with them and who holds
      Pakistani nationality. A second child was since born to them.

The First tier Tribunal

   7. Their appeals were heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Bannerman at
      Manchester on 9 May 2019. In a decision promulgated on 20 September
      2019 they were dismissed. The judge set out the refusal and the
      arguments advanced at hearing and recorded the appellant's evidence.
      At paragraph 49 under the heading `Standard and Burden of Proof' the
      judge stated:

         The burden of proof is on the appellant and the standard of proof
         is on the balance of probabilities.


   8. At paragraph 55 the judge stated the respondent had considered the
      evidence pointing in each direction and concluded the respondent was
      justified to conclude that the appellant had acted dishonestly.

   9. At paragraph 58 the judge commented that the appellant age in
      connection with this country was positive but his character and
      conduct was not. The judge described his domestic circumstances as
      straightforward, being married with two young children. The judge said
      there were compassionate factors regarding his children and the work
      he had been doing in the National Health Service. The judge referred
      to the section 55 duty and also had regard to paragraph 276 ADE.
      However, the judge concluded that the consequences would not be
      unjustifiably harsh if the family returned to Pakistan.
The Upper Tribunal

  10.  Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on the basis
      it was arguable the judge erred in stating the burden of proof was on
      the first appellant. It was also arguable that the judge may have
      failed to have applied the decision of Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673.

  11. In Balajigari the court said that paragraph 322(5) of the rules
      involved a two-stage analysis. Firstly, it was necessary to decide
      whether it was undesirable to grant leave in the light of the matters
      raise. There must be reliable evidence of sufficiently reprehensible
      conduct and an assessment, taking proper account of all relevant
      circumstances, as to whether the person's presence was undesirable.
      The court said that an earnings discrepancies case could constitute
      sufficiently reprehensible conduct only if the discrepancy was the
      result of the individuals dishonesty. Errors caused by carelessness,
      ignorance or poor advice did not meet the necessary threshold.
      Dishonest conduct would not always reach a sufficient level of
      seriousness to justify the application of paragraph 322(5), albeit the
      court said it was hard to see how the deliberate and dishonest
      submission of false earnings figures would not do so.

  12. The second stage was to decide, as a matter of discretion, whether
      leave should be refused because of such undesirability. It was
      necessary to consider, notwithstanding the undesirability of the
      individual having leave to remain, if there were factors outweighing
      this presumption. The court said there would exceptionally be cases
      where the interests of children or others or serious problems about
      removal meant it would be wrong to refuse leave to remain, albeit not
      necessarily indefinite leave to remain.

  13. The Court of Appeal endorsed the guidance given at paragraph 37 of R (
      on the application of Khan)-v- SSHD ( dishonesty, tax return,
      paragraph 322(5))[2018] UKUT 384 except for one qualification. In that
      case Spencer J stated that where there was a significant discrepancy
      between the incomes declared an inference can be drawn that the
      applicant had been deceitful or dishonest. The more recent decision
      warned that there was a danger that this starting point misstated the
      position. Whilst the discrepancy between earnings declared to the
      respondent and to the Revenue might justifiably give rise to a
      suspicion of dishonesty it did not, by itself, justify such a
      conclusion. Rather, it simply called for an explanation. There was no
      legal burden on the applicant to disprove dishonesty. The Secretary of
      State needed to decide, considering the discrepancy in light of the
      explanation, whether the applicant had been dishonest. The Secretary
      of State must be satisfied that the dishonesty had occurred, the
      standard of proof being the balance of probabilities and bearing in
      mind the serious consequences from such a finding.

  14. At the outset of the hearing before me Mr Malik and Mr Walker
      indicated there was consensus in that the judge had made no reference
      in the decision to Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673and the guidance
      given. Mr Malik pointed out that the decision had been raised before
      the judge and a copy of the decision was provided. The Court of Appeal
      decision was promulgated on 16 April 2019 and is referred to in the
      written submissions that were before the judge. This was an important
      decision giving guidance on the approach to such cases. Both parties
      have submitted that a failure by the judge to refer to this decision
      or indicate those factors were taken into account amounts to a
      material error of law. I would agree with this.

  15. The other point advanced by Mr Malik was that the judge erred in law
      by the comments about the burden of proof at paragraph 49. I do not
      find this point so clear. There is a danger in focusing upon a single
      comment in a decision. I made the point to Mr Malik that the appeal,
      albeit through the prism of the rules was concerned with the
      appellant's article 8 rights. In that context it was for the appellant
      to establish the existence of such a right. Mr Malik in response said
      it was for the respondent to justify the interference.

  16. The written submissions in the First-tier Tribunal stated that with
      the respondent has made allegation of dishonesty and it was for the
      respondent to demonstrate this. I would agree with that statement in
      context. As the Court of Appeal said there must be reliable evidence
      of sufficiently reprehensible conduct. However it is not so clear if
      the judge was simply making a general statement. However, for
      practical purposes it is not necessary to labour the point because
      both parties are in agreement there is a material error of law in
      relation to a failure to reflect the decision of Balajigari in the
      determination.

  17. Both representatives were in agreement that given the factual
      assessment required it was more appropriate to remit the appeal for a
      de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bannerman materially errs in law
and is set aside. The appeals are remitted for a de novo hearing in the
First-tier Tribunal
