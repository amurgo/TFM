                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Miller, promulgated on 13th March 2017, following  a  hearing  at
    Taylor House on 17th February 2017.  In the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Bangladesh, who was born on  24th
    December 1984.  He appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 27th August  2014,  refusing  his  application
    made on 10th July 2014 for leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that, having been granted leave to remain as a
    Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant until 28th July 2014, after  he  had  first
    entered as a student in 2009, he now had access to at least �50,000  to
    invest in a business.  He had provided a NatWest business account  bank
    statement as evidence of this.  He also had a legal  agreement  between
    himself and his company.  He was able to satisfy  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41SD(c)(ii)(4) and paragraph 46SD(a)(iii) of Appendix A.  The
    Respondent in her decision of 27th August 2014 decided  that  this  was
    not the case.

The Judge's Findings

 4. On 17th February 2017, this appeal came up before  Judge  Miller  as  a
    "float case".  The judge set out the basic elements of the  Appellant's
    claim (at paragraphs 4 to 5), and noted how the Respondent Secretary of
    State had rejected the claim made  by  the  Appellant  on  all  fronts.
    There was a bundle of 130 pages before the  judge  (see  paragraph  8).
    The judge referred to the oral evidence, and noted that  the  Appellant
    stated in his evidence that when he had applied he  had  money  in  his
    business account, which was transferred into his personal account  (see
    page E1).  It was noted that the company  account  was  at  D3  of  the
    bundle.  The personal account was at E1 (see paragraph 12).  In  cross-
    examination the Appellant was asked how he had transferred �20,000  and
    he had said that he had transferred �20,000 and then �19,990  into  his
    personal account (see E1), because, "when my solicitor found  out  that
    the company should be in  the  personal  account,  he  told  me  and  I
    transferred it" (see paragraph 13).  The judge  noted  that  the  legal
    agreement between the Appellant and his company, Continental Properties
    Global Limited, was documented at pages 107 to 108 (see paragraph  14).
    The conclusion of the judge was that it was clear  that  the  Appellant
    had failed to meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  "as  set
    out in the refusal notice" (paragraph 15).  The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that the determination of the judge is
    very short (less than three  pages  including  the  headings)  and  the
    Tribunal's assessment and conclusions in  respect  of  the  Appellant's
    appeal are contained only in a single paragraph at paragraph 15 and  do
    not explain how  it  is  that  the  Appellant  failed  to  satisfy  the
    requirements in the Rules.

 6. On 30th October 2017 permission to appeal  was  granted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  It was said that the judge did  not  set  out  the  relevant
    Rules.  The judge did not set out the material submitted  in  purported
    fulfilment of the requirements.  The judge did  not  set  out  why  the
    material submitted fell short of the requirements.  It was said that an
    ordinary reader trying to make sense of  the  determination  could  not
    reasonably derive any benefit from the two sentences at  paragraphs  12
    and 13 save to infer that money was in the wrong  account.   Permission
    to appeal was granted on this basis.

 7. On 16th November 2017 a Rule 24 response was entered to the effect that
    the case of Ahmed and Another (PBS: admissible  evidence)  [2014]  UKUT
    00365 stood for the proposition that the proper date for  determination
    of an application is the date of the application itself.  At  the  date
    of the application all the documents had not been submitted.

The Hearing

 8. At the hearing before me on 2nd January 2018, Mr  Biggs,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, submitted that the gravamen of the application
    was not that the judge had failed to set out the Immigration Rules  but
    that, following the House of Lords judgment in South Bucks DC v  Porter
    [2004] UKHL 33 at paragraph 36, it was not possible for  the  Appellant
    to know why it was that his case had not been made out.

 9. Mr Biggs drew my attention to  pages  3  to  5  of  the  bundle,  which
    contained  the  Appellant's  witness  statement,  where  he  states  at
    paragraph 3 (second sentence) that all the documents had been  provided
    as required by the Secretary of State, such  that  it  was  simply  not
    correct for the Secretary of  State  to  maintain  that  the  specified
    evidence had not been submitted.  At paragraph 6 the  Appellant  states
    that he had already invested the money.  The shortfall, he  maintained,
    could be made up by the fact that the  money  had  been  invested.   At
    pages 106 to 107  (which  the  judge  had  alluded  to  in  passing  at
    paragraph 14  of  the  determination)  there  was  a  letter  from  the
    Appellant's accountant, and this  was  sent  before  the  date  of  the
    decision, which explains how the investment has come about.   Moreover,
    at pages 107 to 108 there is a formal written agreement confirming  the
    director's loan which meets the requirements of paragraph 46SD.

10. Furthermore, if one looks even at the Respondent's bundle (at  E1)  one
    can see a personal bank account with �47,000 in it, which came  out  of
    the business account of the Appellant into his personal account, as  he
    was advised to do.  Also in the Respondent's own documentation there is
    at D1 to D4 the business bank account showing the  investment.   At  D1
    onwards there is a personal account of the Appellant showing the  money
    which was originally in the business account of the Appellant.  At page
    103 one has the unaudited account from the accountant.

11. Mr Biggs submitted that when all of this  is  cumulatively  taken  into
    account, it was clear that the Appellant satisfied the  terms  both  of
    paragraph 41SD and paragraph 46SD.  The judge's failure to engage  with
    this evidence, and simply to adopt  the  reasoning  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State, was an error of law, and did not demonstrate to the
    Appellant why it was that he lost his appeal.

12. For his part, Mr Tufan submitted that he would rely upon  his  Rule  24
    response, and the reference there made to the case of Ahmed [2014] UKUT
    00365, which was authority for the proposition that  the  date  of  the
    application is the relevant time to consider the documentation.  It  is
    true that at D1 there is reference to �41,000, but this  document  came
    in after the application.  Indeed the  grounds  of  application  accept
    that all the relevant information was not all  sent  out  at  the  same
    time.

13. In reply, Mr Biggs submitted that if one looks at paragraph  5  of  the
    determination in Ahmed [2014] UKUT 365, it is stated that, in  relation
    to Section 85A, that "the purpose of that provision is quite clear.  It
    is that where a points-based  application  is  made  and  refused,  the
    assessment by the judge is to be of the material that  was  before  the
    decision-maker rather than a new consideration of  new  material".   He
    argued that the material was before the decision-maker at the  time  of
    his  decision.   Second,  he  was  not  relying  upon  the  "evidential
    flexibility Rule" because all of the relevant documents  were  actually
    submitted in time for  the  decision-maker's  decision.   Some  of  the
    documents, such as at E1, were  actually  in  the  Respondent's  bundle
    already.

14. Both sides agreed that, if I were to make a finding of an error of law,
    the appropriate course of action was to remit this matter back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal, because of the complex nature  of  the  provisions
    here.  These involved the precise manner in which the Rules  should  be
    interpreted.  They also involved a consideration of what  material  was
    before the decision-maker, if all the relevant  documentation  had  not
    all been sent out at the same time in the "application".  This required
    careful argumentative analysis before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, so
    that if there was to be an error in the decision, the  aggrieved  party
    could preserve their right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  thereafter.
    As for this matter not having arisen before, Mr  Biggs  made  it  clear
    that his original Grounds of Appeal were preserved at E27, where it  is
    argued that there was insufficient reasoning provided by the  judge  in
    this case.  Both sides also agreed  that  this  matter  should  not  be
    entered into the list of the First-tier Tribunal on  a  remittal  as  a
    "float case" the next time around.

Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  re-make  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

16. It is plain that, whilst the judge sets out the  alternative  arguments
    put forward by the Appellant at paragraphs 4 to 5 of the determination,
    there is no engagement with the evidence, particularly given  that  the
    conclusions reached in the refusal letter were patently not open to the
    decision-maker to reach.  The  Appellant  had  invested  the  money  he
    claimed to have invested.  There was evidence even in the  Respondent's
    bundle at E1 and D1 to D3.  There was an agreement between himself  and
    the company.

17. In these circumstances, the application of paragraph 41SD and paragraph
    46SD required a proper and fuller analysis.  The statement that,  "with
    regard  to  the  legal  agreement  between  himself  and  his  company,
    Continental Properties Global Limited, reference was made to page  107-
    108" (at paragraph 14) does not  demonstrate  an  engagement  with  the
    evidence and clear findings of fact made on that evidence.   There  is,
    in short, insufficient reasoning.





Notice of Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I re-make the decision as follows.  This appeal is
    to be allowed to the extent that it is remitted back to the  First-tier
    Tribunal under Practice Statement 7.2(a), to be heard by a judge  other
    than Judge Miller.  This appeal should not be set down as a float case.
     This appeal is allowed.

19. No anonymity direction is made.
