For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Appellant, a national  of  India  born  on  30
    December 1987 against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  who,
    sitting at Hatton Cross on 30  October  2013  and  in  a  determination
    subsequently promulgated on 21 November 2013, dismissed the  appeal  of
    the Appellant against the decision of the  Respondent  dated  17  April
    2013 to refuse his combined application for  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under the  Points-
    Based System and for a Biometric Residence Permit.

2.   Permission to  appeal  that  decision  was  granted  in  light  of  the
    decision of the High Court in this case.

3.   The First-tier Judge in holding that the Appellant  failed  to  satisfy
    the requirements of the Rules failed to appreciate  that  the  relevant
    time for judging  whether  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  had  been
    complied with was the time of the decision  (see  Shabhaz  [2014]  EWHC
    2038 (Admin)).

4.   It was thus contended by the  Appellant  inter  alia,  that  the  Judge
    erred in law by applying to him a requirement that did  not  come  into
    force until long after the Appellant's application had  been  made  and
    decided.  The Rule change did not have any retrospective effect.

5.   In such circumstances it came as no surprise to me when at  the  outset
    of the hearing before me on 14 August 2014 Mr  Wilding  most  helpfully
    and realistically informed me as follows:

         "We accept that  there  is  an  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier
         Tribunal's decision in that it was before Appendix  O  was  brought
         in.


         Accordingly the Respondent cannot argue that all the results had to
         be in the same certificate and therefore it is  accepted  that  the
         First-tier Judge materially erred in law and we invite you  to  re-
         make the decision allowing the Appellant's appeal."


    In light of that concession I informed Mr  Hawkins  that  he  need  not
    trouble to address me.


Conclusions

6.   The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

7.   I set aside the decision.

8.   I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.



Signed                                  Date 19 August 2014
