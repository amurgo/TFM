Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Halstead, Counsel instructed by Chan Neill
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In this decision I refer to the appellant as the Secretary of State and
    to the respondent as the claimant.

 2. By my  decision  promulgated  on  6  January  2016  (appended  to  this
    decision), I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing
    the claimant's appeal against the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  to
    refuse her application for  leave  to  remain  under  the  Points-Based
    System as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and remade  the  decision  by
    dismissing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 3. However the claimant also claimed that her removal from the UK would be
    contrary to Article 8 of the ECHR.  As I did not  hear  submissions  on
    this issue, I adjourned the appeal in order  for  this  aspect  of  the
    claimant's claim to be remade at a resumed hearing. Accordingly, I  now
    remake the decision in respect of Article 8.

 4. I have been provided with  a  detailed  bundle  of  evidence  from  the
    claimant which I read in full before  the  hearing  and  I  heard  oral
    evidence  from  the  claimant  and  her  fianc�.  Very  limited  cross-
    examination was undertaken of them.  I found both the claimant and  her
    fianc� to be entirely credible in all respects and I fully  accept  the
    evidence that they gave.

 5. My factual findings are as follows:

      a) The claimant is a Chinese national born on 12 May 1988 who  entered
         the UK in 2007 on a student visa.  She  has  been  granted  further
         leave to remain on a number  of  occasions,  most  recently  on  11
         September 2012 when she was granted leave as a Tier  1  (Post-Study
         Work) migrant until 11 September 2014.

      b) On 9 September 2014 she applied for leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1
         (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  The application was  refused  because  she
         failed to provide  marketing  or  advertising  material  commencing
         before 11 July 2014, as required under the Rules.  The  reason  she
         failed to submit the required documents was not that  she  did  not
         have them (the evidence before me is that she did) but because  her
         then solicitors to whom she supplied the necessary documents failed
         to include them with the application.

      c) The claimant has made a complaint  to  the  Office  of  Immigration
         Services  Commissioner  which  was  upheld  in   respect   of   her
         solicitor's failure to submit the required documents. It  has  been
         intimated  that  she  may  bring  a  negligence  suit  against  the
         solicitors but that is not a matter for this hearing.

      d) The claimant has established  a  genuine  business  which  she  has
         invested  heavily  in  and  which  has  the   potential   to   grow
         significantly. The claimant claims that, if  her  appeal  succeeds,
         she will engage a full-time and part-time employee and  I  have  no
         reason to doubt this.

      e) Whilst in the UK she has developed a business and personal life and
         lost touch with friends in China.

      f) She is engaged to a Chinese national who is in the UK on a  Tier  2
         visa that expires in 2018.   He  will  be  eligible  to  apply  for
         permanent residence later this year.  He is well educated and works
         as a management consultant.

 6. I heard submissions from Mr Halstead and Mr Bramble.

 7. Mr Halstead did not seek to argue that the claimant could  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules and his case was that  the  claimant  should  succeed
    under Article 8 outside the Rules. He focused on  the  conduct  of  the
    claimant's  former  solicitors,  submitting  that  if  they  had  acted
    properly there is every reason to believe that the claimant would  have
    succeeded  in  her  application  under  the  Points  Based  System.  He
    highlighted the economic benefit the claimant brings to the UK and  her
    ability to speak fluent English. He submitted that the  only  equitable
    and fair outcome would be to find that  the  scales  in  the  balancing
    exercise under Article 8 tip  in  her  favour  and  that  it  would  be
    consistent with the case law on Article 8 to so find.

 8. Mr Bramble argued that even though it  is  clear  the  claimant  cannot
    satisfy the Immigration Rules, they should be the starting  point.  The
    Rule that she is most close to fulfilling is that  under  276ADE(1)(vi)
    whereby there must be very significant  obstacles  to  her  integrating
    into China. It was clear there  were  no  such  obstacles.  Mr  Bramble
    submitted that the claimant would be able to make a  fresh  application
    and that there were no compelling circumstances to  allow  this  matter
    outside the Rules.

Consideration

 9. Having considered the submissions  and  evidence  my  findings  are  as
    follows.

10. The claimant did not argue that she could satisfy the Immigration Rules
    and this clearly is correct, as highlighted by Mr Bramble.

11. Recent Court of Appeal case law (see, for example, SS Congo [2015] EWCA
    Civ 387) makes it very clear that where someone  cannot  succeed  under
    the Rules there must  be  "compelling  circumstances"  to  allow  their
    appeal outwith the Rules. The issue before me and to be  determined  in
    this appeal, therefore, is whether there are  compelling  circumstances
    to warrant the claimant being  granted  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Rules.

12. The claimant has lived in the UK for nine years during which  time  she
    has integrated into society, made friends, become engaged and  built  a
    business. For these reasons I am satisfied that  she  has  developed  a
    private life in the UK and that her removal from the UK would result in
    an interference with  that  private  life  of  sufficient  gravity  for
    Article 8 to be engaged.

13. I also accept that she has established a family life in the UK with her
    fianc�. Although he is also a Chinese national, their relationship  was
    formed and has developed whilst they were both living  and  working  in
    the UK and her fianc�, who is presently entitled to remain in  the  UK,
    has no wish to return to China.

14. Having found there to be a private and family life engaging Article  8,
    the remaining - and determinative - question is whether removal of  the
    claimant is proportionate.

15.  The  starting  point  for  this  analysis  is  Section  117B  of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which stipulate  a  series
    of  mandatory  considerations  to  be  taken  into  account  where  the
    proportionality of removal from the UK is at issue. I  apply  these  to
    the present case as follows:

      a)  Section  117B(1)  states  that  the   maintenance   of   effective
         immigration controls is in the public  interest.  Even  though  the
         claimant's failure to meet the Rules may well be due to  a  mistake
         by her solicitors, the essential fact is that she failed to satisfy
         the requirements of Rules.  Accordingly,  this  consideration  must
         weigh against her.

      b) Sub-Sections 2 and 3 of Section 117B state that it is in the public
         interest for an applicant  to  speak  English  and  be  financially
         independent.  I am satisfied that the claimant satisfies both.

      c) Sub-Section 117B(4) is not relevant as the claimant has been in the
         UK lawfully.

      d) Sub-Section 117B(5) states that little weight should be given to  a
         private life established when  a  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.  The client's immigration status in the UK has  at  all
         times been precarious as that term is understood in  this  area  of
         law and therefore little weight should be given to it.

16. Having regard to the aforementioned  considerations,  and  taking  into
    account all of the claimant's circumstances, it is clear that, although
    there are factors that weigh in her favour in  the  balancing  exercise
    under Article 8, there are no compelling reasons  (or  indeed,  reasons
    that come close to being compelling) that could justify a  decision  in
    her favour outside the Rules.

17. The claimant is a successful and educated  person  who  has  supportive
    family in China (for example, they helped fund her business) and  there
    is no evidence  before  me  to  show  she  would  have  difficulty  re-
    integrating into life in China  where  she  speaks  the  language,  has
    family and has the benefit of citizenship. Whilst she may not  be  able
    to continue the business she has developed in the UK there is no reason
    she would not be able to find employment or start another endeavour.

18. The claimant's private life  was  established  whilst  her  immigration
    status was precarious. She is engaged to a person in the  UK  but  that
    person is a Chinese national who presently has  precarious  immigration
    status  himself  (their  relationship  having  been   established   and
    developed whilst they both had a precarious immigration status).

19. In the claimant's favour is that she speaks English, is likely to be  a
    financial asset to the UK and may well have succeeded under  the  Rules
    if she had not been let down by  her  solicitors.  These  are  relevant
    factors, and they weigh in her  favour,  but  they  fall  significantly
    short of a "compelling reason" that could justify a finding that  leave
    to remain should be granted on the  basis  of  Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

20. Accordingly, I find that although removing the  claimant  from  the  UK
    would interfere with her private  and  family  life,  the  interference
    would be proportionate under Article 8 ECHR.

The appeal is dismissed.

Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr Kola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Singaraja, Counsel instructed by Garth Coates
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent (hereinafter "the claimant") is a citizen of China  born
    on 12 May 1988 who entered the  UK  in  2007  on  a  student  visa.  In
    September 2012 she was granted leave to remain until September 2014  as
    a Tier 1 (Post Study  Work)  Migrant.  Before  her  leave  expired  she
    applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

 2. The appellant  (hereinafter  "the  Secretary  of  State")  refused  her
    application on the basis that she did not submit with  her  application
    the marketing and advertising material  required  under  Paragraph  41-
    SD(e)(iii) of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

 3. At the  material  time,  Paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)  stipulated  that  an
    applicant must provide:

         '(iii) one or more of the following  specified  documents  covering
         (either together or individually) a  continuous  period  commencing
         before 11 July 2014 up to no earlier than three months  before  the
         date of his application:

             (1) advertising or marketing material, including printouts  of
             online  advertising,  that  has  been  published  locally   or
             nationally, showing the applicant's name (and the name of  the
             business if applicable) together with  the  business  activity
             or, where his business is trading online, confirmation of  his
             ownership of the domain name of the business's website,

             (2) article(s) or online links to article(s) in a newspaper or
             other publication showing the applicant's name (and  the  name
             of the business if  applicable)  together  with  the  business
             activity,

             (3) information from a trade fair, at which the applicant  has
             had a stand or given a presentation to  market  his  business,
             showing the applicant's name (and the name of the business  if
             applicable) together with the business activity, or

             (4) personal registration with a UK trade body linked  to  the
             applicant's occupation'

 4. In completing the application  form  the  claimant  ticked  a  box  (at
    section G26 of the form) to confirm she was supplying  advertising  and
    marketing material. Supplying this information would be  in  accordance
    with sub-paragraph (iii)(1). The form makes  clear  that  the  material
    provided must cover a continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014.



 5. The reason given by the Secretary of State for refusing the  claimant's
    application was that all of the material she submitted  in  respect  of
    marketing and advertising material was from after 11 July 2014.

 6. The claimant appealed and her appeal was heard by  First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT") Judge Sweet. In a decision promulgated on 24 June 2015, the FtT
    allowed the appeal "to the extent that the Secretary  of  State  should
    without  delay  reconsider  the  application  in  light  of   all   the
    documentation now produced".  The reasoning of the FtT was as follows:

      a) The  advertising  material  submitted  by  the  claimant  with  her
         application was from after 11 July 2014.

      b) The reason she failed to submit material from before 11  July  2014
         was because of an error by her solicitors.

      c) She  produced  to  the  tribunal  sufficient  material  to  satisfy
         Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii)

      d) Paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules can operate as a mechanism
         for relaxing the strictness of a particular requirement

 7. The FtT then concluded at paragraph [26]:

         "While I cannot conclude the Appellant has met all the requirements
         of the Immigration Rules on the balance of probabilities, I made  a
         find that the Secretary of State should reconsider the  application
         in light of the further documents produced, because I am  satisfied
         that on the balance of probabilities  she  is  likely  to  meet  he
         requirements under Appendix A."

 8. The Secretary of State's argument, as set out in the grounds of  appeal
    and elaborated by Mr Kola are that (a) this is an application under the
    Points Based System where only documents submitted with the application
    can be taken into account; and (b) paragraph 245AA  is  not  applicable
    because the Secretary of State had no reason to  believe  the  evidence
    existed.

 9. Mr Singarajah argued that paragraph 245AA must be considered  in  light
    of Sultana  and  Others  (rules:  waiver/further  enquiry;  discretion)
    [2014] UKUT 00540 (IAC) where the Upper Tribunal stated that  paragraph
    245AA "operates as  a  mechanism  for  relaxing  the  strictness  of  a
    particular requirement or requirements" and confirmed that an error  of
    law can arise from the Secretary of State's  failure  to  exercise  its
    discretion under the paragraph. He argued that this was  a  case  where
    the Secretary of State should have asked for more  documents  and  that
    the judge, following Sultanna, was not in error to so find.

10. Mr Singarajah also argued that even if the judge erred in  relation  to
    the Immigration Rules the appeal should  be  allowed  under  Article  8
    ECHR. The FtT determined, at paragraph [22], that the UK  would  be  in
    breach of Article 8 ECHR to return the claimant to China. Mr Singarajah
    submitted that the Secretary of State's grounds do not raise Article  8
    and therefore the FtT's Article 8 finding should stand irrespective  of
    my conclusion about the Immigration Rules.

Consideration

11. Under the Points Based System, the starting point, in  accordance  with
    section 85A(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  is
    that the FtT is only permitted to take into account material  that  was
    before the Secretary of State's decision maker. As summarised in  Ahmed
    and Another (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 365

         "... where a Points Based application  is  made  and  refused,  the
         assessment by the Judge is to be of the material  that  was  before
         the decision-maker rather than a new consideration of new material.
         In other words the appeal if it is successful is on the basis  that
         the decision-maker with the material before him should have made  a
         different decision, not on  the  basis  that  a  different  way  of
         presenting  the  application  would  have  produced   a   different
         decision."

12. The material before  the  decision  maker  in  this  case  was  plainly
    insufficient to find the claimant satisfied the Immigration Rules as by
    the claimant's own admission - and as found by the FtT - it  was  dated
    after 11 July 2014 whereas  the  Rules  specifically  require  that  it
    predates 11 July 2014.

13. This appeal therefore turns on whether the Secretary of State's refusal
    decision was not in  accordance  with  the  law  by  reference  to  the
    discretion afforded to it under  Paragraph  245AA  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

14. Paragraph 245AA, at the relevant time, stated as follows:

         '(a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part  6A  state
         that specified documents must  be  provided,  the  Entry  Clearance
         Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of  State  will  only
         consider documents that have been submitted with  the  application,
         and will only consider documents submitted  after  the  application
         where they are submitted in accordance with subparagraph (b).

         (b) If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:

             (i) Some of the documents in a sequence have been omitted (for
             example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);

             (ii)A document is in the  wrong  format  (for  example,  if  a
             letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or

             (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or

             (iv)  A  document  does  not  contain  all  of  the  specified
             information;

         the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or  the  Secretary
         of State  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his  representative  in
         writing, and request the correct documents. The requested documents
         must be received at the address specified in the request  within  7
         working days of the date of the request.'

15. The Upper Tribunal discussed the scope and purpose of  Paragraph  245AA
    in Sultana where at paragraph [25] it stated:

         "... where a decision  is  challenged  on  the  basis  of  unlawful
         failure to exercise a discretionary power  of  further  enquiry  or
         waiver ...  Judges  will  be  guided  by  considering  the  purpose
         underlying powers of this kind. We consider that such powers are to
         be  viewed  as  dispending  provisions,  designed  to  ensure  that
         applications suffering from minor defects or  omissions  which  can
         readily be remedied or forgiven do not suffer the draconian fate of
         refusal."

16. Paragraph  245AA  sets  out  four  categories  of  defect  in  material
    submitted with an application which the Secretary of State may seek  to
    rectify by requesting correct documents. The defect in  the  claimant's
    application was a failure to provide marketing or advertising  material
    commencing before 11 July 2014. The FtT has not explained why or how  a
    defect of this nature falls within any of the four categories and I  am
    not satisfied that it does. The application  form  made  clear  to  the
    claimant that she needed to provide material from before 11 July  2014.
    She failed to provide this. This was  not  a  case  of  there  being  a
    defect, or lack of certain information, in  documents  provided  by  an
    applicant. Rather, it is a case where the applicant  simply  failed  to
    submit the documents she needed to in order to comply with  the  Rules.
    Accordingly, there was no error on the part of the Secretary  of  State
    in failing to exercise discretion under paragraph  245AA  to  give  the
    claimant an opportunity to rectify the deficiencies in her application.
     I find, therefore, that the FtT has made a material error of law and I
    remake the decision to dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

17. The claimant has argued that if the appeal is  not  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules it should be allowed under  Article  8  ECHR  as  the
    Secretary of State failed to appeal the FtT's findings in this respect.
    I do not accept this argument.  The FtT's treatment  of  Article  8  is
    very brief. In a short paragraph  (paragraph  [22]  of  the  decision),
    without  developing  reasons,  the  FtT  states  that   it   would   be
    disproportionate to remove the claimant to China and cites  in  support
    of this contention the recent entry clearance case Mostafa [2015]  UKUT
    112. It is clear from the reference to Mostafa  that  the  point  being
    made by the FtT is that removal would be disproportionate under Article
    8 because the claimant meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules.
    Accordingly, to the extent the Secretary of State's appeal in  relation
    to the Immigration Rules is successful it is also successful in respect
    of the Article 8 finding by the FtT. In any event, it is not clear what
    the FtT has in fact found in respect of Article  8  as  the  Notice  of
    Decision makes no reference to Article 8 and reads as if the appeal has
    been decided solely under the  Immigration  Rules  notwithstanding  the
    discussion of Article 8  in  paragraph  [22].  Accordingly,  the  FtT's
    decision is set aside in its entirety.

18. As explained above in paragraph [16], I have remade the FtT's  decision
    in respect of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  dismissed  the  claimant's
    appeal. However, given the limited consideration of Article  8  by  the
    FtT and that I have not heard submissions in relation to the same,  the
    making of the decision  in  respect  of  Article  8  will  need  to  be
    adjourned for a further hearing, which will take place in this forum.

DECISION

19. For the reasons explained above, my decision is as follows:

     a) The decision of the FtT contained a material error of  law  and  is
        set aside.

     b) I remake the decision in  respect  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
        dismiss the claimant's appeal.

     c) With respect to the claimant's appeal under  Article  8  ECHR,  the
        remaking of the decision will be undertaken within this forum.

     d) No anonymity order is made.
