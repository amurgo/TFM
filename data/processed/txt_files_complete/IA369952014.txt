For the Appellant:     Ms P Heidar (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant's appeal against a decision to refuse to issue  him  with
    a residence card,  on  the  basis  that  he  met  the  requirements  of
    Regulation  15(1)(b)  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") was dismissed by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal in June 2015.  That decision was set aside, as containing
    material errors of law, on 14th January 2016.  The appeal was  retained
    by the Upper Tribunal, for the purpose of remaking the decision.

2.   The appellant relied  upon  the  evidence  contained  in  a  bundle  of
    documents prepared for the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  ("the  first
    bundle") and a  bundle  containing  bank  statements  and  credit  card
    statements ("the second bundle").

3.   The issue between the  parties  is  a  narrow  one.   In  refusing  the
    application for a residence card as confirmation of a  permanent  right
    to reside in the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State made an adverse
    finding that the appellant had not  shown  that  he  had  resided  here
    continuously for a period of five years.   Although  he  provided  bank
    statements, utility bills and similar items in support  of  his  claim,
    the decision maker found that there were too many periods  of  time  in
    which evidence was missing.

4.   In opening the case, Ms Heidar  said  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    bundle for the First-tier Tribunal hearing  included  a  summary  sheet
    that showed that the appellant entered the United Kingdom in 2004.   He
    applied for a residence card in 2010, on the  basis  of  his  marriage.
    The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal also included a copy  of  a
    page from the appellant's passport, issued in October 2010.  In seeking
    a residence card confirming a permanent right to reside, the  appellant
    had ticked the box confirming that proof of residence for the  required
    period of years accompanied  his  application.   In  the  first  bundle
    before the First-tier  Tribunal,  documentary  evidence  included  bank
    statements for June to July to  September  2009  and  for  January  and
    February 2010.  The second bundle  included  bank  statements  for  the
    period commencing in July 2010 and continuing until 2015.  At the  back
    of the second bundle there were credit card  statements  in  copy  form
    bearing dates from 2012 to 2016.

5.   The appellant also relied on a letter from his  GP  which  appeared  in
    the first bundle at page 85, confirming registration as a patient  from
    2005 and letters from his bank and his MP and utilities  bills  showing
    his presence in the United Kingdom in each of the years  from  2011  to
    2014.  The second bundle filled in some of the gaps.

6.   The  first  bundle  also  contained  witness  statements  made  by  the
    appellant and his wife, a Latvian citizen,  Aleksandra  Safi.   In  her
    statement, she confirmed that she has a right of permanent residence on
    the basis of  five  years'  continuous  residence  here,  as  a  person
    exercising treaty rights.  In the same bundle between pages 19  and  89
    were documents in Ms  Safi's  name  and  in  the  joint  names  of  the
    appellant and his wife, including their tenancy agreements.

7.   The appellant was called and  gave  brief  evidence.   He  adopted  the
    witness statement he made for the First-tier Tribunal  hearing.   There
    was no cross-examination.  Ms Safi then gave evidence and  adopted  her
    statement.  Each was in similar  terms.   Mr  Safi  drew  attention  to
    meeting his wife in November 2007, the commencement of cohabitation  in
    September 2009 and their marriage on 5th February 2010.  His  wife  was
    given a residence card as confirmation of a permanent right  to  reside
    here, on the basis  that  she  had  completed  five  years'  continuous
    residence in the United Kingdom as a person exercising  treaty  rights.
    The appellant's application for a similar document  was  made  in  July
    2014 and refused on 8th September that year.  Mr Safi  stated  that  he
    and his wife have lived  together  at  several  addresses.   Ms  Safi's
    statement referred  to  the  same  addresses  and  contained  the  same
    chronology regarding their relationship.

8.   Mr Tarlow said that reliance was placed on  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision letter.  He had no further submissions to make.

Findings and Conclusions

9.   In this appeal, the burden lies with the appellant to prove  the  facts
    and matters he relies upon and the standard  of  proof  is  that  of  a
    balance of probabilities.  As noted  earlier,  the  issue  between  the
    parties is  a  narrow  one.   Has  the  appellant  shown  a  period  of
    continuous residence here of  five  years,  so  that  he  falls  within
    Regulation 15(1)(b) of the 2006 Regulations?  He seeks a residence card
    confirming a permanent right of  residence,  similar  to  the  document
    issued to his wife.

10.  The  evidence  shows  overwhelmingly  that  the  appellant  has  indeed
    resided in the United Kingdom continuously for a  period  of  at  least
    five years.   Having arrived here in 2004, he met his wife in 2007  and
    their marriage took place in early 2010.  The first and second  bundles
    contain many copy bank statements, which fill most of  the  gaps  which
    concerned the decision maker when the application for a residence  card
    was refused.  Although one or two gaps remain,  they  do  not  remotely
    undermine the  appellant's  claim  and  the  other  documentary  items,
    including the letter from his GP and the utilities bills,  support  his
    case.  Weighing all the evidence together, I find  that  he  has  shown
    that he lived here continuously for a period of five years prior to the
    application for the document he sought in July 2014  and  the  evidence
    also shows that he has continued to reside here, with his  wife,  since
    then.  Overall, it is clear that he falls within Regulation 15(1)(b) of
    the 2006 Regulations.

11.  For these reasons, the appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

2016, it is remade as follows: appeal allowed.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

A fee of �140 was paid when  the  appeal  was  issued.   I  have  considered
whether to make a fee award.  Before the First-tier Tribunal,  the  evidence
adduced by the  appellant  in  documentary  form  did  contain  gaps.   This
deficiency was remedied when the second bundle was prepared, shortly  before
the decision was remade in the  Upper  Tribunal.   In  these  circumstances,
exercising the powers available to me, I make an  award  of  half  the  fee,
amounting to �70.
