Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Khan (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

         1. The Appellant, citizen of Bangladesh, was born on May  3,  1985.
            He entered the United Kingdom on December 16, 2012 with  a  six-
            month visa entitling him to enter the United Kingdom until  June
            4, 2013.  On May 29, 2013 he submitted an  application  to  vary
            his leave to enter. This application was  refused  on  June  20,
            2013 and at the same time a decision to remove him under section
            47 of the Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006  was
            taken.

         2. On July  4,  2013  the  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
            Tribunal under Section 82(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
            Act 2002 (hereinafter called the 2002 Act), as amended,  and  on
            January 28,  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Hussain
            (hereinafter called "the FtTJ") heard his appeal.  He  dismissed
            his appeal in a decision promulgated on March 27, 2014.

         3. The Appellant lodged grounds of appeal  on  April  4,  2014  and
            permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
            Tribunal Lambert on May 14, 2014. Permission was granted because
            the FtTJ had failed to make  any  findings  on  the  appellant's
            private or family life. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Lambert
            made  clear  in  her  permission  that  the  FtTJ  had  properly
            considered the appellant's "asylum" and "article 3" claims.

         4. The matter came before me on the date  set  out  above  and  the
            sponsor and her daughter were present.

         5. Ms Everett accepted that the failure by the FtTJ  to  deal  with
            original application was an error in law. She accepted the  FtTJ
            appeared to have concentrated on asylum grounds  and  overlooked
            the real reason the application had been made despite the record
            of proceedings recording the representatives' submissions on the
            very issue.

         6.  Mr  Khan  asked  whether  I  would  revisit  the  part  of  the
            application that had been refused as  he  submitted  there  were
            inadequate reasons. Having considered the determination and both
            Mr Khan's and Ms Everett's  submissions  I  was  satisfied  that
            there was  no  reason  to  revisit  this  issue.  The  FtTJ  had
            considered relocation and found this possible and there  was  no
            evidence before the FtTJ that suggested this was  not  possible.
            The First-tier Judge  had  considered  similar  submissions  and
            rejected them.

         7. In those circumstances I was left  with  the  error  of  law  on
            family and private life grounds.

         8. Mr Khan submitted that as the FtTJ had not considered  this  the
            matter should be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
            hearing on the appellant's claim. Ms Everett had no strong views
            on the matter.

         9. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

      "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement
      Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
      Tribunal finds that the making of the decision concerned involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside
      the decision and, if it does so, must either remit  the  case  to  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)   or   proceed   (in
      accordance with relevant Practice Directions) to re-make the  decision
      under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


      The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed  to  re-
      make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½


      a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


      b) the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."


        10. I did consider retaining this matter in the Upper  Tribunal  but
            came to the conclusion that as there had been  no  consideration
            whatsoever of his family  or  private  life  that  this  was  an
            appropriate case to be remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
            also had regard to the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  changed
            solicitors and new witnesses were to be called  to  support  the
            claim and currently there were no statements from them.

        11. The appellant's nearest hearing centre was  Taylor  House  so  I
            agreed to remit the case to that  centre.  In  light  of  a  new
            policy at Taylor House I was  unable  to  fix  a  date  but  the
            listing department in due course will allocate the date.

        12. I made the following directions:

 i. The case will be listed for a two-hour oral  hearing  at  Taylor  House
    Hearing Centre.


ii. The appellant's  representatives  must  file  and  serve  on  both  the
    Tribunal and respondent a bundle of any documents that are to be relied
    on for the next hearing to include witness statements from  any  person
    to be called. Such statements will stand as evidence-in-chief.

iii. The appellant's bundle  of  documents  must  be  filed  no  later  than
    fourteen days before the next hearing date.

iv. A Bengali (Sylheti) interpreter is required.

 v. For the sake of clarity the hearing  is  confined  to  the  appellant's
    claims for private and family life only.

    Decision

        13. The making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
            involve the making of an error on  a  point  of  law  only  with
            regard to the appellant's private and family  life.  The  FtTJ's
            other decision stands.

        14. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
            fresh appeal hearing under Section 12 of the  Tribunals,  Courts
            and Enforcement Act 2007.
