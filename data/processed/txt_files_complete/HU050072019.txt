For the Appellant:     Mr Sobowale, Counsel instructed by Salam Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh born in 1984.  The Respondent
    seeks to deport him on the grounds that he is a 'foreign criminal', the
    Appellant having been convicted in 2017 of possession of Class A  drugs
    (MDMA, cocaine) plus a quantity of cannabis, with intent to supply, and
    he having been sentenced to 3 years in prison.


 2. The Appellant seeks to resist  deportation  on  human  rights  grounds;
    specifically, he contends that his removal would  have  'unduly  harsh'
    consequences for his children and/or that  there  are  very  compelling
    circumstances  in   his   case   which   render   his   deportation   a
    disproportionate interference with his Article 8 rights.



    Case History

 3. The decision to deport  was  taken  on  the  10th  January  2018.   The
    Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.


 4. On the 11th July 2019 the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Meyler)  allowed
    the deportation appeal on Article 8 grounds, finding that it  would  be
    unduly harsh for the Appellant's children to remain living here without
    him.

 5. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, which was granted on  the  3rd  October  2019  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Parkes.   Various grounds were advanced before me at a hearing
    on the 7th November 2019 but the crux of the Respondent's case was that
    the reasons for the First-tier Tribunal decision were unclear  to  her.
    Although the Tribunal plainly states its conclusion that life  for  the
    children without their father would be unduly harsh,  its  reasons  for
    reaching that conclusion are left unspecified.  The Secretary of  State
    placed reliance  on  a  number  of  Court  of  Appeal  decisions  which
    emphasise that there must  be  something  out  of  the  ordinary  in  a
    family's situation to elevate the distress that a child  will  face  to
    the level of 'undue harshness'.

 6. I find the grounds to be made  out.  At  paragraph  34  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision records that  the  children  are  all  close  to  the
    Respondent and that they would miss him if he were to be deported;   at
    least in respect of the stepdaughters their biological father would not
    permit them to visit the Respondent in Bangladesh.   Neither  of  these
    reasons are capable of supporting  a finding that the deportation would
    have 'unduly harsh' consequences  for  the  children  of  this  family.
    Nowhere is the actual impact of family breakup explored. In my  written
    decision of the 8th November 2019 I found that the Secretary  of  State
    was entitled to complain that she cannot understand the  basis  of  the
    decision. The grounds having been made out, the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal was set aside.

 7. The case has now returned to me to be re-made.



    The Evidence

 8. I was given the following unchallenged evidence about  the  Appellant's
    immigration history. He arrived in the United  Kingdom  in  April  1991
    when he was 6 years old.  He had  leave  to  enter  as  a  visitor;  it
    appears that he was left in  the  United  Kingdom  by  his  mother  who
    returned to Bangladesh without him. He has lived here  ever  since.  In
    December 2008 the  Secretary  of  State  accepted  that  the  Appellant
    qualified for Indefinite Leave to  Remain  on  the  basis  of  the  old
    'fourteen years' concession  in  the  Immigration  Rules.   That  leave
    pertained until the 10th January 2018 when  it  was  curtailed  by  the
    signing of the deportation order.


 9. The Appellant has three criminal convictions, all accrued in 2016/2017;
    he was sentenced for all of them on the 5th November  2017.   The  most
    serious are the two counts of possession with intent to supply a  Class
    A controlled drug (cocaine and MDMA); he  was  also  convicted  of  one
    count of acquiring/using/possessing  criminal  property.  The  sentence
    imposed was 2 x 3 years, to be served concurrently.

10.  At  the  hearing  the  Appellant  explained  the  background  to   his
    convictions. He had never before been in trouble with  the  law.  As  a
    young man he did a lot of sport and in approximately 2013 he  sustained
    an injury to his anterior cruciate ligament. He was in a lot  of  pain,
    for which he  was  prescribed  painkillers  by  his  doctor.  A  friend
    suggested that he supplement these  painkillers  by  smoking  cannabis.
    Although he had not before tried any street drugs the  Appellant  began
    to regularly smoke cannabis, and through this was introduced  to  other
    drug users, and dealers. He progressed to  using  cocaine.  He  started
    spending a lot of money that he didn't  have.   At  one  point  he  was
    spending about �200 per week on cocaine. He fell  into  debt  with  the
    dealers.  He had no way  of  paying  this  debt  off,  and  so  it  was
    suggested to him that he undertake some work for them.  In his evidence
    before me the Appellant appeared genuinely exasperated at  himself  for
    having made that decision.  He  reckons  that  he  was  selling  drugs,
    including Class A's, on the streets  in  Chester  for  approximately  5
    months before he was arrested.

11. The Appellant then gave what was fairly described by Mr Bates,  in  his
    subsequent submissions, as unusually "candid and credible" evidence  of
    his  remorse  and  rehabilitation.  He  explained  that  in  prison  he
    undertook a victim  awareness  course  specifically  tailored  to  drug
    offenders. He came  to  understand  that  a  single  drug  deal  has  a
    "butterfly effect" where multiple people are adversely  affected.   The
    drug user himself is impacted, in his health and wellbeing, but this in
    turn can have consequences for his family, his wife and  children,  not
    just emotionally but financially - because the money  that  is  funding
    his habit he could be  funding  his  family.  Further  afield  it  also
    impacts on medical staff and the NHS, which ends up having to foot  the
    bill when things go wrong. The Appellant also  explained  that  another
    consequence of dealing is further crime,  as  users  like  himself  get
    sucked into offending to pay  for  their  habit.    For  all  of  those
    reasons the Appellant avers that he feels ashamed of his criminal  past
    and asks me to accept that he has learned his lesson. He  regrets  what
    he has done.

12. Although I had no up to date evidence from the probation service I  did
    have an OAsys report prepared in May 2019 which stated that the service
    at that time predicted that there was a  3%  chance  of  the  Appellant
    reoffending within 3 years,  and  no  risk  at  all  of  the  Appellant
    committing any further serious offences. All drug  tests  conducted  in
    prison came back negative and the Appellant avers that he has been drug
    free since 2016.


13. The Appellant married his wife Ms RS in 2012. They  have  two  children
    together, and three step-children. Since  I  have  made  an  order  for
    anonymity to protect the identity of these children I  shall  refer  to
    them, in descending age order, as C1-C5.  All five are girls, currently
    aged 19, 15, 12, 5, and 3�.   The three eldest girls,  the  Appellant's
    step-daughters, have always lived with their mother. They have  regular
    contact with their father who lives nearby. Their father has written to
    the court to state that he would not permit them to go to Bangladesh.

14. I heard live evidence from Ms RS and received written  statements  from
    the three eldest children.  I deal with those statements first.

15. C1 is now at university. She is reading law at Chester. C1 writes  that
    she has lived with her stepfather since she was 11 years old  and  that
    she has in that  time  benefitted  from  a  stable  and  secure  family
    environment. She states that  the  Appellant  plays  an  important  and
    active role in the household and then when he was in prison she and her
    sisters all suffered emotionally and  psychologically.   Since  he  has
    been out he has resumed his position - he helps with chores, transports
    the little ones to and from school and encourages his stepdaughters  to
    study hard. C1 expresses concern  at  her  mother's  ability  to  cope.
    Whilst she was in a position to help out when he  was  in  prison,  now
    that she is at university her  capacity  to  do  so  will  be  limited.
    She writes that she and her sisters are "stressed and  confused"  about
    what will happen to their family should the Appellant be removed.

16. C2's letter is dated April  2019,  when  the  Appellant  was  still  in
    prison. Strikingly she opens it by describing him as her "best friend".
    She states that she and her sisters, and their mother, miss him a  lot:
    "these past 18 months have been really tough for me and my family". She
    expresses concern about  her  mother's  ability  to  cope  without  the
    Appellant, and sets out why she would not  be  able  to  leave  Chester
    where she has established friends and extended family.

17. C3 states that she loves living in her family  home  with  her  mother,
    stepfather and sisters. They are a happy family.  She  knows  that  her
    step-father regrets what he has done and just wants  to  be  there  for
    them now.  She explains the ties that she has to the United  Kingdom  -
    her father and extended family as well as her school and friends -  and
    states that she does not know what would happen to her  family  if  her
    step-father had to leave. She is worried about her little  sisters  who
    are "crazy about their dad" but who are also part of her family unit.

18. Ms RS adopted her witness statement and  gave  further  oral  evidence.
    She  confirmed  that  she  is  the  mother  of  the  Appellant's  three
    stepdaughters, two daughters, and that she has another on the way:  her
    estimated date for delivery is in May of this year.    She explains how
    she and the children endured serious hardship when  the  Appellant  was
    sent away. She struggled to cope with the children on her own  and  had
    to look to her eldest daughter for help. She became  emotional  in  her
    evidence as she described how she now owes her daughter  money  arising
    from money she borrowed during that period.  C1 also  spent  a  lot  of
    time helping her with the younger kids and deliberately chose to attend
    university in her home town because she was worried about  leaving  her
    mum. This appeared to be personally distressing for RS, who feels  like
    she has let her daughter down: "she's just a kid - I don't want to hold
    her back".   RS described how she kept  the  truth  from  her  youngest
    daughters because she didn't know how to explain  to  them  that  their
    father was in prison. She told them that he  was  working  away.  Every
    week they would go and visit him and the kids would  cry  when  it  was
    time to leave dad at "work".  Sometimes the guards had to help her  get
    them out of the visiting room because  they  would  cling  to  him  and
    shout.  To this day C4 has lasting emotional issues  arising  from  her
    father's imprisonment. She is very clingy  to  him  and  gets  up  most
    nights in the week to check that he is still in the house. He  gets  up
    and settles her.   Despite all of that RS has no regrets about marrying
    the Appellant.   She loves him and  says  that  he  is  a  "brilliant",
    "active and loving" father.

19. Various members of the Appellant's extended family and  social  network
    have written letters in support of his  case.   I  do  not  propose  to
    summarise all of this evidence but I can confirm that I have  read  all
    12 of the letters written I have been sent.  Three main themes  emerge:
    that he is committed to his rehabilitation, has a strong bond with  his
    family,  and  that  his  criminal  behaviour  was  shockingly  out   of
    character.  I summarise only two of the letters, which serve to  convey
    the views of all of the writers.

20. The Appellant's British cousin LA has written a  lengthy  and  detailed
    statement setting out how let down he and other family members felt  by
    the Appellant's criminal behaviour,  and  how  out  of  character  they
    regard it as being. Mr Ali had regular contact with  the  Appellant  in
    the two years  he  spent  bailed  on  remand  prior  to  sentence,  and
    continued to visit him in prison. During  that  period  he  formed  the
    impression that the Appellant was truly repentant for  his  crimes  and
    was committed to his rehabilitation: "he did everything that was  asked
    of him. He was like  an  open  book  with  his  heart  visibly  on  his
    sleeves". LA comments that the Appellant is particularly  close  to  C4
    but that he has a "great bond of love and affection" with  all  of  the
    children. LA  further opines that the Appellant no  longer  belongs  in
    Bangladesh, and that he must have experienced  emotional  "chaos"  when
    his parents left him here. Conversely he has grown  up  in  the  United
    Kingdom and has a real sense of belonging here.

21. Another cousin, JN describes the Appellant as being  someone  who  will
    always go out of his way for others - she gives several examples of his
    kindness towards her over the years and speaks warmly of his  parenting
    skills.   She writes:

         "For someone that got abandoned and neglected by  his  own  parents
         during childhood I was very nervous before he embarked on the  next
         chapter of his life...getting married and having children, but once
         again [the Appellant] proved his  ability  to  love  and  give  his
         children  what  he  didn't  have,  got  past   his  own  unorthodox
         upbringing and personal struggles. When he was out on bail I  spent
         many evenings with [the Appellant] and his wife  his  own  children
         and stepchildren, in  their  family  home.  We  would  pop  'I'm  a
         Celebrity' on whilst he cooks up a big roast, talk and laugh around
         the dinner table, it was genuinely a beautiful  environment  and  I
         was fortunate to have shared such fond memories with him".


22. When I asked  the  Appellant  for  his  comment  on  this  evidence  he
    explained that after he was abandoned here by his mother  his  extended
    family closed in to take care of  him.  LA,  JN,   his  other  cousins,
    siblings, aunts and uncles are all extremely close  to  him.  He  feels
    deeply ashamed of how he let them down and knows how disappointed  they
    all were in him.  These relatives are regarded by the Appellant as  the
    sum total of his natal family. He has no direct contact with either his
    parents or an elder brother who  remains  in  Bangladesh,  although  he
    heard news about them from time  to  time  from  his  aunty  here.  The
    Appellant explained that he has not had a relationship with his parents
    since they left him here, because as a young child he was resentful and
    heartbroken that they left him here. He did not want to talk  to  them.
    He understands that they migrated to the United States'  several  years
    ago. He has some memory of his brother from when they were children but
    has had no contact with him since he arrived here in 1991. He has  been
    told by his  aunt  that  his  brother  has  significant  mental  health
    problems and has never been able to work. Although he is married he  is
    not able to support his own family and in fact lives in his  father-in-
    law's house.


23. The Appellant said that if he is allowed to remain here  he  hopes  one
    day to run his own business. He has done lots of different jobs in  the
    catering  industry  -  he  has  worked  back  and  front  of  house  in
    restaurants and he believes that he has what it takes to do that  alone
    - either a family run restaurant or maybe starting with a little  take-
    away. One of the courses that he completed in prison was in relation to
    this (he also undertook further study in maths and English).



    The Law


    The Legislative Framework


24. The Respondent's decision to deport is taken pursuant to section  32(5)
    of the UK Borders Act 2007 which requires the  Secretary  of  State  to
    make a deportation order against any person who is  a)  not  a  British
    citizen and b) is convicted in the UK of an offence  for  which  he  is
    sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months.   Such  an
    individual is a 'foreign criminal'.


25. The foreign criminal may resist deportation is he can show that one  of
    the 'exceptions' to the automatic deportation  procedure  applies.  The
    exceptions are set out at s33 of the Borders Act 2007. In  this  appeal
    the Appellant submits that his case engages the exception at s33(2)(a):
    he submits that his deportation would contravene his rights  under  the
    European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 8.

26. The composite rights protected by Article 8 - private and family life -
    are qualified rights with which interference may be  justified  on  the
    basis of various  legitimate  aims  which  include  the  prevention  of
    disorder or crime. The way  in  which  the  question  of  justification
    should be approached where a court or tribunal is required to determine
    whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts breaches  Article  8
    is governed by Part  5A  (  sections  117A-117D)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended by s19 of  the  Immigration
    Act 2014).


27. Section 117B, which applies to all Article 8 cases, provides:

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
         cases


         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public
         interest.


         (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the
         economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
         enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English,
         because persons who can speak English-


           (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the
         economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
         enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent,
         because such persons-


           (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (4) Little weight should be given to-


           (a) a private life, or
           (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,


         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United
         Kingdom unlawfully.


         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at
         a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.


         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public
         interest does not require the person's removal where-


           (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
         relationship
           with a qualifying child, and
           (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
           United Kingdom.


28. Section 117C sets out the  additional  considerations  to  be  made  in
    deportation cases:


         117C Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving
         foreign criminals

         (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.

         (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
         public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4) Exception 1 applies where-

         (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of
         C's life,

         (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom,
         and

         (c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration
         into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.

         (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
         requires deportation unless there are very compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and
         2.

         (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted.




    Private Life


29. To defeat deportation action on private  life  grounds  claimants  must
    satisfy the three-limb test at s117C (4). The meaning of each of  these
    requirements has been recently considered by the Court of Appeal in  CI
    (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA  Civ
    2027.


30. Where there is any ambiguity about whether residence was  'lawful'  (as
    in for instance Akinyemi v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    [2017] EWCA Civ 236) the  focus  for  enquiry  should  be  whether  the
    individual was removable at the given time, recalling that the point of
    the provision is to remind the decision maker that little weight should
    be attached to a private life developed when the  individual  concerned
    was well aware that he had no right to be here [see �40].

31. In assessing whether a "foreign criminal" is "socially  and  culturally
    integrated in the UK", it  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  the
    rationale behind the test is to determine whether the person  concerned
    has established a private life in the UK which has a substantial  claim
    to protection under Article 8 [at �57].  Approving the ratio of Uner  v
    The Netherlands (2006) 45 EHRR 14 the Court held:

         "58.  Relevant social ties  obviously  include  relationships  with
         friends and relatives, as well as ties formed through employment or
         other paid or unpaid work  or  through  participation  in  communal
         activities. However, a person's  social  identity  is  not  defined
         solely by such particular relationships but  is  constituted  at  a
         deep level by familiarity with  and  participation  in  the  shared
         customs, traditions, practices, beliefs, values, linguistic  idioms
         and other local knowledge which situate a person in  a  society  or
         social group and generate a sense of belonging. The  importance  of
         upbringing and education in the  formation  of  a  person's  social
         identity is well recognised, and its importance in the  context  of
         cases involving the Article 8 rights of  persons  facing  expulsion
         because of criminal offending has been recognised by  the  European
         Court. Thus, in the Uner case at para 58, the court  considered  it
         "self-evident"  that,  in  assessing  the  strength  of  a  foreign
         national's ties with the "host" country in which they  are  living,
         regard is to be had to "the special situation of  aliens  who  have
         spent most, if not all, of their childhood  in  the  host  country,
         were brought up there and received their education there."






         59. The European Court returned to this theme in Maslov  ,  stating
         (at para 73) that:


         "... when assessing the length of  the  applicant's  stay  in  the
         country from which he or she is to be expelled and the solidity of
         the social, cultural and family ties with  the  host  country,  it
         evidently makes a difference  whether  the  person  concerned  had
         already come to the country during his or her childhood or  youth,
         or was even born there, or whether he  or  she  only  came  as  an
         adult."

32. As to whether criminality itself is capable of breaking such links, the
    Court held that it self-evidently is, but it depends on the facts:



         62.  Clearly, however, the impact  of  offending  and  imprisonment
         upon a person's integration in this country will depend not only on
         the nature and frequency of the offending, the length of time  over
         which it takes place and the length of time spent  in  prison,  but
         also on whether and how deeply  the  individual  was  socially  and
         culturally integrated in the UK to begin with. In  that  regard,  a
         person who has lived all or almost all his life in the UK, has been
         educated here, speaks no language other than (British) English  and
         has no familiarity with any other society  or  culture  will  start
         with much deeper roots in this country than someone who  has  moved
         here at a later age. It is hard to see how criminal  offending  and
         imprisonment could ordinarily, by themselves and unless  associated
         with  the  breakdown  of  relationships,  destroy  the  social  and
         cultural integration of someone whose entire  social  identity  has
         been formed in the UK. No doubt it is  for  this  reason  that  the
         current guidance ("Criminality: Article 8 ECHR  cases")  that  Home
         Office  staff  are  required  to  use  in  deciding   whether   the
         deportation of a foreign criminal would breach  Article  8  advises
         that:

         "If the person has been resident in the UK from a very early age it
         is unlikely that  offending  alone  would  mean  a  person  is  not
         socially and culturally integrated."




33. In respect of the final limb, the  ability  to  integrate  abroad,  the
    Court approved the dicta in Kamara v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  813  to  the  effect  that  it  is   the
    individual's capacity to re-establish a private life  in  that  country
    which is at the heart of the test:


          "The idea of 'integration' calls for a broad  evaluative  judgment
         to be made as to whether  the  individual  will  be  enough  of  an
         insider in terms of understanding how life in the society  in  that
         other country is carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so
         as to have a reasonable opportunity to be  accepted  there,  to  be
         able to operate on a day-to-day basis in that society and to  build
         up within a reasonable time a variety  of  human  relationships  to
         give substance to the individual's private or family life".






34. The Court further cautioned that it cannot be assumed that someone will
    fit into the country to which he is to be deported because he is "from"
    there.   The inference that the individual will have  an  understanding
    of, for instance,  'cultural norms' will  only  be  open  to  decision-
    makers if there is some actual evidence that this is the case.






    Family Life


35. Section 117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    stipulates that foreign criminals may resist automatic  deportation  on
    grounds of their family life where they can demonstrate that  it  would
    be 'unduly harsh'  on either their  children,  or  qualifying  partner,
    should the deportation proceed. In determining the  threshold  of  harm
    that must be found before that test is met I remind myself that  it  is
    not the highest of the three proportionality benchmarks  found  in  the
    statutory scheme. In the case of non-deportees seeking leave to  remain
    the focus must be on whether it is 'reasonable' to expect  a  child  to
    leave the United Kingdom; for 'serious  offenders' (ie those who get at
    least four years in prison) the very highest hurdle of 'very compelling
    circumstances' must be  surmounted;  'medium  offenders'  such  as  the
    Appellant are found somewhere in the middle, and are required to  prove
    'undue harshness'.


36. That the test is found midway in the spectrum should  not  obscure  the
    fact that it is  a  high  test.   The  higher  courts  have  repeatedly
    emphasised that the 'commonplace'  distress  that  will  be  caused  to
    children if a parent is removed is not sufficient: otherwise any parent
    facing deportation would be able to succeed.  Dicta to this effect  can
    be found in the Court of Appeal decisions in Secretary of State for the
    Home Department v PG (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ 1213,   BL  (Jamaica)  v
    Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  357,
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  v  AJ  (Zimbabwe)  and  VH
    (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 1012 and NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662.  It was further underlined
    in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2018]
    UKSC 53 where [at �27] the Supreme Court  endorsed  the  dicta  of  the
    Upper Tribunal in MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) as  to  what  kind  of  suffering  the
    statute is here concerned with:


          "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh' does
         not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or  merely
         difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated threshold.
         'Harsh' in this context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It  is
         the  antithesis  of  pleasant  or  comfortable.  Furthermore,   the
         addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an already elevated standard
         still higher."


37. The Supreme Court further held that in undertaking  the  assessment  of
    whether deportation  would  have  unduly  harsh  consequences  for  the
    deportees children the decision-maker must be concerned solely with the
    impact upon the child. Neither  the  Appellant's  criminality  nor  any
    other adverse matters of character should  be weighed in the balance.




    Very Compelling Circumstances


38. As I note above, s117C(6) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 stipulates that those foreign criminals who have committed the
    most serious of crimes - those for which they  are  sentenced  to  four
    years of more - can only  rely  on  Article  8  to  defeat  a  proposed
    deportation where they are able to show that there are "very compelling
    circumstances over and above" the existing exceptions.   The  Court  of
    Appeal considered this  problematic  formulation  in  NA  (Pakistan)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662 and drew
    three important conclusions. First, the Court found  there  to  be   an
    obvious drafting error in the section, since given its natural  reading
    the clause would only avail  the  most  serious  of  offenders,  whilst
    excluding those on medium sentences. The Court  accordingly  held  that
    s.117C(3) is to be construed as containing such a  fall-back  provision
    for medium, as well as serious, offenders.  Second, the Court held that
    the terminology "over and above" could only sensibly  be  construed  to
    relate to an equivalence  of  harm  to  the  matters  outlined  in  the
    exceptions.  Thus the deportee wishing to rely on this  provision  must
    show that there are very compelling circumstances  in  his  case  which
    attract a greater weight that would be attached to, for  instance,  the
    removal being 'unduly harsh' for a child.  Finally, the words "over and
    above" do not prevent a  person  facing  deportation  from  relying  on
    matters falling within the scope of the  'exceptions'  in  this  second
    stage of the analysis.


39. Unlike 'undue harshness' decision makers must  here  give  appropriate,
    and generally substantial,   weight  to  the  public  interest  in  the
    removal of foreign  criminals,  and  any  compelling  features  of  the
    evidence must be weighed against that public interest:  MS  (s.117C(6):
    "very compelling circumstances") Philippines [2019] UKUT  00122  (IAC).
    This being the highest of the three proportionality benchmarks set  out
    in the statute the circumstances in which that public interest will  be
    outweighed are going to be extremely rare,  or  'exceptional'.      The
    test invites a holistic evaluation, taking all relevant  factors  -  ie
    not just those referred to in Part 5A - into account.

40. Recent examples of 'very compelling circumstances'  identified  in  the
    higher courts include Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  v
    Garzon  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1225  where  the  proposed  deportee  had  a
    significant number of convictions including serious offences of GBH and
    supply of Class A drugs.    Although Garzon  had  failed  to  establish
    that his deportation would be unduly harsh for his  daughter  (whom  he
    rarely saw), or that there  were  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration in his native Colombia, the Court upheld the finding of the
    First-tier  Tribunal  that  there  were  nevertheless  very  compelling
    circumstances in his case. These were that he had lived in  the  United
    Kingdom for 40 years, having arrived as an  eleven-year  old,  and  was
    deeply integrated into  the  United  Kingdom.  He  had  a  very  strong
    relationship with his partner  and  had  shown  good  evidence  of  his
    rehabilitation.   The Court noted that unlike the appellant in  Mwesezi
    v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1104
    Garzon was a medium offender. Although Mwesezi could also rely on  very
    long residence, in the end the nature of his offending  was  such  that
    the public interest prevailed (he had received a sentence  of  6  years
    for unlawful possession of a firearm and live ammunition).


41. Another recent case in which the Court  of  Appeal  considered  factors
    that  might  contribute  to  'very  compelling  circumstances'  is   CI
    (Nigeria) (supra): there very long residence, the fact that much of the
    period of unlawful leave occurred in childhood, mental  illness  and  a
    tragic family history were all held to be potentially relevant.




    Discussion and Findings


    Liability to Deportation


42. I am satisfied that the Appellant is a foreign criminal and that he  is
    therefore liable to deportation.








    Exception 1


43. I must now consider whether the Appellant can show his  deportation  to
    be disproportionate on 'private life' grounds.


44.  I find as fact that the Appellant has  lived  in  the  United  Kingdom
    since 1991.   When he arrived he was 6 years old. I am  satisfied  that
    the Appellant has lived continuously in the United Kingdom since  then.
    He is today 35 years old. Accordingly I am satisfied that the Appellant
    has spent most of his life in this country.

45. In his submissions Mr Sobowale pointed  out  that  at  page  7  of  the
    refusal letter the Respondent expressly concedes that the Appellant has
    lived in this country lawfully for most of his life. Mr  Sobowale  then
    quite properly conceded that whoever wrote that letter appears to  have
    miscalculated. The Appellant is now 36 years old. Although he has spent
    approaching thirty years in this country only ten of  those  years  was
    with leave: when the Appellant arrived he had a valid visit visa,  that
    expired sometime towards the end of 1991 and he  was  not  granted  any
    form of leave until the 10th December 2008.  From that  point  he  held
    leave until the 10th  January  2018  when  the  Deportation  Order  was
    signed.   I am not therefore satisfied that  this  residence  has  been
    'lawful' for most of the Appellant's life.     Of his  approximate  30-
    year residence, only ten years was 'lawful'. I return to issues arising
    below, but I am satisfied that the Appellant  cannot  technically  meet
    the requirements of 'exception 1'.

46. Mr Sobowale nevertheless asked me  to  make  findings  on  whether  the
    Appellant was socially and  culturally  integrated  into  life  in  the
    United Kingdom, and whether there would be very  significant  obstacles
    to his integration in Bangladesh.

47. I accept without hesitation, as did Mr Bates,  that  the  Appellant  is
    socially and culturally integrated in the United  Kingdom.  I  have  no
    doubt that to the external observer he would appear to all intents  and
    purposes British.  The Secretary of  State  did  not  submit  that  the
    Appellant's  criminality  has  severed  or  even  interfered  with  the
    Appellant's long-standing and significant ties to this country.

48.  As to the situation in Bangladesh I accept that the Appellant has very
    little memory or understanding of how that country works. He  would,  I
    have no doubt, be trying to establish himself there  without  his  wife
    and children, since the familial ties of C1-C3 make it  impossible  for
    them to leave.   There is no evidence before me to  indicate  that  the
    knowledge of  Bengali  culture  that  he  may  have  gleaned  from  the
    diasporic community in the United Kingdom over the past 30 years  would
    be of much practical assistance to  him  in,  for  instance,  obtaining
    work. I have no doubt that the Appellant would find his deportation  to
    be  a  significant  challenge.  On  arrival  he  would  be  lonely  and
    bewildered. I cannot however find that the obstacles he would face  are
    such that he would not be able to found a private life for  himself  in
    that country. He speaks some Bengali, and as was clear  from  his  oral
    evidence, the Appellant is a personable and intelligent man. He is  fit
    and well. He has extensive experience in the restaurant trade  and  has
    some qualifications.  As all of the supporting witnesses attest, he  is
    a kind and helpful man who would be an asset to any employer. I have no
    doubt that he would be able to make friends. I do not underestimate the
    challenge that deportation will represent for the Appellant, but  I  am
    unable to accept that  his  private  life  in  Bangladesh  would  be  a
    nullity, or that he would face very significant obstacles.



    Exception 2


49. Exception 2 requires the Appellant to show that his  deportation  would
    have 'unduly harsh' consequences for his wife or children.   I  am  not
    satisfied that he has done so.


50. I fully accept  that  the  Appellant  has  a  meaningful,  genuine  and
    subsisting  parental  relationship  with  these  five  children   -   I
    particularly stress that I am satisfied that this is the case not  only
    in regard his own two daughters, but that this is also  the  nature  of
    his relationship with his  stepdaughters,  each  of  whom  has  made  a
    heartfelt plea that he be allowed to remain in their  home.   The  fact
    that those girls have maintained  a  relationship  with  their  natural
    father does not prevent them from looking to the Appellant in  the  way
    that they do for love, support and guidance.

51. I fully accept that it would be strongly contrary to the best  interest
    of these children should the Appellant be deported. It is striking that
    the additional witnesses (ie not members of the family)  all  speak  of
    the warmth and close-knit nature of this family unit, and I do not need
    expert evidence to accept that it would be very much to  the  detriment
    of these children should  that  be  taken  away.  They  will  miss  the
    Appellant.  His  absence  will  place  a  considerable  strain  on  the
    household, with Ms RS and the older  children  having,  inevitably,  to
    perform tasks that have hitherto been undertaken by the Appellant.    I
    accept Ms RS's evidence that she is anxious about her ability to  cope.
    I fully accept that all of that.

52. I cannot however allow an appeal because these children or Ms  RS  will
    be unhappy, or distressed.    These are  the  obvious  consequences  of
    deportation, and  parliament  has  specifically  mandated  that  it  is
    generally acceptable that the families of foreign criminals are  broken
    up. As Lord Justice Sedley put it in Lee v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 348 [at �27]: "the  tragic  consequence
    is that this family..., will be broken  up  for  ever  because  of  the
    appellant's bad behaviour.  That is what deportation does".    The test
    of 'undue harshness' should not be interpreted  in  an  unrealistically
    high way, but nor should it be read to reflect any adverse consequence.
    As I note above, the Courts have repeatedly  emphasised  that  sadness,
    or the 'commonplace' distress that children will experience in losing a
    parent from the family home is not a matter of  sufficient  gravity  to
    engage the  exception.    The  high  point  of  the  evidence  was  the
    testimony of the  Appellant  and  his  wife  in  relation  to  C4,  the
    Appellant's eldest child who is now aged 5. It  is  their  unchallenged
    evidence that this child found the Appellant's absence from the  family
    home particularly hard to bear, and that she still gets up at night  to
    check that he has not left; she  is  described  as  "very  clingy"  and
    tearful if she thinks that the Appellant is going out.  Whilst I do not
    doubt the descriptions given to me by the witnesses, this evidence,  as
    sad as it is, is not sufficient to meet the high threshold in the test.
     There is no evidence before me to  suggest  for  instance,  that  this
    child will suffer any more significant adverse  consequences  that  any
    child whose father is deported.   I have to set the evidence  about  C4
    in the context of her wider family circumstances - she  has  a  mother,
    sisters, and extended family who love and support her.  The consequence
    for her of her father's deportation will undoubtedly be harsh  but  the
    evidence falls short of establishing that it is unduly so.

53. I appreciate that this will be hard for  Ms  RS  and  the  children  to
    understand. They did not commit a crime, and yet the  legislation  asks
    that it is they  who   pay  the  price.  I  have  given  that  my  full
    consideration, but  in  the  absence  of  any  particular  evidence  of
    hardship, of "severe" or "bleak" consequences, I am unable to find  the
    burden of proof discharged on this matter.



    Very Compelling Circumstances

54. The Appellant has not succeeded in demonstrating  that  either  of  the
    'exceptions' in s117C are made out.   I am nevertheless asked to assess
    whether there are very  compelling  circumstances  in  his  case  which
    would,  exceptionally,  render  his  deportation  disproportionate.   I
    remind myself  that  here  I  must  undertake  a  holistic  evaluation,
    weighing the strong public  interest  in  the  Appellant's  deportation
    against  all  relevant  factors.  These   may   include   matters   not
    contemplated in the legislation, as well as those which  are  expressly
    recognised as relevant by Part 5A.


55. I begin by marking the substantial weight to be attached to the  crimes
    committed by the Appellant. He was convicted on three counts but as  he
    readily acknowledged, there could have been many more,  given  that  he
    had been engaged in street dealing for some  5  months  before  he  was
    caught.   The seriousness of the offences was properly reflected by the
    Crown Court in the Appellant's sentencing to 3 years' in prison.  Class
    A drugs use is consistently and rightly described  as  a  scourge.  The
    Appellant described a street level drug deal  as  having  a  'butterfly
    effect' - causing adverse consequences far and  beyond  the  individual
    user.  Drug use causes misery in all sorts of ways.

56. Having placed that heavy weight on the Secretary of State's side of the
    scales I remind myself that it will only be a very strong  case  indeed
    that is capable of outweighing it.  I am satisfied that this is such  a
    case.

57. In explaining my reasons I have adopted  the  structure  used  by  Lord
    Justice Leggatt in the lead judgment in CI (Nigeria) [from �93  on]:  I
    do so simply because I have to start somewhere, and I make  clear  that
    these reasons are not ranked in order of importance. I have  taken  all
    of them into account, and find that their cumulative weight means  that
    the appeal should be allowed.

58. The Appellant could not meet any of the exceptions, but  he  came  very
    close to doing so.   Whilst it would be impermissible to treat a  'near
    miss', or simply a collection thereof,  as  creating  "very  compelling
    circumstances", these factors remain relevant to the overall  balancing
    exercise: see Jackson LJ in NA (Pakistan) [at �32]:

         "... if all he could advance in support of his article 8 claim  was
         a 'near miss' case in which  he  fell  short  of  bringing  himself
         within either Exception 1 or Exception 2, it would not be  possible
         to  say  that  he  had  shown  that  there  were  'very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2'. He would need  to  have  a  far  stronger  case  than  that  by
         reference to the interests protected by article 8 to bring  himself
         within that fall back protection. But again, in principle there may
         be cases in which such an offender can say  that  features  of  his
         case of a kind described in Exceptions 1  and  2  have  such  great
         force for article 8 purposes that  they  do  constitute  such  very
         compelling  circumstances,  whether  taken  by  themselves  or   in
         conjunction with other  factors  relevant  to  article  8  but  not
         falling within the factors described in Exceptions  1  and  2.  The
         decision maker, be it the Secretary of State or  a  tribunal,  must
         look at all the matters  relied  upon  collectively,  in  order  to
         determine whether they are sufficiently compelling to outweigh  the
         high public interest in deportation."

59. The first consideration is the Appellant's private life. The  Appellant
    has unquestionably lived in this country for most -  approximately  80%
    - of his life.   Of the thirty years he has spent here  only  ten  have
    been with valid leave. That is why he failed to meet  the  requirements
    of the first limb of exception 1.  I must however weigh in the  balance
    that for the first 12 years that he was here the Appellant was a  child
    who cannot sensibly be held responsible for  his  lack  of  immigration
    status, or more importantly have been expected to desist from forming a
    private life in case he was removed: see CI  Nigeria  [�100]  and  Miah
    (section 117B NIAA 2002 - children) [2016] UKUT 00131(IAC).    I  would
    also observe that it appears entirely likely that the  Appellant  would
    have been granted British nationality had he applied for it between  at
    least 2012 (when he had accrued five years' residence  with  indefinite
    leave) and 2016 (the date of his first offence), although since I heard
    no argument on the point I attach no additional weight to that matter.


60. The Appellant met the requirements in the second limb of exception 2 by
    showing that he was "socially and culturally integrated"  into  British
    life.  That scant statement does not really do justice to the life that
    the Appellant has here.   The Appellant has, I accept, only the haziest
    of memories of Bangladesh. His entire primary and  secondary  education
    was completed in this country. All  of  his  friends  are  British,  or
    resident here. He has worked here and built good  relationships  within
    the restaurant trade.  He has a large extended  family,  many  of  whom
    live very close by in Chester, and it  is  these  people  that  he  now
    regards as his family, his emotional bonds to his  own  parents  having
    been abruptly severed in 1991 when they "abandoned" him here, the  term
    strikingly used by other members of the family as well as the Appellant
    himself.  He has played sports and gone out in the United Kingdom as  a
    young man. Now that he has a family of his own their  idea  of  a  good
    night in is, as JN attests, having a roast dinner in front  of  'I'm  a
    Celebrity'.   That is a family unit to which the  Appellant  is  deeply
    committed.


61. In CI (Nigeria) Lord Justice Leggatt states  that  "a  person's  social
    identity is not defined solely by such particular relationships but  is
    constituted at a deep level by familiarity with  and  participation  in
    the shared customs, traditions, practices, beliefs, values,  linguistic
    idioms and other local knowledge which situate a person in a society or
    social group  and  generate  a  sense  of  belonging":  applying  those
    considerations I find the Appellant's  social  identity  to  be  deeply
    rooted in this country.  It is a factor of great significance  in  this
    case, and I recognise the dicta in Uner and  Maslov  v  Austria  [2009]
    INLR 47 regarding the "the special situation"  of  settled  aliens  who
    have spent most, if not all, of their childhood in  the  host  country,
    were brought up there and received their education  there.  Whilst  the
    Appellant committed his offences as an adult (cf Maslov) his very  long
    residence remains a potent factor in his favour [at �75 Maslov]:


         "In short, the court considers that for a settled migrant  who  has
         lawfully spent all or the major part of his or  her  childhood  and
         youth in the host country, very serious  reasons  are  required  to
         justify expulsion."

62. I was not satisfied that the Appellant  is  able  to  demonstrate  that
    there are very significant obstacles to his integration in  Bangladesh.
    Ironically for him, that finding largely  rests  on  his  own  positive
    character traits: his willingness to work hard,  his  intelligence  and
    resourcefulness and his friendly nature.   He would find the adjustment
    to life in Bangladesh hard, really hard, but he would in time  be  able
    to establish a private life for himself. That is not to  say  that  the
    suffering to be experienced by the  Appellant  by  his  deportation  is
    irrelevant to my decision. I find it inconceivable that  his  wife  and
    children will go with him. As I  have  said,  wholesale  relocation  is
    simply not an  option  open  to  this  family  because  C1-C3's  father
    continues to play an active role in their lives.   Ms RS was  born  and
    brought up in this country and there is no part of her that wants to go
    and live in Bangladesh.  I accept that the separation of the  Appellant
    from his family will  be  devastating  for  him,  an  emotional  impact
    compounded by the fact that he will know how difficult they are finding
    his absence to be.  This is not a factor that has attracted  very  much
    weight in my reckoning,  since it  is  of  course  the  case  that  the
    Appellant must be expected  to  pay  the  price  for  his  criminality.
    Deportation will, by its nature, result in suffering for the individual
    concerned. I simply make the points I have in order to  underline  that
    this is not a case where the proposed deportee will be returning  to  a
    country with which he has some recent familiarity, or where  he  has  a
    family or friends who can assist him.


63. This brings me to the Appellant's family. I have  explained  above  why
    the distress caused by deportation in this case, even to C4, would  not
    to my mind be sufficient to demonstrate 'undue harshness'. As I hope  I
    have made clear, I do not seek by that finding to diminish the hurt and
    panic that this household feels when they contemplate life without  the
    Appellant.  I am mindful of  my  finding  that  it  would  be  strongly
    contrary to the best interests of these  children  if  he  were  to  be
    removed, and that this  has  contributed  some  weight  to  my  overall
    evaluation.

64. The final, very significant, factor that has weighed in the Appellant's
    favour is this. I have rarely, if ever, come across a case where I  was
    more  convinced  of  the  Appellant's  contrition,  regret,  and   deep
    understanding of the harm that he has caused to himself, his family and
    wider society by his offending.  All of the evidence before me  -  from
    the Appellant, from those who know him  best  and  from  the  probation
    service - pointed one way.   The likelihood of the Appellant committing
    any further offences is extremely slim. This is a  young  man  who  got
    involved in something he shouldn't, fell in way too deep and  ended  up
    committing  an  extremely  serious  criminal  offence.  I  am  entirely
    satisfied that it is not a mistake that he is going to make again.

65. For all of those reasons I  am  satisfied  that  the  very  substantial
    weight to be attached  to  the  public  interest  in  removing  foreign
    criminals is, exceptionally, outweighed on the particular facts of this
    case.





    Anonymity Order

66. The Appellant is a foreign criminal and as such he would not ordinarily
    have the benefit of an order for anonymity. This  decision  is  however
    concerned with a number of children. I am concerned that identification
    of the Respondent could lead to identification of  those  children.  As
    such I am  satisfied,   having  had  regard  to  the  guidance  in  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders,  that  it
    would be appropriate to make an order in accordance with Rule 14 of the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 in the following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him, any of his witnesses  or
        any member of his  family.   This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
        others, both the Appellant and the Respondent.  Failure  to  comply
        with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions

67. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


68. There is an order for anonymity.

69. I re-make the decision in the appeal as follows: the appeal is  allowed
    on human rights grounds.
