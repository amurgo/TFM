                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Portugal.  His date of birth is  19  July
    1977.

 2. I  make  an  order  for  anonymity  to  protect  the  identity  of  the
    Appellant's son, a minor.

 3. On 5 April 2018  the  Secretary  of  State  made  a  deportation  order
    pursuant to Regulation 24(3)  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") against the  Appellant.
    This followed his conviction on 6 October 2016  in  relation  to  three
    counts  of  making  indecent  photographs  or  pseudo  photographs   of
    children,  possession  with  intent  to  supply  a  class  A  drug  and
    possession with intent to supply a  class  B  drug.   In  addition  the
    Appellant was convicted of possession of a class B drug.  The Appellant
    was sentenced to 38 months imprisonment.  He  was  made  subject  to  a
    sexual harm prevention order. He is required to sign the sex offender's
    register for life.

 4. The Appellant appealed against the Secretary  of  State's  decision  to
    deport him.  His appeal was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal  in  a
    decision that was promulgated on 15 July 2019.  The Upper  Tribunal  (a
    panel comprising Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley and Upper Tribunal Judge
    McWilliam) found that the First-tier Tribunal made a material error and
    set aside its decision.  The error of law decision reads as follows:-

         "12.     The judge addressed risk factors  at  paras.  66  and  70.
             Essentially the judge agreed with the sentencing judge in 2016
             that the Appellant remains in denial as to the desire  on  his
             part to access indecent  images  of  young  children  and  she
             concluded that he 'appears to  minimise  his  responsibility'.
             The judge found that the nature of the  offences  demonstrated
             'poor judgment' and the Appellant 'refuses  or  is  unable  to
             recognise the real damage of the offences'.

         13.  Whilst the judge  was  entitled  to  take  a  view  about  the
             Appellant's lack of self-awareness, she did  not  sufficiently
             engage with the evidence of the OASys Report (specifically the
             triggers  identified  therein  as  increasing  the   risk   of
             reoffending) together with the Appellant's evidence about  his
             present circumstances.  This was material to the assessment of
             risk.  The Appellant  was  unrepresented.   His  evidence  was
             capable of supporting that the trigger factors  identified  in
             the OASys Report were  not  engaged.   Whilst  the  sentencing
             judge opined that the Appellant was in denial about why he was
             looking  at  the  images  and  that  he  did  not  accept  the
             Appellant's explanation that he was trying to distract himself
             from  self-harming  and  having  suicidal  thoughts,  he  also
             identified him as suffering from depression,  being  estranged
             from his family, vulnerable  and  lonely.   The  OASys  Report
             identified particular risk factors including drug  taking  and
             relationships.  The Appellant's evidence before  the  FtT  was
             that he was working, had  the  support  of  his  daughter  and
             family who lived close by and that he  is  not  taking  drugs.
             The Appellant's daughter's evidence was capable of  supporting
             this.  He was living with his brother whilst at  the  time  of
             the commission of the offences he was living alone.  There was
             additional evidence of support from family  members.   If  the
             Appellant was still in  denial,  whilst  this  is  capable  of
             indicating  a  level  of  risk  of  offending,   it   is   not
             determinative of the issues in this appeal.   A  more  nuanced
             assessment of  risk  is  required,  taking  into  account  all
             material evidence.

         14.  The judge at para. 73 said there was  sufficient  evidence  of
             the Appellant's role as a father.  Whilst  the  Appellant  did
             not live with MM, there was evidence from the  child's  mother
             that he was a good father and close to his children.  There is
             no assessment by the judge  of  the  child's  best  interests.
             This error infects  the  assessment  of  proportionality.   In
             addition, at para. 74 the judge considered  the  situation  of
             the Appellant's son as  though  this  was  a  case  where  the
             Appellant was claiming to have a derivative right of residence
             which is not the approach to proportionality.

         15.  Had the judge not made the errors identified in  the  grounds,
             we cannot be certain that she  would  have  reached  the  same
             conclusions.  There is another serious error in  the  decision
             regarding the level of protection afforded to  this  Appellant
             and whether this was properly understood and  applied  by  the
             judge.  Whilst she  correctly  recorded  that  the  Presenting
             Officer conceded that the Appellant  had  permanent  residence
             and she set out the correct law, at no point in  the  decision
             did she indicate the  level  of  protection  afforded  to  the
             Appellant  or  find  that  the  decision  to  deport  him  was
             justified on serious grounds of public policy.  Paras. 47  and
             58 in our view further muddies the  water.   The  judge  found
             that  there  is  'a  real  risk  of  the  Appellant's  further
             commission of a criminal offence in  the  future'.   This  was
             based on the Appellant being 'unable  to  recognise  the  real
             damage of the offences'.  The judge had to decide whether  the
             decision was justified on serious  grounds  of  public  policy
             because of the threat presented by the  Appellant  within  the
             framework of the 2016 Regulations."

 5. The panel made a series of directions about the filing and  service  of
    evidence under Rule 15(2A) of the 2008 Procedure Rules. We directed the
    Appellant to serve and  file  a  consolidated  bundle  not  later  than
    fourteen days before the hearing.

 6. The matter came before a panel on 12 March 2020 (Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    McWilliam and Upper Tribunal Judge O'Callaghan).  On this  occasion  Mr
    Ballara  representing  the  Appellant  made  an  application   for   an
    adjournment.  He told the Tribunal that the  Appellant's  daughter  and
    his ex-wife were unable to attend the hearing to give evidence  because
    they were unwell with flu-like symptoms.  He informed  the  panel  that
    their evidence  was  crucial.   Mr  Jarvis  who  was  representing  the
    Secretary of State did not oppose the application.  However, the  panel
    expressed concern that the Appellant had  failed  to  comply  with  the
    directions  of  the  Tribunal.   The  panel  reminded  the  Appellant's
    solicitors of their obligations under Rule 2 of the  Tribunal Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  Further directions were  made,  including
    that the parties were to file and serve skeleton arguments.  The matter
    was listed before me on 24 November 2020 for a remote hearing.

The Appellant's criminality

 7. As a result of a police search of his home, the Appellant was found  to
    have  320  indecent  images  on  his  computer  which  included  images
    categorised as the most serious category A images, including  those  of
    children under 10.  He  was  sentenced  to  three  offences  of  making
    indecent images.

 8. He pleaded guilty to  possession with intent to supply class  A  drugs,
    possession with intend to supply class B drugs and possession of  class
    B drugs.   He was found to be in possession of 30 grams of cocaine  and
    a kilo of cannabis.  The Appellant entered a guilty plea on  the  basis
    that he did not know that cocaine had been stored at his  home.  On  17
    November 2016 he was  sentenced  to  38  months  imprisonment  for  all
    offences.

 9. The salient parts of His Honour Judge Moss's sentencing  comments  read
    as follows

         "... you have  been  here  a  number  of  years  with  no  previous
         convictions.  You suffer from depression  and  are  estranged  from
         your family.  You were living in a  one  bedroom  rented  flat,  it
         appears to this court that you are someone,  who  is  ...  somewhat
         vulnerable, lonely and without very much prospect for  making  very
         much of your life.  If I have not  said  it  already  you  have  no
         previous convictions.

         The police attended your address in relation to indecent images and
         found on your computer a total of  320  images,  the  most  serious
         being count 1, category A images including two movie  files;  there
         were ten of those involving young  girls  age  under  10  who  were
         displaying distress.

         I do not accept your explanation for why you were looking at  those
         images, which is that you were trying  to  distract  yourself  from
         self-harming and having suicidal thoughts.   I  think  you  are  in
         denial about your  interest  in  children.   This  is  an  entirely
         separate offence from the drugs, the guidelines indicate a starting
         point of twelve months' custody.

         In light of everything I have heard, and also to ensure that  there
         is sufficient time for you to seek help whilst you are  in  custody
         from the  prison  hospital  authorities,  and  that  when  you  are
         released which you will be having served half of your sentence, you
         will be on licence and I hope that you will maintain  contact  with
         Mental Health Services in order to sustain what I hope will be some
         progress for you  in  custody,  and  indeed  hope  you  will  avoid
         involvement with drugs.

         If you breach the terms of your licence on release you  are  liable
         to be recalled to prison to serve the remainder of your sentence.

         The report that I have  suggests  that  there  is  no  intervention
         required in relation to your viewing of indecent images.  I am  not
         persuaded by the reasoning of the author  of  the  report,  and  it
         seems to me the opportunity should be taken, if available  to  you,
         to address the fact that you were  attracted  to  viewing  indecent
         images of young children".

The  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016  ("the  2016
Regulations")

10. The Appellant appeals against deportation under the  2016  Regulations.
    The relevant parts of which provide: -

Decisions taken on grounds of public  policy,  public  security  and  public
health

    27.- (1)      In this regulation, a "relevant decision" means an EEA

             on serious grounds of public policy and public security.

         (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

             (a)  has a right of permanent residence under regulation 15
                  and who has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous
                  period of at least ten years prior to the relevant
                  decision; or

             (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant decision is
                  in the best interests of the person concerned, as provided
                  for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted
                  by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 20th
                  November 1989.

         (5)  The public policy and public security requirements of the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise conferred
             by these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision is taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-

             (a)  the decision must comply with the principle of
                  proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)  the personal conduct of the person must represent a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society, taking into
                  account past conduct of the person and that the threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

             (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case or
                  which relate to considerations of general prevention do
                  not justify the decision;

             (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions do not in
                  themselves justify the decision;

             (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative grounds, even
                  in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided
                  the grounds are specific to the person.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public
             policy and public security in relation to a person ("P") who
             is resident in the United Kingdom, the decision maker must
             take account of considerations such as the age, state of
             health, family and economic situation of P, P's length of
             residence in the United Kingdom, P's social and cultural
             integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of P's
             links with P's country of origin.

         (7)  In the case of a relevant decision taken on grounds of public
             health-

             (a)  a disease that does not have epidemic potential as
                  defined by the relevant instruments of the World Health
                  Organisation or is not a disease listed in Schedule 1 to
                  the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010; or

             (b)  if the person concerned is in the United Kingdom, any
                  disease occurring after the three month period beginning
                  on the date on which the person arrived in the United
                  Kingdom,

             does not constitute grounds for the decision.

         (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether the requirements of
             this regulation are met must (in particular) have regard to
             the considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations of
             public policy, public security and the fundamental interests
             of society etc.).

The Appellant's evidence

11. The Appellant did not submit any further evidence but he relied on  the
    evidence that was before the First-tier  Tribunal.   He  gave  evidence
    through a Portuguese interpreter, as did his ex-wife, "AM".

12. The Appellant and AM made witness statements, dated 21 April  2020  and
    May 2020 respectively. The Appellant's adult daughters, "RM"  and  "GM"
    prepared statements of 6 May 2020.  There were witness statements  from
    wider family, the Appellant's brother and his wife.

13. There was a letter in the Appellant's bundle from  YTD  Limited  of  25
    November 2020 which confirms that the  Appellant  was  recruited  as  a
    warehouse operator starting from 1 January 2019 and that  he  had  been
    working full-time since then.

14. The Appellant in his witness statement says he married his  ex-wife  on
    21 January 2006. They have three children, RM (born on 17 March  1995),
    GM ( born on 27 November 1998) and the Appellant's youngest  child  "N"
    (born on 1 November 2003).  The Appellant has lived in the UK  since  1
    April 2007.  He and his wife separated in 2011. They divorced  in 2016.



15. At the time of the offences he was depressed and had suicidal  thoughts
    post the breakdown of his marriage.  He was vulnerable and  "fell  into
    wrong  hands".The  Appellant   regrets   his   criminality.    He   has
    rehabilitated and reformed.  He is remorseful, which  is  reflected  in
    his constant efforts to better himself  and  tackle  the  root  of  his
    offending.  He has completed a number of courses.

16. The Appellant and his ex-wife have made  arrangements  for  him  to  be
    actively involved in the lives of their children.   His  daughters  are
    adults but they are still dependent on him.  His son, N,  has  autistic
    spectrum disorder and attended a special needs school. He  now  attends
    college.   AM appreciates that the children would suffer if he  was  no
    longer present.  He would be unable to financially maintain the family.
     The Appellant was supported by his family throughout the time when  he
    was in prison.

17. The Appellant in oral evidence he said that he presently sees  N  every
    Sunday. They go to the cinema together and shopping. They have lunch at
    McDonald's. He  cannot give him support with his college  work  but  he
    incentivises him.  It was very hard for N while the  Appellant  was  in
    prison.  His mother told him  that  the  Appellant  was  travelling  to
    explain his absence.  During the period he did not do well  at  school,
    however now he has started  to  succeed.  N  does  not  know  that  the
    Appellant may be deported.  He gives his ex-wife �80, �50 or  sometimes
    �200 a month.

18. The ties  that the  Appellant  once had in Portugal and Brazil have now
    been severed. He does not have the  capital  to  rebuild  his  life  in
    either. He would not be able to cope without his family.

19. In oral evidence, the Appellant said that he was misunderstood  by  the
    sentencing judge. He was aware that what  he  did  was  wrong  and  the
    consequences of his actions. At the time of offending he was  sick.  He
    was suffering from depression. He had  never  used  or  accessed  those
    websites before.  He went into a depression after the breakdown of  his
    marriage in 2011. He was self-harming and thinking of ending his  life.
    He is not a paedophile.  Each time he tries to explain why he  accessed
    those sites he is told that he does not accept responsibility. He is no
    longer in contact with the two men who  were  involved  with  the  drug
    offences. He assisted the police in apprehending  them.  The  Appellant
    used drugs in exchange for letting them  use  his  accommodation.  They
    gave him an ounce of cannabis per month for doing so.  While in  prison
    he did courses in English and maths.

20. The Appellant has got to  know  himself  much  better  since  going  to
    prison. He has psychological help. He  is  working.  He  does  not  use
    drugs.  During cross-examination he explained what  he  meant  when  he
    said that he had been misunderstood by the sentencing  judge.  He  said
    that he was put in a corner and asked why and he tried to  respond  and
    this made matters worse.  The judge heard what he wanted to hear.    He
    was searching the internet about suicide and images came  up  which  he
    tried to delete.

21. The Appellant said that he takes an  interest  in  life  again.  He  is
    getting to know himself better. He has had sessions with a nurse and he
    has been helped by the Samaritans.  He had Colour Therapy in prison.

22. The Appellant's ex-wife gave oral evidence which was broadly consistent
    with that of the Appellant.

Submissions

23. The parties relied on skeleton arguments which I will summarise.

24. The Secretary of State conceded that  the  Appellant  has  a  permanent
    right of residence.  It was not accepted that the Appellant is entitled
    to the highest level of protection under the 2016 Regulations.

25. To calculate whether the Appellant  has  acquired  enhanced  protection
    requires the decision maker to count back from the date of deportation:

    49 which in this case is 5 April 2018.  This period  was  significantly
    interrupted by the Appellant's imprisonment for very serious sexual and
    drug related offences.

26. In Onuekwere v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  (case  C-
    378/12) [2014] 1 WLR 2420, the CJEU confirmed as follows  at  paragraph
    26:

         "The imposition of a prison sentence by the national court is  such
         as to show the noncompliance  by  the  person  concerned  with  the
         values expressed by the society of the host  member  state  in  its
         criminal law ...".

27. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v Denis Viscu [2019] EWCA
    Civ 1052 Flaux LJ (with whom the other members  of  the  court  agreed)
    stated at [44]:

         "(i) that the degree of protection against  expulsion  to  which  a
             union national resident in another member  state  is  entitled
             under  the  Directive  is  dependent  upon   the   degree   of
             integration of that individual in the member state;

         (ii) that, in general, a custodial  sentence  is  indicative  of  a
             rejection of  societal  values  and  thus  of  a  severing  of
             integrative links with the member state; but

         (iii)    that the extent to which  there  is  such  a  severing  of
             integrative links will depend upon an  overall  assessment  of
             the individual's  situation  at  the  time  of  the  expulsion
             decision".

28. An overall assessment of the Appellant's situation  taking  account  of
    his offending behaviour and the control measures  resultingly  imposed,
    demonstrates that as at the relevant date his  integrative  links  with
    the UK were wholly severed.  The Appellant cannot benefit from enhanced
    imperative protection from expulsion.  Accordingly, the appeal must  be
    assessed against the medium level of protection under the Regulation.

29. It is asserted that the  Appellant's  conduct  constitutes  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat.  He was made subject to Multi-
    Agency Public Protection  Arrangements  (MAPPA)  level  1  due  to  the
    continuing risk he poses to the public.  He has been assessed as posing
    a medium risk of serious harm to children.

30. The sentencing judge was not persuaded by the reasoning of  the  author
    of a  pre-sentence report (PSR) and rejected  the  Appellant's  claimed
    reasons for viewing indecent  images  of  children,  stating  that  the
    Appellant was "in denial"  about  his  "interest  in  children".    The
    sentencing judge's conclusions are relevant to the  assessment  of  the
    Appellant's credibility, as well as the threat he poses to  society  in
    the United Kingdom in general and in particular to children.

31. There are serious grounds of public policy. The Appellant represents  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.

32. The threat presented by the Appellant is a weighty factor.  In MC (Essa
    principles recast) Portugal [2015] UKUT 520, the Upper  Tribunal  noted
    at paragraph 10 as follows:-

         "In the absence of integration and a right of permanent  residence,
         the future prospects of integration  cannot  be  a  weighty  factor
         (Dumliauskas  [44]  and  [54]).   Even  when  such  prospects  have
         significant weight they are not a trump card, as what the Directive
         and the 2006 EEA Regulations require is  a  wide  ranging  holistic
         assessment.  Both recognise that  the  more  serious  the  risk  of
         reoffending, and the offences that a person may commit, the greater
         the right to interfere with the right of residence (Dumliauskas  at
         [46] and [54])".

33. It is submitted that the Appellant is not integrated  into  UK  society
    and  accordingly  his  future  prospects   of   rehabilitation   cannot
    constitute a weighty factor.  The Secretary  of  State  relies  on  the
    refusal letter.  The matters said to weigh in  the  Appellant's  favour
    are outweighed in the balancing exercise.  In respect of Article 8  the
    Appellant is unable to show that the effects of  deportation  would  be
    unduly harsh upon any qualifying partner or  child  with  reference  to
    section 117C of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.
    There  will  be  no  very  significant  obstacles  to  the  Appellant's
    integration into society in Portugal  which  is  an  EU  member  state.
    There  are  no  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above   the
    exceptions to deportation.

34. The Appellant submits that the Respondent's skeleton argument is  based
    on the  previous  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  despite  the
    decision having been set aside.   This is a fresh appeal. The  starting
    point is that the Appellant has permanent residence.  Any decision must
    be proportionate and based on his personal conduct  with  reference  to
    Regulation 27(5) of the 2016 Regulations.

35. The Upper Tribunal is asked to note that  the  period  of  imprisonment
    does  not  break  the  continuity  of  residence  with   reference   to
    Tsakouridis [2010] EUECJ  C-145/09,  [2011]  Imm  AR  267  and  P.I.  v
    Oberb�rgermeisterin  der  Stadt  Remscheid  (Freedom  of  movement  for
    persons) [2012] EUECJ C-348/09 (22 May 2012).

36. In deciding whether the Appellant is entitled  to  enhanced  protection
    there must be an overall assessment of the Appellant's  integration  in
    the UK.  Time in prison  does  not  automatically  break  his  integral
    links.  The Appellant relies on B v Land  Baden-W�rttemberg  (C-316/16)
    and Secretary of State for the Home  Department  v  Vomero  (C-424/16).
    The Appellant arrived in the UK in 2007.  He has been here  for  twelve
    years.  He was imprisoned between November 2016 and April  2018.   This
    does not break  his  integrative  links  here.   The  strength  of  the
    Appellant's appeal lies in his relationship with N.   It  is  submitted
    that the Appellant is entitled to  enhanced  protection  and  that  his
    deportation would be disproportionate.  N's best interests are  central
    to the balancing exercise.

37. Mr Tufan in oral submissions said that the Appellant's son is aged  17.
    He is approaching adulthood. It is suggested that he is suffering  from
    autism, however there is no medical report to support this.  Even if he
    is autistic,   the  Appellant's  contribution  is  limited.   There  is
    supervised contact.   He  drew  my  attention  to  what  he  said  were
    inconsistenices in the evidence. The Appellant  does  not  show  proper
    remorse.  He remains a danger to the community.   He  was  assessed  as
    posing a low risk of reoffending and a medium risk of harm.   Mr  Tufan
    drew my attention to MA (Pakistan) [2014] Civ 163 at  paragraph  19  is
    concerned with a low risk of  reoffending  and  JZ  (Colombia)  v  SSHD
    [2018] EWCA Civ.

38. Mr Belara in response relied on his skeleton argument and asked  me  to
    attach  weight  to  the  evidence  of  the   Appellant's    ex-   wife.
    Deportation  cannot  be  justified  on  grounds  of  deterrence.    The
    Appellant came here in 2007.  He was sentenced  in  2016,   six  months
    short of ten years.  His integrative links were very strong before  the
    Appellant went to prison.

39. The tribunal must take into account what the Appellant did before going
    to prison.  It cannot be said  that  he  has  a  propensity  to  commit
    offences. He has contact with his children and family in the UK.  It is
    accepted that applying a mathematical calculation the Appellant  cannot
    establish continuity of residence, however his  integral  links  remain
    intact.  Although the offences are very serious there is a low risk  of
    reoffending. He is not a persistent offender. He does not have  a  drug
    problem.  The Appellant plays a  strong  part  in  N's  upbringing.  He
    provides financial support to his  family.  It is in N's best  interest
    that he remains here.  It is unreasonable to expect N to visit  him  in
    Portugal.  Such disruption  would  have  a  grave  impact  on  N.   The
    decision  to  deport  the  Appellant  is  not  proportionate   in   the
    circumstances.

What level of protection applies?

40. In the case of Hafeez v the Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2020] EWCA Civ 406, the Court of Appeal said as follows:

         "37. In my view, periods of imprisonment (or detention in  a  young
             offenders' institution: Viscu v SSHD [2020] 1 All ER  988)  do
             not  count  positively   towards   establishing   ten   years'
             residence. I have reached this conclusion for three reasons.

         38.  Firstly, that is the only interpretation which can  be  placed
             on the unqualified determination by the CJEU in paragraph [33]
             of MG (Portugal) that "periods of imprisonment cannot be taken
             into  account  for  the  purposes  of  granting  the  enhanced
             protection provided  for  in  article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive
             2004/38", before the court went on to add  "and  in  principle
             such  periods  interrupt  the  continuity  of  the  period  of
             residence for the purposes of that provision".  If  the  Court
             had wanted to qualify the first part  of  the  paragraph  with
             "generally" or "usually" or "in principle" it could have  done
             so; but it did not.

         39.  Paragraphs [34] to [36] deal  with  the  question  of  whether
             periods of imprisonment  interrupt  continuity  of  residence,
             with paragraph [35] referring to "the non-continuous nature of
             the period of residence during the  ten  years  preceding  the
             decision to expel". I do  not  see  how  this  phraseology  is
             consistent  with  the  idea  that  time  in   custody   counts
             positively towards the ten years. It rather supports the  view
             that imprisonment presses a pause button. Mr Hafeez does  not,
             on any view, have a non-continuous period of residence in  the
             UK of ten years or more. Taking his claimed  arrival  date  of
             2006, at the time of the deportation decision he  had  between
             11- and 12-years continuous residence if the three and a  half
             years in custody count towards the total, but a non-continuous
             period of at most eight and a half years if they do not.

         40.   Secondly,  allowing   individuals   to   count   periods   of
             imprisonment  towards  the  ten  year  period  would   produce
             unjustifiable inconsistency between the tests  which  must  be
             satisfied to rely on the serious grounds or imperative grounds
             protections. As the CJEU made clear in Onuekwere  v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department (Case C-378/12) [2014] 1  WLR
             2420, a decision handed down on the same day and by  the  same
             panel as MG (Portugal), in calculating five years'  residence,
             periods before and after  time  spent  in  custody  cannot  be
             aggregated. It seems contrary to common sense that one day  in
             custody will reset the clock to zero and prevent an individual
             from relying on serious grounds protection, but  that  several
             years in custody can  be  used  positively  to  establish  ten
             years' residence and, subject to an  "overall  assessment"  of
             whether  continuity  has  in  fact  been  broken,  entitle  an
             individual to the imperative grounds protection

         41.  Thirdly, such a distinction would produce  arbitrary  results.
             This can be illustrated by two hypothetical  examples.  A  has
             resided in the United  Kingdom  for  11  years  prior  to  his
             deportation decision. He  has  spent  years  5-7  in  custody,
             pursuant to a six year sentence for rape passed on the  fourth
             anniversary of his arrival; so he only had two  sets  of  four
             years residence (either side of the  period  of  imprisonment)
             unblemished by imprisonment. He would not  have  acquired  the
             right of permanent residence  and  thus  has  neither  serious
             grounds protection nor imperative grounds protection.

         42.  B has also resided in the United Kingdom for 11 years prior to
             his deportation decision. He has spent years 7-9  in  custody,
             pursuant to a six year sentence for rape passed on  the  sixth
             anniversary of his arrival; which meant that prior to entering
             prison he had more than five years' residence  unblemished  by
             any period of imprisonment. If Ms Hirst  is  right,  he  would
             have a  right  of  permanent  residence  and,  subject  to  an
             assessment of whether his integrative links had  been  broken,
             would also be able to argue that he had ten years'  residence.
             Thus, despite residing in the  United  Kingdom  for  the  same
             number of years as A, and serving time in prison for the  same
             offence and the same number of years as A, B could be entitled
             to imperative grounds protection - two levels higher  than  A,
             who has only basic protection - simply because his  period  of
             custody commenced at a later stage.

         43.  For these reasons, I consider that the FTT judge was wrong  to
             give the Appellant the benefit of  the  legal  doubt  on  this
             point. As I said in Hussein at paragraph [18] (in  a  judgment
             handed down after the FTT and  UT  decisions  in  the  present
             case), an individual relying on imperative grounds  protection
             who has served time in custody must prove both that he has ten
             years' continuous (or non-continuous)  residence  ending  with
             the date of the decision on a mathematical basis and  that  he
             was sufficiently integrated within the host State during  that
             ten year period. In the present case, if the  Appellant  could
             not count his three and a half years  in  prison  towards  the
             necessary ten years'  residence,  he  failed  to  qualify  for
             imperative  grounds  protection  under  Regulation  27(4)  for
             simple mathematical  reasons.  The  question  of  whether  his
             integrative links with the UK were broken by the three  and  a
             half years in custody (as to which see Viscu, another decision
             of this court given after the FTT  and  UT  judgments  in  the
             present case) therefore does not arise.

         44.  The Appellant thus only had a right of permanent residence and
             accordingly  should  have  been   afforded   serious   grounds
             protection under Regulation 27(3), but not imperative  grounds
             protection under Regulation 27(4)".

41. The Appellant came to the United Kingdom in 2007.  Counting  back  from
    the decision to deport him he has resided here for 11 years.   However,
    the Appellant does not have ten years continuous residence ending  with
    the date  of  deportation  because  his  criminality  and  imprisonment
    interrupted continuity of residence.  In Hafeez  the  Court  of  Appeal
    decided that periods of imprisonment do not count towards  establishing
    ten years residence.  For simple mathematical reasons,  this  Appellant
    does not qualify for enhanced protection.

Is the Appellant's  deportation  justified  on  serious  grounds  of  public
policy?

42. The Appellant has permanent residence under the 2016 Regulations,  with
    the result that the tests in Regulations 27 (3)  and  27  (5)  must  be
    satisfied if the Secretary of State's deportation is to be upheld.  The
    burden of proving that a  person  represents  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
    society under Regulation 27(5)(c) rests on the Secretary of  State  and
    the  standard of proof is the balance  of  probabilities:  Arranz  (EEA
    Regulations - deportation - test) [2017] UKUT 294.

43. Regulation 27(5),  which  prevents  reliance  on  a  person's  criminal
    convictions "in themselves", reproduces the effect of the ruling of the
    European Court of Justice in Case 30/77 [1977]  ECR  1999  (Bouchereau)
    �28. The existence of a previous criminal  conviction  can,  therefore,
    only be taken into account in so far as the  circumstances  which  gave
    rise to that conviction are evidence of personal conduct constituting a
    present threat to the requirements of public  policy.  The  Appellant's
    criminal convictions form the context for an assessment of his  present
    threat to what is described  in  regulation  27(5)(c)  as  one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.

44. The decision to remove the Appellant must be based exclusively  on  his
    personal conduct. Matters that do not directly relate to the particular
    case or which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do  not
    justify a decision to remove him.  Deterrence  has  no  part  to  play.
    There is a need to look to the future. ( It is  not  the  Secretary  of
    State's case as advanced before  me  that  the  "Bouchereau"  exception
    applies) .

45. In Straszewski v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 1245, Moore - Blick LJ  said  the
    following about the test:

         "25.     In the present case  the  Secretary  of  State  sought  to
             justify Mr. Straszewski's deportation on  serious  grounds  of
             public policy or public security.  "Public policy"  for  these
             purposes  includes  the  policy  which  is  reflected  in  the
             interest of the state in protecting its citizens from  violent
             crime and the theft of their property.  These are  fundamental
             interests of society and therefore, although regulation  21(3)
             does not speak in terms of the risk of causing harm by  future
             offending, in a case of this kind that is the risk  which  the
             Secretary of State is called upon to assess  when  considering
             deportation. That requires an evaluation to  be  made  of  the
             likelihood that the person concerned  will  offend  again  and
             what the consequences  are  likely  to  be  if  he  does.   In
             addition, the need for the conduct of the person concerned  to
             represent a  "sufficiently  serious"  threat  to  one  of  the
             fundamental interests of society requires  the  decision-maker
             to balance the risk of future harm against the  need  to  give
             effect to the right of free movement.  In any  given  case  an
             evaluative exercise of that kind may admit of  more  than  one
             answer. If so, provided that all appropriate factors have been
             taken into account, the decision cannot be impugned unless  it
             is perverse or irrational, in the sense of falling outside the
             range of permissible decisions".

46. The offences committed by the Appellant are very serious. There  is  no
    good reason to go behind the sentencing judge's comments. The Appellant
    has not faced up to the nature of the offences relating  to  images  of
    children. In respect of the drug offences,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant is not a drug user. I am satisfied that at the  time  of  the
    offences he was estranged from his family. Having heard  evidence  from
    him and AM, I am satisfied  that  he  was  at  the  time  of  offending
    vulnerable, depressed and  lonely  following  the  break  down  of  his
    marriage.

47. The Secretary of State's case is that because  the  Appellant  has  not
    come to terms with his offences and is effectively in denial, there  is
    a risk of reoffending.  The sentencing judge's sentencing comments  and
    the  Appellant's  attitude  are  relied  on  to  support  this.    When
    sentencing the Appellant, the judge said that he  was  in  denial.  The
    judge did not agree with the author of the PSR who reached a  different
    conclusion. The sentencing judge said that the  Appellant  should  take
    the opportunity to address the fact that he is attracted  to  children.
    The Appellant has not done  this.   He  remains  in  denial.  While  he
    undertook courses in prison, they were not rehabilitative courses.

48. I did not have sight of the PSR. It is likely to have been prepared  by
    a probation officer following an assessment of the Appellant.  I  have,
    however, had the benefit of hearing the Appellant and AM give  evidence
    some four years after he was sentenced. I had the benefit of  an  OASys
    report in which the Appellant was assessed in 2018 as presenting a  low
    risk of re-offending.  I must assess risk at the date of the hearing.

49. I accept that generally denial increases the risk of  reoffending.   In
    MA the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  that
    the Appellant presented a risk for two  reasons,  the  gravity  of  the
    offence and the Appellant's denial of criminality.  In  that  case  the
    Upper Tribunal rejected the assessment of low risk in the OASys report.
    Mr Tufan drew my attention to what the court said about "low risk". The
    Court of Appeal considered "low-risk" in an OASys report in the context
    of a deportation of a foreign criminal under domestic  legislation  and
    the application of s72 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002  in  circumstances  where  the  gravity  of  the  offence  is   of
    significant materiality.  In this case, I accept the assessment in  the
    OASys report. Of course, low risk is not to be equated with no risk.  I
    make an assessment of risk, taking into account  all  material  matters
    including factors which would increase or  decrease  the  risk  of  re-
    offending. I also take into account the medium risk of harm should  the
    Appellant re-offend and  the  Appellant's  attitude  as  part  of  that
    assessment.

50. Having considered the evidence,  I  conclude  that  the  risk  of  this
    Appellant re-offending is low notwithstanding that he denies  having  a
    sexual interest in young children and that he has not received help  to
    address his offending.  I attach weight to the OASys assessment. I also
    take on board that the risk of harm to children is medium,  should  the
    Appellant reoffend. However, I have taken into account the  Appellant's
    fear  of  returning  to  prison  and  the  importance  to  him  of  his
    relationship with his son, N. Both came across  very  strongly  in  the
    evidence before me (and in the OASys report, p25 of 53). The risk of re-
    offending was assessed by the author of the report  in  2018  as  being
    low.  I find that the risk is less  now  than  it  was  in  2018.   The
    Appellant  does  not  have  any  other  convictions  and  his  personal
    circumstances have significantly changed.

51. There was no corroboration of the Appellant and AM's  evidence  that  N
    has autistic spectrum disorder. This was a  point  made  by  Mr  Tufan.
    However, there is no reason for me to not believe their evidence  about
    this. Both gave clear evidence about the child's problems. I found both
    witnesses to be credible. When assessing risk, N's  dependency  on  his
    father is material. This acts as a deterrent.

52. The Appellant is close to his  son  and  genuinely  concerned  for  his
    welfare in the event of his deportation. Discrepancy in the evidence of
    the Appellant and that of AM was more than likely as a  result  of  the
    time that has passed since they made their witness  statements.   Their
    oral evidence presented the picture at the  date  of  the  hearing.   I
    accept that at the date of the hearing the Appellant was seeing his son
    weekly.  I  accept  that  the  Appellant  gives  significant  financial
    support to his family, although the amount is not fixed which  explains
    discrepancies in the evidence on this issue.

53. In respect of the drugs matters, the Appellant conceded that he allowed
    his flat to be used to store drugs (there were two  co-defendants).  He
    pleaded guilty on the basis that he was  not  aware  that  cocaine  was
    stored.  He said in evidence that he was given cannabis in  return  for
    allowing his flat to be used by the co-defendants.  There  was  clearly
    an element of vulnerability as commented on by  the  sentencing  judge.
    The judge accepted that the Appellant was pressurised although this did
    not amount to duress. I am mindful that the defence of duress  is  very
    difficult to establish. The evidence very much supports  the  Appellant
    having had a  mental  breakdown  after  his  separation  having  become
    temporarily estranged from his family.   I am satisfied that  following
    a divorce the Appellant was depressed and vulnerable.

54. I have taken into account that the Appellant is permitted by the Social
    Services to have regular contact with his son, albeit supervised. It is
    not, however, supervised by a social worker. It is  supervised  by  his
    adult daughter.  I infer from this that the Social Service's view  that
    he does not present a threat to his family. There was  no  evidence  of
    the duration of supervised contact, but N is aged eighteen on his  next
    birthday. The evidence of AM was credible and persuasive. I accept that
    if she genuinely believed  that  the  Appellant  presented  a  risk  to
    children, she would not permit N to have contact with him.

55. I have no doubt in this case that the consequences of re-offending will
    act as a deterrent. What is  key  to  risk  of  reoffending  is  family
    support. The Appellant did not have this at the date the offences.   He
    now has a very strong connection with and support  from  AM  and  their
    children, particularly, N. He  is  employed  and  supports  the  family
    financially. Offending took place in the aftermath of  a  divorce  when
    the Appellant was estranged from his family.

56. While the  Appellant  committed  very  serious  offences,  taking  into
    account  all  the  evidence  and  having  conducted  a  fact   specific
    assessment of risk,  I  find  that  the  Secretary  of  State  has  not
    established that the  Appellant  represents  a  genuine,  present,  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society and that deportation is  justified  of  grounds  of  serious
    grounds of public policy.

57. I have not had to consider the  Appellant's  appeal  applying  domestic
    law. He is an EU national.  However,  following  the  United  Kingdom's
    withdrawal, if the Appellant re-offends  and  the  Secretary  of  State
    decides to make a deportation order, he will no longer be afforded  the
    benefit of EU law and any attempt to remain here will be more difficult
    for him.
