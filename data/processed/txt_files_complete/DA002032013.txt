For the Appellant:     Mr Ronan Daly, instructed by Gerard Maguire,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Andrew Mullen of the Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   On 16th January 2013 a decision was taken to deport  the  appellant,  a
    Portuguese national now aged 34, under regulation 19(3)(b) of  the  EEA
    Regulations 2006.  After residing in Northern Ireland for seven months,
    Mr Fafe had been arrested by the police in September 2011  and  charged
    with offences of  possessing  and  supplying  Class  A  drugs.   Having
    pleaded guilty, he was sentenced in October  2012  at  Craigavon  Crown
    Court to three years' imprisonment, for the second  half  of  which  he
    would normally be released on licence.  On 21st March 2013 an appeal to
    the First-tier Tribunal came before a panel comprising Judge Hutchinson
    and Dr Okitikpi, who dismissed the appeal.   Leave  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal was sought on the strength  of  grounds  which  asserted
    that  the  respondent  had  failed  to  observe  the  requirements   of
    regulation 21(5) and (6) of  the  EEA  Regulations  before  taking  the
    decision to expel an EEA national and,  without  condescending  to  any
    particulars, asserted that the panel had made the same errors  of  law.
    The respondent was then lambasted for not considering whether Mr Fafe's
    prospects of rehabilitation would be better in  this  country  than  in
    Portugal, as should have been done following Batiste,  Tsakouridis  and
    Essa.  The First-tier Tribunal was said to have made the same error  of
    law, but again it was not specified how.

2.    Such grounds would not ordinarily have found favour with a  First-tier
    judge considering 'leave applications', and the appellant was fortunate
    that Judge Bird took it upon herself to improve  upon  the  grounds  by
    identifying arguable flaws  in  the  determination  for  herself.   She
    complained that the panel had not considered whether Mr Fafe was likely
    to re-offend (there being no mention of an OASys Report), and  had  not
    taken into account  the  efforts  made  by  the  appellant  to  improve
    himself, as evidenced by a letter from the  Prison  Service  dated  8th
    March 2013.  The only notice taken of this letter  occurred,  according
    to Judge Bird, at paragraph 34 of the  determination,  when  the  panel
    simply observed that the appellant had not  obtained  accreditation  in
    any of the courses which he had attended while in prison.   Judge  Bird
    did note that the panel had considered rehabilitation at paragraphs 44-
    45 of the determination, but agreed with the grounds that the panel had
    arguably  failed  to  consider  properly  whether   deportation   would
    prejudice the prospects of the appellant's rehabilitation.

3.   Fortified by a grant of leave in such encouraging terms, the  appellant
    may well have thought it likely that the Upper Tribunal would find that
    errors of law had indeed been made, despite the features of the  First-
    tier determination pointed out by the  Specialist  Appeals  Team  in  a
    'Rule 24 Response'.  Indeed, when the appeal came before me  today,  Mr
    Fafe had the benefit of very determined and persuasive advocacy on  the
    part of Mr Daly, which Mr Mullen stoutly rebutted.   But  having  heard
    their submissions, it  was  clear  to  me  that  the  potential  errors
    identified in the grant of leave did not stand up  to  close  scrutiny,
    and that, although a different panel might  have  reached  a  different
    conclusion on the same facts, it could not be said that this panel  had
    committed an error of law.  A dictum of Carnwath LJ (as he was then) in
    Mukarkar [2006] EWCA Civ 1045 at paragraph 40 is pertinent here :

             "Factual judgments of this kind are often not easy,  but  they
         are not made easier or better  by  excessive  legal  or  linguistic
         analysis.  It is of the nature of  such  judgments  that  different
         tribunals, without illegality or irrationality, may reach different
         conclusions on the same case. ... The mere fact that  one  tribunal
         has reached what may seem an unusually generous view of  the  facts
         of a particular case does not mean that it has  made  an  error  of
         law, so as to justify an appeal ..."

4.   In the instant case, it could be said  that  the  panel  has  taken  an
    ungenerous view of the facts.  But it is not a view that was  not  open
    to them.  To begin with, their determination is very  well  structured,
    setting out the relevant information under appropriate headings,  until
    arriving at the 'Findings and Reasons' section.  They  first  calculate
    that the appellant is not entitled to the enhanced level of  protection
    from expulsion under European law that residence  in  the  host  Member
    State for five or ten years would have given him.  They take account of
    the Judge's sentencing remarks, with the points going in his favour  as
    well as against him, and then note the view taken in the  'Reasons  for
    Deportation' letter, derived from the Judge's remark that the appellant
    had taken to dealing in drugs when he found  himself  short  of  money,
    that the appellant might once again turn to crime if he  found  himself
    short of money.

5.   At paragraphs 21-22, the panel set out in  full  the  contents  of  the
    letter from the Prison Service dated 8th March 2013, listing Mr  Fafe's
    commendable achievements before being  released  on  licence,  although
    these did not include attaining accreditation in the  Art,  Guitar  and
    Computer classes which he attended.  Then follows the explanation given
    by the appellant in his Witness Statement of how  he  got  involved  in
    selling  drugs.   But  at  paragraphs  24-28  the  panel  examine  this
    explanation, and find that the  appellant  has  not  been  telling  the
    truth.  It cannot be said that their reasons for so  finding  were  not
    open to them.

6.   The panel go on to consider Mr Fafe's relationship with members of  his
    family, most of whom live in London.  They note that the appellant  did
    not turn to his family for help when he ran short of money in 2011, and
    that although his mother and sister have now moved to Northern Ireland,
    there are indications that their relationship to him is not as close as
    is made out.  For example, although in frequent contact over the phone,
    his mother did not find out that he had been arrested until  one  month
    later, and that was from another source.  His mother's evidence at  the
    hearing, that the appellant wanted to be an  interpreter,  contradicted
    the appellant's own evidence, that he would  look  for  a  job  in  IT,
    having got a certificate.   This  is  where  the  panel  observe  that,
    according to the letter from the Prison Service, the appellant did  not
    obtain accreditation in the Computer course which he attended, and that
    no certificates had been adduced.  This does not mean,  as  Judge  Bird
    thought, that the panel did not accept the evidence in  the  letter  of
    the appellant's efforts at self -improvement while in prison.

7.    The  panel  were  not  satisfied  that  his  family  would  act  as  a
    stabilising  influence  on  the  appellant.   That  may  seem  a  harsh
    conclusion, but it is not one that is not supported by any evidence  or
    reasons.  As for the appellant's job prospects, the  panel  note  that,
    while he expressed willingness to undertake any form of employment,  he
    did not obtain any employment during  the  seven  months  he  was  here
    before his arrest, and that he appeared at  best  undecided  about  his
    employment options.  This prognosis might seem gloomy, but again it  is
    not one that is unsupported by evidence.

8.   The panel go on to consider carefully all the conditions laid  down  by
    regulation 21(5) and (6), precedent to a  decision  to  expel  a  Union
    citizen.  They address a submission, repeated in the grounds of  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal, that the respondent's decision was based on  the
    appellant's previous criminal convictions alone, contrary to regulation
    21(5)(e).  They disagree, finding that the  respondent  considered  all
    the relevant circumstances, including the appellant's general  conduct.
    They agree with the respondent that there is a risk that the  appellant
    will re-offend, based on the fact that, as  the  Sentencing  Judge  had
    remarked, he had succumbed to the temptation of selling drugs  when  he
    was short of money.  The risk of his committing  such  offences  again,
    according to  the  panel,  would  represent  "a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society", in terms of regulation 21(5)(c).

9.   Contrary to what Judge Bird says about  the  panel  not  assessing  the
    risk of re-offending, the panel do explicitly do that here.   It  is  a
    harsh assessment, but it is  not  without  any  evidential  foundation.
    There does not appear to have been any OASys  Report  provided  in  the
    instant case.  There is  not  always  one.    When  that  happens,  the
    tribunal must do the best it can with what there  is,  as  happened  in
    both MK (Gambia) [2010] UKUT 281 (IAC) and BK (Ghana) [2010]  UKUT  328
    (IAC).

10.  That is not the end of the matter, for the panel go  on  at  paragraphs
    46-47 of the determination to look at the history of both the appellant
    and his family, and to take account of  his  good  behaviour  while  in
    prison and his attendance at Ad:ept  counselling.   Again,  this  shows
    Judge Bird to have been mistaken in supposing that the evidence of  the
    steps taken by the appellant to improve himself was not  considered  by
    the panel.  But having considered it, the panel conclude that it is  of
    limited value, because this behaviour was manifested in the  controlled
    environment of a prison.  There was no evidence that the appellant  had
    addressed his offending behaviour, given the panel's rejection  of  the
    appellant's own explanation of how he had come to be  involved  in  the
    offending behaviour.

11.  Again, I have to say that this is not a conclusion which a  differently
    constituted panel might have reached.  I  might  not  have  reached  it
    myself.  But my task is not to re-make the decision on the appeal,  but
    to decide whether the panel committed an error of law, such that  their
    determination has to be set aside.  One other matter is  complained  of
    in the grounds of appeal and in the grant of leave, namely the  panel's
    treatment of the rehabilitation issue.  At paragraphs 44-45  they  cite
    Batiste (the name is actually  Batista)  for  the  enunciation  of  the
    principle, and then express the view that  the  appellant's  links  and
    integration in the UK are tenuous at best, and that the presence of his
    family here will not have the rehabilitative  effect  claimed  for  it.
    They acknowledge that the appellant  would  have  the  benefit  of  his
    licence conditions and a Probation Officer if he were to  remain  here,
    advantages which he would not have in Portugal.  Nevertheless, they are
    not satisfied that this disadvantage outweighs the factors in favour of
    deportation.

12.  Absent perversity, matters of weight  are  not  matters  of  law.   The
    panel have concluded that the appellant's prospects  of  rehabilitation
    would be better in this country than in Portugal,  and  if  it  were  a
    tenet of European law that a Union citizen cannot be  expelled  if  his
    prospects of rehabilitation are better in the host Member  State,  then
    the panel would have committed an error of  law.   But  they  are  only
    required to weigh the prospects of rehabilitation in the balance, along
    with everything else.  That is what they have done.  Much  will  depend
    on the individual facts of the particular case.   In  Tsakouridis,  for
    example, the claimant had been  resident  in  Germany  for  many  years
    before being sentenced to 6� years' imprisonment  for  drug  smuggling.
    Mr Fafe had only resided in Northern Ireland for seven months before he
    was arrested for drug-dealing.

13.  The panel's finding on Article 8  has  not  been  challenged,  and  the
    outcome of this appeal against the  First-tier  determination  must  be
    that it does not succeed.


     DECISION

     The appeal is dismissed.
