For the Appellant:     Mr S Muquit of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Mangion, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal with permission against a  decision  by  Judge  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal Kempton dismissing this appeal under Article 8 of the
   Human Rights Convention.

2)  The  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  described   the   appellant's
   immigration history as "checkered".  In August  2011  the  appellant  was
   successful in an appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  against  a  decision  to
   deport him.  His success was based on his relationship with his son,  JK,
   now aged 4, together with his relationship with his wife, SB.   Following
   this appeal the appellant was given discretionary leave to  remain  until
   10 July 2012.  On 4 July 2010 he applied for further leave but  this  was
   refused and reasons for the refusal were  given  in  a  letter  dated  31
   January 2013.  The reasons for refusal letter was accompanied by a notice
   dated 30 January 2013 entitled "Notice of  Refusal  of  Leave  to  Enter"
   purporting to contain a decision to  remove  the  appellant.   With  some
   justification, perhaps, the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not seem
   clear about the nature of the decision under appeal.  The  judge  pointed
   out that the refusal letter incorrectly  referred  to  the  appellant  as
   still subject  to  a  deportation  order  (notwithstanding  his  previous
   successful appeal) and it may  be  this  misapprehension  which  led  the
   respondent to make a decision in the form in which it was made.

3) In the present appeal the Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  recognised
   that family life had previously been found to exist between the appellant
   and his wife and children.  The appellant now has a second son, JA,  aged
   22 months.

4) The Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  noted  that  not  only  were  the
   appellant and his wife no longer  residing  together  but  an  order  for
   protection from harassment was made at  Newcastle  Magistrates  Court  in
   August 2012 prohibiting the appellant from contacting  his  wife  by  any
   means whatsoever,  with  the  exception  of  contact  with  the  children
   arranged through his solicitors.

5) Both the appellant and his wife appeared before the  First-tier  Tribunal
   to give evidence.  No witness statement was provided in  respect  of  the
   appellant's wife.  She explained the circumstances leading to  the  order
   for protection from harassment.  This followed an  argument  between  the
   appellant and his wife in a night club after they had both been drinking.
    Each thought the other was looking after the children  at  home.   As  a
   result of this argument the appellant  was  arrested.   The  court  order
   against him was lifted 6-8 weeks prior to the hearing before  the  First-
   tier Tribunal.  There were, however, photographs of  the  appellant  with
   the children around Christmas 2012.

6) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  inferred  from  the  absence  of  a
   witness statement from the appellant's wife that there may have been some
   difficulty "either in contacting her or perhaps some  reluctance  on  her
   part" in assisting the appellant.  The judge  noted  that  there  was  no
   evidence from Victim Support or any other official organisation, such  as
   social services, in relation to the state of  the  relationship  and  the
   best interests of the children.  The judge was  not  satisfied  that  the
   evidence of the appellant and his wife could be taken at face  value  and
   that their relationship was subsisting.  Because of  this  it  seems  the
   judge was not satisfied that it was in the best interests of the children
   for the appellant to succeed.  The judge further noted that the appellant
   was facing a trial on criminal  charges  and  this  weighed  against  the
   appellant under Article 8.

Submissions

7) When addressing me at  the  hearing,  Mr  Muquit  acknowledged  that  the
   grounds of the application for permission to appeal were not  as  clearly
   drafted as they might have been.  He said there  were  essentially  three
   grounds.  The first was that the judge erred  in  finding  there  was  no
   family life.  The judge's approach to the evidence was unfair  especially
   in relation to the absence of a witness statement  from  the  appellant's
   wife, on the basis of which the judge rejected her evidence as lacking in
   credibility.

8) The second ground related to the best interests of the  children.   There
   was a manifest error  in  the  determination  over  what  were  the  best
   interests of the children and the judge had  not  approached  their  best
   interests as a primary consideration.

9) Mr Muquit continued that, thirdly,  the  judge  had  taken  into  account
   irrelevant matters in relation to proportionality  under  Article  8,  in
   particular outstanding charges against the  appellant  on  which  he  had
   still to be tried.

10) Mr  Muquit  pointed  out  that  when  the  appellant's  previous  appeal
   succeeded, his relationship with his wife was  described  as  "volatile".
   He made his application for further leave to remain in time  but  it  was
   refused.  The refusal letter itself was confused and referred erroneously
   to a deportation order having been made.  It also erroneously applied the
   new Immigration Rules.  Nevertheless the  refusal  letter  accepted  that
   there was family life  between  the  appellant  and  his  children.   The
   protection  from  harassment  order  did  not  address  the   appellant's
   relationship with his children.  Although there was no  statement  before
   the First-tier Tribunal from the appellant's wife, she did attend to give
   evidence.  Her evidence was that the couple were still  living  together.
   During a lengthy cross-examination  there  was  no  suggestion  that  the
   appellant's wife was coerced into giving evidence.   Although  the  order
   made by the Magistrates Court prevented the appellant from coming  within
   100 yards of his wife, this only  applied  where  he  did  not  have  the
   permission or acquiescence of his wife.  It should be  presumed  that  it
   was in the best interests of the  children  to  have  contact  with  both
   parents.  The appellant continued to pay nursery fees in respect  of  the
   children.

11) Mr Muquit submitted that the judge gave inadequate reasons  for  finding
   there was no family life.  The judge did not give  adequate  reasons  for
   saying she was not satisfied by the evidence of  the  appellant  and  his
   wife that family life was continuing.  In its decision the Upper Tribunal
   had applied ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4.  At that time the appellant  had
   only one child but he had a strong bond with his son.  Before  the  Upper
   Tribunal there was  no  evidence  from  social  services  and  the  Upper
   Tribunal Judge recognised that the absence of that  evidence  showed  the
   relationship was continuing as social services would intervene only where
   there was a problem.  The authorities showed  that  family  life  between
   parent and child was presumed, as in EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL  41.   There
   was no suggestion that the appellant presented any risk to the  children.
   He was paying ï¿½25 per week for the nursery and there was no evaluation of
   what would happen to this if the appellant was removed.

12) Mr Muquit submitted that the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  accepted
   that there  was  family  life  before  2011  but  did  not  say  why  the
   relationship  with  the  children  had  broken  down.    There   was   no
   justification for her finding that there was no family life  between  the
   appellant and his children.  The appellant had  given  evidence  on  this
   himself and no corroboration was  required.   In  her  determination  the
   judge confused the existence of family life  with  questions  as  to  the
   quality of family life.

13) In relation to proportionality, Mr Muquit submitted that  there  was  no
   deportation  order  and  this  affected  the  assessment  of  the  public
   interest.  The judge had not taken into  account  the  interests  of  the
   children as a primary consideration in the balancing exercise.

14) For the respondent Mr Mangion  submitted  that  the  central  issue  was
   whether undue weight had been given to the restraining order.  The  order
   had been lifted and the judge had accepted this.  The judge also accepted
   evidence of diminished cohabitation.  The  evidence  of  the  appellant's
   wife was that the appellant spends a fifth of his time  away  from  home.
   The quality of the appellant's relationship with his wife  would  have  a
   knock-on effect on the best interests of the children.  The judge was not
   satisfied as to the quality of  the  appellant's  relationship  with  the
   children.  There was a question as to whether the judge was  entitled  to
   draw an inference from  the  absence  of  a  witness  statement  and  the
   existence of the restraining order.  In relation to  proportionality  the
   judge was entitled to take into account allegations against the appellant
   even though they were unproven.

Discussion

15) It is unfortunate that both in the determination by  the  Judge  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal and in the application for permission to appeal there
   is considerable discussion of the nature of the relationship between  the
   appellant and his wife  whereas  the  focus,  certainly  in  the  judge's
   determination, should have been on the relationship between the appellant
   and his children.  The judge may have been entitled to draw the inference
   she did about the relationship between the appellant and his  wife.   She
   was not entitled, however, without more, to use her  findings  about  the
   relationship between the appellant and  his  wife  as  the  basis  for  a
   finding that it was not in the best interests of  the  children  for  the
   appellant to have continuing contact with them in  this  country.   Given
   the ages of the children and the previous findings made in respect of the
   first child by the Upper Tribunal, a finding that it  was  not  in  their
   best interests for the appellant to continue to have direct contact  with
   them would require strong and substantial reasoning.  There  is  no  such
   reasoning in this determination.  The judge's reasoning  in  relation  to
   the best interests of the children is weak almost to the  point  of  non-
   existence.  Furthermore, as Mr Muquit pointed out, she does not appear to
   have  regarded  the  best  interests  of  the  children  as   a   primary
   consideration.  The inadequacy  of  reasoning  in  respect  of  the  best
   interests of the children amounts to an error of law because of which the
   judge's decision must be set aside.

16) I have considered whether this decision  should  be  remade  within  the
   Upper Tribunal.  However, there is an almost  complete  absence  of  fact
   finding by the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal as to the best  interests
   of the children and  as  to  the  evidence  relating  to  their  welfare.
   Accordingly, I consider the appropriate course is for the  appeal  to  be
   remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to  be  reheard  before  a  different
   judge in order, in  particular,  that  facts  may  be  found  as  to  the
   children's relationship with their  father  and  as  to  where  the  best
   interests of the children rely, as well  as  in  relation  to  the  other
   issues in dispute under Article 8.  I make this  decision  in  accordance
   with Practice Statement 7.2(b).

17) There is a further issue to be decided in relation to the scope for  the
   application of the new Immigration Rules, which came into force on 9 July
   2012.  In the reasons for refusal letter the respondent  considered  that
   these rules applied to this application.  The judge decided otherwise but
   does not appear to have had any regard to the transitional provisions  in
   paragraph 91 of HC194 or  to  the  nature  of  the  immigration  decision
   against  which  the  appeal  was  brought.   Indeed,  the  form  of   the
   immigration decision itself presents something of a conundrum, which  may
   even have implications for jurisdiction.  As I have not heard submissions
   on these matters I do not intend to decide them at this  stage  but  they
   are matters which will need to be considered when the appeal  is  reheard
   before the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions

18) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error  on  a  point
   of law such that it is set aside and will be remade at a  hearing  before
   the First-tier Tribunal.

Anonymity

19) Although the First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to  Rule
   45(4)(i) of the Asylum & Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005,  I
   consider that because the evidence concerns family  life  involving   two
   young children such an order should be made in terms of Rule  14  of  the
   Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  The appellant is granted
   anonymity, unless and until a Tribunal or court  directs  otherwise.   No
   report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or
   any member of his family.  This direction applies both to  the  appellant
   and to the respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could  lead
   to contempt of court proceedings.
