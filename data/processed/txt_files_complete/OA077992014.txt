                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
           granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  on  18  May  2015
           against the decision and reasons of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
           O'Garro who had allowed the  Respondents'  appeals  against  the
           Entry Clearance Officer's decisions dated 4  May  2013,  17  May
           2013 and 17 May 2013 to refuse to grant the Respondents leave to
           enter  the  United  Kingdom  for  settlement  as  a  spouse  and
           dependant children under Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules.
           The decision and reasons was promulgated on 18 March 2015.


      2.    The Respondents are nationals of Lebanon and their  appeals  are
           linked.  Their relationship to their sponsor was  accepted.   On
           review  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  on  25  April  2014,
           following service of the Notices of Appeal, the availability  of
           suitable accommodation was conceded on the basis of the  further
           evidence provided.  The refusal as to the financial requirements
           was, however, maintained.  The Entry Clearance Officer had noted
           that the sponsor had to prove a gross income of at least �24,800
           per annum, but had not provided the specified documents set  out
           in Appendix FM-SE.  The application was refused under  paragraph
           EC-P.1.1(d) of the Immigration Rules.   No  additional  evidence
           had been  provided  and  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager,  having
           considered  evidential   flexibility,   decided   it   was   not
           appropriate to exercise his discretion.   The  inconsistency  in
           how the sponsor was paid cast doubt on his actual earnings.  The
           end of year certificate from HMRC with the Notices of Appeal did
           not confirm that the income threshold had been reached and there
           was  no  confirmation  from  the  employer  of   the   sponsor's
           employment or earnings.


      3.    Judge O'Garro allowed the linked appeals under  the  Immigration
           Rules, finding  that  there  was  no  real  discrepancy  in  the
           sponsor's income and that the sponsor had met Appendix FM.   The
           judge did not address Appendix FM-SE in specific terms  and  its
           requirements that the specified documents must be produced  with
           the application(s).  At [26]  of  her  determination  the  judge
           stated that she found that the employer's letter,  although  not
           produced with the application(s), was evidence  appertaining  to
           the date of the decision(s) and  was  admissible  under  section
           85(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   The
           judge also found that the Entry Clearance  Manager  should  have
           used his discretion differently: see [29] of the determination.
       4.   Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  as  sought  by  the
           Appellant was granted by Judge Parkes because he considered that
           it was arguable  that  the  judge  had  failed  to  address  the
           requirements of Appendix FM-SE as the  cash  payments  were  not
           reflected separately in the wage slips and that  the  judge  had
           been mistaken with regard to the employment letter.


      5.    Standard directions were made by the Upper Tribunal.




      Submissions - error of law


      6.    Mr Tufan for the Secretary of State submitted that  this  was  a
           clear case of legal error, as the grant of permission to  appeal
           by the First-tier Tribunal indicated. The  judge  had  evidently
           misconstrued Appendix FM-SE and was wrong  to  have  interpreted
           section 85(5) in the way she had.  The decision  should  be  set
           aside and remade, dismissing the appeals.


      7.    Ms Simpson for the Respondents submitted that the section  85(5)
           point was only a part of the appeals and that the judge  had  in
           any event been right in finding that the discretion in  Appendix
           FM-SE should have been exercised in the Respondents' favour.  It
           had been unreasonable of the Entry Clearance Manager not to have
           asked  for  further  information,  especially  as  the  evidence
           pointed to the  sponsor's  ability  to  meet  the  threshold  of
           �24,800.  In fact the  evidence  as  a  whole  showed  that  the
           sponsor's income was closer to �30,000 and so even if  the  cash
           payments of wages were entirely discounted there was  enough  to
           exceed the threshold.  This was the  substance  of  the  judge's
           determination, which should be upheld.


      8.    In reply, Mr Tufan pointed out that the  employer's  letter  was
           not produced until the hearing.  Significantly, it had not  been
           produced with  the  Notice  of  Appeal,  unlike  the  additional
           material on accommodation which the Entry Clearance Manager  had
           accepted and thus conceded was now met.    The  Entry  Clearance
           Manager's exercise of discretion was reasonable  and  the  judge
           had been wrong to find otherwise.  The Respondents had  been  on
           clear notice from the Entry Clearance Officer's  decisions  what
           they needed to address.






      The error of law finding


      9.    At the conclusion of  submissions,  the  tribunal  reserved  its
           determination which now  follows.   The  tribunal  should  never
           hurry to interfere with the decision of an experienced judge and
           it is with reluctance that the tribunal  finds  that  the  judge
           materially  erred  on  this  occasion.   The  determination  was
           carefully prepared and the judge quite understandably considered
           the merits were in the Respondents' favour.  Nevertheless,  such
           appeals are not determined on their broader merits but rather on
           compliance with the strict provisions of the Immigration  Rules.
           These are not once for all decisions as the prospect of a  fresh
           application is  nearly  always  available.  There  were  in  the
           tribunal's view two material errors of law, the first leading to
           the second.


      10.   The judge's construction of section 85(5)  of  the  Nationality,
           Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 so far as that  section  was  in
           force as at the date of decision  (a  new  version  applies  for
           decisions taken after 20 October 2014, subject  to  transitional
           provisions) was unfortunately mistaken when  considered  against
           the mandatory requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  Appendix FM-SE.D.
           (which the judge helpfully set out at [27] of her determination)
           states in express terms that the decision  maker  will  consider
           documents that have been submitted  with  the  application,  and
           will only consider post application  documents  under  specified
           circumstances.  Thus post application  evidence  could  only  be
           considered on a discretionary basis if the conditions laid  down
           in subparagraphs D.(b) or D.(e) were met, i.e., a  document  was
           missing from a sequence, was in the wrong format, was a copy not
           an original or did not contain all of the specified information,
           or there was a valid  reason  why  the  document  could  not  be
           supplied, e.g., was never issued or was permanently lost.


      11.   That was plainly not the case with the  employer's  letter.   As
           the judge noted, it was not produced until the hearing.  Had  it
           been produced with the notice(s) of appeal, then  (as  Mr  Tufan
           submitted), the Entry Clearance Manager might well have had good
           reason to exercise discretion in the Respondents' favour.   That
           he was open-minded and conscious of the fair performance of  his
           responsibilities was amply demonstrated by  his  willingness  to
           concede the  accommodation  point  in  the  face  of  the  fresh
           evidence provided.


      12.   Ms Simpson with her  customary  skill  sought  to  persuade  the
           tribunal that the Entry Clearance Manager had missed the  point,
           accepted by the judge, that the required figure of  �24,800  had
           been met in any event.  But that was the second  material  error
           of law the judge made.  The employer's letter  was  a  mandatory
           requirement of Appendix FM-SE, and had to be provided  with  the
           application, for the obvious reason that its veracity  could  be
           checked if needed.  The Notice of Appeal was the last  practical
           opportunity for that to happen.  The process of refusal overseas
           requires that the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  reviews  an  Entry
           Clearance Officer's refusal decision  before  a  final  decision
           either way is made.  That process is mandatory.


      13.   In the tribunal's view, the Entry Clearance  Manager's  decision
           not to use his discretion  in  the  Respondents'  favour  was  a
           perfectly reasonable one on the applications as  they  stood  in
           the light of service of the Notices of Appeal and the additional
           evidence then produced.  The Respondents had had the opportunity
           to comply with the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE,  belatedly.
           They were on  the  clearest  notice  of  their  omissions.   The
           discrepancies identified by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and
           Entry Clearance Manager called into question the actual earnings
           of the sponsor.  It was not for the Entry Clearance  Officer  or
           Entry Clearance Manager to discount  elements  of  the  evidence
           provided, because the burden of proof of compliance was  on  the
           Respondents.  The P60 produced with the Notices  of  Appeal  did
           not resolve the discrepancies.  In the tribunal's view the judge
           was wrong to have considered that the discretion provided  under
           Appendix FM-SE even  arose  on  the  facts  found,  because  the
           necessary conditions had not been  met.   No  valid  reason  was
           given for the failure to produce the sponsor's employer's letter
           with the entry clearance applications.


      14.   It follows that the tribunal upholds the  Secretary  of  State's
           appeal.   The  tribunal  accordingly  sets  aside  the   judge's
           determination.


       The fresh decision


      15.   For clarity the tribunal will now refer to the parties by  their
           designations in the First-tier Tribunal.   No  further  evidence
           was required  as  the  Appellants  had  to  have  submitted  the
           specified  evidence  at  the  time  of  their  entry   clearance
           applications.  The tribunal finds that  the  specified  evidence
           was incomplete.   As noted already, the tribunal finds  that  no
           valid reason was given for the failure to produce the  sponsor's
           employer's letter  with  the  entry  clearance  applications  or
           indeed  with  the  Notices  of  Appeal  at  latest.   The  Entry
           Clearance  Manager  was  aware  of  the  Secretary  of   State's
           discretion effectively vested in him and gave proper reasons for
           not exercising that discretion,  above  all  for  the  practical
           reason that no such document had been produced to him.   He thus
           had no reason to suspect that it existed or could be obtained.


      16.   There was no  suggestion  that  the  Appellants  are  not  in  a
           position  to  submit  fresh  and   compliant   entry   clearance
           applications.  No  evidence  of  exceptional  circumstances  was
           shown.  The Appellants and their sponsor  failed  to  show  that
           they are unable to live as a family in other places  apart  from
           the United Kingdom.  Thus, however the Appellants'  appeals  are
           analysed, they must fail.


      17.   There was no application for  an  anonymity  direction  and  the
           tribunal sees no need for one.


      DECISION


      The making of the previous decision involved the making  of  an  error
on    a point of law.  The tribunal allows the onwards appeals to the  Upper
      Tribunal, sets aside the original decisions and remakes  the  original
decisions as follows:

      The appeals are dismissed

      Signed                                 Dated
