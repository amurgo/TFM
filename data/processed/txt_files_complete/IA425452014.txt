                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



    1. The claimant is a citizen of India born on  12th  October  1985.  He
       arrived in the UK on 5th November 2009 with leave to enter as a Tier
       4 general student. This leave was extended until 16th  August  2014.
       On 4th July 2014 he made an application to remain further as a  Tier
       4 student migrant but this application was refused without  a  right
       of appeal on 3rd October 2014, however in fact on 7th July  2014  he
       varied his application so that he applied for leave to remain as the
       dependent of his wife who had (and continues to  have)  leave  under
       the points based system as a Tier 4 student migrant. This  dependent
       application was refused on human rights grounds by the Secretary  of
       State on 14th October 2014: it was said he did not qualify for leave
       either on the basis of his private life under  paragraph  276ADE  of
       the Immigration Rules or under Appendix FM as a partner  because  he
       had sought leave by deception and so was not  "suitable"  under  the
       Immigration Rules. His appeal against the decision was: "allowed  on
       human rights grounds allowed under the Immigration Rules" by  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Haria in a determination promulgated on the 11th
       June 2015.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Grimmett on 21st September 2015 on the basis that  it  was  arguable
       that the First-tier judge had erred in law in failing  to  refer  to
       the specific evidence of deception relating to the claimant and  the
       evidence of Mr Sartorius, and just referring to generic evidence  in
       his findings. It was also found to be arguable that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal  had  failed  to   consider   whether   it   would   be   a
       disproportionate interference with the right to respect  for  family
       life for the claimant and his wife to be separated for  the  last  3
       months of her leave as a student.

    3. The matter came before Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Baird  on  18th
       November 2015 when she decided  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
       erred in law and set aside the decision in its entirety.

    4. The matter came before me pursuant to a transfer order to remake the
       appeal. Directions were given by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Murray
       on 5th May 2016 that the voice sample tapes used by TOEIC were to be
       served on the claimant by the Secretary of State 14  days  prior  to
       the next hearing or alternatively it was to be communicated if  this
       was not possible. This  direction  was  not  complied  with  by  the
       Secretary of State.

    5. A number of preliminary matters arose at the hearing.

    6. Firstly I enquired whether the direction above was  pursued  in  any
       way. Mr Tarlow said his understanding was that the tapes  could  not
       be obtained.  Mr Sharma pointed out that from paragraph 22 of SM and
       Qadir v SSHD (ETS- Evidence-Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229  that
       in the context of  "judicial  compulsion"  ETS  might  supply  voice
       recordings if requested to do so by the Secretary of State.  However
       he did not wish to delay proceedings by pursuing the application for
       the tapes.

    7. Secondly Mr Sharma raised a serious allegation that Mr Kandola,  who
       had been the Secretary of State's representative  at  the  last  CMR
       hearing, had mislead the Tribunal. He had told the Tribunal that the
       expert report of Professor Peter French dated 20th  April  2016  had
       been served on the claimant's solicitors, and this was then  put  in
       writing by the Upper Tribunal to  the  claimant's  solicitors  in  a
       notice dated 3rd May 2016. At the CMR hearing  before  Deputy  Upper
       Tribunal Judge Murray Mr Kandola had then said that it  had  not  in
       fact been served until the day of that hearing (the 5th  May  2016).
       Mr Kandola said that this was because he had been  corresponding  by
       email and could  not  serve  the  claimant's  solicitors  by  email.
       However there was an  email  address  for  correspondence  on  Hiren
       Patel's letter head which had  been  used  to  correspond  with  the
       Secretary of State. This was therefore also untrue. Mr Sharma argued
       that in the context of this "bad  faith"  I  should  not  admit  the
       report of Professor French. He said that Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge
       Murray had left this issue to be decided at the full hearing when it
       was raised at the CMR. Mr Tarlow submitted it was in  the  interests
       of  justice  to  admit  the  report,  and  he  would  have  to  take
       instructions from Mr Kandola regarding the allegations of bad faith,
       and did not know if he was in the building.  My decision was that  I
       could not exclude the report of Professor French on the basis of bad
       faith without giving Mr  Kandola  the  opportunity  to  explain  his
       statements  and  actions  to  the  Tribunal.  This  would  therefore
       necessitate an adjournment of the hearing. Mr Sharma said  in  these
       circumstances he preferred that the report be admitted,  as  he  did
       not wish the proceedings to be adjourned.

    8. Thirdly Mr  Sharma  questioned  whether  the  Secretary  of  State's
       evidence in the statements of Ms R Collings and Mr P Millington  had
       been served on the claimant and First-tier Tribunal. The notes of Ms
       M Afzali, home office presenting officer, and notes in the  Tribunal
       file indicated that they were, and Mr Sharma accepted that this  had
       been properly done.

    9. Fourthly Mr Sharma argued that the decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal
       Judge Baird, finding that the First-tier Tribunal judge erred in law
       and that their decision  should  be  set  aside  with  no  preserved
       findings of fact, ought to be reviewed  and  set  aside  by  me.  He
       pointed out that in the concluding paragraph 13 of the  decision  on
       error of law Judge Baird had said that it was  "arguable"  that  the
       decision that the claimant had used deception was unlawful. This was
       the test for a grant of permission to appeal and not for  a  finding
       that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law. There was a one  hour
       adjournment for the parties  and  myself  to  consider  this  matter
       further.

   10.  I  decided  that  whilst  s.10(4)  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
       Enforcement Act 2007 provided a power to review a  decision  of  the
       Upper Tribunal and set it aside that this power was limited  by  the
       Tribunal Procedure Rules in accordance with s.10(3) of the 2007 Act.
       In  accordance  with  Rule  46  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
       Tribunal)  Rules  2008  this  power   could  only  be  exercised  in
       accordance with Rule 45(1), and thus  only  in  the  context  of  an
       application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal  against
       a decision of the Upper Tribunal.  Mr Sharma indicated that  in  his
       view this might not be correct, relying upon  Patel  v  SSHD  [2015]
       EWCA Civ 1175, but that he did not wish to  pursue  the  matter  and
       accepted that the Tribunal should now go on  to  simply  remake  the
       appeal.



Evidence & Submissions - Remaking

   11. The claimant attended  the  Tribunal  and  gave  oral  evidence.  He
       confirmed his identity, and adopted his witness statement confirming
       that it was true and correct.

   12. In this statement and in oral evidence (given in  response  both  to
       examination  in  chief  and  cross-examination),  in  summary,   the
       claimant states as follows. He came to the UK in November 2009 as  a
       Tier 4 general student migrant and have leave in that capacity valid
       until 16th August 2014. He married Mrs  Rizwana  Razak  Samnani  who
       had, and has, leave as a Tier 4 student migrant. At  that  time  she
       was studying for a Master's degree (NQF level 7) at  the  University
       of Ulster, a course which had a duration of over 12 months. He  made
       an application to remain as her dependent on 7th July 2014.  He  was
       refused on 14th October 2014 for reasons that he says are wrong.

   13. The claimant  says  he  did  not  use  deception  to  take  his  ETS
       examinations, and the Secretary of State has provided no evidence to
       him that he had done so. He had taken his ETS tests  at  the  London
       College of Social Studies on 21st March  2012.  He  had  found  this
       college via the internet and chose it as it  could  offer  an  early
       date for the tests, in the context of his having  only  45  days  to
       make a new student application following revocation of  the  licence
       of his previous college. On  arrival  he  had  given  his  name  and
       address, and provided a copy of his  passport  (the  original  being
       with the Secretary of State). The test consisted of  the  following.
       He introduced himself. He had to read some  text  from  a  piece  of
       paper. He was then asked  some  questions  about  himself  which  he
       answered. He was then shown a picture and asked to describe what was
       in the picture for 2 or 3 minutes. He was then given a topic,  asked
       his opinion on this topic and been asked to talk for 3 or 4  minutes
       on the topic. In  total  the  test  lasted  15  to  20  minutes.  He
       understood the test was recorded as there was a red  button  on  the
       table which was pressed. He contended he had taken the speaking test
       himself and not, as the Secretary of State, maintained via a  proxy.
       He had received his test results 12  working  days  later  by  post,
       having been told it would be between 10 and 15 working  days  later.
       He scored 170 out of 200 in this speaking test. On the same  day  he
       had also taken a writing test. He had also had to take  a  listening
       and reading test on another date. He had passed all sections of  the
       test. He had first been informed about the allegation of cheating by
       the Secretary of State in the refusal letter of 14th  October  2014.
       He asked his solicitors to  contact  ETS  about  the  allegation  of
       cheating, but did not do so himself as he did not know how to do so.
       He understood the solicitors had  some  correspondence  relating  to
       this in which ETS had refused to provide further details,  which  Mr
       Sharma then handed to Mr Tarlow and to the Tribunal. By the time  he
       was refused the London College of Social  Studies  had  been  closed
       down and had its licence suspended so he could  obtain  no  evidence
       from them.

   14. The claimant says he had always abided  by  the  conditions  of  his
       leave and undertook to abide by the Immigration Rules in the future.



   15. The claimant explained that his wife has been studying for a MSc  in
       accounting and finance at Kingston University (NQF  level  7)  since
       September  or  October  2015,  and  will  finish  those  studies  in
       September 2016, and has leave to remain  as  a  student  until  13th
       January 2017. He argues his appeal should be allowed.

   16. Mr Tarlow submitted that he relied  upon  the  reasons  for  refusal
       letter. This letter refuses the applicant as if he  had  applied  to
       remain in the UK on the basis of his family and private  life  under
       paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules and Appendix FM,  although
       this is not the application the claimant  made  in  his  application
       dated 4th July 2014 (which was to remain as a  points  based  system
       dependent spouse), or at any point. In summary the letter  says  the
       claimant is not entitled to remain as he cannot meet the suitability
       requirements of the Immigration Rules as  he  has  sought  leave  to
       remain in the UK by deception by submitting  a  English  certificate
       obtained by using a proxy test taker to take the speaking  component
       of his TOEIC English language test. This  contention  was  based  on
       information provided  to  the  Secretary  of  State  by  Educational
       Testing Service (ETS). In addition the claimant could not  meet  the
       other requirements of  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
       Immigration Rules. It was however accepted  that  he  was  genuinely
       married to Rizwana Razak Samnani who is an  Indian  citizen  with  a
       valid student  visa,  which  at  that  time  was  valid  until  29th
       September 2015.  Consideration  was  given  to  the  application  on
       Article 8 ECHR grounds outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules  but  no
       exceptional circumstances were found warranting a grant of leave  on
       that basis.

   17. Mr Tarlow declined to make any submissions regarding the  claimant's
       ability to  meet  the  Immigration  Rules  at  paragraph  319C,  the
       relevant paragraph for points based system  dependent  spouses,  and
       said he left that matter in  the  hands  of  the  Tribunal.  He  did
       however add that the report of  Professor  French  showed  that  the
       number of "false positives" likely in ETS's  system  of  identifying
       proxy test takers was likely to be much lower than that estimated by
       Dr Harrison because of the intervention of linguistic experts.  This
       meant that SM and Qadir should not be followed as the  Secretary  of
       State now had stronger evidence which satisfied the burden of  proof
       that the claimant had used deception.

   18. Mr Sharma submitted, in summary, as follows. The starting point  was
       SM and Qadir. The evidence before this Tribunal was the same  as  in
       SM and Qadir with the addition of the report  of  Professor  French.
       The evidence  of  the  Secretary  of  State  in  SM  and  Qadir  was
       characterised as having "paled and wilted" once that of Dr  Harrison
       was considered. Most notable was the fact that there was no evidence
       from ETS themselves before the Tribunal. The evidence in this  case,
       as in SM and Qadir, was all in the form  of  statements  and  spread
       sheets compiled by the Secretary of State. The  Secretary  of  State
       must have had some evidence from ETS to make the  spread  sheet  but
       had chosen not to release this to the  Tribunal.  It  was  submitted
       that the Secretary of State could not lawfully delegate  a  decision
       of deception to ETS, and had not discharged her burden of proof.

   19. The report of Professor French does not  advance  the  Secretary  of
       State's case significantly. It had significant frailties. It  relies
       upon information provided to the Secretary of State by  ETS  in  the
       form of questions and answers but does not exhibit  these  questions
       and answers to the report. It has not been possible  to  respond  to
       this report as an adjournment to do this was previously refused.

   20. In relation to the issue of false  positives  the  Professor  French
       report concedes that there will  have  been  false  positives  (para
       3.2). It is clear ETS holds no data on the quality of the  sound  on
       the recordings (para 3.2.3).It is clear that  no  editing  had  been
       done on the records to improve the quality of the assessments  (para
       3.2.4). The reason for Professor French concluding that there  would
       be lesser numbers  of  false  positives  was  the  role  of  trained
       listeners in the processing  of  the  test  checks.  However  it  is
       unclear how much training these listeners had (para 3.3.2),  and  Mr
       Sharma questions the justifications for finding that they  would  be
       in a better position than untrained lay-listeners, particularly with
       reference  to  the  idea  that  their  abilities  were  improved  by
       familiarity with foreign accented English (para 3.3.4). It is  clear
       that they did not have degree qualifications  in  phonetics/  speech
       science (para 3.3.2).

   21. At its highest this report shows that there is a lesser  problem  of
       false  positives  with  ETS's  identification   systems   than   had
       previously be thought, but this does not mean the Secretary of State
       can  show  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  this  claimant
       committed an act of deception when previously the evidence only  was
       just sufficed to provide a case to answer, see paragraph  68  of  SM
       and Qadir. It does not remedy the lack of any evidence from ETS that
       this claimant cheated. Such evidence  that  exists  of  cheating  is
       simply generic, as was noted at paragraph 91 of SM and Qadir.

   22. Further this new evidence does not address the issue of  whether  it
       was possible for a test centre  to  re-use  a  genuine  test-taker's
       voice recording,  without  their  knowledge,  for  subsequent  test-
       takers. At point 2 on page 3 (at  the  top)  of  Professor  French's
       report he clearly states that this issue is outside of his  area  of
       expertise and he provides no  opinion  on  it.  It  remains  totally
       possible therefore that even if this claimant's voice recording  was
       used by others to obtain test results by deception,  and  there  are
       matching voice recordings, that he did not himself commit any act of
       deception.

   23. Mr Sharma concluded by stating that the  claimant  was  entitled  to
       succeed in his appeal under paragraph 319C of the Immigration  Rules
       as for the reasons argued above he had not be  shown  to  have  used
       deception so did not fall to be refused under the general grounds of
       refusal and so fulfils paragraph 319C(a) of the  Immigration  Rules.
       He fulfils paragraphs 319C(b), (d) and (e) of the Immigration  Rules
       as the respondent accepted that he is the spouse of a Tier 4 student
       migrant with valid leave with a genuine and subsisting  marriage  at
       paragraph 16  of the reasons for  refusal  letter,  and  he  clearly
       intends to live with her throughout his stay. He  fulfils  paragraph
       319C(f) because he has confirmed in  his  statement  that  he  would
       abide by the Immigration Rules and so does not intend to stay beyond
       the period of leave  granted  to  his  wife.  He  fulfils  paragraph
       319C(g) because in accordance  with  Appendix  E  he  had  submitted
       evidence to the respondent from the Halifax Building Society in  the
       form of a letter dated 1st July 2014 and a bank  statement  for  the
       period 1st April 2014 to 9th June 2014 showing a balance of �6170.83
       which was in excess of the amount of �5535 which  in  turn  was  the
       maximum amount he could be required to show under Appendix  E.  This
       evidence was shown to me  on  a  computer  file  in  the  claimant's
       solicitor's lap  top,  and  corresponds  to  that  set  out  in  the
       application letter of 4th July 2014. Paragraph 319C (h) is satisfied
       as the claimant had last had leave as a Tier  4  student.  Paragraph
       319C(i) is satisfied as the claimant's wife satisfies paragraph 319C
       (i) (ii) (2) as she was a student at the University of  Ulster,  and
       is now one at the University of  Kingston.  Paragraph  319C  (j)  is
       satisfied as the applicant has not been in the UK in breach  of  the
       immigration laws.

   24. The appeal should therefore  be  allowed.  Mr  Sharma  indicated  he
       intended to apply for a wasted costs order but  would  wait  for  my
       decision first. Mr Tarlow indicated any such  application  would  be
       resisted.

   25. At the end of the hearing I reserved my determination.

Conclusions- Remaking

   26. I am satisfied for the reasons set out at paragraph  23  above  that
       the claimant is entitled to succeed in his appeal in relation to all
       aspects of the Immigration Rules bar the issue of whether  he  falls
       to be refused under  the  general  grounds  of  refusal  for  having
       previously obtained leave  to  remain  by  deception  (and  thus  in
       relation to  his  ability  to  fulfil  paragraph  319C  (a)  of  the
       Immigration Rules). This is the issue therefore on which this appeal
       turns.

   27. I follow SM and Qadir in  finding  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
       generic evidence, combined with  her  evidence  particular  to  this
       appellant, suffices to discharge the evidential  burden  of  proving
       that his TOEIC certificate had been obtained by deception.

   28. The starting point of my analysis in deciding whether the  Secretary
       of State has  discharged  the  legal  burden  upon  her  of  proving
       dishonesty on the part of this claimant are the findings in  SM  and
       Qadir. Clearly in that case the Secretary of  State's  evidence  was
       found to be  woefully  inadequate,  and  once  the  evidence  of  Dr
       Harrison was heard it had "paled and wilted". I  note  that,  as  is
       said at paragraph 102 of SM and Qadir, every ETS/TOEIC case will  be
       fact sensitive  in  that  it  will  involve  an  evaluation  of  the
       individual claimant, and that in the light of this  factor  and  the
       new expert evidence of Professor French that  the  outcome  of  this
       appeal may be different, see also paragraph 103 of SM and Qadir.

   29. I therefore start my consideration of this appeal with  an  analysis
       of the report of Professor French who, like Dr Harrison, is  clearly
       an appropriately qualified expert in the field  of  forensic  speech
       science. My first observation is that in his report Professor French
       relies heavily upon  information  he  was  provided  with  by  ETS's
       solicitors (Jones Day) in  the  form  of  answers  to  a  series  of
       questions put by the Secretary of State. Some of these  answers  are
       referred to in Professor French's report: for instance at  paragraph
       3.2 there is a reference to ETS's response to SSHD  question  24  in
       brackets after Professor French accepts  that  there  will  be  some
       false positives in the automatic speaker recognition system software
       used by ETS. However the questions and answers  themselves  are  not
       appended to the report and the precise statements from ETS or  their
       solicitors (and it is not clear to me from whom  the  words  in  the
       answers came, although clearly the information is said to come  from
       ETS) are not cited in the report. I consider that this is a  serious
       defect, and as was said  in  SM  and  Qadir  at  paragraph  15  with
       reference to  Ms  Collings  failure  to  append  emails  and  letter
       referred to in her witness statement: "this is not  harmonious  with
       elementary good litigation  practice  and  is  in  breach  of  every
       litigant's duty of candour owed to the court of tribunal:"

   30. Professor French's report addresses some of  the  key  issues  found
       wanting with the generic evidence of ETS/TOEIC fraud  identified  at
       paragraph 63 in SM and Qadir. He  clearly  is  a  witness  with  the
       relevant expert qualification providing input into the Secretary  of
       State's case. He also is  able  to  address  a  key  concern  of  Dr
       Harrison, set out at paragraph 36 of SM and Qadir,  in  relation  to
       the issue of the lack of clarity as to  the  likely  rate  of  false
       positives (persons wrongly  identified  as  having  cheated  due  to
       faulty voice matching)  by  virtue  of  his  additional  information
       (provided in the questions and answers document referred to  above),
       and of course his own expert view and understanding of  the  science
       of forensic voice analysis.

   31. Professor French makes it clear that  the  automated  voice  testing
       would have resulted in a number of false positives and  states  that
       this number cannot be estimated with any great degree of  precision,
       see paragraph 3.2 of his report. He notes the  information  provided
       to him meant that the automated system  identified  58,464  matches,
       but the trained listeners  only  confirmed  33,735.  Therefore  only
       57.7% of the automated system matches were accepted,  see  paragraph
       3.3.7 of the report. He sees this high revision of outcome  rate  as
       an indication  that  the  listeners  were  applying  very  stringent
       conditions before confirming a match.

   32. Professor French concludes that the number of false positives  would
       have been largely reduced by the  use  of  "trained  listeners",  or
       persons who had training in auditory phonetic analysis, i.e. to look
       for speaking features as set out at 3.3.1 of his  report.  Professor
       French notes potential limitations to this  training:  it  lasted  3
       days plus a period of mentoring, the  people  responsible  for  this
       training had no university education or training in phonetics/speech
       science, and at paragraph 3.3.6 the listeners were not tested to see
       if they became competent.

   33. However on the positive side he notes that  the  areas  of  training
       were commensurate with those covered in university  forensic  speech
       science  courses.  He  concludes  that  these  listeners  would   be
       significantly less skilled than those with a Master's degree in this
       area and subsequent experience working under supervision  but  would
       be distinctly better than untrained lay-listeners. They  would  also
       have benefited from having reviewed foreign accented English in  the
       past, and  from  working  independently  in  pairs  with  each  pair
       including an experienced listener. Professor  French  believes  that
       the time given by Dr Harrison for a  forensic  speech  scientist  to
       compare two records (10 to 15 hours) is excessive: and in any case a
       third of the time taken would be in note-taking and report  writing.
       In this case report writing was not needed as all that was  done  by
       these listeners was to write the  word  "same"  if  the  result  was
       considered positive. He believes it is therefore likely  that  there
       was not such a disparity between the time spent by ETS listeners and
       other forensic speech scientists.

   34. Professor French does not believe that the studies relied upon by Dr
       Harrison about unfavourable performance rates  for  human  listeners
       undermine his conclusions as the details of  the  systems  in  these
       studies are unclear  and  they  involved  comparisons  of  telephone
       speech and directly recorded microphone speech.

   35. Professor French concludes that in his opinion the number  of  false
       positives would be very small, and if similar  to  the  TOEFL  pilot
       then substantially less than 1%.

   36. Professor French makes clear however that he has no expertise in the
       area of computer and systems security and thus  could  not  give  an
       opinion on whether it was possible that a test centre might  take  a
       recording of a genuine test-taker's voice and reuse it without their
       knowledge for  subsequent  test-takers,  see  paragraph  2  Material
       Received and Instructions - last  paragraph  on  page  2  and  first
       paragraph on page 3 of the report of Professor French.

   37. Professor French's report also does not address  (and  this  is  not
       intended as a criticism of him) other matters of concern in  respect
       of the weakness of the Secretary of  State's  case  as  set  out  at
       paragraph 63 of SM and Qadir. In  summary  the  continuing  lack  of
       actual evidence from ETS themselves, and in particular  the  refusal
       to  provide  the  claimant  with  his  voice   recording   and   the
       acknowledgement by the Secretary of State of her inability to obtain
       this on his behalf; the lack of any evidence of critical analysis by
       the Secretary of  State  of  the  ETS  evidence;  and  the  lack  of
       supporting documentary evidence that could have been appended to the
       statement of Ms Collings.

   38. In relation to the first of these above identified issues I do  note
       that the Secretary of State has now provided an extract from the ETS
       spreadsheet, appended to the witness statement of a Mr M Sartorious,
       which provides this claimant's name and confirmation  that  his  ETS
       test certificate (giving the number) has been designated invalid. In
       Mr Sartorious's statement he confirms this is the information  which
       led to the refusal of this claimant. I have no reason to doubt  this
       sequences of events.

   39. In terms of the claimant in this  case  I  note  that  his  original
       statement was extremely short and  lacking  in  detail.  However  in
       examination in chief he gave significant details about the  speaking
       test he says he took to  obtain  his  TOEIC  result,  he  also  gave
       convincing details as to the reasons  for  choosing  the  particular
       test centre due to his need to make a reasonably rapid reapplication
       as a student following the revocation of the sponsor licence of  his
       first college. His credibility was not challenged in any way  by  Mr
       Tarlow, and his evidence  was  entirely  internally  consistent  and
       consistent with the documents which record when he  took  the  test,
       where he took it and his scores.

   40. The claimant's speaking ability before the Tribunal accords, I find,
       to a lay listener, to the description given by TOEIC of the  ability
       of someone who has obtained his score in the speaking  test  and  is
       given a level 7. He speaks suitable English for the workplace and is
       able to express his  opinions  but  may  have  minor  weaknesses  in
       pronunciation, intonation, use of grammar and use of vocabulary.  Of
       course the hearing has taken place two  years  after  he  took  this
       test, however this claimant has not put forward that he has  studied
       or worked in this period to improve his English, and I bear in  mind
       that he simply wishes to remain as a dependent spouse of his  Indian
       wife. I do not place significant weight on this  matter  but  simply
       observe  that  his  presentation  before  the   Tribunal   was   not
       inconsistent with his having genuinely achieved the result he claims
       to have got in his speaking TOEIC examination.

   41. The claimant arrived in the UK in 2009 with  entry  clearance  as  a
       student and  would  have  had  to  show  that  he  had  the  ability
       (including in the English language) to follow his proposed course. I
       have not been provided however with any  historic  English  language
       qualifications (or indeed any academic qualifications) that  he  has
       acquired. The claimant says  that  he  did  ask  his  solicitors  to
       challenge the allegation by ETS  that  he  cheated,  and  they  have
       provided correspondence from 2015 with Jones Day in which  ETS  have
       refused to provide voice  recordings  and  other  data  relating  to
       individuals. There is also a letter from the Chief Operating Officer
       Mr Mike Wells CBE dated 11th February 2015 which has  been  provided
       to ETS to send in response to  such  enquiries  which  confirms  the
       Secretary of State's opinion  that  ETS  should  not  provide  these
       materials because it would be: "likely to prejudice  the  prevention
       or detection of crime and/ or the  apprehension  or  prosecution  of
       offenders." I am satisfied that the claimant did try what he  could,
       through his solicitors, to seek the evidence of his cheating so that
       he might challenge it further and that this did not prove  possible.
       I am ultimately satisfied that  the  claimant  is  generally  to  be
       considered a credible witness.

   42. Considering all the evidence before me I am not satisfied  that  the
       Secretary of State has discharged  the  legal  burden  on  her.  The
       Secretary of State's evidence from ETS itself is  a  statement  that
       the claimant's score is invalid,  as  set  out  in  the  spreadsheet
       appended to the statement of Mr Michael Sartorius. There is  notably
       no statement from ETS that this means, in their eyes, that  he  used
       deception. At its highest the evidence  of  Professor  French  means
       that ETS's systems identified multiple  test-taking  voices  with  a
       good rate of accuracy and a low rate of false  positives.  There  is
       still  however  the  unanswered  possibility  that  this  claimant's
       genuine recording  was  taken  and  used  by  others  for  deceptive
       purposes. In the context of his own credible evidence that  he  took
       the test and did not cheat I am not  satisfied  on  the  balance  of
       probabilities that the Secretary of State  has  shown  the  claimant
       used deception with evidence of sufficient strength and quality.


 Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside.

   3. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing  it  under  paragraph
      319C of the Immigration Rules.
