For the Appellants:    Ms McCarthy of Counsel instructed by Everest Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nepal born on the  20th  May  1986.  She
    seeks entry clearance to the United Kingdom on  human  rights  grounds;
    specifically wishes to join her mother Mrs Tiratha  Kumari  Thapa,  the
    widow of a former Gurkha  now  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    application for entry clearance was refused in  a  decision  dated  the
    10th October 2018.

 2. The Appellant's appeal against that decision came before the First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Aujla) on the 12th November  2019.    By  his  decision
    promulgated on the 15th November 2019 Judge Aujla  dismissed  both  the
    appeal on human rights grounds.  He concluded that the Appellant  could
    meet the requirements of Annex K of the Immigration Rules.  Insofar  as
    the Appellant relied on Article 8 'outside of the  rules'  Judge  Aujla
    did not consider that a family life existed nor  accordingly  that  the
    decision to refuse entry clearance was disproportionate.

 3. The Appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Permission was granted by the Upper Tribunal (Judge Finch) on the  27th
    July 2020.

    The First-tier Tribunal Decision

 4. That the Appellant could not meet any requirement  of  the  Immigration
    Rules was not in issue. It was plainly accepted  that  she  could  not.
    That, properly, was the starting point for  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    enquiry.

 5. From there it proceeded to consider Article 8 'outside of  the  rules'.
    The first matter  was  to  consider  whether  Article  8  was  engaged.
    Applying R (on the application of Razgar) v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2004] UKHL 27 that involved making  a  finding  as  to
    whether the Appellant, by then a 33 year-old  woman,  shared  a  family
    life with her widowed mother.   The Tribunal  directed  itself  to  the
    guidance on the point in Kugathas v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31, Ghising (family life  -  adults-  Gurkha
    policy) [2012] UKUT 00160 (IAC), Gurung v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 8 and Ghising  &  Ors  (Gurkhas/BOCs  -
    historic wrong - weight) [2013] UKUT 567 (IAC) and found as follows.

 6. The Appellant is a fit and well adult woman who is living alone in  the
    former family home in Nepal. She may feel lonely from time to time, but
    this does not mean that she is in need of the emotional support of  her
    79 year-old mother. The Appellant's siblings are all married and living
    in Nepal and if necessary, she could turn to them  for  support.   Even
    though there is evidence that the Sponsor is  remitting  money  to  the
    Appellant, it was not accepted that there is any  financial  dependency
    here.  There is no reason why the Appellant  cannot  take  up  work  to
    support herself, "like any other woman of her age in her country".  The
    Sponsor's evidence that she needed her daughter to look  after  her  is
    contrary to the underlying basis upon which the application  was  made:
    ie that the daughter is dependent upon the mother.  If  necessary,  the
    Sponsor could look to social services for help.  It was  the  sponsor's
    choice to relocate here.  For all of those reasons,  the  Tribunal  was
    not satisfied that there was, for the purpose of Article 8,  a  'family
    life' between the Appellant and her mother.

 7.  Having  made  that  finding  the  Tribunal  went  on  to   deal   with
    proportionality in the alternative. It found as follows:

         "I find that the interference with the Appellant's family life  was
         caused not by the Respondent's decision but the sponsor's voluntary
         choice to relocate to the United Kingdom on the 27th February  2012
         when she was already 72 years old and the Appellant  was  27  years
         old. In any event, taking the circumstances of  the  Appellant  and
         the sponsor into account and the fact that there was no explanation
         as to why the Appellant was not able to engage  in  productive  and
         resourceful work and maintain herself like  most  other  people  in
         Nepal  who  are  able  to  sustain  themselves,  I  find  that  the
         interference with her  family  life  with  the  sponsor  was  fully
         proportionate".

    The Grounds

 8. The Appellant's grounds are drafted  by  Counsel  Ms  K  McCarthy,  who
    identifies multiple errors in approach by the First-tier Tribunal.  The
    point can however be  reduced  to  this:  despite  the  fact  that  the
    Tribunal sets out various cases at some length in its decision, it  has
    failed to properly apply the guidance therein, and has moreover  failed
    to direct itself to the last and most significant Gurkha case  of  all,
    Jitendra Rai v Entry Clearance Officer (New Delhi) EWCA Civ 320 [2017].
    The key findings of the First-tier Tribunal here are squarely  contrary
    to the guidance in Rai.

    The Response

 9. For the Entry Clearance Officer Mr McVeety submitted that on the  facts
    found by the judge he was entitled to conclude that there was no family
    life: the  bare  fact  of  financial  support  was  not  sufficient  to
    demonstrate real, effective or committed support.   Mr  McVeety  placed
    particular emphasis on the evidence recorded as having  been  given  by
    the Sponsor at the hearing to the effect that she gives her daughter no
    emotional support.  He submitted that this was the end  of  the  matter
    and that this alone justified the finding that there was no family life
    here.

    Discussion and Findings

10. The operative law in respect of such applications is summarised by  the
    Court of Appeal in its decision in Rai.

11. In this Article 8 appeal the first question that had to be decided  was
    whether there was between the Sponsor and the adult Appellant a  family
    life capable of engaging the Convention.  In Rai the  Court  of  Appeal
    set out the authorities relevant to this matter:

         "17. In Kugathas v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
             [2003] EWCA Civ 31, Sedley L.J. said (in paragraph 17  of  his
             judgment)  that  "if  dependency  is  read  down  as   meaning
             "support", in the personal sense, and if one adds, echoing the
             Strasbourg jurisprudence, "real" or "committed" or "effective"
             to the word "support", then it represents ... the  irreducible
             minimum of what family life  implies".  Arden  L.J.  said  (in
             paragraph 24 of her judgment) that the "relevant  factors  ...
             include  identifying  who  are  the  near  relatives  of   the
             appellant, the nature  of  the  links  between  them  and  the
             appellant, the age of the appellant, where and  with  whom  he
             has resided in the past, and  the  forms  of  contact  he  has
             maintained with the other members of the family with  whom  he
             claims to have a family life". She acknowledged (at  paragraph
             25) that "there is no presumption of  family  life".  Thus  "a
             family life is not established between an adult child and  his
             surviving parent  or  other  siblings  unless  something  more
             exists than normal emotional ties".  She  added  that  "[such]
             ties might exist if the appellant were dependent on his family
             or vice versa", but it was "not ... essential that the members
             of the family should be in the same  country".  In  Patel  and
             others v Entry Clearance Officer, Mumbai [2010] EWCA  Civ  17,
             Sedley L.J. said (in paragraph 14 of his judgment, with  which
             Longmore and Aikens L.JJ. agreed) that "what may constitute an
             extant family  life  falls  well  short  of  what  constitutes
             dependency, and a good many adult children ... may still  have
             a family life with parents who are now  settled  here  not  by
             leave or by force of circumstance but by long-delayed right".

         18.  In Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha  policy)  the  Upper
             Tribunal accepted (in paragraph 56 of its determination)  that
             the  judgments  in  Kugathas   had   been   "interpreted   too
             restrictively in the past and ought to be read in the light of
             subsequent decisions of the domestic and  Strasbourg  courts",
             and (in paragraph 60) that "some of the  [Strasbourg]  Court's
             decisions indicate that family life between adult children and
             parents will readily be found, without evidence of exceptional
             dependence". It went on to say (in paragraph 61):

                  "61. Recently, the [European Court of  Human  Rights]  has
                  reviewed the case law, in [AA v United Kingdom [2012] Imm.
                  A.R.1], finding that a significant factor will be  whether
                  or not the adult child has founded a family of his own. If
                  he is still single and living  with  his  parents,  he  is
                  likely to enjoy family life with them. ..."

             The Upper Tribunal set out the relevant passage in the court's
             judgment in AA v United Kingdom  (in  paragraphs  46  to  49),
             which ended with this (in paragraph 49):

                  "49. An examination of the Court's case-law would tend  to
                  suggest that the applicant, a young adult of 24 years old,
                  who resides with his mother and  has  not  yet  founded  a
                  family of his own,  can  be  regarded  as  having  "family
                  life"."

         19.  Ultimately, as Lord Dyson  M.R.  emphasized  when  giving  the
             judgment of the  court  in  Gurung  (at  paragraph  45),  "the
             question whether an individual enjoys family life  is  one  of
             fact and  depends  on  a  careful  consideration  of  all  the
             relevant facts of the particular case". In some instances  "an
             adult child (particularly if he does not  have  a  partner  or
             children of his own) may establish that he has a  family  life
             with his parents". As Lord Dyson M.R. said, "[it] all  depends
             on the facts". The court expressly endorsed (at paragraph 46),
             as "useful" and as indicating  "the  correct  approach  to  be
             adopted",  the  Upper  Tribunal's  review  of   the   relevant
             jurisprudence in paragraphs 50 to 62 of its  determination  in
             Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy), including  its
             observation (at paragraph 62) that "[the]  different  outcomes
             in cases with superficially similar features emphasises to  us
             that the issue under Article 8(1) is highly fact-sensitive".

         20.  To similar effect  were  these  observations  of  Sir  Stanley
             Burnton  in  Singh  v  Secretary  of  State   for   the   Home
             Department [2015] EWCA  Civ  630  (in  paragraph  24  of  his
             judgment):

                  "24. I do not think that the judgments  to  which  I  have
                  referred lead to any difficulty in determining the correct
                  approach to Article 8 in cases involving  adult  children.
                  In the case of  adults,  in  the  context  of  immigration
                  control, there is no legal or factual  presumption  as  to
                  the existence or absence of family life for  the  purposes
                  of Article 8.  I  point  out  that  the  approach  of  the
                  European Commission for Human Rights cited approvingly  in
                  Kugathas   did   not   include    any    requirement    of
                  exceptionality. It all depends on the facts. The love  and
                  affection between an adult and  his  parents  or  siblings
                  will not of itself justify a finding  of  a  family  life.
                  There has to be something more. A young adult living  with
                  his parents or siblings will normally have a  family  life
                  to be respected under Article 8. A child enjoying a family
                  life with his parents does not suddenly cease  to  have  a
                  family life at midnight as he turns 18 years  of  age.  On
                  the other hand, a young adult living independently of  his
                  parents may well not have a family life for  the  purposes
                  of Article 8.""

12. From theses authorities the Court drew two conclusions relevant to  the
    First-tier  Tribunal's  enquiry.  First,   that   Kugathas   has   been
    restrictively  read  and  in  fact  there  exists  no  requirement   of
    'exceptionality' when considering the family life shared between  adult
    children and their parents. Second, that the language  of  'dependency'
    is unnecessary. What matters is whether the adult child  derives  real,
    committed or effective support from his parents. This could be  in  the
    form of financial, physical and/or emotional support.   It  is  against
    that legal background that I have evaluated the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

13. I deal first with Mr McVeety's point on the oral evidence given by  the
    Sponsor.    In its summary of her evidence the  Tribunal  has  recorded
    [at �17]: "she accepted that she did not provide emotional support  and
    help to the Appellant. She was providing no  financial  help  or  other
    guidance". Whilst agreeing that this evidence was starkly  contrary  to
    all of the other material in the case, in particular to  the  Sponsor's
    own witness statement, Mr McVeety submitted  that  this  was  testimony
    crucial to the outcome, since it would be difficult to see how  Article
    8 could be engaged if those things were  true.    The  difficulty  with
    this submission is twofold.

14. First of all, the evidence recorded at  �17  is  squarely  contrary  to
    everything that  the  Sponsor,  and  indeed  the  Appellant,  had  said
    elsewhere. That the matter does not appear to have been visited in  re-
    examination, or by the Judge himself, strongly suggests  that  everyone
    present at the hearing put it down to the confusion of  a  79  year-old
    giving evidence through an interpreter. That this is so is  illustrated
    by her  apparent  denial  that  she  sends  her  daughter  money,  when
    everyone, including the Judge, accepts that does:  remittance  receipts
    were provided.

15. Second, and more importantly, the Judge places no weight at all on this
    evidence in his reasoning.  The Judge instead proceeds on the basis  of
    the case as put - that there continues  to  be  a  close  bond  between
    mother and daughter - and the documentary  evidence  which  established
    that Sponsor was indeed financially supporting the Appellant.  The case
    is rejected for another reason entirely, to which I now turn.

16. The reasoning under the heading "consideration and findings of fact" is
    characterised by an unrelenting focus on one thing: the choices made by
    the parties.   For the  reasons  succinctly  expressed  in  Rai,  I  am
    satisfied that this was an error of law.  The question of whether there
    is, at this moment, a family  life  between  these  two  adults,  is  a
    factual assessment. It does not turn on what  they  could,  should,  or
    might do in the future.  It is however clear that instead  of  focusing
    on that matter, the First-tier Tribunal instead placed great weight  on
    its assessment that the Appellant could  work  to  financially  support
    herself in Nepal and thereby gain her  independence  from  her  mother.
    This reasoning is  wholly  contrary  to  the  guidance  in  Rai.    The
    Appellant did not need to establish a dependency of necessity in  order
    to demonstrate that she continued to  share  a  family  life  with  her
    mother. As a matter of fact, financial support was, and  had  for  many
    years been, given.   There was evidence before the Tribunal - to  which
    I return below - of  the  strong  emotional  bond  between  mother  and
    daughter which, consistent with Nepalese culture, persisted despite the
    Appellant being an adult. The reference to the  Appellant's  health  is
    highly suggestive of the test of exceptionality,  held  in  Rai  to  be
    erroneous. The reference to 'choices' made by  the  parties  overlooked
    the  extremely  difficult  financial  circumstances  faced  by   Gurkha
    families like this one.  That it could be  otherwise  -  the  Appellant
    could work, or marry, or never speak to her  mother  again  -  was  not
    relevant to the facts as they stood at the date of the decision  before
    the Tribunal.

17. As to proportionality - addressed in the alternative - I  am  satisfied
    that the Tribunal erred in failing to give any weight  at  all  to  the
    historical injustice visited  upon  members  of  the  Gurkha  regiment,
    discussed in extenso in the many cases cited by the  Tribunal.  In  the
    context of this family the salient point was that had  the  Appellant's
    father been permitted to settle in the United Kingdom in 1969 after  he
    had completed his 12 years of active service to the  British  Army,  he
    would have done so. The Appellant would have been born here, and  would
    be a British citizen.  As the caselaw makes clear, the finding that she
    could get a job in Nepal went nowhere near to outweighing that powerful
    factor.

18. I therefore set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.

19. On the facts before me I am satisfied that the relatively low threshold
    for  engagement  of  Article  8  is  met.   The  following  facts   are
    particularly relevant to whether the Appellant  enjoys  a  family  life
    with her mother:

      a) According to Nepalese culture the Appellant will remain part of her
         parents' household until she marries;

      b) She remains living in the family home which she has never left;

      c) Prior to her mother coming to the United Kingdom the two had always
         lived together, and they were particularly reliant upon one another
         after the long illness and death of their father/husband;

      d) The Appellant is living a long distance from her siblings in Nepal;

      e) The Sponsor is experiencing loneliness  and  distress  without  her
         daughter;

      f) The Sponsor financially supports the Appellant.

20. Applying the guidance in Rai (and other cases  cited)  I  am  satisfied
    that the Appellant had demonstrated that she still enjoys a family life
    with her mother.

21. As Mr McVeety accepted on behalf of the Respondent, the only  realistic
    outcome from there is for the appeal to  be  allowed,  given  the  very
    substantial weight that is to be attached to  the  historic  injustices
    perpetrated against the Gurkhas.  Put simply the  consequence  of  that
    injustice, for this family, is that Appellant was not born British: had
    her father been permitted to  settle  in  this  country  following  his
    discharge from the Gurkha regiment, she would have been born here to  a
    settled migrant.

    Decisions

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for error of law.

23. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows: the appeal is  allowed
    on human rights grounds.

24. There is no anonymity order.
