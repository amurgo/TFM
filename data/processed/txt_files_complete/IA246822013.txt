Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Ranjha, Sky Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Muhammad Amjid Khan, was born on 1 October 1981 and  is
    a male citizen of Pakistan.  I shall hereafter refer to the  respondent
    as the appellant and to the appellant as the respondent (as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal).

 2. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 28 September  2010.   On
    20 February 2012, he made a combined application for leave to remain as
    a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant and for a biometric residence permit
    (BRP).  By a decision dated 30 May 2013, that application was  refused.
    The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal   (Judge   Fox,
    determining  the  appeal  on  the  papers  at  Glasgow)  which,  in   a
    determination promulgated on 26 February 2014, allowed the appeal.  The
    Secretary of State now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 3. The issue in this appeal may be stated briefly.  As  noted  above,  the
    appellant made his application with supporting documents on 20 February
    2012.  On 23 May 2012, the UK Border Agency made a decision  to  revoke
    the licence of Lincoln's College, London.  This was  the  college  from
    which the appellant had obtained  his  Certificate  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies (CAS).  On 15 August 2012, the UK Border Agency  wrote  to  the
    appellant in the following terms:

         Before the final decision is made and in line with  our  rules  and
         guidance we will suspend consideration of your  application  for  a
         period of 60 calendar days.

         During the 60 day period  it  is  open  to  you  to  withdraw  your
         application and submit a fresh application in a different  category
         or to leave the United Kingdom.  If you do decide to withdraw  your
         application, you will need to confirm this by writing to us at  the
         address given at the top of this page.

         However, if you wish to remain in the UK as a Tier 4 Student, it is
         open to you to obtain a new CAS for a course of study  at  a  fully
         licensed Tier 4 educational sponsor and then submit an  application
         to vary the grounds of your original application.

 4.  The letter went on to indicate:

         If you obtain a new CAS then you will need to submit fresh and  up-
         to-date documents with your application to vary, for example,  bank
         statements showing you are in possession  of  sufficient  funds  to
         cover your course fees and the maintenance requirement.

         You will also need to complete a fresh Tier 4 (General) Application
         form - the most up-to-date version of this form is available on the
         UKBA website.

         In order for your application to vary to be  successful,  you  will
         need to show that you meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
         Rules which are effective on the day you make  the  application  to
         vary.  The latest  version  of  the  Rules  are  available  on  our
         website.

         If you fail to submit a new valid CAS together with  the  requiring
         supporting  documentation  within  the  60  day  period  then  your
         application will be considered on  the  basis  of  the  information
         currently available and you will therefore fall to be refused.

 5. The appellant duly obtained a new  CAS  and  submitted  this  document,
    together  with  details  of  his  financial   circumstances,   to   the
    respondent.  On 30 May 2013, the respondent wrote to the appellant:

         On 20 February 2012 you made a combined application  for  leave  to
         remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant
         under the points system (PBS) and for a biometric residence  permit
         (BRP).

 6. The appellant was  awarded  0  points  for  maintenance  (funds).   The
    explanation given in the letter was that:

         As the closing date of the bank statement submitted in  support  of
         your application is dated 5 October 2012 you need to show  evidence
         of �1,600 maintenance for 28  days  from  8  September  2012  to  5
         October 2012.  However, between 12 September 2012 and 26  September
         2012 your bank statements state you were in possession of  no  more
         than �21 (340 rupees).

         As such, you have not demonstrated that you have the level of funds
         required over the specified 28 day period to be granted as a Tier 4
         (General) Student Migrant.

 7. In his determination [17], Judge Fox wrote:

         Given that the respondent was prepared  to  exercise  a  degree  of
         flexibility in regard to the CAS document it  appears  unfair  that
         the respondent did not extend that flexibility to other outstanding
         information which the respondent  considered  important.   It  also
         seems unfair to me that the respondent did not ask the appellant to
         produce up-to-date information if it was  required  for  his  leave
         application.  It seems to me  therefore  that  the  respondent  has
         shifted the goal posts.  If the only amendment required was  a  new
         CAS document and 60 days had been  afforded  to  the  appellant  to
         produce it, by implication long, the respondent had accepted a bank
         statement submitted by the appellant.  I  find  the  respondent  is
         fixed for the acceptance of the  application  and  must  honour  it
         within the context of this application for leave.  The date of  the
         application did not change.

 8. It should be emphasised that the "60 day" arrangement  referred  to  in
    the documents and which I have quoted above  does  not  appear  in  the
    Immigration Rules.  I have been provided by the appellant  with  copies
    of a number of policy guidance documents including one entitled "Tier 4
    of the points-based system - policy guidance" which is "to be  used  by
    all prospective and existing Tier 4 sponsors from 9 July 2012."  Whilst
    the guidance is provided for educational providers who wish to join  or
    remain on the  Sponsor  Register,  part  of  the  guidance  relates  to
    applicants who have "have an application under consideration  with  the
    Home Office."  Part  of  that  guidance  is  relevant  to  the  current
    appellant's circumstances and provides as follows:

    If the Tier 4 Sponsor's licence is revoked your CAS will become invalid
    and your application may be refused.  However, if you were not involved
    in the reasons why the Tier 4 Sponsor had their licence revoked or  why
    it was surrendered we will delay the refusal of your application for 60
    days to allow you to regularise your stay or leave the UK.  The  action
    you can take to regularise  your stay in the UK depends on  what  leave
    you have:

           . If your permission to stay is expired whilst you are  awaiting
             a decision on your application [the present appellant made his
             application for further leave to remain  the  day  before  his
             existing leave expired] you will delay the  refusal   of  your
             application of 60 days to allow you to obtain a new CAS from a
             different sponsor and vary your application or leave the UK.

         In all cases we will write to you informing  you  of  the  date  by
         which you should provide a new CAS.  If you fail to provide the CAS
         within the specified period your application will be considered  on
         the basis of the evidence submitted with your application.

 9. It is not in dispute that the appellant could not meet the  maintenance
    requirements for the  period  8  September  2012  to  5  October  2012.
    Equally, there is  no  dispute  that  the  bank  statements  and  other
    supporting  documents  which  he  submitted  with  his  application  in
    February 2012 did meet those maintenance requirements for the  required
    28 day period prior to the initial submission of his application.

10. The respondent submits that the judge erred  in  law  by  allowing  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.  The respondent  submits  that  the
    appellant had to show that he had the necessary funds for the  required
    period preceding his submission of the new and valid CAS document.

11. The language used in the policy guidance document and the letter of  15
    August 2012 is significant.  The policy  guidance  from  which  I  have
    quoted above makes no reference to an applicant submitting  a  new  CAS
    also being required to submit fresh maintenance documents.  The  policy
    guidance at [581] simply notes that the respondent would write  to  the
    student "informing them of the date by which they should provide a  new
    CAS if they intend to do so."  The application would be considered (and
    no doubt refused) on the "basis of  the  evidence  submitted  with  the
    application" if the applicant failed to provide a new  CAS  within  the
    specified period; no mention is made of any sanction which would follow
    from a failure to provide up-to-date financial evidence.  The letter of
    15 August 2012 (unlike the policy guidance) refers to variation  of  an
    application.  The variation of the applications or claims for leave  to
    remain are subject to  the  provisions  paragraph  34E  -  43I  of  the
    Immigration Rules:

    Variation of Applications or Claims for Leave to Remain

    34E. If a person wishes to vary the purpose of an application or  claim
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom and an  application  form  is
    specified for such new purpose or paragraph A34 applies, the  variation
    must comply with the requirements of paragraph 34A or paragraph A34 (as
    they apply at the date the variation is made) as if the variation  were
    a new application or claim, or the variation will be invalid  and  will
    not be considered.




    34F. Any valid variation of a  leave  to  remain  application  will  be
    decided in accordance with the immigration rules in force at  the  date
    such variation is made.

    34G. For the purposes of these rules, the date on which an  application
    or claim (or a variation in accordance with paragraph 34E) is  made  is
    as follows:




    (i) where the application form is sent by post, the date of posting,




    (ii) where the application form is submitted in  person,  the  date  on
    which it is accepted by a public enquiry office of the  United  Kingdom
    Border Agency of the Home Office,







    (iii) where the application form is sent by courier, the date on  which
    it is delivered to the United Kingdom Border Agency of the Home Office,
    or







    (iv) where the application is made via the online application  process,
    on the date on which the online application is submitted.







    34H. Applications or claims for leave to remain made before 29 February
    2008 for which a form was prescribed prior to 29 February 2008 shall be
    subject to the forms and procedures as in force on the  date  on  which
    the application or claim was made.




    34I. Where an application or claim is made no more than 21  days  after
    the date on which a form is specified under the immigration  rules  and
    on a form that was permitted for such application or claim  immediately
    prior to the date of such specification, the application or claim shall
    be deemed to have been made on the specified form.




12. Paragraph 34E refers to varying "the purpose of an application or claim
    for leave to remain ..." On the most obvious construction of the  rule,
    the present appellant did  not  seek  to  vary  the  "purpose"  of  his
    application which has throughout remained the same (that is, to  remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant).  Is it possible then that the appellant
    has, in effect, "varied" his  application  by  seeking  to  change  the
    educational provider with whom he intends to study?  I do not find that
    the  wording  of  paragraph  34E  can   bear   such   a   construction.
    Significantly,  paragraph  34E  refers  to  the  possibility  that  "an
    application form is specified for such new purpose  ..."  A  change  of
    educational sponsor  would  not  involve  the  appellant  using  a  new
    application form.  Further, the reference in paragraph 34E to paragraph
    34A would  also  indicate  that  the  appellant  was  not  varying  his
    application in the manner intended  by  paragraph  34.   Paragraph  34A
    requires an applicant to use  the  correct  form  for  the  new  varied
    application and to  pay  any  specified  fee;  the  appellant  was  not
    required to send in a further fee with his new CAS.  Paragraph  A34  is
    also referred to in paragraph 34E.  This provides:

    A34. An application for leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  under
    these Rules must be made  either  by  completing  the  relevant  online
    application process in accordance with paragraph A34 (iii) or by  using
    the specified application form in accordance  with  paragraphs  34A  to
    34D.




    (i) "The relevant online application  process"  means  the  application
    process accessible via the visas and immigration pages  of  the  gov.uk
    website and identified there as relevant for applications for leave  to
    remain for the immigration category under which the applicant wishes to
    apply.




    (ii) "Specified" in relation to the relevant online application process
    means specified in the online guidance accompanying that process.




    (iii) When the application is made via the relevant online  application
    process:




    (a) any specified fee in connection with the application must  be  paid
    in accordance with the method specified;




    (b) if the online application process requires the applicant to provide
    biometric information that information must be provided as specified;




    (c) if the online application process requires supporting documents  to
    be submitted by post then any such  documents  specified  as  mandatory
    must be submitted in the specified manner within  15  working  days  of
    submission of the online application;




    (d) if the online application process requires the applicant to make an
    appointment to attend a public enquiry office  of  the  United  Kingdom
    Border Agency the applicant must, within 45 working days of  submission
    of the online application, make and attend that appointment; and comply
    with any  specified  requirements  in  relation  to  the  provision  of
    biometric information and documents specified as mandatory.




    (iv) Where an application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  is
    made  by  completing  the  relevant  online  application  process,  the
    application will be invalid if it does not comply with the requirements
    of paragraph A34(iii) and will not be considered.




    Notice of invalidity will be given in writing and deemed to be received
    on the date it is given, except where it is sent by post, in which case
    it will be deemed to be received on the second day after it was  posted
    excluding any day which is not a business day.




    It is not clear how the requirements of paragraph A34 are  relevant  in
    the  present  circumstances.   I  hold  that  this  appellant  was  not
    required, notwithstanding the language used in the letter sent  to  him
    by the respondent, to  "vary"  his  application  in  any  manner  which
    brought his application under the provisions of  paragraph  34  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  I find that the "60 day" concession was provided to
    the  appellant  wholly  outside  the  context  of  the  Rules  and,  in
    consequence, the Rules did not compel  the  appellant  to  comply  with
    financial or other  requirements  both  at  the  date  of  his  initial
    application and at the date when he submitted the new CAS form.

13. I acknowledge that the letter sent to the appellant told him (albeit in
    somewhat vague terms) that, in order for his "application to vary (sic)
    to be successful" he would  need  to  "meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  which  are  effective  on  the  day  you  make  the
    application to vary."  However, that requirement appears nowhere in the
    respondent's official policy  guidance.   Further,  whilst  it  may  be
    permissible for the respondent  to  grant  a  concession,  outside  the
    Immigration Rules, ameliorating the potentially harsh  consequences  of
    matters which may be wholly outside the control  of  an  applicant  for
    entry clearance (i.e. in this case, the revocation of  the  licence  of
    the appellant CAS sponsor) it is  not  lawful  for  the  respondent  to
    impose upon an applicant stricter conditions than  those  contained  in
    the  Immigration  Rules  (see  Pankina  [2010]  EWCA  Civ  719).    The
    Immigration Rules which deal with Tier 4 (General) Migrants provide for
    the maintenance requirement to be met for a 28 day period prior to  the
    making of the application; the respondent's  letter  to  the  appellant
    dated 15 August 2012 seeks to extend that requirement to a  further  28
    day period occurring some eight months later.  I find that, whilst  the
    appellant was entitled to take advantage of the "60 day" period offered
    to him by the respondent in which to submit a new CAS document, he  was
    not required to meet the maintenance  requirements  for  the  period  8
    September 2012 to 5 October 2012.

14. It follows that the First-tier Tribunal did not err in law by  allowing
    his appeal under the Immigration Rules.  The appellant was  awarded  30
    points for his CAS and he should have been awarded maximum  points  for
    proving that he met the maintenance requirements for the 28 day  period
    prior to the submission of his original application in February 2012.







DECISION

15. This appeal is dismissed.
