                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department.
    We shall refer to Mr Yang, who was the appellant before the  First-tier
    Tribunal, as the claimant.

 2. The claimant is a citizen of China born 1 February 1988.  He arrived in
    the United Kingdom on 18 July 2012 with leave to  enter  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student conferred until 7 October 2012.  On 5 October 2012 he
    made an application to extend his  leave,  in  order  to  study  for  a
    postgraduate qualification at the University of Liverpool.

 3. By way of decisions dated 14  January  2013,  the  Secretary  of  State
    refused to vary the claimant's leave and made a decision to remove  him
    pursuant to Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act
    2006.

 4. In relation to the former decision the Secretary of State  awarded  the
    claimant zero points for his Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for  Studies
    under Appendix A to the Immigration Rules;  as  a  consequence  of  his
    failure to provide the original  of  a  Bachelor  of  Arts  certificate
    identified on the Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for  Studies  as  being
    evidence relied upon by the University of Liverpool when admitting  the
    claimant onto the course of studies.

 5. The Secretary of State also awarded zero  points  in  relation  to  the
    maintenance  requirement  of  Appendix  C  to  the  Immigration  Rules,
    concluding, when doing so, that  the  claimant  had  been  required  to
    demonstrate that he had �6,200 in his possession for a consecutive  28-
    day period including, and immediately preceding, the  4  October  2012.
    The claimant had in excess of �6200  in  his  bank  account  between  7
    September 2012 and 3 October 2012, however, the balance of the  account
    fell to just �2,050.28 on 4 October 2012.

 6. The claimant appealed these decisions to the First-tier Tribunal.  This
    appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Flynn,  who  allowed  it
    "under the Immigration Rules" for given in a determination  promulgated
    on 20 May 2013.

 7. The judge found that, in failing to make a request of the  claimant  to
    produce his original Bachelor of Arts  certificate,  the  Secretary  of
    State had acted otherwise in accordance with the law by not adhering to
    her stated policy [paragraphs 20-22 of the determination]. This finding
    has not been the subject of challenge before the Upper Tribunal.

 8. In relation to the maintenance requirement  of  the  Rules,  the  judge
    concluded as follows:

         "23. Secondly, the respondent stated that the appellant had  failed
             to demonstrate that he holds the required level of funding for
             the period of 28 consecutive days.  I note  that  his  current
             account  bank  statements  (which   he   provided   with   the
             application) cover the period  from  2  September  2012  to  4
             October 2012.

         24.  It is clear that between 4 September and 3 October  2012,  the
             level of funds was at all times  in  excess  of  the  required
             amount.

         25.  The respondent's guidance makes it  clear  that  an  applicant
             will satisfy her requirements  if  he  demonstrates  that  the
             funds were held for any consecutive 28 day  period  ending  no
             more than one month before the application was made.

         26.  It is not clear why the respondent calculated  backwards  from
             the last date of the statement, but I am  satisfied  that  her
             decision to assess the funds in this way was not in accordance
             with her guidance.  I am entitled to take any account  of  the
             appellant's savings, since he did not submit this evidence  to
             the respondent prior to her decision."

 9. The Secretary of State obtained permission to appeal on three  grounds;
    the latter two of which were based on a misreading of paragraph  26  of
    the First-tier Tribunal's determination and, as a consequence, have not
    been  pursued  before  the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  Secretary  of  State
    maintains,  however,  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  erred  in
    concluding that the SSHD's approach to the maintenance requirement  was
    not in accordance with "guidance"; the judge having failed to  identify
    which guidance was being referred to.

10. In his submissions  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  Mr  Adophy  initially
    maintained that the claimant  met  the  terms  of  Appendix  C  of  the
    Immigration Rules because (i)  there  was  no  requirement  within  the
    Appendix C that the end date of the 'continuous 28 day period' must  be
    the date of the  closing  balance  on  the  most  recent  of  the  bank
    statements relied upon [in the instant case that being 4 October  2012]
    and, in any event, (ii) the Tribunal was entitled to take into  account
    monies held in other bank accounts held by the  claimant,  despite  the
    fact that no statements of account, or other evidence, relating to such
    accounts had been sent to the Secretary of State  with  the  claimant's
    application.

11. After discussion, Mr Adophy indicated that he, "reluctantly",  accepted
    that the claimant could not meet the requirements of paragraph 245ZX of
    the Immigration Rules, as a consequence of his inability  to  establish
    that he was entitled to 10 points  pursuant  to  Appendix  C  of  those
    Rules. Mr Adophy further accepted that the determination of the  First-
    tier Tribunal ought to be set aside.

12. We now explain why Mr Adophy was correct in his concession.

13. Contrary to Mr Adophy's initial submissions it is trite law that by the
    application of sections 85, 85A (3) and (4),  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was not entitled to consider any evidence that had not been  sent  with
    the claimant's application to the Secretary of State, when  determining
    the appeal brought in relation to the decision made under  Part  6A  of
    the Immigration Rules [Alam v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 960].  We  pause  to
    observe that although at first blush it appeared  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in taking into account evidence that  had  not  been
    sent to the Secretary of State with the claimant's  application,  on  a
    careful analysis it did not do so; the confusion in this regard arising
    out of an obvious accidental slip in the terms  of  paragraph  26,  the
    judge plainly intending, but failed, to include the word 'not'  in  the
    last sentence of that paragraph. The parties before us agreed this  was
    so.

14. Turning, as we must, to the bank statement that  was  produced  by  the
    claimant with his application for leave to remain, this relates  to  an
    account held in the claimant's name at Barclays Bank.  It  is  dated  4
    October 2012 and lists transactions between  4  September  2012  and  4
    October 2012 inclusive. The balance of the  account  is  in  excess  of
    �6500 on each of these dates, save for the 4 October when  the  balance
    was �2,050.28. The balance falls on the 4 October as a consequence of a
    payment having been made on that date to the University of Liverpool in
    the sum �4998, the purpose of such payment  being  for  the  claimant's
    accommodation. Relevant to our reasons below we also observe  that  the
    balance of the account was less than �7200 from 1  October  2012  to  4
    October.

15. The relevant paragraphs of Appendix C read as follows:

        "1A  In all cases where an applicant is required to  obtain  points
        under Appendix C, the applicant must meet the  requirements  listed
        below:

          a) the applicant must have the funds specified  in  the  relevant
             part of Appendix C at the date of application;

           ...

           b) if the applicant  is  applying  as  a  Tier  4  Migrant,  the
              applicant must have had the funds referred to  in  (a)  above
              for a consecutive 28 day period of time;

           ...

           (h)    The end date of the 90-day and 28-day periods referred to
              in (b) and (c) above will be taken as the date of the closing
              balance on the most recent of the specified documents  ...and
              must  be  no  earlier  than  31  days  before  the  date   of
              application..."

16. Paragraph 11 of Appendix C identifies the 'specified' amount  that  the
    claimant was required to have held for the relevant consecutive  28-day
    period as:

        "funds amounting to the full course fees  for  the  first  academic
        year of the course...plus �800 for each month of the course up to a
        maximum of nine months"

17. The claimant had paid his course fees by the date of his application to
    the Secretary of State and, consequently, the sum of the monies he  was
    required to have held for the relevant consecutive  28-day  period  was
    �7200 [i.e. 9 x �800].

18. In relation to the accommodation costs, paragraph  13A  to  Appendix  C
    provides as follows:

        "In assessing whether the requirements of Appendix C, paragraph 11,
        are met, where an applicant  pays  a  deposit  on  account  to  the
        sponsor for accommodation costs the maximum  amount  that  will  be
        offset against the total maintenance requirement to be met in �1000
        irrespective of the actual amount of the deposit paid."

19.  The  claimant  was,  therefore,  entitled  to  offset  �1000  of   the
    accommodation costs that he paid on the 4  October  2012,  against  the
    �7200 specified by paragraph 11; thus bringing the total sum  that  the
    claimant was required to demonstrate he had continuously held  for  the
    relevant 28-day period to �6200.

20. There is dispute as to the correct date to be taken as the  'end  date'
    of the consecutive 28-day period for the purposes of Appendix C to  the
    Immigration Rules. Mr Adophy submits that as long as the  Secretary  of
    State [or thereafter the Tribunal on appeal]  can  identify,  from  the
    specified documents supplied with the application, any  continuous  28-
    day period during which the applicant held the required funds, and that
    the end date of that 28-day period was no earlier than 31  days  before
    the date of application, then ten points must points must be awarded to
    the applicant under Appendix C.

21. We do not accept that the position  posited  by  Mr  Adophy  accurately
    reflects the requirements set out in paragraph 1A(h) to Appendix C.

22. An applicant can elect which 'end date' he wishes to rely  on  for  the
    calculation under Appendix C. Such choice  is  restricted  by  (i)  the
    requirement that the chosen end date must be no earlier  than  31  days
    before the date of application, and (ii) the fact  that  the  specified
    documents sent to the Secretary of  State  with  the  application  must
    demonstrate that the required funds were available for a continuous 28-
    day period expiring on the chosen end date.

23. The chosen end date is identified by  reference  to  the  date  of  the
    closing balance on the relevant specified documents the  applicant  has
    decided to submit. Once the application has been sent to the  Secretary
    of State the 'end date' is fixed, by operation of  paragraph  1A(h)  of
    Appendix C.

24. In the instant case the end date [of the continuous 28-day period]  was
    the 4 October 2012, this being the date of the closing balance  on  the
    only bank statement sent by the claimant, with his application, to  the
    Secretary of State. If the applicant had intended the 3 October 2012 to
    be the 'end date' of the relevant  continuous  28-day  period,  he  was
    required to send, with his application, a bank statement which had  the
    3 October as the date of its closing balance; he did not do so.

25. On the 4 October 2012, the balance of the bank account relied on by the
    claimant was less than �6200. Consequently, the claimant could not meet
    the requirements of Appendix C of the Immigration Rules.

26. Even if the claimant were correct in his assertion  that  the  relevant
    end date could be treated as being the 3 October 2012,  he  still  does
    not meet the requirements of the Appendix C. The claimant did  not  pay
    his accommodation fees until the 4 October. Consequently,  if  an  'end
    date' is chosen prior to 4 October he would not gain the benefit of the
    �1000 offset for accommodation costs. He would, therefore, be  required
    to demonstrate that he had held �7200 (as  opposed  to  �6200)  in  the
    specified account for a consecutive 28-day period. He could not do  so,
    the balance of the account being below �7200 on each of the 1, 2 and  3
    October 2012.

27.  Returning  to   a   consideration   of   the   First-tier   Tribunal's
    determination, it is clear from what we say above that the judge  erred
    in law in concluding that the claimant  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules, he did not.

28. In paragraph 22 of her determination the judge the found the  Secretary
    of State's calculations of the maintenance requirement  not  to  be  in
    accordance with her 'guidance'. Even if this were correct, it  was  not
    capable of leading the judge to a conclusion that the appeal  ought  to
    be allowed on the basis that Secretary of State's decision was  not  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules.

29. First, on the facts of  this  case,  the  claimant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix A of the Rules because he did not  supply  his
    original degree certificate with his application.  Although  the  judge
    concluded that the Secretary of State  acted  otherwise  in  accordance
    with the law in not requesting such certificate; this  did  not  permit
    the conclusion that the requirements of the Appendix A had been met.

30. Second, and of more general application, if the Secretary of State  has
    in place guidance,  or  a  policy,  which  is  more  beneficial  to  an
    applicant than the Immigration Rules, failure to apply such guidance or
    policy does not lead an appeal being allowed  on  the  basis  that  the
    Secretary of State's decision was not accordance  with  the  Rules  but
    rather has the potential to render the Secretary  of  State's  decision
    unlawful.

31. As it turns out, in the instant case our file does not contain  a  copy
    of the 'guidance' referred to by the  judge  in  paragraph  22  of  his
    determination. In addition, both parties confirmed that  they  did  not
    place any guidance before the First-tier Tribunal and neither party has
    been able to produce to us a copy the guidance the judge referred to.

32. It is clear from all  we  say  above  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination contains errors on points of law that required it  to  be
    set aside.

33. We announced that decision  at  the  hearing  and  invited  submissions
    relevant to the re-making of the decision under appeal.

34. Whilst accepting that the claimant could not meet the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules, Mr Adophy initially submitted that the Secretary
    of State's decision was, in all  the  circumstances,  unfair.  However,
    upon Mr McVeety (i) conceding that the Secretary of State's decision to
    remove the claimant was unlawful for the reasons given in Javad  Ahmadi
    [2013] EWCA Civ 512 and (ii) undertaking  that  prior  to  any  further
    removal decision being taken the Secretary of  State  would  give  full
    consideration  to  the  claimant's  Article  8  ECHR  rights  and   any
    representations made by him in relation the  issue  of  unfairness,  Mr
    Adophy withdrew his submissions.

35. We therefore dismiss the claimant's appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision refusing to vary his  leave.  He  does  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and no other grounds were pursued
    before us. We allow the claimant's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision to remove him.

Decision

For the reasons given above the determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
contains an error on a point of law and is set aside.

The claimant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision refusing  to
vary his leave is dismissed

The claimant's appeal against the Secretary of State's  decision  to  remove
him is allowed.

No application was made to us requesting that the fees paid by the  claimant
for appealing to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  be  awarded  to  him.  In  such
circumstances we make no fee award. Had such application been made we  would
not, in all the circumstances of this case, have acceded to it.
