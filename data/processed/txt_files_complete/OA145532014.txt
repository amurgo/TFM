Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Grubb instructed by Qualified Legal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. I make an anonymity order under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/2698  as  amended)  in  order  to
    protect the anonymity of the sponsor's children.  This order  prohibits
    the disclosure directly or indirectly (including by the parties) of the
    identity of the appellant or her children.  Any disclosure  and  breach
    of this order may amount to a contempt  of  court.   This  order  shall
    remain in force unless revoked or varied by a Tribunal or court.

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on  2  April  1981.
    The appellant and  "MI"  (the  sponsor)  married  in  January  2014  in
    Pakistan.

 3. MI was previously married to a British citizen and he and  his  ex-wife
    have three children: F, born on [ ] 2000; R, born on [ ]  2006  and  K,
    born on [ ] 2010.  Consequently, they are now 16, 9  and  6  years  old
    respectively.

 4. F and K live with their mother in the UK.  R lives with the sponsor  in
    the UK.  The living arrangements  are  as  a  result  of  an  agreement
    reached between the sponsor and his ex-spouse and local Social Services
    at the time of his divorce in 2013 (see document at  page  114  of  the
    bundle).

 5. On 16 April 2014, the appellant made an application for entry clearance
    under Appendix FM to join the sponsor in the UK as his spouse.

 6. On 22 October 2014, the ECO refused that application on the basis  that
    the appellant could not establish that he had the required  maintenance
    funds under Appendix FM (namely a gross annual salary of  �18,600)  and
    the appellant had not submitted a certificate to  satisfy  the  English
    language requirement of the Rules.

 7. That decision was upheld by the Entry Clearance Manager  on  7  January
    2015.

 8. The application was also refused on the basis that the appellant  could
    not establish a breach of Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 30 June 2015, Judge Britton  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal.  First, he  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, namely Appendix FM as a  spouse.
    The appellant was unable to establish, on the basis  of  the  specified
    documents, that at the date of  the  application  the  sponsor  had  an
    annual gross income of �18,600 from his  self-employment  as  a  double
    glazing salesman.  Further, the appellant had not submitted an original
    English language test certificate (although she had submitted  a  copy)
    which, as a result, was insufficient to  establish  that  she  met  the
    English language requirement of the  Rules.   Secondly,  Judge  Britton
    held that the respondent's decision did not breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

10. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against
    the decision to dismiss her appeal under Art 8.  No challenge was  made
    to the judge's decision to dismiss the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  It is not suggested that the appellant met the requirements  of
    the Rules at the date of the ECO's decision.

11. The grounds argue that the judge failed properly to consider  the  best
    interests of the sponsor's three children and failed properly  to  make
    an assessment of proportionality under Art 8 of the ECHR.

12. On 22 October 2015, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fisher) granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal on both grounds.

13. On 29 October 2015, the respondent filed a rule 24 response seeking  to
    uphold the judge's determination  on  the  basis  that  the  judge  had
    properly considered the children's best interests and the appellant had
    failed to demonstrate,  given  that  she  could  not  comply  with  the
    requirements  of  the  Rules,  why  she  should  not  make  a   further
    application.

The Judge's Decision

14. Having set out the five stage approach in Razgar [2004] UKHL 24 at para
    19 of his determination, the judge dealt with Art 8 in paras  23-24  as
    follows:

         "23. In relation to Article 8 the sponsor  is  able  to  travel  to
             Pakistan  and  throughout  the  south  of  England  and  Wales
             although he suffers from back ache.

         24.  I have considered section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and
             Immigration Act 2009 which states  that  the  respondent  must
             have regard for the need to safeguard and promote the  welfare
             of children who are  in  the  United  Kingdom.   I  have  also
             considered what is  in  their  best  interest.   There  is  no
             evidence before me why his first wife cannot  look  after  the
             three children if the sponsor went to live with the  appellant
             in Pakistan.  He can visit the children and keep in touch with
             them through Skype and other electronic means.  However, it is
             a matter for him if he wishes to join his wife.  The appellant
             has had no family life in  this  country.   I  find  that  any
             interference with the appellant's private and family  life  is
             proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aims   of   applying   the
             immigration policy of the United Kingdom".

Error of Law

15. Ms Grubb, who represented the appellant,  submitted  that  the  judge's
    treatment of Art 8 in his determination  at  paras  23-24  was  legally
    inadequate.  It was a  superficial  assessment  which  failed  to  take
    properly into account in  accordance  with  the  case  law,  the  three
    children's best interests.  In fact, Ms Grubb submitted that the  judge
    had not made any finding in respect of their best interests.   But,  in
    any event, he  had  failed  to  carry  out  the  appropriate  balancing
    exercise taking those interests into account.  She submitted that there
    was no assessment of  the  family's  current  arrangements.   Ms  Grubb
    submitted that the judge was wrong to say that there  was  no  evidence
    that the sponsor's ex-wife could not look after the three  children  if
    the sponsor went to live with the  appellant  in  Pakistan.   In  fact,
    there was evidence from the sponsor himself that his ex-wife would  not
    be able to look after all three children particularly  given  that  the
    eldest  child,  F,  suffered  from  Autistic  Syndrome  Disability  and
    required more care and attention than the other two children.

16. Mr Richards, on behalf of the Entry Clearance  Officer,  accepted  that
    the judge had not engaged in a comprehensive analysis of the children's
    best interests or Art 8.   He  accepted  that  there  was  no  specific
    finding in relation to their best interests but that it  was  clear  on
    reading the judge's determination what he had  decided.   He  submitted
    that those best interests were not a  trump  card  and  the  judge  was
    entitled to find that there was no evidence that the sponsor's  ex-wife
    could not look after all the children and that the sponsor  could  live
    with the appellant in Pakistan.  Mr Richards  submitted  that  had  the
    judge approached the issue of proportionality in a more structured  and
    detailed manner, it was difficult to see how  the  outcome  could  have
    been any different.

17. There are, in my judgment, a number of difficulties  with  the  judge's
    treatment of Art 8.

18. First, despite setting out the Razgar test, in  paras  23  and  24  the
    judge jumps straight to the  final  issue  of  proportionality  without
    identifying what, if any, private and family life exists and the nature
    of any infringement affected by the respondent's decision.

19. Secondly, the judge does not make any explicit finding in  relation  to
    the best interests of the three  children.   There  was,  as  Ms  Grubb
    submitted, at least the oral evidence of the sponsor that  his  ex-wife
    would be unable or unwilling to look after the  three  children  if  he
    went to Pakistan.  Apart from that, and the judge's  stated  view  that
    the children could keep in touch with the sponsor by electronic  means,
    the judge does not engage with any  impact  there  might  be  upon  the
    children including what, if anything, he made of the sponsor's evidence
    that the eldest child suffered from Autistic Syndrome Disability.

20. Thirdly, in assessing proportionality the  judge  fails  to  apply  the
    proper structured approach of first considering whether  the  appellant
    succeeds under the Rules (which of course he  did  consider)  but  then
    going on to determine whether  there  were  "compelling  circumstances"
    sufficient to outweigh the public interest (see SSHD v SS  (Congo)  and
    Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387).

21. In my judgment, Judge Britton  has  failed  properly  to  consider  the
    appellant's claim under Art 8.  In AG (Eritrea) v SSHD [2007] EWCA  Civ
    801 at [37] Sedley LJ said this:

         "What matters is not that the courts and Tribunals should  adopt  a
         set formula for determining proportionality, but they  should  have
         proper and visible  regard  to  relevant  principles  in  making  a
         structured decision about it case by case.  It is  not  sufficient,
         as still happens, for the Tribunal simply to characterise something
         as proportionate or disproportionate:  to  do  so  may  well  be  a
         failure of reasoning amounting to an error of law".

22.  Although  Judge  Britton  does  not  fall  into  the  trap  of  simply
    characterising the respondent's  decision  as  proportionate,  for  the
    reasons I have given he has failed adequately to reason  through  in  a
    structured way  the  appellant's  claim  under  Art  8.   That,  in  my
    judgment, amounts to an error of law.

23. In addition, the judge makes no reference to the  factors  set  out  in
    s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  which,  by
    virtue of s.117A(2), he was mandated to have regard to  in  determining
    the "public interest question", namely that  of  proportionality  under
    Art 8.2.

24. Although Mr Richards sought to argue that any error was immaterial  and
    it was difficult to see how the outcome could have been any  different,
    I do not accept that submission.  The lack of reasoning  and  necessary
    findings  leaves  me  unable  to  conclude  on  reading   the   judge's
    determination alone  that  his  error  could  have  no  effect  on  his
    decision.

25. For those reasons, the judge's  decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under Art 8 is set aside and must be re-made.

Re-making the Decision

26. I now turn to re-make the decision under Art 8.   Art  8  of  the  ECHR
    provides as follows:

         "Article 8

         1.   Everyone has the right to respect for his private  and  family
             life, his home and his correspondence.

         2.   There shall be no interference by a public  authority  of  the
             exercise of this right except such as is  in  accordance  with
             the law and is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
             interests of national security, public safety or the  economic
             well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder  or
             crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or  for  the
             protection of the rights and freedoms of others".

27. The burden  is  upon  the  appellant  to  establish  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities that the failure to grant her entry clearance to join the
    sponsor in the UK will breach Art 8.  The burden is upon the  Secretary
    of State to justify any interference  with  the  appellant's  right  to
    respect for her private and family life under Art 8.2.

28. In applying Art 8, the five stage test set out in the opinion  of  Lord
    Bingham of Cornhill in R (Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 at [17]  is  as
    follows:

         "(1) Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
             authority with  the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
             respect for his private or (as the case may be) family life?

         (2)  If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

         (3)  If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

         (4)  If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
             economic well-being of the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

         (5)  If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             public end sought to be achieved?"

29. At [20], as regards the issue of  proportionality,  Lord  Bingham  said
    this:

         "[it] always involve(s) the striking of a fair balance between  the
         rights of the individual and the interests of the  community  which
         is inherent in the whole  of  the  Convention.   The  severity  and
         consequences of the interference will call for a careful assessment
         at this stage".

30. As this is an entry clearance case, and not a removal case, the  appeal
    engages the state's "positive  obligation"  rather  than  the  negative
    obligation not to interfere with an  individual's  private  and  family
    life.  However, the  approach  to  Art  8,  whilst  not  identical,  is
    analogous in such positive obligation cases (see, SSHD v SS (Congo) and
    others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at [39(ii)]).

31. Further, as the appellant does not argue that she can succeed under the
    Immigration  Rules,  the  appellant  must  establish  that  there   are
    "compelling" circumstances sufficient to outweigh  he  public  interest
    such that her continued exclusion from the UK would be disproportionate
    (see SS (Congo) at [40]).  In determining whether there is a breach  of
    Art 8 in this appeal, by virtue of s.117A(2) I must have regard to  the
    factors set out in s.117B of  the  NIA  Act  2002  in  determining  the
    "public  interest  question",  i.e.  proportionality  under  Art   8.2.
    Section 117B provides as follows:

         "117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable  in  all
             cases

         (1)   The maintenance of effective immigration controls is  in  the
             public interest.

         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English -

             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons -

             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to -

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that  is
                  established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in
                  the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
             a person at a time when the  person's  immigration  status  is
             precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where -

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom".

32. Further, I must have regard not only to the rights of the appellant but
    also the rights of the sponsor and the sponsor's children  (see  Beoku-
    Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39).

33. In that regard, the best interests of the sponsor's three children  are
    a "primary consideration" (see ZH (Tanzania) v  SSHD  [2011]  UKSC  4).
    Although a primary consideration, the best interests  of  the  children
    are not necessarily determinative of the issue of proportionality since
    those interests can be outweighed by  sufficiently  strong  or  weighty
    considerations of the public interest (see also Zoumbas v  SSHD  [2013]
    UKSC 74 at [10]).

34. I turn now to consider the evidence and to make  relevant  findings  in
    relation to Art 8.

35. The evidence is somewhat sparse.  The sponsor gave oral evidence before
    Judge Britton and I was referred to relevant parts of that evidence  by
    Ms Grubb.  There was also a written statement from the sponsor dated 27
    April 2015 dealing with the Art 8 issues at paras 11-18.  The bundle of
    documents  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contained  some  relevant
    documents  to  which   I   was   referred,   including   the   parental
    responsibility  agreement  (page  114);  documents  relating   to   the
    sponsor's back pain and physio treatment (at pages 111-113).  Ms  Grubb
    did not seek to introduce any further evidence before me.

36. I am satisfied that the appellant has established family life with  the
    sponsor following their marriage in January 2014.  I did not understand
    Mr Richards to dispute that.  The sponsor's evidence was  that  he  had
    remained with his wife following the wedding and had made a  number  of
    visits since that time including taking his son R  with  him.   I  also
    accept that the appellant has established a relationship with R  which,
    if not yet family life, is a close relationship in her  role  as  step-
    mother amounting to private life.

37. The sponsor has three children from his previous marriage living in the
    UK.  They are all British citizens aged 16, 9 and 6 years respectively.
     The eldest and youngest child live  with  their  mother.   The  middle
    child, R, lives with the sponsor.  I accept the sponsor's evidence that
    he has a close relationship with his children and  that  he  takes  the
    younger two to school each day and the youngest comes to stay with him.
     His eldest son, he sees more sporadically, perhaps because of his  age
    and he comes to see him 'as and when'.

38. Before Judge Britton the sponsor gave oral evidence that his eldest son
    suffered from Autistic  Syndrome  Disability.   The  sponsor  makes  no
    mention of that in his written statement and  there  is  no  supporting
    evidence of a diagnosis or in  relation  to  the  elder  son's  claimed
    condition.  Whilst I am prepared to accept that  the  sponsor  was  not
    seeking to mislead Judge Britton, even if his eldest  son  does  suffer
    from that  condition,  there  is  no  evidence  before  me  as  to  the
    implication that has for his son or his future care by his  parents  or
    others.  It is, however, curious that the matter was not referred to in
    the sponsor's written statement provided  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and, if a diagnosis has been made, that no supporting documentation was
    submitted.

39. That said, I accept that there is family life between the  sponsor  and
    his three children in the UK.

40. Turning to the children's best interests, Mr Richards did not  actively
    pursue an argument that their best interests lay other  than  remaining
    in the UK.

41. It is generally in the interests of children to have both parents  and,
    despite the possibility of electronic communication  (for  example  via
    Skype), that cannot be a fully adequate substitute for actual  face  to
    face contact in daily life which each of his children currently  enjoys
    with the sponsor.  Further, it is not, in  my  judgment,  in  the  best
    interests of the children or reasonable to expect them  to  live  other
    than in the UK.  They are all British citizens and their lives have, so
    far as I am aware, always been in the UK.  It would  not  be  in  their
    best interest to uproot them, if the sponsor were to leave  the  UK  to
    live with the appellant in Pakistan, and leave behind  their  lives  in
    the UK including their mother.

42. Consequently, I am satisfied that it is in their  best  interests  that
    the sponsor should remain in the UK with them.

43. As regards the sponsor, I accept that it would not  be  reasonable  for
    him to leave the UK, leaving  behind  his  three  children.   Whilst  I
    accept that modern electronic forms  of  communication,  in  particular
    such as Skype, allow  for  an  ever  increasing  degree  of  maintained
    contact between families, that cannot be a  fully  adequate  substitute
    for contact where a parent and children are able to meet  and  interact
    in the same place.

44. Consequently, in my judgment, the effect of the  respondent's  decision
    (if maintained) it is likely that the sponsor and  appellant  will  not
    (subject to any future successful application for  entry  clearance  by
    the appellant) live together in the same place on  an  on-going  basis.
    That said, of course, the sponsor could, as he has in  the  past,  make
    visits to see the appellant in Pakistan such that some  actual  contact
    as well as electronic contact through Skype can be maintained.  Even if
    his former spouse could not look after all 3 children  on  a  long-term
    basis there is nothing in the evidence she would be unable or unwilling
    to do so on a short-term basis.

45. Ms Grubb submitted that it was in the best interests  of  the  children
    that the appellant should be admitted to  the  UK  as  she  could  then
    further her relationships with the children, support  the  sponsor  and
    allow for his and the children's (particularly R's) family life  to  be
    enhanced.  In his statement, the sponsor speaks  of  his  chronic  back
    pain and of his need for support in "household" chores.  It would also,
    he says, assist that he has the support of the appellant  in  order  to
    help his work, which involves travelling, by for example, helping  pick
    up his son from school and  preparing  evening  meals.   I  take  these
    matters into account but there  is  no  evidence  before  me  that  the
    sponsor is unable to cope with his current family arrangements  in  the
    UK despite the fact that the appellant does  not  live  with  him  and,
    indeed, that the current arrangements were unsatisfactory  even  before
    his marriage to the appellant.

46. I now turn to s.117B of the NIA Act 2002.

47. First, looking at s.117B, the appellant cannot meet the requirements of
    the Rules and the maintenance of effective immigration  control  is  in
    the public interest (see s.117B(1)).

48. Secondly, it is in the public interest that  the  appellant  should  be
    able to speak English (see s.117B(2)).  Whilst the appellant was unable
    to produce the original English language certificate  at  the  required
    level, she has produced a copy and, for these purposes, I  am  prepared
    to accept that she is able to  speak  English.   Mr  Richards  made  no
    submission to the  contrary.   The  appellant  can,  however,  gain  no
    positive benefit from this fact (see AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260
    (IAC) and Forman (ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC))

49. Thirdly, it is in the public interest  that  the  appellant  should  be
    financially independent  (see  s.117B(3)).   Here,  the  appellant  was
    unable to meet the financial requirements in  Appendix  FM  based  upon
    establishing that the sponsor had the required income of  �18,600.   It
    may be that that sets the required level of  "financial  independence".
    But, for the purposes of this appeal, I am content to accept  that  the
    evidence before Judge Britton did not suggest that the appellant  would
    be, in fact, reliant upon public funds.

50. Finally, s.117B(4), (5) and (6) have no  application  in  this  appeal.
    Nevertheless, the circumstances in  which  the  appellant  and  sponsor
    formed their family  life  is  relevant  under  Art  8.2  applying  the
    Strasbourg and domestic jurisprudence.  In SS (Congo) at  [39(i)],  the
    Court of Appeal - reflecting the existing case law - stated that:

         "Article 8 does not confer an automatic right  of  entry,  however.
         Article 8 imposes no general obligation on a  state  to  facilitate
         the choice made by a married couple to reside in it ...  the  state
         is entitled to control immigration ...".

51. Here, the appellant and sponsor formed their family life at a time when
    neither could have any expectation  that  they  could  carry  on  their
    family life  in  the  UK  unless  they  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules which they do not.

52. In SS (Congo), the Court of Appeal (at [40]) recognised that the:

         "state has a  wider  margin  of  appreciation  in  determining  the
         conditions to be satisfied before [leave to enter] is  granted,  by
         contrast with the  position  in  relation  to  decisions  regarding
         [leave to remain] for persons with a [non-precarious]  family  life
         already established in the United Kingdom.  The Secretary of  State
         has already, in effect, made some  use  of  this  wider  margin  of
         appreciation by excluding Section EX.1 as a basis for the grant  of
         [leave to enter], although it is available as a basis for grant  of
         [leave  to  remain].   These  [leave  to  enter]  Rules   therefore
         maintain, in general terms,  a  reasonable  relationship  with  the
         requirements of Article 8 in the ordinary run of  cases.   However,
         it remains possible to imagine cases where the individual interests
         at stake are of particularly pressing nature so that a  good  claim
         for [leave to enter] can be established outside the Rules.  In  our
         view, the appropriate general formulation for this category is that
         such cases will arise where an applicant for [leave to  enter]  can
         show  that  compelling   circumstances   exist   (which   are   not
         sufficiently recognised under the new Rules) to require  the  grant
         of such leave".

53. That is the approach I must apply in this appeal.

54. Separation of a married couple does not necessarily  breach  Art  8:  a
    balance has to  be  struck  between  the  impact  upon  the  couple  of
    continued separation and the public interest (see, e.g.  SSHD  v  Huang
    [2007] UKHL 11 at [20]).  The appellant and sponsor have  no  automatic
    right to live together in the UK.  They formed their family  life  when
    they had no expectation of remaining unless they met  the  requirements
    of the Rules.  There will, of course, be an impact upon  them  if  they
    cannot live together in the UK.  As I have already indicated, I do  not
    consider it reasonable to expect the sponsor to  relocate  to  Pakistan
    leaving behind his children.  There remains, of course, the opportunity
    for visits (as in the past) to Pakistan and contact through such  means
    as Skype.  The appellant can, at any time,  make  a  fresh  application
    under the Rules once the sponsor is in a position  to  demonstrate  his
    income meets the financial requirements of the  Rules.   That  is,  and
    remains, an important reflection of  the  public  interest.  I  am  not
    satisfied that the evidence  establishes  any  significant  or  serious
    impact upon the appellant and sponsor beyond that ordinarily  resulting
    from the separation of a married couple.

55. Ms Grubb placed some reliance upon the cases of Chikwamba v SSHD [2008]
    UKHL 40 and SSHD v Hayat and Treebhowan [2012] EWCA Civ 1054 especially
    at [30].  These  cases  were  concerned  with  the  proportionality  of
    removing an individual only to seek entry clearance where their failure
    to meet the requirements of  the  Rules  for  leave  whilst  in-country
    turned upon a lack of lawful leave in circumstances where it was  plain
    that, on return to their own country, they would meet the  requirements
    for entry clearance.  Unless there was a "sensible" or "good"  "reason"
    for enforcing the requirement of seeking entry clearance, the House  of
    Lords held that it was likely that even a temporary disruption to their
    private and family life, particularly  where  children  were  adversely
    affected, would be disproportionate under Art 8.  In my judgment, those
    cases cannot assist the appellant  in  this  appeal.   This  is  not  a
    removal case.  There is no question of "sending back" an individual  to
    seek entry clearance: it is an entry clearance case in any event.   The
    appellant is already outside the UK and she cannot, at present, satisfy
    the requirements for entry clearance.  The case is  not  about  whether
    temporary interference with private and family life in the  UK  enjoyed
    by the appellant is or is not justified by requiring the  appellant  to
    obtain entry clearance which he or  she  would  self-evidently  obtain.
    Here, the appellant has not established that she can presently meet the
    requirements for entry clearance and the issue  is  whether  there  are
    "compelling" circumstances such that maintaining the status quo is  not
    proportionate.

56. I remind myself  that  he  best  interests  of  the  children  are  not
    determinative and may be outweighed by  a  sufficiently  strong  public
    interest.   The public interest in effective immigration control is, in
    my judgment, a weighty consideration in this appeal.  Having considered
    all the circumstances and the best interests of the sponsor's children,
    I am not satisfied that there are compelling  circumstances  so  as  to
    outweigh the public interest clearly reflected in  the  fact  that  the
    appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Rules, in particular  the
    financial requirements.  It remains open to the  appellant  to  make  a
    fresh  application  for  entry  clearance  when  she   can   meet   the
    requirements of the Rules.

57. For all these reasons, the appellant has not established on  a  balance
    of probabilities that the respondent's decision  to  refuse  her  entry
    clearance breaches Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

58.  Thus,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss   the
    appellant's appeal under Art 8 involved the making of an error of  law.
    That decision is set aside.

59. I re-make the decision dismissing the appellant's appeal under Art 8.

60. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules is not challenged and stands.
