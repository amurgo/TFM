Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr D Mills Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr C Lane, counsel, instructed by JR Jones
solicitors (Ms Chaggar at the hearing on 24th January 2014)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. In a decision promulgated following a hearing on 24th January 2014  we
      found that the First-tier Tribunal judge had erred in law in  allowing
      an appeal against deportation on the following basis:


   1. The appellant (hereafter the SSHD) appeals a decision  of  the  First-
      tier Tribunal which allowed an appeal by the respondent (hereafter the
      claimant) against a decision 18th February 2013 by the SSHD to  deport
      the claimant.


   2. Permission to appeal had  been  granted  on  the  basis  that  it  was
      arguable that a panel of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Pooler sitting
      with Dr J O de Barros, a non-legal member of the Tribunal) who,  by  a
      determination promulgated on 16th October 2013, allowed his appeal  on
      the grounds that although there remained a risk of  re-offending,  the
      degree of integration in the UK,  the  lack  of  any  links  with  the
      Netherlands and the greater prospects of rehabilitation in the UK  led
      to the conclusion that the decision did not comply with the  principle
      of  proportionality  as  required  by  regulation  21(5)   Immigration
      (European Economic Are) Regulations 2006 as amended.


   3. The claimant, a citizen of the Netherlands date of birth 7th June 1993
      had a number of convictions:
   i. On 24th September 2009, 30th October 2009 and 13th  November  2009  he
      was convicted of three separate offences of theft and on each occasion
      a referral order was made or extended;
  ii. On 27th April 2010 was fined for a public  order  offence  (disorderly
      behaviour or threatening or abusive or insulting words). The  referral
      order made on 24th September 2009 was revoked and an attendance centre
      order was made;
 iii. On 28th October 2010, 31st January 2011 and 4th June  he was convicted
      of three separate offences of possession of cannabis and fined;
  iv. On 31st March 2011 he was convicted of  theft  and  received  a  youth
      rehabilitation order with a six month supervision requirement;
   v. On 10th May he was fined for resisting or obstructing a constable
  vi. Three offences were  committed  whilst  on  bail  (two  possession  of
      cannabis and one failing to surrender);
 vii. On 17th August 2012 he was convicted following a plea of guilty to  an
      offence of robbery for which he  received  a  sentence  of  two  years
      detention in a young offender institution,  one  offence  of  handling
      stolen property for which  he  received  a  sentence  of  six  month's
      detention concurrent and a further offence of  robbery  for  which  he
      received a sentence of eighteen months detention consecutive.


   4. The First-tier Tribunal panel found that the claimant had not acquired
      a right of permanent residence in accordance with the Regulations  and
      reached its decision on the appeal on the basis  that  the  claimant's
      appeal was to be considered on the basis that he had the lowest  level
      of protection afforded to an EEA National.  They  found,  inter  alia,
      that the claimant "poses a significant risk of future offending" [38],
      that he "acquired, over  time,  offences  of  increasing  seriousness"
      [42], "no relatives remaining in the  Netherlands"  [44(b)],  that  it
      cannot be said that he is "well advanced in  rehabilitation"  [44(d)],
      that the "prospects of rehabilitation are far greater in the  UK  than
      in the Netherlands" [44(d)].


   5. Reference was made in submissions before us  to  the  requirements  of
      genuine integration, or substantial degrees  of  integration  and  the
      relevance of being well advanced in rehabilitation (Essa  [2013]  UKUT
      00316 (IAC) paragraphs 26, 30 and  34;  see  also  Tsakouridis  [2013]
      EUECJ C - 145/09; Onuekwere [2013] EUECJ Case C - 378/12 including the
      advocate general's opinion;  The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department v MG[2014] EUECJ C-400/12 It was submitted that the  First-
      tier Tribunal panel had failed  to  weigh  in  its  consideration  the
      escalating  criminality,  the  issue  of  integration,  the  lack   of
      rehabilitation and that there was no evidence upon which  to  conclude
      that rehabilitation would not be available in the Netherlands  to  the
      same extent or with the same effect as  in  the  UK.  In  response  Ms
      Chaggar submitted that the decision, when  read  as  a  whole  clearly
      looked at the particular circumstances of the claimant and reached  an
      overall assessment of the proportionality of the decision.


   6. We announced at the hearing that we were satisfied that the panel  had
      materially erred in law for the reasons which we now give.


   7. On a reading of the determination as a whole we are unable  to  accept
      that the panel had weighed in the balance the  countervailing  factors
      in the claimant's appeal; although noted by the panel  these  did  not
      appear to have been taken account of in the overall assessment of  the
      proportionality of the decision. There is a want of reasoning on  this
      key aspect. We note that no evidence as to the rehabilitation  process
      in the Netherlands was before the panel such as to enable a finding to
      be made that the claimant would not be able to avail himself  of  such
      processes. We conclude that the panel has failed to  factor  into  its
      decision all of the  relevant  issues  and  failed  to  give  adequate
      reasons for the decision reached, such failure amounting to  an  error
      of law such that the decision be set aside to be remade.


   8. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  panel  is  set  aside  to  be
      remade.

   1. We made the following directions:


   1) the findings of fact in the First-tier Tribunal panel determination in
      [38, 39, 40, 42] stand together with the finding that the claimant has
      resided in the UK since September  2000;  that  he  has  no  remaining
      family in the Netherlands; he was not (in October 2013) well  advanced
      in rehabilitation;
   2) The claimant have leave to file and serve an up to date OASys report;
   3) The SSHD to file and serve an up to date PNC
   4) The claimant have leave to  file  an  updated  witness  statement  and
      witness statements from members of his family as he  wishes  to  call,
      regarding the time spent in Somalia;
   5) Both parties to file and serve skeleton arguments 10 days  before  the
      resumed hearing, such skeletons to consider in particular  the  issues
      of integration, rehabilitation and residence;
   6) Oral evidence to be called  from  the  claimant  and  his  father;  no
      interpreter required.


   Hearing on 16th April 2014


   2. The findings preserved from the First-tier Tribunal were as follows:


   i. the appellant poses a significant risk of future offending;
  ii. the risk is likely to reduce if the appellant makes  constructive  use
      of his spare time, associated with law abiding peers and used his time
      constructively via unpaid  work  and  structured  interventions.  This
      would be by attendance on the Thinking  Skills  programme,  addressing
      how his behaviour affects others and better self management. He  would
      benefit from engagement in education and training programmes;
 iii. the  appellant  has  completed  courses  related  to  basic  literacy;
      numeracy; alcohol awareness and constructions skills;
  iv. his offending history shows he has acquired convictions over  time  of
      increasing seriousness ;
   v. there are no adjudications against him in prison since April 2013;
  vi. As of October 2013 he  had  not  "learned  his  lesson";  he  has  not
      accepted full responsibility for his actions;
 vii. He has not attended formal courses addressing offending  behaviour  or
      thinking;
viii. The personal conduct of the appellant represents  a  genuine,  present
      and sufficiently serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
      interests of society.
  ix. He has been in the UK since 2000 and was a child on entry; he attended
      primary and secondary school in the UK;
   x. He has no remaining family in the Netherlands
  xi. He does not have a permanent right of  residence  nor  the  additional
      protection acquired by 10 years residence; his deportation  is  to  be
      considered against the lowest level of protection afforded by the  EEA
      Regulations.


   3. The claimant filed witness statements from himself and his father  and
      we heard oral evidence in relation to the time the claimant  spent  in
      Somaliland for about 9 months in 2011 namely: his family had sent  him
      there in order to visit relatives and to encourage rehabilitation.  He
      had disliked it there intensely: the food, the social,  community  and
      living arrangements. Whilst there he had worked for an uncle in a shop
      and had returned to the UK against the wishes of  his  UK  family.  Mr
      Madar also confirmed completion of  his  Thinking  Skills  course  and
      produced  the  records  and  certificates  of  his  various  completed
      courses. There was no cross examination  of  either  witness,  and  no
      challenge to this evidence.


   4. The SSHD filed an email from the  claimant's  offender  manager  which
      stated

             "...Mr Madar is still assessed as  posing  a  medium  risk  of
             reoffending and a high risk of harm. This  assessment  relates
             to the fact that he committed 2 robberies in one  evening  and
             shortly after committed a robbery in  an  Internet  Caf�.  The
             Robbery in the Internet Caf�  was  witnessed  by  the  victims
             children who were aged 3 and 4 years at the time. They were so
             traumatised by what they witnessed wet  themselves  when  they
             witness the robbery. The victim gave chase and in order to get
             his phone back and tripped and broke his arm as a result.


             ....The victims children now aged 5 and 6  years  continue  to
             have nightmares about the offence. Their father has also begun
             to suffer from anxiety attacks and has  been  unable  to  work
             since. Another victim requested conditions that  Mr  Madar  be
             given an exclusion zone not to enter the  Edgebaston  Area  of
             Birmingham  as  he  feared  being  recognised  and   fear   of
             repercussions.


             On a positive side not (sic) I can confirm that I  visited  Mr
             Madar's family at their home address. Present were his mother,
             father and older sister,  his  younger  brother  was  away  at
             university. They presented an extremely supportive family have
             pledged to work with  the  Probation  Service  and  any  other
             organisation to facilitate the rehabilitation of their son  in
             the UK.


             I can also confirm that Mr Madar has made  positive  steps  to
             address his offending whilst in prison. He is  a  more  sombre
             young man than the one I wrote the report on 18 months ago. He
             has  successfully  completed  the  Thinking  Skills  Programme
             whilst in custody and I have noticed a change in his  attitude
             over  the  past  six  months.  He  has  also   expressed   his
             willingness to cooperate with his licence and  the  conditions
             imposed. There is no doubt in my  mind  that  his  resolve  to
             change his lifestyle will  be  severely  tested/challenged  on
             release.

   5. The updated PNC filed  by  the  SSHD  confirmed  the  claimant  had  7
      convictions for theft and kindred offences, 1 public disorder offence,
      3 offences relating to police/courts/prisons and 3 drug offences.


   6. A summary of information on probation in the Netherlands filed by  the
      SSHD states that the Probation Service

             "..... can only perform probation activities  as  commissioned
             by the judicial authorities: the  Public  Prosecutor  Service,
             the judiciary and the prison system. That means that there  is
             no 'voluntary contact' with detainees.
             Ex-detainees are not  supervised  by  the  Probation  Service,
             unless this  is  within  the  framework  of  the  Penitentiary
             Programme (in that case, detention is still continuing) or for
             the  conditional  release  if  special  conditions  have  been
             imposed: the Probation Service then supervises  and  helps  to
             achieve compliance with those conditions.




   7. There was no evidence  produced  to  us  how  those  deported  to  the
      Netherlands entered any supervision or rehabilitation programme in the
      Netherlands.


   8. We received skeleton arguments and heard oral  submissions  from  both
      representatives. It was accepted by both parties that  the  claimant's
      deportation was justified save for the question of proportionality

   9. The position of the SSHD is (in essence) that rehabilitation  is  only
      of relevance  where  an  individual  can  be  said  to  be  "genuinely
      integrated" in the host Member State,  relying  upon  Tsakouridis  and
      Essa and that there  is  "no  basis  to  conclude  that  prospects  of
      rehabilitation should be treated as relevant factor in a case where  a
      permanent  right  of  residence  has  not  been  established."   As  a
      secondary position the SSHD submits that if  relevant,  rehabilitation
      should be afforded little  weight  in  the  proportionality  balancing
      exercise. Essa refers obliquely to this in terms of rehabilitation  in
      the individual's state of origin with which s/he has  not  lost  links
      leading to the potential for an application to  revoke  a  deportation
      order. It was not accepted that there would be any adverse effects  on
      the claimant's prospects of  rehabilitation  by  his  removal  to  the
      Netherlands and relied upon  the  documents  submitted  outlining  the
      availability of probation services in the Netherlands. Furthermore the
      SSHD submitted that it had  not  been  shown  that  his  prospects  of
      rehabilitation, even  if  found  to  be  relevant  in  law,  would  be
      significantly diminished in his home country and thus this was  of  no
      relevance in the proportionality balance.

  10. The claimant's submission, in essence, was that the claimant's  social
      and cultural integration is specifically required to be considered and
      that the greater the degree of integration, the greater the degree  of
      protection from expulsion. To submit,  as  the  SSHD  does,  that  the
      commission of crime indicates either that there was no integration  in
      society or that such integration as there was,  was  expunged  by  the
      commission of offences would mean that  regulation  21(6)  has  little
      meaning; integration is a question of fact to  be  considered  in  the
      circumstances of any  given  case.  The  claimant  also  submits  that
      rehabilitation is a factor and should be considered not only from  the
      perspective of the individual but also the wider perspective of the EU
      as a whole.

Legislative framework

  11.  Article 21  Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  ("TFEU")
      states that


         "1. Every citizen of the Union shall have the  right  to  move  and
         reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to
         the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties and by the
         measures adopted to give them effect."

  12.  Article 20 of the TFEU states

        "1. Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person
        holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the
        Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not
        replace national citizenship. "


  13. Article 27 of Directive 2004/38/EC is as follows


                            1. Subject to the provisions  of  this  Chapter,
                               Member States may  restrict  the  freedom  of
                               movement and residence of Union citizens  and
                               their   family   members,   irrespective   of
                               nationality, on  grounds  of  public  policy,
                               public  security  or  public  health.   These
                               grounds  shall  not  be  invoked   to   serve
                               economic ends.
                            2. Measures taken on grounds of public policy or
                               public  security  shall   comply   with   the
                               principle of  proportionality  and  shall  be
                               based exclusively on the personal conduct  of
                               the individual concerned....


  14. Article 28 0f Directive 2004/38/EC is as follows


                            1.  before  taking  an  expulsion  decision   on
                               grounds of public policy or public  security,
                               the host Member State shall take  account  of
                               considerations   such   as   how   long   the
                               individual  concerned  has  resided  on   its
                               territory,  his/her  age,  state  of  health,
                               family and  economic  situation,  social  and
                               cultural integration  into  the  host  Member
                               State and the extent of  his/her  links  with
                               the country of origin.


  15. The  Directive  was  implemented  through  the  Immigration  (European
      Economic Area) Regulations 2006 and, where relevant  to  this  appeal,
      are as follows:




             "Regulation 19(3) (b)


             "...the Secretary of  State  has  decided  that  the  person's
             removal is justified  on  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health in accordance with regulation 21"


             Regulation 21
             1) In this regulation  a  'relevant  decision'  means  an  EEA
                decision taken on grounds of public policy, public security
                or public health.
             2) A relevant decision may not  be  taken  to  serve  economic
                ends.
             ....
             (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on  grounds  of  public
             policy or public security it shall, in addition  to  complying
             with the preceding paragraphs of this regulation, be taken  in
             accordance with the following principles -
                  (a) the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
             proportionality
               (b) the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
               conduct of the person concerned;
               (c)  the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
               represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat
               affecting on  of the fundamental interests of society;
               (d) matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
               which relate to considerations of general prevention  do  not
               justify the decision;
                  (e) a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.
             (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public
             policy or public security in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
             resident in the United Kingdom the decision  maker  must  take
             account of considerations such as the age,  state  of  health,
             family and economic situation  of  the  person,  the  person's
             length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's social
             and cultural integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
             extent of the person's links with his country of origin.

  16. In Tsakouridis, the ECJ makes reference to the balance to be struck



             " [50] .... between the exceptional nature of  the  threat  to
             public security as a result of the  personal  conduct  of  the
             person concerned....by reference in particular to the possible
             penalties and the sentences imposed, the degree of involvement
             in the criminal activity,  and  if  appropriate  the  risk  of
             reoffending....on the one hand, and, on the  other  hand,  the
             risk of compromising the social rehabilitation  of  the  Union
             citizen  in  the  State  in  which  he  has  become  genuinely
             integrated, which, as the Advocate General observes  in  point
             95 of his Opinion, is not only in his interest but  also  that
             of the European Union in general.


             [51] The sentence passed must be taken  into  account  as  one
             element in that complex of factors. A sentence of five  years'
             imprisonment cannot lead to an expulsion decision, as provided
             for in national law, without  the  factors  described  in  the
             preceding paragraph being taken into account, which is for the
             national court to verify.
             .....
             [53]  To  assess  whether  the  interference  contemplated  is
             proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, in this case  the
             protection of  public  security,  account  must  be  taken  in
             particular of  the  nature  and  seriousness  of  the  offence
             committed, the duration of residence of the  person  concerned
             in the host Member State, the period which  has  passed  since
             the offence was  committed  and  the  conduct  of  the  person
             concerned during that period, and the solidity of the  social,
             cultural and family ties with the host Member  State.  In  the
             case of a Union citizen who has lawfully spent  most  or  even
             all of his childhood and youth in the host Member State,  very
             good reasons would have to  be  put  forward  to  justify  the
             expulsion measure (see to that effect, in particular,  (Maslov
             v Austria ��71 to 75."

  17. P.I. Case C-348/09, again  a  case  involving  imperative  grounds  of
      public  security  and  thus  the  highest  level  of  protection  from
      expulsion, refers to the preambles to  the  Directive,  in  particular
      preambles 23 and 24 and the reference to  "genuine  integration".  The
      question referred to  the  Court  was  whether  the  term  "imperative
      grounds of public security" covered only threats posed to the internal
      and external security of the State in terms of the continued existence
      of the State. In [34] the court states


             ".... Before taking an expulsion decision on  the  grounds  of
             public policy or public security, the host Member  State  must
             take account of considerations such as how long the individual
             concerned has resided on its territory, his/her age, state  of
             health, family and economic  situation,  social  and  cultural
             integration into that State and the extent  of  his/her  links
             with the country of origin."

  18. In M.G. Case C-400/12 there is again reference to preambles 23 and 24.
      The UK in that case  had  taken  the  view  that  enhanced  protection
      against expulsion is dependent  upon  the  integration  of  the  Union
      citizen into the host state and  that  such  integration  cannot  take
      place while that citizen is  in  prison.  The  court  also  determined
      issues as to the calculation of the 10  year  period  referred  to  in
      Article 28(3) (a) of the Directive and as regards  the  assessment  of
      serious grounds of public policy or public security, such  issues  not
      being relevant to the determination of the present appeal. In [23] the
      court holds


             "... it should first be noted that the Court has  found  that,
             while recitals 23 and 24 in the preamble to Directive  2004/38
             certainly refer to special  protection  for  persons  who  are
             genuinely integrated into the host Member State, especially if
             they were born there and have spent all their life there,  the
             fact remains that, in view of the wording of Article 28 (3) of
             that directive, the decisive criterion is  whether  the  Union
             citizen lived in that Member State for the 10 years  preceding
             the expulsion decision...
             [35] As for the question of  the  extent  to  which  the  non-
             continuous nature of the period of  residence  during  the  10
             years preceding the decision to  expel  the  person  concerned
             prevents him form enjoying  enhanced  protection,  an  overall
             assessment must be made of that  person's  situation  on  each
             occasion at the precise time when the  question  of  expulsion
             arises (see to that effect Tsakouridis, paragraph 32).
             [36] In that regard,  given  that  in  principle,  periods  of
             imprisonment  interrupt  the  continuity  of  the  period   of
             residence for the purposes of Article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive
             2004/38, such periods may - together with  the  other  factors
             going to make up the entirety of  relevant  considerations  in
             each individual case - be taken into account by  the  national
             authorities responsible for applying  Article  28(3)  of  that
             directive as part  of  the  overall  assessment  required  for
             determining whether the integrating  links  previously  forged
             with the host Member State have  been  broken,  and  thus  for
             determining whether the enhanced protection  provided  for  in
             that  provision  will  be  granted  (see,  to   that   effect,
             Tsakourides, paragraph 34).
             ....
             [38].......the fact that  that  person  resided  in  the  host
             Member State for the 10 years prior  to  imprisonment  may  be
             taken into consideration as part  of  the  overall  assessment
             required in order to determine whether the  integrating  links
             previously forged with the host Member State have been broken.
             "

22.  In Onuekwere Case C-378/12, the  Court  considered  the  issue  of  the
exclusion  of  periods  of  imprisonment  in  calculating  the  duration  of
residence to assess Mr Onuekwere's right to permanent residence as a  family
member of an EU national. Referring to integration the court says

             [25]  ....  Integration,  which  is  a  precondition  of   the
             acquisition of the right of permanent residence laid  down  in
             Article 16(1) of  Directive  2004/38  is  based  not  only  on
             territorial and  temporal  factors  but  also  on  qualitative
             elements, relating to the level of  integration  in  the  host
             Member State  (see  Case  C-325/09  Dias  [2011]  ECR  I-6387,
             paragraph 64), to such an extent that the undermining  of  the
             link of integration between the person concerned and the  host
             Member State justifies the loss  of  the  right  of  permanent
             residence even outside the circumstances mentioned in  Article
             16(4).....
             [26] The imposition of a prison sentence by the national court
             is such as to show the non-compliance by the person  concerned
             with the values expressed by the society of  the  host  member
             State in its criminal law, with the  result  that  the  taking
             into consideration of periods of imprisonment for the purposes
             of the acquisition by family members of a Union  citizen,  who
             are not nationals of a Member State of the right of  permanent
             residence for the purposes of Article  16(4)....would  clearly
             be  contrary  to  the  aim  pursued  by  that   directive   in
             establishing that right of residence.

23.  Advocate General Bot in his opinion in Onuekwere states

             [49] ...the integration which lies behind the  acquisition  of
             the right of permanent residence laid down in Article 1691) of
             Directive 2004/38 is based not only on  territorial  and  time
             factors but also on  qualitative  elements,  relating  to  the
             level of integration in the host Member State.
             [50] Periods of residence in prison of course make clear  that
             the person concerned is integrated to only a  limited  extent.
             That is even more true where, as  in  the  case  in  the  main
             proceedings, that person is a  multiple  recidivist.  Criminal
             conduct in my opinion clearly shows that the person  concerned
             has no desire to integrate into the society of the host Member
             State.
             ....
             [54] It is clear that every sentence must, in accordance  with
             the fundamental principles of the law on sanctions, comprise a
             rehabilitative element to be achieved by appropriate means  of
             implementation. Nevertheless if a sentence is imposed,  it  is
             precisely because societal values as expressed in the criminal
             law  have  been  disregarded  by  the  offender.   And   while
             rehabilitation must take its proper place, that  is  precisely
             because either there  was  no  integration  in  society,  thus
             explaining the commission of  the  offence,  or  because  such
             integration was expunged by commission of the offence.
             [55] besides rehabilitation,  the  sentence  also  serves  the
             essential purpose of  retribution,  which  aims  to  make  the
             offender pay for his crime and is proportionate to the gravity
             of the offence, expressed here by the penalty of imprisonment.
             These functions cannot  operate  to  negate  each  other.  The
             rehabilitative function cannot result in a situation  where  a
             period spent atoning for the  crime  committed  confers  on  a
             convicted person a right the  acquisition  of  which  requires
             recognition  and  acceptance  of  social   values   which   he
             specifically disregarded by committing his criminal act.

   24. Advocate General Bot's opinion expresses his view on integration and
       criminal  acts  in  the  course  of  proceedings  to  determine  the
       acquisition of residence for the purposes of determining  the  level
       of protection acquired. This is reflected in the Court judgments  in
       Onuekwere, MG and PI. None of these cases was considering the  issue
       of 'integration' as a consideration to be taken into account  before
       taking a relevant decision.  Length  of  residence  and  social  and
       cultural integration are matters  that  are  clearly  stipulated  as
       requiring  consideration.  Assessment  of  whether  a   person   has
       residence in excess of 10 years, permanent residence or not requires
       consideration of the length  of  residence  as  defined  in  and  in
       accordance  with  the  calculations  referred  to  in  MG,  PI   and
       Onuekwere. Thereafter the  level  of  protection  is  determined  in
       accordance with regulation 21;  the  weight  to  be  placed  on  the
       considerations and principles set out in regulation 21(5) and (6) is
       a matter to be assessed in the context of the  level  of  protection
       acquired by the person the subject of the expulsion order.



   25. Essa [2013] UKUT 00316  (IAC),  which  predated  MG  and  Onuekwere,
       considers the level  of  protection  afforded  to  Mr  Essa  in  his
       circumstances and acknowledges that in the light of the  anticipated
       reporting of MG and Onuekwere, the guidance given  may  need  to  be
       revised. In [20] the Upper  Tribunal  comment  (in  considering  the
       level of protection to be afforded to Mr Essa) that they could


             "find no indication in the evidence that he has ceased  to  be
             integrated in the United Kingdom".


       Under the sub-heading "the duty to  facilitate  rehabilitation"  the
       Upper Tribunal observes that  in  Tsakouridis  the  term  "genuinely
       integrated" was used to describe


             "those  for  whom  the  prospects  of  rehabilitation  were  a
             relevant issue in the assessment of the balance"


       and went on to hold [26] that the ECJ's


             "...reference to  genuine  integration  must  be  directed  at
             qualified persons and their family members who have resided in
             the host state as such for five years or more. People who have
             just arrived in the host state, have not yet become  qualified
             persons, or have not been a qualified person for  five  years,
             can always be removed for non-exercise of free movement rights
             irrespective of public good grounds to curtail  free  movement
             rights. If their  presence  during  this  time  makes  them  a
             present threat to public policy it would be inconsistent  with
             the purposes of the Directive to weigh in the balance  against
             deportation their future prospects of rehabilitation.
             [27] if they achieve rehabilitation on their return  to  their
             state of origin with whom they have not yet  lost  links  then
             they can always go on to apply to revoke the deportation order
             against them that would otherwise prevent them exercising free
             movement rights in the host state in the future."


       They go on to say [29] that they


             "...do not need to explore the difficult  questions  that  may
             arise at the periphery of the decided case.
             [30] The problem area concerns those EEA nationals  and  their
             family members who have been resident in the  host  state  for
             five years or more but who have not been engaging in  activity
             that makes them a qualified person  for  a  continuous  period
             during that period. They may have resided in  the  host  state
             for many years beyond the minimum five years  and  achieved  a
             substantial degree of integration there and  loss  of  contact
             with their state of origin. We will reserve  the  question  of
             whether the prospects of rehabilitation can  be  a  factor  in
             these cases for future consideration."


   26. Questions of integration have been addressed in the  cases  referred
       to above with regard to the level of protection acquired rather than
       rather than as part of the consideration to be undertaken  prior  to
       the taking of a relevant decision. The Court in Onuekwere  does  not
       adopt the statement of Advocate  General  Bot  that  integration  is
       expunged on commission  of  criminal  offences.  [26]  of  Onuekwere
       refers to the  imposition  of  a  prison  sentence  as  showing  non
       compliance with  societal  values  but  that  is  not  the  same  as
       expunging integration. In any event Advocate General Bot  refers  to
       periods of imprisonment and 'integration to a limited extent'.


   27. Regulation 21(6) has  a  clear  requirement  for  an  assessment  of
       integration, such assessment not merely being  for  the  purpose  of
       determining the level of protection to be afforded. It may of course
       be that the extent and  nature  of  criminality  has  a  significant
       bearing on the outcome of such  an  assessment,  but  that  is  very
       different to determining that criminality expunges integration. Were
       that the case we are satisfied that the Regulations would  not  have
       specifically referred to the requirement to assess integration as  a
       specific element to be undertaken when deciding whether  to  take  a
       relevant decision ie to deport an individual.

   28. Turning to rehabilitation, Advocate General Bot in  his  opinion  in
       Onuekwere refers to the rehabilitative  element  of  sentencing  but
       states that this cannot result in a situation where atonement for  a
       crime confers rights "the acquisition of which requires  recognition
       and acceptance of social values which he specifically disregarded by
       committing his criminal act", although this is not adopted in  terms
       by the Court.

   29. Essa reiterates that

             [32] ...a candidate  for  EEA  deportation  must  represent  a
             present threat by reason of a propensity to  re-offend  or  an
             unacceptably high risk of re-offending.  In  such  a  case  if
             there is acceptable evidence of rehabilitation, the  prospects
             of  future  rehabilitation  do  not  enter  the  balance  save
             possibly  as  future  protective  factors   to   ensure   that
             rehabilitation remains durable.
             [33]  It  is  only  where  rehabilitation  is  incomplete   or
             uncertain that future prospects may play a role in the overall
             assessment....It is in the interests of the citizen, the  host
             state and the  Union  itself  for  an  offender  to  cease  to
             offend....
             [34] If the very factors that contribute  to  his  integration
             that assist in rehabilitation of such offenders  (family  ties
             and  responsibilities,  accommodation,  education,   training,
             employment, active membership of a  community  and  the  like)
             will assist in the completion of a process of  rehabilitation,
             then that can be a substantial factor in the balance.  If  the
             claimant   cannot   constitute   a   present    threat    when
             rehabilitated, and is well advanced  in  rehabilitation  in  a
             host state where there is a substantial degree of integration,
             it may well  very  well  be  disproportionate  to  proceed  to
             deportation.
             [35] At the other end of the scale, if there are no reasonable
             prospects for rehabilitation, the claimant is a present threat
             and is likely to remain  so  for  the  indefinite  future,  we
             cannot  see  how  the  prospects   of   rehabilitation   could
             constitute a significant factor in the balance...."

   30.  Advocate  General  Bot  does  not  support  the  proposition   that
       rehabilitation is irrelevant, rather that it is a factor which  will
       to a greater or lesser degree impact  on  the  decision  made.  Essa
       clearly considers that rehabilitation  is  to  be  considered  as  a
       factor and the weight to be placed upon it being fact specific.  The
       relevance of rehabilitation will be part of an assessment of factors
       overall including the nature of the criminal offence  and  sentence.
       This includes consideration of the impact on the Union as a whole.


   31. The Regulations do not  exclude  the  concept  of  integration  when
       considering expulsion measures against those  who  have  the  lowest
       level of protection. The issue remains a  matter  to  be  considered
       albeit the  weight  to  be  placed  upon  the  various  elements  in
       regulation 21(6) will vary depending upon the  level  of  protection
       acquired prior to a decision to expel being taken.


   32. In summary therefore, we extract the following principles:


        a) Regulation 21(6) requires an assessment of the level and  extent
           of an individual's integration into the host Member State  which
           of necessity requires consideration of the  offending  behaviour
           irrespective of the level of protection being afforded.
        b) An assessment of rehabilitation is  a  relevant  factor  in  the
           proportionality balance as to whether deportation  is  justified
           (Essa 3, 4 and 5 confirmed).


   33.  The  parties  are  agreed  that  the  issue  before   us   is   the
       proportionality of the decision. The claimant has been  lawfully  in
       the UK since the age of five and has,  since  the  age  of  16  been
       involved in criminality of increasing seriousness;  it  is  accepted
       that  he  remains  a  present  threat.  The  matters   relevant   to
       proportionality include those set out in paragraphs 3  to  7  above.
       Although the First-tier Tribunal found that  the  claimant  had  not
       accepted full responsibility for his actions and  had  not  attended
       formal courses addressing offending behaviour, this has now  altered
       to a certain extent as set out  in  the  letter  from  his  offender
       manager (set out at paragraph 5 above). That letter  reiterates  the
       extent of the effect on the victim and his  children  and  expresses
       the view that the claimant's resolve to change his lifestyle will be
       severely tested/challenged upon release.


   34. The claimant is now almost 21  years  old.  His  criminality  became
       increasingly serious, culminating in August 2012  in  his  detention
       following convictions for  the  first  time  for  a  nasty  robbery.
       Previous attempts to deal with his criminality by  way  of  referral
       orders,  attendance  centre  orders,  youth  rehabilitation  orders,
       supervision  and  fines  were  patently  unsuccessful.   His  family
       attempted to deal with his aberrant behaviour in 2011 prior  to  the
       robbery, by sending him to family  in  Somaliland,  a  country  with
       which he was unfamiliar and for which he had developed no  affection
       or ties. Although  he  has  not  acquired  higher  level  protection
       rights, it was accepted by the respondent that the claimant was  and
       has been lawfully in the UK since the age of five.

   35. Although his increasing criminality and in particular  the  offences
       of robbery committed after extended efforts  by  the  youth  justice
       system to enable him to address and cease  offending  behaviour  are
       serious indicators of the level of integration  in  UK  society,  we
       have taken into account the fact that he  has  spent  virtually  the
       whole of his life here in the  UK  other  than  some  11  months  in
       Somaliland and the first five years of his life.  Those  five  years
       would not have impacted significantly  upon  his  awareness  of  the
       country in which he was then  residing  given  the  dependence  upon
       close family at that age  and  the  lack  of  awareness  of  outside
       factors (see for example Azimi-Moayed and  others  [2013]  UKUT  197
       (IAC). We are satisfied that prior to age 16 the  claimant's  centre
       of home, social, educational and cultural life was centred in and an
       integral part of his life in  the  UK.  The  escalating  criminality
       since then is a strong indication of a rejection of the  social  and
       cultural mores of this society but it cannot, given  the  length  of
       time he has been in the UK prior to this  completely  eradicate  his
       links and ties to  the  UK  and  his  integration.  We  are  however
       satisfied that the criminality does reduce the weight to be given to
       his lengthy residence and level of integration.


   36. In so far as rehabilitation is concerned it  does  appear  that  the
       offender manager has  reached  conclusions  that  he  has  now  made
       positive steps to address  his  offending,  that  he  has  a  highly
       supportive family and he  has  evinced  an  overall  willingness  to
       cooperate with his licence and conditions imposed She  does  however
       state that his resolve will be severely tested and this is a  factor
       which has weighed heavily with us in determining the proportionality
       of exclusion.

   37. We do accept the submission that the claimant is unlikely to be able
       to  access  rehabilitation  facilities  in  the   Netherlands.   The
       documentary evidence placed before us  does  not  show  a  means  of
       accessing such processes; the claimant has no  remaining  family  in
       the Netherlands; he has  in  reality  no  links  or  ties  with  the
       Netherlands having lived there only as a very young child  with  his
       family and he does not speak Dutch.

   38. Although previous rehabilitative attempts have failed, as  evidenced
       by his continued and increasingly serious criminality, we have taken
       account of the offender manager's  statement  that  he  "is  a  more
       sombre young man than the one" she  wrote  a  report  on  18  months
       earlier. The issue of rehabilitation is an issue not merely for  the
       claimant but  also  for  the  Union  as  a  whole.  The  concept  of
       rehabilitation carries with it the question "rehabilitating to what"
       and in this particular claimant's case that must mean rehabilitation
       to live a non criminal life in the UK,  the  country  of  his  home,
       where all his family are, where all the important and critical  ties
       in his life are, despite being a citizen of the Netherlands.

   39. Taking all of these factors together and  placing  considerable  and
       strong weight on the claimant's increasing criminality and  that  he
       remains as a person who is assessed  as  posing  a  medium  risk  of
       reoffending and a high risk of harm, we conclude that on balance his
       exclusion would be disproportionate.

   40. We therefore dismiss the SSHD's appeal.


          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     We set aside the decision

    We re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing  the  Secretary  of
    State's appeal thus Mr Madar's appeal against the decision to expel him
    is allowed.


    Anonymity


    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  No
    application to make such an order was made to us and we see  no  reason
    to make such an order.
