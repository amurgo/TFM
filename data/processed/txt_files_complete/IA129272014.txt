                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 26th February 1972.  The
    Appellant claimed to have entered the United Kingdom twelve  years  and
    ten months prior to the date of her EEA4 application.  On 8th  December
    2013 she was issued with a residence card and on 30th December 2013 she
    sought a permanent residence card.

 2. The Secretary of State issued a Notice  of  Refusal  on  28th  February
    2014.  The Secretary of State noted that the Appellant has  applied  as
    the non-European Economic Area national family member  of  Irfan  Majid
    Mughal, a German national, who claimed to have exercised treaty  rights
    for a continuous  period  of  five  years  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    accordance with the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  The Notice  of
    Refusal  considered  that  the  Appellant  had  provided   insufficient
    evidence of her EEA family member's current economic  activity  in  the
    United Kingdom and therefore concluded that the Appellant had failed to
    provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate  that  the  Appellant's  EEA
    family member was economically active in the United Kingdom as a  self-
    employed person as detailed under Regulation 6 of the 2006  Regulations
    for a continuous period of five years.   Consequently  the  application
    was refused with reference to Regulation 15(1)(b)  of  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 3. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Herwald sitting at Manchester on 23rd July  2014.   In  a
    determination promulgated on 13th August 2014 Judge  Herwald  dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal.

 4. On 22nd August 2014 the Appellant lodged Grounds of Appeal to the Upper
    Tribunal.  On 26th September 2014 First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grimmett
    granted  permission  to  appeal.   Judge  Grimmett   noted   that   the
    application to appeal asserted that the judge had erred due to  a  lack
    of proper  reasoning.   As  the  judge  had  accepted  the  Appellant's
    evidence that the Sponsor was a self-employed  businessman  in  the  UK
    (paragraph 22) as set out in her witness statement, but did not  accept
    the  Sponsor's  evidence  that  he  was  a  self-employed   businessman
    (paragraph 27), Judge Grimmett considered that  it  was  arguable  that
    there was a lack of reasoning in the determination.

 5. On 13th October 2014 the Secretary of Sate responded to the Grounds  of
    Appeal under  Rule  24.   That  response  stated  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was entitled to conclude that the Sponsor was not  self-
    employed and hence did not meet the requirements of Regulation 6.  They
    contend that as set out at paragraph 26 of the determination there  was
    clearly no evidence before the judge to show that the Sponsor was self-
    employed.  It was submitted that the  Sponsor  may  well  be  receiving
    working tax credit and child tax credit, however it was not known  what
    documents were submitted to the Department  of  Work  and  Pensions  to
    enable him to make such claims and to receive those benefits.  The Rule
    24 response pointed out that the Appellant was put on notice by way  of
    the  refusal  letter  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor's current economic activities in the UK and that at the  appeal
    there was a paucity of evidence.  The Secretary of State contended that
    it was obvious from the  determination  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge did not accept that the Sponsor was exercising treaty  rights  in
    the UK and submitted that there was no ambiguity  or  contradiction  in
    the determination.

 6. This appeal first came before me to determine whether or nor there  was
    a material error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge.  The issue in this matter is narrow and  highly  technical.   It
    was the contention of both sides that if the Sponsor  is  found  to  be
    self-employed and exercising  therefore  his  treaty  rights  that  the
    appeal should succeed.  It was the contention of  Mr  Timpson  that  at
    paragraph 22 of the determination the judge  accepted  the  Appellant's
    evidence and the assertion of the Sponsor to the  effect  that  he  has
    earned no more than ï¿½7,546 in total  over  the  past  five  years.   He
    stated that that cannot sit with the finding at paragraph 27  that  the
    Appellant is pursuing activity as a self-employed person.

 7. I agreed that those two findings did not sit well together.  It is  for
    the Appellant however to show that he is exercising treaty  rights  and
    the Appellant and his legal representatives were well aware of the very
    strong challenges that  were  made  to  the  Sponsor's  self-employment
    status as set out both in the Notice of Refusal and in Judge  Herwald's
    determination.  In  the  interests  of  justice  bearing  in  mind  the
    contradiction  to  be  found  in  the   First-tier   Tribunal   Judge's
    determination and the fact that both  legal  representatives  urged  me
    that there may well be considerable merit  in  the  rehearing  of  this
    matter bearing in mind  there  is  no  decided  authority  as  to  what
    constitutes self-employment and that the guidance of the Upper Tribunal
    would be useful I set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    reserved the matter to myself and set out directions for the  rehearing
    of this matter.

 8. The matter reappeared  before  me  on  17th  March  2015.   Documentary
    evidence in support of the contentions on behalf of the  Appellant  had
    been served late and the Secretary of State required time  to  consider
    them.  In the interests of justice I agreed  an  adjournment  and  gave
    appropriate directions for the restored hearing of this matter.  It  is
    on that basis that the appeal comes back before me.  The  Secretary  of
    State appears by her Home Office Presenting Officer Mr McVeety and  the
    Appellant  by  her  instructed  Counsel   Mr   Timpson.    Both   legal
    representatives have considerable  experience  of  this  matter  having
    attended before me when I found there was a material error of law.

 9. I am considerably assisted in this matter by the concession now made by
    Mr McVeety on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State  that  the  documents
    produced particularly within the bundles dated 6th March 2015  and  the
    bundle following the subsequent directions of 8th  April  2015  of  the
    Secretary of State's acceptance that  the  Appellant's  Sponsor,  is  a
    German citizen exercising his treaty rights in  the  UK  and  is  self-
    employed and trading as Mughal Autos.

Findings

10. I have had the opportunity to give due consideration to  the  documents
    produced in particular the witness statement of 7th April  2015  of  Mr
    Mughal and the attachments thereto and have heard the concessions  made
    by  Mr  McVeety  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State.   In   such
    circumstances it is clear from the documentation that Mr  Mughal  is  a
    German citizen; that he is exercising treaty rights and that he is self
    employed within  the  UK  trading  as  Mughal  Motors.   Therefore  the
    Appellant is entitled to a residence card.

11. He is operating a self-employed business.  The level of success of that
    business is not a relevant feature and I accept that the  Appellant  is
    entitled to a permanent residence card as confirmation of her right  of
    residence within the United Kingdom pursuant to the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 and  that  it  can  be  concluded  to  the  Tribunal's
    satisfaction that the Appellant's Sponsor is self-employed  within  the
    terms meant both under EU Law generally and paragraph  4  of  the  2006
    Regulations.

Notice of Decision

The Appellant's appeal is therefore  allowed  pursuant  to  the  Immigration
(EEA) Regulations 2006.

No anonymity direction is made.
