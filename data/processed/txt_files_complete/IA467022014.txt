Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Saini, instructed by Legal Rights Partnership
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a national of India was last granted leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom on 17 July 2012, for  a  period  extending  until  6
    August 2015.  In 2014 he left the United Kingdom, his  leave  remaining
    in force.  On his return on 24 November 2014 his leave was cancelled by
    an officer citing and relying on paragraph 321A  of  the  Statement  of
    Changes in Immigration Rules, HC  395  (as  amended).    The  appellant
    appealed, unsuccessfully, and was refused permission to appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  The latter decision was successfully challenged  by  a
    claim for judicial review, following which he was granted permission.

 2. The basis of the officer's action was  that  the  appellant's  previous
    grant of leave was obtained by misrepresentations.  But paragraph  321A
    makes clear by its wording that the grounds for  cancellation  have  to
    relate to the leave which is being cancelled, that is, the leave  which
    is in force, the present leave, not any previous leave.  That  view  is
    endorsed in Khaliq, a decision of this Tribunal, and Amanov, a decision
    of Green J.

 3. In the circumstances Mr Dellar did  not  seek  to  raise  any  vigorous
    opposition to the grounds.

 4. We note, however, that our allowing the appeal should not be  taken  of
    itself to indicate  that  the  appellant  has  current  leave.   As  we
    understand the matter, if the decision under appeal  is  reversed,  his
    leave has nevertheless  expired:  we  were  not  invited  to  determine
    whether s 3D of the 1971 Act should be read to include cancellation  of
    leave, a concept not apparent on its face.

 5. The appellant's appeal is allowed.
