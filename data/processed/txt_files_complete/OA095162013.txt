For the Appellant: Mr M Mohzan (Solicitor, Eurasia Legal Services)
For the Respondent: Mr N Smart (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant, who was born on the 4th of September 1993 and is a
   national of Pakistan, applied on the 4th of February 2013 to enter the UK
   as an adult dependent relative. The application was refused as it was not
   accepted that the Appellant met the requirements of paragraph EC-DR of
   Appendix FM, the reasons are given in the Refusal Notice of the 2nd of
   April 2013. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal by Notice
   and Grounds of Appeal of the 12th of April 2013.

2. The appeal was heard by Judge Sangha at Birmingham on the 7th of
   February 2014. In a determination promulgated on the 12th of March 2014
   the appeal under the Immigration Rules was dismissed but was allowed
   under article 8 on the basis that his exclusion from the UK would be
   disproportionate. The reasoning is considered below.

3. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal
   in an application for permission of the 21st of March 2014. It was
   submitted that the Judge had not applied the approach set out in Gulshan
   (Article 8 - new rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC)  and had
   not identified compelling or exceptional circumstances in the Appellant's
   case and the Appellant's circumstances did not meet the test laid down in
   Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31 and the need for more than the usual
   dependency between adults. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal
   Judge Brunnen on the 23rd of April 2014.

4. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal the Home Office relied on the
   case of Shahzad (Article 8: legitimate aim) Pakistan [2014] UKUT 85 (IAC)
   and referred to paragraph (vi) of the head note.  NH (India) [2007 EWCA
   Civ 1330 related to paragraph 317 and was on the basis that the Appellant
   there had almost satisfied the rules, in this case there was nothing
   exceptional.

5. For the Appellant it was submitted that they had applied for entry
   clearance before but had been refused, now the Appellant's father's
   earnings were sufficient. The Appellant was dependent on his family and
   they had entry clearance, they should not be separated and lived in a
   different cultural system. Family life did not end abruptly at 18, the
   Judge had looked at it in the round and the conclusion reached was open
   to him.

6. At the hearing I indicated that I was satisfied that the determination
   was flawed by an error of law and that on the evidence the finding was
   not open to the Judge. I indicated that I was minded to dismiss the
   appeal but would hear submissions on the final disposal of the appeal. An
   application by the Appellant's representatives for an adjournment to
   provide further evidence was refused. Upper Tribunal directions had
   indicated that if it was intended to adduce further evidence then that
   should have available at the hearing. In any event the Appellant's
   position under article 8 would have to be assessed at the date of the
   decision and changes in circumstances since then could not be considered.

7. After a short adjournment at Mr Mohzan's request to collect his thoughts
   he declined to make any further submissions on the Appellant's case
   stating that I had indicated that I had made up my mind and so he did not
   seek to persuade me despite the opportunity being given. In the absence
   of submissions from the Appellant the Home Office were not called on to
   reply.

8. The basic facts that the Judge had to consider were that the Appellant
   was born on the 4th of September 1993 and at the date of the application
   was about 19� years old, and not much older at the date of the decision.
   He was fit and healthy adult who was either a qualified mechanic or was
   about to become one. He was living with those members of his family who
   lived in Pakistan and beyond his mother and siblings, his grandparents
   and other relatives still live there.

9. It was accepted that the Appellant could not meet the requirements of
   paragraph EC-DR and E-ECDR.2.5 of Appendix FM which cover what an adult
   dependent relative would have to show in order to be entitled to entry
   clearance. To have met those requirements he would have had to show that
   as a result of age, illness or disability he required long-term personal
   care to perform everyday tasks. There is no suggestion that the Appellant
   is in need of such care.

10. Gulshan and Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) were considered in Shahzad
   (Article 8: legitimate aim) Pakistan [2014] UKUT 316 (IAC) where the
   approach the approach to be taken was set out again. Where the rules
   constitute a complete code then no further consideration is required, it
   is only if the rules are not a complete code and there may be good
   arguable grounds for granting leave outside them is it necessary to
   consider if there are compelling circumstances not sufficiently
   recognised by the rules.

11. The Judge was right to find that the Appellant did not meet the
   requirements of the rules. reliance on the cases cited in paragraph 21,
   and on NH in particular was inapt, those were decisions under the old
   paragraph 317 and the reasoning in NH in particular relied on the extent
   to which the Appellant was close to the requirements but could not meet
   them. That could be analogous to a near miss approach which has been
   strongly disapproved.

12. I am not satisfied that the rules in this regard can be regarded as a
   complete code as submitted by Mr Smart. There is no provision within this
   part of Appendix FM for the consideration of exceptional circumstances
   and so the approach in part (vi) of Shahzad can be taken. However,
   consideration of article 8 issues arises only if there are arguably good
   grounds for granting leave where there are compelling circumstances
   outside the rules.

13. The Judge's principal findings are set out in paragraphs 22 and 23 of
   the determination. At the date of the decision the Appellant was studying
   to be a mechanic living at home with his mother, siblings and
   grandparents. The Appellant spent time with his siblings, playing and
   eating together and that separation would have a considerable impact on
   them.

14. There is nothing in those circumstances that can be regarded as being
   remotely unusual, demanding or compelling. The situation that they face
   is one brought about by the family members in Pakistan desire to live in
   the UK. The Judge's does not reflect the separation of the family already
   brought about by the decision of the Sponsor to locate himself in the UK,
   away from his family or the effect of the departure of the family from
   Pakistan on the grandparents.

15. The factors in paragraph 23 do not take the matter further. The age of
   the Appellant is allowed for in the rules and the observation that he was
   not "far beyond" the age of 18 is close to a near miss but also
   inaccurate, he was 19� when he applied so some way into adult hood. I
   accept that family life does not stop abruptly at 18 but may continue
   beyond but the circumstances set out in the determination fell a long way
   short of the ties of more than usual strength envisaged in Kugathas.

16. While the contents of the rules relating to adult dependent relatives
   are not a complete code and do not preclude considerations of factors
   outside the rules there was nothing in the circumstances of the Appellant
   and his family that justified such a step being taken in this case. For
   the reasons given above I find that Judge Sangha erred in his approach to
   the Appellant's circumstances and article 8.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making
of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision and I re-make the
decision in the appeal dismissing the appeal of Muhammad Tayyab.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

Fee Award

In dismissing the appeal I make no fee award.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
