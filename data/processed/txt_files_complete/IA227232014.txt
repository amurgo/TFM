                               MOIZUDDIN AHMED
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION not made)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No representation


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the respondent's appeal in the  case  of  Moizuddin  Ahmed.  He
    appealed against the decision of the Secretary of State on 12 May  2014
    which refused his application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant  and  directed  his  removal  to
    India.

2.   That appeal was dealt with by the First-tier  Tribunal  on  5  February
    2015 and was successful in terms of the Immigration Rules, there  being
    no appearance by either party.

3.   It transpires though that the appellant actually left the country on  3
    January 2015 and prior to that had indicated that he wished formally to
    withdraw his appeal application.  It would appear that no one including
    the respondent was aware that this was the case.

4.   It follows that both from his formal withdrawal of the appeal and as  a
    matter of law from Section 104(4) of the 2002 Act that the  appeal  has
    been abandoned. Therefore the First-tier Tribunal had  no  jurisdiction
    to deal with the matter.  This is a separate appeal against  an  appeal
    which should never have been  allowed.   We  do  have  jurisdiction  to
    entertain this matter.  We allow the appeal of the respondent  and  set
    aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal which should  never  have
    been made in the first place.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
