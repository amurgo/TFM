For the Appellant:     Ms V. Templeton, Duncan Lewis Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

This has been a remote hearing  which  has  not  been  objected  to  by  the
parties.  The form of remote hearing was V (video). A face to  face  hearing
was not held because it  was  not  practicable,  and  all  issues  could  be
determined in a remote hearing.

The documents that I was referred to are in  bundles  totalling  326  pages,
the contents of which I have recorded.

The order made is described at the end of these reasons.

The parties said this about the process: they were content that the  hearing
had been conducted fairly.  Ms Templeton was  unable  to  access  the  video
link but was able to dial in via Skype for Business and participate  in  the
hearing that way.  She was content  that  the  hearing  had  been  conducted
fairly, notwithstanding the hardware difficulties experienced.

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Fowell promulgated on 16 January 2020 dismissing the appellant's appeal
    against a decision of the respondent dated 12 March 2019 to refuse  his
    asylum claim. The appellant is a citizen of China, born on 3 June 1999.
    He is now 20 years old. He arrived in the UK by plane aged 15  and  was
    encountered working in a Chinese restaurant. On 7 September 2015 he was
    recognised by the competent authority to be a victim of trafficking, in
    a positive conclusive grounds decision.  He was  granted  discretionary
    leave until he was 17 and a half and placed in the care of  the  county
    council, through which he was housed by foster carers.

 2. On 28 November 2016, the appellant claimed asylum on the basis that  he
    would be at risk of being re-trafficked.   The  claim  was  refused  in
    circumstances which were initially thought not to attract  a  right  of
    appeal.  Judicial review proceedings followed, with the result that the
    respondent took a further decision, on 12 March 2019, which did attract
    a right of appeal.  That appeal was heard by Judge Fowell,  and  it  is
    that decision which is under challenge in these proceedings.

Factual background

 3. The appellant's case is that he was trafficked to this country  by  his
    mother to work.  His journey was facilitated by  an  agent,  who  dealt
    with passport control at border  here.   He  was  made  to  work  in  a
    restaurant for �20 a day.  He claimed asylum after being apprehended by
    the authorities.  The appellant's case is that he has no  contact  with
    his mother or any other family in China, and that,  in  any  event,  he
    remains at risk from his mother, given was responsible for  trafficking
    him to this country.  In an earlier decision, dated  28  October  2015,
    the respondent accepted that the appellant  would  not  enjoy  adequate
    reception  facilities  in  China,  and  granted   him   leave   as   an
    unaccompanied minor on that basis.

 4. In her decision of 12 March 2019, the respondent considered that, given
    the appellant is now an adult, it would be possible for him  to  return
    to China.  It is a vast country, the respondent noted, with sufficiency
    of protection for former victims of trafficking.  Not only was there no
    suggestion that either his mother, or the  agent  who  facilitated  his
    travel to this country, were or sought  to  be  in  contact  with  him,
    internal relocation would be a feasible alternative.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. Judge Fowell found that the appellant had not been trafficked  to  this
    country.  He noted the decision of  the  competent  authority  dated  7
    September 2015 accepted the appellant to be a  victim  of  trafficking,
    but observed that that decision formed part of the background materials
    and did not tie his hands, adding  that  the  role  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was to arrive at its own decision.  The appellant's case  that
    he was a victim of trafficking  was  partly  predicated  on  his  wider
    narrative that he has no contact with his mother, who  was  responsible
    for his trafficking.  The judge found  that  the  social  care  records
    submitted on behalf of the appellant revealed a different picture [43].
     Although he did not set out the date of the extract, at [28] the judge
    had quoted extensively from one of the appellant's care plans.  One  of
    the excerpts stated:

         "[The appellant] says that he keeps in touch with his mother over a
         social media... it is important that [he] is able to  have  contact
         with his mother."

    The above extract appears to be from a review dated 21  May  2015  (FTT
    bundle page 26).

 6. The judge found that the above  extract  fundamentally  undermined  the
    appellant's  case,  and  the  operative  assumption  of  the  competent
    authority and the social workers, that  he  had  no  contact  with  his
    mother.  At [44] the judge suggested that his foster parents must  have
    known about the ongoing contact by the appellant with his  mother,  but
    that they had not mentioned it, "no doubt taking the view that to do so
    would be unhelpful and undermine [the appellant's] position."

 7. The conflict between the  appellant's  trafficking  narrative  and  the
    single entry in the undated care records quoted by  the  judge  "placed
    matters  in  a  very  different  light",  making   it   "difficult   to
    reconcile... with the account  given  of  a  neglectful  and  traumatic
    upbringing...."  An account the  appellant  had  given  to  Dr  Arnsby-
    Wilson, a clinical psychologist, was  similarly  defective,  found  the
    judge.

 8. The judge also had  concerns  about  the  positive  way  in  which  the
    appellant recounted to Dr Arnsby-Wilson his  dealings  as  a  with  his
    "traffickers".  The account the appellant gave was  that  they  treated
    him well, they did not hurt him, and were  like  friends:  [47].   That
    suggested that the appellant was not imprisoned,  nor  was  he  working
    against his will, and the work would have  enabled  him  to  send  some
    money back to China immediately: [48].  The judge said  that  Secretary
    of State "will not have been provided with the care records  indicating
    that he was still in contact with his mother" [49].  At [54] the  judge
    said,

         "Victims of trafficking are often young women or  girls  and  maybe
         returning with a baby. They will encounter social stigma. There may
         be a violent response from a  father.  They  may  not  be  able  to
         support themselves financially or support  their  baby  and  so  be
         forced back into prostitution. None of these  concerns  appears  to
         apply here."

 9. There would be no risk on return, found the judge.   He  dismissed  the
    appeal.

Submissions

10. The grounds of appeal contend that the judge erred in his assessment of
    whether the appellant was  a  victim  of  trafficking,  by  failing  to
    conduct the assessment by reference to the  definition  of  trafficking
    contained in Article 3 of the Palermo Protocol to  the  United  Nations
    Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The  grounds  contend
    that the consent of the victim, whether or not the  victim  is  treated
    "well" by the traffickers, and the fact he  was  paid  a  modest  (�20)
    salary for his  work  cannot  detract  from  a  trafficking  situation.
    Further, the judge speculated at [49] when stating that  the  Secretary
    of State had not been provided  with  the  social  care  records.   The
    judge's definition of trafficking at [54] was simplistic and incorrect.

11. Secondly, the grounds contend that the judge made a  mistake  of  fact,
    resulting in speculation and irrationality, when analysing  the  social
    care records. Although the judge quoted at [28]  an  extract  from  the
    social care records which appeared to suggest the appellant remained in
    contact with his family, he did not mention, and therefore appeared  to
    overlook, a later entry which stated that "[the appellant] did not want
    to talk about contact with his family and it was agreed that this would
    not be raised at each meeting as [the appellant] finds it  distressing.
    [The appellant] has had contact with family via social media  currently
    does not wish to." The grounds contend that the judge did not raise his
    concerns about the foster carers' knowledge concerning the  appellant's
    contact with his family, nor did the presenting officer raise  concerns
    on that basis. It was also an error, contend the grounds, for the judge
    to extrapolate the significance of the appellant remaining  in  contact
    with his mother  to  a  position  which  fundamentally  undermined  the
    appellant's case. Plainly, contend the grounds, the appellant's  mother
    would want to maintain some contact with him, having trafficked him  to
    this country, for the purposes of her gain.

12. The grounds also contend that the judge failed to consider the  country
    guidance materials submitted, although this is not particularised.

Discussion

13. At the hearing before me, Mr Walker conceded that the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law. That was  a
    realistic concession,  and  I  find  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal involved the making of an error  of  law,  for  the  following
    reasons.

14. While the judge was correct, in principle, to  note  that  he  was  not
    bound by the conclusive grounds decision by the competent authority, it
    was  incumbent  upon  him  to  (i)  apply  the  correct  definition  of
    trafficking when looking back to ascertain what took place in China and
    following the appellant's initial  arrival  here;  (ii)  to  take  into
    account all relevant evidence when reaching his  own  conclusions;  and
    (iii) not to speculate.

15. Trafficking is defined in the following  terms  in  Article  3  of  the
    Palermo Protocol:

         "For the purposes of this Protocol:

             (a)  "Trafficking in  persons"  shall  mean  the  recruitment,
             transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by
             means of the  threat  or  use  of  force  or  other  forms  of
             coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of  the  abuse
             of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or
             receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of  a
             person having control over another person, for the purpose  of
             exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at  a  minimum,  the
             exploitation of the prostitution of others or other  forms  of
             sexual exploitation, forced labour  or  services,  slavery  or
             practices similar to slavery,  servitude  or  the  removal  of
             organs;

             (b)  The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to  the
             intended exploitation set forth in subparagraph  (a)  of  this
             article shall be irrelevant where any of the means  set  forth
             in subparagraph (a) have been used;

             (c)  The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring  or
             receipt of a child for the purpose of  exploitation  shall  be
             considered "trafficking in persons"  even  if  this  does  not
             involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this
             article;

             (d)  "Child" shall mean any person  under  eighteen  years  of
          age."

16. The sad reality inherent to many trafficking  situations  is  that  the
    victim will be manipulated by  their  traffickers  into  thinking  that
    there is a relationship of some form  of  warmth  between  them.   Many
    traffickers operate in that way.  It is for that  reason  that  Article
    3(b) provides that the consent  of  victims  of  trafficking  shall  be
    irrelevant when any of the means of trafficking set out in Article 3(a)
    have been used.  As a 15  year  old  boy  in  a  foreign  country,  the
    appellant was particularly vulnerable.  His case was that he was forced
    to work for minimum payment.  That  situation  is  capable  of  falling
    squarely within the "recruitment... of persons... by  means  of...  the
    abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability"  under  sub-paragraph
    (a).  That the appellant described the traffickers as being friendly is
    nothing to the point.  Furthermore, where a child is  involved,  it  is
    irrelevant if the means specified in Article 3(a)  are  not  used:  see
    Article 3(c), taken with 3(d).

17. Rather than anchor his analysis to the legal definition of trafficking,
    the judge's only discussion of what a trafficking situation looks  like
    in practice appears to have taken place by reference to the judge's own
    personal opinions about human trafficking, which were nothing more than
    simplistic, stereotypical assumptions, which,  on  the  facts  of  this
    case, were simply incorrect.  See, for example, [47] where the fact the
    traffickers were described by the appellant as treating him well was  a
    basis to call into question "whether he is a victim of  trafficking  at
    all." Similarly, at [54], the judge's  discussion  about  the  risk  of
    onward trafficking  was  characterised  by  inaccurate,  incorrect  and
    stereotypical  assumptions  about  the  profile  of  victims  of  human
    trafficking.  That was an error of law.

18. As noted above, extract from the appellant's care records quoted by the
    judge at [28] appears to be from the appellant's care plan dated 21 May
    2015.  The judge also had before him later care notes.   In  the  entry
    for a subsequent review, conducted on 14  August  2015,  the  following
    featured under the heading Summary of Review Discussion:

         "[Y] did not want to talk about contact with his family and it  was
         agreed that this will not be raised at each meeting as [Y] finds it
         distressing. [Y] has had contact with family via social  media  but
         currently does not wish to."

    The judge did not refer to the above extract. He highlighted an earlier
    extract from one of the  initial  reviews,  viewing  it  in  isolation,
    without considering subsequent developments.  It is not  clear  whether
    the judge considered this entry, and did not mention it, or whether  he
    overlooked it.  Either way, it was incumbent upon the judge to  resolve
    this key factual conflict.   He did not.

19. The judge did not put his concerns arising from the appellant's contact
    with his mother to the parties.  While judges are not required to  give
    running commentary on their likely decisions, where, as here,  a  judge
    resolves a case on a wholly different basis to  that  advanced  by  the
    parties, fairness may require the judge to canvass the new  issue  with
    the parties.  See AM (Fair hearing) Sudan [2015] UKUT 656 (IAC),  which
    states at (v) of the Headnote:

         "Fairness may require a Tribunal to canvas an issue which  has  not
         been  ventilated  by  the  parties  or  their  representatives,  in
         fulfilment of each party's right to a fair hearing."

20. It was common ground between the  parties  that  the  appellant  was  a
    victim of trafficking.  There was no suggestion  at  the  hearing  that
    that was in issue, and consequently neither party addressed  the  judge
    on what was an agreed fact on both sides.  While the judge was entitled
    to depart from the conclusive grounds assessment, given the parties had
    not been given the opportunity to  address  him  on  any  of  the  many
    factual issues that would necessarily arise  from  the  judge  adopting
    that approach, unfairness resulted.

21. That unfairness manifested itself in a number of ways.

22. First, the parties would have been able to address  Judge  Fowell  that
    the crucial evidence upon which he purported to base his departure from
    the  conclusive  grounds  decision  should  not  have  been  viewed  in
    isolation.  There were other social care records which cast the judge's
    conclusion concerning the appellant's contact  with  his  mother  in  a
    different light.

23. Secondly, the parties may  have  been  able  to  address  Judge  Fowell
    concerning the definition of trafficking in Article 3(a) of the Palermo
    Protocol, which could  have  explained  a  degree  of  initial  contact
    between the appellant and his mother - his trafficker - in a  way  that
    the judge simply (and incorrectly) did not consider.

24. As a result, Judge Fowell made mistakes of fact  which  fell  into  the
    following category of errors of fact which may amount to errors of law,
    pursuant to [9(vii)] of R (Iran) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982:

         "Making a mistake as to a material fact which could be  established
         by objective and uncontentious evidence, where the appellant and/or
         his advisers were  not  responsible  for  the  mistake,  and  where
         unfairness resulted from the fact that a mistake was made."

25. Thirdly, had Judge Fowell raised his  concerns  about  the  appellant's
    contact with his mother with the appellant, his foster parents, or with
    his representative, a proper explanation could have been  given,  which
    may have been consistent with the evolving position in the social  care
    records.  Instead, the judge implied  -  quite  wrongly,  unfairly  and
    without foundation - that the foster parents  had  been  dishonest,  in
    possibly deliberately omitting to mention  what  the  judge  speculated
    must have been sustained  and  regular  contact  on  the  part  of  the
    appellant with his mother.

26. It was deeply unfair for Judge Fowell to imply dishonesty on  the  part
    of the appellant's foster parents.   Not  only  had  Judge  Fowell  not
    raised  the  spectre  of  their  dishonesty  as   a   result   of   his
    misunderstanding of the evidence, it was unfair for  him  not  to  give
    them the opportunity to respond to his concerns.

27. Fourthly, the parties could have drawn to Judge Fowell's attention  the
    fact that the appellant's social care records had been submitted to the
    respondent before the 12 March 2019 refusal  decision  was  taken:  see
    paragraph  (y)  on  page  7  of  that  decision.   Significantly,   the
    respondent in that  decision  did  not  seek  to  revisit  the  earlier
    decision of the competent authority in which the appellant was found to
    be a victim of human trafficking, despite having the very care  records
    relied upon by the judge to depart from the earlier competent authority
    decision.

28. Fifthly, the parties could have clarified with the  judge  whether  the
    competent authority had access to the social care records  when  taking
    its positive reasonable grounds decision (1  September  2015)  and  its
    conclusive grounds decision (7 September 2015).  Instead, at  [49]  the
    judge speculated as to which documents had been provided  to  the  Home
    Office.  There is no room for speculation in this jurisdiction.

29. Grounds 1 and 2 are made out.  If the appellant  were  trafficked,  the
    question of his vulnerability to  re-trafficking  must  be  considered.
    That is a question which falls to be addressed not only by reference to
    the  ability  of  the  authorities  in  China  to  protect  victims  of
    trafficking, or the appellant's ability to relocate internally, but  by
    reference to  the  appellant's  own  vulnerabilities  as  a  victim  of
    trafficking (subject to any  properly  reasoned,  evidence  and  fairly
    reached findings of a future tribunal to the contrary).  As such, it is
    necessary for Judge Fowell's decision to be set aside.

30. As I have found Judge Fowell's approach rendered  the  hearing  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal unfair, the only solution is for the matter  to  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, to be heard by a different judge.

31. It is not necessary for me to consider Ground 3, which in any event  is
    inadequately particularised.

Notice of Decision

The decision of Judge Fowell involved the making of an error of law  and  is
set aside in its entirety with no findings of fact preserved.

The matter is to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be reheard  by  a
judge other than Judge Fowell.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
