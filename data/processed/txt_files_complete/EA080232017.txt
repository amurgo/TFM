                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Dr Onipede, instructed by way of Direct Access
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 27th November 1978.

2.   He seeks to appeal against the decision of  the  respondent  dated  4th
    September 2017 refusing his application for a permanent residence  card
    as a confirmation of his right of residence as the family member of  an
    EEA national under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

3.   The hearing of  that  appeal  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Shanahan at the Nottingham Justice Centre on  17  April  2018.  In  the
    decision promulgated on 14th May 2018 the appeal was dismissed.  It was
    the clear finding  of  the  Judge,  having  heard  evidence,  that  the
    appellant was not dependent upon his EEA sponsor in the United Kingdom.
     The sponsor being Mr John Kenneth Ihemedu,  who  was  the  appellant's
    first cousin.

4.   An appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted to challenge that  decision
    on the basis that the Judge had not considered the alternative position
    namely whether the appellant resided  as  a  member  of  the  sponsor's
    household in the United Kingdom.

5.   At a hearing before Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds on  6th  September  2018
    it was accepted that  the  Judge's  failure  to  have  considered  that
    alternative rendered the decision as a whole in error of law.  Thus  it
    was that the decision was set aside to be remade.

6.   It would seem to have been the intention of the Upper Tribunal to  have
    proceeded to deal with that aspect at the same time but Mr  Walker,  on
    behalf of the respondent, sought to adduce  fresh  evidence  which  was
    relevant to the allegation of fraud that had previously been made.  The
    previous determination of Senior Immigration Judge  Storey  promulgated
    on 19th August 2011 was also to be relied upon. No prior  notice  under
    Rule 15(2A) had been given before the hearing and it was not surprising
    therefore that those representing  the  appellant  had  been  taken  by
    surprise.  Thus the matter was adjourned  for  the  legal  advisors  to
    consider the material sought duly presented.

7.   Thus the matter came before me at a hearing several months later.

8.   The material. which was relied upon by Mr Walker in which he  continues
    to rely upon, is set out at Annexes A to H of the respondent's  bundle.
    No objection was taken for that material now to be considered.

9.   The matter is of some complexity and it is  therefore  perhaps  helpful
    to set out the chronology of the matter.

10.  At some stage the appellant entered the United Kingdom unlawfully.

11.  On 26th March 2010 an application was made by the sponsor to  the  Home
    Office for the grant of an EEA residence card to  two  members  of  his
    family namely Daniel Obinna Ihemudu, who was his half-brother, and  the
    appellant said to be his cousin.  Photographs of both  Daniel  and  the
    appellant were attached to the application form.

12.  On 29th October 2010 Daniel was granted an EEA residence card  but  the
    appellant was refused one in a decision of 5th November 2010.

13.  It was not accepted that the appellant was related to  the  sponsor  as
    claimed nor was it accepted that he had resided with that sponsor prior
    to arriving in the United Kingdom and since his arrival, or that he had
    been generally dependent upon that family member.  Further it  was  not
    accepted that the sponsor was a qualified person.

14.  The appellant sought to appeal against that decision.  The appeal  came
    before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Somerville  for  hearing  and  in  a
    determination notified on 21st January 2011  the  appeal  was  allowed.
    The judge found that the appellant and the  sponsor  were  related  and
    that the claimant was residing with the sponsor in the  United  Kingdom
    and was dependent upon him.

15.  The Secretary of State sought to  appeal  against  that  decision  upon
    error of law on the basis that the Judge had failed to make  a  finding
    as to whether the appellant had been dependent upon the  sponsor  prior
    to arrival in the United Kingdom or a member of his household.

16.  The matter  thus  came  before  Senior  Immigration  Judge  Storey  for
    hearing on 16th May 2011.  In effect Judge Storey found there to be  an
    error of law in the First-tier decision and proceeded to  consider  the
    evidence relating to whether the appellant had been dependent upon  the
    sponsor and or residing in his household prior to coming to the  United
    Kingdom.  It was his findings upon detailed reasons that  he  did  not,
    accordingly the appellant's appeal was dismissed.

17.  However in that determination Judge Storey expressed some concern  that
    the  residence  card  was  given  to  Daniel  arising  from  the   same
    application that was made for the appellant.  He invited the  Secretary
    of State to consider carefully  why  there  should  have  been  such  a
    distinction.  Whether as a result of those comments or not, in  fact  a
    residence card was granted to the appellant on 21st February 2013 valid
    until 12th June 2017.

18.  It then came to  the  attention  of  the  respondent  that  Daniel  had
    practised deception upon the authorities, falsely representing  himself
    in that identity as being the half-brother of the sponsor when in  fact
    he admitted that he was a different person with a different name and  a
    different date of birth.  As a result of those matters the decision  of
    17th January 2013 revoked his residence card.   The  relevant  evidence
    that is relied upon is set out in that refusal letter, which was one of
    the documents which Mr Walker  has  sought  to  produce,  the  relevant
    passages are as follows:

         "On 10th December 2012 North London Command Team were  informed  by
         the US authorities that you had been matched by facial  recognition
         systems in the identity of Mr Timidayo Adeshina Olanikawo Nga  born
         28th November 1977.


         When presented with the evidence of facial recognition results  you
         made a full and frank admission to the US authorities when applying
         for a visa to travel to the states.  You confirm that you  took  on
         the identity of Daniel Obinna Ihemedu to apply for a residence card
         in the United Kingdom and it has been confirmed therefore that  you
         have sought leave by deception in a  false  identity.   Whilst  the
         Nigerian passport which you previously presented to the  UK  Border
         Agency appears to have been genuinely issued it has  been  obtained
         by fraudulent means."


19.  As the decision went on

         "As the identity of Daniel Obinna Ihemedu  has  been  found  to  be
         false in the use of purposes  of  deception  it  follows  that  the
         claimed relationship and birth certificates previously presented to
         support your claimed relationship to Mr J K Ihmedu is false and can
         no longer be relied upon."


20.   Thus  it  was  that  when  the  appellant  sought  to  apply  for  his
    application for permanent residence as the extended  family  member  of
    the sponsor, such  deception  was  said  to  have  cast  doubt  on  the
    credibility of the appellant's claimed relationship  with  the  sponsor
    and of his continuing dependency upon him.

21.  At the outset of the hearing I sought to clarify the issues which  were
    at large at the hearing, bearing in mind the requirements  set  out  in
    Regulation 8 of the EEA Regulations to the nature of establishing  what
    was an extended family member.  Regulations were also considered in the
    case of Dauhoo (EEA Regulation - Reg 8(2)) [2012] UKUT 79 (IAC).

22.   It  was  necessary  for  the  appellant  to  establish  dependency  or
    membership of the household of the  sponsor  prior  to  coming  to  the
    United Kingdom, in addition to the requirement that he show  dependency
    or membership of the sponsor's household in the United Kingdom.

23.  In terms of the latter  requirements  no  challenge  was  made  to  the
    findings of Judge Shanahan.  There was no dependency by  the  appellant
    upon the sponsor in the United Kingdom.  That  was  not  the  challenge
    mounted originally nor indeed has there been any  suggestion  that  the
    conclusion of the Judge is in any way in error.  Thus the live issue in
    terms of the UK is whether or not the appellant established,  upon  the
    balance of  probabilities,  that  he  is  a  member  of  the  sponsor's
    household since being in the United Kingdom.

24.  In terms of dependency and or residence with the sponsor before  coming
    to the United Kingdom Dr Onipede sought to argue that that  was  not  a
    relevant matter, given that the residence card had been granted to  the
    appellant, therefore it must be deemed to have  been  accepted  by  the
    respondent that those requirements had been met.  He submits  that  the
    EEA residence card given to  Daniel  was  also  an  acceptance  by  the
    respondent of the prior dependency and or residence.

25.  Given that it is the case  presented  that  the  claim  by  Daniel  was
    fraudulent, it perhaps does not assist materially to  rely  upon  that.
    It was accepted by the respondent that there had been prior  dependence
    or residence. To submit otherwise  is  to  ignore  the  nature  of  the
    original refusal decision so far as  the  appellant  was  concerned  in
    which that matter was specifically challenged and also the findings  of
    Senior Immigration Judge Storey in the determination, now  relied  upon
    by the respondent in the bundle of documents  presented.   I  indicated
    that I considered that it was a live issue to be considered as part  of
    the appeal.

26.  The appellant gave evidence adopting  his  witness  statement  of  14th
    November 2018.

27.  He said that he  entered  the  United  Kingdom  in  December  2008  the
    sponsor was his cousin.  The sponsor's father and his father  had  been
    brothers.  He said of Daniel Obinna Ihemedu that he was also the cousin
    and half-brother of the sponsor being born to a different mother albeit
    to the same father.  The family tree was presented.

28.  He said that in 2002 the sponsor  had  left  Nigeria  for  Belgium  and
    before then he was living together with the sponsor at a flat in  Lagos
    Nigeria.

29.  In 2007 he joined the sponsor in Belgium and lived with him for  almost
    one year.  In 2007 he moved to  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  sponsor
    eventually moved to the United Kingdom some time in 2007.

30.  In 2010 Daniel and himself applied for an EEA  residence  card  on  the
    basis of their relationship with the sponsor.  Daniel's application was
    granted and his was refused.

31.  His statement  continues  that  he  has  continuously  lived  with  the
    sponsor since 2009 until the present day.  Daniel also lived with  them
    from 2009 until 2011 when he moved out to live with  his  fianc�e.   He
    denies any knowledge of the fraud committed by Daniel nor does he  know
    his current whereabouts.

32.  In terms of the oral evidence the appellant said the  original  of  his
    birth certificate was  with  the  Home  Office.   He  produced  various
    affidavits of members of the family as to when they were  born  in  the
    absence of birth certificates in Nigeria.  The sponsor rented the  flat
    for himself and the appellant and from time to time  for  Daniel.   The
    sponsor paid for the flat rent.

33.  He said that when his father died and gone to  live  with  the  sponsor
    rather than his mother who was not able to support him.

34.  He was financially supported by the sponsor  from  Belgium  by  various
    remittances sent to him.  He joined the sponsor in Belgium.

35.  Since coming to the United Kingdom he has resided with the  sponsor  at
    three addresses which he set out.  Again the sponsor pays the rent  and
    gives some support to him financially.

36.  When asked what the sponsor did by way of work he did not  seem  to  be
    very clear but said he worked with various agencies but  was  currently
    working as a fork lift operator storing pallets.

37.  When questioned by Mr Walker, the appellant insisted  that  the  Daniel
    with whom he had made the application, was the Daniel that he had grown
    up with as his cousin.  He did not explain why the Daniel with whom  he
    had made the application should present himself finally in a  different
    identity to the authorities.

38.  He was asked when it was that the sponsor obtained his  citizenship  of
    Belgium but he did not know.

39.  The sponsor Mr John Kenneth Ihemedu also  gave  evidence.   He  adopted
    his statement of 14th  November  2018  indicating  that  as  a  Belgian
    citizen  he  entered  the  United  Kingdom  in  2007  and   had   lived
    continuously since He confirmed that the Appellant was his first cousin
    and that Daniel, the one who had been the subject  of  his  application
    for a residence card, was his half-brother.

40.  Before leaving Nigeria he had been living with the appellant  in  Lagos
    Nigeria.  In 2002 he left Nigeria for Belgium and in 2007 he was joined
    by the appellant in Belgium.  They lived together for one  year  before
    moving to the United Kingdom.

41.  He indicated that he knew nothing about the fraud committed  by  Daniel
    or that he had any other name or identity.

42.  He said in oral evidence that from 2002 to 2004 he  lived  in  Brussels
    and was studying. From 2004 to 2005 he was in Ghent  undertaking  study
    in food sciences and technology.  He was then working  in  Belgium  and
    moved to the UK sometime in 2007 he  was  unable  to  recall  precisely
    when.   He married in Belgium sometime between  2005  and  2006.   When
    pressed as to the  date  of  the  marriage  he  could  not  recall  but
    confirmed that he had remained  married  to  his  wife  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

43.  He could not recall precisely when it was that he obtained his  Belgian
    nationality.

44.  When he first came to the United Kingdom  he  lived  in  Huntingdon  at
    [~].  In 2013 moved to Peterborough living at [~] and in 2017 moved  to
    another area of Peterborough to an address [~].  He said he  had  lived
    there with the appellant throughout all that time.

45.  He was registered for various agencies and did work  supplying  kitchen
    equipment and currently was a fork lift driver.

46.  He confirmed to Mr Walker that he had grown up with Daniel.  I  note  a
    copy of a residence card granted in Belgium was shown to him dated 2008
    and he agreed that that was correct. When  pressed  upon  when  he  had
    moved to the United Kingdom he seemed to remain unclear saying that  he
    may have moved backwards and forth because he got  a  job  in  2008  in
    Huntingdon.

47.  He was asked what the appellant was doing at the time that he left  for
    Belgium in 2002.  He indicated that he could not  remember  whether  he
    was working or studying.  He maintained that whilst in Belgium he  kept
    on the flat in Lagos and paid rent for it and sent money to support the
    appellant.  He was asked what the appellant was doing  in  those  years
    and he indicated that he did not know and was not very clear.   He  was
    asked what the appellant had done in Belgium when he arrived  and  once
    again he did not seem to know, other than saying that the appellant had
    done some work.

48.  In terms of dependency and or  residence  with  the  sponsor  prior  to
    coming to the United Kingdom the important document to consider is  the
    determination of Senior Immigration Judge Storey as  it  was  precisely
    that question which fell for consideration by that  Senior  Judge.   It
    seems to me to be unnecessary to repeat all that is  set  out  in  that
    determination which was part of the evidence presented at the  hearing.
    The conclusion of the judge was that the appellant  did  not  discharge
    the burden upon him of showing either that  he  was  dependent  on  the
    sponsor prior to arrival or that he  was  a  member  of  the  sponsor's
    household prior to arrival.  Applying the principle of  Devaseelan,  it
    is that decision which the starting point for any consideration of  any
    subsequent evidence.

49.  As was noted by the   Judge Storey  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
    sponsor was an EEA national earlier than April 2008, which is the  date
    shown on his Belgian ID  card  also  exhibited  in  the  bundle.    The
    evidence that was given by both appellant and sponsor to the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge differed on the matter as to when the appellant went  to
    Belgium.  The appellant then stating 2008 and the sponsor stating 2007.
     The appellant only admitted to having arrived in  the  United  Kingdom
    illegally under cross-examination.  The  appellant  had  produced  very
    scant documentary evidence to substantiate his and the sponsor's  claim
    about prior connections, such being an energy  bill  made  out  to  the
    sponsor at an address in Lagos in November 2006 and a tenancy agreement
    at the address in Lagos covering 28th October 1999 to 29th October 2001
    naming the appellant and sponsor  as  co-tenants.   There  was  also  a
    document in French identifying the appellant and  sponsor's  co-tenants
    at an address in Belgium in January 2007.

50.  It was noted by Judge Storey that the sponsor in his evidence  referred
    to supporting the appellant financially between 2002 and 2005 from  his
    father's money.  No documentation had been adduced to show  that.   The
    tenancy documents produced by the  appellant  did  not  show  that  the
    sponsor was the head of  the  household.   Documents  relating  to  the
    sponsor's financial means during the period for 2002 to 2005 in Nigeria
    and 2007 and 2008 in Belgium were non-existent.  Thus it was  that  the
    appeal was dismissed on the basis of those conclusions.

51.  I find nothing in the evidence, as currently presented,  to  engage  or
    challenge those particular findings. Little further  evidence,  whether
    financial or in terms of property, has been presented  to  support  the
    contention of either of financial support and dependency  or  residence
    in the sponsor's household over the period before the appellant came to
    the United Kingdom.  The evidence as presented by  both  appellant  and
    sponsor was exceedingly vague.  According to the sponsor he  has  given
    considerable financial assistance to the appellant in  paying  for  the
    flat in which they both lived and subsequently  keeping  on  that  flat
    when he was  in  Belgium  for  many  years  he  mainly  supporting  the
    appellant.  I find it, therefore, to lack  credibility  that  when  the
    appellant is aged 24, at a time that the sponsor is about to leave  for
    Belgium, that he cannot even remember what the appellant was doing with
    himself in terms of work or study nor that he  seemed  to  have  little
    idea as to what the appellant was doing over the period 2002 to 2007.

52.   The  claim  to  be  financially  supporting  the   appellant   is   in
    contradiction to the evidence that had been  previously  presented,  as
    noted by Judge Storey, of a much more limited period 2002  to  2005  as
    rendering financial support.

53.  I find as a matter of common sense that if  the  sponsor  had  been  so
    closely associated with the appellant as claimed, he  would  have  been
    better informed as to what the appellant was doing. There has  been  no
    financial documentation to support the dependency aspect or any further
    evidence as to residence.

54.  Whether or not the  appellant  has  ever  lived  with  the  sponsor  in
    Belgium is also a matter of inconsistency and discrepancy.  The sponsor
    said that the appellant  arrived  in  2007.   The  appellant  indicated
    previously that he arrived in 2008.  The sponsor in his evidence before
    me indicated that he came to the United Kingdom  in  2007  as  did  the
    appellant.  He cannot remember when he had come in that year  nor  when
    the appellant had come or indeed when either had moved  to  the  United
    Kingdom.  The statement of the appellant itself contains a  significant
    discrepancy.  At paragraph 2 the appellant says  that  he  entered  the
    United Kingdom in December 2008 whereas in paragraph 6 that he moved to
    the United Kingdom in 2007 and that the sponsor  moved  to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2007 but he could not remember at which month.

55.  The Belgian identity card relating  to  the  sponsor  valid  from  16th
    April 2008 to 16th April 2013.

56.  The evidence of the sponsor was that the appellant had come to  Belgium
    as a visitor.  If I find that the discrepancies fundamentally undermine
    the credibility  of  the  account  as  presented  by  the  sponsor  and
    appellant I find, therefore, that on the balance of  probabilities  the
    appellant has not resided at any material stage prior to coming to  the
    United Kingdom in the household of the sponsor nor that he was  at  any
    stage prior to or approximate to coming to the United Kingdom in anyway
    dependent upon the sponsor.

57.  In those terms the appellant has failed to establish any dependency  or
    residence prior to coming to the United Kingdom.  No evidence that  has
    been adduced has in any sense challenged the findings of Judge  Storey,
    but rather serves simply to re-enforce them.   On  those  findings  the
    appeal will fail.

58.  However I do consider the  evidence  as  to  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Again I find  it  to  be  undermining  of  credibility  that,
    although the appellant claims to have resided with the sponsor for  the
    number of years, he was particularly vague as to what sort of work  the
    sponsor conducted.  There is a tenancy agreement that is relied upon at
    page 9 of the appellant's bundle relating to [~] in Peterborough  dated
    3rd January 2013 as to show the tenants in that property as  being  the
    sponsor and the appellant.  I place little weight upon that document as
    I note that although the sponsor said  he  was  married  there  was  no
    indication of his wife as a tenant in that property either.

59.  I have little doubt from the  documents  provided  that  the  appellant
    resided at the various addresses which have been  given.  Significantly
    the majority of the documents presented relate to the appellant  living
    at those addresses various bills and statements addressed to him rather
    than the sponsor.

60.  The aspect  of  finance  has  already  been  considered.   I  note  the
    appellant's bank statements that have been adduced showing from time to
    time payments from the sponsor into such accounts in the sums  of  �100
    or less.  The question of course arises why, if they were living at the
    same household it was necessary, to make  such  transfers  through  the
    bank.

61.  For the sake of fairness, however, it is right  to  note  that  in  the
    bundle as presented there are other letters, such as from  the  Halifax
    Building   Society   addressed   to   the   sponsor   at,    certainly,
    [Peterborough].  They are fairly infrequent. The fact that a letter  is
    addressed to a particular person at a particular address does  not,  of
    itself, necessarily denote that that person lives in that  property  as
    his primary residence or provides any indication as to who is the  head
    of the household so far as residence at those addresses  is  concerned.
    It is also relevant, in terms of the overall assessment  of  the  claim
    throughout and particularly the assessment of the evidence given as  to
    residence in the United Kingdom or before, to bear in  mind  the  fraud
    committed by Daniel and admitted by him  as  set  out  in  the  various
    documents. That the sponsor and appellant were  unaware  of  the  fraud
    cannot in common sense be accepted. The evidence,  as  adduced  by  the
    respondent, is that the very person who is identified as Daniel in  the
    application made by the sponsor on 8th March 2010 with  the  photograph
    attached, has been identified by the same photograph and  has  admitted
    that he is not that person as claimed.

62.  There may well be a brother-in-law by that name as shown in the  family
    tree. If the person who is described as Daniel living with the  sponsor
    and the appellant is in fact not Daniel it  defies  common  sense  that
    neither  would  know  that.   As  both  have  agreed  they  have   long
    association with Daniel the half-brother or  cousin  and  it  would  be
    immediately apparent that the person using that name is not him.

63.  It would have been entirely possible for the sponsor  to  come  to  the
    United Kingdom in the exercise  of  his  treaty  rights  as  a  Belgian
    national and to have made an application for the appellant to join him.
     That was not done. The  appellant  for  whatever  reason  entered  the
    United Kingdom illegally and sought to associate himself in  the  claim
    that is made.  Significantly it was admitted by Daniel that the purpose
    of taking that identity was in order to secure entry clearance.  I have
    no doubt, having looked at the evidence, that the sponsor was party  to
    that deception. I find that the appellant was well aware  that  such  a
    deception was being practised. He would have  known  straightaway  that
    the person who purported to be  half-brother  of  the  sponsor  in  the
    application, to which he was also party, was not in fact  that  person.
    I find therefore that  there  has  been  a  contrived  presentation  of
    identity of Daniel to promote the obtaining of  a  residence  card  for
    both Daniel and for the appellant.

64.  As I have indicated this finding is not determinative  of  the  appeal,
    as I have already found that Regulation 8 of  the  ECHR  has  not  been
    satisfied as to residence or dependence prior to entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom on the evidence as presented. However the evidence  as  to  the
    fraud perpetrated upon the authorities is such that in any event  would
    fundamentally undermine the credibility  of  the  sponsor  and  of  the
    appellant.

65.  Dr Onipede submits on behalf of both, that it would be unfair  to  take
    such a view given that neither have been questioned or charged with the
    matter.  I take that comment into account.  It  is  perhaps  surprising
    that the authorities did not take action to revoke the  residence  card
    of the appellant earlier but it has been made abundantly clear  in  the
    decision under challenge the basis upon which refusal  has  been  made.
    Such has provided ample time for the appellant to  obtain  any  further
    evidence relating to the matter that would challenge it.

66.  Given the attempt to deceive the authorities I can place little  weight
    upon the documents as presented, particularly those of the  sponsor  in
    this case.

67.   Dr Onipede produces a claim for costs for the hearing in light of  the
    comments made by Judge Reed at paragraph  40  of  her  decision  as  to
    whether the respondent should bear the costs of the hearing, which  may
    not have been necessary had the material been  served  timeously.   The
    respondent was put on notice that that was a matter to be determined at
    the next hearing.  In the event the applicant's summary  of  costs  was
    only served on the morning of the hearing and  consequently  Mr  Walker
    has not had the opportunity of responding to it.  I shall allow 21 days
    for any response which the respondent wishes  to  make  on  that  issue
    before determining what costs if any I should make.

Notice of Decision

The appeal in respect of the EEA Regulations  is  dismissed.  The  issue  of
costs shall be reserved.

No anonymity direction is made.
