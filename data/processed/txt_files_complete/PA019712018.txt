Representation:
For the appellant:     Miss E Rotherford, Counsel, instructed by M and K
                    Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Presenting Officer.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born June 1975. She is
       educated to degree level. She has visited the United Kingdom on a
       number of occasions. She came here in 2006 and remained for four
       months. She came again in 2009. The third visit was in July 2010. She
       has remained ever since, breaching the terms of her Visa.

    2. In December 2012 she sought to remain on the basis of article 8
       rights. The application was refused in January 2016. Her appeal in
       September 2016 was dismissed.

    3. The appellant made a claim for protection in July 2017. At that stage
       she was pregnant. She was screened on 28 July 2017. She gave birth to
       a son, Abdullah, on 21 October 2017.Her substantive interview took
       place on 22 January 2018.

    4. She claimed that his child's father is a British national and they
       are no longer in a relationship. She claims her child is illegitimate
       and therefore both she and the child would be at risk on return.
       Beyond naming the father at screening she would provide no other
       details.

    5. She repeated her claim that she was estranged from her family because
       she would not take part in an arranged marriage in Pakistan. She
       claimed to continue to be at risk in Pakistan because of this and the
       bulb of her interview was concerned with this.

    6. The respondent refused her claim only 24th January 2018. The bulk of
       the refusal letter is concerned with her claim of being at risk
       because she rejected an arranged marriage in Pakistan. The refusal
       rejects the appellant's credibility, pointing out she failed to make
       this claim on arrival 10 years ago and that this claim has already
       been dealt with and rejected on appeal. It is only later in the
       refusal letter when the question of internal relocation is considered
       that the child features. This is considered in the context of the
       appellant being returned as a lone female and single parent. The
       child is then considered in the context of article 8 at paragraph 104
       of the decision onwards.

    7. Her appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chambers on 22
       August 2018 and in a decision promulgated on 24 August 2018 was
       dismissed. Again, the focus was on the arranged marriage claim. The
       judge rejected her claim in relation to this. Regarding the
       appellant's son, Judge Chambers concluded she had not demonstrated
       the child was British. The judge concluded she could return with her
       child and relocate if necessary.

The error of law hearing

    8. Following a hearing on 2 May 2019 I found a material error of law in
       that the judge failed to make clear findings as to whether it was
       accepted the child was illegitimate. I preserved the rejection of the
       claim relating to an arranged marriage. The matter was to be relisted
       in the Upper Tribunal.

    9. A central issue was the consideration of the child's status and the
       impact of this upon the appellant's ability to return to Pakistan.
       Whilst I could not speculate I had raised with the appellant's
       Counsel the possibility the appellant had undergone an Islamic
       religious ceremony of marriage here. In that situation then under
       Islamic law the child  would be legitimate.

   10. I had issued Directions to the parties that they be in a position to
       make submissions on legitimacy and how the appellant would be
       perceived, irrespective of the child's status. If the claim was being
       advanced on the basis the child is British then adequate proof was
       expected.

The resumed Upper Tribunal hearing

   11. I have received a skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant.
       Disappointingly, this does not address the issues raised in my
       Directions but continues on the assumption the appellant would be
       returned as the mother of an illegitimate child. As stated, the
       refusal letter did not clearly address this issue. The focus in the
       refusal was primarily upon the claim of an arranged marriage. The
       appellant was simply described as a single parent. The First-tier
       Tribunal decision had also focused principally on the question of the
       arranged marriage. I had set the decision aside because of the
       failure of the judge to make a clear finding about the child's
       status. Consequently, the appellant's representatives should have
       been clear as to what the outstanding issues where.

   12. There is source material for argument on the point but it is not for
       me to carry out independent research. There are statutory and common
       law presumptions on legitimacy and no doubt similar provisions in
       Pakistan which could have been argued. This issue has arisen in
       relation to claims made by children under the British Nationality Act
       and the British Nationality(Proof of Paternity Amendment)Regulations
       2015.Such matters were considered, for instance, in K (A child) -v-
       SSHD [2018] EWHC 1834 and in R(on the application of Johnson -v-
       SSHD) [2016]UKSC 56.There has been an enquiry into whether Sharia
       marriages in the United Kingdom should be registered.

   13. It is for the appellant to establish she is entitled to protection.
       On the remaining issues in the appeal in the Upper Tribunal it is for
       her to establish that her child is entitled to British citizenship
       and that the child will be perceived as illegitimate in Pakistan.

   14. Mr Bates acknowledge that if the child is illegitimate then he will
       face difficulties in Pakistan and suggested if this were my finding
       the appeal could succeed on the basis of article 8. He did accept
       that the appellant had been consistent in her account about the child
       being illegitimate and the birth certificate produced does not name
       his father. He said he had attempted to carry out checks on the name
       of the father without success. He did query why the appellant had not
       sought to obtain maintenance from the father given her apparent
       straitened circumstances.

   15. The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined. Her child,
       Abdullah, was born on 21st October 2017. The appellant said that she
       last had contact with his father when she was three months pregnant.
       Allowing for the normal gestation period the conception would have
       occurred towards the end of January 2017.Therefore, on her account
       contact with the child's father ended towards the end of April
       2017.She said she attempted to contact him after by telephone without
       success. She said she was unaware of his friends or acquaintances.

   16. In cross-examination she was asked how long she had been in a
       relationship with the child's father. She said she had been with him
       7-8 months. She claimed to have little knowledge of him. She said she
       did not know where he lived and had never met his friends or
       acquaintances. She was asked where they would meet. She said they met
       in a coffee shop. She also said that he rented a room in Manchester
       and that she lived with him there for a number of months. Regarding
       her own address, she had resided there two years. She said she had
       asked to meet his family but this had never happened.

   17. She said when she realised she was pregnant she told the child's
       father. At that stage he told her that he was married and had
       children with his wife. Consequently, he was not prepared to
       acknowledge his son.

   18. She was asked how she knew he was British. She said on occasion she
       had seen him with a passport which he had used to book flights.

   19. She claimed a lack of knowledge about her own family. She confirmed
       she had been in the United Kingdom now 10 years without permission.
       She said that her mother and brother lived in Luton. She said her
       mother came a few months after she arrived. She said she was not
       contact with either. She confirmed she had a sister in Pakistan and
       also said she had no contact with her. She denied any possible family
       support in Pakistan.

   20. I asked the appellant for some more details about the relationship
       with the child's father. She said they met in July 2016.The
       relationship became sexual in January 2017, with her quickly becoming
       pregnant. She said they had cohabited for between two and three
       months. She had no documents to show a common address.

   21. I asked how she had been supporting herself in the past 10 years. She
       said she works as a volunteer with the elderly and on occasion they
       would give her small sums such as �5-�10. She also said that the
       child's father gave her gifts when they were together. She confirmed
       the baby had been safely delivered and was well.

   22. In submissions, the presenting officer continued to rely on the
       reasons for refusal letter. He said the appellant's credibility was
       in issue. He questioned the likelihood of her supporting herself as
       described. Her claim of estrangement from her family related to
       events in Pakistan. However, the First tier judge had rejected this
       and that finding had been preserved. Consequently, there was no
       explanation for an ongoing estrangement and lack of contact.

   23. He questioned why she had not sought maintenance from the child's
       father, particularly given her account of relying on elderly people
       giving her money. He accepted that if I found the child was
       illegitimate then, as a lone parent without family, mother and child
       faced significant obstacles to reintegration and the appeal could
       succeed on article 8 grounds on the basis paragraph 276 ADE(vi). He
       continued to resist the appeal being allowed on the basis of
       protection grounds.

   24. In response, the appellant's representative acknowledged that if the
       appellant had engaged in an Islamic marriage ceremony here she would
       be recognised as married in Pakistan. However, she submitted the
       appellant's child was born outside wedlock. She said the appellant
       had given a consistent account.

   25. I was referred to the birth certificate not naming the father. While
       she had not sought maintenance from the father it was pointed out she
       said she did not know where he lives. She did attempt to phone him
       without success. In the circumstance she said it was not surprising
       he would be seeking to avoid her and not want to introduce her to his
       wife and family.

   26. As a lone woman without family support she will face difficulties in
       Pakistan. It was submitted that in general women in the Pakistan do
       not live alone. Where a husband was working abroad there would
       normally be wider family support. Absent this, the appellant child
       would be perceived as the illegitimate.

   27. The question of her child's legitimacy would surface when she sought
       registration, for instance, for school. She submitted as the mother
       of an illegitimate child the police would not protect her. If she
       attempted to relocate as a single mother she would stand out. She
       would face difficulty in getting employment and accommodation.
       Shelters would not provide a long-term solution. She submitted in the
       circumstance he was entitled to refugee protection.

Consideration

   28. There is an expert report from Prof Menski. This was obtained on
       behalf of the appellant for the original First-tier Tribunal hearing.
       The expert was to advise on the risk to the appellant as an unmarried
       mother. Therein lies a fundamental flaw, as it proceeds on this
       premise. The expert acknowledges the respondent's decision makes
       adverse credibility findings and the expert report should be read
       subject to these. Because the report is based upon the assumption
       that the child is illegitimate it is of limited assistance.
       Nevertheless, it does contain information relevant to the position on
       return.

   29. The expert makes the point that Pakistan is an Islamic country and
       extramarital relations are considered Zina and a grave infringement.
       She referred to the risk of extra judicial punishment including
       honour killings by family members or extremist groups. She refers to
       statutory penalties which make it illegal to have sexual intercourse
       outside of marriage. There is reference to stoning to death albeit
       the expert states that no person so far has been so punished by the
       State. There is also the offense of fornication under the penal code
       which can lead to 5 years imprisonment. At paragraph 21 of her report
       the expert refers to a requirement of very strong evidence. This
       includes four male witnesses although she refers to childbirth being
       used as evidence in one case, albeit pregnancy itself would not be
       sufficient to prove guilt. Rather, she describes giving birth as
       circumstantial proof.

   30. The expert deals with the question of relocation. Again, this assumes
       the appellant is a mother of an illegitimate child. She states that
       individuals in such situations are often tracked down by their own
       families.

   31. The expert concludes that as a mother of an illegitimate child she
       would face prosecution and there was also a real risk of honour
       killing. Whilst laws have been passed prohibiting so-called honour
       killings there is rising violence against women generally in
       Pakistan. The expert concluded there would not be sufficiency of
       protection. She also comments that whilst there are private sheltered
       homes these have failed to protect women from violence. She suggests
       that the appellant can be located through the Nadra system.

   32. The expert then refers to the risk of the appellant's child, again on
       the basis he is illegitimate. She refers to the stigma attached to
       illegitimacy and the fact that in Pakistan the name of the father is
       needed for important documents. Illegitimate child would not have a
       right of inheritance and could not be registered with the national
       database without a father. She points out that even highly qualified
       and educated women suffer discrimination in Pakistan.

Findings.

   33. In a protection claim the standard of proof is relatively low. The
       appellant must demonstrate a real risk. Nevertheless, the burden of
       proof is upon her. In relation to her family and her child's
       paternity she has provided very little information and claims
       ignorance of most matters. I am conscious of the religious background
       of the appellant and the stigma attached to illegitimacy in Muslim
       society.

   34. I do not find it established that the appellant is a mother of an
       illegitimate child. The expert report and the information confirms
       the conservative nature of Pakistan and the taboo against
       extramarital sexual relations. This is particularly so for the
       female. I do not find the appellant's account of her relationship
       with the child's father credible.

   35. I do not find it credible she would know absolutely nothing about
       him. She claimed they had been living together for several months and
       has provided no evidence to support this. She has made no effort to
       trace him . On her account she has been without income and living on
       gifts received from elderly people she does charitable works for.
       There is no evidence she has sought maintenance from the father of
       her child, for instance through the government agencies.

   36. I appreciate he is not mentioned in the child's birth certificate and
       the appellant has consistently said she was not married to him.
       However, I do not find these claims and her consistent denial
       sufficient to make the claim credible in the circumstance.

   37. She has not established that her child is a British national. Beyond
       her say-so she has provided no evidence to confirm the child's father
       is a British national. He is not identified on the child's birth
       certificate and there is no other evidence to show the child's father
       is British.

   38. I do not accept her claim of estrangement from her own family. This
       is because the underlying basis for that statement, namely, refusal
       to engage in an arranged marriage was not accepted by First-tier
       judge. She had said her elder brother is living in Luton and that her
       mother is there also. She has been living there for 10 years until
       recently. Her brother sponsored her in two earlier these
       applications. After she came to the United Kingdom she telephoned her
       mother to say she was well. Absent the arranged marriage claim there
       is no reason for any estrangement. The same applies in relation to
       her sister in Pakistan.

   39. Given my rejection of the estrangement claim she should have the
       support of her family. If her child is not illegitimate and she has
       family in Pakistan then she will in a position similar to that of
       mothers whose husbands are working abroad.

   40. The best interests of the child are paramount consideration. The
       child is only an infant. He will have no awareness of his
       surroundings. She has not established that the child is British and
       as such has an inherent right to be here. Her child would be returned
       to Pakistan with her and so the family unit would be preserved. The
       respondent has given detailed consideration at paragraph 10 to 10 of
       the refusal letter which I would adopt.

   41. It was not suggested she could remain on the basis of her private
       life. The private life was established when her immigration status
       was precarious. I have borne in mind the considerations in section
       117 B. There was no evidence to show competency in English or that
       she and her child would not be a drain on the public purse.

Decision

I remake the decision, dismissing the appeal on protection and human rights
grounds.
