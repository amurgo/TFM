Representation:

For the Secretary of State:  Ms. K. Evans,  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
                       Officer.
For  the  Respondent:           Miss  J.  Ndeti,  of  Victor  Evans  &   Co.
                       Solicitors.

1.    The Secretary of State has  appealed,  with  permission,  against  the
     Determination of Ms. J.  Balloch,  an  Adjudicator,  who  (following  a
     hearing on 17th October 2003 at Hatton Cross)  purportedly  allowed  on
     human rights grounds (Article 3 of the ECHR) the appeal of Miss  Abraha
     (who is a national of Eritrea and whose date of birth is given  as  1st
     January 1987) against the Secretary of State's decision of  10th  April
     2003 to grant limited leave to enter and to refuse her asylum claim.

2.    It is important to note that the appeal of Miss Abraha (who  we  shall
     hereafter refer to as the Claimant) was brought under Section 83(2)  of
     the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (the  2002  Act).  As
     will be apparent, the Claimant is a  minor.  She  was  granted  limited
     leave to enter until 31st December 2004 -  that is, a period  of  leave
     exceeding one year. This fact  brought her within the terms of  Section
     83(1) of the 2002 Act. Section 83(2) gives a person  who  falls  within
     the terms of Section 83(1) a right of appeal to an Adjudicator  against
     the rejection of his (or her) asylum claim.

3.    This Determination is reported in  order  to  give  Adjudicators  some
     general guidance on the ambit of an appeal brought under Section 83(2).
     We  deal  with  whether,  in  such  an  appeal,  an   Adjudicator   has
     jurisdiction to consider human rights issues.

4.    In the  grounds  of  application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the
     Tribunal, the Secretary of State asserts that the Adjudicator had erred
     in allowing the appeal  under  Article  3  because  she  did  not  have
     jurisdiction to consider human rights issues. Reliance is placed on the
     Tribunal's Determination in [2003] UKIAT 00017 P (Yugoslavia).

5.    At paragraphs 13 to 17 of the Determination, the Adjudicator gave  her
     reasons for concluding that she  had  jurisdiction  to  consider  human
     rights issues in this appeal. Her reasons can be summarised as follows:

      (a)   that  the  Claimant  had  raised  human  rights  issues  in  the
           "Statement of Additional Grounds";

      (b)   that the Notice of the decision states that there is a right  of
           appeal and also lists the grounds of appeal. This list  includes
           the following:

            that the decision is lawful  because  it  is  incompatible  with
                 [the Claimant's] rights under the  European  Convention  on
                 Human Rights.

      (c)   that the fact that the Claimant had raised human  rights  issues
           in the "Statement of Additional Grounds" means that human rights
           issues were a "matter" which the Adjudicator  was  entitled,  or
           was required, to consider under Section 85(4) and Section 86.

6.    At the hearing before us,  Miss  Ndeti  made  brief  submissions.  The
     substance of her submissions were to the effect that the  situation  in
     Eritrea is now worse than that found to be the case by the Adjudicator.
      In responding to  our  enquiry  as  to  whether  the  Adjudicator  had
     jurisdiction to consider human rights issues, Miss Ndeti reiterated the
     same point -  i.e. that the objective evidence about Eritrea shows that
     the  general  situation  in  Eritrea  has  deteriorated.   Miss   Ndeti
     subsequently accepted that the Adjudicator did not have jurisdiction to
     consider any human rights issues.

7.    We announced that we allowed the Secretary of State's  appeal  against
     the Adjudicator's decision to allow  the  Claimant's  appeal  on  human
     rights grounds. We give our reasons below.

8.    The Adjudicator correctly recognised that the  Claimant's  appeal  was
     brought under Section 83(2) of the 2002 Act. This section is  the  only
     statutory provision which confers on a  person  who  has  been  refused
     asylum but who has been granted limited leave a right of appeal  to  an
     Adjudicator for a determination of his or her asylum  claim.  We  would
     draw the attention of Adjudicators to the fact that the right of appeal
     is only given to persons who  are  granted  a  period,  or  periods  in
     aggregate, exceeding one year.

9.    It is clear, from Section 83(2) that such appeal is  brought  "against
     the rejection of the asylum claim".  This is important, because it sets
     out the scope of the jurisdiction before the Adjudicator on  an  appeal
     under Section 83(2) - i.e. the  substantive  issue  in  the  appeal  is
     limited to the asylum claim.

10.   This is reinforced by the provisions of Section 84(3), which states:

            An appeal under section 83 must be brought on the  grounds  that
           removal of the appellant from the United  Kingdom  would  breach
           the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention.

11.   In the instant appeal, the Adjudicator  erred  in  construing  Section
     85(4) as conferring on her a human rights jurisdiction.  Section  85(4)
     and (5) state:

            (4)  On an  appeal  under  section  82(1)  or  83(2)  against  a
           decision an adjudicator may consider evidence about  any  matter
           which he thinks relevant  to  the  substance  of  the  decision,
           including evidence which concerns a  matter  arising  after  the
           date of the decision.

            (5)  But in relation to an appeal under  section  82(1)  against
           refusal of entry  clearance  or  refusal  of  a  certificate  of
           entitlement under section 10-
                 (a)   subsection (4) shall not apply, and
                 (b)   the adjudicator may consider only  the  circumstances
                 appertaining at the time of the decision to refuse.

            (our emphasis)

12.   When read together, it is clear  that  sub-sections  (4)  and  (5)  of
     Section 85 are intended to deal with the evidence which an  Adjudicator
     may take into account in dealing  with  the  appeal.  In  the  case  of
     appeals which fall within sub-section  (5),  an  Adjudicator  may  only
     consider "the circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision to
     refuse". In all other appeals brought under section 82(1) or 83(2), sub-
     section (4) of Section  85  provides  that  the  evidence  may  include
     evidence which arises after the date of the decision, provided that the
     evidence is about a matter which the Adjudicator considers is "relevant
     to the substance of the decision". In the case of appeals brought under
     Section 83(2), the words "relevant to the substance  of  the  decision"
     mean that such matters have to be relevant to the asylum claim. This is
     the limitation imposed by virtue of sub-section (2) of Section 83.

13.   As we have stated, the statutory provisions make  it  clear  that  the
     ambit of an appeal brought under Section 83(2)  is  limited  to  asylum
     grounds. Additionally, the Tribunal made it clear in [2003] UKIAT 00017
     P (Yugoslavia) that, where removal is not imminent, a  claim  on  human
     rights grounds cannot succeed. In this  case,  the  Claimant  has  been
     granted leave to enter until 31st December 2004. Before the  expiry  of
     that leave, she would be entitled to apply  for  an  extension  of  her
     leave. If the Secretary of State refuses that  application,  she  would
     have a right of appeal against that decision - that is to say, she  has
     available a further effective remedy. Accordingly, as at  the  date  of
     hearing before the Adjudicator (and indeed,  as  at  the  date  of  the
     hearing before us), there is no meaningful sense in which it  could  be
     said that there was an imminent threat of removal. This means that  her
     human rights claim could not succeed  before  the  Adjudicator  in  any
     event, irrespective of the jurisdiction issue.

14.   As the Adjudicator correctly noted, the Notice of  the  decision  does
     list, under the heading "Right of appeal", that there  is  a  right  of
     appeal on the following ground:

            that the decision is lawful  because  it  is  incompatible  with
                 [the Claimant's] rights under the  European  Convention  on
                 Human Rights.

15.   This is an error in the Notice of the decision. Such  a  error  cannot
     confer jurisdiction, where none is provided for by  legislation.  There
     is no question of any legitimate expectation arising on account of such
     an error, as we believe it to be settled law that a right of appeal  to
     an Adjudicator must be conferred by statue and cannot  be  acquired  by
     arguments as to legitimate expectation. The Secretary of State may wish
     to take steps to correct  the  standard  form  of  the  Notice  of  the
     decision which is used in cases where there is a right of appeal  under
     Section 83(2). It seems to us  clear  that  the  list  of  the  various
     grounds set out in the notice is entirely inappropriate and  should  be
     deleted, in order to avoid similar misunderstandings in the future.

16.   For the reasons we  have  given  above,  we  are  satisfied  that  the
     Adjudicator's decision to allow the  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds
     cannot be allowed to stand.

17.   It only remains for us to deal briefly with Miss Ndeti's  submissions.
     As we have said, they were to the effect that the situation in  Eritrea
     is worse  than  the  Adjudicator  had  found.  This  goes  towards  the
     substance of the asylum claim. However, the Adjudicator's  decision  to
     dismiss the appeal on asylum grounds was not  been  challenged  by  the
     Claimant.  Accordingly, the asylum claim was not before us.

18.   It follows that we must allow the Secretary of State's appeal.

      Decision:

      The Secretary of State's appeal is ALLOWED.
